1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:13,400
He was son of God and He came on this Earth
with a very great message that you are to

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,219
be resurrected.

3
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:26,810
It is not only that you have to maintain yourself,
and you don’t eat this and don’t do that

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:35,739
and all those Ten Commandments, but He came
to give us a message of our rebirth.

5
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:42,770
We are to be born again; not by any just a
ritual or some sort of a ceremony we go through,

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:52,110
but there has to be something living that
has to take place.

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,550
He has always talked about [the] living God.

8
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,680
So something living must happen and what happens
when it is something living?

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:08,039
When it is something living we start finding
the transformation taking place.

10
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:13,579
For example: you sow a seed and the living
process starts; the tree starts transforming

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:25,200
into the root and a shoot; and then the shoot
start transforming itself into leaves and

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,409
then into fruits.

13
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:36,950
It’s not static: not that we take one piece
from here and keep it there and it is transformed,

14
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:48,759
but there is something that happens within,
something very spontaneous which brings forth

15
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:55,249
this transformation and you see it with your
own eyes.

16
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,520
And this transformation has to take place
within you.

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:08,569
Now, in a case as I told you of Cathy or someone
like that one can say all right you must have

18
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,790
consoled or you give her love and this and
that she be consoled, but that’s not the

19
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,790
point.

20
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:24,000
As I told you there are many people who have
got everything, still they are unhappy.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,100
And if you ask them they will say, “No,
we don’t know.

22
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,190
We are not happy.

23
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,190
We don’t feel happy.

24
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,330
There’s no joy in our lives.

25
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,400
We have lost our heart."

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
They can’t explain but it is there.

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,220
What have they lost?

28
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:56,380
The time has come for the whole world to know
their Spirit.

29
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,769
This is the time which is prophesised even
by William Blake where he describes England

30
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,110
is the Jerusalem.

31
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:11,610
The time has come for you to know your Spirit.

32
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,240
That has to happen.

33
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:20,480
It’s not a thing by which I tell you, you
stand on your heads or hold your nose or start

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,720
taking some names, like a one track mind going
on chanting some names like madcaps.

35
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:35,330
It’s not that, but something that must happen
within yourself and that must transform you.

36
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:43,850
Of course, one must understand [that] if it
is a living process, you cannot pay for it.

37
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,652
How can you pay for a seed to sprout?

38
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:53,800
The seed doesn’t understand; the living
process doesn’t understand money.

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,970
It’s the dead work of human beings.

40
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,980
How can you organise it also?

41
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
You cannot! It’s spontaneous.

42
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,980
There is no technique.

43
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
It’s all built-in.

44
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,290
The technique is built: in the little seed
that you see, the whole technique of its growth

45
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,290
is built-in.

46
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,220
The technique is built-in and all its maps,
how it is going to be, what tree it is going

47
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:25,800
to be, how the tree is going to grow, in what
height, in what thickness, everything is inside

48
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,159
that seed.

49
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:36,990
In the same way it is a spontaneous thing,
which has to happen within you and if it is

50
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,169
so we have to find out.

51
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:44,490
That’s how the search started: people went
to India, went all over the places to find

52
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,490
out.

53
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,870
They thought we cannot find the solution here
let us go up there.

54
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:57,270
It has to be that way, because if you grow
too much outside you have to find out your

55
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,650
roots.

56
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:06,870
Because you develop that fear that you may
not be able to sustain this outward growth

57
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:16,030
unless and until you find out the depth or
the source on which this is to be sustained.

58
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,590
So people started searching and searching.

59
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:27,580
I have met many of them, many thousands, and
I find they were misled many a times.

60
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,689
They were really misled.

61
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:37,300
They were so anxious to get to it that whatever
somebody said they just accepted blindfolded.

62
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,740
People asked for money, all right take money.

63
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:50,199
They starved themselves, collected money and
gave this to these swindlers and these cheats

64
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,419
and thugs.

65
00:05:52,419 --> 00:06:00,009
How can anybody exchange money for the Spirit?

66
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,729
It’s absurd! It’s illogical.

67
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:11,610
But we understand money to such a great extent,
I was amazed, that we think that Spirit can

68
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:19,419
be bought by giving some money to someone,
or some sort of a material thing.

69
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:27,850
Logically all these things have to be understood.

70
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:36,999
Now to say that logically you cannot understand
God, is wrong.

71
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,750
You can, logically; not rationally but logically.

72
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,419
There’s a difference between the two.

73
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,265
For example, if you have not come to London,
you have not seen London, I have not been

74
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:48,720
to Newbury, I did not know it’s a beautiful
place like this, then I cannot understand

75
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
it.

76
00:06:49,720 --> 00:07:00,779
But if I have come here, then I see with my
own eyes, “Yes it is so."

77
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:06,110
Then I have to say, “Yes I have seen it.

78
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,289
It’s so."

79
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:12,029
I have seen it, I have felt it.

80
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,900
I know it is so.

81
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,569
Then it becomes, the whole thing becomes logical.

82
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,099
But rationally if I sit in India somewhere
in the corner and think of Newbury, “Now

83
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,400
I am going to Newbury."

84
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:33,499
Just putting my wings of imagination outside:
will I come to Newbury?

85
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:43,629
But if I come, this is very important to understand,
if I come here, actually I come here, in person,

86
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:50,899
then I know the place and I know the people
of Newbury and I know it.

87
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:56,310
That means it has to be an actualisation.

88
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,869
If it is not an actualisation then whatever
you decide about it, this way or that, way

89
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:06,400
is absolutely illogical, because you have
not been there; very simple as that.

90
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,680
Some people say, “We believe in God."

91
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,289
Some people say, “We don’t believe in
God."

92
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:17,219
Both ways, whatever they are saying, they
are doing it I don’t know how.

93
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:24,180
If they believe in God, maybe it’s innately
built in us to believe in God.

94
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:32,680
But even they don’t believe in God, it’s
all right, because they don’t understand;

95
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,710
they have not been there.

96
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:49,410
But you must keep yourself open: open to understand
that if something has to happen to us, which

97
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:57,030
is a living process, some transformation has
to take place within us.

98
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:04,380
It has to be an actualisation, not a lecture
to you or a sermon to you, or some sort of

99
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,110
a service and then you disperse.

100
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:16,820
You must start feeling some transformation
coming within.

101
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:23,890
In the Bible itself, it is written: “I will
appear before you like tongues of flames."

102
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:31,680
Nobody can explain what it is like; they cannot.

103
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:44,330
It is written that: “The Tree of Life will
be fed by the water of life."

104
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,330
It’s a prophecy.

105
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,660
Now what is Tree of Life?

106
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,190
Where is it?

107
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,730
Where does it exist within us?

108
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,240
Nobody has tried to find out.

109
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,780
They say, “You must have faith."

110
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,910
“Yes, whatever is said is true.

111
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,910
You must have faith."

112
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:11,670
But if you have faith, after some time you
will be disillusioned.

113
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,360
That’s blind, absolutely blind.

114
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:22,190
Because where is that Tree of Life, you have
not seen, felt or it has not manifested.

115
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:31,100
For this we can refer to other scriptures
also, specially in India where people have

116
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,490
been more meditative.

117
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:42,510
As you have been more outward and seeking
[the] overpowering of matter, in India people

118
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,500
tried to find out what’s happening within.

119
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I mean there are genuine people also, not
all are thugs.

120
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,200
They are not in the market.

121
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,340
They are hiding themselves somewhere in Himalayas
and all these places.

122
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:07,410
But in the sixth century only, we have the
description of The Tree of Life.

123
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,550
And the Tree of Life is shown here as you
see.

124
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:20,630
Now you are not to have blind faith in what
I am saying, there’s no need.

125
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,620
But you should not also deny me.

126
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:32,800
You should try to understand what I am saying
and see for yourself [if] it works out or

127
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
not.

128
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,420
If it does not work out we give another chance
to you.

129
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:48,670
Because you must know that I have come here
to give you something, not take anything from

130
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,670
you.

131
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,790
I cannot take, that’s my nature.

132
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,360
That’s how God has made me.

133
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,610
It’s something funny, but I cannot take
anything.

134
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:10,040
If I have come to give you then there’s
nothing selling, there’s no shop.

135
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,890
Try! If you should be open it would help you
better to understand what I am trying to tell

136
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,890
you.

137
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:29,940
Here now, you see the Tree of Life (chakra
chart) and when this Tree of Life is given

138
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,380
the water of life then what happens?

139
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,630
How the nourishment reaches?

140
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,110
And how it starts activating?

141
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,700
It is as simple as connecting this machine
to the mains.

142
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:55,800
Any machine, say a television is there, once
it is connected to the mains you can see the

143
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,440
manifestation of the machine very clearly.

144
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,750
And you are amazed [that] for a villager,
if you show, that he is surprised, and he

145
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,480
cannot understand how this is happening, how
are these pictures coming, from where these

146
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,510
music is coming, how these colours have been
shown.

147
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,700
He can’t understand it.

148
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:31,350
In the same way, once your machine becomes
connected, connected, with the Divine you

149
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:37,430
start finding Its manifestation.

150
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:48,200
Now in this picture we have shown you here
the subtle being that exists within us: just

151
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,890
like a structure of a seed you can say.

152
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:58,520
As in the seed there is a primule of the germinating
power.

153
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:14,870
In the same way, in that triangular bone is
the power which is going to give us rebirth.

154
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,660
This is your own.

155
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,680
This is your Mother who is going to give you
your rebirth.

156
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,960
She exists in all of us.

157
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,020
She is dormant, but She knows everything about
you.

158
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,800
She is like a tape recorder.

159
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,730
She knows all your past and She knows your
seeking and She knows you value.

160
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,240
She knows your defects and She knows what
mistakes you have committed, who has troubled

161
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,500
you and who has looted you, and who has deceived
you.

162
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,770
She knows everything.

163
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,470
But She is dormant.

164
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:00,130
She lies there in a dormant stage and She
is called as ‘Kundalini’ in the Sanskrit

165
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,130
language.

166
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:07,010
Kundalini is the word [which] comes from the
coiled.

167
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,310
The word ‘Kundalini’ means ‘the coil’.

168
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:18,040
And She is in three and a half coils, coiled
together, and just like, they call it like

169
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,790
a serpent, She is lying down there.

170
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:31,910
But you have seen mostly, most of the energies
are kept in a coil, because if any chord has

171
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,430
to be used we put it in a coil always.

172
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,250
The one end has to come out so it is kept
coiled up there.

173
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:46,940
Why this three and half is also a big mathematics
which, of course later on, you can find out

174
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,390
what is the meaning of this three and half
coils.

175
00:15:52,390 --> 00:16:01,940
Just now, I will just give you a very, very
short description, an outline, about this

176
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,720
power that resides within us.

177
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,710
It resides in the triangular bone called as
sacrum.

178
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:16,500
That is at the back of us, our backbone, at
the lowest point.

179
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,110
You can see there is a triangular bone behind.

180
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,560
Now see this is called as sacrum.

181
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,670
Sacrum means ‘sacred bone’.

182
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:31,050
It has been found out that when the human
body burns this bone does not burn.

183
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,750
That is why they call it sacrum long time
back.

184
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,230
But the reason is the Kundalini is inside
that bone.

185
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:49,330
Now above that, you find there are six centres:
one, two, three, four, five and six.

186
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,890
And the lowest one is below that.

187
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:03,930
All these centres are subtle centres which
manifest outside our plexuses, the physical

188
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,360
plexuses that we know of.

189
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:19,750
These centres exist as energy pockets and
they supply the two lines: you see the blue

190
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,600
and the yellow line.

191
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:34,010
They try to balance and arrange the power
to flow into these two channels.

192
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:44,390
These two channels represent within us, on
the left hand side, the one which comes as

193
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:56,850
the blue line which you see comes actually
from the right side on top and comes down

194
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,810
and meets the first centre there.

195
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:08,140
This is the line of Ida channel which controls
our emotional line.

196
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:15,330
It controls our past and is also called as
moon line.

197
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,640
It is, it represents our desiring power, our
desiring power.

198
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:33,410
The another line you see is the yellow line
which represents our power of action, through

199
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,750
which we act.

200
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,560
First we desire, we want to have something
and then we act.

201
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:50,780
So this line represents your physical and
mental being which goes in the front side

202
00:18:50,780 --> 00:19:04,300
and the left side of the brain and forms the
ego, which is a by-product of our activities

203
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,760
for our actions.

204
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:16,730
The first power of desire or the emotional
power, when it acts, for example say Cathy

205
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,490
was emotionally disturbed: her this power
was acting too much and was using all the

206
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:30,720
power from all the body and was creating a
superego there.

207
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:41,430
So actually on the left hand side and in the
front is the ego and on the right hand side

208
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:50,760
and the back is the superego, covering our
limbic area which is in the brain above this

209
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
centre.

210
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,110
This centre, Agnya, is the centre of Christ.

211
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,680
Christ resides there.

212
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,870
People say Christ is within us.

213
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,280
Where is He?

214
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,440
Which part?

215
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,020
Where is He placed?

216
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,880
He is placed in this centre.

217
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,630
Now when I say that He is placed in there,
we can prove it.

218
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,220
It can easily proved, because when the Kundalini
rises and if She stops at that centre — which

219
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:26,170
you can see and feel it, that it has stopped
there — you have to take the name of Christ

220
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,390
and request Him that, “Please allow the
Kundalini to pass."

221
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:36,840
If He is awakened, of course, that can only
be done by a person who is a realised-soul.

222
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:44,400
Any Dick, Tom, Harry cannot do it: you cannot
call Christ or anyone because what is the

223
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,530
right you have got?

224
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:52,300
There has to be a protocol, a connection by
which you can call Him.

225
00:20:52,300 --> 00:21:00,870
Any such person when he calls Christ, He can
be awakened and the Kundalini rises from there:

226
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:07,730
that’s how you know this is the centre of
Christ.

227
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,000
What is the mantra of this centre?

228
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,240
Surprisingly, it is our, Lord’s prayer.

229
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,410
It’s the mantra.

230
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:23,690
It’s not only the Lord’s prayer, it’s
a mantra for this centre.

231
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,130
And the weapon of Christ is forgiveness.

232
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,500
When the Kundalini stops here, that means
you think too much.

233
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:42,230
Imagine all the Christians, or I can say the
Christian nations, think too much.

234
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,000
It’s surprising! We should not think at
all.

235
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,220
I mean Christ has done that for us.

236
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,440
We are not supposed to think.

237
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,030
But we think about everything, we plan about
everything.

238
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,790
We are mad with thinking.

239
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,600
I mean, it grows like a mad weed.

240
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,960
I was in Switzerland, there was a doctor who
came to see me and he said, “Mother, you

241
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,270
can cut my neck or you can break my teeth,
do what you like but stop my thinking!”

242
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,190
He just could not stop thinking.

243
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:22,320
What is the solution for this thinking in
Sahaja Yoga is you have to forgive.

244
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,800
You have to forgive.

245
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,450
If you forgive, then this centre can be resolved.

246
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:37,190
But forgiveness is just a myth, because what
are you doing?

247
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:44,650
If you are troubled by another person, if
you do not forgive that person, that person

248
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,650
is successful.

249
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:52,130
Because you go on worrying about it, crying
about it, weeping about it, and whatever he

250
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:58,500
wanted to trouble you for, you are just a
complete proof of it.

251
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,200
So forgiveness means what?

252
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,010
What you are doing is to get rid of his power
over you.

253
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:12,410
And this is what Christ has said that, “Forgive”
and the greatest thing He did on the cross

254
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,260
was to say that, “Forgive."

255
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,660
Because these people really committed the
real crime of crucifying the Son of God.

256
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,220
But still He said, “Forgive for they do
not know what they are doing”.

257
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:34,530
They do not know what they are doing, that
He was the Son of God.

258
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:40,210
It was impossible for people to believe Son
of God.

259
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,330
Imagine! Is He Son of God?

260
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,270
What makes Him that?

261
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,200
His resurrection proved it.

262
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,120
Till then nobody believed Him.

263
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,940
His disciples never believed Him.

264
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:08,700
He looked like a very ordinary person, carpenter’s
son, having hardly two robes to wear, living

265
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,050
in a very poor condition.

266
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:19,270
What made Him feel that He was the Son of
God?

267
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,559
His own knowledge about Himself.

268
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:31,500
Now supposing, somebody is the Son of God,
what should He do to prove it to human beings

269
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
are just like walls?

270
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,520
Sometimes I find I am talking to walls, absolutely,
or to some people are looking this side, that

271
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,510
side, and they are not understanding what
I am talking.

272
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:49,360
How are we to prove that He was the Son of
God?

273
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,429
It’s an impossibility.

274
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:58,860
And if He was born in modern times He would
have been crucified only when He was five

275
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,040
years of age I can tell you! Because now we
are so ego-oriented.

276
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,900
That time people were stupid but now we think
we are very intelligent: “We know everything!

277
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,180
We know God.

278
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:17,650
We can organise Him!” There are many who
say that, “We don’t believe in God.

279
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,830
We have created this world.

280
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,440
We are the scientists.

281
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,040
We are this."

282
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:32,190
Oh God! In this mad world, thank God He was
not born, otherwise He would have been crucified

283
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,210
much earlier.

284
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:50,340
So, was is impossible to convince at the time
that He was Son of God, but today we can prove

285
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,590
it! Because at that time human beings had
not reached that stage that they could be

286
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,590
given Realisation.

287
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,830
Today, Realisation is working en-masse.

288
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:11,460
Even in England we have now quite a lot of
people: “Even in England,” and I say.

289
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,850
England itself is really a great country.

290
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,370
It’s the heart of the universe.

291
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:23,540
It’s the greatest country, as far as the
articulation is concerned.

292
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:33,179
And the source of all that is good comes from
this country.

293
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:40,110
But the people, English people, have lost
their self-esteem completely I feel sometimes,

294
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,790
the way they copy French and Americans and
things like that.

295
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:54,190
If they could have their self-esteem, I still
say that the English youth are the best in

296
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,450
the whole world.

297
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:02,040
Surprisingly in my own experience I found
that they are the best.

298
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:09,470
But rather difficult nuts to be cracked! If
they are cracked they are the best.

299
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:15,590
And once they are there they sort it out because
they understand.

300
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,470
They are very scholarly.

301
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:26,050
I think by temperament that they understand
when I say, “You cannot pay money for that."

302
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:31,160
You cannot organise God, and something has
to happen within you.

303
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,370
Some actualisation has to take place.

304
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:39,520
This is what you should understand if you
are really an Englishman.

305
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:49,890
Because anything stupid and illogical should
be shunned completely.

306
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:55,419
Now what is the transformation takes place
[is] that, when this Kundalini rises, She

307
00:27:55,419 --> 00:28:01,190
passes through these different centres which
are already exhausted within us.

308
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:15,190
For example the second centre that is within
us is the centre for our activity.

309
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:24,200
Supposing, you think too much, your brains
cells are to be replaced.

310
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:35,960
This poor little centre has to work very hard
to replace those cells in your brain.

311
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,450
It starts working a bit too hard and neglects
all other duties it has to do.

312
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:51,410
For example, it has to look after the liver,
the spleen, the pancreas, the kidneys and

313
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,140
the uterus.

314
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:03,230
But when people indiscriminately just go on
thinking like mad — even thinking about

315
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,220
God — what is it?

316
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,510
It’s like, as I told you, not coming to
Newbury and just thinking about it.

317
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,090
It’s that mad.

318
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:28,530
Then this centre it gets so tired, and so
tired, it’s so exhausted that diseases like

319
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:40,740
diabetes, liver and other complications, even
[the] blood centre of this spleen can be so

320
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,550
crazy with this kind of activity that one
can develop blood cancer.

321
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:51,880
For example, now we are supposed to be running
a rat race.

322
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,210
I mean we are supposed to be.

323
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,360
We are in a race somehow.

324
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,140
Everybody is in a race.

325
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:04,320
Whether it is in the modern race or in any
other race: we have to belong to a cult or

326
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,590
some sort of a group where everybody is running
a race, you see.

327
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:17,870
In that racing we forget about the way we
eat our food, then we rush about.

328
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:28,010
We don’t even give rest to our different
organs as it is required to balance its activities,

329
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:40,590
[so] what happens that a thing like spleen
get so upset, it’s so upset, that it does

330
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,690
not know when to create more blood cells and
when not to create.

331
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:49,049
You are eating your food suddenly a telephone
call comes in, you have to get the telephone.

332
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,540
There’s a little child crying, you are looking
after the child.

333
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:57,169
Now you have to go to the office just leave
your food halfway or whatever you have eaten

334
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:58,559
and you just rush out.

335
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,690
You run to the bus and the bus is missing
so you run to another bus.

336
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:10,930
All this madness make this poor spleen really
mad because it does not understand what to

337
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:20,580
do, how to supply the new blood cells, and
the result is you develop blood cancer.

338
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,299
It’s a very simple reason why people develop
blood cancer.

339
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:31,400
And then blood cancer we say is curable through
Sahaja Yoga.

340
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,390
It is.

341
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:40,010
Actually cancer does not settle in to people
who are realised.

342
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,120
But it’s absolutely curable through Sahaj
Yoga.

343
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,151
All kinds of cancers can be cured through
Sahaj Yoga, no doubt, but we are not here

344
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:52,480
to cure people.

345
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:01,420
Only those who are seekers the Divine is interested
in.

346
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:10,570
You will be surprised, a very rich man, I
would say one of the wealthiest men from India,

347
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:19,080
brought somebody to be cured and I said, “I
am sorry Sir, I cannot cure this person."

348
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,000
And he said, “Why not?

349
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,250
If you cure I’ll build a hospital for you,
I can give an Ashram for you."

350
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:34,640
I said, “You may do whatever you like, but
I am sorry he cannot be cured."

351
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,160
I did not tell him the reason for that, but
the reason is this: this man has exploited

352
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,630
many people, he’s tortured his wife, he’s
tortured his children.

353
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,990
He’s a horrible fellow.

354
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:53,730
He has never sought anything good.

355
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,890
He has no compassion.

356
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,460
He has no love.

357
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,360
He’s for himself, a very selfish and a tyrannical
person.

358
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,450
Tomorrow if Hitler comes and say, “Mother,
you give me Realisation."

359
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,850
Do you think Divine is supposed to give him
Realisation, because he thinks no end of himself?

360
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:17,850
It is for the Divine to decide for you.

361
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,169
It is not for you to decide for the Divine.

362
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,309
The Divine has to say that you are all right.

363
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,730
It’s just the other way round.

364
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,200
Because you may do whatever you like.

365
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:40,610
You may think that you must get all the blessings
from God, but God has to know that whether

366
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,950
He is going to be gracious on you or not.

367
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,590
Even His anger is His graciousness.

368
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:54,160
Because that is what you deserve and through
His anger and wrath He is going to cure you

369
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,730
and improve you.

370
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,620
Sometimes we have wrong ideas also about our
seeking.

371
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:08,250
The seeking comes to us from the third centre
which is in the navel.

372
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,629
We call as ‘Nabhi Chakra’.

373
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:14,179
Is the navel point.

374
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,630
But it’s all in the spinal cord.

375
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:26,280
Now this third centre is the centre which
gives us seeking from the very beginning when

376
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,700
we were amoeba.

377
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:36,629
We started seeking food then, as we became
higher and higher and higher in our seeking

378
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:46,669
of food, we became human beings, then we started
seeking say, money, position, power, fame.

379
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:57,490
Then the spiritual seeking came: we started
seeking in religions outside us, organising

380
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:05,609
religions, calling God, devotion, dedication,
but nothing worked out.

381
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:09,610
So we started a deeper seeking, meditating.

382
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:17,910
At this time also, people came down from all
over the world to teach you meditation.

383
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:27,060
Now meditation cannot be taught, it’s a
happening, when you are in meditation.

384
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:35,920
You cannot go to meditation: it’s not like
a small little house or a temple or a building

385
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,800
where you can enter into.

386
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,750
It’s a happening.

387
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,300
You are pushed into it.

388
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,790
You just become in meditation.

389
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:57,580
And this happening take place only when this
Kundalini pierces this fontanel bone area

390
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,859
and you get an actual baptism — actual,
not artificial.

391
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:13,609
You can see with your naked eyes, the pulsation
of this Kundalini, the rising of this Kundalini

392
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:21,849
and also the pulsation on the head here, till
it stops and you start feeling the cool breeze

393
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,880
coming simultaneously.

394
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,980
That should happen to you; otherwise don’t
believe in any tall stories.

395
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,270
For which you cannot pay.

396
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:43,300
For which you cannot think.

397
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,830
For which you cannot organise.

398
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,810
You cannot put in any effort.

399
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:54,050
It has to happen spontaneously.

400
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,790
So the question comes in: how?

401
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,200
How it happens?

402
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,810
It’s all in, in there.

403
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,920
It’s your own, within yourself.

404
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:17,020
But say there’s a light, say this is a candle
which has got a wick which has got a wax,

405
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,710
it’s just ready to be enlightened.

406
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,250
Then what you do?

407
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:30,240
You take one enlightened candle and bring
it nearer the other and you get the results,

408
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
finished.

409
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,030
What do you do?

410
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:44,120
The enlightened candle just acts as a catalytic
agent, and enlightens the another candle without

411
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,200
any effort, without any trouble.

412
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:54,430
In the same way an enlightened person can
enlighten another person.

413
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,880
It’s very simple.

414
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,470
But that person has to be enlightened.

415
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:13,880
And the enlightened person must know how to
maintain your enlightenment for the time being.

416
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:22,560
Like a seed you sprout: now the children may
sprout the seeds and they would not know what

417
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
do with it.

418
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:33,150
But a gardener knows: which sprouts the seed,
then it takes all the saplings separately,

419
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:43,690
looks after it, allows it to grow, then again
puts it in the soil properly, watches for

420
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:48,200
its growth till it comes to its maturity.

421
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,430
He looks after it.

422
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:55,970
In the same way the person who enlightened
should be able to guide you up to that point.

423
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:04,230
Such a person is called as ‘guru’ in Sanskrit
language but he has to be a guru who should

424
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,230
be able to raise your Kundalini.

425
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,750
Because these days if you say the name of
‘guru’, horrible names and horrible faces

426
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,960
start coming before me and they are not gurus
they are just like satanic forces.

427
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,080
They are horrible people.

428
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:28,150
How can they be a guru, those who live on
your money: parasites of the worst type! You

429
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,200
should see that.

430
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,690
I mean, if I ask you come and live with me,
for no money at all, will you accept such

431
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,120
a situation?

432
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,140
And these are even worse.

433
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,710
And much worse than any dog, I would say.

434
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:51,920
Even the dog eats food at your house at least
looks after your house! This is only one way

435
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
traffic.

436
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:01,020
You have to go on giving them money, money,
money, money, becoming poorer and poorer and

437
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,550
what do you get?

438
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,360
Nothing! You must see their lifestyle, it’s
absurd.

439
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:17,220
They live on your money, they have all the
weaknesses that a scoundrel can have and after

440
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,270
few years you find they’ll land up in the
prison.

441
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,580
Already we have problems with the prison.

442
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,590
So don’t allow any of those gurus come down
here.

443
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,280
Where will you put them?

444
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,080
Like in Switzerland I went and saw one gentleman
there.

445
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,690
He told me that, “There’s a horrible guru
who lives here.

446
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,710
Mother please come and just pay attention
to his ashram."

447
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,160
I said, “All right."

448
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,710
I went with him in his car, and looked at
the place: a huge lavish place he has created

449
00:40:49,710 --> 00:41:00,350
for himself, with very tall walls like a big
palace! And you could see from outside the

450
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,369
amount of money this fellow must have gathered.

451
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:15,090
And within eight days a nurse fell in love
with a policeman, and this nurse was the private

452
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:27,230
secretary of this guru who had used that nurse
to poison some oranges to kill some people.

453
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:35,160
And so the guru, the great, now is in jail
for 14 years.

454
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:44,160
All such horrid people what have they got
to do with Divine?

455
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,880
But they mesmerise, and once you are mesmerised
your seeking becomes absolutely stupid and

456
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
foolish.

457
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,790
You cannot see you are mesmerised.

458
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,220
You cannot understand how you are mesmerised.

459
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,790
You don’t want anything for yourself.

460
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:07,490
There’s another one who was coming here
the other day, and he said that, “If you

461
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,480
give me a Rolls Royce I’ll come."

462
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,849
Imagine! He was to come from America.

463
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:21,690
He had already got 58 Rolls Royce from you
people, from you, the English, very wise.

464
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:28,410
I must say the wisest people in the whole
world, have given 58 Rolls Royces to this

465
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:35,710
14 year old fellow! Now he has become yankee
in America, taken away all your money, befooling

466
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,710
you.

467
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,859
He has 58 Rolls Royces, he wants 59th.

468
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:41,680
I don’t know why he wants one more.

469
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,050
Poor boys and girls, they don’t have so
much money now.

470
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,109
Here the young people don’t have much money.

471
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:55,570
Like in our country maybe rich people’s
children get a lot of money, but here I find

472
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,020
that the young people have to find their own
way.

473
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:04,780
They starved themselves, ate only potatoes
and fasted, did all kinds of things to save

474
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:14,099
money to buy a Rolls Royce for this scoundrel,
just think of it! These are all seekers who

475
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,099
did it.

476
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:24,060
So foolish and stupid! And when he came they
presented him with this Rolls Royce.

477
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,480
My heart really weeps and I really don’t
know what to say to this kind of foolishness

478
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
people are doing.

479
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:38,270
Naturally your parents do not believe in you!
They think: what stupidity you are doing?

480
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,060
I can understand.

481
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,910
Even if they doubt me, I wouldn’t mind,
because really this kind of stupidity you

482
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,280
have done.

483
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,520
And how can you believe such stupid fellow
who asked for a Rolls Royce?

484
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,790
You should have really given him a toy Rolls
Royce and 3, 4 slaps on the face and he would

485
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,790
gone back.

486
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,610
That’s what he deserves.

487
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:04,440
Now he got this Rolls Royce very nicely, he
cheated you all and went back.

488
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:12,400
And he’ll come back next year and you will
be again doing the same thing for him!

489
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,290
Now when some of the Sahaja Yogis went and
asked these people that, “Why did you do

490
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,680
it?” They said, “He has given us something
so great.

491
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,970
This is metal.

492
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:29,320
If we give him the metal and if he gives us
the Spirit why not do it?” It’s foolishness!

493
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,181
Can you get Spirit for giving some metal?

494
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:34,181
Can you?

495
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:41,050
Spirit, can you purchase it or could exchange
it?

496
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:50,470
But 
from where this kind of stupidity walks into

497
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,470
your heads?

498
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,010
I mean you are not such stupid people.

499
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,060
Most of them are educated in university: Oxford,
Cambridge.

500
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:00,070
Did you learn all these stupidity there?

501
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,390
No! It’s some sort of a mesmerism I feel.

502
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,690
Some stupid spirits have entered into their
minds.

503
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,370
That’s the only solution I can get.

504
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:18,880
I cannot understand what is the reason for
these people to go about buying Rolls Royces

505
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,600
for their gurus.

506
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,109
Then another guru comes up here and tells
you, “I will make you fly."

507
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:29,190
Very big, big people are out to fly.

508
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,360
But why do you want to fly?

509
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,580
Do you want to become birds?

510
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,830
Have you to become birds now?

511
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:46,480
You have to become a superior human being,
with superior value systems, built within

512
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
you.

513
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,880
You want to fly.

514
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,290
I mean it is stupidity.

515
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:57,180
Even if somebody gives you ideas like that,
better ask him to fly himself, drop him from

516
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:03,690
this leaning tower of Pisa and see where does
he lie, which part.

517
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,470
Why do you believe such stupid things, I can’t
understand.

518
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,130
You are supposed to be English.

519
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,130
I mean at least Indians have great ideas about
your brains.

520
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,130
H.

521
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,130
G.

522
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,590
Wells has said that English will have one
day having only heads and no bodies.

523
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,099
But I don’t think that’s going to happen
with the advent of all these stupid gurus

524
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,599
coming here and you people passing out all
your money to them.

525
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,220
I don’t know what is going to happen.

526
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:35,240
As it is we are suffering from so many other
things, plus this kind of a nonsense coming

527
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,330
all the spirits coming down.

528
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:43,510
All this negativity working into us I don’t
know what is going to happen to this country

529
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,510
of ours.

530
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,510
I don’t know.

531
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,770
I can’t understand.

532
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:52,650
Now everybody is meditating in this country,
trying to fly.

533
00:46:52,650 --> 00:47:01,330
Imagine! Doing nothing, sitting at home, meditating:
lethargy of the worst type! Trying to fly.

534
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,210
This is what it is.

535
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,560
That’s what has happened to our seeking
in various ways, in this way or that way or

536
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,560
that way.

537
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,920
No, this is not to happen anymore, enough
of it.

538
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,290
You must get your Realisation.

539
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,440
That’s what you have to have.

540
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,950
The Kundalini has to rise and you have to
get it because you are seekers of ages, ancient

541
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:24,950
times.

542
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,760
You are born today, here, to get your Realisation.

543
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,000
That’s your right to have it, and not to
be befooled by these people who just come

544
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,880
here and exploit you and have floated a market
and enterprises.

545
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,080
Now this Kundalinis thing comes to you through
that centre.

546
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:53,630
When it comes to awakening centre, that centre
of your seeking.

547
00:47:53,630 --> 00:48:01,560
Then you start seeing what you are seeking.

548
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:09,690
You are seeking the joy of your Spirit, the
bliss of peace within yourself.

549
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:22,630
When the Kundalini rises and shoots off, the
seeking is complete because you have found

550
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:28,310
it: you are just there, no questions.

551
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:33,350
Supposing you enlighten the light then what
does the light do?

552
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,900
First, she is asking for the light, all right,
“I must have the light.

553
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,910
I must have the light,” [then] she gives
light — finished.

554
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:46,440
Then you don’t sit there, you sit here with
me and you give vibrations to people, you

555
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,330
raise their Kundalinis, you awaken them and
give them Realisation.

556
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,500
Yes, it happens.

557
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,740
You all have those powers.

558
00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:01,530
In a split of a second you get that and you
become that.

559
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:06,760
That’s your style [because] you are human
beings, you are not worms.

560
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:19,250
You are created out of the billions and billions
of creatures, special ones, the chosen ones,

561
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:27,930
to bestow this bliss upon you so that you
enter into the Kingdom of your Father, the

562
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:34,550
God Almighty, and enjoy your being and that’s
what you are.

563
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,180
Why are you wasting and frittering away your
energy on these nonsensical people?

564
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,789
Pay attention to yourself.

565
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:43,280
Just find out what you are.

566
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,290
It’s a very easy thing: it should happen
to you.

567
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:53,820
It has happened to so many in this country
and should happen to people in Newbury.

568
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,329
It is Cathy who has brought me here.

569
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:07,520
Actually now I am on my way to India and you
had this idea not to go out of London, because

570
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,720
I have really travelling too much in Europe.

571
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,119
Of course, I must say Europeans are also very
sensible people: they can see through now.

572
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:17,170
But I think you have to go through all that
otherwise you would have never understood

573
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,490
the value of Sahaj Yoga.

574
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:25,980
Perhaps that was necessary for them to spend
a lot of money on these gurus and to suffer

575
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,170
from all kinds of diseases.

576
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:33,030
There are some here sitting, from there only
suffering from epilepsy and all kinds of horrible

577
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,030
diseases like blood cancer.

578
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,030
They are here, some of them sitting.

579
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:43,250
Then you will realise the value of Sahaja
Yoga which gives you bliss, joy and happiness.

580
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:48,540
First of all it gives you the physical well
being.

581
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,849
It just gives you the physical well being.

582
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:58,560
Like any place where God has to be brought
in, you clean that place.

583
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,890
So the Kundalini cleanses your physical being.

584
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,690
That’s how you get your diseases cured.

585
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:12,890
Cancer is very simple, extremely simple, to
be cured, very simple to be cured.

586
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:19,481
But for doctors it is impossible to accept
that there is God, in the real sense of the

587
00:51:19,481 --> 00:51:20,481
word.

588
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:22,099
Ah, they will have a photograph of Christ
in the house.

589
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:25,820
They might wear a cross, you see, that’s
at the most.

590
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:37,420
But to believe that you can cure cancer through
Divine power is an impossibility for them.

591
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,970
But we have some doctors also here.

592
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,900
But if they come to me they think they are
all mad.

593
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,150
Cancer is a simple disease.

594
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:50,440
Now they have reached a point where they are
coming nearer to Sahaj Yoga.

595
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:59,270
On the left hand side and the right hand side
we have certain areas, and now they are talking

596
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:04,960
about these areas which exist within us and
they say there is an attack from these areas

597
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:15,780
which are built within us from the time of
our creation, and these areas have those deposits

598
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:24,340
and they send forth some protein matter, which
we cannot identify otherwise, which might

599
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,119
have gone out of circulation of evolution.

600
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:31,359
When they attack us cancer is triggered.

601
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,320
And now this I have said at least ten years
back.

602
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,150
I have been saying that there are entities
who enter into us.

603
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:46,920
’Us’ meaning the central path, the middle
path, the middle road.

604
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,260
They come from the sides and attack us.

605
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:56,910
But actually when we go to the extremes of
the left or to the right, we ourselves become

606
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:01,980
vulnerable and we are attacked and that’s
how cancer is set in.

607
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:09,349
So down below is the hell, the left side is
the collective subconscious, the right side

608
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:14,470
is the collective supraconscious, which is
the future side of it.

609
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:22,829
In the top is the Divine Power, which is the
superconsciousness we can call it, or the

610
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:29,609
collective unconscious as they call it, which
becomes conscious as soon as the Kundalini

611
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:30,900
touches it.

612
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:37,290
Your attention goes there and the whole thing
is lifted just like the tent being lifted

613
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:46,250
up, and you find that nothing can enter into
your attention anymore.

614
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,385
You are in that area where you cannot get
attacked.

615
00:53:48,385 --> 00:53:59,369
And this is what has happened to you, to many
of you, and is going to happen to the rest

616
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:03,420
of the people who have come here for the first
time.

617
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:10,700
I must say, Newbury, I must find out about
it much more, because I find this place has

618
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,480
tremendous vibrations.

619
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,070
Only when our car arrived here I asked them,
“Where is the water somewhere here?” I

620
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:22,480
was not dousing but I can feel vibrations
of the water somewhere.

621
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,400
And the place has tremendous vibrations.

622
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:33,060
Actually I was thinking, “How am I going
to speak?” because as soon as I reached

623
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:39,030
this place my whole body started emitting
all kinds of energies from the body and I

624
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:43,700
was really very much worried as to, “What’s
going to happen now?

625
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:50,980
What am I going to speak?” But this has
worked out and I hope you have been able to

626
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,540
understand it.

627
00:54:52,540 --> 00:55:00,010
Now for the rest of the details you just don’t
worry.

628
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:05,050
We have all the books and everything for your
information which you can read later on.

629
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:12,080
It’s is a simple thing, like coming in the
room, you ask me how to put on the lights.

630
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,530
I have to just tell you, “Just press the
switch and it will be on."

631
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,970
In the same way everything is built within
you, you don’t have to do anything about

632
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:22,970
it.

633
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,369
It will work out in no time.

634
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:31,250
But once it is worked out then you [should]
try to understand it, what it is, and try

635
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,569
to maintain it for a while.

636
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:41,460
And you will be amazed that, here in Newbury,
you can start a centre of your own of Sahaj

637
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,570
Yoga, giving Realisation to many people.

638
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,680
May God bless you! Thank you.

639
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:54,390
If you have any questions you can ask me.

640
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,290
Yes, please.

641
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:05,990
Man: Yeah I have got a question okay.

642
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,850
Earlier on you were going on about if you
have family, children, and such as, who interrupt

643
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,220
you and the telephone.

644
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,069
What were you trying to say?

645
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:16,609
Do you want us just ignore this?

646
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:19,890
Shri Mataji: Oh, not at all! If you are not
married you cannot get Realisation.

647
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,650
Man: Then what do you mean by this?

648
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:27,619
I tend to think you are you trying to say
that you must try and ignore household attractions

649
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:28,619
and this…

650
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:32,500
Shri Mataji: When did I say that?

651
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,070
Man: I don’t quite know.

652
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:41,530
I had a job to hear everything you say but…

653
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:46,230
Shri Mataji: No, no, no! Who said that?

654
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,990
Not at all!

655
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:54,430
Man: What did you mean when you say, “The
telephone rings.."

656
00:56:54,430 --> 00:57:04,050
What do you mean, “You must suddenly stop
and answer the telephone,” but what do you

657
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,050
mean?

658
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,710
Yogini: Mother, it’s when you were talking
about the spleen.

659
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,950
You said that the trouble is that there are
so many distractions that the spleen can’t

660
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,190
handle it, and I think he’s misunderstood
you.

661
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,190
Man: Yeah, that’s right.

662
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,640
Shri Mataji: Ah! No, no, no, you should only
look after your child and not the telephone,

663
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
I was meaning.

664
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,640
You must have your priorities properly built
up.

665
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,640
Ours are not.

666
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,520
What I was trying to say a child is lying
there, you are eating your food, a telephone

667
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:28,550
is coming, now you have to rush out, the child
is neglected, you run away, you are worried

668
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,900
about the child — never that [what you were
suggesting].

669
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,130
You don’t know in Sahaja Yoga you have to
be married.

670
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,010
There’s a centre of marriage.

671
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,400
You will be amazed.

672
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,420
If you are a so called ascetic, I can’t
give you Realisation.

673
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,300
Another man: You can’t what?

674
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,849
Shri Mataji: You can’t get your Realisation
if you are an ascetic.

675
00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:48,150
So called.

676
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,180
Asceticism is within yourself.

677
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,869
A person like Guru Nanaka and all these great
people they were all married people.

678
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:59,390
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up
your family at all.

679
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:05,170
On the contrary, we have to have families,
beautiful families and beautiful children

680
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:07,270
and we are having Sahaja Yoga marriages.

681
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:12,150
Do you know there are three or four couples
here who were married through Sahaj Yoga.

682
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,270
And they are beautiful people, they have beautiful
children.

683
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:22,680
And moreover I must tell you a greater news:
that there are lots of realised-souls who

684
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,270
are born in this country.

685
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,760
And you have to be married so that they are
born to you also.

686
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:34,050
Now this child is a realised-soul, she is
sitting, towards me.

687
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:40,140
To be sitting that quietly is not possible
unless and until they are realised.

688
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,140
This Alison is born-realised.

689
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,710
Man: My children, my three children: They
are not realised and they are sitting here

690
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:43,710
all quiet!

691
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:44,710
Shri Mataji: Who?

692
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,869
Man: My children, my 3 children, they are
not realised so you are taking…

693
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:46,869
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

694
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:47,869
Let me see where are they?

695
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:48,869
Man: One, two, three.

696
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:49,980
Shri Mataji: They must be born-realised, I
am sure.

697
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,980
Man: They are not! They are not!

698
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,280
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

699
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,990
How do you know?

700
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,030
We’ll tell them.

701
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:00,760
How do you know?

702
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:08,280
You don’t know, you are not yet realised
but they are, must be I am sure, 100%.

703
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:13,589
Man: Well it seems that anything you say,
goes.

704
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:15,060
Shri Mataji: We’ll teach you how to know.

705
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,060
We’ll teach you how to know.

706
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,060
You should get your Realisation.

707
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,060
Where are they?

708
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,060
I would love to see them.

709
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,060
I can’t see them.

710
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,250
Man: But they are quiet all the time.

711
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,490
I say it’s instinct.

712
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,680
Shri Mataji: Come along, come, come.

713
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,760
They must be born-realised to be quiet like
that.

714
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,760
I would like to see them.

715
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,760
I am sure.

716
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,760
How would you know their value?

717
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,920
I would love to see them.

718
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,950
Oh that, she is realised 100%.

719
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:40,740
Are you doubting her Realisation?

720
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,369
She is born-realised.

721
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:44,619
She is born as a realised-soul.

722
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:46,480
She is born-realised, no doubt.

723
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,570
I mean I knew, I was going to ask about her.

724
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,060
How do you know?

725
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:55,650
You are a great person to have three children
born-realised, I must say.

726
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:59,780
For example, the little one there is a born-realised
and the little in that corner is a born-realised.

727
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,250
And there are many born-realised people, also
there are people who are there.

728
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,670
Where is Alan is he there?

729
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:07,690
Man: It’s just natural it doesn’t need
a big word for it, does it!

730
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:11,570
Shri Mataji: They are born-realised because
they got their Realisation in their previous

731
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,570
lives.

732
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,350
It is a very big thing for people who are
not realised.

733
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,930
Man: What do they know about previous lives?

734
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,180
They don’t know anything about previous
lives.

735
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,560
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am going to tell
them.

736
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,330
That’s why I am here.

737
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,800
They are born because I am here.

738
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,220
Do you know that?

739
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,150
I am going to tell them what it is.

740
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,830
See these, these are all born-realised [those]
two people [who] are coming.

741
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,170
Ask them about it.

742
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:41,410
I never gave them Realisation they are born-realised
but I gave them the knowledge about what they

743
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,410
are.

744
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:46,540
(Sit down my child, sit down.) They are all
realised-souls, no doubt about it! Not [just]

745
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:53,069
realised-souls but they could be very great
souls born on this Earth.

746
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:55,990
It is not [that] they are quiet because they
are told to be.

747
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,990
If they were not realised-souls they would
have run away.

748
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,540
They would not have been sitting because they
are enjoying it.

749
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,869
Their Spirit is enjoying it.

750
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:07,260
You will know it very soon.

751
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,750
Man: They will sit quietly anywhere!

752
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,820
Shri Mataji: No, no, they might because they
are realised-souls.

753
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:15,830
Man: No, it doesn’t mean they are realised-souls,
it just means they are children.

754
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:19,850
Shri Mataji: They are very different types
of children, very different type, something

755
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:20,850
so unique.

756
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:24,620
Once you get your Realisation you will start
seeing their beauty much better.

757
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,080
Oh! They know such a lot you can’t imagine.

758
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,380
My four grandchildren are born-realised but
my own daughters were not.

759
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,550
What am I to do?

760
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:40,040
And four of them are great people, but my
own daughters were not.

761
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,280
What to do?

762
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,720
They are born-realised.

763
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,110
You will see that.

764
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,110
They are that.

765
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,800
You should be a proud man.

766
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,870
But you better get your Realisation, all right.

767
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,780
I am happy you are so concerned about your
children.

768
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,080
I am very happy.

769
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,380
May God bless you.

770
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,380
Any other questions?

771
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:07,910
Seeker: I am very impressed with what you
said about Christ having done thinking for

772
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:13,710
us and we ourselves are trying to think too
much.

773
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:29,510
Isn’t there a danger, if we all become child-like
trusters, that we could be exploited?

774
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:34,140
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is a danger, of course.

775
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,690
I mean you are already exploited 100%.

776
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,310
There is a danger, no doubt.

777
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:41,220
I have already told you about the danger.

778
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,339
But to become child-like is not easy.

779
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:47,859
You can be befooled but to be child-like is
the best thing.

780
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:49,850
Innocence is the most powerful thing.

781
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:56,260
If you are innocent nobody can touch you.

782
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,250
But very difficult to be innocent.

783
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:05,440
The centre of innocence has to be awakened
within us, then you will be like children.

784
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:13,119
Now would you say that Christ was exploited,
many people feel that way that He was exploited:

785
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,050
no! It was all planned very well.

786
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,640
He just played a drama.

787
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,160
Such people do not suffer.

788
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,550
I do not suffer, never.

789
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:25,730
Even if I say that I am suffering it’s just
a joke.

790
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,810
Never take that seriously.

791
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,640
It’s a drama.

792
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,079
Such people don’t suffer.

793
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,670
He never suffered, in the sense you understand
suffering.

794
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:41,069
Of course, with the physical body you do feel
little pain here and there.

795
01:03:41,069 --> 01:03:48,869
But you just see it as a witness.

796
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:50,990
You are not really in it.

797
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:57,099
And when you become that, yourself, a witness,
nobody can exploit you.

798
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:03,780
Because what happens you develop a new type
of a dimension, an awareness, which is called

799
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,780
as vibratory awareness.

800
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:09,570
By this enlightenment of your fingers you
become collectively conscious.

801
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:16,619
Immediately you know who is who, what is what.

802
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,450
Children know it, those who are realised-souls
specially know it.

803
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,650
Any funny man comes in they start crying and
weeping.

804
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,180
Like this girl’s father and mother were
involved in a nonsense.

805
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,490
They are here now.

806
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:34,260
Both suffered a lot the mother became epileptic
and all that.

807
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:41,869
And this child used to scream whenever she
saw their revered guru, and she used to shout

808
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:45,880
and resist and she used to kick him.

809
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,320
She is just a child but she knew how to protect.

810
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:55,820
And these people with all their intelligence
and education and this and that, were absolutely

811
01:04:55,820 --> 01:05:00,970
useless! Because you develop that new awareness
within you by which you can feel a person,

812
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:01,970
you know.

813
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:02,970
You cannot be exploited.

814
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:03,970
All right.

815
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:11,250
That has to happen to you.

816
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,950
That’s a happening.

817
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:19,450
Such a powerful personality develops, such
a powerful personality.

818
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:25,940
That way, many of our Sahaj Yogis also think
that I am a quite an innocent person, I mean

819
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,940
they think so, but now they know I know everything.

820
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:35,089
I may look such a fool, but I am not.

821
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:43,870
And the powerfulness is such, that first the
compassion, the compassion itself is so powerful,

822
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:46,320
so engulfing, it’s so rewarding.

823
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,460
Then you are not bothered about anyone.

824
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,140
What are they going to do to you?

825
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:58,150
Like in India when I started, right and left
criticising, all these gurus, taking their

826
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,150
names.

827
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,250
I started saying, “Now these people are
like this.

828
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,540
These people, they are making money and befooling
you."

829
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:11,369
Some of the guru’s people, who were [become]
Sahaja Yogis, one of them was some Raja or

830
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:15,359
some place, he came to me and said, “Mother,
what are you doing?

831
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,359
They will kill You."

832
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:21,440
I said, “This time let them try killing
me! Who is going to kill me, I’ll see?

833
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,950
That was done once for all.

834
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:27,470
Now let me see who is going to kill me."

835
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:32,070
I said, “Let them lift their hands towards
me, if they can they’ll shake.

836
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,740
They cannot kill me."

837
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:41,530
It’s the most powerful thing is your innocence
which we have lost sometimes foolishly.

838
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,440
It is the highest thing.

839
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:50,150
And nobody can exploit an innocent person,
nobody can befool.

840
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:55,690
You have seen simple village folk, how do
they exist with all the cunning of the very

841
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,250
well educated and sophisticated people, how
do they exist?

842
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:10,710
They can manage them just like this (clicks
Her fingers) And you must see the intentions

843
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:23,310
of the person: why a person should exploit,
what is the need of the person.

844
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:27,390
People don’t even see the credibility of
a personality who comes here.

845
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:28,420
It’s very surprising.

846
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,140
Like one guru came here.

847
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:38,460
I would say, it’s something, another foolishness
who was living in a tin shed, that is what

848
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:47,730
Peter told me in South Africa, and thousands
and thousands of people are his disciples.

849
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,730
To such an extent you will be surprised.

850
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,150
I mean, I don’t know what to say, this is
complete blindness.

851
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:56,390
I went to Norwich, so far away.

852
01:07:56,390 --> 01:08:00,640
This fellow has come to London only.

853
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:09,310
And I met three elderly ladies who were his
disciples and this gentleman was later on

854
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:17,750
found to be having whisky every night and
using women, and he had all kinds of things.

855
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:24,210
And his private secretary herself disclosed
everything about him.

856
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:25,923
And then they found it out and they verified
it.

857
01:08:25,923 --> 01:08:27,319
But these three foolish women still said,
“Whatever it is Mother we cannot give him

858
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:28,359
up, we love him."

859
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:30,830
Now what to do to with such stupid women?

860
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,780
You just tell me.

861
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:48,110
I mean the question of you also wanting to
get exploited! I mean he is exposed, everybody

862
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:56,150
knows about it, this gentleman about whom
I told you who was asking for a Rolls Royce,

863
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,430
was caught for smuggling three hundred watches
in India.

864
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:03,949
I mean how can a man like that be interested
in smuggling?

865
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:12,910
Just think of that! But all these people who
carried those watches went to the police and

866
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:17,589
said, “We brought it for ourselves."

867
01:09:17,589 --> 01:09:22,580
Three hundred watches this fellow was carrying!
And they would not give in.

868
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:29,970
And when he went to jail, they put a big show,
and the Indian government did not know what

869
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:33,530
to do so they said, “All right you take
him away.

870
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:39,310
We don’t want to keep him in jail that otherwise
your government will come and say why our

871
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:45,680
three hundred Britishers are arrested,”
imagine! So they sent all the bad lock, stock

872
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,819
and barrel back.

873
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:49,009
So he came back here.

874
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:52,089
From here he has gone to America.

875
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:58,199
Now if you don’t want to see: I mean, isn’t
it clear cut what I said?

876
01:09:58,199 --> 01:09:59,699
So clear cut.

877
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:02,560
If you don’t want to see it what can you
do?

878
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,190
I mean I tell you, sometimes I feel it is
the people who want to get exploited or they

879
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,570
don’t want to see it.

880
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:14,340
Now I would like one of them to speak to you
it would be a good idea.

881
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:19,240
Because you will know how he was caught and
how he was disillusioned.

882
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,240
Peter (Pierce)?

883
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,890
Is he there, just tell him.

884
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:26,230
So you will know how he was befooled.

885
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:35,580
He was supposed to be a great, he is, he was,
a great diamond merchant from South Africa;

886
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:42,460
married a granddaughter of a Duke of your
country, and that the granddaughter is also

887
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,460
here.

888
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,460
Peter?

889
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:45,590
Where is he?

890
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:46,670
Peter?

891
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:50,070
I would like you to tell them what happened
with you and how you got exploited.

892
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,070
That would be a better idea.

893
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,070
You have it from your own kith and kin.

894
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,070
Just tell them.

895
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:54,070
(End of Amruta recording)

896
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:57,239
Shri Mataji: No, but the question is like
this you were out, I must ask you the question

897
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:58,239
is that, “Why did you get exploited like
that?

898
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,239
What happened actually, what happened to you
people that you accept this kind of a situation,

899
01:10:59,239 --> 01:10:59,248
is the point, isn’t it?” Ah! That’s
the question.
