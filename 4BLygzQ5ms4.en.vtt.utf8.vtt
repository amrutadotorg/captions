00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.609
It would be better if you are

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.290
All right

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.409
We are here we all understand English do you all the people who are reporters English?

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.229
We are here

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.409
To inform you about

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.399
a power

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.580
Which is within us?

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.399
and the power that

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:05.399
Can give you what is promised by all the same scriptures and all the incarnations

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.499
Today when you see the young people in every country specially in the West

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.939
You'll find they are not satisfied

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.439
With their own atmosphere

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.190
Their lives

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.009
And they think there is something missing

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.779
And they are extremely confused

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.219
Now when they are confused

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.359
They are seeking for something beyond

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200
Something unknown to them

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.379
In that seeking they may take to anything extreme

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.259
Drugs could be alcoholism

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.070
Or some other perversions, which cause horrible diseases incurable diseases

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.340
Instead of condemning them

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.479
We have to see why they are doing all these things

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.560
What is the purpose

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.829
Also some of them went to some gurus

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.639
Which are in the market

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.149
Especially when they see the religious people and the religions

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:40.189
They cannot believe that religion can give such horrid experiences

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.710
And some of them are anti-god anti-religion also

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.719
But if you deal with the problem sympathetically you cannot blame them because they are intelligent

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.319
Aware people

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.800
So now we have to category of people one the ones who are not seeking at all

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.979
And another are the once

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.370
Who want to find out solutions of the problems

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.379
In every generation

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:10.529
We had people who revolutionized

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:19.199
Because they did not like a particular system or did not like a particular style of life, whatever it was

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.619
But now the revolution has to come from within

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.139
We have to evolve from within

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.150
Because the destruction is also coming from within

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.129
We are destroying ourselves more from within

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.620
Because we are so unhappy so confused

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.699
Absolutely quite a percentage is schizophrenic

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.310
So then we start seeking this solution

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.859
And in that seeking we make mistakes

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:35.449
And we make mistakes because we do not know what to seek

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:44.849
And how to find

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.309
Also how to evolve to that state

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.049
So logically we have to reach

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.440
some conclusions logically

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.339
That it has to be some

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.720
evolutionary

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.430
happening

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.430
This is logical to

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.449
transform ourselves

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:22.989
There has to be some evolution

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.360
You was not an Austrian magic

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.210
Freud was invited

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.890
All right, so like you have said that

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.220
You have to become

00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:55.859
Collectively conscious you have to become it's an actualization. It is not just a certificate

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.029
It has to be come from within it's an honest thing

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.589
It's an innate thing

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:04.589
It is not just a preaching

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:09.329
Or sort of a giving a certificate it is not or taking a name

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.759
It is actualization within yourself so

00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:21.779
That something has to happen to us

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.130
Now as we have evolved from monkey stage to this stage for example

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.930
You've done nothing it is a living process

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.709
Which has taken place spontaneously

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.490
There's a big resistance

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.830
To any

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.350
Oriental ideas

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.350
being accepted in the West

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.930
wick resistance I

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.189
Find there's a very big resistance for any oriental ideas

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.320
Coming to the West

00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:41.688
Now these oriental ideas which are coming

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.689
Are to be seen with a scientific open mind

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.619
Because the Western life has grown like a tree outside

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.239
But the roots may be in the East

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:20.010
Maybe we can keep ourselves open to see we're at the roots

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.280
Now if the roots are in the East supposing it's an hypothesis

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.190
So let us have a look at it. If there is any solution in those

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.169
So you go to oriental, I guess

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.699
But there also, it's very dangerous

00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:00.919
Because you are going in the unknown you might go to false guru. You might go to wrong people

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.100
And get completely destroyed

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.140
So

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.090
What do we do?

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.759
First thing we should know we cannot pay for our evolution

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.029
We cannot pay money is not there

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.609
Nor can we pay for any living process any living process we cannot be

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:48.479
Like if the seat has to sprout the mother earth is sprouted we don't pay the mother earth

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:57.450
All right so first thing they should have known that anybody who asks for money

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:04.199
Is not a truthful person no money should be known

00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:14.279
Then the second point comes in that we got to this stage of human awareness

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.120
Spontaneously

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.350
Without any effort effortlessly

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.280
In the same way it should happen

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.410
But first of all in every evolution there has been one leader

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.130
We can call them as archetypes as they say or whatever you may say want to say

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:04.029
So you was not very clear on that point

00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:11.559
So now such a person can decode

00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:14.829
the information

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:16.910
Of

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.480
symbols and everything and

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.630
Can help others without taking any money without taking any gratification?

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:31.779
Can do it and here it is

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.699
That people fumble in the West

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.060
They don't mind a pope

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:42.849
They don't mind an RPF of canterbury

00:14:43.819 --> 00:14:48.939
But they do mind a person who is doing everything free just out of love

00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:04.289
You'd be amazed in England the television people told me that we cannot accept anything which does not take money

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.149
Can you believe it he's a fact

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:19.019
In I think in Boston or somewhere they asked me a question how many Rolls Royces you have got

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.190
This is

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.479
And in San Francisco, they would not even publish my advertisement

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.799
Because by mistakes we had said that it can cure AIDS

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:42.089
They said no we don't want AIDS to be cured. We don't want anything to deal with our homosexuality

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.379
They said that horrible things that

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.470
65 percent people are

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.510
homosexuals in San Francisco and

00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:54.389
the editor if he's a homosexual

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.040
and the

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.430
Chairman is even the Mary's

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.430
so I didn't know what to do I

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.510
Thought it better not to advertise because we will be useless for them

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.620
This is the problem is

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:17.190
Then the most important thing which is not realized by modern mind

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.429
That they believe anything new is to be tried

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.970
Is a very dangerous thing

00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:49.249
If we are dealing with the living process of evolution we have to know

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.519
That

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:54.810
in

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.490
spiritual life

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.490
Whatever is going to happen

00:16:58.769 --> 00:17:03.709
Must relate to scriptures to all the Scriptures must relate

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:28.299
Not to one scripture say for Holy Bible or Holy Quran or any but to all of them

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.050
Because it is like a seed that

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.790
sprouts

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.790
Then it becomes

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.990
the stem

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.990
then the branches

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.390
then the leaves

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:53.230
Then the flower and then the fruit living process it is based on something

00:17:54.950 --> 00:18:02.200
Evolves through something, but whatever is dead like we can create a fruit plastic fruit from nowhere. Just like that is you

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.470
So which has no basis?

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:19.620
Has no meaning it must have a basis from where it has come its origin must be seen

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.600
As in the growth of the

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.900
tree

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.219
all that is useless drops out in the same way in evolution also all that is useless drops are

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.569
Even useless tradition drop out everything drops out but ultimately

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.179
You reach to the epitome

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.490
Where you become the fruit?

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:07.270
So the time has come for human beings to become the spirit

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.750
What's the white cotton

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.669
Fabric

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.949
So every seed has memory alright and

00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:43.739
In the same way within us is our Camry is the Kundalini

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.520
And this is to be actually awakened actually awakened

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:20.749
Of course the superficial people who are not worried about the world will not bother about

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.610
Their out of question superficial people, but there are another kind

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.879
Who is making money in the name of?

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.060
spirit

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:36.379
Or living on that money and organizing

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.190
We'll definitely oppose us

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:52.589
Naturally we become controversial for them because the basically we'll use them

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.709
For no fault of ours we don't mean too much it just happens along

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.940
But a person who has

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.600
Pure intelligence

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.010
You need not be a very well-educated person nothing but pure intelligence can see through the game

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:18.209
Should be able to see through the game

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.800
Now in sahaja yoga, we have

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.470
thousands of people all over the world

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.180
There are people who are we can call them the highest in the society?

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.739
There are people who are the lowest in the so-called society?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.920
all of them are

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:58.409
At par with each and every person there is no higher lower feeling

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:06.479
Everyone belongs to that society and so it belongs to that society

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.870
Moreover

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.870
when this happens

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.420
Because we understand

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.749
What these incarnations where?

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.800
The conflict of

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.930
All religions drops out like that

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.310
We understand it on central nervous system the conflict drops out

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.050
There is no question of not worshiping Christ

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.169
Muslims Jews Hindus

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.810
all worship Christ

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:48.299
They all worship Muhammad SAW, and they all worship Rama, Krishna

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.370
Because

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.370
Actually, they see that

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.290
when the Kundalini Rises she passes through certain centers and

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.969
There you have to take the name of those great

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.260
incarnations

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.650
so this is the knowledge of the roots and

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.699
one must know that you have to become a subtler being

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.460
to understand that knowledge

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.759
But unless and until we have that knowledge

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:26.969
We are in for a catastrophic there's a big shock awaiting us

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.660
And how are we going to avert it?

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.580
Just by talking about peace you don't bring peace

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.370
Those who talk about peace they don't have peace within themselves

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.469
So we are at that point we try

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.749
To talk about tell about it persuade people

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.449
And media can help us it has helped us a lot in Italy

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:27.100
And also in India of course because in India people know they have the knowledge of the route

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.370
So it's very easy in the villages of India

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.610
Even in the cities of India's we are

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.870
Doing very well not only that but

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.749
say for example Delhi University has accepted sahaja yoga for research and

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.130
The degree you get is a Doctor of Medicine higher than post graduation after post graduation

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.519
You get this degree is very rare Doctor of Medicine

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:01.929
For sahaja yoga, they have accepted even Cambridge University has accepted this for a result

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.500
So once you try to see the sense in it

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.329
Not they have not done it to criticize him, but with respect

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.809
Not to criticize it but with respect with acceptance that there is something about

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:28.728
So I would request the media to give the facts

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.429
By understanding it you have nothing to gain

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.979
But

00:25:37.979 --> 00:25:40.969
Austrian people should be benefited. That's all

00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:46.849
As a result of Kundalini awakening it can claim many things

00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:50.358
But that can be seen that

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.539
Cancer can be cured so many incurable physical diseases can be cured

00:25:57.899 --> 00:25:59.899
mental diseases can be cured

00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:02.869
Drug addiction can be cured

00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:06.529
The problems created

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:10.789
By these gurus can be cured

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.439
All these things can be done when you become the spirit

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.889
But this should be just at a level

00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:24.919
of a hypothesis

00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:29.358
When we do it, and it's proof, then you should accept not blindly

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:31.999
There is no blind faith in sahaja, yoga

00:26:35.489 --> 00:26:39.049
We have no priest roots nobody is paid

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.820
It's a free society

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:57.160
And everyone becomes very knowledgeable

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.880
A sahaja yogi, may not be a doctor, but he can cure people

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.709
He may not be a sec artist, but he can keep your mad people

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.730
He becomes equipped

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.579
With the power by which he does it

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.370
like Christ was not a

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.420
doctor

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.420
Sure people in

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.050
The same way in the same fashion

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:43.319
Now I would like you to ask me questions because it's a very wide subject and one can go on talking about it

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:50.100
I wanted these people to explain to you for 15 minutes all other things so that you will have your questions ready for me

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:22.428
Any other you've said in the literature any unauthorized tampering

00:28:23.429 --> 00:28:26.718
Can harm in some way your yoga?

00:28:27.749 --> 00:28:29.749
How do you explain this unauthorized?

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.039
Anthony tampering interference written by sahaja Yogi's you see the language is

00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:42.858
Probably people who try to awaken the Kundalini of course of course you

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.330
See the Kundalini can only be awakened

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.210
by a person who has the authority

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.769
divine authority

00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:59.718
You cannot elect a person you see like we can elect a priest. It's not like that. You must have the power

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.580
to raise the Kundalini

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.699
Now those people who are leading already

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:10.248
But you can say every in one word dirty life. You can see

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:14.839
Cannot raise the Kundalini

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:20.089
you have to belong to this pure religion inner pure religion and

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.570
You have to have these powers

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:41.179
Otherwise those people who try other tricks what they do they disturb your sympathetic nervous system

00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:43.590
activated

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.510
Kundalini doesn't rise

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.510
Kundalini will only rise

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.500
by a

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.500
proper sahaja yogi

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.020
For example I'll tell you

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.360
Supposing there is a seed

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.459
And you want to plant it

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.620
So you have to put it in the mother art

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.620
Supposing you put it on this table it won't

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.279
But supposing you put it in the fire it will burn

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.889
Only the mother earth has the power to sprout

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:37.620
That's what it is all right. I mean when you give communique Muslim is clear-cut all stuff. It's but I wouldn't understand myself

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.530
I'm sorry for that

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.609
What else these a lot of homework, I must say

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.030
It's great

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.510
and

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.510
That's why you must have read

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.129
There were some books in German also about Kundalini horrible books

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.409
That it harms you will burn chewed nothing of the kind it does not

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:10.890
It is the sympathetic when activated by wrong type of things like sex

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.669
activations another the activation some people

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:21.029
Try to turn this out and all that and you start seeing the light and all that thing. This is not short-circuiting

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.450
Actually you suffer a lot with that

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.219
It's a spontaneous it just happens to be spontaneously

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.160
Are you feeling relaxed yourself you got it

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.880
You've got your realization

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.870
Only thing you have to little bit know about it. That's all

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.200
absolutely relax this or thought

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.390
You got it

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.890
You got it

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:12.089
just while talking to me you got it because you are a positive person want to know about if you come with a

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.439
Determined effort just to criticize then nothing can work out is it

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:19.169
It's nothing's got it

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.570
You got it

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.390
May God bless you

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.699
It's your own I've done nothing I was just talking to you

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:35.459
Kundalini knows that you are sitting before me she just rolls by herself. That's your mother

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.080
That's your mother your own indeed your mother

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.910
That's the Holy Ghost that's the primordial mother

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:51.209
Which Christians don't talk about and then they don't want you to know anything else?

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.569
whatever they will teach you should learn nothing more I

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.959
Was myself born in a Christian family?

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:05.519
So you have to have you see blinkers on both the sides you're not supposed to see this fight work that side

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.929
And this is why young people fell a trap

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.890
To these horrible gurus who came to make money here I?

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.099
know of somebody who came from jail

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.160
Who came to Germany?

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.790
wearing those saffron clothes sat on one of the

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:30.090
Centers there somewhere and a relief rock to him he came from jail

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.450
Because you don't know

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.540
how to make out a good

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:46.170
Guru the sub guru and the a guru is there are books and books on that come India

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.780
but they don't know four things and

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:55.950
I don't blame them because they were seeking seeking so honestly that they got into trouble

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.709
But I have been talking about them from

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.440
1974

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.370
But the underworld

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:11.430
Another problem was with young people from the West was that they hated Christianity

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:16.230
That's one problem so when I talked about Christ they just under went back

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.140
You can talk to them

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.130
They said don't talk of Christ they went out

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:31.230
So this Christianity has done nothing but a harm to them that they just don't want to hear about Christ

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.769
Which Christ is a living God no doubt?

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.670
And I have to talk about him very much

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.250
But they didn't like it. It's such a problem of

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:48.100
Conceptions

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.740
Conceptions see reality is what reality is is not a concept

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:58.740
This is what it is see Christ is the son of God. He is the real

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.510
personality whatever

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:06.240
Church may do to eat or anyway do to it makes no difference he is what he is

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.850
And this is the problem is the concept?

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.940
Concept is not reality

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.040
that's just a mental prediction just

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.730
a mental projection

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.110
You have to rise beyond that

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.540
to be the spirit

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.140
All right

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.349
We got this nano your name, please

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.770
your name, please

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.700
George

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.990
Is the name of an angel

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.920
Yes st. George and st

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:51.739
George we call him as Bhairava in our Indian language. He's called as head of a st. George

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.730
Very great God

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.040
accordion

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.389
So we have nobody else now here Steve you have any questions

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.970
Now must be because you see you're a two-faced journalist, what about you?

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:40.159
Where has this message can spread in the world - which country

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.880
It's now 16 countries

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.129
There are thousands of people in about six of those countries

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.180
Of course of course we

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.929
Have here actual RCZ was in the Islam religion

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.660
from, Algeria

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.760
Then of course you know him very well, and here only you'll find people from different

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:19.490
religions sitting here

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.429
There's a lady from a Hindu religion there sitting and

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.050
What was your religion? Maybe she?

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.490
Born again

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.530
You self-certified God again, I thought no, that's same thing guys

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.000
All right

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.260
So of course no doubt we have an all religions all caste or creed like Sierra

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.019
Leone now we have got the Africans there

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.839
There we have got

00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:04.009
Spain we have gotten even into Bolivia. Will you be eyes what is that religion therefore?

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:11.539
Only we have a kind Bolivia and also in

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.470
Now in Peru everywhere

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:17.880
so

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:24.650
It is infinite it goes to everyone it cannot be see even God is one how can you have?

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.720
anybody barred

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.720
we have Chinese and

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:35.989
We have Japanese all types of people we have from all races from everywhere, so there's no question

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.760
what is

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:43.889
But actually I cannot give the list of all the nations, but practically all except for Scandinavian

00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:51.509
Nations we have not approved, but we have Scandinavian people in sahaja yoga, but we have not yet established centers

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.280
So many people were there

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:28.770
See I think Italians are great sensitive people

00:39:30.099 --> 00:39:32.099
Italians are very sensitive and

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:40.499
You will be surprised in Italy there are no gurus except in the north of Italy. They are very sensitive very emotional and sensitive and

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.970
they respect love and they have respect for mother all and

00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:51.149
When they saw my photograph they did feel something about it. I don't know what they felt about my photograph

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.810
I don't know what photograph. It was but they felt peace maybe

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.420
Whatever it is

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.790
But I was amazed the whole hall was filled with me absolutely and

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.830
Italians even as far as the government is concerned

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.669
All of them are very open to sahaja, yoga

00:40:13.089 --> 00:40:19.199
Surprising they're very sensitive people, and they must have found out about me that I have done all good

00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:28.319
There's no objection to anything and now they have invited me to a press conference which we do. I will tell you what it is

00:40:28.839 --> 00:40:36.839
It is a press conference of all the people of Italy it's a very big thing called as the press conference

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.720
guest of the Year mother most of the

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.370
Talking to all of them

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:03.519
Will be nice be nice really nice meeting them all yes

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:09.370
But I feel Austria is one country which is very much in the center somehow

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.169
It's very much in the center Austrians are neither East nor West

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:19.690
Centipede and they are very good for sahaja yoga, very sensible people in Austria

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:28.689
And we have found very sensible people in Austria no doubt about it another thing is Austria has never given us any

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.710
problem

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.710
We never got people who were

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:38.410
schizophrenic or nonsensical or fighting types nothing very nice people did want

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.050
surprising

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.840
So Austria has a special place. I think in Europe

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:12.669
It's very you know they are very heavy, and you're put very small means there so what happens

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.700
If they don't get it

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.550
What if they get it

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:31.509
Some people get the Kundalini raise some don't what happens to people after death if they don't

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:52.450
Religions work on a concept that you do it our way, or you end up in a horrible place

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.220
No, it's not like that

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.620
You see I think

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.750
most of the people should get it

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.660
to get a very generous

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.540
We work the whole thing as the world is today

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.329
It will be taken by people they have take to realization. I'm sure

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:20.259
Most of them will get it supposing if they don't get and die then there will be born again, and they'll get it

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.820
But those work to go to hell will go to hell in any way

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.110
in any way

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.160
You see there there. There are people as used

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:40.060
I would say who would never take to anything good would be there could be people I have not known

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.879
But maybe we should give all the benefit of doubt

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.740
Yes because you see

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:59.459
Yes, that is it now. I'll tell you what happens that your spirit is absolutely. It's absolute

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.429
Spirit is an absolute thing

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:03.540
supposing now

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.300
You want to know whether I'm good or not?

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.690
Or he's good or not

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:13.020
The good is not the way we look at things like you see we see the dress in the face

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:18.120
This is not looking superficially, but when we have to see person is good or not we see

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.940
We feel his chakras

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:28.049
What chakras he's catching you can feel them on your fingertips you see like Muhammad Sawa said that your hands will be speaking

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.590
So you feed on your centers than other person?

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:38.100
So we don't certify them as good or bad that category doesn't exist in sahaja yoga, what we say

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.319
What are the centers catching in a person?

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:48.300
Now what is catching in a person? What centers are wrong? We try to correct it?

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:54.449
We like it. We can say a patient comes to a hospital the doctors

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.740
Don't say you have good or bad. They don't categorize like that what they seem

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.870
What is the disease let us treat that it's like so the good and bad?

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:11.370
Is not described in sahaja yoga, what is described at the centers which are out of place?

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:18.570
But some people have ruined their centers completely have no Kundalini at all with them

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:23.610
They are like devil some of them must have been I don't want to name them, but could have been

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:31.949
So this is such people then what to do. They must have designer. I mean you cannot force anyone. That's the big problem

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:38.699
If they desire it well and put if they don't desire it you cannot just make them do it no you cannot

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.639
They have to desire it in their own freedom

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.360
Then they get it the joy

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:52.609
Nothing can be forced. This is the handicapped

00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:08.079
So we have don't know category we don't condemn anyone as bad, or we do not elevate somebody as excellent, but

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.240
We tell them what are the center sketching and when you get your realization

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.809
You will know what sketching in you and you will also know. What is catching in him

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:19.689
And then if I tell you supposing I if I tell him

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:27.220
Dr. Warren your other sketching means your ego is coming up. He won't feel bad because he'll get a headache there

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.220
They said better correct it mother

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.609
Which is ego will get a headache a little bit Surratt corrected?

00:46:34.279 --> 00:46:36.279
so nobody feels bad about

00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:42.879
It so there is nothing like good and bad are words used very vague. They are very weak terminologies

00:46:43.039 --> 00:46:47.499
This is not procedure about it because fear it is absolute so

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.889
Everything related to spirit is the absolute knowledge?

00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:54.609
You may say a person is very good

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:59.559
This is an excellent person that we don't accept what we accept is

00:46:59.559 --> 00:47:03.339
What are the condition of his chakras are and how much we can help?

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:13.299
That's not we not bothered about who's good who's bad that category doesn't exist that

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.980
Type of a category, but of course the condition of the chakras are varying

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.620
Any other question Steve. You better ask me. He's an American I

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.480
Describe it

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.809
I never had it so how much

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.980
I'm born like this but

00:47:54.670 --> 00:48:00.210
I would say the experience of self-realization that I have seen that happens to people first of all

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:06.540
When the kundalini rises you see of course the mechanism goes into complete force?

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:09.510
and

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.989
When she pierces through the fontanel bone area

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.930
first thing you feel is the

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.890
cool breeze in the hands

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:24.960
But not necessarily some people feel it on top of their heads coming out a cool breeze from their head own head

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:32.910
So the self-certification is there you see the cool breeze, but could be some people have too much heat coming out see supposing

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.910
It's a cancer patient especially

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:41.190
Or anybody like that to see this patient you find that a heat comes out

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.539
Supposing it's a person. Who is very much possessed and

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.630
extremely unhappy type of person maybe

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:55.050
Or an open person whatever it is the Kundalini you can see clearly with your own eyes

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:00.090
It's pulsating at different centers, but especially at the base of

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.660
the spine will be called as the

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.820
sacrum

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.110
sacrum

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:14.160
Sacrum is sacred both and the sacred book so you can see it very clearly we have got photographs of that absolute

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.380
Pulsation you can see like a heart

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.670
Then they experience moves with some people it does

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:26.789
I must say they do feel the rising if it is slow rise, but if it shoots off

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.940
You don't feel anything you just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:34.080
Then you start feeling out of your fingertips

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.999
But the feeling you get first of all

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:42.260
When heat rises about this Center you feel?

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:47.569
You're beyond, thought. You are in the present. We are not

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:52.190
Just enjoying the peace peace of your being

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.950
enjoying yourself in the way and

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.419
Then when it pierces through a kind of a

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:05.149
Joy that trickles it out in different different people have different

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:10.819
But say for Indians you see they don't think so much as you think you people think think think think too much

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.540
So they don't think so they get there first of all they get the joy

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.140
But in the West I think the people who get

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:24.020
More the awareness about it. They start feeling his chakras is chakras

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:29.179
They practice these that ultimately they get the gist, but Indians first get the joy they said

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:38.359
It depends on the condition of a person what the experience would be but on the whole

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:45.770
This one thing happens to all of you that your eyes start listening. They said listen. There's a twinkle in the eye

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:49.490
That's one

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:53.629
And their face becomes to see relaxed

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:57.619
The wrinkles drop out you drop out sometimes ten years

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:02.030
like see my aged 64 years of age -

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:10.280
But people can't believe it because you see I don't feel my age at all. I'm we all have forgotten what our ages are and

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:16.370
This is what happens to you because you go in a state of existence only

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.100
But takes little time

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:25.849
Gradually to grow into it, but it starts with the sprouting of this seed that is the Kundalini

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:31.909
But experiences people have different like in your case. It was very deep I know

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:40.400
Because he was a great seeker, and he has started a band without knowing the word surge on his own Siraj bad

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.299
I don't know how he started. He must have got it from the unconscious really

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.160
And he had such a strong

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:58.649
Experience because after that I met him for about five minutes, and then he went away to master and from Boston

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:02.160
He sent me a telegram that mother we are waiting for you in Boston

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.169
They said mother who is this one. I said he Steve I know him very well. I'm going down

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.369
And they were surprised they said how will you recognize you've seen him only for five minutes?

00:52:11.369 --> 00:52:14.639
I said I recognize him don't you worry I'm going down there

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:21.780
So you see all I can feel that also myself it in myself the person who's got it like I told you that

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.540
It's in a part of the collective is the collectively part

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:35.190
Because of collective consciousness you can feel another person and you can feel yourself

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.679
But he's an experienced on your central nervous system is the thing

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:48.629
But when you get joy, and when you get your awareness, it's a thing depending on the condition of yourself

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:55.109
Mostly the West people first become aware you're aware they start seeing things better

00:52:55.869 --> 00:53:02.549
Those who have never noticed say for example a very nice curtain is lying here, but people will come see superficially go away

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:09.240
But the sahaja yogi will see what a nice curtain what a nice pattern? What nice flowers what nice you see

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:12.690
Penetration into everything it starts feeling everything

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.470
Penetration is but experiences are different and different

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.560
like I think everybody must write about

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:26.069
Other a question that many people ask

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:31.709
At such conferences is this is why in the past was it so easy?

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:35.459
And so difficult, sorry, and why today, it's so easy

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.820
That's not embarrassing to ask me

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:48.779
But one should reach a conclusion there must be something about me

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:53.100
That I do it that easily all right one point our second point could be

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:55.650
explained with an analogy

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:59.760
That in the beginning there are very few flower flowers on a tree

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.450
Very few one or two

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:11.340
Then when tree comes up in age and plus sometime starts as thousands so the time has come

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.899
The time has come and I have come maybe that two things put together

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:21.449
But maybe I know the trick of the trade better perhaps

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.509
This is what I have discovered is our mas realization not individual, but

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:32.590
Alma's

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:36.600
That's what I have discovered if you want me to proclaim. I will proclaim that

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.770
but

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.450
There's nothing

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.450
Great about it I think

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.769
Because if you have something what is so great I?

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:51.390
Am achieved nothing you have achieved

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:59.310
That's the point is you have a dyad this with me you have achieved a

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.730
Channel you must ask me some questions he say he's a barrister

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.540
Miss lane miss lane

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:52.620
How they form different different, that's a good point now you see inside why you get into the essence of everything?

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.529
Say if you get to the essence of the three

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.200
The easels or the SAP of the tree goes to every flower

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.970
It doesn't discriminate

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.760
But flowers are different

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.850
Now what these people have done, they have plucked these flowers like somebody says this is my religion. This is pluck the flower

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:24.120
Then the flowers are dead now, so they are carrying on with dead flowers the religions are dead now

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.130
But they are flowering on the same tree and

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:37.110
You get inside the SAP through the root, so you see that everything is the same. It's just a manifestation of the same

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:42.390
Now electricity is flowing it is giving you there. It is giving you a air conditioning

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:46.529
It is working out there, but electricity is the same because you become the essence

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.209
But when you see from outside they look different

00:56:54.850 --> 00:57:02.159
Especially when deliberately they have plucked out these flowers and established, this is mine Christ is mine how?

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.190
Islam is mine how?

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:18.220
It is not you cannot have them as properties they cannot be your property

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.720
So this is what you realize

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:30.100
And that's why you see that everything has the same you see because now you have become aneesa's new eyes have opened out you see

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.159
That everything is the same you cannot become a fanatic now you cannot

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.330
Even if you try to be

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:44.199
It just cannot become fanatic anymore because you see the essence is the same I

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:50.710
Mean shoe got put into this you got put into that sugar put into that if you become the sugar you are

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.840
Everything isn't it I?

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:59.200
Mean religion had to be little different in its form because of the times that were there

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:03.969
Times where this way that way you see every time they had to change the outward

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:09.369
Form and things like that on social level and political level this that but he says was the same

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.890
Of course you can't have it anymore

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:35.529
That's very true because you see the essence is the same how can you see fanaticism comes from what finite we should say

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:39.700
When you go into infinity how can you have fanaticism?

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:49.059
You finite yourselves, I am these are these that is clubbing actually it is nothing but ordinary clubbing see

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.469
we have clubs like somebody puts the say the

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:58.870
Table where on the left side is one a club they put it on the right side another

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.619
They distribute you see this is just like stupid clubbing that sorts

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:10.809
You cannot club outcry God or Christ or any one of these incarnations? They are all brothers and sisters and relations of each other

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.600
They are all related Legion

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.370
But those people who were in charge

00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:31.400
Try to destroy them as soon as possible I take the charge

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:39.080
Christ Lee for four years how moments are believed. You know every one of them how they were tortured

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.250
That's what happened

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:43.520
Because they wanted to take advantage of that

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.680
But forgive them now all right

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.289
Any other question from you yes, yes

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:11.570
Hungry should we approach?

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:18.770
Seekers in these countries, which are not free such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia and in a way they're better off I did

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:21.830
I've been to Russia

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.860
I know they are not free

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.139
But you see when freedom is

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:33.950
One one should be able to very quickly see what is happening to the free countries today. If you see that warrant

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:37.140
If you go to America

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.849
You can't wear your watch. You can't wear your bangles. You can't wear anything

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.240
Maybe tomorrow they'll pull out your hair also

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:51.590
It's such a chaotic country so this freedom also human beings cannot be in a way

01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:57.889
As far as other these free countries are I tell you the people are so simple I?

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.670
Went to China I went to Russia because of my husband's job

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.629
I where all people are extremely simple the governments are not at all, right

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:13.670
But it will take no time for you to ignite. No actually it is already gone in a way

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.589
Logically they are understanding it now that sahaja yoga it

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:27.070
So it will come through Russia it will come through China from these bigger countries

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.139
But what about the free countries first of all tell me about them

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.649
Free it's a license

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:56.619
Because we will have people of that quality what we need is a transformation of human beings

01:01:57.619 --> 01:02:01.389
Hypocrites talk of big big things cannot achieve anything isn't it?

01:02:02.359 --> 01:02:06.098
But the people who believe not believe but no as

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.300
An actual thing that we are part and parcel of the whole

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:16.839
Will not think of one government another government will think of one world the world

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:23.890
All these so-called politics is because we are divided the nose is fighting guys eyes is fighting the years

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.250
When they discover we are one body what is there to find?

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:34.689
So most of the politics will be dissolved completely as it is now see look at us

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.579
We have powers

01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:42.609
So we are capitalists, and we want to give it to others so we have communists already

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:48.550
If you want to carry we don't want to conserve it

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.849
So we are already

01:02:52.579 --> 01:02:55.419
Doing the right thing the integration

01:02:56.089 --> 01:03:03.549
So all these problems come out of human beings and as soon as they become the spirit the problems will be dissolved

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:13.269
Social problems see we have already solved so many social problems in sahaja yoga. We don't have problems what you normally see

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:18.339
Our children are great our marriages are great. We are enjoying our lives

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.040
It's heavenly

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.869
One or two mishaps are there doesn't matter but mostly

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:39.399
We have a beautiful society no quarrel no jealousies no Fighting's no malice no hair trade nothing

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:51.999
Isn't it great to have such a society and no dictation nothing absolutely free

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.249
I know Mary. What did you want to ask?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.800
Why is it that people

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.850
Are missing the chance they read the poster?

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:30.860
and they walk by it happened to me in 82 I saw your poster I

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:51.950
See people are some are very superficial

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.520
Something known of themselves

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:02.060
They think they don't need anything all kinds of things that I know I agree with you, but it happens yes, please

01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:18.589
What're you

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:22.490
Saying that the advertising by the sahaja Yogi's

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.579
For this program sounds a bit like an ad for instant coffee. He thinks it is instant coffee

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.280
But he's saying that

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:39.979
CI tell you, but I tell you we buy instant coffee isn't it now in modern times everything is done

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.020
so we had to have instant you about

01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:44.490
It is what to do

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:49.310
It is but you see now we can say that you can get it after a lot of sufferings

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:55.639
And you have to sacrifice the same sacrifice that all right, but it's not true now what?

01:05:56.250 --> 01:06:02.929
It is instant coffee, but we take instant coffee. We want everything instant in this modern time why not yoga

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.220
So you tell us now how to advertise

01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:38.090
Yeah, you see what I'm saying that that's a fact. I really did it. That's a fact

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:46.309
That's a fact the Kundalini. I call it a jet Kundalini in modern times really I'm myself surprised that it's working

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.040
Just shoot wrong Oh

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:51.769
thousands of people in India thousands

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:54.630
See just shoot shuttle

01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:56.809
What am I to do it works like that?

01:06:56.810 --> 01:07:03.529
It's just I think the divine is anxious that let's have it down like that. It is in modern times. It's working very fast

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:10.339
Not only me ask him how many people he has given realization every one of them have given to thousands

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.999
realization I mean it seeing is believing but

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:20.330
Advertising we do not know what to say now. What is it written here now?

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:26.239
Perhaps thinks it's I don't know the English where it might be it's a little slick. It's a little smart, but

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.780
or

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.780
Something like that perhaps you mean more profound. Do you do you mean more deep more?

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.110
Sounding like the other gurus that come I don't know about observables what they write

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:55.499
But why don't you see tweet what you should write? I have no idea but

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:13.859
What should we see what should we say here and now is a fact I tell you we need

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.460
Now we can what should we say?

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.799
All right

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:32.939
But what I am saying for people to be attractive what is saying that when you have to attract people from outside

01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:36.029
then we should put

01:08:38.799 --> 01:08:41.429
Try to change it, I don't know what

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.179
I

01:08:47.179 --> 01:08:51.129
Think perhaps implied in Mary's question was is there a time?

01:08:51.259 --> 01:08:54.759
Is there a certain stage when you come to Santiago?

01:08:54.759 --> 01:08:59.289
Or is it that everybody should be brought in right now?

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:03.639
Do you reach a stage in your awareness where you're ready for it?

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:10.419
Or is it something that you just come if the advertising department is good is it worth?

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.020
You just I don't know what what what to say on this point because you

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:22.749
Cannot say certainly that people have to reach a certain stage because a person you see

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.509
His wife brought her saying that he's the worst man

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.399
He indulges in to this indulge us into that and all kinds of things bad

01:09:30.589 --> 01:09:33.729
Certificates about that fellow and as soon as he came in he got his realization

01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:38.859
You see the really true IT

01:09:39.889 --> 01:09:42.999
People suffering from cancer got realization in no time

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:49.479
So what is the stage I don't know, but maybe we can say the

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:55.359
Attitude towards life maybe

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.149
That's to towards life is you see say for example in the West

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:07.899
like these BBC people telling me that if you say that it is without money nobody will listen to

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:14.920
When I cannot say it is for money, that's one part. He said when you say free admission

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:18.070
Things is useless

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.400
The conditioning is so bad that if the free admission oh must be something funny

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.750
This is what?

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:36.009
Anglo-saxons brain cannot understand anything without money, can you imagine he told me frankly you said do you change this?

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:39.790
I said well. What should I say I don't take really you don't take any money what am I to say?

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:44.979
This is what it is you see is the conditioning of the mind, but in in English is not so

01:10:46.699 --> 01:10:54.459
In India if you see from the villages they'll come on bullet cards, they'll have miles together they'll walk when they will know I'm going

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.540
Also the knowledge is not here

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.569
They don't have no background what I would say

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:12.179
My background is needed, and I don't know the sensitivity is needed for Italians did not have the background, but sensitivity is their

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:21.180
Worst reason I would say in Switzerland or America is the worst of all

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:26.220
America fell for all kinds of guru because for sahaja yoga zero very bad

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:31.140
I'm sorry what it is. They don't look at sahaja yoga now

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:35.700
They are after they have had all the experience of all the guru shopping

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:41.729
They did now they're coming they want to do shopping. You know it's a fashion guru is a fashion

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.580
It's nothing deep it's a fashion

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:50.730
Going to this guru that will do that guru so how to talk to them they have money they want to shop it

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:55.230
How many cover the worst of all I must say

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:03.990
Experience wise supposed to be the most advanced most free country. They have the worst of all

01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:09.180
But in Austria I've seen the Falls are filled

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:11.770
They're full

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:16.410
In Austria we always get the how Falls are completely filled

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.850
just like

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:20.850
also in Italy

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:29.759
There is never death of people. I mean people have to sit on the stairs in Austria isn't it we don't have that problem

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.940
but getting realization

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.729
Is not possible for everyone perhaps

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:39.900
There's some sort of an understanding needed I

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:44.999
can't explain why because the house are also lighted you see in the

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:52.200
Halls are absolutely filled people sit on the stairs you see some are sitting outside some are standing on the street

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.870
Is there despite those facts there are sex and brain ceases?

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:01.710
Did you write free

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:15.150
Please come now gradually. They will see they have to learn their lessons a little bit more. I think that's all

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:20.160
They have to learn their lessons a little bit more now you with you

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.880
I'll tell you why because you are in the you and a big boss there

01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:26.489
Working in the you and itself's pulse your head

01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:29.940
I tell you I know my husband is there so I know all of them and

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.389
Their heads get swollen up to see you and personalities

01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:39.750
And you are attending big conferences you see so-called big big people receive it because you see me to

01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:45.389
Be the big head these things do not go in so it's alright, but now you are alright

01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:49.920
But that is one of the things you want people bureaucrats at the worst of all

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.030
There will be the last to come to sahaja yoga, my husband is a bit of that and I would deal with them

01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:00.449
I never talked to them about sahaja yoga, never never never

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:07.020
Bureaucrats Anthony you see they they only want to serve government. That's all

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.340
They don't understand anything. They are so bureaucracy is like that

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:16.260
Now what else you have in Austria bureaucracy, then you have military

01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:20.790
Students

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.780
Yes

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:52.150
Why should you have to

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.670
Do why should you have to rush it?

01:14:55.430 --> 01:15:00.849
There's no need at all I would be very happy if they don't worship like you see those who worship me

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.309
And found out something good out of it

01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:06.070
that's whatever so actually you know I hate that I

01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:12.280
Always see that these puja should be so much lengthy that I have some time to rest this

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:18.820
But I don't want them to worship me at all. It's very good. That's very good of them

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.639
I tell you some of them when they touch my feet I get blisters

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.279
Horrible as if yesterday. I was telling you like scorpion I

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.850
get such big big blisters on my feet I

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:33.909
Don't want them to wash it if you ask me

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:37.840
But they would like to because you know what it means

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.010
What's shipping me?

01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:42.010
You all know it very well

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.830
What's shipping? What do you give me nothing?

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.509
You just say certain mantras is that what do you give me nothing?

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:54.370
That's nothing to worship me for example now see my photograph this one

01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:59.289
Is when I was sitting in a village

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:06.280
When I entered the village I told him there is a very great soul who lived in this village

01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:09.579
They said there was one. He was a Muslim his name was Mia

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.030
So I said now

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:20.530
He must have been still here, and I sat down to be my lecture and I saw the spirit

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.749
Coming as a light of two. Hexa words to say on top of my head

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.800
I saw it right

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:33.099
but you can't see I mean people can't see but camera captured it the camera captured it and

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:38.680
Then the the sun's rays through that prism like spirit

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.539
Started coming as all seven colours on me. I could see

01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:51.290
I could see then I was very happy with increasing in this report, but nobody could see and then I said alright now

01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:53.419
It's more than sufficient like that I said

01:16:53.969 --> 01:16:59.389
But nobody can see it now. What's this am I telling them that yeah, you should see because you will not see

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:09.379
So why'd you tell anybody about my worshipping also till they understand it, but the camera caught it. What can I do?

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.969
And what the camera caught it I didn't say

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:18.649
Why do they worship Christ I've never seen in you

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:27.109
Why do they worship Christ murder they have never seen her what did she do she was just crying all her life

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:31.040
she didn't give realization to anybody even Christ did not give realization to

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.019
Anyone why do they worship him

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:40.310
You are a Christian you should ask them a question

01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:46.730
Why do the Muslims worship Kaaba

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:58.580
But in sahaja yoga, I am a discovery for you. I never asked anyone to worship me never, baba

01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:01.080
It's horrible for me

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:07.789
I have frightened of people trying to worship me because you see I have to take up everything of the stuff in everything that you

01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:14.329
Well yeah, they can tell me you that I just don't like it

01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:20.600
And I want to make a big gaps in between you see so that at least have some time to rest

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.780
Do something the whole thing digest it and take it out

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.619
So you need not tell them at all in the beginning you should not tell them anything concerns that you are great come along

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.260
Let them have the realization

01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:35.630
then if they're saying

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:42.649
Then we should consider whether they should worship me or not and everybody is not allowed to worship also

01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:47.960
Do you know that Mary we don't allow everyone to come

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.530
You have to be a clean person, otherwise they are not allowed

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:57.590
So the this worship is your privilege not mind by any chance. I tell you

01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:04.340
Any chance and which you will all say that mother is chance it I

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:10.460
Really, shun it and these false gurus because nothing happens to them they like it so

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:16.369
There's no explanation for this it is to be seen

01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:19.310
if they come to sahaja, yoga

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:25.999
They can see it very well unless until they come in it you should not talk of me as anything as incarnation anything

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.370
Just don't talk you should not tell them how to worship or anything just tell them that you have to get your realization

01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:35.689
Let them first open their eyes then talk to them about these things

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.180
In the beginning if you start talking they will be stuck no doubt they are stuck because they have not reached that thought

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.660
They have to be seaworthy to be in the sea isn't it

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:52.430
Yes

01:19:56.370 --> 01:20:02.479
Nothing is needed to begin with actually and I don't want anything really

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.580
If there is anything that

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.020
Is to be done is to give realization to everyone, that's all

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.080
but to progress further

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:17.460
They have to worship

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.640
They will worship somebody who is dead and gone

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.490
They never worship Christ when he lived they never worshipped his mother when he lived she lived

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:31.909
They never worship drama. They never worship, Krishna now when they are dead were nice to worship because they are stones now

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.910
What can they do to you?

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.599
That's human nature when somebody is dead

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:44.209
Then be perfect all right the ones who crucified Christ have raised these churches

01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:52.999
When person leaves you see in the present you never appreciate

01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:06.870
Because we don't allow anybody to worship, also. It's very it's a great privilege for anyone to be there

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:09.699
You know that?

01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.699
It's not for everyone so

01:21:11.949 --> 01:21:16.859
Many people have been denied in England and all that just now you have to prepare yourself

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.400
Everywhere

01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:25.770
And yesterday I was telling me know that you should not have brought clad lady. She was no good

01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:28.530
The one who was your roommate Oh?

01:21:29.949 --> 01:21:36.179
Was pestering you I said, she was very caught up, and you should not have brought her from the Buddhist that disturbs me

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:47.009
It's very significant, but like a person who has to be a postgraduate student to understand certain things

01:21:47.739 --> 01:21:51.689
You have to be a postgraduate in sahaja yoga to be in aversion

01:21:53.469 --> 01:22:01.229
Otherwise you should not so you don't stock of these things. It'll get stuck no doubt when I have no doubts about it

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.150
Anybody would get stuck

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:14.250
Because looks so funny isn't it that you have to worship another human being it is so we have to use discretion

01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:22.589
Anybody would be stuck that way unless until you are a first-class sahaja yogi

01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:27.540
And you understand the value of it you have gone deep into it. Then only you realize

01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:31.710
It's to be appreciated

01:22:38.139 --> 01:22:44.558
I never talked about me at all to anyone now. I really some Saints started talking about me

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:49.328
Some Saints only told some people that this is this

01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:53.109
Then they came and asked me and I said all right you find out for yourself

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:04.360
You see with human beings you have to be very very careful and cautious, I do not want to get crucified

01:23:05.929 --> 01:23:07.340
See

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:14.019
To be very very cautious with them because ego is the first thing they come in they don't understand. What is beneficial for them

01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:19.539
See what did Christ do to them did he ruin them, or do any bad to them, but they crucified him isn't it?

01:23:20.059 --> 01:23:22.059
They gave poison to Muhammad SAW

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:25.029
Why what was the thing?

01:23:25.939 --> 01:23:28.449
Because he go so should we calculate

01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:37.089
Even when you write supposing in your wherever you write should write it cautiously she make it so that

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.049
According to your own understanding that they come to my program

01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:43.880
Use your wisdom

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.269
What you want to put it how to put it?

01:23:47.269 --> 01:23:53.319
or if you want to say you can say that at the first instance the Kundalini rises and

01:23:53.959 --> 01:23:57.429
Then you have to grow into it if you don't want to say quick

01:23:58.010 --> 01:24:03.340
instant coffee business, so you may say like this that might might reprise I

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:05.860
Would suggest that way?

01:24:06.769 --> 01:24:08.799
All right that you turn

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:13.329
But with the people some of the very deep people they just get realization in

01:24:13.579 --> 01:24:18.069
Thousand it because they have been deep people all their lives not life, but lies

01:24:18.979 --> 01:24:20.979
So they just hit it

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.230
So it attracts people who are superficial then it's not a good thing to say

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.450
That may be one of the reasons that only superficial come to our program

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.080
We should find out how to write that the deep people are attracted

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:54.009
Isn't it we should find out ways and methods by deep people are attracted not superficial I?

01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:59.080
Gave you the whole gets filled up because maybe superficial

01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:07.059
Like a saint on see nobody buys anything. It's just to say law and everybody comes to see the same

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.109
This is Kali why is he this is a

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:20.020
Confused state in this. This is a this is the age of confusion

01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:29.589
This is the age of confusion really?

01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:40.270
Also some people say that why should I give realization? I said better you give very good idea

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.510
I would like to return

01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:47.230
See this is ego. Isn't it? Why should you do it?

01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:52.779
I mean I'm doing it because I do it alright, but if you can do it nothing like it. I'll return

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.820
I'll be very happy I

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:03.519
Mean my age has is beyond doubt retirement I would have retired long time back see going on and on

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.729
So also you should see the people who they are and

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.350
Then talk to them

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:19.239
Must use discretion very important to use discretion

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
As he said it may be some people may not get it in this lifetime, maybe next time

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:34.180
Also it happens that the seer some

01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:39.999
people get realization say for example and the transform and

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.820
become something very beautiful

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.270
Then the mediocre mediocre people you see

01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.539
May see that and try to follow it

01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:53.170
The mediocre may try to follow it

01:26:56.510 --> 01:27:01.390
Like when I went to Italy this gentleman was a very famous person who interviewed me

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.750
He said first you give me realization then I'll Italy

01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:09.680
Because

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.319
Perhaps he believed in me whatever. It was or may not have believed might be doubting whatever it is

01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:17.260
He got his realization, then he started laughing

01:27:18.469 --> 01:27:22.479
And he said also, I've got it now. I said yes, you got it now

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.219
It is he who is organizing all this thing so maybe like this it might forgot

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.210
Depends all you see human beings are quite complicated in modern times

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:39.219
Very difficult to hold on to them if you give them this they'll come this way if you give them that they'll come this way

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.500
Just I don't want to have it

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.439
Just some hooks or excuses it's terrible I know

01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:52.160
Especially in the West it's very difficult

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:59.629
But they'll accept her something stupid like Punk's

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:03.110
Thanks you will find thousands now

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:12.109
People in very high positions are punks now. Can you believe it imagine our Prime Minister going as a punk?

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.120
They accept stupid things without any questioning

01:28:19.199 --> 01:28:22.129
Think of it drugs for example

01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:30.350
They accept it without any understanding without any asking and very

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.030
educated

01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:35.030
highly placed people doing

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.400
Absurd things like that

01:28:38.219 --> 01:28:42.019
Alcoholism womanizing everything all nonsensical things

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:50.149
But to do something good to yourself it takes time a

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.339
Very self-destructive by temperament

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:59.120
Just do something nice to ourselves

01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:03.319
To get some blessings upon ourselves yes

01:29:10.989 --> 01:29:12.989
We'll be all right

01:29:14.289 --> 01:29:19.349
They have to learn their lessons that's collecting as they have to learn their lesson

01:29:26.679 --> 01:29:28.679
Satisfied

01:29:29.889 --> 01:29:32.429
I'm happy he's a very wise man

01:29:32.429 --> 01:29:38.098
He's done the homework the other people just came just like any that for fuck out you see it's a deep subject

01:29:38.559 --> 01:29:40.559
It's a very deep subject

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.610
you cannot just

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.610
Up here and go out

01:29:48.999 --> 01:29:50.999
Steve are you going to?

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.859
Put this into the world

01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:55.079
No, but you see well one point

01:30:55.079 --> 01:30:59.998
I see in is what he's saying that one of the things this really come to my mind is this

01:31:00.159 --> 01:31:03.029
That this may be that we get superficial people

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:11.610
So we should put something deep in it because it's very deep experience

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:19.920
Suggestion you see there is something which explains certain things

01:31:21.969 --> 01:31:27.598
They like my lectures all right, they like to listen to my lecture because you see it appeals to them mind

01:31:28.119 --> 01:31:32.699
But they don't get realization so that means they are not very deep

01:31:47.409 --> 01:31:49.409
Yes, that is one thing yeah

01:31:49.929 --> 01:31:53.969
Now for example in Switzerland we put our these things

01:31:54.730 --> 01:32:00.209
Nobody removed it still their last three years. It is there. It's very surprising in Switzerland

01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:04.319
Where people are so meticulous they have kept my photographs?

01:32:05.679 --> 01:32:07.570
In Italy us

01:32:07.570 --> 01:32:10.019
All my three year old photographs are there

01:32:11.139 --> 01:32:17.669
It is there. What about also I must say that advertising whatever it was in

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.800
Australia

01:32:23.619 --> 01:32:25.619
Australia is

01:32:25.809 --> 01:32:27.809
very progressive in such

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.460
Australians imagine

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.460
Can you believe it that they were?

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:37.469
Sent there as criminals their forefathers and today. They are the ones who are going to take everyone to

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.969
spirituality

01:32:39.969 --> 01:32:41.969
So how can you say good and bad?

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.539
Australia is the best

01:32:46.539 --> 01:32:48.539
Well Stella is the best now I?

01:32:49.269 --> 01:32:57.179
Mean in progress. We have the leader from Australia for the Warren started the whole thing and we have James has he come

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:09.330
May God bless you may God bless you
