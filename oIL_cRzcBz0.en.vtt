00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:55.700
You must pray, to God and ask, what you want.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:04.140
Ask for: Complete satisfaction in my heart,
joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.660
the whole world becomes blissful.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:14.960
Give me love, love that I could… love the
whole world and that the whole world becomes

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.180
one in love.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:36.660
Give salvation to this… humanity.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.580
Which is suffering.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.690
Take me to Your feet.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:56.090
Cleanse me with Thy love.

00:40:05.074 --> 00:40:07.894
Now see if there is God or not?

00:40:07.894 --> 00:40:14.114
You can feel it within yourself.

00:40:14.114 --> 00:40:16.134
He hears you.

00:40:16.134 --> 00:40:21.094
He understands you.

00:40:21.094 --> 00:40:29.474
He’s the glory of all the glory.

00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.174
He loves you.

00:40:33.594 --> 00:40:35.434
He protects you.

00:40:35.574 --> 00:40:37.554
He guides you.

00:40:37.554 --> 00:40:42.854
He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

00:40:53.254 --> 00:41:04.634
Any time any thought is coming you pray and
you will be moving in the waves of that ocean

00:41:04.634 --> 00:41:12.374
which is unconscious mind, which starts with
thoughtless awareness.

00:41:43.748 --> 00:41:56.348
If you cannot become thoughtless,
you pray to Him: “Forgive me for what I

00:41:56.348 --> 00:42:04.008
have done and forgive those who have done
harm to me.
