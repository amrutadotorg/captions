1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:11,520
Now the question he asked me was, in the 
nature of an  enquiry of a person who wants  

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,240
to find out, what is the proof that there is God.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,900
How are we to convince people, what is God?

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,770
That we have to achieve something, 
as far as God is concerned?

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,380
How are we to convince them that we 
have got all these centers within  

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,710
us and that you have to achieve that realization?

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,480
And also how are we to prove to others 
that you have achieved your realization?

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:01:00,180
This is the question which everyone 
who is not yet a fully Sahaja Yogi  

9
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,700
would feel and ask you questions 
and you should have answers to it.

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:14,070
The first and foremost question is 
how do we prove that there is God?

11
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:22,050
Because you assumed that there is God 
because somebody has said, “There is God."

12
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:29,100
Now what are the ways of 
proving this that there is God?

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,280
So we have to attack the question,  

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,800
first from the reasoning point of view 
that we should be able to tell people  

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,690
that there is God through reason not through 
experiencing because they are to be prepared for it.

16
00:01:51,690 --> 00:02:01,050
There will be many who really do not believe 
in God but just out of fashion they’re saying,  

17
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,340
“All right we accept” because they want 
to keep up peace and the compromise.

18
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,150
But how you start about 
convincing them rationally?

19
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,460
Perhaps I spoke in one of My lectures if you 
have that, I don’t know if you have got it.

20
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,130
But we can prove it – the existence of God.

21
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:34,485
You may call it God or nature or 
whatever it is, from many point of view.

22
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:40,560
For example in short we can say, “There are 
many scientific things we cannot explain”.

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:52,560
We cannot explain how the periodic laws were 
established without somebody being there.

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:04,410
Periodic laws of chemical substances 
or the elements that exist on this  

25
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,960
Earth is so regular and so properly 
plotted down that you can see there  

26
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,150
must be some plotter otherwise it cannot be done.

27
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,650
I mean if you want to avoid it, you 
can avoid it but there must be someone.

28
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,580
Say we come in this room and find 
everything properly organized,  

29
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,620
lit up and we should know there 
must be somebody who has done it.

30
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:35,160
Then a very good example is given 
by a very good French biologist,  

31
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:48,210
he says that if you use law of chance, the 
law of chance states that – if you have got  

32
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:58,020
fifty red pebbles and fifty white pebbles put 
in a jar and if you shake that jar it goes into  

33
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:07,740
a chaotic condition and the distribution 
of these pebbles is in a chaotic way.

34
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:17,640
To bring them back to their normal condition of 
having the red on one side and the white on the  

35
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:26,460
other side, you go on shaking it as many times 
as you like and they have found out – there’s  

36
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,820
minimum of minimum so many times it has to 
be done otherwise it cannot be worked out.

37
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,200
This is all done by chance.

38
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,290
You see by chance when it has 
to come to normal condition.

39
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,790
How many chances you have to take?

40
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,580
There’s a certain amount of a formula.

41
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,490
Something raised to power ‘n’, call it ‘n’.

42
00:04:50,490 --> 00:05:06,660
So as a biologist he tried to calculate that if 
matter has to become living, then to get to that  

43
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:21,900
density how many years are required by the law of 
chance to bring forth a living cell – one cell?

44
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:28,110
And he found out that billions and 
billions and billions of years,  

45
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:39,150
if this law of chance works out then only 
one unicellular animal can be created.

46
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:51,190
But in this short time from when the Earth 
receded from the Sun and then cooled down  

47
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:59,650
and then life came into being, then human 
beings were created who are very complicated.  

48
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,530
It is such a short time, compared to 
that time which is required by chance,

49
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,750
that he has proved mathematically that 
it is an impossibility, it cannot happen.

50
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,530
It is that fantastic.

51
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:20,680
This is a scientific very good proof 
of a biologist that there is somebody,  

52
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,270
a juggler, who is doing that job.

53
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,040
You may call Him ‘God’; you may call Him 
‘Nature’ whatever is, but the nature thinks.

54
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:34,630
People like Yung have proved the 
existence of collective consciousness.

55
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:46,480
The existence of unconscious, which gives us 
dreams through which we get universal symbols.

56
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,570
All over the world whether we are 
in India or in England or anywhere.

57
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:59,230
The symbols are the same and he has done 
experiments with thousands of people.

58
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:05,020
On the medical science also one 
can say as you know that one of  

59
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:14,110
the arguments we put in for is that 
acetylene and adrenaline which are  

60
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,780
two chemicals when they are in the body 
– human body, they act very arbitrarily.

61
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,240
Means they have to augment – 
mean to contract or to relax.

62
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,320
Those who relax must relax; those 
who have to contract must contract.

63
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,350
But those who are supposed 
to be contracting relax,  

64
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,790
while those who are supposed 
to be relaxing contract.

65
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,560
So they have not been able to explain and 
they have written, all of the doctors,  

66
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,740
they say that the mode of conduct of these 
chemicals in the body one cannot say.

67
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:58,510
Another thing is that one of the very very 
important arguments that people have given  

68
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:04,930
is this that supposing a foreign 
body goes inside the human body,  

69
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,850
there’s always a tendency to 
throw it out as soon as possible.

70
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,250
Supposing something goes into 
your throat, you cough out.

71
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,460
Supposing something goes in the 
blood, they will try to throw it away.

72
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,290
That’s the system it is.

73
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:25,750
But when the fetus is formed in the 
body, then not only it is kept there,  

74
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,500
it is nurtured, looked after and 
thrown out at the right time.

75
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,450
How can you explain that?

76
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,330
There are thousand and one explanations people  

77
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,610
have tried to give but none 
of them are satisfactory.

78
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:46,330
Then this Earth is spinning with such a 
speed and we are kept glued to this Earth,  

79
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,680
we never even feel the speed.

80
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,510
And so many things like that people have been 
able to say and the so many scientists have  

81
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:03,550
felt that, there is some force which 
is beyond us which is very dynamic,  

82
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,580
which acts in such dynamic 
ways that we cannot explain.

83
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:14,290
So we come to a point where we tell people that 
there is some force which we have to discover.

84
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:22,030
Now then as Sahaja Yogis you can 
say that this hankering to seek.

85
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,470
After a certain level of evolution  

86
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,830
because some people do not have 
at all seeking, you know that.

87
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,280
They are just seeking food 
– to eat just like animals.

88
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,290
Some people are seeking power.

89
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,430
Some people are seeking money also.

90
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,010
But there are so many people who 
are seeking something beyond.

91
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:52,690
This seeking has come to us and this seeking that  

92
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,890
has come to us has led us to some sort 
of a path by which we should find out.

93
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:05,830
Now you have seen with your naked 
eyes, a Kundalini rising at My Feet.

94
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,410
You have seen the pulsation of the 
Kundalini taking place. That nobody can do.

95
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,570
There is no mesmerism, nothing.

96
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:22,090
When the Kundalini rises, with the stethoscope 
you can feel the rising of the Kundalini.

97
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:28,810
With the rising of Kundalini you have known 
that we have cured people of different diseases.

98
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,430
Even a person who was just dying,  

99
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:37,510
whom doctor had decided that they are dead 
and to be buried very soon, have been cured.

100
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:44,020
And it is so dynamic, the dynamism I’ll tell you.

101
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,580
It’s so dynamic – like we 
can take the case of Eddy’s

102
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:48,850
brother.

103
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,770
That he was so very sick and they said,  

104
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,220
“He has got blood cancer, he’s 
going to die within eight days”.

105
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,050
I mean he just told Me this, 
that’s all and he’s cured.

106
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,805
Then Linda told Me that her mother 
was always angry with Peter.

107
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:10,810
[Mother speaks aside – “Where is she gone?

108
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,850
Where is she?

109
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:29,260
Linda!”] – So she told Me that the 
mother would never talk to Peter,  

110
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,960
she was very angry with him always, 
she would never talk to him.

111
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:39,130
But she told Me all these things and suddenly she  

112
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,880
found that now she’s become very good 
and congenial and nice and talking.

113
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,230
You have seen such transformations 
coming among many, many, many people.

114
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,450
How people are changing, transforming, this 
is absolutely dynamic; you cannot do it.

115
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:03,820
So many sick people are suddenly 
cured only through attention you know.

116
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:23,200
There must be something about it and that is 
how you have to convince people about Sahaja.

117
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,730
But after getting realization you just see the 
Kundalini, you see the rising of the Kundalini.

118
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,110
You also feel the vibrating force of Kundalini.

119
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,990
You also see how you got cured, 
how you got out of your problems.

120
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,300
How you were in trouble?

121
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,210
What problems you had?

122
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:57,940
You had seen all these things and 
these things happen to you also.

123
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:05,500
Some of you were drug addicts, some of you 
were suffering from some mental troubles.

124
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,390
Some were having physical problems.

125
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,090
All these, you see, are cured and 
you are much better people now.

126
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:21,610
This has happened to you very easily 
without much effort being put into.

127
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,720
It is not possible to get 
rid of these things easily.

128
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,690
Definitely you can raise the 
Kundalini, you can feel the Kundalini.

129
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:39,070
You can, you know for definite that 
when you say that person has got this  

130
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,270
left Swadishthana or anything everybody 
says the same and you are sure of it.

131
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,850
It is not possible for everyone 
to say the same thing, even the  

132
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,690
children saying the same thing about a 
person and he says also it is verified.

133
00:13:52,690 --> 00:14:04,660
So part of it comes to you in complete 
proof that there is something about it.

134
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:16,870
Second part also comes to 
you as a proof because now  

135
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,700
you know there are vibrations flowing into you.

136
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,170
There’s no jugglery about it.

137
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:26,410
And then you can feel it very clearly.

138
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,570
You have raised the Kundalini of many people.

139
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,920
You have given them realization; even 
the photograph has given realization.

140
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,225
You know for definite it is so.

141
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:47,020
And also you know that if you want 
to ask any fundamental questions,  

142
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,120
you get answer as a great flow of vibrations.

143
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,110
So when you ask the question 
[Mother speaks aside].

144
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:03,550
When you ask the question, 
“Whether there is God?”,  

145
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:10,060
Immediately you get tremendous 
vibrations proving that there is.

146
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:18,460
You ask the some questions, which 
you know for definite and say,  

147
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:28,990
“Is it so?” And you know that it is not so, 
definitely you do not get any vibrations.

148
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:35,620
That’s how relatively you know when do you 
get vibrations when you don’t get vibrations.

149
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,140
If you ask a very big fundamental question, 
you get vibrations of a very strong nature.

150
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,570
But in ordinary things you might get a little.

151
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,980
So it proves that the vibrations 
speak to you as vibrations.

152
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:58,370
This should prove that there is God 
because you have asked on vibrations  

153
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:04,730
and you have found that there are 
vibrations and that there is God.

154
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:15,140
Now what happened in the case of Buddha 
that He got realization as you got it and  

155
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,650
He had no way of finding out 
whether there is God or not.

156
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,420
So He said, “There is no 
God, only there is ‘self'”.

157
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,410
But you have gone beyond it.

158
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:34,970
So if you find seventy percent 
of the proof through your own  

159
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,060
experiencing it and raising 
of the Kundalini and all that.

160
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,820
Then the thirty percent, whatever it is, is 
to be ascertained through the vibrations.

161
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,530
And when you ascertain it through the 
vibrations – for example I say, “This is hot”.

162
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,030
How do I know?

163
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,310
By feeling it itself, it is hot.

164
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,450
Now anything that makes Me hot is hot.

165
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,870
But relatively I know this is 
hot, that is hot, that is cold.

166
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:07,850
In the same way on vibrations also you can ask 
various questions and find out ‘yes’ and ‘no’  

167
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:18,380
and then you can believe it – that there is God 
Almighty and this all pervading power exists,  

168
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,670
not only exists but operates, 
the rest of it is all a myth.

169
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:32,240
But when you rise in Sahaja Yoga being Sahaja,  

170
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,810
you take it for granted, as we 
take everything for granted.

171
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:47,720
All the trees growing, the mango tree giving 
a mango, guava tree only gives guavas.

172
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:55,550
We never try to find out how in one little seed 
so much is built in, so much is programmed.

173
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,430
We take it for granted all these 
great miracles of the world.

174
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,510
In the same way we take this 
miracle also for granted.

175
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,120
This is what ‘maya’ is.

176
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,070
That is makes everything 
look so simple and straight.

177
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,860
And you just start taking it for granted.

178
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:30,860
Then you have to understand that it is 
not to be taken for granted but is to  

179
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:38,270
be very much respected, worshipped and accepted.

180
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:49,940
The amount of preparation you have, 
the amount of strength you have,  

181
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,170
that is the amount of truth you are going to get.

182
00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:01,160
Truth also weighs you very clearly 
whether you can receive it or not.

183
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:09,320
There is no diplomacy that can work this out.

184
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,670
No cheating, nothing.

185
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,890
Truth knows how far you are.

186
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:23,420
The more you become stronger, the more the truth 
manifest through you and you receive the truth.

187
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:31,250
Just now some of you are still 
little babies of three months  

188
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,600
and four months and something like that.

189
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:44,630
And still sometimes taken for granted you do 
things which you should not do and harm yourself.

190
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,670
Its only question of harming yourself 
not harming Me or harming Sahaja Yoga,  

191
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,310
which cannot be harmed, but you harm yourself.

192
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:57,350
So one has to be very careful 
one should understand the laws  

193
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:09,410
and regulations as Gavin had read the 
last time, the statutes of God’s laws.

194
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,260
You must understand how it works.

195
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,270
You cannot take law into your 
hands by taking it for granted.

196
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:27,780
Law operates and it knows everything.

197
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,110
It is the law of love.

198
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,640
That’s why it allows you to 
make little mistakes to learn.

199
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,960
But it will not protect you when you start 
saying that, 'all right I want to do it on my own'.

200
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,970
“All right”, it says, “All right go ahead”.

201
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:54,810
So one has to know that this 
law operates not blindly,  

202
00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:03,150
lovingly and it tries to teach you also sometimes 
that don’t do this wrong and don’t do that wrong.

203
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:13,230
But when it comes to real punishment, the 
punishment is that this law leaves you alone.

204
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:23,520
It just lets you go; the attention recedes, 
that is the worst thing that can happen to anyone.

205
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,470
That you are not in the attention 
of God is the worst thing.

206
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:35,130
So even if you make mistakes doesn’t matter.

207
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:43,890
Pray for the attention of God always because 
the attention of God is the law – 'law of love'.

208
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:50,610
You cannot cheat it. Everything is known.

209
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:58,530
Every word you say is known, 
every word you don’t say is known,  

210
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,250
every thought that comes in you is known.

211
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:12,330
So purify yourself with love, understanding.

212
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,970
Try to purify and tell yourself that, “I 
have to purify myself as much as possible”.

213
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,420
With purification only, you 
will have the proper strength.

214
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,540
If you have not purified, then there won’t 
be any strength for you to bear the truth.

215
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:36,960
Once you bear the truth, your own life 
will convince people that you are Divine.

216
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,380
Your face will convince people.

217
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,750
Everything that you do will convince people 
that you are Divine and whatever you say,  

218
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,050
people will know it is 
coming through Divine Force.
