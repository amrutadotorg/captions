1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:13,769
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,480
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:30,029
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it,
we cannot describe it, we cannot purchase

4
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,219
it.

5
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,920
It is, it has been and it will be.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:50,730
I’m so very happy to see so many seekers
of truth in Los Angeles.

7
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:59,210
So whatever I’m going to tell you today,
you are not to take Me for granted, nor you

8
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,180
have to believe Me blind-folded.

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,690
We have had lots of problems because of this
kind of blind-folded faith.

10
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:24,090
But whatever I’m telling you, you have to
know that this is just a hypothesis I’m

11
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,350
putting forth.

12
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:39,390
If it is proved, then you have to believe
in it as honest people because it is for your

13
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:47,240
benevolence, it is for the benevolence of
your family, it is for the benevolence of

14
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:58,180
this city, it is for the benevolence of your
country and it is for the benevolence of the

15
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,840
whole world.

16
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,489
It is important that now we have to think
about our benevolence.

17
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:24,010
We have had lots of fun, pleasures, all kinds
of enterprises in our life.

18
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:35,040
But what do we seek in those enterprises is
joy, anand.

19
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,239
Whatever you want to have, you want to have
it because you think by that you will feel

20
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,230
satisfied and you’ll have joy.

21
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,170
But it is not so.

22
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:58,760
Today we want to have, say, for example, a
house, all right?

23
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,430
Then we want to have a car.

24
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,569
All right, then we want to have a helicopter,
I think.

25
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,170
Then it goes on like that one to another.

26
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,810
We are never satisfied.

27
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:26,090
If these desires were pure desires, we should
have been satisfied when we got them.

28
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:36,599
Also economics says that in general wants
are not satiable.

29
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,040
Now whatever you have been told about this
power which is residing in our triangular

30
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,879
bone called as sacrum, that means the Greeks
knew it was a sacred bone.

31
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,989
They called it sacrum.

32
00:03:53,989 --> 00:04:09,599
And this bone has this power within us which
is the pure desire and what is the pure desire?

33
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:19,670
That is the truth about ourselves that you
are not this body, this mind, this ego, these

34
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,130
conditionings, this emotions, this intellect.

35
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:36,650
You are not that because you say my emotions,
my ego, but who is this “my”?

36
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,860
So you are not that.

37
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:47,150
The truth is you are the pure Spirit.

38
00:04:47,150 --> 00:05:02,199
The second truth is that there is a all-pervading
Divine power of love.

39
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,780
This power of love does all the living work.

40
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,640
For example, now you see beautiful flowers
all over.

41
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,580
We take them for granted.

42
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,449
We don’t even think that it’s a miracle.

43
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,569
Who runs our heart?

44
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:26,690
If you ask the doctors, they will say it is
autonomous nervous system.

45
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,009
But who is this auto?

46
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:44,080
So all these living things are done by the
Divine power of love.

47
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,750
I say to you this, you need not believe it
M. But tonight you are going to feel it, you

48
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:58,199
are going to feel it on your finger tips this
all-pervading power of Divine love which is

49
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,539
called as paramchaitanya in Sanskrit language.

50
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:10,250
In Koran it is called as ruh, in the Bible
it is called as the cool breeze of the Holy

51
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:21,470
Ghost and Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara
Pragya, which is rather a tongue twister.

52
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,230
So this power exists.

53
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:33,400
You see the result, you see the result that
living things are happening.

54
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:41,610
Now if you go to the science, it has its own
limitations.

55
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,730
First of all, science is amoral.

56
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,699
You can destroy Hiroshima, is all right with
science after all.

57
00:06:51,699 --> 00:07:05,169
You can do whatever you want to do because
you think you have mastered the matter, but

58
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:12,789
that is not our job is to destroy people all
over the world.

59
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:24,509
This idea of destruction comes because we
forget that we do not know the absolute truth.

60
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,710
First we have to know the absolute truth,
then we’ll know where are we.

61
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,470
What are we doing?

62
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,860
What we are supposed to do.

63
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:42,419
You are quite aware as to what is happening
in the world, especially in America about

64
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,180
which I am very much concerned.

65
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,520
As you know, there are sixty-five per cent
people are expected to be sick within ten

66
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,020
years’ time.

67
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:07,349
It’s not only a sickness of the body but
of the mind and this destruction will one

68
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:18,069
day create such a vacuum that we’ll be all
shocked 

69
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:23,350
why we are born as human beings and why we
should be destroyed?

70
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:30,620
After all, the Creator has created us with
such understanding, with such love, He has

71
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,490
evolved us to this position and now why should
we be destroyed?

72
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:43,440
The reason is: we must find out why are we
on this earth.

73
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:54,860
We are on this earth to become the Spirit,
to be a channel of God’s love and above

74
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,519
all, to enter into the Kingdom of God.

75
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:07,780
When I say to you it sounds rather impractical
and people can’t believe it.

76
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,350
It’s a fact.

77
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:19,730
It’s the truth, I’m telling you that the
time has come for all of you to become the

78
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,730
Spirit.

79
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,790
It’s a special time.

80
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,470
I call it a Blossom Time.

81
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,280
They call it the Last Judgment.

82
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,170
Some people call it as Qiyama.

83
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,540
Even in Sanskrit there are words, many words
to describe it.

84
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:48,860
So now we have to be the Spirit, otherwise
we should see with our own eyes the destruction

85
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,510
of our fellow men and of ourselves.

86
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,149
There’s nothing in between.

87
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:08,290
Either you become Spirit or all kinds of destructions
will start.

88
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:16,800
You’ve been already told about the centers
that exist within you.

89
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,820
On the medical side, we can say that they
express themselves and manifest themselves

90
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:36,560
as plexuses, but also they act on the left-hand
side as shown there on our mind.

91
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,250
So we’ll take one center and I’ll tell
you what can happen to you.

92
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:49,380
Of course, Sahaja Yoga is a meta science.

93
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:56,839
Whatever I’m saying you can find out and
you’ll discover that whatever I’m saying

94
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,019
is the truth.

95
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:08,519
This one chakra we’ll deal today because
I could feel what’s the problem of Los Angeles.

96
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:18,750
This center that we call as Swadishthana , the
yellow-colored one.

97
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:26,720
It comes out of the third center what we call
the Nabhi chakra, the solar plexus.

98
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:39,010
But this one which manifests aortic plexus
moves all over your abdominal viscera and

99
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:53,839
gives energy to your liver, to your pancreas,
to your spleen, to your kidneys, to your intestines

100
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,839
one side.

101
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,950
Another thing important thing it does, about
which I think doctors don’t know, perhaps,

102
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,610
is that it transforms energy for the use of
the gray cells.

103
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:23,149
The gray cells in the brain we use when we
are futuristic, we think too much, read too

104
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,029
much, when we are very mental.

105
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:37,440
This energy is used and for that this poor
center has to work very hard.

106
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,949
Today’s life as it is, you see, where it
is so futuristic.

107
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:50,690
Not only that but we have become really very
mental people.

108
00:12:50,690 --> 00:13:00,790
We go on thinking, thinking, thinking and
this thinking is done by the gray cells which

109
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,360
require the energy.

110
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:12,149
So this poor center has to work for this only
work when you are a thinker.

111
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:15,110
Now it has to do other things also.

112
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:24,150
So it neglects all other viscera.

113
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:40,769
(Mother talks aside.)

114
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,470
So all others are neglected.

115
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:51,550
Now when the liver is neglected, it is a very,
very important, extremely important organ

116
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,300
in our body.

117
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:04,990
It takes out all the poison from our body
as heat and pass it into blood.

118
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,449
It cleanses through this process.

119
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:19,000
But when this liver is neglected, it cannot
do that work which it has to do; then the

120
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,019
heat starts accumulating in the liver.

121
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:32,830
Such a person is quite a hot-tempered person,
very hot-tempered can be.

122
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,199
When he tries to control the temper, he gets
even worse.

123
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:46,009
That’s not the only thing that happens.

124
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:54,250
This heat consumes all the fats and such a
person starts becoming extremely thin.

125
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,910
He doesn’t like food, he doesn’t like
people.

126
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:10,529
I mean his attention becomes extremely disturbed
and he thinks no end of himself.

127
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:17,279
He thinks that all others are stupid fools;
I’m the only wisest person.

128
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,279
If anybody thinks like that then they should
know they have a liver problem.

129
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,829
Now thus a thing called ego starts growing.

130
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:37,850
This is the white color into the brain crosses
over and you get a big balloon of ego.

131
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,830
That’s on one side, doesn’t matter.

132
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,490
But what happens to your body?

133
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:59,680
This heat of the liver then starts rising
and when it goes to the pancreas, you develop

134
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
diabetes.

135
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,410
Is a very common disease of modern man is
diabetes.

136
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:12,399
Now can you imagine in India we have villagers,
simple people.

137
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,959
They don’t think so much, you see.

138
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,699
They earn, today, eat their food, sleep off.

139
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,029
Next morning they are again up.

140
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:27,069
They don’t have to insure anything, they
don’t have to worry about it.

141
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:34,769
But they take so much of sugar, sometimes
four, five spoons, big spoons.

142
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:43,899
The spoon must stand straight at right angle
otherwise they think this is not tea at all

143
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,110
and they take it three, four cups of tea.

144
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,330
They never get diabetes.

145
00:16:47,330 --> 00:17:00,009
It’s a wonderful thing, you know, that you
can have as much sweet as you like, you never

146
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:01,220
get diabetes.

147
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:11,860
Now these villagers don’t think but those
who are sitting on their chair planning, thinking

148
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:19,959
of the future all the time, they definitely
get diabetes.

149
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:29,730
Then what happens?

150
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:39,400
Then the another movement of the same heat
goes to spleen and now this is even worse.

151
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,580
Spleen is a speedometer.

152
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,480
It keeps our speed.

153
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,340
Supposing we have eaten our food and then
we want to run, get a pain here, because it

154
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:59,760
supplies red blood corpuscles for emergencies.

155
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:11,000
If the spleen goes out of order with the heat
as well as the kind of life we have, a very

156
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
hectic life.

157
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,880
First of all, what I see in America is really
terrible because they get up late, in the

158
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,990
night sleep late first of all and get up late.

159
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:29,030
Then early in the morning they have to go
to work, so they are in a hurry.

160
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:36,509
They’ll pull back their jeans and then I
don’t know.

161
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:42,840
They don’t eat at all, they don’t even
brush, get into the car, start brushing and

162
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,660
then they have their food in the car, or call
it the breakfast, so-called breakfast.

163
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,210
Here it is all the cars are honking and you’re
getting late and there’s a jam, this that.

164
00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:00,740
This poor spleen doesn’t know what to do,
because it’s such a hectic life.

165
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,910
It doesn’t know how to cope with such a
hectic person who sometimes needs this, sometimes

166
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,740
needs that, so it becomes hectic.

167
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:23,429
But then it is vulnerable to a very serious
disease which we call as blood cancer, leukemia.

168
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:32,429
On the contrary, if our life is a peaceful
quiet life, we nicely get up in the morning,

169
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:39,230
have our bath, don’t go for jogging, that’s
also another thing.

170
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,380
Jogging is right-sided.

171
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,440
Jogging is all right for people who are lethargic,
you see.

172
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,760
Indians would be better.

173
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,870
But not for Americans.

174
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:57,230
Because this is the physical as well as the
mental side, right side.

175
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:03,470
And suddenly you get a shock or something
happens.

176
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,110
Specially the newspapers.

177
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,430
They believe in just giving you shocks.

178
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,000
So in the morning you read something.

179
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,620
“Oh, what has happened?”

180
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,669
And you get a shock.

181
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:21,790
Now you won’t believe the way they are describing
now the calamities in India are not so bad.

182
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,400
I’ve telephoned, I found out, it’s not
so bad.

183
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,620
But why the newspaper are doing because they
love to give you shocks and you also love

184
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,390
them because they give you shocks, I think.

185
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:44,990
So in this shocking conditions this poor spleen
of yours cannot cope and that’s how you

186
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,100
get this horrible disease called blood cancer.

187
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,450
Now I must tell you with Sahaja Yoga we have
completely cured blood cancer, completely

188
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,260
cured of many people.

189
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,539
It’s a fact.

190
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:04,110
Without going to doctors, without going for
diagnosis because in the diagnosis only half

191
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,090
people die, but we know their trouble.

192
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,299
They and we know what they are suffering from
and it can be worked out.

193
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,760
Just this Kundalini is to be raised.

194
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:23,500
She goes to this center and just pacifies,
enlightens it, nourishes it and the whole

195
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,059
thing changes.

196
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,350
I’m not telling you a cock and bull story.

197
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,250
I really tell you.

198
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:39,440
You should know that it is all happening,
it’s all happening today, everywhere.

199
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:48,179
Then the third thing that happens is that
your kidneys get coagulated and you get kidney

200
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,620
trouble.

201
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,289
Then you have to go for dialysis and you end
up as bankrupts.

202
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,370
I mean they do not cure you with dialysis.

203
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,580
No, there’s no cure with dialysis.

204
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:11,240
But the only thing that happens that you can
become a bankrupt and then die.

205
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,040
Then it goes to intestines, creates problem.

206
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,529
You never feel hungry and whatever you may
eat, you get into constipation of terrible

207
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:27,960
dimensions and that leads to then hernia and
all kinds of diseases.

208
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,600
So with one center how many things you are
suffering.

209
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,900
But that’s not the end of it.

210
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,380
Then this heat rises upward.

211
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,090
There’s a center we call it as right heart.

212
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,740
Here you can see.

213
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,960
When this center is affected, you develop
asthma.

214
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,130
Asthma is one hundred per cent curable in
Sahaja Yoga.

215
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,260
We have a doctor who got his MD.

216
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:09,710
Now he’s in America for curing cancer, curing
asthma through Sahaja Yoga.

217
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,010
Absolutely curable.

218
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:22,460
So with the intestines, with the kidney, there
are problems which seem, looks like, people

219
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,490
say, is incurable, but not.

220
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:32,280
These are the fundamentals we have, and if
you have to deal with the fundamentals, then

221
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,700
the rest of it falls into proper picture.

222
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Like supposing now there’s a tree which
is sick.

223
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,090
Now if you start treating the leaves, you
can’t cure.

224
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:55,570
If you try to correct it through its branches,
you can’t cure.

225
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:03,330
You have to go deep down into the roots and
the sap that rises will cure it.

226
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,090
In the same way, these are the roots.

227
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,419
This is the knowledge of the roots I’m telling
you.

228
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:13,590
I see Los Angeles every year is growing and
growing and growing.

229
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:20,320
America is growing very fast, no doubt.

230
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:31,590
But when a tree of this civilization is growing
so fast we must find out about our roots.

231
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:40,049
And if you do not find out about your roots
how are you going to look after this huge

232
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:47,840
big civilization you have created which is
dry, which has no nourishment?

233
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,279
So we have to go to our roots.

234
00:24:50,279 --> 00:25:00,350
Another problem is that if this knowledge
is coming from India, people have an objection.

235
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,610
It should come from America or from England.

236
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:22,279
Many people believe that Christ was born in
England.

237
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:30,679
Is impossible to say that all right, you have
science, which we have learned; now we have

238
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,679
something.

239
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,690
Why shouldn’t you learn, if it is for your
good?

240
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,350
It’s only not I am saying that.

241
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,540
We had poets in London like William Blake.

242
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:49,419
He has said for these days that the men of
God will be born in those days and they will

243
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:55,760
become Divine and they will have powers to
make others Divine, said by an Englishman.

244
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,710
I don’t know if you read C.S.

245
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,710
Lewis or not.

246
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,299
Another one, so many.

247
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,429
There was also one poet.

248
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:05,600
He was Englishman who came in here and lived
here.

249
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,990
I read them and I’m surprised that this
has already been predicted.

250
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:19,830
So some people start thinking about it and
they think, “Let’s go to religion.”

251
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:25,399
Nothing wrong with religion as such and nothing
wrong with the people who have created it,

252
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:36,700
but I must say people like Jesus Christ or
Mohammed Sahab were really very, very great

253
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,950
people, were very, very great people and they
were so much evolved.

254
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:50,470
They were so much evolved that they never
understood human beings, what sort of things

255
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,220
they are dealing with.

256
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,409
I’ll give you an example.

257
00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:04,550
Fifth chapter Mathews, Christ has said that:
“If your one eye does anything wrong, take

258
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,360
it out.

259
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,429
Otherwise, take out the other one.

260
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:17,279
If your one hand does something wrong, then
you cut it or cut both the hands.

261
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,460
If somebody slaps you on this side, you turn
the other side.”

262
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:31,350
I have yet to see one Christian who has cut
his hands or taken out his eyes.

263
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,510
Is impossible.

264
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,059
He thought you were such, we were all such
great…

265
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:43,390
I was born myself in a Christian religion
so I was shocked, how could these people follow

266
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:49,450
these rules and regulations which are beyond
human beings because they’ll have to take

267
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:56,470
out their eyes or they’ll have to cut their
hands?

268
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,930
Then Mohammed Sahab thought that such strictness
was there for men, why not we have something

269
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,930
for women.

270
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,120
So for women also, he said, “All right.

271
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:15,250
If a woman is not moral, she should be put
in the Mother Earth and should be beaten with

272
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,279
shoes or with stones.”

273
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,549
Now imagine: What about American ladies here?

274
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:29,549
It’s a dangerous situation.

275
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:38,290
So then came the another one called Sharia,
you see, it was actually given to the Jews

276
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,039
by Moses when he saw they were very decadent.

277
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:48,850
So he gave them this, this is in the Jeremiah,
who has written clearly that he said that

278
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,769
if you steal something, your hand should be
cut.

279
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:56,750
All this Sharia was given to Jews, but Jews
were wise.

280
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,010
They said, “Baba, we can’t do this.

281
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,010
No, no.”

282
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:05,870
So the Muslims have taken over and they are
putting on their […?] I have yet to come

283
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:15,730
across one Muslim who can be called as a real
Muslim, or one Christian who can be called

284
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,090
as a real Christian.

285
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:23,029
It’s none of their mistakes, after all,
they are human beings and these laws and regulations

286
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,660
are for saints.

287
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:31,120
If the saints do anything wrong, then they
should be punished.

288
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,340
Not for ordinary human beings, it’s too
much.

289
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,010
But to us religion now has become a matter
of fighting.

290
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,870
And then you see people, they go on distributing.

291
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,130
Now like the other day a fellow came with
a Gita to Me.

292
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,890
He walked up to Me.

293
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,830
“You must buy this Gita.”

294
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,120
I said, “I have many already in the house.

295
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,220
But,” I said, “Why are you wearing this
dhoti here?

296
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,149
It’s Chicago, is a very cold place.

297
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:06,260
You know, you should not wear this dhoti.”

298
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,400
He said, “My Guru has initiated that I must
wear a dhoti.”

299
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,830
I said, “Do you think by wearing a dhoti,
you will go to heaven?

300
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:21,490
In India everybody wears a dhoti, will theyl
all go to heaven?

301
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,710
Try to understand now.”

302
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:31,070
Now shaven his head completely . I said, “Why
do you shave your head?”

303
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,310
He said, “That’s what my Guru has told
me that if I have to be spiritual, I must

304
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,310
shave my head.”

305
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:44,971
Kabira has said that if, by shaving your head,
if you can go to Heaven, then the sheep is

306
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:57,779
shaven every year, there won’t be any place
for you there!

307
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:08,640
All the saints who were real saints were full
of fun about all these things and they could

308
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,660
see that this is all stupidity.

309
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:24,300
The way people are trying to create this kind
of fanaticism is all stupidity.

310
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,960
It is, then we feel disappointed.

311
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,399
Same about Hindus.

312
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:38,320
Hindus, it is said that in every human being
there is a Spirit.

313
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,300
Everybody has the Spirit in the heart.

314
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,230
Then how can you have caste system?

315
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,580
How can you have a higher race and a lower
race?

316
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,649
There are so many examples to show.

317
00:31:52,649 --> 00:32:01,380
For example, Shri Rama ate the fruits from
an old lady who had eaten them before to see

318
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,419
that they are not sour.

319
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,210
In India if somebody eats something you’ll
never eat that.

320
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,809
But look at Shri Rama and then He tells His
wife, “Oh what fruits!

321
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:13,840
I’ve never eaten like that.”

322
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,029
But the brother was angry.

323
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:21,600
The brother said, “Why should she give you
such fruits, it’s not proper.”

324
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,590
So the wife says, “Please give me some.

325
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,929
After all, I’m your wife.”

326
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:28,389
Then she eats something and says, “Wow!

327
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:29,860
What fruits!”

328
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,289
Now the brother Lakshmana says, “Sister-in-law,
give me also little bit.”

329
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:38,720
“No, you were so angry, I will not give
you.”

330
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:51,260
The whole story shows the love, the compassion,
the oneness, because of love.

331
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,770
Krishna also had food with a person called
Vidura who was a son of a maidservant.

332
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:03,080
He wouldn’t go with the king and eat food
but He would eat with this.

333
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,279
Now why?

334
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:12,600
Because he was a realized soul, Vidura was.

335
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:20,260
Every story of Christ or anything you see
is nothing but love.

336
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:29,649
But if you are bent upon taking something
like Christ went to a wedding and He made

337
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:31,940
wine out of water.

338
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,799
That’s the simple thing.

339
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,639
Now I can also do that, not difficult.

340
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:40,179
But that’s not the wine.

341
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:46,389
That is the taste of grape juice.

342
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:48,460
For wine it has to rot.

343
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,700
Instantaneously who can make wine?

344
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,519
How can you make wine just by touching water.

345
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,519
You cannot.

346
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,110
It has to rot.

347
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:07,720
The more rotten it is, the better it is, they
say.

348
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:21,770
I’ve never tasted so I don’t know, but
smells horrible, I can tell you this much.

349
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:29,830
Now, so we don’t know what to do because
go to religion, there we find fanaticism.

350
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:38,030
We find people fighting in the name of God,
making big money out of, I don’t know but

351
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:49,480
I read a book about where it said the Vatican
printed one million, no, nine million dollars,

352
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:58,970
nine million dollars as counterfeits and distributed
through their own bank.

353
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:08,560
How could any religious man think of doing
these things, I can’t understand.

354
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,060
First of all, they have to be holy people.

355
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,940
They have to be righteous people.

356
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:21,570
If they have interest in your purses, then
how can they be holy men?

357
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,650
God doesn’t understand money.

358
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,210
It’s your headache.

359
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,880
Banking is your headache.

360
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,870
How can you purchase God with money?

361
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:39,780
So I appeal to your intelligence, to your
wisdom, to know that this your American country

362
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:49,370
has fed so many false gurus so far without
even thinking what they are doing, without

363
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,130
even finding that they are just making money.

364
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,190
They are marketing some nonsense.

365
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,800
That’s another problem.

366
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,870
When I came here first nobody would listen
to Me.

367
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,870
I said, “Why?”

368
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:10,190
“Because you don’t take money, so what
is the credibility?"

369
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:16,670
They can’t understand anything without money.

370
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,770
All right, doesn’t matter.

371
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:23,820
Now the situation seems to be better.

372
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:30,400
But the last thing that happens to you is,
very serious thing with this Swadishthan chakra,

373
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,090
is that you get a heart attack, a massive
heart attack, especially if you are young,

374
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:43,410
and you are playing, say, tennis and you are
drinking too much, you get a heart attack

375
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,350
which is very massive and which is always
fatal.

376
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,720
Angina is different.

377
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,240
But this massive heart attack comes from this
right-side problem.

378
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:05,500
Then this heat rises into the head and what
happens, you get paralysis of the right side,

379
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,660
minimum.

380
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:13,840
There are so many diseases out of one center
you can get.

381
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,230
Then you go to some guru.

382
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,180
He puts something into your head, I don’t
know what they do.

383
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:31,260
Then you get cancers, you get incurable diseases,
you get insomnia, all kinds of things you

384
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,310
get and ultimately you realize, you have gone
mad.

385
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:41,010
I mean I don’t know, a mad man doesn’t
understand he’s mad, but others know.

386
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,420
But wisdom should be there.

387
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:51,120
When you choose a guru, you must know anybody
who wants money for spiritual work cannot

388
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:59,430
be a holy person, cannot.

389
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:06,200
So at this juncture you have to know that
when this Kundalini rises, first thing that

390
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:14,140
happens to us that our innocence starts manifesting.

391
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,720
Innocence is eternal, it is not temporary,
it is eternal.

392
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,570
Whatever you may try to destroy it, it is
there and it starts manifesting and then your

393
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:32,840
eyes become innocent, absolutely innocent,
and very powerful and there’s a glint of

394
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,820
the spirituality in your eyes.

395
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:49,300
Such eyes are so powerful that even a glance
of such a person can settle down thousands.

396
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:59,500
With this innocent eyes you understand that
your attention has lost lust and greed completely

397
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,680
and you have become a very moral person, very
righteous.

398
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,340
Nobody has to tell you, don’t do this, don’t
do that, no.

399
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,750
Just it happens.

400
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,750
Now how?

401
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,540
It’s like this, if I have a snake in my
hand, and I’m a very obstinate person and

402
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,890
you tell me, “There’s a snake in your
hand, please leave it.”

403
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,520
I’ll say, “No, there’s no snake, it’s
a rope.”

404
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:28,320
Till it bites me and I’ll go on saying,
“It's a rope”.

405
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,770
But if there’s a little light, I’ll throw
it away.

406
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,250
I’ll know this is wrong.

407
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:43,310
As a result of this happening, whatever is
destroying within you, you may think it should

408
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,280
be given up.

409
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,730
You may not be knowing also that it is destructive
but you just drop it out.

410
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,730
Overnight.

411
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:59,110
I must tell you I have known people who have
dropped drug addiction.

412
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:07,910
Here such a problem exists of drug addiction
and can be completely cured with Sahaja Yoga,

413
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,750
I can assure you.

414
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:17,150
If this Kundalini rises, then not only drug
addiction but any kind of addiction drops

415
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:23,770
off.

416
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:31,280
Then you know all about your centers on your
fingertips.

417
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,490
You know what’s wrong with you on your fingertips.

418
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:42,020
With this light you know where lies your problem.

419
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,700
This is self knowledge.

420
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,390
On your fingertips, means on your central
nervous system, in Sanskrit the word is bodh,

421
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:56,020
from where the word Buddha has come, or also
is Vida from where the word Veda has come.

422
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:04,500
You have to know the truth, not mentally,
but on your central nervous system, on your

423
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,930
fingertips.

424
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,940
So you know the absolute truth.

425
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,710
Now there are many who came to me who never
believed in God.

426
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,790
Atheists, they call themselves, especially
in Russia, say Russians.

427
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,840
But they took no time to get their realization.

428
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,460
They are such a clean slate, I tell you.

429
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,870
They have no conditionings, nothing.

430
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:37,850
And you won’t believe that we always have
our program in stadiums.

431
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,120
We cannot have in halls.

432
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,750
We’ve got sixteen to eighteen thousand people
in one place.

433
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,050
What is happened with them?

434
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,760
Why is it they are so sensitive?

435
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,750
They have thrown away all false gurus, one
by one.

436
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,250
They’re not bothered.

437
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:05,380
After all at least, I must say, sixty per
cent people in Russia are so sensitive to

438
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:10,950
spirituality, very sensitive.

439
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:21,130
Most amazing thing is that they jump into
it without any difficulty.

440
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:30,160
I don’t know how they trust Me so much but
they do trust themselves first and then do

441
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,310
trust that they have got self-realization.

442
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:39,820
I don’t know if you have told them or not
that recently they had a conference of two

443
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,350
thousand scientists.

444
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:48,180
Their scientists are very highly qualified
people where they invited Me to speak to them.

445
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:54,200
In the conference I was the chief speaker
and I was amazed.

446
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,050
There were also ten thousand other people.

447
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,460
The subject matter they gave Me, “Medicine
and Self-knowledge.”

448
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:12,110
They all talked about morality, how important
it is to preserve the society, to preserve

449
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:18,530
the families, to preserve the whole society.

450
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,520
And they were such great surgeons, there was
one surgeon ninety-year old who had operated

451
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,490
on our prime minister Indira Gandhi, who is
still operating.

452
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:32,160
He’s ninety years, and the way he speaks
you wouldn’t make out that he’s of that

453
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:40,440
age, and he has written a book against alcoholism
and immorality.

454
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:49,040
I can’t think such a subject can ever be
talked about here where your Hollywood is

455
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,370
so important.

456
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:57,220
What harm they have done to you, you don’t
know.

457
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:07,380
First of all, Mr. Freud, who just was worshipped
like Christ and he has ruined the people and

458
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:15,740
brought them to the sex point only.

459
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,180
He is from Austria and when I told this in
Austria, they were very happy.

460
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,040
They clapped, they said he’s brought such
shame to us.

461
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:35,220
But here he was worshipped and now the whole
country has been so much degraded by him.

462
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,110
Now I read the book, “Freudian, Fraudulent
Freud”.

463
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:44,160
There’s another book: “Downfall of the
Freudian Empire”.

464
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,370
But with that, how many have suffered?

465
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,190
What has happened?

466
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,000
Families broken.

467
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,470
What nonsense he talked about.

468
00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:00,000
The mother, that your relationship with mother
is of a sexual nature.

469
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,320
God knows he must be having something like
that.

470
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:10,430
I told this to an Indian, he said, “Thank
God he didn’t come to India, otherwise we

471
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:15,690
would have cut him into pieces and thrown
him into Arabic Sea.”

472
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:21,040
How could you accept such an unwise, nonsensical
thing?

473
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:29,310
Well, you did and so many people who thought
it was big experimentation, this that.

474
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,970
It is absolutely a myth, I tell you.

475
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,762
If you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will know
what is a psyche, how it gets affected, where

476
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:43,260
it is, how it works out the real knowledge
about psychology, you will know.

477
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,250
This is psychology or is it child science?

478
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,430
I don’t understand.

479
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,690
It has nothing to do with reality, everything
imaginary.

480
00:45:51,690 --> 00:46:01,770
Jung, Jung was the one who got realization
and he did say that Freud was wrong.

481
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:07,680
He was the one who said it and who talked
of morality.

482
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,490
But I must tell you one story about Myself.

483
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:18,580
They invited Me to a conference of the Jungians.

484
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,550
It was International Jungians Conference.

485
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:29,770
Me, poor thing, was supposed to talk about
Jung and I told them where did Jung went wrong

486
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,110
because he said the consciousness is vertical.

487
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:42,170
No, he said it is horizontal which is not
so and that was the biggest mistake.

488
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,500
But whatever it is he talked of morality.

489
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,384
But next day the president, now he’s no
more, so I can tell you the story, came to

490
00:46:51,384 --> 00:46:52,384
see Me.

491
00:46:52,384 --> 00:46:53,384
Eighty-five year old, shaking, you know?

492
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:57,920
He came to Me, said, “I have some private
work.”

493
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,370
I said, “What is it?”

494
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:06,690
“I have a keep and my wife is dead.

495
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:15,260
Can you please help me to cajole this keep
of mine, to tell her that she should now marry

496
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,260
me?”

497
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:24,740
"What's the age of your fiancé or whatever
you call it?"

498
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,880
"Only about thirty-eight years."

499
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,440
I said, “Do you think I am supposed to do
all such work?”

500
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,920
Now this is a Jungian who is talking like
this.

501
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,030
If it was a Freudian, I could have understood.

502
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:47,400
I was shocked and to come to Me for this kind
of a nonsense.

503
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,530
I said I don’t know what’s wrong with
these people.

504
00:47:53,530 --> 00:48:01,240
They can’t even understand that spirituality
is holiness, auspiciousness, is purity.

505
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:08,800
Can’t understand how he came to ask Me this
question.

506
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,740
I was so disappointed that nine years I didn’t
visit your country.

507
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,460
I said, “How can I talk to them?”

508
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,590
[“I have a keep” means to have a mistress,
Ed.

509
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,590
]

510
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,800
Today I have to tell you one thing.

511
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:28,930
The time has come for all of you to get your
self-realization, by which your attention

512
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:38,600
becomes enlightened, your health gets completely
all right, your mental processes are sensible,

513
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:47,120
but above all you stand in your present.

514
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:55,260
We live in the past or the future and all
the time we are thinking of past and future.

515
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,740
We are jumping on the cusp of past and future.

516
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:06,360
With this happening you become thoughtlessly
aware because these thoughts elongate.

517
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,110
Thoughtlessly, but aware.

518
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:15,970
And this thoughtless awareness is the time
which is reality in which you grow spiritually.

519
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,940
Then you get your inspirations.

520
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,550
All your potential qualities starts manifesting.

521
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:35,120
You’ll be amazed in India we have had many
great writers, very great, we should say,

522
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:40,830
poets, very great musicians who are now world
famous.

523
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:45,100
All of them came to Sahaja Yoga.

524
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,930
They were nothing.

525
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,500
Even Miss India that was this time Miss Universe.

526
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:56,260
She is a Sahaja Yogini, and she came to Me,
she said, “Mother, is it all right if I

527
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,670
go for this beauty contest?”

528
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,770
I said, “What’s wrong?

529
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:00,770
You go.”

530
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,040
“I don’t want to wear funny dresses.”

531
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,310
I said, “But you wear, after all, swimming
dress, it’s all right.”

532
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:12,190
She, she was not such a beautiful girl.

533
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,940
She asked Me, “Mother, I’m going just
now for Miss India.”

534
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,880
I said, “You’ll be also Miss Universe.

535
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,960
Take it from Me.”

536
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,720
She became.

537
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,440
Because what is the speciality?

538
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:32,620
It’s not only the face, it’s not only
the features or anything, but it is the inner

539
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:39,860
beauty, it’s the balance, it’s the poise,
it’s the wisdom, all these things put together

540
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,990
make a personality.

541
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:46,480
Not only just your face, how you look.

542
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,870
That’s not important.

543
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,580
See, look at Mahatma Gandhi, how he looked
like.

544
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,740
I don’t know I have seen him, I have lived
with him in my childhood.

545
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:07,190
Such a bony structure, but even Samson would
have been afraid of him, he was like that.

546
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:12,540
Such a power of truth and honesty in his heart.

547
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:21,850
It’s not that his face was very impressive,
but the inner power which was within him.

548
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:24,970
I know of another prime minister very well
Lal Bahadur Shastri.

549
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:31,770
I’m talking about him because both were
born on the same date of 2nd of October.

550
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:35,930
Another person, tremendously powerful, very
short man.

551
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:44,130
So powerful he was and his realization of
such a high degree.

552
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:50,520
He could easily make out who [BREAK IN RECORDING]
Of course, he respected Me very much.

553
00:51:50,520 --> 00:52:02,120
I used to be very shy,because he would not
even sit before Me 

554
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:10,390
on the chair.

555
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:15,080
Is what we call self-realization.

556
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:24,430
In Sanskrit an egg is called as Dwijaha, the
bird is called Dwijaha and a human being,

557
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:29,320
when he is realized, also called as Dwijaha,
means born twice.

558
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,960
So first it’s an egg, then it becomes a
bird.

559
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,670
There are two different things.

560
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:39,620
In the same way, first we are a human beings
then we are realized souls.

561
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:44,430
This is the new age, this is the new race
which has come up.

562
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:52,980
Is nothing, just put a brand here, one, like
any other twice-born, like any other person

563
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,980
you are behaving.

564
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Why?

565
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,980
What is twice, twice-born?

566
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,150
Or I am a Christian, and a Hindu, and a Muslim
or anything.

567
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:07,480
It’s just a brand because anybody can commit
any murder, any sin, anything.

568
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,690
So this transformation is your responsibility.

569
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:19,220
You have to take to this transformation, and
you have to change people.

570
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:26,780
If you have to save your country, now learn
this: that you can do it.

571
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,770
You can easily do it.

572
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,750
Is very simple because is all built in within
you.

573
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,590
Now what do we do?

574
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,090
Just put a seed in the Mother Earth and it
sprouts by itself.

575
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,090
How?

576
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:45,470
Because the seed has a built-in quality to
sprout and the Mother has a built-in quality

577
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,800
to make it sprout.

578
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:55,400
In the same way, you all have this power,
this glory is within you, just it has to happen.

579
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,160
It sprouts and then you have to grow.

580
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,440
I don’t know how people trust Me so much.

581
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,360
I am an Indian after all.

582
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:10,580
I could be an immigrant, or whatever.

583
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,910
I could be anything.

584
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,840
But they trust Me somehow.

585
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,510
But later on, they do not trust themselves
and they do not grow.

586
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:28,520
It’s a very sad thing, not in Russia, I
must tell you, not in Russia.

587
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,300
There’s a joke.

588
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:37,930
We had a seminar of thousands of people in
Russia and there was one American Sahaja Yogi

589
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:45,450
and a Russian Sahaja Yogi asked him: “How
many do you have Sahaja Yogis in America?”

590
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:51,760
So he said, “To be precise, it is fifty-six.”

591
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,890
So this Sahaja Yogi from Taliatti says, “Oh
my God, you are fifty-six thousand?

592
00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:01,490
We have only twenty-one thousand here in Taliatti.”

593
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,210
They can’t understand.

594
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:08,350
They think Americans are very bright, very
smart people.

595
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,660
There must be at least 56,000.

596
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:18,680
Americans are known to be very intelligent,
very smart.

597
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,550
So they’re taking to Coca Cola culture now.

598
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:28,650
Russians, forty per cent, because they think
Americans, after all, you know, they take

599
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,970
Coca Cola, they go to McDonald.

600
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,290
They’re very smart people.

601
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:39,251
They’re ruling all over the world and all
your junk which doesn’t sell here goes there

602
00:55:39,251 --> 00:55:43,690
and they are really trying to look like Americans,
you know.

603
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,690
Whatever it is.

604
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:53,020
Why I’m trying to say this, is the whole
world is looking at you.

605
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,060
They follow you.

606
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:59,000
This Hollywood doesn’t understand its own
responsibility.

607
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,620
The whole world is following you and the way
they speak also English is very surprising

608
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,320
is just like American English.

609
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,990
I take about two days to understand that.

610
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:16,730
But now in Russia they are speaking the same
English as you speak and it’s a difficult

611
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:17,730
situation.

612
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:25,460
So, you have to understand the second responsibility
that, as citizens of this great country, you

613
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,880
have to lead the whole world into righteousness,
into morality, into constructive beautiful

614
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,880
life.

615
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:40,260
You have to enter in the Kingdom of God and
settle there, whatever may be your race, whatever

616
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,090
may be your religion, or all these nonsensical
differences.

617
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:50,540
But it’s very important and you’ll be
surprised, the first country I visited was

618
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,890
America.

619
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:57,470
I would say, first I went to Iran because
my brother was there but after that I came

620
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:00,850
to America and I was surprised.

621
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:05,330
How do they take to falsehood so easily?

622
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:08,490
Even Indians who come here become stupid.

623
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,380
I don’t know.

624
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,380
Really.

625
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:18,660
You won’t believe, this there’s a gentleman
who is organizing the marriage of Rama and

626
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,660
Sita.

627
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,090
I mean they were married long time back.

628
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:23,400
But he’s organizing it in every place.

629
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,250
Los Angeles one marriage, one in New York,
one in Philadelphia.

630
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:31,410
All like that he is organizing.

631
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:36,510
And here there were ten thousand people who
attended that wedding.

632
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:42,830
The boy, means Rama, was ten-year old and
the girl was eight-year old.

633
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:47,490
So this kind of nonsense, even Indians, they
would not do this in India.

634
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:51,470
No, everybody will laugh at them.

635
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,240
The another example if I give, you’ll be
shocked.

636
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,900
There’s a lady, Maharani of Dhrangadhra
. She’s another mad woman and she has lost

637
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,900
her husband.

638
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:07,740
So she has got one man, she dressed him up
as a lady, and she calls him as “the goddess”

639
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,790
she worships.

640
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,370
I was shocked at the whole thing that they
are doing.

641
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,360
So I said, “But you don’t have anybody
who follows you.”

642
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:21,490
“No, no, we have many in Los Angeles.”

643
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,580
Can you imagine?

644
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:33,300
This there is another one now who makes the
pendulum move.

645
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,530
The people who are lynched by him, I met them
in Washington.

646
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:42,520
They told me, “Mother, we have sold out
our houses.

647
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,920
Now we don’t know what to do.

648
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,200
We have taken out our children from good schools.

649
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,470
We have no money.”

650
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,190
I said, “ So why?”

651
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,510
"There was this gentleman from the TM, you
see.

652
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,840
Pradeep Chopra is the name."

653
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,740
Pradeep, to have such a nice name, I don’t
know who gave him this name.

654
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,080
What his mother must have thought.

655
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,200
So he said that, “Now, I can control the
minds of others, I’ll teach you how.”

656
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,990
So he calls somebody.

657
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:09,970
“Stand here” and he gives you a pendulum
in his hand.

658
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,650
Now he says, “See, now he’ll move the
pendulum.”

659
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:22,760
He moves the pendulum and people have given
up their houses, this, that, to this man.

660
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,390
So I said, “How can you come and tell Me
this now?

661
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:31,660
Have you come on this earth to move the pendulums?”

662
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:40,040
I mean, this kind of stupidity, can’t understand.

663
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:50,290
Then they said you can levitate three or four
feet like this.

664
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,660
Already you have jams on the road.

665
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,630
Why do you want to have such people moving
their three feet?

666
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:02,690
Such stupid things they accept, such stupid
things.

667
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:07,940
But the fellow of TM, the one who was their
very big master, he got epilepsy, so he came

668
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,940
to me.

669
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,440
By that time, he had become bankrupt.

670
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,849
He told Me: “I went to America and my guru
told me, your money is so much involved, so

671
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:20,200
you have to tell then, I came without any
visa, without any passport.”

672
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,110
His name is Peter Pierce.

673
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:28,390
“And you have to tell them I can walk into
the wall, through the wall."

674
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,390
"Then?"

675
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,390
I said.

676
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:33,670
"I told them and they all believed me.”

677
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,590
“They all believed you?”

678
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,590
“Yes.”

679
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,460
“Professors, mathematicians, everybody believed
you?”

680
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,460
“Yes.”

681
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,880
How can they believe such nonsensical things?

682
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:56,170
There is a saying by Guru Nanaka, “Satguru
wahi, jo sahib mili hai.”

683
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:06,770
“The one who is the real master is the one
who makes you meet God, who makes you Divine.”

684
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,600
And this is what you should expect.

685
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,080
It looks difficult, is the easiest thing to
be Divine.

686
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,100
You don’t have to jump, you don’t have
to waste money.

687
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,540
Nothing of the kind.

688
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,710
It’s all built in within you.

689
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,050
Just have your awakening and enjoy.

690
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:28,890
You don’t have to do anything like running
away from your homes, going to Himalayas,

691
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:29,890
standing on your heads.

692
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:30,890
Nothing needed.

693
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:31,890
No austerities.

694
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,270
You are already ready for it.

695
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:36,220
You have done all this in your last lives.

696
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,640
Now please don’t do all these things.

697
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,090
You just get your Self-realization.

698
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:44,300
So you become collectively conscious.

699
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:51,350
You can feel on your fingertips vibrations
of another person, whether dead, living, or

700
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,140
historical whatever it is.

701
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,010
You can know.

702
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,580
You know the absolute truth on your fingertips.

703
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:07,310
But above all, because you become collectively
conscious, that is, a microcosm becomes the

704
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:12,400
macrocosm, because a drop becomes the ocean.

705
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,520
Who is the other?

706
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,040
You become the part and parcel of one.

707
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:28,460
So when it happens to you, it is very amazing
how you realize what powers you have.

708
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:35,370
You can give realization to people, you can
cure them, you can enjoy yourself.

709
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,850
You never get bored.

710
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:46,500
So many powers you have which starts expressing
and when they start expressing, you’re amazed

711
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,500
at yourself.

712
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:52,500
This is what you must expect and not moving
of a pendulum.

713
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:57,630
I’m sure today I’m not talking to stupid
people.

714
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,156
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiotic people,
I must tell you.

715
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:13,470
The kind of idiocity that has come I can’t
understand, because I used to worship Abraham

716
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:20,290
Lincoln, used to worship and he gave us such
a great thing like democracy and how can this

717
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,050
democracy be a demonocracy?

718
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:35,350
There are seekers, but misled.

719
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:46,010
Above all that happens to you, the highest
is that you jump into the ocean of joy…you

720
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:49,790
just become joy.

721
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:53,580
Joy is singular.

722
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:59,710
Happiness and unhappiness are the two sides
of one coin.

723
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:05,640
But joy is singular that you become the witness
the whole thing like a drama.

724
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:15,800
It’s fun and you get out of your problems
and that’s how you know how to solve them.

725
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:20,192
And above all, the bliss is there to help
you.

726
01:04:20,192 --> 01:04:23,860
You’ll be amazed how things work out.

727
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:28,370
Meticulously in every way, even money-wise.

728
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:33,200
There was a girl, lady from Toronto.

729
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,390
She wanted to travel with me, come here.

730
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:40,520
She’s very good, but she thought she hasn’t
got sufficient money and next day she got

731
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:48,230
a check of $4,000 because she had paid some
money somewhere a long time back.

732
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:54,410
This is just a very, very minimum.

733
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:59,350
But the greatest thing is that you become
your own master.

734
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:04,320
You know what chakras are there, you know
what you are doing.

735
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,750
You know everything.

736
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:12,720
It is not just like standing and moving a
pendulum nonsense but it is you know what’s

737
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,720
wrong with anyone.

738
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:20,700
Then you don’t talk about his face, about
his dress, how he walks but you talk about

739
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:27,030
his centers, what centers are there and you
can cure.

740
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,340
All this is your own.

741
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:38,210
Last of all I have to tell you this Kundalini
is the power of pure desire and she is your

742
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:42,470
individual mother.

743
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:44,210
She knows everything about you.

744
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,500
It’s all tape-recorded.

745
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,580
So you don’t have to start judging yourself.

746
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:54,330
She knows you and She is anxious to give you
self-realization.

747
01:05:54,330 --> 01:06:02,100
She takes up all the trouble on Herself and
gives you this beautiful thing which you call

748
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:13,090
as self-realization and then you realize that
you are endowed with the power of Divine love.

749
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:21,440
You become extremely dynamic; at the same
time you are extremely compassionate.

750
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:31,200
You enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your love,
you enjoy others, you enjoy everything.

751
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,620
Such a state is not difficult.

752
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:44,890
Only thing you must understand that you are
here to become the Spirit.

753
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:49,730
In this time try to say whatever is possible.

754
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:52,080
I’m going tonight to New York.

755
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,840
They always put me like a shuttlecock from
one place to another.

756
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,330
So I have to go.

757
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:01,390
But I’m very happy I saw so many of you
here.

758
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:07,400
I hope you’ll be all responsible and will
look after your realization.

759
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:20,340
Now I would request you that it cannot be
forced on you, it cannot be, because I respect

760
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,460
your freedom.

761
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,460
You have freedom.

762
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,560
This is the Last Judgment: If you want to
go to Heaven, you are welcome, if you want

763
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,130
to go to hell, you are welcome.

764
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:34,550
I cannot force on you.

765
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:43,220
So those who do not want to come for this
or do not want to have it, I cannot force,

766
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:48,110
so I would request you, those who do not want
to have, can leave the hall.

767
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:53,380
Would be better for others and those who want
to have it are welcome and I’m sure you

768
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,380
all will have it.

769
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,320
No doubt about it.

770
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,520
No doubt.

771
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:08,310
It will take hardly ten minutes for you to
get your realization, ten minutes.

772
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:17,500
But you have to be little patient and you
have to also know that it is your pure desire

773
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,500
that is going to give you.

774
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,089
Just your pure desire.

775
01:08:24,089 --> 01:08:28,540
I’ve already told you that Kundalini knows
everything about you and you don’t have

776
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:32,280
to judge yourself.

777
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:39,670
So there are three conditions, very simple,
very, very simple.

778
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:46,609
The first one is that you are not to feel
guilty at all.

779
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:49,080
Your Kundalini knows everything.

780
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,480
Why should you feel guilty?

781
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,130
Leave it to Her.

782
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,130
You don’t judge yourself and please don’t
feel guilty.

783
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:04,850
You don’t know if you feel guilty, this
center here, catches, and if this center goes

784
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:15,820
out of order, you develop angina which is
a horrible disease of the heart.

785
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:20,020
You develop spondylitis and also lethargic
organs.

786
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:26,550
Only by one this center of yours, and it is
always there when you feel guilty.

787
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:31,190
If you have done anything wrong in the past,
you should have dealt with it that time.

788
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:34,380
What’s the use of carrying it here all the
time?

789
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,630
Also is conditioning.

790
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:44,260
For small, small things people start feeling
guilty, specially with this Catholic Church,

791
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,220
Christian churches.

792
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,089
You have to know that we are sinners, we are
not.

793
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:54,940
We are human beings and human beings can commit
mistakes.

794
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:03,600
You are not gods and at this juncture, if
you have guilt, how will the Kundalini rise?

795
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:10,340
If you are really guilty, you would have been
in jail, isn’t it?

796
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:15,630
I don’t know with this law here, if people
can go to jail even if they have done something

797
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:18,540
wrong, I have no idea.

798
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:24,870
I, somehow or other, I’m very apprehensive
about the LA laws you see.

799
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:29,610
They say it’s very funny.

800
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:32,510
All right, whatever it is.

801
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:40,880
Now God’s laws are extremely pure and He
loves you.

802
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,540
He doesn’t want you, to put you into any
trouble.

803
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:55,040
He loves you and loves you very much and He
wants you to enter into His kingdom to enjoy.

804
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:01,810
Now you’re just ready to get it.

805
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:06,250
So the first condition is that you are not
to feel guilty at all.

806
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:11,200
I assure you, you have done nothing wrong.

807
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:16,440
Is it possible to forgive yourself?

808
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,990
Thank you.

809
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:20,480
The second condition is even easier.

810
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,150
If you understand, logically.

811
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:37,360
If, I mean, the second condition is that you
have to forgive everyone, even without thinking

812
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,360
about them.

813
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,960
Just to say, “I forgive every one of them,”
finished.

814
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:48,300
Is very difficult but logically, I’ll tell
you, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

815
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,690
what do you do?

816
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:51,340
Do nothing.

817
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:58,340
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands and torture yourself while

818
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,670
the person who has tortured you, is very happy.

819
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:07,410
You go on torturing yourself because you can’t
forgive.

820
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,950
So just you have to say, “I forgive everyone.”

821
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:14,850
Don’t think about them also because that
will give you a headache.

822
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,851
Best is to forgive everyone.

823
01:12:15,851 --> 01:12:26,080
Once you forgive, then the Divine takes over
and works it out.

824
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,190
So now please forgive everyone.

825
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,570
Is there any problem?

826
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:34,830
All right.

827
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:44,970
The third condition is very simple is that
you have to take out your shoes.

828
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,750
That’s all.

829
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:52,470
You won’t believe, in London first time
I said, “Take out your shoes,” half of

830
01:12:52,470 --> 01:13:05,210
them walked out.

831
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:13,700
It’s difficult.

832
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:22,200
All right.

833
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:32,700
So first of all we’ll show you what we have
to do to nourish our centers.

834
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,570
Only for tonight, only for tonight.

835
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,130
You don’t have to do it.

836
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:45,710
Later on, as I told you that our centers are
here and all this is happening in a collective

837
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:46,710
way.

838
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,490
It’s not single person doing something at
home.

839
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,610
So you have to go there.

840
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:57,320
They’ll give you every instruction, everything,
every book, whatever you want.

841
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,620
Free, absolutely free.

842
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:04,750
But you must desire to grow and it will work
out.

843
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:10,860
Some people get it immediately in such a big
way and then they think they’re on top of

844
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,790
the world, but no.

845
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,070
You have to grow and you have to know everything
about yourself.

846
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:20,490
You have to know about Sahaja Yoga completely
in a full way.

847
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:27,420
You have to be a master and I tell you hardly
it takes one month to be.

848
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,110
You people are very intelligent and everything.

849
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:32,500
Just put your attention, it will work out.

850
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,630
All right.

851
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:42,860
So now we have to put our left hand on our
lap just.

852
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:50,640
(Mother speaks aside to someone in Hindi.)

853
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,080
Just now.

854
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,340
Left hand on your left lap, comfortably.

855
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,710
We are not to go to Himalayas, do anything
of the kind.

856
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,140
We have to be comfortable, that’s one thing.

857
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:04,969
Here sitting down, you’ll get your realization.

858
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:12,330
Left hand towards the photograph, we put here,
because they have objection for that, but

859
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:22,910
now you put towards Me, left hand towards
Me which is symbolically saying that you want

860
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:29,640
your self-realization because the left side
is the power of desire, mundane desire.

861
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:35,460
So you’re desirous, so you are putting the
hand towards Me, left hand, that’s all.

862
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,470
Now with the right hand, we have to nourish
our centers on the left-hand side.

863
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:43,120
Now they will show you how to do.

864
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,760
First we put our right hand on the heart.

865
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:57,840
In the heart resides the Spirit which is the
reflection of God Almighty.

866
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:07,830
If you become the Spirit then you become your
own master.

867
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:13,960
So you take your hand on the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

868
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:22,900
this is the center of your mastery which is
created by all the prophets.

869
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:27,200
You will know about it, everything.

870
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,190
Everything will be told to you.

871
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:37,720
You have to put both your feet apart from
each other because these are also two powers

872
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,610
on left and right.

873
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:46,830
Now please take your hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

874
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:57,110
This is the center for pure, Divine knowledge.

875
01:16:57,110 --> 01:17:06,400
Don’t get disturbed with this, it’s very
simple, is the center for the pure, Divine

876
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,460
knowledge to work out.

877
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:22,360
Now you take your hand back to the upper portion
of your abdomen, press it which is the center

878
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,830
of mastery.

879
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:33,230
Now please take your right hand on top of
your heart which is the center of the pure

880
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:35,810
Spirit.

881
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:40,920
Now please take your right hand in the corner
of your neck and shoulder and turn your head

882
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,920
to your right.

883
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,950
Now this is the center I told you about that
when you feel guilty, this goes out of order

884
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:57,350
and at this juncture you must keep this center
open by not feeling guilty at all.

885
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:06,690
Now you raise your right hand on top of your
forehead across and put down your head.

886
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:10,670
This is the center where you have to forgive
everyone.

887
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:16,760
This center is extremely constricted and if
you don’t forgive, it won’t open.

888
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,680
All your life you’ve tortured yourself and
if you don’t forgive now, you’ll have

889
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:30,430
to miss this great opportunity of getting
your self-realization.

890
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:37,290
Now take back your right hand on the back
side of your head and push back your head.

891
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:46,810
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

892
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:53,850
you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading
Divine power of love.

893
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:57,780
That we’ll do later after closing eyes,
but I’m just telling you how to do it.

894
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,980
Now stretch your palm.

895
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:02,130
This is the last center, very important.

896
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:08,770
Stretch your palm and put the center of your
palm on top of the fontanelle bone area.

897
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:10,150
Now please put down your head.

898
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,190
They forget this.

899
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:16,510
Please put down your head and push back your
fingers as far as possible.

900
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:20,660
Just push back, so there’s a good pressure
on the scalp.

901
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:30,180
Now please move your hand in such a way that
the scalp moves, clockwise, seven times.

902
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,710
Do it very slowly.

903
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,850
Put down your head, put down your heads.

904
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,760
Please put down your heads.

905
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,720
You must put down your head otherwise it doesn’t
work out better.

906
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,790
Put down your head.

907
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:41,830
Now push back your fingers.

908
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:43,730
Pushing back your fingers is important.

909
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:52,880
Push back your fingers outward, so that there’s
a pressure on the scalp.

910
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,930
Now move it slowly seven times, clockwise.

911
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:06,330
Don’t hold your head, push back your fingers.

912
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:08,570
Please push back your fingers.

913
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:09,700
That’s it.

914
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,550
That’s all we have to do.

915
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:18,010
Now, again, we put our feet apart from each
other.

916
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:28,820
Put the left hand on your left lap and put
the right hand on the heart.

917
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:33,540
Now please close your eyes and please don’t
open them till I tell you.

918
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:40,410
You can take out your spectacles, if you like.

919
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:55,521
Now when you put your hand on your heart,
you have to ask Me a question, very fundamental

920
01:20:55,521 --> 01:21:00,240
question about yourself: You can call Me Mother,
or Shri Mataji.

921
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:06,070
Here, you please ask Me a question, in your
heart, three times.

922
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,120
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

923
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:18,690
Ask this question three times in your heart.

924
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:29,270
I’ve told you that if you become the Spirit,
you become your own master.

925
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:35,630
So please take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

926
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:41,970
and press it hard and here you have to ask
another fundamental question about yourself.

927
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:48,570
Three times, please ask in your heart: “Mother,
am I my own master?

928
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:58,730
Mother, am I my own master?”

929
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:08,010
I have told you that I respect your freedom
so I cannot force pure, Divine knowledge on

930
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:09,010
you.

931
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:10,170
You have to ask for it.

932
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:17,920
So please take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

933
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:24,510
and here you have to say six times because
this center has got six petals.

934
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:43,900
You have to ask, please ask six times: “Mother,
please give Me pure, Divine knowledge.”

935
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:51,560
As soon as you ask for pure, Divine knowledge,
Kundalini starts rising upward.

936
01:22:51,560 --> 01:23:00,830
So we have to nourish our upper centers with
our full self-confidence.

937
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:06,490
So now please raise your right hand in the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left

938
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:15,640
hand side and here you have to say ten times:
“Mother, I am my own master.”

939
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:26,130
Please say it ten times: “Mother, I am my
own master.”

940
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:33,030
At the very outset I told you that you are
not this body, this mind, these emotions,

941
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:42,960
this intellect, these conditionings, this
ego, but you are the pure Spirit.

942
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:55,290
So now raise your right hand on top of your
heart and here please say twelve times with

943
01:23:55,290 --> 01:24:05,830
full self-confidence: “Mother, I am the
pure Spirit.

944
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:11,540
Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

945
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:25,610
This all-pervading power of Divine love is
the ocean of knowledge.

946
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:34,770
It is the ocean of blessings, it is the ocean
of compassion, but above all, it is the ocean

947
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:40,330
of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might
commit will be completely dissolved by the

948
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:45,490
power of this ocean of forgiveness.

949
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:50,980
So please forgive yourself and put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

950
01:24:50,980 --> 01:25:03,020
and turn your head to your right.

951
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:07,820
Here you have to say sixteen times: “Mother,
I am not guilty at all.”

952
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:17,520
Please say with full self-confidence, sixteen
times: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

953
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:24,750
I have already told you whether you forgive
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

954
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:31,280
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands and torture yourself.

955
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:39,230
Specially at this time if you do not forgive,
this center of agnya won’t open and the

956
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:41,370
Kundalini won’t be able to break through.

957
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:47,040
So I request you again and again, just forgive
everyone.

958
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:53,210
So now raise your right hand on top of your
forehead across and please put down your head.

959
01:25:53,210 --> 01:26:04,170
Here you have to say, from your heart, not
how many times: “Mother, I forgive everyone

960
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,250
in general.”

961
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:15,130
Please say it from your heart.

962
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:23,770
Now without feeling guilty, without counting
mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you

963
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:31,350
have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading
Divine power.

964
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:37,670
So please take your right hand back side of
your head and push back your head as far as

965
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,160
possible.

966
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:50,571
Here now you have to say again from the heart,
not how many times: “Oh, Divine power, if

967
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:59,850
I’ve done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly,
please forgive me.

968
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:16,180
Oh, Divine power, if I have done anything
wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive

969
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:18,720
me.”

970
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,580
Now the last center.

971
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:25,040
Please stretch your palm fully.

972
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:32,460
Now carefully put the center of your palm
on top of the fontanelle bone area which was

973
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,920
a soft bone in your childhood.

974
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:38,310
Now please bend your head as much as you can.

975
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:45,530
Now remember to stretch back your fingers
so there is a good pressure on your scalp.

976
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:48,380
Here again, I respect your freedom.

977
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:51,800
I cannot force self-realization on you.

978
01:27:51,800 --> 01:28:00,800
So you have to say seven times, moving the
scalp seven times, you have to say: “Mother,

979
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,390
please give me my self-realization.

980
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:06,950
Mother, please give me my self-realization.”

981
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:17,520
Now move the scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

982
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:52,260
(Mother blows into the microphone.)

983
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:56,550
Now please take down your hand.

984
01:28:56,550 --> 01:29:05,400
Open your eyes, slowly.

985
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:17,050
Now please put both the hands towards Me like
this and try not to think.

986
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:25,280
Now bend your head and see with your left
hand, right hand towards Me, the left hand,

987
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:34,000
you feel if there is a hot or a cold breeze,
like vibrations, coming out of your fontanelle

988
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,100
bone area.

989
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,560
Please put down your head.

990
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,750
Now please don’t put the hand on top but
little away.

991
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,740
Some people get it further away.

992
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:51,410
So please move your hand and see for yourself
if there’s a cool or hot breeze, like vibrations,

993
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:55,980
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

994
01:29:55,980 --> 01:30:02,040
Now if they’re not coming, you should say:
“Mother, please come through my head.

995
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,910
Mother, please come through my head.”

996
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:11,070
Please say thrice.

997
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,800
Umm.

998
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,400
Now please put the left hand like this, and
with the right hand try to see if there’s

999
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:27,400
a cool breeze or a hot breeze like vibration
coming from your fontanelle bone area.

1000
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:33,640
Now if you have not forgiven you, or if are
not yourself, or if you are not forgiving

1001
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:36,740
others, it will be hot.

1002
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,750
But now try to forgive.

1003
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,360
Forgive yourself and forgive others.

1004
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:45,730
It will cool down, I’m sure it will cool
down.

1005
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:52,330
Now once more only, please put your right
hand towards me and again put down the head

1006
01:30:52,330 --> 01:31:02,270
and with the left hand, please try to see
if there’s a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

1007
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,770
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

1008
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:12,590
This is the actualization of baptism.

1009
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:17,860
This is what is the Brahmarandhra Bheda that
they call it.

1010
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:22,910
Now it’s done.

1011
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:27,970
Don’t doubt.

1012
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:36,090
Now please raise both the hands towards the
sky and push back your head and ask any one

1013
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:39,200
of these questions, three questions, three
times.

1014
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:46,560
First one is: “Mother, is this the cool
breeze of the holy Ghost?”

1015
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:54,090
Or, you can ask: “Mother, is this the all-pervading
power of Divine love?”

1016
01:31:54,090 --> 01:32:01,860
Or you can ask: “Mother, is this the paramchaitanya
or ruh?”

1017
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:05,550
Ask any one of these questions three times.

1018
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:13,330
Take down your hands.

1019
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:16,780
Such cool is coming from you to Me now.

1020
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:20,810
Now don’t doubt that it’s air-conditioning
or nothing is not: air-conditioning is not

1021
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:24,480
in your head, is coming out of your head.

1022
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,690
So don’t doubt yourself.

1023
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:36,770
All those who have felt cool breeze or hot
breeze on your fingertips, on your palms or

1024
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:46,560
through your fontanelle bone area, please
raise both your hands.

1025
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,990
Aah!

1026
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:56,030
All Americans have got it!

1027
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:58,010
Aah!

1028
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:59,860
I bow to you, all saints.

1029
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:00,930
I bow to you.

1030
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:01,930
(To one person) You didn’t feel, sir?

1031
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:04,220
What’s the matter with you?

1032
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:08,740
You didn’t feel it, the cool breeze?

1033
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,960
No?

1034
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,860
You’re the only person.

1035
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,090
Why?

1036
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,670
Just put your hands; it will work out.

1037
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:26,500
Just put both the feet apart.

1038
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:33,640
Now?

1039
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,630
Are you a doctor?

1040
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:42,680
[Mother asks a yogi to work on him.]

1041
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,320
Anybody can see that.

1042
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:49,790
[I.e., see the vibrations, Ed.]

1043
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:54,430
It’s all right.

1044
01:33:54,430 --> 01:34:02,490
Now all those who have not felt, are there
any?

1045
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:06,420
One, two, three, four.

1046
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,370
(This one, two.

1047
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:18,550
Three, four is not in the cassette)
