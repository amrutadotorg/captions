00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:05.366
All these years

00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:15.285
I have been waiting for this day.

00:08:21.027 --> 00:08:28.566
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:40.199
so is a very important turning point

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:54.118
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.608
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

00:09:02.303 --> 00:09:07.729
And so now is a new change has to come

00:09:09.093 --> 00:09:13.067
and you can see the announcement.

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:31.435
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

00:09:32.913 --> 00:09:40.850
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

00:09:42.654 --> 00:09:45.999
We are collectively conscious.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:57.820
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

00:09:59.506 --> 00:10:06.354
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

00:10:09.302 --> 00:10:15.124
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:26.162
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:32.526
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:39.295
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:58.052
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

00:10:58.253 --> 00:11:02.060
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

00:11:02.337 --> 00:11:08.533
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

00:11:12.457 --> 00:11:22.414
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:29.044
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

00:11:29.245 --> 00:11:33.050
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:39.179
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.571
All the time they are helping you.

00:11:41.772 --> 00:11:45.640
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:49.931
they are using them at the right time.

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:58.734
Now be confident that you have powers.

00:11:58.935 --> 00:12:10.746
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:15.674
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:21.569
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:31.089
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

00:12:33.163 --> 00:12:38.786
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

00:12:38.987 --> 00:12:43.385
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

00:12:43.586 --> 00:12:48.279
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.952
and the new character is announcement.

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:59.452
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

00:12:59.772 --> 00:13:05.419
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:08.938
Now you have to all start talking about it,

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:12.703
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

00:13:12.904 --> 00:13:18.822
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:26.526
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

00:13:26.717 --> 00:13:30.552
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

00:13:30.753 --> 00:13:35.758
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:41.054
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:45.010
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

00:13:45.231 --> 00:13:49.140
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

00:13:49.341 --> 00:13:55.852
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

00:13:56.053 --> 00:14:02.268
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

00:14:02.469 --> 00:14:09.129
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:14.623
and very different type of people.

00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:21.892
Now that assumption has to be there.

00:14:22.386 --> 00:14:29.541
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

00:14:29.722 --> 00:14:35.176
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

00:14:35.377 --> 00:14:41.390
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:44.982
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

00:14:45.182 --> 00:14:52.313
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:56.787
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

00:14:56.988 --> 00:15:03.550
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:08.817
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

00:15:12.909 --> 00:15:23.338
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:25.633
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:28.731
now leave them in the water.”

00:15:28.932 --> 00:15:30.127
His attention was here and there,

00:15:30.328 --> 00:15:34.310
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:37.940
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

00:15:38.141 --> 00:15:42.531
and lasted for five days more after that.

00:15:42.732 --> 00:15:46.062
Then he was convinced.

00:15:48.003 --> 00:15:55.760
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

00:15:55.961 --> 00:16:00.154
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:04.008
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

00:16:04.209 --> 00:16:09.307
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

00:16:09.508 --> 00:16:13.764
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

00:16:13.965 --> 00:16:19.740
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:24.919
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:32.526
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.474
for your countries and for the whole world.

00:16:37.982 --> 00:16:41.101
Now, assume your powers.

00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:47.208
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:52.090
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:58.688
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

00:16:58.912 --> 00:17:04.049
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.460
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:11.624
Now you have to count your powers:

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.256
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:21.155
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

00:17:21.346 --> 00:17:26.543
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

00:17:26.744 --> 00:17:29.446
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

00:17:29.646 --> 00:17:33.491
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

00:17:33.692 --> 00:17:37.211
and how you are going to work out.

00:17:38.238 --> 00:17:44.996
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:50.590
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:54.878
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

00:17:55.079 --> 00:18:00.110
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

00:18:00.311 --> 00:18:03.341
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

00:18:03.542 --> 00:18:07.512
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

00:18:07.713 --> 00:18:11.158
that I have put many a times before
you people,

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:14.205
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

00:18:14.406 --> 00:18:17.001
Now don’t have diffidence.

00:18:17.202 --> 00:18:21.876
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:26.286
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

00:18:26.487 --> 00:18:28.835
This work is not going to be done
by special people

00:18:29.035 --> 00:18:32.786
because they are suffering from ego.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:36.551
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:43.465
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:47.787
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:52.393
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

00:18:52.594 --> 00:19:03.952
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

00:19:04.153 --> 00:19:07.720
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:11.498
any animal you could think of.

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:16.372
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:23.515
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:30.459
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.751
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

00:19:35.973 --> 00:19:38.704
So many letters of confessions come to me,

00:19:38.905 --> 00:19:42.818
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

00:19:43.019 --> 00:19:46.322
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

00:19:46.523 --> 00:19:50.573
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.935
I am a Maha Yogi.”

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.882
This is the confession you have to make.

00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:02.139
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.098
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:09.682
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

00:20:09.883 --> 00:20:14.821
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

00:20:15.022 --> 00:20:20.297
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

00:20:20.498 --> 00:20:27.501
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:37.443
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

00:20:37.644 --> 00:20:40.730
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

00:20:40.931 --> 00:20:42.956
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

00:20:43.157 --> 00:20:46.742
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

00:20:46.943 --> 00:20:49.019
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.837
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:55.903
running after something that is a mirage

00:20:56.104 --> 00:21:00.225
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:03.134
We have to openly say it, this thing.

00:21:03.335 --> 00:21:05.019
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.809
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.795
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

00:21:10.996 --> 00:21:16.792
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:22.371
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:25.284
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:28.529
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:33.476
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

00:21:33.677 --> 00:21:43.485
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:46.794
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:51.496
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

00:21:51.697 --> 00:21:56.008
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

00:21:56.209 --> 00:22:01.844
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

00:22:02.045 --> 00:22:07.001
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:13.192
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

00:22:13.393 --> 00:22:16.284
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

00:22:16.485 --> 00:22:22.258
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:22.459 --> 00:22:25.244
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

00:22:25.445 --> 00:22:29.987
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

00:22:30.188 --> 00:22:34.944
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:38.500
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:41.475
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

00:22:41.676 --> 00:22:45.856
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

00:22:46.057 --> 00:22:51.566
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

00:22:51.767 --> 00:22:57.835
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

00:22:58.036 --> 00:23:03.673
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

00:23:03.874 --> 00:23:08.429
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:14.585
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

00:23:14.786 --> 00:23:19.054
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

00:23:19.255 --> 00:23:24.356
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

00:23:24.557 --> 00:23:28.856
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

00:23:29.057 --> 00:23:32.276
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:34.495
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

00:23:34.696 --> 00:23:37.149
for every small little nonsensical things.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.367
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

00:23:39.568 --> 00:23:41.590
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:45.139
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.710
they are not going to come out.”

00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:52.287
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

00:23:52.488 --> 00:23:55.563
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

00:23:55.764 --> 00:23:58.649
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.932
You are not entangled with anyone.

00:24:01.133 --> 00:24:03.943
You are not any way attached to anyone.

00:24:04.144 --> 00:24:07.890
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:11.314
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

00:24:11.515 --> 00:24:14.288
your country and ultimately the world.

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:22.636
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

00:24:22.837 --> 00:24:25.981
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

00:24:26.182 --> 00:24:29.316
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:32.236
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:37.865
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:43.388
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

00:24:43.589 --> 00:24:45.884
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

00:24:46.085 --> 00:24:49.055
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

00:24:49.256 --> 00:24:51.557
But there is all knowledge within you.

00:24:51.758 --> 00:24:56.020
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

00:24:56.221 --> 00:24:59.153
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:03.104
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

00:25:03.305 --> 00:25:07.475
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:11.949
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

00:25:12.163 --> 00:25:17.014
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:21.268
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

00:25:21.449 --> 00:25:24.829
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.286
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

00:25:27.487 --> 00:25:31.288
But these are very, very mundane things

00:25:31.489 --> 00:25:34.739
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.446
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

00:25:39.647 --> 00:25:41.912
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

00:25:42.113 --> 00:25:44.468
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:47.940
whether you are a child or a grown up.

00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:52.155
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

00:25:52.356 --> 00:25:57.068
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

00:25:57.269 --> 00:26:00.147
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:03.063
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

00:26:03.264 --> 00:26:06.722
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

00:26:06.923 --> 00:26:11.650
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

00:26:11.851 --> 00:26:14.991
is a commitment and complete involvement.

00:26:15.192 --> 00:26:18.670
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:21.552
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

00:26:21.753 --> 00:26:25.058
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

00:26:25.259 --> 00:26:29.028
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:32.137
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:32.338 --> 00:26:34.631
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:34.832 --> 00:26:38.931
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

00:26:39.135 --> 00:26:42.290
The whole attention should be on that.

00:26:42.491 --> 00:26:47.115
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

00:26:47.316 --> 00:26:52.119
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.963
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

00:26:56.164 --> 00:27:01.034
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

00:27:01.235 --> 00:27:04.340
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:08.200
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:13.809
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.805
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

00:27:17.006 --> 00:27:21.739
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.389
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.586
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

00:27:27.787 --> 00:27:32.292
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

00:27:32.493 --> 00:27:35.777
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

00:27:35.978 --> 00:27:40.592
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

00:27:42.287 --> 00:27:49.586
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

00:27:49.787 --> 00:27:53.734
because attention which was involved
into negative things

00:27:53.935 --> 00:27:59.231
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:59.432 --> 00:28:03.656
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

00:28:03.857 --> 00:28:06.827
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:09.407
then we should think that you are still
backdated

00:28:09.608 --> 00:28:16.545
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

00:28:16.746 --> 00:28:21.118
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:28.141
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

00:28:28.342 --> 00:28:33.087
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:38.423
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

00:28:38.624 --> 00:28:46.154
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:48.921
You just experiment and see for yourself.

00:28:49.122 --> 00:28:51.773
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

00:28:51.974 --> 00:28:54.832
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:58.439
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.634
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

00:29:03.835 --> 00:29:05.919
Now those days are gone!

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.918
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:16.617
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

00:29:16.818 --> 00:29:28.143
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

00:29:28.344 --> 00:29:31.154
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:31.355 --> 00:29:34.467
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:37.011
You can eat the way you want to eat.

00:29:37.212 --> 00:29:42.239
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:51.310
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

00:29:51.511 --> 00:29:55.170
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

00:29:55.371 --> 00:30:00.107
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

00:30:00.308 --> 00:30:03.585
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

00:30:03.786 --> 00:30:08.281
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

00:30:08.482 --> 00:30:14.723
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

00:30:14.924 --> 00:30:18.353
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

00:30:18.554 --> 00:30:22.501
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

00:30:22.702 --> 00:30:26.982
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

00:30:27.183 --> 00:30:29.433
and we have to work it out that way.

00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:32.417
Today we have here people from all over
the world

00:30:32.618 --> 00:30:35.738
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:39.876
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

00:30:40.077 --> 00:30:45.157
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:52.859
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

00:30:53.089 --> 00:30:57.099
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.278
May God bless you all.

00:31:12.917 --> 00:31:15.636
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

00:31:15.837 --> 00:31:18.282
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

00:31:18.483 --> 00:31:20.900
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:24.406
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

00:31:24.607 --> 00:31:29.697
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

00:31:29.898 --> 00:31:34.076
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

00:31:34.277 --> 00:31:38.537
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

00:31:38.738 --> 00:31:44.321
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:49.721
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

00:31:49.922 --> 00:31:57.249
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

00:31:58.279 --> 00:32:03.766
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

00:32:03.974 --> 00:32:10.255
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.076
But only thing what you need is a courage

00:32:15.277 --> 00:32:21.198
and a complete commitment to go forward

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:28.634
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
