00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.160
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.160
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.720
You have to rise above,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.640
and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.960
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.680
It's nice I don't possess them.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.480
See now these carpets are spread here.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.880
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.640
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.760
I hope nobody sits on them.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.720
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.360
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.080
Other people's things is a better idea.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.040
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.800
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.680
or they are their possessions.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760
Their Spirit is lost,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.040
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.880
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.160
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.800
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.440
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.960
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.440
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.320
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.040
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.480
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.200
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.680
is that a mental idea

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.320
that everybody must appreciate,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.040
and that you should be able to overpower others.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.160
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.960
Is a kind of a feeling

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.560
that you should be able to overpower many people,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.880
they should look at you.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.360
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.760
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.480
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.440
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.480
Because you look attractive, but for what?

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.600
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.720
Horrible they are. They create only pity

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.800
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.320
Once a beauty queen came to see Me.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.000
I thought she was a T.B. patient.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.120
And I said, “You look all right but

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.320
it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.600
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.320
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.680
because they want some patients there.”

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.360
This is the trouble,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.320
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.520
not to eat your food, fasting.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.520
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640
Thank you very much. No food.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.240
Fasting? All right,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.000
you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.400
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.480
And even if you want to fast

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.400
because you want to change the timing or maybe

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.160
for your health's sake, it's all right.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.240
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.240
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.720
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.960
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.880
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.600
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.320
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.720
when you fast like mad.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.880
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.440
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.160
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.680
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.040
because if you want to trouble your Mother

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.160
or to make Her uneasy, or to take a revenge on Her,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.280
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.440
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.360
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.640
So this kind of a mad fasting

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.800
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.800
then you have a problem because you are invaded

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.800
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.800
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.440
and you are invaded by them.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.800
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.560
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.760
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.200
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.400
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.080
so they are very angry for that part.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.120
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.680
You have to be normal people.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.240
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.680
Nothing. Be normal. Be nice people.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.480
Don't torture yourself.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.480
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.960
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.120
Don't pamper yourself.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.600
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.160
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.800
There is no difference between the two,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.560
because if you are not on the seat,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.840
whether you are on the left

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.480
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.880
So to be on the seat is to be

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.480
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.680
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.720
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.160
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.720
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.280
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.320
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.440
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.040
that She’s like a lotus.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.360
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.440
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.240
And even a horrible thing, like

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.320
wasp-like thing. I don’t know what you call it in English,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.120
you don’t have that black thing.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.120
We have a very black wasp, you see, which is hard,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.840
hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.200
That black thing comes in

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.600
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.160
for the residence, for the ashraya,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.320
the lotus keeps it

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.960
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.640
with all love.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.880
And in the night it closes down so that

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.040
the poor insect who is just like a nut

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.040
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.280
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.960
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.240
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.160
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.320
then they may open their doors.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.920
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.720
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.480
they are not there.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.600
On the other side are the people

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:42.560
who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.640
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.200
that they stink of miserliness.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.040
While the lotus gives its fragrance

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.440
through that mud, to that horrible thing

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:07.440
that even the little worms which crawl upon

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:15.560
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.360
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.560
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.880
It has to be welcoming.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.360
Then another hand is giving.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.280
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.160
She just gives.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.120
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.240
you don’t want to have anything from anyone. You don’t receive.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.680
If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.240
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.520
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.120
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what will you give?

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.040
You cannot give anything.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.800
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.840
he’s still a beggar.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.880
All of these so-called rich people who still are hankering money

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.160
are still beggars, they are not rich.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.760
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.280
because they are still expecting money.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.680
So, it is important that we should understand,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.440
the money is not the way.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.800
Money takes us away from dharma.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.560
It takes us away from God. It takes us away from reality.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.080
It covers our eyes. We don’t think

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.480
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.400
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.880
We can even purchase Him and can

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.920
manage Him by giving some bribes.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.640
That’s not so.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.520
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.240
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:22.200
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.640
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:33.320
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.640
Vishnu, is the Satya.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.480
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.520
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.880
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.200
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.000
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.880
They can only go to Narayana Puja

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.760
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.480
for camouflaging, is meant for these

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.680
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.480
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.120
They can have Narayana Puja.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.440
And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.640
In the Nabhi Chakra

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:32.280
Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.880
And It looks after

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.040
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.840
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.520
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:59.120
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.560
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.280
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.320
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.760
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.000
in the central path of Sushumna.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:35.360
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.040
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.320
When the Kundalini does not rise,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.760
this path is kept absolutely black.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.720
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.480
except for the deities

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.200
who are lying without any light.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.840
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.720
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:15.320
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.400
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.
