00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:23.207
I am so very filled with joy

00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:32.943
 and My heart is so full of gratitude for

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.657
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.836
to create this beautiful place.

00:00:44.513 --> 00:00:52.190
 I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

00:00:52.574 --> 00:01:01.364
 in such a place to create such  a beautiful

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:09.350
 area, such a blissful place.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:25.018
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.208
 with tremendous respect and love for each other,

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.397
and produce something that is unbelievable.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.955
This was just a wilderness,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.308
and you have brought so much of

00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:52.815
life and light in this place.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.323
 You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:12.751
 I don't know what is such a significant about it.

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:19.569
 But the way you have really

00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:23.945
 shown your understanding and respect,

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:29.576
I am just enamored.  I can't  understand

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:32.497
 what have I done for you, that

00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:35.894
you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:44.953
 As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:48.418
 which we call as the Holi.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:55.201
They play Holion this day and show their love

00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:59.564
 and oneness among themselves.

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:03.776
This is the time when we have to

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:09.022
really understand the value of love,

00:03:09.892 --> 00:03:14.318
of respect of others,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:21.594
 because so far we have based all our theories and

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:27.958
 all our ideas on the principle that human beings

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:35.568
cannot love each other: they are always trying to overpower others

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:40.256
 or to hate others, or to grab things from others.

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:44.877
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.131
 and that's why all the organizations that were created

00:03:49.304 --> 00:03:52.901
to obstruct it also got contaminated with it.

00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:03.336
The only way one can really understand

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:08.154
what we are is by knowing yourself.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.142
When you know yourself you are surprised that

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.751
what is the greatest thing for you is to love and to be loved.

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:23.399
 You enjoy that collective love so much

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:29.636
 when you are absolutely overcome

00:04:30.097 --> 00:04:36.856
 your baser self. In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:39.544
It works in a very simple manner.

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:47.733
 It's very Sahaja, but to grow into it is very important,

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:52.105
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:57.736
 from all over the world, from Delhi and also from all over India,

00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:01.624
 enjoying that love among yourselves

00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:05.148
and understanding among yourselves.

00:05:07.502 --> 00:05:10.996
I never expected that in My lifetime

00:05:11.283 --> 00:05:14.018
I'll be able to see all this beautiful

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:18.669
world of love, trust and peace.

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:23.336
 But today really I must say it shows

00:05:23.645 --> 00:05:27.634
 what we are capable of doing.

00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:36.314
 We human beings, so-called, are very selfish, self-centered

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:40.361
and only worried about ourselves:

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:45.470
that is what is said; but it's surprising

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:50.142
 that with Self-Realization, with self-knowledge,

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:55.621
 with knowing yourself, you understand how rich you are within,

00:05:56.002 --> 00:06:00.460
 how great you are within and how capable you are.

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:03.703
 This understanding comes to you,

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.700
 and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

00:06:10.351 --> 00:06:15.310
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:22.539
 and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:29.046
 But today I must say that it has reached such a height

00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:35.086
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:40.670
 When you know yourself, when you know what is reality

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.310
and what is absolute truth,

00:06:43.478 --> 00:06:47.779
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.428
 Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

00:06:56.174 --> 00:07:00.164
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:07.555
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:11.507
There's a big power of understanding.

00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:17.251
 There's a big power of understanding,

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.108
 a big power of oneness, of collective.

00:07:22.618 --> 00:07:25.973
This collectivity works wonders

00:07:26.164 --> 00:07:30.052
and gives such joy that we are all one,

00:07:30.397 --> 00:07:35.535
 we have no enemies, we have no problems.

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:39.748
 We are all one together.

00:08:08.948 --> 00:08:14.314
 This joy that was expressed by you

00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:23.245
 is like the waves that go to the shores,

00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:28.720
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.571
And I see that happening now,

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.490
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

00:08:37.713 --> 00:08:40.873
 in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:47.136
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:57.216
 I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:06.482
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:10.056
and enjoy it with others.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.150
 It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

00:09:16.738 --> 00:09:19.626
that's only human beings can do.

00:09:19.897 --> 00:09:23.103
 There can be a diamond, very expensive,

00:09:23.357 --> 00:09:25.608
 but it doesn't know its value.

00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:30.260
There could be some dog or some animal

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:33.622
which must be something par excellence,

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:36.543
but he doesn't know what he is.

00:09:36.832 --> 00:09:40.427
Same thing happens with the human beings

00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:43.355
till they get their Self-Realization,

00:09:43.577 --> 00:09:50.622
 and after Realization they suddenly become aware of what they are.

00:09:51.638 --> 00:09:57.493
 And then suddenly they become very humble, they become very loving.

00:09:58.013 --> 00:10:01.520
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:07.586
 or he discovers that he is a some great musician or a

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:13.798
 prime minister or something: he feels very aloof

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:17.452
and he thinks no end of himself.

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:21.380
 But by this knowledge that you have,

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:26.740
 you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

00:10:26.973 --> 00:10:30.681
 It's very remarkable how it works out

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:34.343
 that you enjoy each other so much,

00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:39.357
and to do something for this collective work,

00:10:39.548 --> 00:10:43.495
you can dedicate yourself to it.

00:10:44.715 --> 00:10:50.312
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

00:10:50.702 --> 00:10:54.842
 has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

00:10:54.968 --> 00:10:59.550
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

00:11:00.215 --> 00:11:05.068
And it's a good vision to see

00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:08.962
 before your eyes that despite all that,

00:11:09.153 --> 00:11:12.494
so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:18.487
 and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:21.702
 so colorful, so attractive.

00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:30.292
 All this is because we have a innate  value system,

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:35.898
 because we have inborn within us a great

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:43.610
 sense of love and compassion.

00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:49.283
 This compassion has to be really

00:11:50.513 --> 00:11:56.717
understood and enjoyed, and jump in the ocean of compassion.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.977
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

00:12:01.295 --> 00:12:04.151
 that automatically you'll swim,

00:12:04.477 --> 00:12:09.445
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

00:12:09.798 --> 00:12:13.610
 and without any problems, without any troubles,

00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:20.669
 all enjoying the bliss of this love,
 this compassion, this Divine love.

00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:27.730
 I must really congratulate

00:12:27.976 --> 00:12:33.182
 the Delhi people for coming up so well

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:40.048
with this beautiful arrangement  and this beautiful pendal,

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:45.993
and all the beautiful arrangements
they have made outside for your stay.

00:12:46.192 --> 00:12:48.890
 I mean really it's something,

00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:54.194
 I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:58.035
How these people have worked together:

00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:01.424
 there have been no quarrels, fighting,

00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:05.513
 backbiting, nothing of the kind. It's very surprising

00:13:05.894 --> 00:13:09.601
 that such a beautiful thing has been created by them:

00:13:09.927 --> 00:13:13.766
 shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.590
 I must congratulate them again and again

00:13:17.876 --> 00:13:20.391
for doing this great work

00:13:20.918 --> 00:13:23.430
in such a short time.
 

00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:26.976
First I talked in English because

00:13:27.001 --> 00:13:29.700
here many people have come from foreign countries

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.161
and you don't have any objection

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.955
that I talk in English for a little while.

00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:39.696
Although it is a great thing of Dehlites

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:45.251
and along with them the people of Uttarpradesh also joined.

00:13:45.787 --> 00:13:52.933
People of Rajasthan also joined and the people from Haryana also helped.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:57.051
All of them have collectively made with love this

00:13:57.076 --> 00:14:00.539
very beautiful pandal like a temple.

00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:06.338
On seeing it I was Myself surprised

00:14:07.032 --> 00:14:10.623
that here are such talented artists.

00:14:10.648 --> 00:14:12.581
I didn't know.

00:14:12.606 --> 00:14:15.246
Wherefrom this art came?

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:21.045
How did they make it and decorate all this, I can't understand.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:27.529
I didn't know that there are artists of such caliber in our country

00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:30.247
and that too caliber of love.

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:34.686
The power of 'love' and the art of 'love'

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:38.446
the art of loving everybody

00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:43.418
whosoever will get it, he only can do such an artistic composition.

00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:46.430
One should learn this art

00:14:46.455 --> 00:14:54.285
how can we with the help of our speech, mind and wisdom

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.096
become artists, artists of 'love'

00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:03.824
and how can we give comfort to others

00:15:03.849 --> 00:15:06.687
and joy to others.

00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:11.477
Which lovable talk is such that we can do.

00:15:11.502 --> 00:15:13.777
One it is with the help of speech

00:15:14.017 --> 00:15:18.390
then with wisdom how can we think?

00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:22.997
How can we shower our love among people?

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:30.137
How can we open our heart in front of others

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:33.803
and establish them in our heart?

00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:41.129
And we should think that the heart which doesn't have love

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:45.307
he is not an authority of anything in the world.

00:15:45.917 --> 00:15:52.010
Because whatever he gets, he cannot be contented in any way with that

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:54.435
he cannot get contentment.

00:15:54.554 --> 00:16:00.716
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:05.685
what is it that cannot content you?

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:12.900
When it happens within you and you get the solution

00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:21.064
then, nobody can understand the boundries of that solution

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:24.108
that nobody can understand this business.

00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:29.866
Such melodious and such beautiful all that happens

00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:32.067
you cannot overlook it.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:37.796
Can't understand what i am doing and what others are doing

00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:40.646
what they are saying and what i am saying.

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:46.365
And how are they covering me with their love

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:54.135
and how shall we shower them with our love.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.746
Day and night the same worry goes on

00:16:56.913 --> 00:16:59.379
that today whom I have to meet

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:03.325
and what loving things should I tell them.

00:17:03.744 --> 00:17:07.208
What useful things should be talked about.

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:12.275
Because the practice of talking about useless things

00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:13.871
leads only to loss.

00:17:14.077 --> 00:17:15.771
It has never been useful

00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:21.061
and more than that the anger that is there in a human being

00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:24.223
leads to all the more complications.

00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:29.865
There was no need to teach you not to do violence

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.067
don't treat anyone badly

00:17:34.092 --> 00:17:36.620
don't destroy anyone

00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:38.489
don't grab somebody's money.

00:17:38.514 --> 00:17:40.398
There is no need to teach all this.

00:17:40.423 --> 00:17:44.127
You became so dignified on your own.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:48.431
I said now you too have become lotuses

00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:51.781
that you know to give only your fragrance

00:17:52.211 --> 00:17:53.822
and don't know anything else.

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:57.528
And the joy of giving to others

00:17:57.553 --> 00:18:04.005
and to feel its joy is a strange experience.

00:18:04.061 --> 00:18:08.144
Only people of unique character can do it.

00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:12.344
Now you are the masters of it

00:18:12.369 --> 00:18:18.082
and the heritage that we had kept with you

00:18:18.345 --> 00:18:21.324
you have utilized fully.

00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:23.744
Now that thing is open to everyone

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.935
it didn't harm anyone.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.479
Now it is a matter of enjoyment.

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:32.859
Many people in the world are of different types

00:18:32.884 --> 00:18:35.560
but they cannot touch you

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.376
cannot bother you.

00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:43.702
Even if there can be something, that too may be absorbed by you.

00:18:43.727 --> 00:18:45.302
let them join you.

00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:47.871
Watching your lifestyle

00:18:47.896 --> 00:18:54.086
let them have atleast the inclination to change their life.

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:56.030
Let us also change.

00:18:56.055 --> 00:18:57.475
I don't say that

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.760
I have signed the contract of changing this whole world

00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:05.556
but you can sign this contract.

00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:08.232
If you will change this world

00:19:08.257 --> 00:19:14.182
If you invite moral, kind and gentle people

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:20.384
there is no need to do anything more.

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:24.009
then you go on looking at it.

00:19:24.034 --> 00:19:29.584
The only important thing is that you get attatched to it

00:19:29.944 --> 00:19:35.013
Get engaged into it and find out how many people can we transform?

00:19:35.038 --> 00:19:39.827
I agree that an ordinary man has got a number of flaws.

00:19:39.852 --> 00:19:44.819
A man full of flaws you can

00:19:44.844 --> 00:19:52.830
very beautifully give knowledge of a good and unknown self

00:19:52.855 --> 00:19:54.909
the self within us.

00:19:54.934 --> 00:20:01.093
When you come into contact with the spirit inside us

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.374
you come to know that others too must do so.

00:20:06.399 --> 00:20:07.748
know yourself all the more.

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:09.269
They are lost.

00:20:09.294 --> 00:20:14.243
They don't know how much prime wealth they have inside them.

00:20:14.326 --> 00:20:16.710
So, they must be given it

00:20:16.735 --> 00:20:19.607
and they must get it.

00:20:19.632 --> 00:20:23.116
When such conversations will start taking place

00:20:23.141 --> 00:20:26.154
you will take its responsibility on your ownself

00:20:26.503 --> 00:20:30.999
that we too should give others this prime wealth.

00:20:31.024 --> 00:20:33.758
Their keys are with you

00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:41.097
and if you somehow give this great contribution

00:20:41.122 --> 00:20:45.433
just watch how they will recognize you

00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:49.546
and how they will be greatful to you.

00:20:50.038 --> 00:20:52.788
The greatest work for you now is that

00:20:52.813 --> 00:20:57.354
you bring as many people as you can to Sahaja state

00:20:58.047 --> 00:20:59.662
and give them this wealth

00:20:59.687 --> 00:21:04.279
and when this will happen

00:21:04.304 --> 00:21:06.965
you will yourself get busy and be happy

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:14.337
and a type of joy which cannot be described

00:21:14.521 --> 00:21:15.521
you will get.

00:21:16.132 --> 00:21:17.834
This has to be done.

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:21.339
Today you have celebrated My Birthday.

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:26.771
I should say a lot of thanks for that

00:21:26.796 --> 00:21:29.795
and you have done all this joyfully

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:36.940
but for Me it is so that every year Sahajyoga has been spreading

00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:42.105
and even I too cannot understand its boundries.

00:21:42.328 --> 00:21:46.292
But today you too must take a decision

00:21:46.317 --> 00:21:54.714
that on the birthday of Mother we will try to transform others.

00:21:54.739 --> 00:21:58.543
Our transformation has already been done but must do of others as well.

00:21:59.091 --> 00:22:04.783
This only  will give you complete contentment of this joy.

00:22:04.808 --> 00:22:07.408
Till now the joy you have is limited

00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:09.882
when you will distribute it among others

00:22:09.907 --> 00:22:12.611
and when it will be echoed in others

00:22:12.747 --> 00:22:19.893
when you will come to know about it, understand it

00:22:20.854 --> 00:22:28.469
a great new joy will awaken within yourself.

00:22:28.494 --> 00:22:37.737
I was watching your young boys, children dancing joyfully.

00:22:38.488 --> 00:22:43.912
Krishna got celebrated Holi so that everybody get joy.

00:22:43.937 --> 00:22:49.828
Shri Ram's style made a human being very serious type.

00:22:49.852 --> 00:22:52.293
His life became serious.

00:22:52.318 --> 00:22:55.468
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method so that a human being

00:22:55.493 --> 00:22:58.477
 cound open up himself and play mirthfully.

00:22:58.802 --> 00:23:02.865
Now that thing only Sahajyogis can do practically

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.702
can play Holi with love amongst themselves.

00:23:07.727 --> 00:23:11.146
Not to trouble others

00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:17.561
but to express their own joy and to make feel others joyous as well.

00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:20.759
Eternal blessings to everyone.
