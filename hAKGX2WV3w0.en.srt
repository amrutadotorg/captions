1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,750
So yesterday was a nice day for all of us, and I said something

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,500
of a different level.

3
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,375
We've been talking all the time

4
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,083
about the mundane things

5
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,792
and these things sometimes are very ...

6
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,999
are of so much importance, we think.

7
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,750
But when I talked to you yesterday,

8
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,999
I hope you all realized

9
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,291
that we have to now jump into

10
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:03,291
another realm of a subtler understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

11
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,500
First we are worried about

12
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,875
our families, our children,

13
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:13,208
our households;

14
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,667
then, our marriages.

15
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:24,375
One after another all these questions came up,

16
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,208
and we were concerned about all these things;

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,999
little, little things.

18
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,375
Then we also got concerned about the ashrams

19
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,917
which we were running:

20
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,999
the problems of the ashram,

21
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,625
what we have been doing,

22
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:46,417
how we have been facing the problems,

23
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,875
how people are creating problems.

24
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,208
That's how our humanity started

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,417
acquiring a subtler understanding.

26
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,999
And then we also realized that

27
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,041
we are blessed by God,

28
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,166
that there's something great

29
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,625
that is always looking after us,

30
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,792
some higher Force,

31
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:21,166
some special Attention is there about us.

32
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,875
This is what we realized.

33
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,417
Today I was explaining how it happens,

34
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,625
that how we realize

35
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,875
that God is helping us too.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,834
Any problem is an effect of some sort of a cause

37
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,333
- every problem.

38
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,709
Like Mona wrote a letter that she was driving

39
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,041
in a motorway

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,500
and the car went out of control,

41
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,333
and the brake would not act.

42
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,083
And there was a car coming from the right,

43
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,709
car coming from the left,

44
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,667
cars going through in front and behind.

45
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,125
And she felt that they'll be finished

46
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,458
- two of them were traveling, two Sahaja yoginis.

47
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:32,667
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

48
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:37,250
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,333
So now, how to overcome that problem?

50
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,792
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,

51
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,667
because cause is still there.

52
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,917
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

53
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,959
Then what to do?

54
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,125
So the easiest thing is to cross the cause,

55
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,709
to ascend over, to go beyond the cause;

56
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,792
so the cause does not exist for you,

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,959
so the effect does not exist for you.

58
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,542
As long as the cause exists in your attention,

59
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,667
the effect will be there.

60
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,792
So what did she do?

61
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,750
She just prayed to Me, just thought of Me that

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,667
"Mother, now it's my last chance" - that's all.

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,999
So the cause disappeared, because you go beyond it.

64
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,166
And the effect also disappeared, and she was surprised.

65
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:42,750
So you must ascend away from the cause.

66
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,750
Now a problem: "my wife is like this",

67
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,166
"my husband like this," "my family life is this,"

68
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:55,083
"Sahaja yogis are like this" - all kinds of things are there.

69
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:58,166
It's an effect. Now what's the cause?

70
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,375
- is such and such person.

71
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,959
All right, now what are we to get - relation of the cause.

72
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,875
Surrender it.

73
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,542
You are, you have the right to do that.

74
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,500
You have a knack to do it, you can do it.

75
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,875
You are capable of it, you are entitled to do it

76
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,625
- but you don't do it, you forget.

77
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,959
You just forget.

78
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,834
If you surrender that cause,

79
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,999
the effects will go away.

80
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,667
But that is the thing at that time to remember,

81
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,208
that you have to ascend.

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,875
To go beyond the cause is the best way to get rid of it.

83
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,375
So I've been playing with you.

84
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,792
You had causes to say,

85
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,999
"Oh Mother, this is the problem. I have no job."

86
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:52,417
Now I have a job, then the job is to be hard.

87
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,291
Then the wife is not there, so must have a wife.

88
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,667
The wife has a problem, so she is to be divorced

89
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,792
- and that and that, and this is that.

90
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,291
Then, "I am like that.

91
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,166
I am very bad because there's a bhoot in me."

92
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,083
So the bhoot is the cause.

93
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:13,792
"And I am behaving like this because there's a bhoot in me."

94
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,417
That's also a scapegoat, I think.

95
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:23,208
So first you go beyond that, saying,

96
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,291
"What is bhoot? Who is bhoot?

97
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,041
I know my Mother.

98
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:35,083
And Mother, You look after this bhoot of mine" - that's all.

99
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,333
But for that an emergency has to come to you,

100
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,417
otherwise you just don't do it, with that power.

101
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,792
When you are in emergent condition,

102
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,917
then it works out faster.

103
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:53,625
When it is not emergency then it's half-hearted,

104
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,041
like Mona's condition.

105
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,375
There was another case where a

106
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,166
journalist was traveling from ...

107
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:10,041
or something and his brakes broke down,

108
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,959
and he was with another journalist,

109
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,000
so both of them were coming - this another journalist told me.

110
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,166
The another one was Sahaja yogi.

111
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,500
So he found his brakes are not working

112
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:26,834
and he found his car is going,

113
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,125
in front there is a big truck coming up

114
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,375
and another truck coming from behind.

115
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,959
And there was no way for him to turn or to get out of it,

116
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,750
and his brakes were horrid.

117
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,125
That was a emergency, you see.

118
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,458
Such an emergency that developed into his mind,

119
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:45,041
that "Oh God, now the last moment has come.

120
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,458
Now we're finished."

121
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,166
There is a truck coming from there and another truck,

122
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,709
and within a split of a second he was to be finished.

123
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,834
And he just told his friend, "Think of Mother" - that's all.

124
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:01,959
And what he found, that he was nicely crawling on the road

125
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,709
and the trucks were left behind, and the brake was working.

126
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,625
But that emergency has to come.

127
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,917
Human beings are such that unless and until

128
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:18,041
they are put into tight corners, they never do that.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,125
Once they are in a tight corner, then they do it.

130
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,834
That is the reason why people try to take ascetic life,

131
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:30,250
because if you are an ascetic then you are in a tight corner.

132
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,375
They go to Gobi Desert to create that emergency within you,

133
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,959
so that you think of God.

134
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,041
But that's too late to go to the Gobi Desert.

135
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,500
They create problems for them to get into tight corners,

136
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,083
so that they can get out of it.

137
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:55,083
But for Sahaja yogis if they are wise, they need not have.

138
00:08:56,667 --> 00:09:02,000
But how do we achieve it otherwise, without any ... ?

139
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,417
Only way is meditation.

140
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,083
Everybody must meditate, it's the point.

141
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,208
If you do not meditate, you can continue for a while.

142
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,417
You may be all right for a while

143
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,125
for two, three months, maybe two years,

144
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,875
but then you drop out.

145
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,583
Many people think, "Oh, what's the need to meditate?

146
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,000
You see, it's all right.

147
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,208
If we don't meditate, doesn't matter." It's not so.

148
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,917
Because in meditation only you grow.

149
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,208
In emergency you suddenly grow, no doubt.

150
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,792
I mean, you jump like a jack-in-the- box.

151
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,083
You just come up with a spring.

152
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:46,083
But if you have to have continuous growth

153
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,208
then you must meditate,

154
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:55,709
allow the thoughts after thoughts coming,

155
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,709
and then allow them to subside,

156
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,667
because you rise into the state of thoughtless awareness.

157
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,999
And in that thoughtless awareness you grow.

158
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,291
And you grow in your detachment

159
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,917
to the cause of all the effects.

160
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,709
If there is no cause, there is no effect.

161
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,000
But this is the problem with us,

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,083
is that we do not meditate, normally.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,291
Only when it comes to absolute last point,

164
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:35,250
now you'll have to fall in the well - then we think of it.

165
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,125
Maybe at that moment you are helped,

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,083
but you don't grow.

167
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,542
Growth can only come if you meditate.

168
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,542
That is one very important part,

169
00:10:52,875 --> 00:11:01,208
is complete help to people who meditate in the normal way.

170
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,999
In the normal life, how do we grow?

171
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,792
If we have no oxygen, we cannot grow.

172
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,333
We have to have sufficient oxygen,

173
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,125
we have to have sufficient food,

174
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,083
we have to have all these things.

175
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,667
But in spirituality you grow through meditation.

176
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,125
There's no way out.

177
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,542
Those who think they can grow are bumptious,

178
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,417
actually bumptious people,

179
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,458
because they can talk a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

180
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,999
I have seen people who talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

181
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,417
They can give big lectures, this, that,

182
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,083
but have no vibrations at all.

183
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,083
They can't do any work for Sahaja Yoga,

184
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,291
they are not collective,

185
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,667
they have no sense to be collective,

186
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,250
all kinds of problems.

187
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:51,999
But the growth is to be achieved through meditation.

188
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,333
That is one part of it.

189
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:59,333
That is, we can say, is the worship, is the puja.

190
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,667
Then you don't have to give up anything,

191
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,458
you just become detached,

192
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:11,083
detached from the cause itself.

193
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,125
That's one part of it.

194
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,834
Secondly, that this I would say will

195
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,917
take you to the subtler side of your emotional bindings,

196
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:28,583
because emotional binding has given you

197
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,000
certain identification:

198
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,417
you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Muslim,

199
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:37,083
or this and that, or a British or any kind of a race,

200
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,250
or whatever you have to call it.

201
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,542
All those things will drop out,

202
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,417
because you get a detached personality.

203
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,250
So these emotional bindings - "he is my brother,"

204
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,917
"she is my sister," "I am worried about my wife,"

205
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,834
"I am worried about my child"

206
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:56,125
- all these emotional bindings which

207
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:02,999
make you a smaller personality will drop out,

208
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,917
and you'll have one emotional binding,

209
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:09,792
is that "I am growing in my compassion.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,125
Compassion is active, my compassion is effective.

211
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,000
My compassion is alight.

212
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,083
My compassion is this discretion.

213
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,709
I am a yogi."

214
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:34,125
And secondly you read about Sahaja Yoga,

215
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:36,250
you know about Sahaja Yoga,

216
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,083
you know the technique of Sahaja yoga,

217
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,834
you raise your kundalini,

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,875
you clean your chakras,

219
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,667
try to understand about mantras.

220
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,000
You master your mantras,

221
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,083
you master your deities,

222
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,333
you please them.

223
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:00,667
All these things when they are done properly,

224
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:04,583
then your mental bindings will drop out.

225
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,583
Those who think they are great scientists,

226
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,999
they will know that all this is no science;

227
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,709
the science of God's technique is much more.

228
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,959
Those who think that they are over-read,

229
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,375
well-read people, when they read about Sahaja Yoga

230
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,375
and work it out on themselves and see for themselves,

231
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,208
and on others,

232
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,417
they will know that whatever they have read is all stupid,

233
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,792
has no meaning, is empty.

234
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:37,500
And that's how a kind of an emptiness will come in,

235
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,999
emptiness of ego,

236
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,375
because they'll see that knowledge is so great.

237
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,083
Like Newton said that "Knowledge is like an ocean,

238
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,083
and I am like a little child

239
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,750
collecting some pebbles at its shore."

240
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,166
What an understanding!

241
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:01,500
So that emptiness comes in you,

242
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:05,417
and then the real knowledge starts coming into you.

243
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,750
The identification with real knowledge comes.

244
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,208
You talk;

245
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,375
when you talk, that talk has an effect - that's a mantra.

246
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,667
You just don't jabber,

247
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,208
"Oh, I am in Sahaja Yoga.

248
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,500
I have been in Sahaja Yoga for fifteen years"

249
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,417
- good for nothing.

250
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,625
You may be there

251
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,959
for a hundred years but you may remain a donkey as donkey is,

252
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,750
absolutely.

253
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,875
But you may have been there only for one year,

254
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,417
and you may become from a donkey a human being,

255
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,166
and a yogi too.

256
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,542
But that is what we have to first of all

257
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,792
recondition ourselves,

258
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:55,750
by attaching ourselves emotionally to Mother.

259
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,625
I mean, you have an advantage

260
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:04,875
over many other yogis of the world who came, poor things,

261
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,041
they had nothing to look forward.

262
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,500
They knew of a Primordial Mother, they knew about this,

263
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,999
but they had no Form.

264
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,667
You have a Form.

265
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,375
You are very fortunate and lucky people; you have a Form.

266
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,959
It's easy to adore a Form than to adore something abstract

267
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,291
in the air, do you see;

268
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,542
absolute consciousness,

269
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,625
how do you adore it when you can't see it?

270
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,208
But that attachment doesn't mean in any way

271
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,333
that you have to give Me anything.

272
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,625
What do you give Me?

273
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,333
Nothing, but detachment from the cause.

274
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,792
And this works out - you have seen it in your lifetime.

275
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,792
You also say that "It works out, Mother,

276
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,250
somehow it worked out."

277
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,917
What is bandhan?

278
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,125
It's nothing but you are attaching yourself to your Mother,

279
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,333
you're just telephoning to Her.

280
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,959
This is a telephone going to your Mother,

281
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,500
that's all.

282
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,583
You know I also play with you, I also say,

283
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,000
"All right, I am giving you a bandhan."

284
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,583
I am giving bandhan to Myself!

285
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,208
It's a telephone call,

286
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,083
just a telephone call.

287
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,834
But the faith has developed now that yes,

288
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,834
this is the real faith,

289
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:27,458
where you get completely detached in your emotional things.

290
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,667
It's just "My mother" - all right, just give her a bandhan,

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,959
finished. "My father" - give him a bandhan.

292
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,041
"My brother" - give him a bandhan,

293
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,625
whatever it is.

294
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,333
Bandhan, whatever it is.

295
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:41,208
You are putting that ... in the bonds of your Mother.

296
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,750
But you are not conscious that you are doing that.

297
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,959
You are just binding them with the love of your Mother

298
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,583
which is flowing through your hands.

299
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:53,959
What are these vibrations, is your Mother's love.

300
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,750
You've got it,

301
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,625
it is flowing through you.

302
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,542
But what about your love for your Mother?

303
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,083
And that is what I find,

304
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,875
that at the time when there is complete emergency

305
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:16,542
that surrender comes in, and it works.

306
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,959
So there's no need to create any emergencies.

307
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,417
You must slow and steadily work it out,

308
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,291
and it will build up by itself within you.

309
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,041
You will have that power within you, I assure you.

310
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,959
But meditation is one way;

311
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:39,041
another is the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

312
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,417
Not showing off, not telling others,

313
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:44,291
but working it out in yourself - different chakras,

314
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,542
how they work out,

315
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,166
on yourself, not on others.

316
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,542
Once you start teaching others, it's a bhoot in you.

317
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,999
You'd better learn it for yourself, even within yourself.

318
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:59,834
I know who has mastered which chakra, which ....

319
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,750
Nobody tell others that

320
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:06,500
"this is the way to do it," that's absolute nonsensical ego.

321
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,625
So such things should not be done.

322
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,166
If somebody asks you, you can tell

323
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:19,500
individually, but on a large scale you do not give lectures

324
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,834
on that, and don't confuse people.

325
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,834
Now, so we have two things,

326
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,083
that we have to get over our emotional

327
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:34,542
grossness and our mental grossness;

328
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,625
same with our physical grossness.

329
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,166
Physical grossness can be overcome

330
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,417
if you surrender yourself,

331
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,291
to one medicine, is vibrations.

332
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,542
Like Anupama, My grandchild, told her mother,

333
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,500
"You are born in allopathy,

334
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,625
then you are following homeopathy.

335
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,999
Tomorrow you'll find out some jumbopathy,

336
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,250
then some numbopathy!

337
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,959
So, but I am born in God

338
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,625
and I follow only God's pathy,

339
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,500
and God will look after me

340
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,834
and God will cure me."

341
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,291
So My daughter said, "Why? You may also change."

342
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,834
She said, "Why?

343
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:25,417
Because God never changes."

344
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:30,083
Simple answer: God will cure you.

345
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:36,999
But you must have that much ascent to say that,

346
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:40,375
as you just jump out at the time of emergency.

347
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,375
Same sort of an urge,

348
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,542
that same sort of a personality should be within you

349
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,959
to say that. Just if you say,

350
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,834
"Oh God, please save me,"

351
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,166
God has no time for such people.

352
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,999
You have no time for God, God has no time for you either

353
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,999
- a simple thing.

354
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,166
So from sublime to mundane things when we come,

355
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,417
we exist in both the things

356
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,083
and we are effective.

357
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:13,083
Whether we are in the lamp or in the light or in the oil,

358
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,375
we are at a subtler point;

359
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,834
and we,

360
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:21,625
if we give the effectiveness

361
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,542
without being the cause.

362
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,500
Because you are beyond the cause,

363
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:31,667
so there is no need to create any cause for anything,

364
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,291
but you see the effect.

365
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:39,542
So once the cause is finished effect is achieved,

366
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:43,166
and it's achieved what is to be achieved,

367
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,500
the correctness of it.

368
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,166
The correct thing you get.

369
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,083
You do not get perverse thing,

370
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,291
but if you go with a cause then you can have perversity,

371
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,417
you can have all kinds of problems.

372
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:58,417
So the best thing is to detach yourself from causes

373
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,208
and then you get the effect,

374
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,291
like as I told you that the brake got all right.

375
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,458
The effect was there,

376
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,917
the car was all right,

377
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,583
everything was fine so the effect was all right;

378
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,333
but the cause was lost.

379
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,458
There was no cause.

380
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,166
Why? How?

381
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,208
How the thing was perfected?

382
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,583
If you ask the effect of it, you say how did you get it?

383
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,458
You can't explain, it didn't work out.

384
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,709
So because the cause is missing

385
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,375
you cannot put it to any cause;

386
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,583
you sometimes say it's divine the way it's worked out.

387
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:42,250
So the only cause that is really effective is divinity.

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,750
But the divinity should not be just as

389
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,291
a mundane sort of a thing,

390
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:55,041
"All right, yes, Mother's photograph is there, namaste.

391
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,750
Good. Namaste. Good morning, Mother" - finished.

392
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,125
That's not the way.

393
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,375
You have to know your Mother,

394
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:06,375
and you have to love your Mother

395
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,500
- that is what it is.

396
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,417
It's very embarrassing to say that you must love Me.

397
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,291
But as a Mother in this lifetime

398
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,250
I have had many embarrassing things,

399
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,750
and one of them is this,

400
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,250
that I don't know how to tell the children.

401
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,709
Now this is the fact.

402
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,250
So you need not go through any emergencies

403
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,750
or any such problems.

404
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,250
You just develop yourself in such a way

405
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:39,375
that you are so developed that it just acts and works out.

406
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,625
So I'll give you a example of that.

407
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,375
It works the least in England,

408
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,750
surprisingly, where I've worked the most

409
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,750
- least in England.

410
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,750
I'll give you a simple example, now.

411
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,959
You see, your coming to India was decided

412
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,583
I don't know how many months back.

413
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:09,250
I have been to India once and I'm going second time,

414
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,000
and England is the only place

415
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
where you have to pay your money directly.

416
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,041
People have not yet paid,

417
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,000
but Australians have done it.

418
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,959
Australians, who are eighty, eighty-five people have done it,

419
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,625
but English have not done - everything they are slow.

420
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,166
But when it comes to ego they are the first,

421
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,959
their flags are the first.

422
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:34,250
In the ego, where is it generated? - in England the great.

423
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:39,709
So when it comes to doing something they are the slowest,

424
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,959
when it comes to criticism they are the highest,

425
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,333
and then when it comes to the ego suddenly you'll see,

426
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,999
give them any position,

427
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,917
it's ....

428
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:54,709
Why? Again you can explain, because there is a cause.

429
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,709
You'll say it is inertia,

430
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,792
blame someone, or it's a bhoot,

431
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:07,000
or it's my ego or my superego, it's not myself.

432
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,792
Myself, I am all right.

433
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,834
Some cause.

434
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,834
Why you have not paid so far?

435
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,208
It's such a problem;

436
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,917
I have to go now.

437
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,208
If you were not coming you should not have come,

438
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,917
but if you are paying, you better pay for it.

439
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,959
Now, what's the matter with you?

440
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,375
They started with fifty people,

441
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,375
now they end up with thirty-five.

442
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,667
We have arranged for it,

443
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:31,917
we have ordered for things and

444
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,000
we have got the buses and all that;

445
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,542
now they are missing.

446
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,250
Nobody asked you to come.

447
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,792
On the contrary I was saying,

448
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:42,250
"Keep it low. Keep it low, so that we'll make it nice."

449
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,083
But you cannot have less than 350

450
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,500
or you can have three hundred,

451
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,959
you can have two hundred,

452
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:51,166
but you cannot just have 210.

453
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,792
Where to put them?

454
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:55,375
A simple thing - see all the mundane style.

455
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,999
But in other places what they have done?

456
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,291
"All right, we have to go. Mother will work it out."

457
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,083
It's worked out.

458
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,999
Everybody has got money, everything done, it's all here.

459
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,083
Americans have done it, surprisingly,

460
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,792
but English

461
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,792
- they don't know whether they are going or not.

462
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,500
Still there are some.

463
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,542
Poor Gavin has to run up and down for all of you.

464
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,500
I tell you, he is the one who has such patience.

465
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,041
And I was amazed

466
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:30,083
that there are still eleven people who have not paid,

467
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,875
can you believe it?

468
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,041
I mean, it's such a simple thing.

469
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,667
If you don't want to go, don't go.

470
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,959
If you want to go, you go.

471
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,667
Tell him you are not going or you are going, finished.

472
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,166
I mean, nobody wants you there.

473
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,375
But even this little thing you cannot because

474
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,667
you have a kind of a ...

475
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:50,041
because, because this has happened,

476
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:54,000
because that has happened, because ...

477
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,458
So the English have to come up much more,

478
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,208
because I have really worked for you people very, very hard,

479
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,458
and again God has given Me work again five years more;

480
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,125
I don't know what we are going to do.

481
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:13,000
Sometimes I feel I should not be back, because no use.

482
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,625
This is a small example I am giving,

483
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,834
very small example,

484
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,125
it's very mundane type.

485
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,125
You can see in other places also, like that.

486
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,458
You tell them anything,

487
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:28,583
"But why, Mother, it happens like that?

488
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:30,375
Why do I do like this?"

489
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:34,709
I mean, asking Me a question, asking Me the cause!

490
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:38,959
"Why did I behave like this? Why do I get into temper?"

491
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,625
Like I have known people

492
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,041
who have been coming to Sahaja Yoga,

493
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,792
doing Sahaja Yoga and all that,

494
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,208
but then they go to some other Steiner's place.

495
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,208
Then they go to some other courses.

496
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,917
I mean, they have no faith in Me - Sahaja Yoga.

497
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:01,250
They are practicing this, they are practicing that like mad,

498
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,709
still going on.

499
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,250
That's only possible in England, I tell you,

500
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,000
nowhere else - it's a speciality.

501
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,709
I have known of so many people who came to Sahaja Yoga;

502
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,917
without practicing Sahaja Yoga,

503
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,458
curing, helping them in Sahaja Yoga, working it out.

504
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,667
They leave Sahaja Yoga.

505
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,041
They're going to this place, that place, that ....

506
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,500
Is this the way?

507
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,625
Now I have known lots of people who

508
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,959
try to blame the leadership.

509
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,667
I am telling you all these things because

510
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,542
I was very sick when I came here, really I tell you,

511
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,750
I was sick for eight days and I was sick even afterwards;

512
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,959
because you know, you are all in My body and I suffer,

513
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,500
so I must tell you.

514
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,166
And then they say the leadership is no good,

515
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,792
leader should be very strong, the leader should be this,

516
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,333
and their leader must have a big thing in his hand,

517
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,583
and they said if he hits us,

518
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:00,000
we are not going to be all right.

519
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:04,041
Again the cause; again the cause.

520
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,625
I tell you, you have one of the best leaders in Gavin,

521
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,250
and I must tell you,

522
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,041
he is the man who spent a lot of money.

523
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,625
Without telling Me he has covered many expenses,

524
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,500
his office has worked for us.

525
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,583
He took all nonsensical people.

526
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,959
If I told him, "This fellow is getting some ego,"

527
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,917
he'll employ in his office.

528
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,625
If I say, "This fellow has got bhoots,"

529
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:26,375
he'll employ in his office.

530
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,333
He has worked with such bhoots

531
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,000
that I could not manage them even for a day.

532
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:39,333
He tries his level best to go to people and tell them that,

533
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,458
"See now, come."

534
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,625
He has saved so many people

535
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,959
by his sense, by his understanding;

536
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,166
but the only thing is he, openly he doesn't lead,

537
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,333
that's his mistake.

538
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,375
He should openly tell,

539
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,375
"You are a bhoot and get cured, then you'll be all right."

540
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,542
But if you say,

541
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,542
"Come here. You see, you are a bhoot, doesn't matter.

542
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,792
I have got lemons, ..., chillies. You sit down."

543
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:58,792
Then, "Mother,

544
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:01,625
he is identifying himself with the greatest bhoot."

545
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,875
Let us face it.

546
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:11,208
If you have understanding of your leader,

547
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:15,166
then you should know that I know better than you know

548
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,583
about it.

549
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,750
And this is very saddening sometimes.

550
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,875
Why don't you understand the sheer goodness of a person?

551
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,542
The amount of bhoots he has tolerated in his office,

552
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:31,458
I tell you, I can't stand them for more than one day,

553
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:32,959
some of them.

554
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,667
So egoistical, some of them, off their heads,

555
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,458
and some of them are so bhootish

556
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,709
that even if they come downstairs

557
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:44,458
I get a pain in the stomach, in My house.

558
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,583
But he stood them.

559
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,333
Why? What was the need?

560
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:52,500
Just that he thought that he'd help them.

561
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,583
Whenever I told him that "This person is bhootish,"

562
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:57,250
I find him employed by Mr Gavin Brown.

563
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,375
Then one day I had to tell him, "Sack all of them,"

564
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,500
and they were sacked.

565
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,834
Why do we have the maximum number of bhoots in England,

566
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,542
I can't understand.

567
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:11,792
Is it necessary to have them around?

568
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,000
On the day when I am going I should not tell you these things,

569
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,250
but when I go away I find these bhoots come back,

570
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,917
and they become the causes, and the effects are shown.

571
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:31,333
So I have to make a complete open picture to you

572
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:35,333
to see that you can ascend to the highest of highest,

573
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,458
being born on this great land of this country.

574
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,959
But you can also go very down, I have seen that.

575
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,959
Because you're always blaming someone,

576
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,458
last of all Gavin,

577
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,709
and this is the worst thing that you have done.

578
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,792
Let anybody say that to Gregoire -

579
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:56,709
he'll chop that person off ten times

580
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,750
and bring that person to me in chopped stages!

581
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,125
Really, I mean!

582
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,333
He'll say, "What nonsense!

583
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,500
All right, it's ... go ahead."

584
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,750
You tell Mr.Warren,

585
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,709
I don't know what he'll do with all of the Australian type.

586
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,917
They are all gems, no doubt.

587
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:20,375
But you deserve a man like Gavin.

588
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,458
I thought, they are special people

589
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,917
that I've worked for you so much,

590
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,959
but I am amazed.

591
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:33,458
The decent people don't need such leaders, do you?

592
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,750
But the people who are decent now

593
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,500
turn out to be Australians, surprisingly,

594
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,834
the way they behave towards Me:

595
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,125
so sweet they are, you'd be surprised,

596
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,625
the children you know.

597
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:49,208
Gavin, he bought some cups and saucers for Me

598
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:52,458
because when I go there they thought they'll give Me tea

599
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,208
in good cups and saucers.

600
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,667
So he bought for all the centers one cup and saucer,

601
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:57,917
good one.

602
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,583
So the children, little, little children,

603
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:00,750
they collected money;

604
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,333
after all, Mother will have a cake, also must have a plate.

605
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,875
So they sent a check here, just see - how sweet!

606
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,667
But I never eat cakes, you know that, but still

607
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:17,000
- so sweet the children, I should say.

608
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,917
What is the reason?

609
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:24,917
Why do we dominate or get dominated?

610
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:25,917
Why?

611
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,166
Again the cause.

612
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,750
Go beyond the cause.

613
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,417
I bless you again and again that when I come next time,

614
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,291
see that you don't make any mistakes anymore.

615
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,291
Meditate and meditate and meditate,

616
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,041
and when you come to India some of you,

617
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,999
I would like to show you as my prize things

618
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,291
from where I've worked, you know.

619
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,083
Even where I've not been, you see,

620
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:56,417
somebody else has given realization to someone in Nepal,

621
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,041
you see,

622
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,834
and they are wonderful flowers;

623
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:02,999
and here am I, something wrong with Me!

624
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,250
Where I have worked,

625
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:10,542
people are more worried about the causes.

626
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:13,125
I have to really make a very, very

627
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:17,041
straightforward appeal to you that now,

628
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,458
grow within yourself.

629
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,999
Are you magnanimous,

630
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,166
are you generous,

631
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,750
are you systematic?

632
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,834
Are you impressive,

633
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:26,709
are you kind,

634
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,375
are you collective?

635
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:32,999
Are you attached to all these nonsensical things still?

636
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,875
Do you talk big,

637
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,875
do you give big lectures?

638
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,999
Humble down yourself,

639
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,250
and then you'll see your greatness.

640
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,667
Unless and until you put your head down to your heart,

641
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,583
how will you see your Mother?

642
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,917
I wish you all great luck now,

643
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:59,250
and happy Christmas to you and happy New Year,

644
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
and a very great New Year in spiritual growth.

645
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:03,792
Let's show it.

646
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:05,667
Let all of us decide today.

647
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,250
Forget about your wives and husbands and children,

648
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,583
and this and that nonsense.

649
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:14,000
Now you are yogis, you are united with Divine.

650
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,208
Grow in it, prosper in it.

651
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,250
May God bless you all.

652
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,667
Now the today's program

653
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,834
should not be very big because we are not allowed

654
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,083
lot of time,

655
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,917
but it's nice that today we could have a little puja of farewell.

656
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,542
But it should be a very small ... because it is,

657
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,250
how much you receive is the point,

658
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,583
because before going I don't want to have all kinds of chakras,

659
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,000
you see, going into spasms.

660
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:58,250
I am sometimes afraid of a puja in England.

661
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:06,333
Gavin, I think you can just ...

662
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,208
It's the mastery.

663
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,875
You must have the mastery,

664
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,417
upon yourself first of all.

665
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:21,208
If you are not a master you cannot act

666
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:24,083
- and upon your instrument, that's the point.

667
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,917
And I would not like anybody to disrespect

668
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:35,999
the leaders at all.

669
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:39,208
You may be very intelligent, that's outside Sahaja Yoga.

670
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,750
In Sahaja Yoga you have to listen to your leaders

671
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,792
and respect, and nobody should try to find faults.

672
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,999
I know his faults, what are his faults are,

673
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:50,083
and I know how to deal with them.

674
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,166
Everybody should try to strengthen.

675
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:57,291
Now I would say in Australia, which is a modern thing,

676
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:02,542
I should say that the whole thing works like one body.

677
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,999
Nobody questions Warren.

678
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:10,333
They telephone to him, they tell him, they collect money,

679
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,875
they put the money - it's all working like one body.

680
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,917
Here everybody is trying to cut the head

681
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,250
- or attack the heart;

682
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,667
that's your heart, that's your brain.

683
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:33,000
So please remember all of you should offer services

684
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:34,999
to Gavin,

685
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,458
to Sahaja Yoga,

686
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,750
before criticizing.

687
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,500
Those who say the books are not arriving,

688
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,125
let them take over the books.

689
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:51,709
Even booking My seats and all that he has to run, I know;

690
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:55,792
whatever you may say about ... he used to do all this.

691
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:01,333
So you should offer your services also,

692
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,709
to do these jobs.

693
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,333
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out.

694
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,917
We are not only here to take blessings

695
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:11,375
but we have certain duties also,

696
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,583
and that's what everybody should offer,

697
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,667
their measure: what can I do, how can I help?

698
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:22,125
What is the work? Let's see now.

699
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,709
I hope in the next meeting you all should sit down

700
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,917
and find out what you can do.

701
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,792
A group can be formed: two, three persons can sit and do it

702
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:35,333
with love, with attention,

703
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,458
so that his burden will be reduced, and you will all feel

704
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,709
the joy that you are doing something for Sahaja Yoga.

705
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,417
Mother has done so much for you,

706
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:44,542
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

707
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,083
You want to have nice ashrams,

708
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,709
nice place to live there,

709
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,333
all right.

710
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,792
You want to have comfortable places, cheaper places,

711
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,083
all right.

712
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,458
You want to have good health,

713
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,417
all right.

714
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:01,083
You want to have fine children, all right; enjoy your life.

715
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,750
But what about giving,

716
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,917
giving your heart,

717
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,792
your respect?

718
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,166
Next time when I come back,

719
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:20,542
I want to see that you are all growing as one body.

720
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,999
At least the Heart should be integrated,

721
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,667
if nothing else.

722
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,166
Imagine a heart

723
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,999
which has the valves which pulsates at various times,

724
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:34,333
all muscles going at different wavelengths.

725
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,333
How can this universe survive with a heart like this?

726
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:43,333
So I have to request all the,

727
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:47,333
all the cells of the Heart to be alert,

728
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,917
to be one in unison with God,

729
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,875
and in loving care of the whole universe.

730
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,458
May God bless you.

731
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,542
So what is this puja supposed to be today?

732
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,458
It's farewell puja

733
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,250
today, so let's have it,

734
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,709
just before the birth of Christ.

735
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:18,333
Let Christ be born within us.

736
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,999
Let's be, like Him,

737
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:24,709
the one who always insisted,

738
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:28,125
"Love your brothers. Love your sisters."

739
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,000
Who are your brothers and sisters?

740
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,667
He asked the question too,

741
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:34,583
"Who are My brothers and sisters?"

742
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,583
"Sahaja yogis are my brothers and sisters."

743
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,291
Somebody offered at the altar.

744
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44,125
He said, "What are you to offer at the altar?

745
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,625
Have you reconciled with your brother?"

746
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,750
Have you reconciled?

747
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:52,750
First reconcile, and then bring flowers to Mother.

748
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,709
He said it already.

749
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,917
Think of Him, how forgiving He was,

750
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:06,834
how magnanimous, how great, and how

751
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,750
He thought of His Father all the time,

752
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,583
completely dedicated,

753
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,291
doing His work.

754
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,166
So with all praises to Christ

755
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,917
and to His Mother who worked

756
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,166
in a very potential manner,

757
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,583
we have to today within ourselves

758
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:34,166
awaken that great Spirit,

759
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,583
which is actually the Aumkara.

760
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,709
Even the memory,

761
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,917
even the idea of that

762
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:48,834
is so joy-giving.

763
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,166
Let His life be reflected in your lives.

764
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:57,917
You have to be true Christians.

765
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:08,083
Let's have ... what is it? ....

766
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:16,834
I think ... Now I would say, next time when you come to puja,

767
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,542
all of you must have

768
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:21,208
the hundred-and-eight names of the Goddess.

769
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,583
You must have all the papers that are there.

770
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,709
Like we have these books,

771
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,583
all of us must have these papers,

772
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:30,999
not only one person should have.

773
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:34,125
We should try to remember certain things also:

774
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,375
the names of the Goddess,

775
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,208
the names that we recite.

776
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,709
We should read them again and again and understand them,

777
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:41,375
the Sanskrit meaning of it.

778
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,250
And it should come to us very easily,

779
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,583
because that is how we are going to work out our chakras.

780
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,000
I don't think we have names of Christ,

781
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,291
it's all right,

782
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,417
and this time I hope we will try to

783
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,542
read some names of Christ.

784
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:03,999
But we have the names of Ganesha but not of Christ,

785
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:07,917
so we'll say the hundred-and-eight names of Shri Ganesh,

786
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:11,750
and somebody can wash My feet, all right ....

787
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:17,875
Have you?

788
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:20,375
Well really, that's the best.

789
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,083
But so, I would say somebody should say now, let's see.

790
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,500
How many names we have? ....

791
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,417
Let Me create the names, and we'll give it to others.

792
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:37,959
Why should only Gavin keep the names?

793
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:49,375
It's not like a prime minister of this country,

794
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,166
you have chosen the leader.

795
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,417
Prime minister is paid money for,

796
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:58,041
she's - that's her job she is doing.

797
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,625
He is not doing his job.

798
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:05,750
You all are doing the job of God.

799
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,166
So why should there be any such thing that ...

800
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,083
Now somebody should read it,

801
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,291
and somebody can.

802
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:25,000
Now who will read it?

803
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,208
Now somebody should read it and somebody can wash My feet.

804
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,917
But don't do it too much, eh?

805
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:34,000
This is Christ - it's not easy to absorb.

806
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,458
All right, let's see.

807
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,667
Let's see how much love you have for Him,

808
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:42,000
how much you absorb Him ...

809
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:47,959
Get up now.

810
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,750
So you must get up to help, some of you.

811
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,834
And others also.

812
00:44:56,834 --> 00:45:00,083
There's nothing to fear that there is ego or anything.

813
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,999
Don't keep back thinking,

814
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,875
"Oh, they think I'm just being ... " -  no, run!

815
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,625
Run for the job.

816
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,166
Now, what is it?

817
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,542
Get some things what you need.

818
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:17,542
Now, who will conduct the puja?

819
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:20,250
Bala, you can do it?

820
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,291
All right, come forward.

821
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,999
Some ladies can come also, what's the harm?

822
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:36,917
Now come here. ...

823
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:42,667
The water and all that ...

824
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,583
Now, you being friends,

825
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,291
you need not trouble too much ...

826
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:50,959
Who was born to teach us of His Father Sadashiva,

827
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,792
the everlasting Almighty God. Amen.

828
00:45:56,709 --> 00:45:59,208
Aum twameva sakshat Shri Jesus sakshat

829
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,208

He is pure pranava energy.

He contains millions of universes.

836
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:26,375
He was born in the primordial cosmic egg.

837
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:30,208
He was conceived in the heart of Shri Mataji.

838
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,000
He was foretold by the prophets.

839
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,709
He was heralded by a star in the east.

840
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,208
He was attended by the three Magi,

841
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,583
who were Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu.

842
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,250
He was born in a stable.

He is the Savior who burns all our sins with His fire.

He adorns the Agnya Chakra.

Because tapasa - He stands at tapassvi.

00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:40,250
Now you see, that's why.

859
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,834
Ascetic, why? Because He is a tapassvi.

He is the narrow gate to the Kingdom of Heaven,

888
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,083
and He is the way.

889
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:35,959
All right.

890
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,583
He is the silence.

891
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:43,834
He is Lord Kartikeya.

892
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,333

00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,125
He is the light in the eyes of Shri Mahalakshmi.

897
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:07,917
He is obedient to His Mother.

898
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,333
He is the perfect Sahaja yogi.

899
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,125
He is the perfect brother.

900
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,583
He is the embodiment of joy.

901
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,583
He is the embodiment of gentleness.

902
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,999
He spits out the half-hearted.

903
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:32,125
He condemns the adulterous eyes.

904
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,709
He condemns all fanatics.

905
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:39,458
Actually, neutralizes the adulterous eyes.

906
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,709
He makes the adulterous eyes innocent,

907
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,792
because He is innocence.

908
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,875
He is uninterested in riches.

909
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,083
He gives all riches to His devotees.

910
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,166
He is pure white.

911
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:05,000
No, this is, you can't say He is uninterested

912
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,875
in rituals - what makes you  think?

913
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:12,375
The rituals which are real ...

914
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,083
See, the one who is riches,

915
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,417
how can He be interested in riches?

916
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:26,083
That's the point ...

917
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,999
Riches He is.

918
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:30,999
Not interested at all, because He being the riches

919
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:33,917
- that is gunatita, as you call it - you see,

920
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,291
the being and the non-being.

921
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,792
When you are the non-being,

922
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,999
you cannot be interested in the being.

923
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,542
Beyond, He is beyond.

924
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:51,166
He is the  sacred heart.

925
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,875
He wears a crown of thorns.

926
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,917
He condemns misery.

927
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,542
He suffered so that we should enjoy.

928
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,417
He is a child, yet He is the ever ancient.

931
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:22,750
equally to those who are first or last.

932
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:26,792
He is ever with us.

933
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:30,166
He is beyond the universe.

934
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,041
He is the sign of the cross.

935
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,417

He is the pure power of desire.

952
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:42,917
His church is the heart.

953
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,291
He has the eleven destroying powers.

954
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,583
He is the destroyer of false prophets.

955
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:53,125
He is the destroyer of untruth.

956
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,917
He is the destroyer of intolerance.

957
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,917
He is the destroyer of racialism.

958
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,750
He is the destroyer of anger.

959
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,875
Of fanaticism - it's very much so.

960
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:11,458
He is the herald of the Golden Age.

961
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,291
He is worshipped by our Mother.

962
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:18,125
He is praised by our Mother.

963
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:20,875
He is loved by our Mother.

964
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,792
He is the one who is chosen.

965
00:54:25,667 --> 00:54:28,291
He is awakened in all Sahaja yogis.

966
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,417
He who rides the white horse at the end of the age.

967
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:37,458
He is the end of our fears.

968
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,542
He guards the gate of our Mother.

969
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:45,291
He is the only way to the Kingdom of God.

970
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,125
Aum Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahavishnu sakshat

971
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,667
Shri Mahavirata sakshat

972
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,917
Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

973
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:56,875
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

974
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:54,291
I think the word "worshipped" should be "adored by our Mother"

975
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:55,917
because He didn't like it, I think,

976
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:57,333
it's catching on the Agnya.

977
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,792
So it's "is adored by."

978
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:02,875
See, He's so particular - you see,

979
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:05,792
the protocol is not all right, that's why.

980
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:09,792
See - better!

981
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:11,750
Agnya was fine. See?

982
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,750
Some catches there are.

983
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,458
I was wondering which one of them was.

984
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:19,291
Now we'll say, "He is adored by our Mother."

985
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,999
He is adored by our Mother.

986
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,333
Again, three times.

987
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,041
He is adored by our Mother.

988
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:26,458
Again.

989
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,999
He is adored by our Mother.

990
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:30,792
He is adored by our Mother.

991
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:34,500
See? He's very particular.

992
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:37,041
May God bless you.

993
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,333
You got the meaning of that?

994
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:14,750
The description of Mahalakshmi, what She gives you,

995
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:21,542
and also the description about Her relationship with Vishnu,

996
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:24,291
with Hari - is Shri Krishna,

997
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:27,208
that She is the beloved of Shri Krishna (Hari)

998
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:30,417
Is the beloved of Shri Krishna;

999
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:33,208
and that's how it explains how Mahalakshmi,

1000
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,750
if She is Mary, then Mary is Radha.

1001
01:06:05,792 --> 01:06:07,792
This has to be done by boys

1002
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,542
who haven't got the feeling of marriage,

1003
01:06:11,917 --> 01:06:15,999
or think of it. It has to be that pure.
