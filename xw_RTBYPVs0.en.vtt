AI GENERATED. OK

1
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.840
OK.

2
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:16.750
OK.

3
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.129
So.

4
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
Yeah.

5
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.220
OK.

6
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.909
OK.

7
00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.400
I think it's.

8
00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.950
OK.

9
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620
What?

10
00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:34.510
you.

11
00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.230
That's for musicians.

12
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389
OK

13
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.169
You.

14
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.360
Mhm

15
00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.339
Sure has to be taken

16
00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319
Yeah

17
00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:05.809
So I let her think that she

18
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.380
What

19
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.339
He's

20
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.570
I keep

21
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.869
Comfortable chairs will they be all right physicians,

22
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.630
I don't think so.

23
00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.460
You

24
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.669
see,

25
00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.699
because the,

26
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.149
she put it only on the ground.

27
00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.240
They they asked for it to be raised.

28
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.800
They came in,

29
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.309
had a look and said that you must raise it,

30
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.500
but it's soft.

31
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.970
I know what you mean by that.

32
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.960
But what is that in between?

33
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.029
Just raise it up to that point is all right.

34
00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:51.240
Why do you want to raise it even higher?

35
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.009
They asked.

36
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.330
No,

37
00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.490
no,

38
00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:53.690
no.

39
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.800
They cannot sit on that,

40
00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.750
they cannot pay the public.

41
00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.320
That's all right.

42
00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.970
That's

43
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.360
That one's

44
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.479
It will be very small,

45
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.919
I think.

46
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.580
You want that for today we had seats.

47
00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.059
6.

48
00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.679
But that is the problem.

49
00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.970
All right,

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.360
let's see.

51
00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.279
You're not to do so.

52
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.399
The

53
00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.089
So what now?

54
00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.149
What about him?

55
00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.880
Is it ready?

56
00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.960
Just find out.

57
00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.779
If so,

58
00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.330
we can have the food now,

59
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.820
then have the programme because otherwise it would be very late

60
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.649
or if the food is going to take time,

61
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.470
then we'll have the programme and then the.

62
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.139
One of the people there are some new people here.

63
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.289
Not many,

64
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.309
about

65
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.179
10 or 20,

66
00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.949
that's all.

67
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.860
If the food is ready,

68
00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:04.850
you can serve them.

69
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.119
If the food is not ready,

70
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.500
then they will start to cook.

71
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:10.289
Is the food ready?

72
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.110
What I'm saying.

73
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.509
Who's a

74
00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.209
It will take some time for and how when do they start?

75
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.480
I mean it's what I'm saying when do they start the've gone home to change.

76
00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:19.589
They're at Paul's to change.

77
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.640
They should be back,

78
00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.700
I'd say probably

79
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.089
in half an hour I'd say.

80
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.750
Tell them to come out tomorrow.

81
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.309
We can telephone,

82
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.790
yes,

83
00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:48.109
but for the first of all,

84
00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.980
what is the situation?

85
00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:52.299
Can you serve it immediately or what?

86
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.470
The food is ready,

87
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.640
so you telephone to them.

88
00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.670
Can you

89
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.940
come after one hour

90
00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:02.940
because they be gone to change and rest and take it easy.

91
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.070
What about their food?

92
00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:03.160
They're taking their food over there.

93
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.959
Yes.

94
00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:13.730
That's

95
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.820
You see,

96
00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:19.200
because otherwise,

97
00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.649
we should be quick if possible.

98
00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:23.000
We can.

99
00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:30.029
Should eat not too much in life it's better.

100
00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:33.369
You.

101
00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:39.079
What did you

102
00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:42.190
To.

103
00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.470
I.

104
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.690
Yeah

105
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.779
One's suggesting I should make an

106
00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.440
announcement.

107
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.570
Yes

108
00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.450
it

109
00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089
But.

110
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.470
Give me something.

111
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.269
I

112
00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:34.209
don't wanna stand over.

113
00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:42.000
Mhm.

114
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.019
Yeah.

115
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.549
Right.

116
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.859
Yeah.

117
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.339
All right,

118
00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:54.709
I'll say a few words.

119
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.179
I was like.

120
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.720
Sri Masay.

121
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.450
Mr.

122
00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:03.450
Srivastava.

123
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.130
On behalf of

124
00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.459
Brighton centre,

125
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.209
it's my very

126
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.019
pleasant duty to welcome.

127
00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:14.399
You to this town.

128
00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:23.290
And I'd like also to welcome

129
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.549
The new people who have not attended.

130
00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.880
Any of our programmes

131
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.160
prior to this

132
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.799
festival.

133
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.260
This evening's

134
00:07:36.859 --> 00:07:38.890
programme is a musical programme.

135
00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:44.679
We're very privileged to have

136
00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:48.230
A programme of Indian classical music

137
00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:49.829
which will

138
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.559
be commencing in about.

139
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.369
One hour's time

140
00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:00.950
What what we have found.

141
00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:03.869
Through Sarioga

142
00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:05.850
Is that

143
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.880
Music of this kind.

144
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.359
Has a certain

145
00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:12.600
coefficient

146
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.209
and carries

147
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.000
vibrations which

148
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.440
awaken our senses.

149
00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:24.450
And so by listening to.

150
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.279
The classical music of India.

151
00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:34.599
Really one can enjoy a very deep

152
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.719
meditative experience.

153
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.729
So I hope that those new people who are here.

154
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.270
Will have such an experience this evening.

155
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.989
And really there could not be any more auspicious.

156
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.380
occasion in which to

157
00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:09.229
Make the acquaintance perhaps of a new art form.

158
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.700
Other than in the presence of Shrimataje.

159
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:17.780
So

160
00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.869
prior to the commencement of the concert,

161
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.669
we'll be serving

162
00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:25.630
some supper.

163
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.229
Which I hope also you'll enjoy very much.

164
00:09:32.849 --> 00:09:33.390
Thank you.

165
00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:37.130
There's a small one in covered.

166
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:48.190
You go.

167
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:52.539
Thank you to about

168
00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:58.409
you say few words.

169
00:10:02.729 --> 00:10:02.770
I

170
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:06.719
Lift him up.

171
00:10:08.729 --> 00:10:09.690
You said take it down.

172
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:11.840
No,

173
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:12.659
no,

174
00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:12.820
no,

175
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.580
I think it's.

176
00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:38.440
It's always a problem when I have to say something.

177
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.820
Doctor Spiro.

178
00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:43.849
And uh

179
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.239
Doaa yogis and Sayoginis?

180
00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:51.080
I want only to say a few words of

181
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.780
Thanks and gratitude for the very

182
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.219
Warm and moving welcome which you have accorded

183
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.929
on the occasion of

184
00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.780
The arrival of

185
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.190
Shri Mataji here.

186
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.719
As you appreciate when I say Shri Mataji,

187
00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:15.030
I hesitate a little because she also happens to be my wife

188
00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:16.320
and uh.

189
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.729
But it's a great

190
00:11:19.619 --> 00:11:20.729
credit to her that

191
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.690
she's fulfilling both roles so well,

192
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.010
that of a wife,

193
00:11:25.099 --> 00:11:25.460
a mother,

194
00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:26.340
a grandmother.

195
00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:28.270
And at the same time,

196
00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:29.270
the universal mother.

197
00:11:30.929 --> 00:11:31.250
To me,

198
00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:33.000
it's a very great privilege to be

199
00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:36.380
asked to be here,

200
00:11:36.409 --> 00:11:38.359
to be given the opportunity to be here

201
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.320
and to feel

202
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.880
that one belongs to this glorious

203
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.169
family.

204
00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:45.340
I'm

205
00:11:47.809 --> 00:11:50.030
serving the United Nations system

206
00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:51.840
and uh

207
00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:52.400
you know,

208
00:11:52.409 --> 00:11:55.729
the United Nations system was established to bring the world together,

209
00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:56.880
to unite the world.

210
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.659
Unfortunately

211
00:11:58.869 --> 00:12:00.739
I cannot say that we have succeeded very well.

212
00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:01.109
In fact,

213
00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:04.500
if you read the newspapers every morning,

214
00:12:04.989 --> 00:12:08.219
you'll probably see more of division than of unity,

215
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.299
and yet we persist

216
00:12:10.989 --> 00:12:13.059
in our endeavours to unite the world.

217
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.859
But what Srimataji is doing and what you are doing

218
00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:18.729
is really to create

219
00:12:19.229 --> 00:12:19.789
one

220
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:20.859
good,

221
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.059
pure,

222
00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:22.940
chaste,

223
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.469
loving human family.

224
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.409
You are giving

225
00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:27.849
reality

226
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.780
to the ideal of

227
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:31.210
one

228
00:12:31.739 --> 00:12:32.880
interdependent

229
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.309
humankind.

230
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:36.950
There is a

231
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:38.700
great joy in that,

232
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.380
the great satisfaction in that,

233
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.869
the great spiritual elevation in that.

234
00:12:44.789 --> 00:12:45.849
And all of that,

235
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.349
I know you all feel

236
00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:48.669
you owe to

237
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.239
this lady.

238
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:51.599
Well,

239
00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.919
I'm sure you're anxious to hear her rather than me.

240
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.739
I therefore stop now except to

241
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.179
thank you very,

242
00:12:59.229 --> 00:13:00.219
very much indeed

243
00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:01.780
for your kindness,

244
00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:03.619
your affection,

245
00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:04.659
and your love.

246
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.229
Thank you.

247
00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:47.609
Mhm.

248
00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:49.809
No.

249
00:13:55.219 --> 00:13:57.969
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

250
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.669
And to all those who have found it.

251
00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.340
Sir yoga is the blessing

252
00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:12.919
of modern times.

253
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.510
Which is meant for the seekers.

254
00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:23.900
Seeking also I find these days has become like a fashion.

255
00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:25.619
Oh

256
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.039
But there are many who are

257
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.760
real seekers.

258
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.440
Genuine seeker.

259
00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:39.179
They're trying

260
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.039
All their lives

261
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.969
To find

262
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.159
The source

263
00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:51.320
of peace,

264
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.200
joy,

265
00:14:52.289 --> 00:14:53.049
and bliss.

266
00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:55.190
That is the spirit.

267
00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.869
As you know in yoga.

268
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.090
You cannot pay for it.

269
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.030
You cannot put in any effort for it.

270
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.070
It's your own.

271
00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:07.950
It's within you.

272
00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:11.929
But after realisation,

273
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.299
There's one thing that is lacking.

274
00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:19.239
In many seekers,

275
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.750
perhaps maybe

276
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.270
because they cannot give up this

277
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.909
seeking shopping as I call it.

278
00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:32.049
You have to have consistent movement

279
00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:33.299
upward.

280
00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:36.469
In Sanskrit,

281
00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:37.469
it's called sapa.

282
00:15:39.489 --> 00:15:41.250
That is something one has to put in.

283
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.140
That effort has to go

284
00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:45.340
otherwise.

285
00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:47.969
realisation

286
00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:53.780
Is extremely a temporary phase.

287
00:15:54.969 --> 00:15:57.429
It doesn't happen in the countries where

288
00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:59.229
there has been a tradition

289
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.599
of understanding.

290
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.679
What is to be sought?

291
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.000
So it must be understood that it is not a mental approach.

292
00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:13.900
Or a behavioural change,

293
00:16:14.409 --> 00:16:16.739
but it is a complete transformation within,

294
00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:17.979
which is important.

295
00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:21.450
For that you have to have patience with yourself.

296
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.349
You have to forgive yourself.

297
00:16:23.469 --> 00:16:24.789
Actually you have to love yourself.

298
00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:28.469
And work it out.

299
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.380
Delicate handling,

300
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.169
I'm sure all of you can achieve a lot.

301
00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:39.000
I was really overwhelmed today

302
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.030
by the

303
00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:43.479
beautiful expression of your love at the

304
00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:44.890
railway station.

305
00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:46.369
I felt even the

306
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.500
trains and the people who were handling them were all moved with that.

307
00:16:51.049 --> 00:16:51.890
It was too much.

308
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.510
Just

309
00:16:53.669 --> 00:16:55.369
the ocean of love flowing,

310
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.539
that's all within you

311
00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:59.030
in your heart.

312
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.059
It has to flow

313
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.469
You have to open your heart,

314
00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:05.089
not with any fear.

315
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.348
Not with any trouble,

316
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.949
not with any,

317
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:10.108
uh,

318
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.739
barriers,

319
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.479
but just openly,

320
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.170
just fluid,

321
00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:16.550
and you'll be surprised

322
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.310
that everybody is anxious to do that.

323
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.108
Everyone is anxious to extend

324
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.608
their love to you.

325
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.819
So for those who have come for the first time,

326
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.089
I have to tell them,

327
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.300
take it easy.

328
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.630
Try to understand

329
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.800
Do not feel hurt if somebody tells you something.

330
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.079
Do not get upset with it.

331
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:39.619
It's a

332
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.510
Situation in which

333
00:17:43.069 --> 00:17:44.449
you have to be all right.

334
00:17:45.459 --> 00:17:47.339
It is you who has to become.

335
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.410
Nobody else,

336
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.560
it's you who has to gain.

337
00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:52.369
With this,

338
00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.469
if you move,

339
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.630
I'm sure,

340
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.040
as so many have got realisation,

341
00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.459
you all will

342
00:17:58.719 --> 00:17:59.910
establish it.

343
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.239
I do not know how to thank you.

344
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.520
I mean,

345
00:18:02.599 --> 00:18:07.020
I don't know what to say because people have come from such long distances

346
00:18:07.439 --> 00:18:08.599
to express their love.

347
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.650
And to

348
00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:16.410
Meet me here.

349
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.300
It's too much.

350
00:18:20.339 --> 00:18:21.729
For me to say anything.

351
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.170
Except

352
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.719
I feel that

353
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.790
in my childhood,

354
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.709
I used to have dreams of

355
00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:30.670
having a global

356
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:31.839
family.

357
00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:33.619
And

358
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.800
I would tell my father

359
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.400
that in my family,

360
00:18:37.469 --> 00:18:40.280
I'll have as many people as there are stars

361
00:18:40.689 --> 00:18:41.680
in the sky.

362
00:18:44.229 --> 00:18:44.699
It was

363
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.410
But so many are still last,

364
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.699
and I don't know how will I meet them,

365
00:18:49.979 --> 00:18:50.829
very anxious.

366
00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:53.469
I will do whatever is possible.

367
00:18:54.239 --> 00:18:55.619
You all should help me there.

368
00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.640
And

369
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.699
those who are not yet established must know that

370
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.109
it's God's work.

371
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.270
We are in a new age.

372
00:19:05.109 --> 00:19:07.420
And we have to understand the seriousness

373
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.939
of the whole situation.

374
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.949
Work it out yourself.

375
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.500
And then through you

376
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.300
God's work will be done

377
00:19:17.969 --> 00:19:18.689
beautifully.

378
00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:21.089
Blessing the whole universe,

379
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.609
that's what we want.

380
00:19:23.689 --> 00:19:24.140
As Mr.

381
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.939
Shiva has told you that United Nations is

382
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.949
doing its work,

383
00:19:27.989 --> 00:19:28.979
it's the tree,

384
00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:30.380
but the roots

385
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.540
are you.

386
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.099
You are the roots of the United Nations.

387
00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:35.670
If there are no roots,

388
00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:36.859
there's no reality.

389
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.089
So only if you form organisations,

390
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.609
there's no reality.

391
00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:43.890
The reality comes from the roots,

392
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.680
and you are the roots of all these ideas

393
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.569
by which we'll have global peace.

394
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.660
Globallis

395
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.900
and global emancipation.

396
00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:55.790
May God bless you all.

397
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.869
I hope all the new people will achieve

398
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.010
their ascent

399
00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:01.280
with humility.

400
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.709
With humility,

401
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:04.790
may God bless.

402
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520
Mhm.

403
00:20:54.089 --> 00:20:54.260
I don't know.

404
00:20:55.949 --> 00:20:56.380
I told you,

405
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.260
the musicians are going to eat here.

406
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.540
They're coming soon.

407
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:00.790
I.

408
00:21:15.459 --> 00:21:15.479
2.

409
00:21:16.229 --> 00:21:17.109
I think you

410
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760
Yeah

411
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.530
Did you get that.

412
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.079
I

413
00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:40.839
Yeah

414
00:21:43.089 --> 00:21:43.300
OK

415
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.119
Have you got a have you got a tape recording?

416
00:21:51.969 --> 00:21:52.000
Can do music.

417
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:55.900
Can you.

418
00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:56.709
I'll put it through the system which

419
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.270
quickly.

420
00:22:23.109 --> 00:22:23.130
OK.

421
00:22:25.569 --> 00:22:27.310
Tomorrow night we'll have our

422
00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:29.130
our.

423
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.170
And then these people will be here

424
00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:38.339
for the programme,

425
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.729
so I think tomorrow night we all will have our own programme

426
00:22:42.459 --> 00:22:43.579
of the surgeries,

427
00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:45.170
but today

428
00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:46.609
we have,

429
00:22:46.939 --> 00:22:48.410
we haven't got so much time.

430
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.670
So let's have

431
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.930
the dinner

432
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.569
and then this programme.

433
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.469
And then tomorrow,

434
00:22:54.609 --> 00:22:56.479
I don't know what's the programme tomorrow morning?

435
00:23:02.439 --> 00:23:02.500
We can't have this.

436
00:23:05.949 --> 00:23:06.189
All right,

437
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.959
so you can have your own seminar sort of thing of your own,

438
00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:11.589
and then in the evening,

439
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:11.949
uh,

440
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.540
evening 6 o'clock,

441
00:23:13.709 --> 00:23:14.500
we'll have that.

442
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.189
It's so spontaneous.

443
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.000
I mean,

444
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.410
I was.

445
00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:23.630
Uh,

446
00:23:23.719 --> 00:23:25.239
I don't know how you are accommodated.

447
00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:26.079
I just don't know.

448
00:23:26.089 --> 00:23:28.270
I'm quite worried about that,

449
00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:29.069
how you are living,

450
00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:31.199
but there is love that we can manage.

451
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:32.729
You can

452
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.150
tolerate all kinds of things,

453
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.130
but love is such a joy giving,

454
00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:37.390
such a joy.

455
00:23:38.229 --> 00:23:40.229
Nobody minds any discomfort,

456
00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:42.380
the comfort of the spirit.

457
00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:45.000
So we have to thank the,

458
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.290
I don't know,

459
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.189
the Sergio of Brighton,

460
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.619
all of them

461
00:23:58.089 --> 00:23:59.140
and their leader,

462
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.180
that all this has done so well.

463
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.839
Are you playing some music?

464
00:24:59.689 --> 00:24:59.699
Yeah.

465
00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:03.689
They have seen the place,

466
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.579
they've seen it.

467
00:25:07.709 --> 00:25:07.719
I

468
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:09.140
Yeah.

469
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:16.310
You can

470
01:07:18.879 --> 01:07:18.889
Mhm

471
01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:23.409
Yeah

472
01:07:26.439 --> 01:07:26.489
OK.

473
01:07:29.649 --> 01:07:29.959
It's not.

474
01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:37.689
Just.

475
01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:40.540
Yes

476
01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:49.760
Can you pass your plates back quickly please?

477
01:07:49.969 --> 01:07:50.669
You want to get me.

478
01:07:59.239 --> 01:07:59.250
So

479
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:03.310
Yeah.

480
01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:12.379
Yeah.

481
01:08:23.379 --> 01:08:23.430
Fee.

482
01:08:28.089 --> 01:08:28.220
What's

483
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:38.560
Yeah.

484
01:08:47.459 --> 01:08:47.470
Mhm

485
01:08:52.089 --> 01:08:52.600
Oh yes,

486
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.250
Antonio.

487
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.399
Antonio.

488
01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:02.490
Mhm.

489
01:09:06.417 --> 01:09:06.769
I.

490
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:11.259
OK.

491
01:09:16.259 --> 01:09:16.270
I,

492
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.580
I.

493
01:09:22.108 --> 01:09:22.118
OK.

494
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:24.689

495
01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:29.419
Take.

496
01:09:32.259 --> 01:09:32.270
Oh.

497
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:36.680
Mm.

498
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:42.009
Yes.

499
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.160
OK.

500
01:09:46.368 --> 01:09:46.438
I'm more worried about him.

501
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:56.609
I know.

502
01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:00.580
Yeah.

503
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.540
I

504
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:08.680
is this.

505
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:15.709
I didn't.

506
01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:26.379
Yeah

507
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.589
Your legs.

508
01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:35.810
Don't

509
01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:40.569
Yeah,

510
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.220
so

511
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:51.479
can

512
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.859
They've called them.

513
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:53.290
They've called them.

514
01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:01.479
They called them.

515
01:11:05.529 --> 01:11:05.600
Oh

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:07.029
Mm.

517
01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.229
Mhm.

518
01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.279
What's that?

519
01:11:24.939 --> 01:11:25.339
Let's go.

520
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.569
Yeah

521
01:22:34.089 --> 01:22:34.100
Yeah.
