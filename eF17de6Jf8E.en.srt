1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:07,470
I bow to 

2
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:56,580
all the seekers of truth. I’ve been many
a times in Birmingham before and today I find

3
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:49,260
there are so many people whom I know very
well, and gradually we are all increasing

4
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,709
in size, understanding our Spirit.

5
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:04,709
Now, the seeking of the Spirit is not a new
thing. It’s a very ancient pursuit of human

6
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:17,530
beings. They have been seeking the Spirit
and many a times many prophets, many great

7
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,810
incarnations came on this Earth to help the
people in their pursuit. The seeking of the

8
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Spirit is a inner urge, a very compelling
urge within ourselves. But we don’t know

9
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:55,669
what we have to seek; we don’t know what
it means to be twice born.

10
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:10,300
I come from India and suddenly I feel I belong
to Britain. I’ve become British and I feel

11
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:28,030
the shock that we are all facing. Where are
we going? The other day I saw some program

12
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,590
about cocaine smuggling in England and I was
shocked. All self-destructive things sometimes

13
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,500
can be misunderstood as Spirit seeking. One
can misunderstand. But they lead us nowhere

14
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,500
- is a fact. Then why do we do it? We do it
- I know that we do it only because we are

15
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,639
seeking the Spirit. It’s very misleading,
though. We seek the Spirit in wrong things.

16
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:37,350
This urge we think will be fulfilled by wrong
things, by doing wrong to ourselves, by harming

17
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,009
ourselves, by torturing ourselves.

18
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:51,009
We get bored. Why? Why do we get bored of
life? Life should be bubbling with joy. Because

19
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:02,180
we think life is worth nothing, we have to
seek. And what do we seek there? It’s a

20
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:09,180
amazing thing how many seekers are born in
the West – so many seekers! Even I talk

21
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,930
to little children and I am surprised that
there is seeking within them. They are seeking

22
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:31,180
something and they don’t understand the
mystery of seeking. They don’t even understand

23
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,199
what they are seeking, but they think there’s
something wrong. They feel frustrated, angered,

24
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,000
and they feel that life has not given them
what they wanted. They’re bored stiff; they

25
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
don’t know what to do so they take to vandalism,
some sort of a sensation. They try to destroy

26
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,849
others or themselves.

27
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:09,849
So the human mind today is at a different
level, we must understand, especially in the

28
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,910
West. Of course East has its own problems,
but it has traditional understanding about

29
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:23,910
seeking and it understands what to seek. But
in the West such intense seekers are there

30
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,400
and they don’t know what to seek, what to
achieve, what is Spirit. It’s a big problem.

31
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:40,349
But today one has to realize that the category
of people that are born in these modern times

32
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:50,259
are very different from the people who were
born about say, I would say fifty years back.

33
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:58,149
They had political ambitions, economic ambitions;
they wanted to achieve political freedom,

34
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:08,759
power. That generation is practically over
now. They have realized that in this power

35
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,040
game they’re not going to gain anything.
It’s a subject finished now for them; it’s

36
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:25,679
something absurd. They find the whole thing
is a joke - same with the economic problem.

37
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:32,769
Like there was once upon a time a gold rush.
So everybody rushed to find the gold. Today

38
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:41,589
if anybody wants to do that, people will think,
“Are you mad? Must be joking.”

39
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,100
So the category of people today are of a different
level, we must be aware of that. We must understand

40
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,929
that the category is very different which
perhaps media people don’t understand so

41
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:04,540
much. I don’t think they have any idea as
to what is the level of awareness of human

42
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:11,540
beings today in the West. They are still of
that old school which was busy fighting elections

43
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,860
or strikes and this and that - all nonsensical
things. But the people who are aware are many,

44
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:31,689
many more than yet what we know of, that they
are seeking something very different that

45
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:40,529
their fathers and forefathers did not seek,
because the times are such. Today, it’s

46
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:47,949
a special time – special time where many
people have to get their Spirit. But then

47
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:56,739
again we are misled because people who are
trying to exploit this have found a good market,

48
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,040
and they come down to find out how they can
market their goods in this new awareness of

49
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,389
people.

50
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:20,389
We get enamored because we are still not fully
conscious or knowledgeable about what to expect

51
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:31,449
in your spiritual pursuit. And that’s how
they come and befool us. We have cults and

52
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:39,239
we have sects, but one must understand that
as you have grown through amoeba in your evolutionary

53
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:50,059
process, gradually, from that to this level,
the awareness has to also grow the same way,

54
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:58,259
in a traditional way. It cannot be somebody
like Freud coming up and saying something

55
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:05,259
new, that we accept. Suddenly, how can we
deviate from all those who talked of something

56
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:17,459
very different from what Freud has been talking?
Because it’s a mind which is of course very

57
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:26,660
aware, but also it is what we call very right-sided
mind, as is described in the Gita they are

58
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:34,189
called as the people who are rajasikas, the
people who are in action. They live with the

59
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,480
power of action.

60
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,480
So the people who live with the power of their
action live with their egos, and ego likes

61
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,709
something new, some sort of a new stuff comes
in they think, “Oh, why not do that? Try

62
00:12:54,709 --> 00:13:01,709
this, try that.” It’s like a horse which
wants to go into every new direction and fails.

63
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:12,449
It’s a very venturesome horse, I think,
and that’s how something new somebody says,

64
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:20,959
everybody jumps to it. We are not new ourselves,
we are ancient. And when we take to some new

65
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:32,489
idea suddenly we find after some time that
we have to recoil back, because these are

66
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:41,569
all mental projections and that’s how in
every religion there have been sects formed.

67
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:49,609
Because, say Catholicism - Martin Luther who
was himself a realized soul saw that Pope

68
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:59,379
was doing all kinds of wrong things, so he
started a new sect. But it’s a mental projection

69
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:06,449
still, I would say, though he was a realized
soul. Then out of that came out I don’t

70
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:13,079
know how many churches. So now we have one
Unification Church which turned out to be

71
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,029
another horrible stuff, then we have Unity
Church where they unite all these sects – is

72
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:26,029
all projections, all branches of that mental
movement. But the essence is lost. In the

73
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:35,859
first case it was lost, and it was completely
forgotten in the last case.

74
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:45,009
So that’s how the sects were born. Now we
find Pentecostals. The other day I was reading

75
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:52,009
the harm it has done to people. We have all
kinds of faiths - Seventh Day Adventists.

76
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:59,419
What does it matter what was the seventh day,
the Sabbath? Supposing you have your Sabbath

77
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:07,259
day, say, on the seventh day, will you become
righteous? Will you become virtuous? Will

78
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:16,220
you become your Spirit? By changing a particular
type of ideology or thought, will you be transformed,

79
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,529
will you become great, will you become a super
human being? No. Then what? You think that

80
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:43,129
by going from one sect to another sect you’ll
achieve something great, you will just form

81
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:50,129
different social orders, that’s all.

82
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:57,379
Then you have anti-culture, another sect formed
as a reaction. That also is another problem.

83
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:06,439
All these venturesome ideas of this horse
takes you from places to places, and you think,

84
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:11,600
“Why whenever we try to do something why
we are committing the mistake?” Because

85
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,600
we have forgotten the fundamental, and the
fundamental is very simple, that you have

86
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:27,379
to seek your Spirit, and when you seek your
Spirit it is a spontaneous happening, it’s

87
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:35,139
a living process in your evolutionary process
by which you become the Spirit. By mental

88
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,739
projection you cannot.

89
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:46,739
Then the people who took advantage of the
situation that there are so many seekers on

90
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:54,889
this Earth, they started all kinds of cults,
also. I’ve been talking against them since

91
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:05,389
1970 that “Don’t go to these cults. These
are another ego-pampering stuffs.” Suddenly

92
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,199
they start a new idea – it appeals to you.
Suddenly someone says that “No, by leading

93
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:21,819
this kind of a life you’ll achieve God.”
You accept it. Why not find out? Since ages

94
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:30,669
people have been writing about the spiritual
life. What does that mean? How to achieve

95
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:39,340
it? Why do you take to anyone who just says
that “This is so, this is so”? Because

96
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:47,370
perhaps they have a nice circus or a publicity.
There must be something that is so attractive

97
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,970
that people take to it. Or maybe it is some
sort of a ego-pampering that you want to join

98
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,419
these cults and get destroyed.

99
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:08,419
There cannot be a cult for your assent. What
cults did you follow to become human beings?

100
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:21,710
The nature itself works it out. It is a spontaneous
happening. But for a person who lives only

101
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,960
with mental projections, morning till evening
you see television or listen to radio, it’s

102
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,720
nothing but mental projection all the time,
you see, hovering on your head. You cannot

103
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,139
think that there is something beyond that
mental projection which is the reality.

104
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:46,139
So you find reality horrifying, absolutely
horrifying. You have to pay the tax; you have

105
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,059
to pay the rates; you have to pay this. You
have to be like this; you have to be dressed

106
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:57,029
up like this; you have to have clothes like
this. All kinds of pressures on your head.

107
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:03,389
So now what to do? How to get out of this?
This is reality for people.

108
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:10,389
So then we accept the drugs and the alcohols
and things because we want to get out of it.

109
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:20,539
That gives definitely a sensation, hallucination;
but reality in itself is so beautiful, is

110
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:31,909
so surmounting all this, that we have to honestly
understand that if it is reality, it cannot

111
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:43,679
be hallucination. It cannot. You cannot pay
for it. You cannot follow somebody who says

112
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:52,389
something against the tradition of evolution.
It has to be fundamental, what it has been

113
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,950
and will be. It has to be something that is
integrating everything, integrating all the

114
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,710
religions, integrating all the religious leaders,
all the great prophets and all the great incarnations,

115
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:21,710
otherwise it cannot be reality because reality
has to be one. It should unite everything.

116
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:31,830
It cannot create a separate identity on mental
level. It may create on a spiritual level,

117
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:44,700
maybe, that people who get Realization, who
have got Self Realization, maybe the people

118
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,519
form a more coordinated concord among themselves,
but they’re all the time worried about the

119
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:05,789
other people who are not yet in there – not
for money, not for lust, not for greed, but

120
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:13,330
only because they want to share the joy of
reality.

121
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,230
This has to be first of all understood by
all those who are seeking that reality cannot

122
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:27,230
be a mental projection, neither can it be
a emotional projection which we can manage

123
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:33,330
ourselves. One moment we are in love, another
moment we are walking to the divorce cases.

124
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:40,330
Why? If there was some truth in that kind
of a love, why? It is something beyond, which

125
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:49,009
is eternal, which doesn’t change, which
overflows, is promised. What about that? Why

126
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,620
not seek that?

127
00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Then you turn your eyes to find out where
it is described. Vedas were written thousand

128
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:12,279
of years back and every Veda, whichever you
read, the Upanishads as they are called as

129
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:22,149
the people where they have described about
human beings have talked that you have to

130
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,320
worry about your Spirit, it’s the Spirit
that is important. Then you have other people,

131
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:37,639
in India we had fourteen thousand years back
some great poets. All of them have said the

132
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:44,639
same. Then we have people in other countries
like Abraham, like Moses, we have Confucius,

133
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:58,389
Lao Tse. We have Krishna, Rama. All of them
have said one thing, and one thing that “You

134
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,750
seek your Spirit.”

135
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:12,750
If so, then how? We should again look back.
It is described how to seek it. It is described

136
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:27,710
in Gita, but much before that it is described
in the Vedas very clearly about the Kundalini

137
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:36,129
and the seven Chakras. Nobody says in any
book that when the Kundalini awakens you become

138
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,970
mad or you start jumping like a frog.

139
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:49,970
Recently I went to Pune, and there I was surprised
that the Brahmins of Pune, who are supposed

140
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:57,350
to be very learned people, were all suffering
from high blood pressure, from kidney troubles,

141
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:05,110
from insanity. I mean name any disease, they
had it. I said, “Why are they suffering

142
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,899
like this?” So there was one fellow called
[Gumani, Gurumani, or Gulumani ???] Maharaj

143
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:15,629
who really came as the killer of all these
Brahmins, I think, that they followed him.

144
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:22,629
And their main person came to discuss with
Me about his religion, so-called.

145
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,049
And he started asking Me, “Do you know about
“terno pai, erno pai”

146
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:36,049
I said, “What is that? I’ve never heard.
Where is it described?”

147
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,200
‘Oh, You have never heard about it?”

148
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,860
I said, “No.”

149
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,409
“Do You know about shaktipath?”

150
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:47,090
I said, “I’ve never heard about this.
From where does it come? Which book?”

151
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,509
“Oh, it’s from one book.”

152
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:49,990
I said, “Which book?”

153
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:55,690
“About sixty years back there was one Vishnutirth,
Swami Vishnutirth who wrote this book.”

154
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,279
I said, “Really?”

155
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,330
He’s the only one. Only sixty years back
this fellow comes up from somewhere, writes

156
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:08,809
down something new, “erno pai, terno pai.”
All the Vedas, all the Shastras are all finished.

157
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,460
Bible is finished. Everything is finished.
Only this fellow sixty years back comes up

158
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,309
from somewhere and talks about shaktipath
and you believe it. All of you, the Brahmins,

159
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,440
the educated, the learned.

160
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,440
I said, “Where do you see these words in
the Vedas? Show Me. Where do you see them

161
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:29,850
in the Patanjali Yoga Shastra? Show Me. Is
it written anywhere? “

162
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,710
He said, “We haven’t read them.”

163
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,639
I said, “What did you read?”

164
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:32,450
“This Vishnutirtha’s book.”

165
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:39,450
I said, “You are supposed to be learned
people in Sanskit. You read only this Vishnutirth

166
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,610
who came only sixty years back?”

167
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:49,610
How can it be? And all of them are so sick
you won’t believe it, and in My presence

168
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:59,669
when they came they were in a very bad shape,
absolutely in a very bad shape as if they

169
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:05,389
had taken cocaine or something worse than
that. Eyes were going up, their hands were

170
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:08,720
moving like this, all kinds of things.

171
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,950
And I told them, “Please forgive Me. Go
to Vishnutirth or to his disciple, this [Gumani,

172
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,200
Gurumani, or Gulumani ???] Maharaj.”

173
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,950
And the only thing they did was not to eat
this, not to eat that, not to have relationship

174
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:29,759
with your wife, become like a dry bean, live
on a shoe string and then you become godly,

175
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,499
is it? It’s very simple. In India so many
are like that already.

176
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:46,499
Use your brains! They are very brainy people.

177
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,820
I said, “How could this man dominate you?”

178
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,340
So they came out with very intelligent answer
that “In the Vedas, you see, when we followed

179
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,799
the Vedas and what did we get?”

180
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,570
“All right.” I said, “You didn’t get
anything. But there’s something promised

181
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:11,370
in the Vedas, in the ancient books, that in
Kali Yuga, at these modern times, you will

182
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:17,120
get your Realization. Why didn’t you go
for that?”

183
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,559
But this fellow says that through erno pai,
karuno pai - God knows all kinds of nonsensical

184
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:30,330
words, it has no meaning at all in Sanskrit
language - that you will get your Realization.

185
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,460
All right, anybody says so, must you join
him? You should have asked, “How do you

186
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,549
get these words? From where did you find them?”

187
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:43,690
You should have asked Mr. Freud, “From where
do you get your knowledge?” He, himself,

188
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:49,519
was a drug addict. He, himself, was a horrible
man. He had bad relations with his mother.

189
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:56,519
He had a cancer, and he becomes your guru
instead of Christ? Suddenly, and you accept

190
00:27:58,129 --> 00:27:58,769
him.

191
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:05,769
Those people who deal on mental level cannot
talk of God. They cannot understand God. God

192
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:14,999
can be only understood through your Spirit.
Like your theologians here – theologians

193
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:22,540
– what do they understand about Christ?
They haven’t got power to talk about Christ.

194
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:33,179
Just because they are elected, they are just
paid servants of the people to look after

195
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:40,019
the churches, that’s all. They don’t deserve
to be saints. Why are they so important? At

196
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:47,019
least in India nobody treats them as something
great. They are just priests, finished.

197
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:54,580
You have to be a saint to understand God.
You have to be a realized soul to understand

198
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:02,759
His miracles. You cannot just become a theologian
in a theology school or somewhere and start

199
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:11,249
talking about God. It’s blasphemous the
way these people talk about God and Christ.

200
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,909
I don’t know how you tolerate it. In India
they would have been stoned and finished long

201
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:26,909
time back. They don’t know what God is,
how can they know about Christ? It has been

202
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,590
on and on from this Augustine time and this
Paul also another horrid fellow. I don’t

203
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:43,590
know how they call him as Christian, from
where he becomes Christian. And that now they

204
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:49,110
are not following Christ, they are following
Paul.

205
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:56,110
Theologians, intellectuals cannot understand
God. He’s beyond your limited intellect;

206
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,869
He’s an unlimited personality. You have
to jump into that. With your limited knowledge

207
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:09,869
you can play your horses of your politics,
not of God. Such arrogance, such ego! You

208
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:20,779
are challenging the wrath of God on your countries
when you go about like this.

209
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:28,879
Please humble down yourself and understand
that God is beyond your petty intellect. First

210
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:36,659
become your Spirit. You have to become your
Spirit. By reading if you understand God,

211
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:50,299
then he’s not God. It’s clearly said “Atmanave
Atmana Tattwa”. You see, through the Spirit

212
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:58,610
you will know God. Christ has said it so clearly
to Nicodemas that “You are to be born of

213
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,090
the Holy Ghost.” And Who is the Holy Ghost?
These people who go to theological colleges,

214
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:11,090
are they Holy Ghosts or what are they? They
are nothing but ghosts of intellect.

215
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:18,850
Beware of them. This is another very subtle
attack on reality. And they all will have

216
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:27,989
to suffer for it, they must understand. You,
those who are seeking, should seek your Spirit

217
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:38,230
and should understand that you are invited
in the Kingdom of God. The time has come;

218
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:45,379
this is the judgment time. This is the judgment
and you can see it so clearly.

219
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:55,929
So there is attack on the seekers. One, from
ignorance because they don’t know what to

220
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:03,639
seek, how to seek, what to expect; and there
is attack also from outside because they think

221
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:13,629
you are ignorant, because they think they
know more than what you know. They don’t

222
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:22,169
know anything about Christ, believe Me - Who
He was, why He came on this Earth, and how

223
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,559
He plays His role so perfectly within ourselves.

224
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,720
I would request you all to receive your Realization
first. There’s no argument about it; there’s

225
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:47,049
no discussion about it. Even if you try to
argue it out – I may be able to answer you,

226
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:54,799
but that won’t give you your Realization,
your Kundalini has to rise. Humble down in

227
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,669
your heart.

228
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:03,669
I went to a village where about three thousand
people came from all hills of Himalayas, very

229
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:15,419
simple people. And they were waiting for this.

230
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,379
I asked them, “How is it you were waiting?”

231
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:27,379
“Oh, it is said. It’s said it, that Devi
Jagaran will be there in modern times. We

232
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,759
were waiting for You to come, Mother. Devi
Jagaran is the awakening of the Goddess, of

233
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,309
the Kundalini.

234
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:43,309
The villages know about it. On the foothill
of Himalayas they are waiting. In one day

235
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,110
I got three thousand people realized. In this
Birmingham, how many people there are today

236
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:54,239
who are new, who have come to receive their
Realization? Very few. But theologians get

237
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:59,200
all these lectures. They like to play with
their mental projections.

238
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,200
But beware, time is very short. Better get
your Realization. Become the Spirit and then

239
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,720
you will know that God is not intellect, It
is love. And love which is not limited – unlimited

240
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:25,770
love which is the most powerful thing in this
universe which you can become aware of and

241
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:41,889
you can become empowered with that great,
unlimited love which just flows, acts, coordinates,

242
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,869
thinks, plans, works out everything. This
All-Pervading Power about which you have heard,

243
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:53,869
you have to know That and get It. You can’t
pay for It. You can’t organize It. It has

244
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:05,700
to work out like a living process within you.

245
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:14,109
May God bless you.

246
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:21,109
I would like to know if you have any questions.
[Shri Mataji says aside, “Ice, I don’t

247
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:37,190
take ice. It is very cold water.]

248
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:46,569
Come along, come forward. There are lots of
seats here. Who are sitting at the back, come

249
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,040
along. Sit at here.

250
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Can you hear Me? Is it all right? Have you
any questions? Come along, this side. There’s

251
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:15,020
room this side. Don’t sit on the ground.
There’s room here this side. Any questions?

252
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:40,099
Question: A man asks if it helps to be a vegetarian.

253
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:53,780
Shri Mataji: No, no. It has nothing to do
with vegetarianism or not. Christ was not

254
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,569
a vegetarian. It’s all absurdity. Of course
you have to eat whatever suits you. I would

255
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:04,569
say that – whatever suits you. This vegetarianism
is a fad. It’s just a fad. To believe that

256
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:13,950
by eating some food you’ll go to God is
a wrong idea. But, of course, alcohol goes

257
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,869
against your awareness, you know that. But
I don’t say, “Don’t take alcohol.”

258
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:26,410
You will just not take it, that’s all, because
you get the alcohol of God within you and

259
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,010
then you don’t want to take it. That’s
a different point. But I won’t say just

260
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,440
now that “Don’t take it.”

261
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,190
But food has to be seen whatever’s suitable
for your body. I would say that Indians should

262
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,369
take to meat. It would be better. And the
Western people should take to vegetables,

263
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:49,369
it would be better for them, just to balance.

264
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:02,450
Question: How do you become your Spirit?

265
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Shri Mataji: That’s a very good question.
That’s the question is - I’m saying it

266
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,490
is a spontaneous happening and that within
us is placed, if you see here in the triangular

267
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:48,490
bone, is the power of Holy Ghost within us,
which we call in Sanskit language as Kundalini.

268
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:56,460
In Koran it is called as Assas. In every scripture
it is described. And this Kundalini has to

269
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:06,890
rise, this power which is the desire power,
which is the pure desire power, because all

270
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,920
other desires are not pure. If they were pure,
then you would have been satisfied. But you’re

271
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,750
not satisfied.

272
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:23,750
So this pure desire is the desire to become
one with the Spirit. And this is within you,

273
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:31,230
this force is within you dormantly placed
in the triangular bone called as sacrum. That

274
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:38,230
means the Greeks also knew the word sacrum
means “sacred.” And this power has to

275
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:46,319
rise within you, and there are subtle centers
above it, six centers above and one center

276
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:53,770
below through which it pierces and you feel
the Holy Ghost, which is described by Christ

277
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:01,770
and you feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost
coming out of your fontanel bone area which

278
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:09,200
is the real baptism. And as a result of that
you start feeling your Spirit in your consciousness,

279
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,710
means in your central nervous system. You,
yourself, feel it.

280
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:28,710
That’s how you become the Spirit. That’s
the only way it is sprouted. It’s a living

281
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:42,049
process like if you want to sprout a seed,
you have to embed it into this Mother Earth

282
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:51,690
and spontaneously with the power what Mother
Earth has, it sprouts. In the same way it

283
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:58,690
happens, and that’s how I have to work it
out. But later on when you get it and you

284
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:03,480
become established, you can do it yourself
to others. Like one enlightened light can

285
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,480
enlighten another light. But the first light
has to be enlightened.

286
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:18,230
For that you can get some books from here,
but once you start reading books also I find

287
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:25,710
you become more bookish, so it’s better
to postpone the reading for some time. Better

288
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:32,150
get your Realization first. Like I would say
that when you want to put lights on you say,

289
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,380
“All right, switch on.” It’s all built
in there; it’s all done. Only thing you

290
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:43,380
have to switch on. And the whole thing becomes
enlightened. But I could first of all tell

291
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,200
you all the details about the history of electricity,
then all the organization that has worked

292
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:57,200
it out - would be a headache. Better have
your light first.

293
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:05,890
And then you’ll know all about it. And this
is not I’m saying that is today. Has been

294
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:17,030
said for thousands of years. That is how we
become the Spirit. Christ didn’t tell us

295
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:25,069
lies when He said that “You are to be born
of the Holy Ghost.”

296
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,400
He never said that any priest can put his
hand on your head and say, “Now you are

297
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,400
a Christian.” Did He say so? He did not.
That’s all artificial. That’s why children

298
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:47,130
cry such a lot when they’re baptized, I
think. Like William Blake has said that “A

299
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,220
priest cursed me on my head.”

300
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Any other question, please?

301
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:16,640
Now we have to work it out. It’s very simple
and it will work out in no time. It works

302
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:38,750
out. It will happen to you in no time but
the problem is, it’s a new experience and

303
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:50,230
people actually think that when you get an
experience you must jump or you should become

304
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:57,859
like a mad person. I don’t know what things
are expected.

305
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:04,859
You become empowered, and unless and until
you use this power how will you know you’re

306
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,559
empowered or not? So to establish that power
you take some time. Once you have established

307
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:18,559
that power then you can see yourself how you
are blessed, that how this power is flowing

308
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:27,650
through you of God’s compassion, that how
you are blessed in every way and how you,

309
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:38,230
yourself, become the source of joy – to
yourself and to others. How you jump into

310
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:44,740
a new awareness of collective consciousness
by which you can feel the problems of others

311
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,549
and your own problems, how you can cure your
problems and cure the problems of others.

312
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:57,549
For this you have to have patience with yourself
for a little while and once you’re established

313
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:05,809
you will see that you, yourself, become your
own master, your own guru.

314
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:16,910
So to achieve it, we have to do few things
is to understand that we have to have, first

315
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:29,020
of all, desire. You and your freedom cannot
be challenged. So you have to have intense

316
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:37,740
desire to be the Spirit. If you have that
desire in your heart, it works much faster.

317
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:46,470
To express that symbolically we put the left
hand like this which represents the power

318
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:54,400
of desire and the right hand is the power
of action. We have to take out our shoes because

319
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,839
the Mother Earth helps us a lot. We have to
take out our shoes to take some help from

320
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,089
Mother Earth. Thank God here it’s not concrete,
slightly better than that.

321
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,950
To put both the feet on the Mother Earth in
a parallel manner, and be comfortable - you

322
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:57,200
have to be comfortable. Now supposing somebody
is feeling uncomfortable because of something

323
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,760
that’s tight on the neck or on the waist,
please loosen it a little bit if you find

324
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,520
that. But if you’re comfortable, it’s
all right. Or somebody has got a coat which

325
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,980
is making one uncomfortable, you can take
it out.

326
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,849
Attention should not be distracted towards
some discomfort to the body. That is important.

327
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:09,849
Secondly, if you can take out your spectacles
will be better because here you don’t have

328
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:17,240
to see anything, you have to keep your eyes
shut.

329
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,250
So please put both your feet on the Mother
Earth, your left hand towards Me like this,

330
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:22,500
with the desire in the mind that we have to
be the Spirit. We are not yet complete till

331
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,530
we become the Spirit; we are not complete
to understand God Who is absolutely complete.

332
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:24,170
Now the right hand is to be used for the action.
That is on the different centers we have certain

333
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,780
problems. In a village I don’t have to do
all this. You’ll be surprised, it’s just

334
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,130
like this, (Shri Mataji clicks Her fingers)
just like that. I don’t have to do anything

335
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:27,420
whatsoever. But we are little complicated
so doesn’t’ matter. We have to remove

336
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:27,730
our own hurdles by putting our hands into
different things. [Shri Mataji speaks aside

337
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,760
in Hindi] Please put your shoes at the back.
Now, you have to keep your eyes shut, but

338
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,880
before that I’ll tell you the different
centers we’ll try to clear out. One is on

339
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,650
the heart because heart reflects the Spirit.
So that’s why one.

340
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,730
Then secondly we’ll have to put our hand
on the upper part of the abdomen on the left

341
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:34,480
hand side. The whole thing we are working
out on the left hand side because here resides

342
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,000
the center that governs the mastery. Then
below that is the center that governs the

343
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,250
true knowledge, the pure knowledge.

344
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:35,579
Then here is the center on the left hand side
which is very important, because this is the

345
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:35,829
center where when we feel guilty, condemn
ourselves, try to show that we are sinners,

346
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:35,970
we are good for nothing, a blocket is built
up. And that blocket is very common in the

347
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:36,140
Western people, surprisingly. Whatever you
may say there is ego, this blocket of feeling

348
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,280
guilty is too much. They all the time feel
guilty for everything that is nonsensical,

349
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:36,420
or maybe little sensible also, but mostly
nonsensical. So a blocket is built. That’s

350
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:36,549
how you develop this angina troubles and you
develop other troubles like spondylitis and

351
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:36,690
all that. So this is a very important point.

352
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,109
At the very outset you must know that you
are not guilty of anything, and God’s power

353
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:42,619
of forgiveness is so great that He can wash
up whatever wrong you have done. He’s quite

354
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:42,869
capable. So don’t try to condemn yourself.
Know that you are the temple of God and the

355
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:42,940
Light has to come within you. That’s all.

356
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:43,059
So the hand has to be here, push back when
I tell you. Then the hand goes here - is the

357
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:43,059
center here is very important of Christ which
is in the center of optic chiasma. The center

358
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:43,059
of Christ is there where you have to forgive
others. At the back is the center where you

359
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:43,059
have to ask for forgiveness, just to get over
your guilt. And then you have to put your

360
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,200
hand on top of the fontanel bone area which
is the soft bone in your childhood. Put your

361
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:43,329
palm, just please put it just on top of that.
Stick out your fingers, press it hard and

362
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:43,329
move it seven times clockwise when I tell
you.

363
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:43,329
So this is what we have to do ultimately and
then you will see that the Cool Breeze will

364
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:43,329
be coming out of this fontanel bone area.
You have to certify yourself and then you

365
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:43,329
start feeling the All Pervading Power of God’s
Love as Cool Breeze around you, on your fingertips.

366
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:43,329
You have to know on your fingertips. Nobody
else has to certify. You have to certify yourself.

367
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:43,900
So now first of all we close our eyes. At
the very outset we have to tell ourselves

368
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,289
that we are not guilty.

369
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:45,059
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi] These
are uprooted people from India so you shouldn’t

370
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:45,309
worry about them.

371
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,039
Please have your right hand on your heart.
Keep your eyes shut. Please have your right

372
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:48,039
hand on your heart. On the heart is on the
left hand side above the stomach. Heart. Higher,

373
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:48,309
it’s higher. Now, at this point you have
to say, or you have to ask Me a question,

374
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,559
in your heart.

375
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:49,400
“Mother am I the Spirit?” Ask this question
three times. If you want you can call Me “Shri

376
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,650
Mataji” or you can call Me “Mother”,
whatever suits you.

377
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,750
“Mother am I the Spirit? Mother am I the
Spirit?” Ask the question three times.

378
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:49,920
Now, put this right hand on the left hand
side in the upper part of your abdomen. Please

379
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:50,109
put this right hand, your fingers, press them
in, on the left hand side, in the upper part

380
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:50,299
of your abdomen, that is stomach. Now , this
is the center of the mastery. Keep your eyes

381
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:50,490
shut. Now as you are the Spirit, you are your
own guide.

382
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:50,609
So now ask the second question, “Mother,
am I my own master?” Three times. “Mother,

383
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:50,780
am I my own guide?” “Mother, am I my own
guru?” Ask a question within yourselves.

384
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:50,950
Three times.

385
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:50,970
After asking this question please don’t
open your eyes, and put your right hand – left

386
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,589
hand to be all the time towards Me and the
right hand in the lower part of your abdomen

387
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:52,920
on the left hand side. Please put your right
hand in the lower part of your abdomen, your

388
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,339
stomach, on the left side, on the left side.
Press it hard.

389
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:54,589
Now this is the center of our true knowledge.
As I told you, you are free, I cannot force

390
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,839
things upon you. So please, you have to ask
for it. The true knowledge of Divine Power,

391
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,839
how it works, here you have to ask six times,
“Mother, please may I have the true knowledge,

392
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,839
the true technique? May I have the pure knowledge?”
Ask the question six times, please.

393
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,839
Keep your eyes shut, please. Don’t open
your eyes. Ask this question with full confidence,

394
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,839
please. Keep your eyes shut, please, all of
you.

395
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,839
Now, with your asking the Kundalini starts
getting alert. The Power of Desire wants to

396
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,839
ascend. So you have to make proper seats or
arrangements for the Kundalini’s rise. So

397
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,940
what do you do is to put your hand now on
the upper center that is placed on the left

398
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,190
hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part.
Now, in the upper part of your stomach, on

399
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,250
the left hand side you place your fingers.
Now press them.

400
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,280
Now here you have to say with full confidence,
that the Kundalini wants to rise but you show

401
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:55,339
your full confidence by saying ten times,
because this center has got ten petals, ten

402
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,390
times. “Mother, I am my master. Mother,
I am my guide. Mother, I am my own guru.”

403
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,440
Please say it with full confidence.

404
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:55,460
This is the place is created by all the great
masters, satgurus as they are called, within

405
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,510
us. They have to be awakened by this confidence
that you say. Ah. Ten times, please.

406
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:55,569
[Shri Mataji rubs Her hands together and blows
on Her palms]

407
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,599
Now raise your right hand on to your heart.
On the left hand side it is. Please raise

408
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:55,660
your right hand on to your heart. Now here,
with full confidence again in yourself, you

409
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:55,710
have to say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.”
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

410
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,760
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit.”
Twelve times. Because you are, but have confidence.

411
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:55,799
Don’t feel guilty.

412
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:55,809
As I told you, God is the Ocean of Love. He’s
the Ocean of Compassion, but above all He’s

413
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:55,869
the Ocean of Forgiveness. With full confidence,
please say, “Mother I am the Spirit” twelve

414
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,920
times.

415
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,920
Now, with full confidence again, put your
hand on your neck on the left hand side from

416
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:55,980
the front, from the front. Don’t take it
backwards because is easier from the front.

417
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,030
And push it towards the back. Hold it tight,
hold it tight. Here is the problem where you

418
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
have to know that you are not guilty at all.
Here with full confidence please say sixteen

419
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
times, “Mother, I am not guilty.” Please
say it sixteen times with full confidence

420
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
in Me, yourself. You’re not guilty at all.
Believe Me, you’re not guilty of anything

421
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
– is all conditionings and all kinds of
things, the norms that people have created,

422
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
is all their mental projections. You’re
not guilty at all. Believe Me. But if you

423
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
still think you are guilty, you better have
punishment of saying it hundred and eight

424
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
times.

425
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
You have to be pleasantly placed because you
have to enter into the Kingdom of God. You

426
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
have to be pleasant about it. Not to be disgusted.
Now, sixteen times please say, “Mother,

427
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
I am not guilty at all.” Believe Me you
are not guilty.

428
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
From your heart please say, “I am not guilty.”
Believe Me. Believe Me.

429
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
Now, now raise your hand to your forehead
across and press it on both the sides as we

430
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
do when we have headaches. Now here you have
to say from your heart, from your heart, “Mother,

431
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
I forgive everyone.” But this is from your
heart. How many times is not the point.

432
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,250
Now some people say that’s difficult to
forgive. But it is again a mental idea that

433
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:56,460
we forgive someone, or we don’t forgive
someone. Actually, we don’t do anything.

434
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:56,500
But when we don’t forgive, then we play
into the hands of people who want to do us

435
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,559
harm.

436
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,559
So put your hand on top of your forehead across,
forehead across and say, “Mother, I forgive

437
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:56,619
everyone” from your heart. Please say it.
You wanted to have your Realization, isn’t

438
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:56,660
it? Please, go ahead with it. Otherwise then
you’ll say “We didn’t feel it.” Come

439
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:56,710
along. As you asked the question, please go
ahead. Everybody’s doing it. What’s so

440
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:56,750
special about you? Just do it. Otherwise you’ll
say, “We didn’t get Realization.” Then

441
00:46:56,549 --> 00:46:56,799
I’m not responsible. You are here to get
your Realization. Be sensible. What are you

442
00:46:56,589 --> 00:46:56,839
going to lose?

443
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:56,849
If you are seekers, please do it. [Shri Mataji
rubs Her hands together] It’s not proper

444
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:56,900
that you should watch others. It’s not civil.

445
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:56,930
Now put your hand on top of your head. Here
– we have missed one center because I don’t

446
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:56,990
think you need to do that one where you have
to ask for forgiveness – but just put your

447
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:57,039
hand on top of your head and press it hard
on the fontanel bone area and move it in a

448
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:57,109
clockwise manner. Here now, again, I cannot
cross your freedom, so you have to say, “Mother,

449
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:57,160
please give me my Realization.” Seven times.
“Please give me my Realization, I want it.”

450
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,210
I cannot force it.

451
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,220
Place your hand on top of your head, top of
your head, on the top, and press it hard,

452
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,280
and move it. Now, seven times. Now, bring
down your hand, please. Slowly open your eyes.

453
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:57,329
Slowly open your eyes. Now see, there are
no thoughts in the mind. Just see for yourself.

454
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:57,380
Watch Me without any thought. Just watch Me.

455
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,410
Put your left hand on top of your head. Left
hand. And right hand towards Me, and see if

456
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,470
there’s a Cool Breeze coming in. Just move
it up and down. It’s very subtle. Here,

457
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,520
here. Here, the fontanel bone is here. All
right? It’s very subtle.

458
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:57,559
Now, change your hand. Put your left hand
towards Me. See with the right hand. [Shri

459
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:57,609
Mataji blows into the microphone]

460
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:57,619
Now change, see it with the other hand. Carefully.
Without thinking. [Shri Mataji blows into

461
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:57,670
the microphone] Feeling it? There’s a little
breeze coming out. Are you? Little bit here

462
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:57,720
in front.  
Now, those who are feeling the Cool Breeze,

463
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:57,750
raise both the hands. Let Me see. Those who
have not felt, should not. You should be honest

464
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:57,809
about it. All right.

465
00:46:57,569 --> 00:46:57,819
Now, all of you raise your hands and ask a
question, “Is this the Breeze of the Holy

466
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:57,880
Ghost?’’ Ask a question three times. “Is
this the Breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Now,

467
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:57,930
put your hands like this. See if It is coming
in your hands also. It’s a very subtle thing.

468
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:57,990
It’s very subtle. Now, put down your hands
and see are you feeling It in your hands,

469
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:58,039
some sort of a cool breeze. If you are not
feeling, doesn’t matter. We’ll work it

470
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:58,089
out. Doesn’t matter. Don’t get upset.
All right?

471
00:46:57,869 --> 00:46:58,119
Now those who have come for the first time,
please raise your hands because people will

472
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,170
come and see you if you are feeling the cool.
First time. Please raise your hands. Are you

473
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:58,220
feeling the Cool Breeze. No? You are? All
right. Now those who have come for the first

474
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:58,280
time, please raise your hands because people
would like to see you. All right. Just see.

475
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:58,329
Now, we have here people who have got Realization,
who are established people and they would

476
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:58,380
like to see if your chakras are all right
because they’ll just feel your Cool Breeze.

477
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:58,430
Now the thing is, this is what, exactly what
happened to Christ’s disciples. When they

478
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:58,480
felt the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, they
started using their hands because the chakras

479
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:58,530
and all that, they could feel raising of the
Kundalini and they started talking in the

480
00:46:58,329 --> 00:46:58,579
terms of the centers. So people thought they
were mad. Because this is a new language,

481
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:58,630
a new subject for them. So people thought
they were mad. Exactly the same way you will

482
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:58,680
also feel everything on your fingertips.

483
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:58,700
Now, don’t think about it. Again, I would
request you to raise your both the hands those

484
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:58,760
who have come for the first time so others
could come and feel it, if there is a Cool

485
00:46:58,569 --> 00:46:58,819
Breeze coming out of your head or not. If
it is not coming, doesn’t matter. All of

486
00:46:58,619 --> 00:46:58,869
you who have come for the first time, who
have come for the first time, please raise

487
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:58,930
your hands. Is important because they will
all take over.

488
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:58,960
Come along. Forward. You have? You have come
for the first time? All right. You’ve come

489
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,010
before? All right. Doesn’t matter. You raise
your hand. Raise your hand. Also, those who

490
00:46:58,809 --> 00:46:59,059
have not felt the Cool Breeze, raise your
hands. All right.

491
00:46:58,839 --> 00:46:59,089
Can you have a look now? Some of you should
go and see. Now the lady who asked Me a question,

492
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,160
Adita can you see her? She didn’t do anything
and she had neighbors who didn’t do anything

493
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,210
at all. So just see if she’s felt the Cool
Breeze. She has felt it. This lady has come

494
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,270
for the second time, she said. Just see her,
Danny. Liver. Liver. Let her put her right

495
00:46:59,079 --> 00:46:59,329
hand, left hand on the liver.

496
00:46:59,089 --> 00:46:59,339
Now don’t think about it. You cannot think
about it. You try to remain in thoughtless

497
00:46:59,150 --> 00:46:59,400
awareness. [Shri Mataji says aside “ May
God bless you.”] Just see this gentleman

498
00:46:59,190 --> 00:46:59,440
who came for the first time, this gentleman.
Yes. See him, if he’s felt the Cool Breeze

499
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,490
on his head. Now I have to request you one
thing – that, though you have felt it, you

500
00:46:59,299 --> 00:46:59,549
have to establish it. Now don’t waste your
Realization. See these people, all of them,

501
00:46:59,349 --> 00:46:59,599
they have got their Realization, they’re
helping people, that’s how we have to save

502
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,640
this world. And now you will know that what’s
the meaning of your life, why are you here,

503
00:46:59,450 --> 00:46:59,700
what’s the purpose.

504
00:46:59,460 --> 00:46:59,710
Did this gentleman come? You felt it? Still
see him. They have got? He’s got it, you

505
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,760
can see so clearly. Eyes start sparkling.
Hah. Is it better? It’s better now. You

506
00:46:59,559 --> 00:46:59,809
think too much. Don’t you? All right. For
that what is to be done she’ll tell you.

507
00:46:59,609 --> 00:46:59,859
It’s very simple to get rid of it. [Shri
Mataji speaks in Marathi and Hindi]

508
00:46:59,660 --> 00:46:59,910
Just see. Kalab [not sure how to spell this
name], just see him.

509
00:46:59,700 --> 00:46:59,950
There are some new people here? Are there?
Some Sahaj Yogis should come and see this

510
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,000
side. Have you come for the first time? No.
No. You are Sahaj Yogis. Just see here. Some

511
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:00,059
Sahaj Yogis should come and see there. Come
along. Um. Better? Better. Don’t think.

512
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:00,099
Just don’t think for awhile. Ah. Is he all
right? Ask him to keep his eyes open. More

513
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:00,160
on the left. More on the left. Right to the
left you should put it. Right to the left.

514
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:00,220
Yah. Better. These two ladies here. All right?
Good. How many beautiful people there are

515
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,270
in this world, just see. You have to just
find them. Hah. It’s better with that, very

516
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:00,319
beautiful, isn’t it? That’s the fact.
That’s the fact. They are beautiful. Ah.

517
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:00,359
Better. Flowing better. [Shri Mataji talks
in Marathi and Hindi] All right? It’s good.

518
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,410
[more Hindi]

519
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,410
Down below, little. Pat, there’s a gentleman
in front of you here. Just see what about

520
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,470
him. One ahead. Here. No, in there all right.
Yes, this gentleman. Just find out about him.

521
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:00,520
Yes, please find out. Next to that one.

522
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:00,539
Did you feel the Cool Breeze? Beg pardon?
What did he say? He didn’t feel it? Should

523
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:00,599
feel it. What do you say? It’s all right.
Next to that one also. He’s got it. He’s

524
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:00,660
got it. Keep your eyes open, please. Just
watch Me without thinking. Just watch Me without

525
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:00,710
thinking. Hah. Better. [Shri Mataji laughs]
Don’t think. Don’t think. With thinking

526
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:00,740
you cannot be there. This is the first mantra,
first chanting, “Don’t think, don’t

527
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:00,789
think.” By thinking we reach nowhere. [Shri
Mataji laughs again] It’s maddening, I tell

528
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:00,829
you.

529
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:00,839
The lady who asked the question, how is she?
She’s what? Hah. Good? That’s very good,

530
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:00,890
Ian.

531
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:00,890
Those who have come today and are not yet
attended to, please raise your hands. Anyone.

532
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:00,940
Hah. Great. You’ll knock down ten years
at least. Ten years younger, minimum. I am

533
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:00,990
sixty-three years of age, Myself. I might
be the oldest among all of you. Good? It has

534
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:01,039
nothing to do with age or anything. Good,
he’s got it, you can see.

535
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:01,089
These ladies also, they have got it. All right?
Good. Thank you very much, all of you. May

536
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,140
God bless you.
