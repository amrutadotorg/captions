00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:14.320
It's a great honor for me to be allowed
this opportunity to say a few words to you

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:26.642
about my own experience of Sahaja yoga and
perhaps, what I went through, may be of

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:31.191
some interest to the other members of the
Indian Administrative Service, in particular.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:41.250
I recall that, very early in the 1970's
She began Her spiritual movement and She

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:50.849
told me one day, that by raising the Kundalini
of individuals, people could be transformed

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:59.094
and you know being a bureaucrat, I took
it with two pinches of salt. I said,

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:05.787
"How on earth can anyone transform human
beings?" For I had no idea as what Kundalini

00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:12.627
was but She told me, "This is the inherent
power in every individual which can be raised

00:01:12.627 --> 00:01:20.661
and if it can be raised, then people get
transformed." Now imagine me, in a dilemma

00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:25.529
I said, "I don't know, I've never seen 
anyone transformed. I've worked very hard,

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:30.622
I've been a good model but I have not
succeeded in transforming anybody." So I,

00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:36.556
honestly I tell you, I didn't quite believe
it in the beginning. Then, She persisted,

00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:41.610
She went along by Herself - I gave no
support to Her at that stage. Then, I got

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.834
transferred to London - I got elected
to a job there in UN as

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:51.167
Secretary General of Maritime Organization
and there something happened. I'd taken up

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:58.514
residence in Surrey, little outside London
- I used to commute - and we were together

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:10.313
there, my wife and I and one day, when I
returned home at about 8:30 pm, I went in

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:18.087
and went to drawing-room, where usually
She would wait for me and there I saw a

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:25.943
young man in his late 20's, sitting on a
sofa; He was a white-skinned person, reading

00:02:25.943 --> 00:02:31.656
a newspaper and I was little amazed, I said,
"Who, who is he, why is he here anyway?"

00:02:31.656 --> 00:02:37.657
but what bewildered me was the fact that
he was wearing my clothes. So, I said that

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:41.774
"There's something wrong with me, I'm seeing
an apparition," but anyway, I retraced my

00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:47.313
steps, came back to Her - She was in the
kitchen - and I said, "Now do I now see

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:52.113
really what I see?" and She explained to me. Then
She explained to me. She said, She had gone

00:02:52.113 --> 00:03:01.599
to Piccadilly Circus, there She saw a young
man lying, more or less, by the roadside,

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:08.624
uncared for, apparently very sick and so
She said, She went up to him and asked

00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:14.218
what the matter was? The young man
said, he was a, no one to look after him,

00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:18.695
he was very sick, probably suffering from
jaundice and a few other things, obviously

00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:26.042
under the influence of drug but She felt,
somehow, some compassion and said,

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:32.774
"Okay, would you like to come with Me, I 
can take care of you," and She asked him

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:38.809
to hop into the car, which he did and
that's how he was brought to our house.

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.834
I felt reassured that nothing had really gone
wrong with me that what I was seeing was true.

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:48.865
But I tell you, I was very happy. I said,
"Well, here's a person full of compassion."

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:56.514
She is a wanting to help a young man and
why not. It was at that point, at that stage

00:03:56.514 --> 00:04:03.197
then I began to see the miracle happening.
She treated that young man, with great

00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:09.927
deal of care and affection and love and Sahaja
yoga and the boy began to get transformed.

00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:19.507
He was addicted to drugs but he didn't want
anymore any drugs. He, his color changed.

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:29.535
In about 3-4 week's time he looked like a
fine young man and eventually we came to know

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:35.978
that he was an educated person, an Australian,
who was an engineer, who had run away from

00:04:35.978 --> 00:04:42.273
his house and country, taken to drugs in
London and was in a very bad way at that time.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:50.455
Now, he stayed with us for about 2-3 months
but he became like a beautiful flower and

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:55.293
he was very anxious to get back to his
parents in Australia and we were very happy

00:04:55.293 --> 00:05:03.368
that this happened and then I saw what Sahaja
yoga and what She had done to young boy.

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:13.167
After that, you know my bureaucratic questioning
mind ceased to function in that way.

00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:20.554
I began to accept there's far more to it in the
world than mere administrative capability.

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:25.698
There's something more, something higher,
something spiritual. The boy went back.

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:32.876
Can you imagine the delight of the
parents who got back their lost son?

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:38.932
Now that was first instance and then, I
said, "No, I have been wrong, I should have

00:05:38.932 --> 00:05:43.113
known better," but, you know, how it is. I
mean, some of you, who are in the service,

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:46.863
will know, we never accept anything 
unless it is proved three times over.

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:57.116
Well then it began to unfold itself. I saw
someone coming along, coming to Her for

00:05:57.116 --> 00:06:02.883
vibrations and for transformation and
you know, sitting opposite and people,

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:08.925
who were addicted to drugs till yesterday,
found that they did not have the urge to

00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:15.040
ask for drugs. People were alcoholics - 
She never asked anyone to give up anything

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.658
She said, "It is your life but you don't
give up drugs. Drugs get away from you.

00:06:19.682 --> 00:06:25.692
You don't give up alcohol, alcohol goes away
from you. You become a different person."

00:06:26.538 --> 00:06:31.328
Now, to some of the audience, I might
perhaps refer to what I always do when I speak,

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:39.349
the case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. You know, that
Mr. Hyde seems to disappear from you and

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:45.632
you become a total Dr. Jekyll. So, I've seen
many of that kind, a few in the beginning

00:06:45.632 --> 00:06:50.730
and later on quite a number and now over
thousands and thousands and thousands

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.983
all over the world. In 80 countries, I've
traveled with Her to, not all of them but

00:06:55.983 --> 00:07:02.116
some of them and it's amazing to see,
how they, they are becoming, sort of a,

00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:09.470
new class of human beings, motivated by
nothing except what is ethical, what is right.

00:07:09.844 --> 00:07:15.474
They don't bother about themselves, they
bother about others. All the time wanting

00:07:15.474 --> 00:07:21.307
to do something good, something right,
and I must say, She never, I mentioned

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:24.801
to that, She never says, "Give up
this thing." She's on the contrary,

00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:32.017
"Educate yourself, take a job but do
the job well," and wherever they are,

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:37.764
they make a difference. So, that is what
Sahaja yoga is doing. Now, has it affected me?

00:07:37.764 --> 00:07:43.864
You know, in the beginning I was a very
anxious person, you know, always wanting

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:49.652
to be five minutes ahead of time or on time.
If I'm slightly delayed, I'm a little jittery -

00:07:50.616 --> 00:07:56.356
you know how official life is, a lot of
tensions, if you are in the United Nations

00:07:56.356 --> 00:08:01.585
I'm dealing with a 150 governments and if you
have to deal with United States of America

00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:06.111
and Russia and China and what have you
- it does mean lot of strain or stress

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:12.477
but I assure you, ladies and gentleman,
after this experience of mine, I became

00:08:12.477 --> 00:08:17.124
a different person and mind you, it was
not, as if, I became careless - not at all

00:08:17.124 --> 00:08:21.693
I'm always punctual to the minute but
not with a strain, not with stress;

00:08:21.693 --> 00:08:28.319
I did not feel as if I was under any great
tension anywhere. You do your job and

00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:34.482
do your job as best as you can and
things turned out extremely well. So,

00:08:34.482 --> 00:08:39.942
this is the message that I wanted to give
my friends and colleagues the, it is a

00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:49.580
matter of your wanting to achieve that
much of transformation. If you are earnest

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.648
about it, you are sincere about it, as I
was, I feel it's possible to achieve that

00:08:54.648 --> 00:09:02.072
transformation and nothing helps in fighting
tension better than being transformed

00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:08.621
in this fashion. I have told you, She doesn't
want anyone to give up anything but I want

00:09:08.621 --> 00:09:13.603
to tell you something more. She Herself
doesn't give up anything. She is a great

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:19.380
spiritual leader but She is also a very great
wife and a very great mother and a very great

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.896
grandmother and now a very great, great
grand mother - four generations now.

00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:28.928
I tell you - I won't take too much of your
time, I get carried away sometimes -

00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:34.454
but once She was in Australia, I was in
London and She rang up our cook, from there,

00:09:34.454 --> 00:09:39.398
saying, "I hope you are preparing this
vegetable for him and that vegetable for him."

00:09:39.398 --> 00:09:45.119
Now, She is a wife, wherever She is
and She is a mother wherever She is.

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:51.945
The lesson is, 'Lead your life normally
but lead in a different way, when you get

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:56.754
concerned about the body, a lot of 
compassion, concerned about your country -

00:09:56.754 --> 00:09:59.516
not only just your country -
concerned about the world.'

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:06.776
She is building up a new human
society and I'm praising Her.

00:10:06.776 --> 00:10:11.340
I'm not embarrassed - doesn't matter, She's
my wife but I'm not praising Her for nothing.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.212
I'm saying, telling you what I've seen and
that's my experience. I hope you will have

00:10:16.212 --> 00:10:22.544
the same experience. Thank you very much.
[APPLAUSE] Before I sit down, I do want to

00:10:22.544 --> 00:10:27.609
refer to Mr. Ranade because wonderful
seeing him after many, many years.

00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:33.387
He's been a wonderful friend, a great
colleague and seeing him I go back to

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.900
20 years, 30 years. Thank you, my friend,
for your kind words.
