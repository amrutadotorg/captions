WEBVTT

16:09.377 --> 16:21.257
You see, here we are in the seminar and we
are all Sahaja Yogis and we are having a good

16:21.257 --> 16:26.817
time, we are cracking jokes, we’re discussing
things, etc., etc.

16:26.817 --> 16:32.867
But, this is all very well, I mean, one can
enjoy oneself, in fact one should enjoy oneself

16:32.867 --> 16:37.547
because the whole creation has been created
in such a way that we should enjoy ourselves.

16:37.547 --> 16:44.187
From the dawn of the creation, the Shri Adi
Shakti of the Universe has played out a drama

16:44.187 --> 16:50.057
using Her Deities, using all the powers that
She created, to create a Universe so beautiful

16:50.057 --> 16:55.707
that it should be possible for us to live
in it in complete joy and complete enjoyment

16:55.707 --> 16:56.707
of our existence.

16:56.707 --> 17:00.217
If one gives you an example…

17:00.217 --> 17:04.267
Yesterday we sat and we listened to ragas.

17:04.267 --> 17:08.618
These ragas themselves were inspired by the
Shri Adi Shakti in realized souls those who

17:08.618 --> 17:10.727
gave them to the world.

17:10.727 --> 17:13.786
The whole thing has been created by Her in
different aspects.

17:13.786 --> 17:22.087
So that we should enjoy ourselves and so that
we should not be miserable.

17:22.087 --> 17:23.757
And why does She want us to be happy?

17:23.757 --> 17:29.027
Because it is when you are happy and relaxed
than the power of God can work on you, to

17:29.027 --> 17:34.926
raise you to a great height for which you
are destined.

17:34.926 --> 17:42.157
You see, this whole drama that has taken place
is not a drama without purpose.

17:42.157 --> 17:46.997
Within it lies something that is profoundly
important and that something which is profoundly

17:46.997 --> 17:52.277
important is the awareness of God the Absolute
the Almighty.

17:52.277 --> 17:57.286
And this is the whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga.

17:57.286 --> 18:02.846
All the different techniques we use are a
bridge to this.

18:02.846 --> 18:07.687
You see, you have to understand what is Shri
Mataji on this Earth.

18:07.687 --> 18:08.906
She is the Adi Shakti.

18:08.906 --> 18:12.646
Now, how many people know what is the Adi
Shakti?

18:12.646 --> 18:16.456
The Adi Shakti is the power of God Almighty
Himself.

18:16.456 --> 18:22.307
It is the highest manifest thing in the Universe.

18:22.307 --> 18:27.676
When this thing takes Avatara in the Universe
for the first time, there must be a profound

18:27.676 --> 18:30.377
significance behind this.

18:30.377 --> 18:38.137
And this profound significance must be the
awareness of the Lord the Almighty.

18:38.137 --> 18:43.706
In your body are placed the various chakras
of the tantra.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.046
The instrument.

18:45.046 --> 18:47.066
Tantra means instrument.

18:47.066 --> 18:49.667
What are this chakras for?

18:49.667 --> 18:54.607
And people spend a lot of time cleaning them,
taking them out, putting them in salt water,

18:54.607 --> 18:56.206
putting them back again.

18:56.206 --> 18:58.706
But for what purpose?

18:58.706 --> 19:00.387
You see, you have to think for what purpose.

19:00.387 --> 19:04.196
Try to think why you are here instead of doing
things routinely.

19:04.196 --> 19:10.596
The chakras raise the awareness of the human
individual from step to step, higher and higher

19:10.596 --> 19:13.456
until it can reach the throne of the Almighty
Himself.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.566
That is their purpose.

19:15.566 --> 19:20.576
So, those who do not use it for that are like
a man who has a Rolls Royce who takes it apart,

19:20.576 --> 19:26.107
puts it in oil, puts it together again, starts
the engine and goes nowhere.

19:26.107 --> 19:32.657
You see, the whole tantras have been given
to you to raise your attention to the Absolutely

19:32.657 --> 19:34.107
the Almighty.

19:34.107 --> 19:37.506
The whole of Sahaja Yoga has been given to
you to raise your attention to the Absolute

19:37.506 --> 19:38.997
the Almighty.

19:38.997 --> 19:41.096
Your friends are given to you for this purpose.

19:41.096 --> 19:45.796
And the Shri Adi Shakti Herself has appeared
before you to give you this.

19:45.796 --> 19:52.576
Now, there is no doubt that Shri Adi Shakti
is Mahamaya.

19:52.576 --> 19:53.887
What does Mahamaya mean?

19:53.887 --> 19:56.817
And why is She Mahamaya?

19:56.817 --> 19:58.737
You see, you should question these basic fundamentals.

19:58.737 --> 20:03.967
After all, God is the Prime Architect of the
Universe.

20:03.967 --> 20:06.287
There is nothing that He does that is purposeless.

20:06.287 --> 20:08.927
You have to understand this.

20:08.927 --> 20:15.407
If we have purpose in what we do in our limitations
how much greater is His purpose?

20:15.407 --> 20:24.537
You see, if a long time ago, more than 1,400
years ago, Shri Adi Shankaracharya told human

20:24.537 --> 20:30.947
beings, “You are the Absolute, there is
no difference between you and God the Almighty,

20:30.947 --> 20:31.947
Adwaita."

20:31.947 --> 20:38.647
Now, if you are the Absolute, the Atma unless
you are diluted, there can be no creation,

20:38.647 --> 20:39.647
isn’t it?

20:39.647 --> 20:45.327
Because if you are always aware that you’re
the Atma Tattwa, how can you be involved in

20:45.327 --> 20:46.327
creation?

20:46.327 --> 20:50.127
You’ll always be lost in meditation on your
own existence.

20:50.127 --> 20:52.877
You have to understand this basic fact.

20:52.877 --> 20:58.447
So, the Mahamaya was necessary for the creation.

20:58.447 --> 21:02.197
She was necessary for the evolution of the
creation.

21:02.197 --> 21:06.467
Because by playing out dramas for you she
evolves you.

21:06.467 --> 21:10.107
And it’s only when you reach a certain level
that She can liberate you from herself.

21:10.107 --> 21:15.107
So, that you see beyond the Maya, the Absolute.

21:15.107 --> 21:21.057
Now, there is a saying in one of the Puranas
that, “The Devi can only be worshiped by

21:21.057 --> 21:23.917
those who are both, intelligent and brave."

21:23.917 --> 21:27.317
And She cannot be worshiped by the stupid
and the cowardly.

21:27.317 --> 21:32.347
This is very important, you see, we have been
given brains.

21:32.347 --> 21:35.877
We haven’t been given brains to sort out
trivialities of life.

21:35.877 --> 21:40.277
We have been given brains to chart our course
to the Almighty the Absolute.

21:40.277 --> 21:44.107
She is not going to spoon-feed you.

21:44.107 --> 21:48.517
Beyond a certain point you have to find the
course for yourself.

21:48.517 --> 21:53.197
The reason for this is that unless you do
so you are not worthy to be presented before

21:53.197 --> 21:54.197
the Almighty.

21:54.197 --> 21:58.447
Only those who are using their courage and
their intelligence, the strength of their

21:58.447 --> 22:04.077
desire can find the course, are worthy really
to come before Him.

22:04.077 --> 22:11.877
This is all part of the evolution of mankind.

22:11.877 --> 22:16.287
To understand and appreciate the Almighty
you have to have an awareness that is capable

22:16.287 --> 22:19.767
of receiving it.

22:19.767 --> 22:24.637
About two years ago Shri Mataji came to Riyadh
and I’ve written a Sanskrit poem which I

22:24.637 --> 22:25.807
presented to Her.

22:25.807 --> 22:29.717
And She began to complete it for me because
it was incomplete.

22:29.717 --> 22:34.957
And one of the verses was, “…how can I
pour all this into such small cups?

22:34.957 --> 22:35.957
..."

22:35.957 --> 22:39.977
You see, because the awareness, the brain
is not yet developed to the point it can take

22:39.977 --> 22:44.317
the radiation, the full weight of radiation
of the Almighty into it.

22:44.317 --> 22:47.087
So, how are you going to develop the brain?

22:47.087 --> 22:50.707
After all, the brain is the Agnya chakra.

22:50.707 --> 22:58.797
You develop the brain by focusing it on the
nature of the Almighty the Absolute.

22:58.797 --> 23:01.877
Contemplating it every day of one’s existence.

23:01.877 --> 23:06.277
In this way the attention goes up to it.

23:06.277 --> 23:07.867
And the nerves in the brain get refined.

23:07.867 --> 23:13.357
The petals of the Sahastrara get refined to
the point that they can receive the grace

23:13.357 --> 23:17.727
of the Absolute and His awareness.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.687
The Shri Adi Shakti is His Shakti.

23:19.687 --> 23:22.907
She is the power by which all things are done.

23:22.907 --> 23:26.016
She is the one who refine your brain for you.

23:26.016 --> 23:29.317
But you yourself have to put your attention
there.

23:29.317 --> 23:36.587
It is very easy in Sahaja Yoga because one
is left alone a lot to put one’s attention

23:36.587 --> 23:39.917
on trivialities.

23:39.917 --> 23:44.027
A chakra may catch.

23:44.027 --> 23:45.477
But what does it matter?

23:45.477 --> 23:49.977
The catch may release within five or ten minutes.

23:49.977 --> 23:53.707
So, why bother about it?

23:53.707 --> 23:56.607
That we know that the catches move from chakra
to chakra.

23:56.607 --> 24:03.097
That the movement of the kundalini moves from
chakra to chakra.

24:03.097 --> 24:29.597
So, what is the purpose of concentrating on
things that are trivial?

24:29.597 --> 24:34.526
In the past, you see, many great seekers came
on this Earth to seek God.

24:34.526 --> 24:35.677
After what are you seeking?

24:35.677 --> 24:36.927
What does seeking mean?

24:36.927 --> 24:38.487
It means to seek God.

24:38.487 --> 24:42.497
They had no Shri Adi Shakti to help them.

24:42.497 --> 24:44.977
You have it here in front of you.

24:44.977 --> 24:49.956
So, you should take advantage of it.

24:49.956 --> 24:58.367
And try and become fixed at that point which
is the Absolute.

24:58.367 --> 25:05.207
And you may all be here in a collective but
the relationship between you and the Absolute

25:05.207 --> 25:08.807
has to be individual between you and Him alone.

25:08.807 --> 25:12.206
And when you see Him, you don’t see anyone
else.

25:12.206 --> 25:13.336
You see.

25:13.336 --> 25:19.047
It is very good to be in the collective, it
is very good to be with each other to enjoy

25:19.047 --> 25:28.716
each other’s company but your relationship
with each other should be such that it fosters

25:28.716 --> 25:32.117
that ascent to the Divine the Absolute.

25:32.117 --> 25:33.896
We have to be very clear.

25:33.896 --> 25:37.857
The whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga is this ascent.

25:37.857 --> 25:43.437
The great Goddess Herself the Shri Adi Shakti
has a devotion to our Lord which is indescribable

25:43.437 --> 25:46.237
in human terms.

25:46.237 --> 25:50.936
The whole play between the Almighty and the
Shakti is something which is one of the profoundest

25:50.936 --> 25:56.406
mysteries of mankind and of the Creation.

25:56.406 --> 26:01.716
And the deepest desire of the Shri Adi Shakti
is the ascent of Her creation and Her children

26:01.716 --> 26:05.886
to the throne of the Almighty as an offering
to Her Lord.

26:05.886 --> 26:11.896
Just as we, when we present an offering to
Shri Mataji if there are flowers, we take

26:11.896 --> 26:15.227
out the worst flowers, we present only the
best, the most perfect.

26:15.227 --> 26:20.677
So, when the Shri Adi Shakti offers to Her
Lord Her Creation it is something at a level

26:20.677 --> 26:22.737
far removed from this.

26:22.737 --> 26:27.947
And only the most perfect that can be presented
before Him.

26:27.947 --> 26:28.947
You see.

26:28.947 --> 26:31.257
You have to understand this.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.198
As human beings we have no importance.

26:33.198 --> 26:41.256
Except, in so far as we play a part in this
play between the Lord and His Shakti.

26:41.256 --> 26:48.067
The entire creation can be discarded, if it
does not serve this purpose.

26:48.067 --> 26:53.586
Cause there are only two things which are
real in the Universe and that is the Lord

26:53.586 --> 26:54.586
and His Shakti.

26:54.586 --> 26:59.787
All else is superfluous to this and of no
importance.

26:59.787 --> 27:04.257
At the end of creation only those two things
will remain.

27:04.257 --> 27:11.016
So, you must not take lightly what is happening.

27:11.016 --> 27:14.406
You are the essential parts and pieces of
this drama.

27:14.406 --> 27:21.547
This very profound drama which is the basis
and the internal root of the Universe.

27:21.547 --> 27:26.557
Have you ever considered why the Mooladhara
chakra has four petals?

27:26.557 --> 27:28.946
What does it mean?

27:28.946 --> 27:30.137
Why four?

27:30.137 --> 27:36.227
It is four because if you combine the Lord
and the Shakti in the Sushumna where Their

27:36.227 --> 27:38.937
feet rest you will find four feet resting.

27:38.937 --> 27:44.607
It is the… that is why it is the ultimate
purity because it represents the combined

27:44.607 --> 27:50.436
feet of the Lord and his Shakti and that is
given as a throne to the son, Ganesha, the

27:50.436 --> 27:54.006
Lord, the Omkara to sit on.

27:54.006 --> 27:58.757
These things are very important, very profound.

27:58.757 --> 28:06.136
To be the seat of the play of the Lord and
Shakti one needs extreme purity, extreme wisdom

28:06.136 --> 28:09.227
and extreme awareness of what is happening.

28:09.227 --> 28:13.667
The whole purpose of this creation is that
and that alone.

28:13.667 --> 28:17.357
The creation was not made for you to iron
saris.

28:17.357 --> 28:19.406
To worry about your dhobi [laundryman].

28:19.406 --> 28:23.706
These are totally irrelevant.

28:23.706 --> 28:33.376
They won’t even last a century, leave alone
eternity.

28:33.376 --> 28:34.847
Nor is organization there.

28:34.847 --> 28:38.186
You can organize till you’re blue in the
face but unless the desire of the Absolute

28:38.186 --> 28:41.977
works you will not get another Sahaja Yogi.

28:41.977 --> 28:42.977
You have seen this.

28:42.977 --> 28:43.977
Many of you have.

28:43.977 --> 28:48.896
We had many wonderful experiences in the early
days when we turned up at empty halls in spite

28:48.896 --> 28:50.167
of massive publicity.

28:50.167 --> 28:53.706
You see, you do not do anything.

28:53.706 --> 28:57.256
Lord Krishna when He came He said, “You
do not do anything.

28:57.256 --> 28:58.776
I do it all."

28:58.776 --> 29:01.847
So, the human being who deludes himself into
thinking he is doing.

29:01.847 --> 29:02.847
He is not doing.

29:02.847 --> 29:03.997
He said, “Act!

29:03.997 --> 29:05.997
You have to act.

29:05.997 --> 29:09.686
But leave the results of your actions to Me."

29:09.686 --> 29:16.646
So, act without expectation is what He is
saying.

29:16.646 --> 29:20.507
Now, how are you going to awaken?

29:20.507 --> 29:24.047
What you are going to do?

29:24.047 --> 29:28.316
You see, when one acts, everyone knows what
the left side is what the right side is.

29:28.316 --> 29:32.417
One acts by the right using the power of desire
of the left.

29:32.417 --> 29:35.017
This is something that is well known to everybody.

29:35.017 --> 29:38.227
Through which chakra does one act?

29:38.227 --> 29:39.567
Which is the chakra of activity?

29:39.567 --> 29:42.507
Who will answer it?

29:42.507 --> 29:43.507
Of creation?

29:43.507 --> 29:48.937
You must all know this, it’s basic stuff.

29:48.937 --> 29:49.937
The Swadhisthana.

29:49.937 --> 29:50.937
Ok.

29:50.937 --> 29:53.136
The Swadhisthana is on the right, is it not?

29:53.136 --> 29:54.506
And the Shuddha Ichha is on the left.

29:54.506 --> 29:58.516
So, what is the bridge between the desire
of God the Almighty and action?

29:58.516 --> 30:00.066
It is the left Swadhisthana chakra.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.066
Correct?

30:01.066 --> 30:04.956
And that is why all boots go and sit there.

30:04.956 --> 30:07.307
To disconnect your action from your desire.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.366
Very simple, you see.

30:09.366 --> 30:17.806
Wherever the boots hit hard you must know
that is an important chakra.

30:17.806 --> 30:25.357
Now, you see, although we are human beings,
we are by the grace of God enlightened souls.

30:25.357 --> 30:31.357
This means that the entire tantra of the Universe
is present in miniature within us.

30:31.357 --> 30:35.377
This Shri Mataji has done and She said, “I’ve
placed you there.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.506
Now, what you do with yourself is your affair."

30:37.506 --> 30:45.427
Now, as the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe
… Does everyone know what the Shuddha Ichha

30:45.427 --> 30:46.427
is?

30:46.427 --> 30:49.116
The Shuddha Ichha is the pure desire of the
Universe.

30:49.116 --> 30:50.767
Now, what is the pure desire of the Universe?

30:50.767 --> 30:55.006
The pure desire of the Universe is God, the
desire of God Almighty Himself.

30:55.006 --> 31:00.456
As this flows through the Ida nadi of the
Universe and is carried by the Goddess Shri

31:00.456 --> 31:05.776
Mahakali to be placed, deposited within the
kundalini.

31:05.776 --> 31:12.487
So, this flows within your left side or can
flow within your left side if you desire it.

31:12.487 --> 31:13.906
To inform your activities.

31:13.906 --> 31:19.836
Now, you see, unless you are connected your
activities are without meaning.

31:19.836 --> 31:24.056
It is like ants scurrying around not knowing
what they are doing.

31:24.056 --> 31:27.867
So, first, one has to establish within oneself
the pure desire.

31:27.867 --> 31:30.966
Let it flow within your Ida nadi.

31:30.966 --> 31:32.576
How would you do that?

31:32.576 --> 31:34.037
It’s very simple.

31:34.037 --> 31:38.247
You pray to Shri Mataji and you say, “You
are the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe and

31:38.247 --> 31:42.186
I worship You as such."

31:42.186 --> 31:46.737
If you just do that, pray to Her, pray to
Her, is this, She will flow with such force

31:46.737 --> 31:52.206
within your Ida nadis that She will break
anything that is in your left Swadhisthana

31:52.206 --> 31:54.316
and flow into the right.

31:54.316 --> 31:57.186
To inform your activity.

31:57.186 --> 32:03.006
You cannot catch on the right side if your
left side is strong.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.006
You see.

32:04.006 --> 32:06.797
So, that is the first stage.

32:06.797 --> 32:11.016
If you do that the Shuddha Ichha, you don’t
need to do more than this, the Shuddha Ichha

32:11.016 --> 32:16.057
will flow through all your chakras, it will
eventually break open the barriers that are

32:16.057 --> 32:24.446
in your brain and infuse with enlightenment
and nectar every nerve fiber and cell within

32:24.446 --> 32:25.446
your brain.

32:25.446 --> 32:31.886
As it does that your whole consciousness and
awareness will be altered.

32:31.886 --> 32:37.987
As it is altered your awareness will be filled
with the awareness of the Absolute.

32:37.987 --> 32:43.186
As it is filled with the awareness of the
Absolute you will see Shri Mataji clearly

32:43.186 --> 32:46.907
for what She is which is the Shakti of God
Almighty Himself.

32:46.907 --> 32:50.977
We will not say, “Shri Mataji did this,
Shri Mataji did that,” you know, all the

32:50.977 --> 32:52.317
Maya and the play.

32:52.317 --> 32:55.037
Some people fill tragic one minute, happy
next…

32:55.037 --> 32:56.577
This is all nonsense.

32:56.577 --> 33:02.586
If you are based in yourself you will remain
absolutely stable in the sight of your parents,

33:02.586 --> 33:04.347
in the sight of the Almighty.

33:04.347 --> 33:07.437
You do not shift from day to day.

33:07.437 --> 33:08.447
You don’t doubt yourself.

33:08.447 --> 33:12.767
You cannot become Nirvikalpa until you know
this.

33:12.767 --> 33:17.367
Because part of the Nirvikalpa is not just
doubting God or Shri Mataji.

33:17.367 --> 33:18.887
It’s very easy not to do that.

33:18.887 --> 33:22.377
It’s not doubting yourself as an extension
of Them.

33:22.377 --> 33:27.067
Because as Shri Mataji said, She has made
every single one of us into a part of Her

33:27.067 --> 33:28.067
body.

33:28.067 --> 33:32.937
So, to doubt oneself is in a sense to doubt
Her.

33:32.937 --> 33:39.707
Now, people try to avoid recognizing what
has been done to them by getting Realization

33:39.707 --> 33:42.217
in Sahaja Yoga.

33:42.217 --> 33:44.787
You don’t want to see that they have been
made a part of the body of God Almighty Himself

33:44.787 --> 33:46.387
in a sense of His Shakti.

33:46.387 --> 33:51.897
Because this means that you can’t behave
in the same old ways you used to behave.

33:51.897 --> 33:58.647
You can’t be attached to the same old things
which you used to be attached to.

33:58.647 --> 34:30.177
You have to change, you see.

34:30.177 --> 34:31.177
Ready?

34:31.177 --> 34:32.177
Ok.

34:32.177 --> 34:37.027
And this is something that people don’t
understand.

34:37.027 --> 34:40.537
And this is an avoidance of Sahaja Yoga, this
is running away from it.

34:40.537 --> 34:44.687
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is the fact that
people have been …, human being has been

34:44.687 --> 34:50.307
taken, they have been given realization, they
have been made part of the body of the Divine

34:50.307 --> 34:54.857
and they have been given the opportunity to
raise their awareness to the highest level

34:54.857 --> 34:56.027
to attain God realization.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.637
That is it.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.247
It’s very simple.

34:59.247 --> 35:06.177
Everything else is a waste of time.

35:06.177 --> 35:10.027
And one has to recognize that although we
may be Sahaja Yogis we do not run the Universe;

35:10.027 --> 35:12.127
the Universe is run by us.

35:12.127 --> 35:16.687
I mean, run for us by the Almighty.

35:16.687 --> 35:20.887
And run by us for the Almighty.

35:20.887 --> 35:24.947
We cannot decide this has to happen, this
has to happen, we have to have twenty people

35:24.947 --> 35:25.947
next week.

35:25.947 --> 35:27.207
Cannot happen.

35:27.207 --> 35:35.407
God decides how many people He wants, He decides
where and when, you just have to be instruments.

35:35.407 --> 35:40.537
Not one of us can change the Universe even
so much.

35:40.537 --> 35:46.377
Unless we do it in the… on the crest of
a wave which precedes from the Almighty and

35:46.377 --> 35:48.517
work as instruments.

35:48.517 --> 35:55.267
The old days of siddhic Yogis who ride on
clouds and transform mountains and hurl thunderbolts

35:55.267 --> 35:56.807
are over, you see.

35:56.807 --> 35:59.077
That was meant for people who are right sided.

35:59.077 --> 36:01.337
Who wanted to do things themselves.

36:01.337 --> 36:02.927
That is not us.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.437
We are parts of the body of the Goddess.

36:05.437 --> 36:08.527
And each one of us has to be like e nerve
cell.

36:08.527 --> 36:11.377
When the brain tells us what to do, we have
to do it.

36:11.377 --> 36:16.077
As such we are all collective.

36:16.077 --> 36:17.147
That is the true collectivity.

36:17.147 --> 36:21.397
And if we… each of us recognize that we
are a nerve cell in the brain of the Goddess,

36:21.397 --> 36:27.367
permeating Her whole being then the whole
boundaries between nationalities, and this

36:27.367 --> 36:29.847
and that which keeps Sahaja Yogis apart dissolves.

36:29.847 --> 36:35.867
We all realize we are one, we are the same,
that each one of us is individual and each

36:35.867 --> 36:39.127
one of us has an individual relationship to
the Almighty.

36:39.127 --> 36:43.807
And all sorts of misidentifications fall away.

36:43.807 --> 36:50.887
Now one speaks a common language, no doubt
about it, it is real.

36:50.887 --> 36:52.357
And this is the common language of vibrations.

36:52.357 --> 36:58.097
If you are there you do not know how but you
communicate with people who have a different

36:58.097 --> 36:59.097
language.

36:59.097 --> 37:01.647
It’s so simple really.

37:01.647 --> 37:07.427
So, I wish really in this lecture to make
you aware of what is been given in Sahaja

37:07.427 --> 37:08.427
Yoga.

37:08.427 --> 37:14.277
What has been done by the Great Goddess in
Her absolute nature and for what purpose.

37:14.277 --> 37:20.887
So that you do not waste neither time nor
energy on other things.

37:20.887 --> 37:23.297
There is nothing greater than this.

37:23.297 --> 37:30.457
And since the Goddess Herself is All Powerful,
beyond time, beyond everything.

37:30.457 --> 37:38.557
So, your awareness has to be of a nature that
can comprehend that and be one with that awareness.

37:38.557 --> 37:42.157
You can become one with Her in awareness,
no doubt.

37:42.157 --> 37:44.897
And see things as She sees things.

37:44.897 --> 37:48.307
But for this your brain has to develop, you
see.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.427
So, this is what one has to do.

37:51.427 --> 37:55.017
And really the rest of it is not important.

37:55.017 --> 37:58.287
At that level, it doesn’t matter how time
passes.

37:58.287 --> 38:01.687
At that level, it doesn’t matter whether
there are miracles or not because the whole

38:01.687 --> 38:04.847
concept of a miracle is non-existent.

38:04.847 --> 38:07.207
Everything follows the desire of the Absolute.

38:07.207 --> 38:11.677
Who makes the rules that arbitrates between
a miracle and a non-miracle?

38:11.677 --> 38:13.047
Humans beings.

38:13.047 --> 38:15.087
It’s not God.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.567
For God there is no such things as a miracle.

38:17.567 --> 38:19.787
Everything is possible to Him.

38:19.787 --> 38:29.907
So, what I’m saying is hitch your awareness
higher, hook it at the higher level, keep

38:29.907 --> 38:30.907
it there.

38:30.907 --> 38:34.637
So that you see really what is happening.

38:34.637 --> 38:40.267
And do not, in spite of everything that has
been given, continue to move in the same circles,

38:40.267 --> 38:44.507
low circles that one inhabited before one’s
realization.

38:44.507 --> 38:46.029
This is very important.

38:46.029 --> 38:51.937
This is so important that I don’t know how
to say it.

38:51.937 --> 38:59.017
Work to increase the structure and capacity
of one’s brain, so that you can comprehend

38:59.017 --> 39:02.837
that which is Absolute.

39:02.837 --> 39:10.687
I do not know if there is anything more to
say to this.

39:10.687 --> 39:16.917
I remember once a long time back when I first
met Shri Mataji, Gregoire was there, lots

39:16.917 --> 39:19.097
of other chappies were there jumping around
with me.

39:19.097 --> 39:24.147
I remember one, early one morning after we
slept with Her in a flat in London, I was

39:24.147 --> 39:28.347
talking to Her and She says… you see…
we were talking about Maya.

39:28.347 --> 39:30.487
And I said, “Mother, I wish I could go beyond
Maya."

39:30.487 --> 39:35.497
And She said to me, this was some seven or
eight years ago, and She said to me, “One

39:35.497 --> 39:37.777
day you will, you will catch me."

39:37.777 --> 39:42.937
She said, “You will catch me."

39:42.937 --> 39:49.347
And what I’m trying to say, is that this
is what we should all aim for.

39:49.347 --> 39:51.307
Try to go beyond that.

39:51.307 --> 39:56.577
And you can only go beyond that when you can
touch the feet of the Absolute.

39:56.577 --> 40:01.437
The Absolute is like a mountain peak which
raises above the clouds.

40:01.437 --> 40:05.787
You cannot rise above the clouds until you
rest on that mountain peak.

40:05.787 --> 40:11.387
So, you cannot rise above Maya, it is impossible
until your awareness touches the feet of the

40:11.387 --> 40:13.137
Absolute.

40:13.137 --> 40:20.047
Because above Maya there is nothing but the
Absolute, The Atma Tattwa.

40:20.047 --> 40:30.287
You know, the Atma Tattwa rests in the Heart
of God the Almighty and ascends to dance in

40:30.287 --> 40:33.017
the Sahastrara as Sadashiva.

40:33.017 --> 40:35.597
So, the heart is a very important organ.

40:35.597 --> 40:40.557
Rajabhai said that when Shri Mataji gave him
realization, She said, “You young men have

40:40.557 --> 40:45.137
such hard hearts."

40:45.137 --> 40:46.287
And She was true in the sense.

40:46.287 --> 40:47.707
Most people do have hard hearts.

40:47.707 --> 40:50.107
Not necessary their fault.

40:50.107 --> 40:54.877
It may be the result of their experiences
in this world.

40:54.877 --> 40:56.337
But one’s heart should be like a lotus.

40:56.337 --> 40:58.607
I don’t know how many of you have touched
a lotus.

40:58.607 --> 41:02.497
But the petals are so soft, like silk.

41:02.497 --> 41:08.417
The heart of a man should be as soft as that.

41:08.417 --> 41:14.027
You see, we have got our realization regardless
of everything we have done.

41:14.027 --> 41:19.927
By the grace of God, the Almighty, by His
compassion, profound compassion, profound

41:19.927 --> 41:23.587
love for mankind, for the children of His
Shakti.

41:23.587 --> 41:27.837
He has granted – He says forget everything,
forget it, forget it.

41:27.837 --> 41:30.077
Forgive, you see, I forgive them.

41:30.077 --> 41:31.207
I forgive them.

41:31.207 --> 41:35.057
We have to be the same in our hearts to the
rest of the mankind.

41:35.057 --> 41:39.887
When the disciples of Christ, Peter I think,
once came to Christ and asked them: “How

41:39.887 --> 41:42.067
often should I forgive my brothers, seven
times?”

41:42.067 --> 41:43.937
And He said, “No, seventy times seven."

41:43.937 --> 41:51.157
And what He meant was infinitely.

41:51.157 --> 41:54.957
You see, one cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi,
this is my belief, unless one is kind, and

41:54.957 --> 41:59.097
one is gentle.

41:59.097 --> 42:01.367
Kindness and gentle doesn’t mean weakness.

42:01.367 --> 42:07.617
It means being soft, trying to further the
other person from one’s heart, caring for

42:07.617 --> 42:10.737
what Shri Mataji once called in Her lecture,
caring for his hita [benevolence].

42:10.737 --> 42:16.287
Try to see what is… how to do that which
is best for him, how to manipulate him in

42:16.287 --> 42:20.367
such a way that he raises.

42:20.367 --> 42:27.597
It means, going beyond oneself, you see, when
someone is harsh with you, is he harsh with

42:27.597 --> 42:28.597
you?

42:28.597 --> 42:31.197
If you are Atma how he can be harsh with you?

42:31.197 --> 42:35.147
If you are the Atma you can bear it all.

42:35.147 --> 42:38.257
And in spite of that try and resolve.

42:38.257 --> 42:48.787
The only thing we cannot really be expected
to tolerate is any insult to the Goddess Herself.

42:48.787 --> 42:51.707
There we have to be strong and firm.

42:51.707 --> 42:56.617
But it doesn’t mean that we take justice
in our own hands.

42:56.617 --> 43:01.027
Justice is …, belongs to the Almighty, not
to us.

43:01.027 --> 43:03.377
Christ also said, “Judge not that ye be
not judged."

43:03.377 --> 43:07.007
Made it very clear, that we have no right
to judge.

43:07.007 --> 43:10.737
We are not going to be sitting there, at the
end writing out who should go to hell and

43:10.737 --> 43:12.157
who should go to heaven.

43:12.157 --> 43:14.957
It is going to be done by someone else.

43:14.957 --> 43:17.027
So, we cannot judge.

43:17.027 --> 43:24.397
We have to leave it to God to judge and for
us to execute.

43:24.397 --> 43:30.487
We cannot abrogate to ourselves any of the
qualities of the Almighty, such as justice,

43:30.487 --> 43:32.947
judgment, decisiveness, planning.

43:32.947 --> 43:35.387
These belong to Him.

43:35.387 --> 43:38.847
We merely execute these.

43:38.847 --> 43:47.327
But when we are kind to a fellow man, to any
living thing that moves, within the context

43:47.327 --> 43:53.507
of its dharma on this world, we make the Lord
happy.

43:53.507 --> 43:57.347
By this I don’t mean that one goes around
like jains, not trying to kill insects because

43:57.347 --> 44:00.437
it is in the dharma of the insects to be crushed
beneath the feet of man.

44:00.437 --> 44:04.777
We’ve been both created this way that it
has… it is an inevitable outcome of living

44:04.777 --> 44:05.807
a normal life.

44:05.807 --> 44:08.777
One doesn’t go crazy, you see.

44:08.777 --> 44:09.777
We have to eat.

44:09.777 --> 44:15.127
Chicken, I mean it doesn’t mean you don’t
slaughter a chicken to be kind to it.

44:15.127 --> 44:17.617
We have to live within the boundaries.

44:17.617 --> 44:22.467
But there is no place for unnecessary cruelty
in this world.

44:22.467 --> 44:25.887
The Lord is not cruel.

44:25.887 --> 44:30.707
And if we are to partake of his essence and
of his nature we have to be like Him.

44:30.707 --> 44:41.497
So, the message I’m trying to give you is
that in spite of all the splendor that surrounds

44:41.497 --> 44:46.567
the Goddess and there must be because She
is, after all, the Shri Adi Shakti, do not

44:46.567 --> 44:51.578
forget that the deepest desire in our heart,
the Shuddha Ichha, is to raise you to the

44:51.578 --> 44:58.347
feet of Her Lord as offerings worthy of Him.

44:58.347 --> 45:07.887
And in all Her drama She tries constantly
in Her movement to bring you to that point.

45:07.887 --> 45:11.227
And I tell you that there is nothing else
in the Universe worth bothering about except

45:11.227 --> 45:12.877
this fact.

45:12.877 --> 45:20.697
If you love your Mother try to be worthy to
be offered by Her to Her Consort.

45:20.697 --> 45:30.577
And if you love your Father try to be worthy
to be offered to Him.

45:30.577 --> 45:36.387
And if you love Them both this will work out
inevitably because Their love will work through

45:36.387 --> 45:45.377
your heart, and the two will mingle, and you
cannot help but ascent.

45:45.377 --> 45:48.157
Live by your hearts not by your brains.

45:48.157 --> 45:53.157
That is not by your egos and superegos and
question the inner desires of your heart.

45:53.157 --> 45:54.157
Do not question them.

45:54.157 --> 45:55.197
You cannot question them.

45:55.197 --> 45:58.117
They are beyond logic.

45:58.117 --> 45:59.117
Live by your heart.

45:59.117 --> 46:06.477
If you express your heart you will lead to
such a sense of satisfaction with life that

46:06.477 --> 46:08.897
you cannot be angry with anyone.

46:08.897 --> 46:14.047
You will be so happy all the time that it’ll
be effortless for your Parents to lift you

46:14.047 --> 46:18.607
to that level which was your destiny at the
moment of your creation.

46:18.607 --> 46:20.817
That is all I have to say.

46:20.997 --> 46:26.077
Jai Shri Mataji.
