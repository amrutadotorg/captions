00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:08.715
So, today is the second day of Navaratri.

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:16.595
I told you yesterday that first the auspiciousness

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:23.788
and the holiness was created through the creation of Shri Ganesha.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.448
So that this world is fulfilled with auspiciousness and holiness.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.550
We can see in the history

00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:38.136
that people in the olden times cared for auspiciousness

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:42.706
and were afraid of God, they had fear for God

00:00:43.097 --> 00:00:46.140
and they didn’t challenge God at all.

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:55.558
But gradually, the evil took over

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.741
and so this auspiciousness and holiness started

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.644
getting – not exhausted – but sleeping off.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.220
So Ganesha started sleeping, and as Ganesha sleeps

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:17.556
the people are not afraid of God.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.993
They think they can do what they like:

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:27.380
what can God do, after all, who is He? We don’t see it.

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:33.396
They also have no gratitude for what God has done for you.

00:01:34.138 --> 00:01:42.126
They have no gratitude about the blessings of this universe

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.115
that he was created, all the beauty that God gave you

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:56.868
because they’re ignorant and in ignorance they forget everything.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.599
Now the problem started more when Ganesha started sleeping.

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:11.892
With his power, people were afraid of God, they were righteous,

00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:17.302
they wanted to be good people, they didn’t want to commit sins,

00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.798
they didn’t want to do wrong things,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.539
they wanted to keep their attention clean

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.371
and put attention to good things.

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:32.527
Such people existed because you can see the temples,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.042
the big churches,

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:39.398
the big mosques that were built in the name of God.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:43.441
And they didn’t have so much money, nothing

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.229
but just out of devotion they did it.

00:02:46.664 --> 00:02:48.664
So, they had devotion for God.

00:02:49.164 --> 00:02:56.308
Another side was that people like we can say, the people

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:03.047
who were searching God were trying to find out the ways and methods

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:11.829
how they could reach God and there was such a big search.

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:16.923
They didn’t want material things, they didn’t care for it.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.880
I mean, for them, it was too low to think of it.

00:03:24.497 --> 00:03:27.855
But gradually so, it happened

00:03:29.073 --> 00:03:35.014
that these simple needs of life became very complicated,

00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:49.683
then first they had started to fight with each other.

00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:56.939
And then when they fight with each other it was out of selfishness,

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:03.136
it was all kind of uncollective temperament that they developed

00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:08.079
may be food, maybe some material thing,

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:12.242
all these things started crawling up into their ignorance.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.459
As a result, they became very blind

00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:27.047
and gradually they became sub-human, barbaric.

00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:33.607
So, the second phase started where

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:38.665
just after the vegetation and everything was created,

00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:45.521
the fire of the Mother Earth started coming out as an anger

00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:52.200
for these animals that they grew up,

00:04:52.572 --> 00:05:01.200
also were very-very dangerous type and were troublesome,

00:05:01.727 --> 00:05:04.340
who were in the evolutionary process

00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:07.504
were very-very big sized very big sized things,

00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:14.790
but not intelligent. Extremely cruel and big sized animals.

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:19.904
All these evolutionary processes start but before that,

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:32.872
only the Mother Earth’s fire started burning the stone inside.

00:05:33.654 --> 00:05:38.380
Because as I told you first it was taken nearer the Sun,

00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:41.251
this Mother Earth, and then towards the Moon.

00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:44.021
So that the upper crust, though it was

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:47.361
it had become cooled down and it had formed ice

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:52.786
and then it melted away into the water, still the inside,

00:05:53.573 --> 00:05:58.274
inside the ocean, the Mother Earth was very hot.

00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:01.665
And that She started coming out.

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:05.402
And when this heat started coming it burned

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:09.289
many trees and many stones,

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.423
with that burning, carbon was formed.

00:06:14.317 --> 00:06:20.580
Now, this carbon started absorbing

00:06:22.807 --> 00:06:25.945
all the gazes that were outside

00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:31.101
and purifying the atmosphere quite a lot.

00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:36.989
Plus, this carbon is the basis of our organic chemistry.

00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:40.426
So first the in-organic chemistry was there

00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:43.723
in the sense chemicals were produced

00:06:43.815 --> 00:06:48.804
and then with the carbon started the organic chemistry

00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:53.283
and that’s the beginning of life we should say

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:58.908
because then nitrogen it started absorbing

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:03.400
and they formed amino acids.

00:07:03.913 --> 00:07:07.580
These amino acids are the basis of life.

00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:10.959
So that is how the life started.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.904
But the first life grew in the water

00:07:15.138 --> 00:07:19.103
and you know the whole evolutionary process how it took place

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:22.400
in the second centre, Swadhisthana

00:07:22.615 --> 00:07:26.326
which had created all the universes and all that,

00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:34.529
all around in the Mother Earth there was water and

00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:40.330
on that surface of Mother Earth life started growing

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.572
then the evolutionary took place.

00:07:42.644 --> 00:07:46.146
Evolutionary process took place in this Bhavasagara,

00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:51.146
till we come to the human stage as I told you

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.861
there were animals first who came up

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.654
in the evolutionary process,

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:59.971
they grew up and they grew

00:08:00.124 --> 00:08:03.315
very big then they had to become small,

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:05.628
then they became very cunning,

00:08:05.706 --> 00:08:08.362
all kinds of things happened in the evolutionary process,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.315
left and right, right and left.

00:08:10.374 --> 00:08:13.147
Ultimately a human being was created

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:18.061
He too was in the image – not of God at that time,

00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:24.526
but in the image of an animal because the animal has – hum,

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:30.659
he has come from the animal stage,

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.827
but God created later man into the image of Himself

00:08:38.023 --> 00:08:43.999
in the sense is, out of these barbaric models –

00:08:44.195 --> 00:08:48.097
we call them we call them half-man, half-this thing,

00:08:48.214 --> 00:08:52.374
like you can say the monkeys becoming man.

00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:55.334
Then He created something –

00:08:55.769 --> 00:09:01.252
you can call it as Adam and Eve before, two models.

00:09:02.073 --> 00:09:06.077
So this was all done at that time,

00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:10.549
as you know that Adam and Eve are symbolic

00:09:10.862 --> 00:09:19.413
two personalities who wanted to know what is good and what is bad.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:24.413
And because of this urge to find out,

00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:27.749
that we can find, we can,

00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:32.922
also in the search of God many people think there’s no need to have

00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:37.394
any advice from any Realized soul,

00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:41.113
we can do it ourselves, what is the need

00:09:41.366 --> 00:09:45.468
to have Mother to tell us anything, we can do it ourselves.

00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:48.920
So they wanted to keep themselves on their own.

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.881
So God said: “All right, you go ahead.”

00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:55.600
And that’s how the circle started

00:09:55.757 --> 00:09:58.882
in the search of the truth. And as you know

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:03.030
we are here today enlightened.

00:10:04.038 --> 00:10:07.866
So then enlightenment has come to you,

00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:13.233
ultimately, but one had to go through

00:10:13.409 --> 00:10:20.147
the desert, the darkness of ignorance and then come to this stage.

00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:25.909
Then the state came in that we needed somebody to lead us,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:33.683
as somebody’s needed in the process of you can call it the

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:47.550
evolution, one fish came out and crawled and became a reptile,

00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:53.936
in the same way, you needed every time some leader to come out

00:10:54.249 --> 00:10:57.604
to raise you higher and higher and higher.

00:10:57.819 --> 00:11:02.444
So the first incarnation, I would say, was that of the Goddess.

00:11:02.874 --> 00:11:08.870
She was the first who came to lead people towards God.

00:11:09.163 --> 00:11:19.413
Because if you see in the Void, we have this chakra of Swadhistana

00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:26.854
and we have also the great Gurus, prophets who came

00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:32.967
to try to save human beings. But this was later.

00:11:33.417 --> 00:11:39.999
Before came the Goddess, to save people from

00:11:40.331 --> 00:11:47.967
all these ways of destruction.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.674
Some had become very evil

00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:55.131
people who were called as Rakshasas, devils

00:11:55.855 --> 00:12:00.796
and some were, had become good people.

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:08.389
Out of them then the Goddess created these great saints,

00:12:08.546 --> 00:12:10.846
they worshipped the Mother and they become

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:14.869
great saints then became incarnations of saintliness.

00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:20.021
So the first incarnation that ever came was that of the Goddess.

00:12:20.744 --> 00:12:27.107
And we see, on the second Yuga that we can call, She came.

00:12:27.322 --> 00:12:33.240
She came before Shri Krishna, She came before Shri Rama

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:41.619
and She saved people from getting drowned into Bhavasagara.

00:12:43.104 --> 00:12:48.748
This then created great saints and sages and Gurus

00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:53.357
who tried to save people.

00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:58.963
We have Gurus who were very great,

00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:03.591
I should say saints and very evolved,

00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:06.673
but also we had some who were right-sided,

00:13:06.908 --> 00:13:09.408
who knew all kinds of

00:13:09.565 --> 00:13:14.170
Vedas, they knew all kinds of sciences, they knew all kinds of

00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:19.912
– you can call them the divine weapons and things like that.

00:13:20.518 --> 00:13:23.228
And we also had left-sided

00:13:23.424 --> 00:13:27.287
Gurus who believed in the devotion,

00:13:28.973 --> 00:13:35.434
like you can say Moses was there, Abraham, Moses all these,

00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:40.941
people came who were left-sided, Muhammad was there,

00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:45.410
one of the last ones you can say and then Nanaka [Sainath].

00:13:46.182 --> 00:13:51.328
So came the devotion to God, devotion to the

00:13:52.213 --> 00:13:55.725
All-pervading Power started like this.

00:13:56.702 --> 00:14:03.928
So in this stage, that people tried to murder these

00:14:04.573 --> 00:14:07.088
great saints like Socrates, like

00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:09.822
we know everybody had to suffer so much

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.673
because nobody

00:14:13.454 --> 00:14:18.278
in the collective liked saints or goodness or righteousness.

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.122
That’s how we had fallen down so much

00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:23.466
at the time as you on the time

00:14:23.817 --> 00:14:26.792
of Moses what happened.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.590
And all these things

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.166
like “shariat” and all that has come from Moses,

00:14:34.262 --> 00:14:36.549
but the Muslims are following it.

00:14:37.315 --> 00:14:40.955
And that time it was such a bad decadent society

00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:45.135
that they had to use these methods

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:50.244
of very strong punishment or banishment you can call it,

00:14:50.502 --> 00:14:55.861
so that people were afraid not to do anything that is
sinful or else.

00:14:56.859 --> 00:14:58.765
But now they’ve taken up by

00:14:58.975 --> 00:15:01.929
the Muslims, the Muslims are using that scripture there,

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.451
they have no right, they are no saints,

00:15:04.498 --> 00:15:08.407
they’re not Gurus, nothing and they cannot use this.

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:11.148
But they started using it.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.192
But as you see our society, some of our Western societies,

00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:21.566
have really become very decadent and are going down.

00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:28.988
So now it is for us who are enlightened people to awaken others

00:15:29.168 --> 00:15:30.480
to reality

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.737
to make them face up to recede

00:15:33.987 --> 00:15:36.128
that where are they?

00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:40.080
In the name of pleasures, enjoyment, indulgences,

00:15:40.494 --> 00:15:42.572
how they’re destroying themselves?

00:15:42.784 --> 00:15:45.057
You have to talk to them, you have to tell them,

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.799
you have to awaken them and that’s why

00:15:46.886 --> 00:15:49.861
now we are going to protest also in Paris.

00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:58.478
The basic thing we have to understand,

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:02.727
that we have a very, very big responsibility.

00:16:03.643 --> 00:16:05.127
At the time

00:16:05.852 --> 00:16:10.502
when the Goddess incarnated, She had just to save people

00:16:11.393 --> 00:16:15.041
from the cruelties of these devils, that’s all.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:21.845
Because devils were on one side, Goddess was on another side.

00:16:22.017 --> 00:16:24.125
She was very powerful. She was killing

00:16:24.181 --> 00:16:26.719
all the devils and all demons.

00:16:27.212 --> 00:16:31.961
But now in modern times, it becomes a very delicate work

00:16:32.021 --> 00:16:33.880
because these devils have entered

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:37.294
into the brains of all the sadhakas.

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:42.185
I’ve seen even people who were born Realized

00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:44.224
were indulging into all kinds of

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:46.435
wrong things because of the society.

00:16:46.786 --> 00:16:48.708
So many went to horrible Gurus and

00:16:48.748 --> 00:16:50.723
they had those bhoots in their heads.

00:16:51.044 --> 00:16:54.325
So, it’s a very intricate operation one has to perform

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.746
to take out these things.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:00.809
And that lingers on and still, it puts doubts in their heads

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:04.262
and also curbs your strength to fight it.

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:09.918
But as Sahaja Yogis, you have a tremendous responsibility

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.249
and you must try to clear out yourself

00:17:13.842 --> 00:17:16.772
of all these conditionings, of all these

00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:20.217
wrong ideas that the society has spread so far.

00:17:20.592 --> 00:17:23.998
So, one side the evolution went wrong, now

00:17:24.295 --> 00:17:26.170
it has gone down.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.272
The decadence has started, people are just getting ruined

00:17:31.655 --> 00:17:36.326
and living with unnatural things, with materialistic things

00:17:36.928 --> 00:17:42.365
and people are becoming extremely selfish

00:17:43.256 --> 00:17:48.641
also deceitful, not afraid of God.

00:17:48.876 --> 00:17:52.899
Even the priests, even the churches, even the temples, even the

00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:59.327
mosques, all these people who are representing God are crooked.

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:03.218
They’re criminals, they’re not afraid of God.

00:18:04.578 --> 00:18:07.968
So, the first thing one has to understand that

00:18:08.951 --> 00:18:12.257
if we are not afraid of God,

00:18:13.294 --> 00:18:17.199
we cannot work out. Human beings only work under two circumstances:

00:18:17.394 --> 00:18:19.318
one either fear,

00:18:19.508 --> 00:18:23.369
either there should be fear or there should be some temptation.

00:18:23.572 --> 00:18:26.031
Otherwise, nothing can work out.

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:29.737
But the fear of God is the most important thing

00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:35.295
that we should not do anything that may displease God by any means.

00:18:35.965 --> 00:18:39.064
We have to be very, very careful on this point

00:18:39.283 --> 00:18:42.833
because first of all we are very complicated personalities,

00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:44.674
we’ve got these bhoots in our heads,

00:18:44.741 --> 00:18:47.486
we’ve got these ideas in our heads.

00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:52.620
Like in Germany when first, I think,

00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:54.994
Grégoire went there and told them that,

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:58.844
“You can’t have licentious life anymore, now you’re Sahaja Yogis “.

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:01.005
They said, ” Of course, we’re Sahaja Yogis

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:03.226
that dons’t mean we have given up our lives “.

00:19:03.338 --> 00:19:05.324
” You have to. You have to change “.

00:19:05.412 --> 00:19:08.443
So, three hundred people went away from Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:09.628
[Inaudible]

00:19:09.988 --> 00:19:12.661
But then came in Mr Aids,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.802
they were all panicked by this.

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:19.685
So, these warnings are coming to us

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.521
Thinking too much, dominating others, right sidedness,

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:29.402
now first time is leading you to yuppie stage.

00:19:30.012 --> 00:19:33.168
And in this stage, in this disease,

00:19:33.246 --> 00:19:36.144
outwardly nothing happens but you start reducing,

00:19:36.246 --> 00:19:40.129
you become like a reptile, people have to carry you on your back,

00:19:40.707 --> 00:19:43.507
just like a reptile, like a fish.

00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:49.637
Left-sided, you know already, you know the cancer and all these

00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:52.613
incurable diseases come from the left side.

00:19:53.263 --> 00:19:56.809
So, this onslaught I would say, such a big attack

00:19:57.122 --> 00:20:00.012
of the negativity is more felt in Kali Yuga

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.056
than anywhere before. Because now you have to think

00:20:04.228 --> 00:20:07.453
as to what is missing in our society,

00:20:07.557 --> 00:20:09.431
what we have to do about it,

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:12.626
and that we have got luckily this

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.514
Chaitanya with us.

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:17.724
How can we help society?

00:20:18.045 --> 00:20:21.279
So, we have to widen our vision and think about it.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.137
It’s not this time that

00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:26.371
only the Goddess has to save you from the evil.

00:20:27.624 --> 00:20:29.199
It’s much more than that.

00:20:29.567 --> 00:20:31.599
She has given you powers.

00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:34.316
And these powers are to be used.

00:20:34.629 --> 00:20:37.800
Instead of that if you are still lurking with all these old things,

00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:40.269
how can you have the powers?

00:20:42.363 --> 00:20:45.769
So, one of the Gurus, we should say one of the last Gurus was

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.573
Mohammad Sahab and then Nanaka.

00:20:49.254 --> 00:20:52.034
And both of them have said one thing

00:20:52.246 --> 00:20:55.738
is you must surrender. Islam means surrender.

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:59.066
You must surrender. But they don’t.

00:20:59.487 --> 00:21:02.941
I’ve seen people don’t surrender; they still stick onto things.

00:21:03.558 --> 00:21:05.925
Say, I told people you must put oil.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.038
They’ll not put oil.

00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:11.827
Because nobody puts oil so they’re not putting oil in their heads.

00:21:11.968 --> 00:21:13.460
Then they’ll become bald-headed,

00:21:13.546 --> 00:21:16.374
they come to me: “Mother we’ve lost our hair”.

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.905
You put on oil! I’ve told you to put on oil.

00:21:19.304 --> 00:21:21.975
Why don’t you put on oil? They won’t just do anything

00:21:22.124 --> 00:21:25.428
because the rest of the people don’t put on oil, we should not put.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.124
You are not them; you are different. Try to understand

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:32.960
you are not the other people. You are the leaders

00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:36.857
and you shouldn’t follow them, they should follow you.

00:21:41.499 --> 00:21:44.694
Instead of that, you are following all

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:50.155
the general opinion of the people and you want to live like them,

00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:52.219
then how can you be a saint?

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:56.966
A saint lives like the way
he has to live because he has the wisdom.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.052
And that is what you have to understand,

00:22:05.248 --> 00:22:07.880
that all these ideas have gone into your head

00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:10.435
and it’s a very dedicate operation for Me.

00:22:11.423 --> 00:22:12.930
Even to tell you something.

00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:15.579
If I tell something to the ladies they’ll start crying.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.459
If I tell something to men, they’ll leave Sahaja Yoga

00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:22.748
as if they’re obliging Me, is wrong.

00:22:23.186 --> 00:22:25.888
What you have to do is that God has chosen you

00:22:25.967 --> 00:22:27.638
to be the leaders of the people.

00:22:27.772 --> 00:22:31.334
To be the leaders. Do you know you are going to be the leaders?

00:22:33.232 --> 00:22:35.099
And then how a leader should be?

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:36.967
It should be a model.

00:22:39.586 --> 00:22:42.157
And that’s why in the Islam

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.407
or in Nanaka, praises complete surrender.

00:22:45.583 --> 00:22:47.935
What you surrender is nothing but this Ego and these

00:22:47.989 --> 00:22:50.177
conditionings, these nonsensical ideas.

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:53.036
And that you have to surrender.

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:55.589
That’s very important and surprisingly

00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:57.682
how Mohammad has said

00:22:57.769 --> 00:22:59.478
that Islam is to surrender,

00:22:59.572 --> 00:23:01.728
must be the reason he must be knowing

00:23:01.917 --> 00:23:06.328
that now ego is going to overpower the left side.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.291
We are not ordinary people.

00:23:15.892 --> 00:23:18.774
How many people know how to raise Kundalini?

00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:24.730
But still, I see people do not know on the feet where is the,

00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:27.433
where are the chakras are there.

00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:29.949
Simple, simple things they don’t know.

00:23:31.316 --> 00:23:32.855
I don’t know what time,

00:23:32.926 --> 00:23:35.355
where they spend their time, what do they talk.

00:23:35.715 --> 00:23:38.691
The other day I asked these Indian girls what are the

00:23:39.136 --> 00:23:41.590
stones that are for all these.

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:44.808
They didn’t know, I ‘m surprised, none of them knew.

00:23:46.762 --> 00:23:49.605
They’re Indians, I mean, I thought they should know all that.

00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:50.754
It’s all there,

00:23:50.894 --> 00:23:52.972
but they don’t know that. I don’t know what,

00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:55.964
morning till evening they’re talking but what do they talk?

00:23:56.371 --> 00:23:57.816
You should find out.

00:23:58.745 --> 00:24:02.862
It’s all I’ve said it, it’s all in the – in what you call this

00:24:04.674 --> 00:24:08.271
– on the tape, finished. That’s all.

00:24:09.216 --> 00:24:11.590
This knowledge should be in your brain

00:24:11.965 --> 00:24:14.841
and the vibrations should be in your hearts.

00:24:16.378 --> 00:24:18.557
So, Navaratri is a big preparation.

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:20.830
We have to know that

00:24:21.776 --> 00:24:24.346
the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga has to come into us,

00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:27.955
otherwise, why will people ask- think that you are saints?

00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:32.148
Nobody’s going to believe it

00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:34.226
that you are saints,

00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:37.245
in your behaviour, in your knowledge,

00:24:37.745 --> 00:24:39.939
in your dealing with others.

00:24:40.214 --> 00:24:44.050
In everything a Sahaja Yogi should be something outstanding.

00:24:44.925 --> 00:24:45.956
When I said,

00:24:46.094 --> 00:24:49.596
“You have become, you all have to become your own masters”.

00:24:50.034 --> 00:24:51.705
Then they use it the other way round.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.604
They tell the leader: “Now we have become our own masters”.

00:24:54.703 --> 00:24:56.063
It’s not the way.

00:24:57.646 --> 00:24:59.507
So, the first thing is wisdom,

00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:03.358
wisdom to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:03.507 --> 00:25:05.030
Assume the power.

00:25:05.398 --> 00:25:08.202
Sometimes I feel as if a

00:25:08.499 --> 00:25:11.562
beggar is made a king supposing;

00:25:12.601 --> 00:25:14.796
still he doesn’t assume his position.

00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:18.437
Anybody coming he says, “Can you give me one penny?”

00:25:18.914 --> 00:25:20.514
Though he’s a king.

00:25:22.584 --> 00:25:24.490
Something like that.

00:25:25.195 --> 00:25:28.484
Now you have to become the leaders of the world,

00:25:28.828 --> 00:25:30.500
all over the world

00:25:30.664 --> 00:25:32.984
and this is something to be assumed

00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:36.625
and felt. It’s not ego, it’s a reality.

00:25:38.344 --> 00:25:41.218
Because once you know that it is the reality

00:25:41.336 --> 00:25:43.164
you immediately change yourself.

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:47.304
Immediately you will think that, “Now, what are we doing?

00:25:50.414 --> 00:25:52.015
How much do we know?

00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:56.234
We are the leaders, the responsibility’s ours”.

00:25:58.102 --> 00:26:02.187
If that is understood, you’ll be surprised that

00:26:03.578 --> 00:26:08.398
nothing is needed to work out your cleansing.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.882
Just automatically it will work,

00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:14.890
that’s My blessing to you. Accept it.

00:26:16.586 --> 00:26:18.630
But you must

00:26:18.865 --> 00:26:22.232
feel that, “I have to be all right”, you have to feel it.

00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:26.709
The situation becomes helpless for Me sometimes,

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.611
if I tell something to somebody they’ll start crying

00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:32.205
or they’ll run away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:32.439 --> 00:26:33.626
So, what am I to do?

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.462
Should I leave you at the same stage as it is?

00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:38.992
Now, to save you from evil

00:26:39.258 --> 00:26:41.383
is not the same as to fight

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.359
Mahishasura or Narakasura, not that way.

00:26:44.828 --> 00:26:46.843
Because Narakasura is also gone into your head

00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:49.336
and Mahishasura is also gone into your head.

00:26:51.473 --> 00:26:54.089
So, the only thing one has to do is to understand, “There is

00:26:54.129 --> 00:26:58.128
this one in me, I ask that to get out”.

00:26:59.215 --> 00:27:01.128
Once you work it out that way,

00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:03.683
you are doing Navaratri itself.

00:27:04.285 --> 00:27:05.480
You have got powers,

00:27:05.566 --> 00:27:08.839
you have the knowledge, you know you can feel it.

00:27:09.098 --> 00:27:11.019
Just take out all these conditionings:

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.183
we are something different.

00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:18.332
You are not ordinary people.

00:27:22.793 --> 00:27:24.855
You are something very special.

00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:28.827
And why should we, at all,

00:27:29.062 --> 00:27:30.320
behave like others

00:27:30.406 --> 00:27:33.148
or like the way others behave? You’re not like others.

00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:37.562
And what a big thing you have, what a big knowledge you have!

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:40.093
Look at Christ, He was alone.

00:27:40.828 --> 00:27:44.038
He talked about what he wanted to say to multitudes, he talked.

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:46.703
He was crucified, still, He talked.

00:27:48.086 --> 00:27:50.077
Till the end.

00:27:50.773 --> 00:27:54.746
But He was knowledgeable

00:27:56.153 --> 00:27:59.433
and you might say that Mother he was an incarnation, all right.

00:28:00.425 --> 00:28:02.051
But in no way you are less now:

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.074
you know how to raise the Kundalini, you know everything.

00:28:06.176 --> 00:28:07.776
You are my children.

00:28:10.598 --> 00:28:12.566
So, I would suggest that

00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:15.082
to develop wisdom, you must meditate

00:28:15.192 --> 00:28:16.801
and be in the centre,

00:28:17.284 --> 00:28:18.761
so all these things will go away:

00:28:18.848 --> 00:28:21.418
just be away from this nonsense.

00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:27.202
In what atmosphere we live, what we do, it’s not important.

00:28:29.913 --> 00:28:34.381
We have to know that we are something exceptional.

00:28:35.054 --> 00:28:39.553
All the Ganas, all the angels are just waiting- [end of recording].
