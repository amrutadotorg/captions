615
00:48:02.669 --> 00:48:02.679
But.

616
00:48:03.739 --> 00:48:03.750
I.

617
00:48:08.179 --> 00:48:08.229
We didn't know.

618
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:26.000
Yeah.

619
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.270
Oh.

620
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.879
But

621
00:48:59.300 --> 00:48:59.310
And.

622
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.530
Aye.

623
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:19.810
Uh.

624
00:49:25.719 --> 00:49:25.729
Uh,

625
00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:26.020
I

626
00:49:28.989 --> 00:49:29.010
Huh.

627
00:49:41.989 --> 00:49:42.000
Go.

628
00:49:52.979 --> 00:49:53.330
I'm just

629
00:49:54.209 --> 00:49:54.550
Mm

630
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:55.679
oh no

631
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:57.320
no

632
00:49:59.629 --> 00:49:59.639
no.

633
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:08.870
Where are the bridesmaids?

634
00:50:11.659 --> 00:50:11.679
Right

635
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560
So.

636
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:23.060
La la la

637
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.209
The gala.

638
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:26.939
So

639
00:50:33.419 --> 00:50:33.429
Ah.

640
00:50:38.929 --> 00:50:38.939
Yeah.

641
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.360
the microphones

642
00:50:54.669 --> 00:50:55.760
This should be taken for them.

643
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:57.699
Yeah.

644
00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.149
Mike for them.

645
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:05.949
Excuse me,

646
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.189
Mother,

647
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:07.110
may we move them?

648
00:51:07.229 --> 00:51:10.379
Would that be too much to ask them to move because the mic won't reach,

649
00:51:15.379 --> 00:51:16.780
let it be there coming down.

650
00:51:19.939 --> 00:51:19.949
They

651
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.139
the generator will make a lot of noise,

652
00:51:33.229 --> 00:51:36.860
so the microphone will meet just here on the right in the shadow there.

653
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:53.629
I

654
00:52:02.649 --> 00:52:03.280
Thank you very much.

655
00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.060
Yeah.

656
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:10.510
No.

657
00:52:19.719 --> 00:52:19.729
No.

658
00:52:28.139 --> 00:52:28.149
It.

659
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:30.989
I don't want that.

660
00:52:33.189 --> 00:52:34.629
You all are looking very beautiful.

661
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:35.189
I,

662
00:52:35.389 --> 00:52:36.919

663
00:52:42.929 --> 00:52:44.610
All the brides are looking very nice,

00:52:44.689 --> 00:52:46.330

665
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:00.919

Come.

683
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.479
You'll be married now if you don't move that side a little.

684
00:55:08.379 --> 00:55:08.389
I.

685
00:55:12.649 --> 00:55:12.659

686
00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:20.020
So.

687
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040
I.

688
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260
And

So

695
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:08.899
You

696
00:56:15.889 --> 00:56:16.260
They get in there.

697
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:18.469
Yeah

698
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:20.010

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:21.129
I

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:23.360
Tabu

701
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:27.280
Apple.

702
00:56:31.229 --> 00:56:33.419
The boy should be brought from this side.

703
00:56:34.399 --> 00:56:34.429
and tell them

704
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:39.570
that they should find out their brides and sit accordingly.

705
00:56:41.979 --> 00:56:44.260
They see the brides and sit accordingly here,

706
00:56:44.469 --> 00:56:47.229
but they come this way to come fast.

707
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:48.489
They are taking too much time.

708
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:53.719
How this is only 2 hours.

709
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:59.879

00:57:04.199 --> 00:57:05.479
Who is in charge of it.

712
00:57:13.719 --> 00:57:13.830
2 hours of petrol generator.

713
00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:13.879

No.

722
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:10.129
And I don't cover your head too much,

723
00:58:10.179 --> 00:58:12.639
your husband would like to know where is my wife's city.

724
00:58:19.669 --> 00:58:19.679

00:58:19.689 --> 00:58:19.770

726
00:58:25.659 --> 00:58:28.020
You find out your wives and sit next to them.

00:58:30.989 --> 00:58:32.260
Find out your voices.

728
00:58:36.889 --> 00:58:36.899

729
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:40.840

00:58:58.899 --> 00:58:58.909

I got it.

739
00:59:13.639 --> 00:59:15.399
As soon as your husband's coming in,

740
00:59:15.409 --> 00:59:17.169
you better put up your finger.

741
00:59:18.639 --> 00:59:19.810
As soon as your

743
00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:23.270

Malas.

753
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.639
It will move this side so mamas could sit there.

754
01:00:31.939 --> 01:00:32.209
Oh.

755
01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:39.129
Just move this way a little bit

01:00:49.909 --> 01:00:49.919
Oh

Mama mba.

You got it.

So.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.770

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:16.479
chuckles.

774
01:06:16.489 --> 01:06:18.510
She's like that because of her it's good.

775
01:06:18.729 --> 01:06:19.669
What has happened is good,

776
01:06:19.689 --> 01:06:21.530
otherwise you would have got from her in trouble.

777
01:06:22.219 --> 01:06:23.610
But bitter we should finished.

778
01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:24.560
I'll manage it.

779
01:06:33.379 --> 01:06:34.139
Your mama.

780
01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:48.669
And.

781
01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.290

Ma.

783
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.310
Keep it on the sides.

784
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.909
Whatever things you have,

785
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.919

786
01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:17.610

Playing it

788
01:07:24.979 --> 01:07:26.419
I'm remembering my husband.

789
01:07:31.379 --> 01:07:31.899
My time's up.

790
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.409
He's teasing me.

791
01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:37.750
Because my husband is not here,

792
01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:38.659
so he's teasing me.

793
01:07:38.739 --> 01:07:39.780
They are playing for you.

794
01:07:50.959 --> 01:07:51.120
Yeah,

795
01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:51.350
I'm coming.

796
01:08:12.879 --> 01:08:13.000
It's clear.

797
01:08:20.259 --> 01:08:20.270
No.

798
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.319
I've just burnt the letter,

799
01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:24.490
mother,

800
01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:25.790
and I've just beaten shoes.

801
01:08:26.009 --> 01:08:27.919
I'm telling Paul Paul's getting involved.

802
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.479
Tell him not to bother,

803
01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:29.709
Paul,

804
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:29.919
Paul.

805
01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:40.127
Don't get involved.

806
01:08:40.538 --> 01:08:41.229
You're all right now.

807
01:08:41.528 --> 01:08:41.969
Just don't worry.

808
01:08:42.048 --> 01:08:42.528
Leave it to me.

809
01:08:42.608 --> 01:08:43.127
I'll manage it.

810
01:08:44.048 --> 01:08:44.167
Yes,

811
01:08:44.249 --> 01:08:44.769
it's all right.

812
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.259
With

813
01:08:58.779 --> 01:08:59.740
The indoors up there is.

814
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:02.930
I

815
01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:03.979
OK.

816
01:09:20.877 --> 01:09:20.929
Oh

817
01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:29.667
I don't know.

818
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.680
It

819
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:35.649
Must be you because.

820
01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:39.830
That that.

821
01:09:45.957 --> 01:09:46.828
plan rather than.

822
01:09:54.439 --> 01:09:54.819
When you go

823
01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:56.979
It's trying to

824
01:09:58.410 --> 01:09:59.850
What about your healthy?

825
01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:01.339
All right.

826
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.049
Now you find out the bride.

827
01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:08.879
There you go baby.

828
01:10:11.839 --> 01:10:13.129
Your bridegroom has come.

829
01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:16.299
He's your father,

830
01:10:16.649 --> 01:10:17.560
but it's all right.

831
01:10:17.629 --> 01:10:21.569
He has to do it now for he's trying to find out about.

832
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:27.220
Father will be needed at the time of the wedding.

833
01:10:30.069 --> 01:10:30.080
He

834
01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:40.240
Come along.

835
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:42.459
All the boys,

836
01:10:42.979 --> 01:10:44.569
boys are taking more time.

837
01:10:48.529 --> 01:10:48.549
I do.

838
01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.000
Please come along.

839
01:10:53.259 --> 01:10:53.600
Alexander now you.

840
01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:55.879
I

841
01:10:59.160 --> 01:10:59.500
Gregor,

842
01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:03.069
please tell them to find their own wives and sit down.

843
01:11:09.319 --> 01:11:10.640
I don't even know if they're married to.

844
01:11:12.629 --> 01:11:14.069
Why have they gone to the sea?

845
01:11:15.419 --> 01:11:17.580
This madness of sea is also too much,

846
01:11:19.259 --> 01:11:19.410
huh?

847
01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:23.000
they were

848
01:11:27.899 --> 01:11:28.330
they were going to the sea.

849
01:11:32.339 --> 01:11:33.640
But they can't do it here.

850
01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.580
What is the need to go to the sea?

851
01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.279
They should have done it.

852
01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:39.490
That's not proper.

853
01:11:39.569 --> 01:11:39.810
You see,

854
01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:41.549
to be arbitrary is not proper.

855
01:11:48.049 --> 01:11:48.149
Is he a bridegroom?

856
01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:48.240
We've got everybody's here.

857
01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.000
You see,

858
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.109
you should not do any arbitrary behaviour like going to the sea suddenly

859
01:12:05.839 --> 01:12:07.790
everybody's waiting for this to be done.

860
01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.509
The bride rooms,

861
01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:15.979
bride rooms,

862
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.029
the sang.

863
01:12:18.479 --> 01:12:18.899
quit

864
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.459
the bridegrooms or brides.

865
01:12:22.479 --> 01:12:26.390
You don't move out because it is going to be difficult for us.

866
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.350
Where is Bernard's wife?

867
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:33.379
Raise your hand.

868
01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:36.040
Where is Bernard's wife?

869
01:12:40.479 --> 01:12:40.680
mama mama.

870
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.589
That's it.

871
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.609
That's.

872
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:59.770
What is the need to go to the sea?

873
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.160
I.

874
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:12.290
she's in.

875
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.580
I think uh if you could put the camera here,

876
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.450
you could take the photograph of all of them better than

877
01:13:19.939 --> 01:13:21.580
now we have had enough of mine happen

878
01:13:26.939 --> 01:13:27.850
any enjoyment.

879
01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:29.700
Come inside,

880
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.729
come inside.

881
01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:43.250
He's a finder.

882
01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:45.950
You

883
01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:49.540
Absolutely.

884
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:53.979
Yeah.

885
01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.490
Now the big complication is they're not in any serial order.

886
01:13:59.500 --> 01:13:59.549
It's all right.

887
01:13:59.560 --> 01:13:59.589
I did that.

888
01:14:05.299 --> 01:14:05.399
No,

889
01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:05.520
no,

890
01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:05.680
no,

891
01:14:05.799 --> 01:14:06.279
it's all right.

892
01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:07.970
There's no need just now just now there's no need,

893
01:14:07.979 --> 01:14:08.000
later on,

894
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:08.109
just spontaneously just fine.

895
01:14:15.359 --> 01:14:33.490
Aimo alala quickly.

896
01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:38.359
Where is that massage is over.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:48.700
Come inside,

900
01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:51.029

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:12.700
The boys have to take what the girls have got and give it to the uncles.

1011
01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:16.189
Now you have to get up one by one and give it to the uncle.

1012
01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.649
Now because the system has not been put properly,

1013
01:32:19.859 --> 01:32:22.459
what we can do is to boys must get up,

1014
01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.029

1015
01:32:24.299 --> 01:32:25.569
and give it to the uncle,

1016
01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.620
and uncle then has to give it to the girl.

1017
01:32:28.339 --> 01:32:28.359
mama

1018
01:32:36.419 --> 01:32:37.700

1019
01:32:38.759 --> 01:32:40.040

1020
01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:43.109

1021
01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:45.439
I

1022
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.129
I

1023
01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:48.720
they

1024
01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:56.290
Um,

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:56.680
there was.

1026
01:32:59.180 --> 01:32:59.189
Now,

1027
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:04.160
the mamas be careful.

1028
01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:08.200
Mama,

1029
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.229
mama,

1030
01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:08.259

1031
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:19.120
It has everything in it,

1032
01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:19.759
all right,

1033
01:33:20.009 --> 01:33:21.120
boys and girls,

1034
01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:24.000
everything for the boys and girls.

1035
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.140
Everything in there.

1036
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.549
All right.

1037
01:33:34.589 --> 01:33:35.520
Have you done it?

1038
01:33:35.529 --> 01:33:35.569

1041
01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:40.950
Now,

1042
01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.040
listen now,

1043
01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.120
the second one is more important,

1044
01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.629
it's rather complicated.

1045
01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:51.009
Go faster with the coconuts,

1046
01:33:51.129 --> 01:33:51.560
please.

1047
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:56.640
Does the at this time all the mamas must get up.

1048
01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.970
And give these things in the lap of the girl,

1049
01:34:01.339 --> 01:34:01.970
like this,

1050
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.410
in this thing again,

1051
01:34:03.779 --> 01:34:06.060
all the mamas have to give it to the girl.

1052
01:34:06.919 --> 01:34:07.879
Not for the signal.

1053
01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:08.600
Just a minute,

1054
01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:09.240
just a minute,

1055
01:34:09.319 --> 01:34:09.870
just a minute.

1056
01:34:09.959 --> 01:34:13.120
You just listen to the instructions first and we'll give you the signal for doing it.

1057
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:15.069
Now,

1058
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:18.189
all this has to go to the girl's side on her lap.

1059
01:34:19.259 --> 01:34:20.560
Now the mothers

1060
01:34:20.859 --> 01:34:22.819
have to put it in her lap would be better,

1061
01:34:22.939 --> 01:34:23.930
put it in the lap

1062
01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.419
of the girl.

1063
01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:26.160
All right?

1064
01:34:28.279 --> 01:34:28.870
So

1065
01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.560
now it is given to the girl,

1066
01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.509
whatever it is,

1067
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:34.589

1068
01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.680

01:34:37.279 --> 01:34:37.669
everything

1070
01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:39.250
that represents the

1071
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.750
the wealth or the

1072
01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.439
lakshmi of the family is given to the girl.

1073
01:34:45.729 --> 01:34:47.500
And that is given from the mother's side.

1074
01:34:50.370 --> 01:34:51.580
Because she's the Lakshmi,

1075
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:56.439
and she's going away so symbolically the Lakshmi of the house is given this.

1076
01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:07.660
So uh.

01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:17.259

1080
01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:22.189
no.

1081
01:35:26.259 --> 01:35:30.649
The the boys have to give it in the lap of the girls.

1082
01:35:30.819 --> 01:35:31.209
Now,

1083
01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.569
after doing that,

1084
01:35:32.859 --> 01:35:33.660
the mother

1085
01:35:34.009 --> 01:35:36.890
should show the girl the ornaments that are there

1086
01:35:37.459 --> 01:35:39.700
and make her cover her with the sari.

1087
01:35:40.589 --> 01:35:41.379
And they,

1088
01:35:41.589 --> 01:35:42.209

1089
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:43.640
take out the things.

1090
01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.689
Or even if you do not take out the salis all right,

1091
01:35:47.839 --> 01:35:48.950
but first of all,

1092
01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.549
take out the things that are meant for the boy.

1093
01:35:52.419 --> 01:35:52.919

Ma.

1099
01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.120
Now,

1100
01:36:19.439 --> 01:36:19.879
when,

1101
01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:20.720
when they,

1102
01:36:20.919 --> 01:36:21.879
the ladies,

1103
01:36:21.959 --> 01:36:26.490
the mothers have taken out the things that are for the boys.

1104
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:31.540
These things are to be brought and given to the boys.

1105
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:32.830
That's the first thing.

1106
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:35.990
The girls should keep quiet with these things in their lap.

1107
01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:40.470
Now all the other relations of the girls,

1108
01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.229
whatever ornaments they want to give,

1109
01:36:42.319 --> 01:36:43.359
can give ornaments later,

1110
01:36:43.439 --> 01:36:45.750
but one by one I'll give you instructions.

1111
01:36:45.799 --> 01:36:46.870
Don't do it in a

1112
01:36:47.879 --> 01:36:48.399
hurry.

1113
01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.490
Now first of all,

1114
01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.470
as I said,

1115
01:36:50.799 --> 01:36:51.950
the mamas

1116
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:53.430
have to get up,

1117
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.669
cross over,

1118
01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:57.439
and put it in the lap of the girl.

1119
01:36:57.759 --> 01:36:58.560
Should I do it now?

1120
01:36:59.240 --> 01:36:59.600
OK.

1121
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.160
All the mama do is in the lap of the girl.

1122
01:37:03.589 --> 01:37:05.299
And the girl doesn't do anything.

1123
01:37:05.459 --> 01:37:07.310
She just waits until the,

1124
01:37:07.779 --> 01:37:08.609
until the mother

1125
01:37:08.899 --> 01:37:09.459
shows up.

1126
01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:17.330
Mama representing all the mamas.

1127
01:37:17.410 --> 01:37:20.279
I've also given you Ganesha as present to every boy

1128
01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:23.250
for the boy and the girl,

1129
01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:23.850
both of them.

1130
01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:27.290
We've got 252 are there,

1131
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:30.529
so it's it's all right to give both for the boys,

1132
01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:30.649
all the you sit back at your place.

1133
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.120
So

1134
01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:41.140
that would be

1135
01:37:44.819 --> 01:37:44.959
you come along?

1136
01:37:44.970 --> 01:37:46.049
You bring the supply.

1137
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:47.709
Bring an armful in your laptop.

1138
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:53.310
And all the foreigners must get there also.

1139
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.950
After getting this,

1140
01:37:55.359 --> 01:37:56.470
the function is over,

1141
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.669

01:37:59.439 --> 01:38:00.600
from the western countries,

1143
01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.750
eastern countries should take one G Ganeshai each.

1144
01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:06.419
If you only the western you heard.

1145
01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:09.240
So.

1146
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.069
All the boys and all the girls.

1147
01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:15.229
Remembered the cap's mother,

1148
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:15.330
so may I just pass one to each man.

1149
01:38:15.359 --> 01:38:15.370
No,

1150
01:38:15.379 --> 01:38:15.540
this is not to be just now because this may be spoiled,

1151
01:38:15.549 --> 01:38:15.750

give them later when they have got now.

1153
01:38:41.729 --> 01:38:43.459
The girls,

1154
01:38:44.770 --> 01:38:45.240
the

1155
01:38:45.609 --> 01:38:47.759
boys think whatever are to be given

1156
01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:49.850
for the boys,

1157
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:52.330
whatever you want to give to the boys.

1158
01:38:52.529 --> 01:38:53.359
Now take it out.

1159
01:38:53.419 --> 01:38:55.410
I have a chain to be given to all the boys.

1160
01:38:55.450 --> 01:38:56.799
I've got a chain for them.

1161
01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:04.609

so the mothers should come and tie the chain for the boys.

1165
01:39:13.509 --> 01:39:15.229
So when we give the signal,

So all the mothers ready with the presents for the boy.

01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.049

1183
01:40:59.459 --> 01:41:00.370
I'm giving them

1184
01:41:00.859 --> 01:41:04.609
whatever is to be given to the boys apart from that,

1185
01:41:04.899 --> 01:41:08.169
like someone wants to give the rings and other things

1186
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:09.390
should be.

1187
01:41:10.359 --> 01:41:10.879
Not in.

1188
01:41:11.359 --> 01:41:14.509
Some people have relations have rings and things

1189
01:41:14.839 --> 01:41:17.490
have to be done when I give you a signal.

1190
01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.120
First of all,

1191
01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.500
just tie the chain

1192
01:41:20.279 --> 01:41:22.399
and then whatever our relations are there,

1193
01:41:22.459 --> 01:41:24.270
they want to give something to the boy.

1194
01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:28.799
The relations those who want to give something to the world.

1195
01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:43.220
Sibutala.

1196
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:44.089
What's she say?

1197
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:45.330
I don't know,

1198
01:41:45.359 --> 01:41:47.629
he's got a gift for somebody over there.

1199
01:41:48.839 --> 01:41:49.879
This mama has for that.

1200
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.470
All right.

1201
01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.990
Anybody who has after this,

1202
01:41:53.279 --> 01:41:55.049
there should not be any hurry and scurry.

1203
01:41:55.319 --> 01:41:58.430
Those who have gifts for the girl or for the boy

1204
01:41:58.799 --> 01:42:00.370
should give the relations,

1205
01:42:00.439 --> 01:42:00.919
the friends,

1206
01:42:00.959 --> 01:42:01.669
or anybody,

1207
01:42:01.919 --> 01:42:05.549
but don't hurry up just now one by one because it's quite a mess then.

1208
01:42:05.839 --> 01:42:05.919
See,

1209
01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:08.919
the girls are sitting with all their things and they should not be disturbed.

1210
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.520
They have to keep everything inside the packet is better,

1211
01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.270
the girls,

1212
01:42:13.479 --> 01:42:14.509
so that it is safe.

1213
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:17.580
Put everything inside the packet

1214
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:19.299
if possible.

1215
01:42:19.509 --> 01:42:20.620
All the ornaments,

1216
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.979
everything.

1217
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.979
Let the mother know.

1218
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:25.149
Mothers can help them put everything inside.

1219
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:30.759
karaboga.

1220
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:31.640
Don't put this one.

1221
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.509
Uh,

1222
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:33.680
this you keep outside.

1223
01:42:34.319 --> 01:42:35.379
The thing that is here,

1224
01:42:35.490 --> 01:42:36.299
don't keep it inside,

1225
01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:37.450
it might be spoiled.

1226
01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:39.299
Zala.

1227
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:45.379

1228
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:51.140

Very nice.

1233
01:43:44.379 --> 01:43:44.410
is very good.

1234
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.799
Ah this giving up Ganeshah has brought this silence.

1235
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.439
Uh.

1236
01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:16.669
Ah,

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:16.689

now what did I tell you?

1241
01:44:27.919 --> 01:44:29.120
Do you remember that

1242
01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.720
that the ladies have to move slowly and tie

1243
01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.430
the thing in the neck of their son-in-laws.

1244
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.279
OK,

1245
01:44:37.359 --> 01:44:38.649

01:44:39.759 --> 01:44:44.390
Vattache laches.

Be careful,

1248
01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:47.859
don't drop the pendant or anything.

1249
01:44:48.729 --> 01:44:49.359
Do it

1250
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:52.020

01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:31.910

OK.

1255
01:45:49.959 --> 01:45:50.310
Now,

1256
01:45:50.319 --> 01:45:53.759
whatever the relations or anybody has to give,

1257
01:45:53.799 --> 01:45:54.549
should give

1258
01:45:58.979 --> 01:45:59.009

1259
01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.299
First give to the girls.

1260
01:46:09.959 --> 01:46:10.830
Just a minute.

1261
01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:11.959
One more thing.

1262
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:16.470
Those all the boy ladies who have got the mangalsutra.

1263
01:46:16.939 --> 01:46:16.950
They

1264
01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:20.250
should give it to the boys because they have to tie it up so

1265
01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:22.930
the mothers should take out the magasutras and give it to the boys,

1266
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:25.089
and they must keep it safe with them and you

1267
01:46:25.089 --> 01:46:27.129

1272
01:46:46.899 --> 01:46:48.140
That's after marriage.

1273
01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:48.299
No,

01:46:48.379 --> 01:46:48.660

The other thing is the boys have to be very careful.

Not to forget the mangalsutra this evening because

1282

You should give it to the mama and mama gives to the girl.

01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:57.529
But other direct relations can give it to the girl.

1391
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:06.290
Then they must give it to the mama and the mama should pass it over to the girl.

1404
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:45.549
All right.

1405
01:54:45.850 --> 01:54:46.350
Now,

1406
01:54:46.959 --> 01:54:47.950

1407
01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:54.209

We'll need 4 men.

1412
01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:06.209
On the side where the Indians are,

1413
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:07.259

Take some rest.

1417
01:55:14.569 --> 01:55:15.790
And I think,

1418
01:55:33.439 --> 01:55:33.450

1419
01:55:33.459 --> 01:55:33.470

1420
01:55:33.479 --> 01:55:33.509
not just now,

1421
01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:33.689
I mean after some time because we have to still pass on the ornaments.

1422
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:35.569
Now

1423
01:55:35.939 --> 01:55:36.390
then

1424
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.979
all the girls should take all these things carefully.

1425
01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:41.810
The girl's mothers should go with them and the bride

1426
01:55:42.379 --> 01:55:43.339

1427
01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:44.450

they are important.

1429
01:55:45.899 --> 01:55:47.299
They should go with the girls.

1430
01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:48.850
Keep everything carefully.

1431
01:55:48.979 --> 01:55:50.810
Take some rest after food,

1432
01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:52.259
and then.

1433
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:54.830
You have to

1434
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:57.419
dress up according to the timing

1435
01:55:57.910 --> 01:56:00.770
because all the girls have to be ready by 6

1436
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.700

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.680

1446
01:56:57.209 --> 01:56:58.600

the girls should be brought by the mother.

1450
01:57:11.569 --> 01:57:11.660
You want them to come to where you live?

01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:07.379
All this should be done

01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:08.520

1467
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:09.359

02:04:21.319 --> 02:04:23.390
the mama has to pay for this food.

1566
02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:28.509
Ha.

1567
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:31.049
I'm looking at Mother Day.

1568
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.700
All right.

1569
02:04:33.979 --> 02:04:34.870
So now the,

1570
02:04:35.029 --> 02:04:37.629
the mothers have to give the food to the girls,

1571
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:38.790
make them comfortable,

1572
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:40.459
keep all their things all right.

1573
02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:41.899
And

1574
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.299
the boys

1575
02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:45.629
are to be looked after by mamas.

1576
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:47.229
You should bring the one plate each,

1577
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:48.979
give them food and let them rest.

1578
02:04:49.689 --> 02:04:50.819
And then,

1579
02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:53.779
then afterwards the dressing up has to be done

1580
02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:55.229
by the.

1581
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.580
Um,

1582
02:04:57.279 --> 02:05:00.439
so that accounted the best one by the brothers

1583
02:05:01.049 --> 02:05:01.740
of the boy.

1584
02:05:02.859 --> 02:05:03.439
I know.

1585
02:05:04.799 --> 02:05:05.600
In other words,

1586
02:05:05.779 --> 02:05:08.450
the food is being provided to the couples.

1587
02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:08.750
No,

1588
02:05:08.859 --> 02:05:08.899
no,

1589
02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:09.700
not couples.

1590
02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:12.479
The girls must be looked after by the mothers,

1591
02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:13.529
no confusion,

1592
02:05:13.859 --> 02:05:19.899
and the boys must have their food in their rooms separately by the mamas.

1593
02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:25.850
The mothers feed the girls and the mamas feed the boys in their rooms separately.

1594
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:28.729
And take down the plates and everything

1595
02:05:28.899 --> 02:05:29.770
and let them rest.

1596
02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:31.899
Now the mamas won't meet.

1597
02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:34.790
The boys till they arrive

1598
02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:38.459
at the time on the gate where they will do the RT,

1599
02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:49.359
where they will receive them as bridegrooms.

1600
02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:51.399
So after getting down from the horses,

1601
02:05:51.459 --> 02:05:53.240
they'll be received by the mamas.

1602
02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:55.899
And will be guided down

1603
02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:57.410
to the places

1604
02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:59.600
where they have to stand in a queue.

1605
02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:02.819
So you have to come in the numbers 1234,

1606
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:03.209
like that,

1607
02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:04.209
you have to come

1608
02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.990
and stand in that line and the mamas should provide

1609
02:06:08.299 --> 02:06:09.379
for the garlets.

1610
02:06:11.509 --> 02:06:11.879
So no.

1611
02:06:12.959 --> 02:06:13.540
Go

1612
02:06:19.479 --> 02:06:22.080
solovo numero elle mama.

1613
02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.950
Now the garlands

1614
02:06:27.259 --> 02:06:27.919
will be.

1615
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:31.020
In the hands of the boys and girls

1616
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:32.500
in such a way

1617
02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:37.220
that the flower garland is first and then another garland behind it,

1618
02:06:37.299 --> 02:06:38.629
which is a shining garland.

1619
02:06:40.299 --> 02:06:40.310
uh

1620
02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:47.169
luminos.

1621
02:06:49.569 --> 02:06:49.589
All right.

1622
02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:51.270
And once that happens,

1623
02:06:51.799 --> 02:06:53.279
now the mamas can come and sit down.

1624
02:06:58.689 --> 02:06:59.839
They should stand there.

1625
02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:03.370
With the garlands sit down sit down.

1626
02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:07.069
The

1627
02:07:07.779 --> 02:07:08.140
The

1628
02:07:09.819 --> 02:07:10.580
With the garlands,

1629
02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:13.060
the boys should stand in lines and because there are

1630
02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:15.180
many who are new who have not seen the system,

1631
02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:15.899
that's what I'm saying.

1632
02:07:16.810 --> 02:07:16.830
Doc

1633
02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:25.049
ensuite chakras animerote gas line the clerg lama.

1634
02:07:28.439 --> 02:07:32.109
Now the organisers should know that time the akhaas must be distributed.

1635
02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:43.379
Now one thing is that

1636
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:45.029
after once,

1637
02:07:45.399 --> 02:07:47.009
now you are to be married.

1638
02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:49.370
You'll be tied

1639
02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:51.140
with a thing in your hand,

1640
02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:51.919
all of you,

1641
02:07:53.859 --> 02:07:53.910
the bandage.

1642
02:07:54.669 --> 02:07:56.020
Once that is tied,

1643
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:57.669
you're not to go here and there.

1644
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:59.229
It's now you're going to be married.

1645
02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:00.549
You can't just run here,

1646
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:03.040
then go to the sea or under the tree.

1647
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.700
No.

1648
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:06.180
Keep together.

1649
02:08:06.259 --> 02:08:07.109
It's very difficult,

1650
02:08:07.259 --> 02:08:09.390
easy to locate a 51 people.

1651
02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:11.259
So everything is arranged,

1652
02:08:11.299 --> 02:08:13.620
but you just do one thing not to run about.

1653
02:08:14.459 --> 02:08:15.689
Now you are grown up man.

1654
02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:16.390
You are marrying,

1655
02:08:16.479 --> 02:08:17.339
be responsible.

1656
02:08:27.609 --> 02:08:32.729
All the mothers should die kunda for the boys and the mamas for the.

1657
02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:34.089
Before

1658
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:36.740
They get ready.

1659
02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:39.319
Or after they get rid,

1660
02:08:39.330 --> 02:08:40.049
actually

1661
02:08:40.729 --> 02:08:43.259
somebody responsible should do it before it's done,

1662
02:08:43.299 --> 02:08:43.890
huh.

1663
02:08:44.479 --> 02:08:44.500
All right,

1664
02:09:00.009 --> 02:09:02.350
it would be better when you come here after marriage.

1665
02:09:02.359 --> 02:09:03.020
We'll try that,

1666
02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:05.379
but they'll give you a ja to be put.

1667
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.759
A.

1668
02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:17.109
Then that tying up will be later,

1669
02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:17.169
but once this is put,

1670
02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:17.229
don't run about.
