00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:13.140
It took 2 months the last time to get the stuff out of my

00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:15.619
Married girls,

00:12:15.739 --> 00:12:18.369
girls getting married to go this side,

00:12:20.099 --> 00:12:21.900
girls who are getting married over this side.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.679
Girls are getting married this time

00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:39.520
come on this side.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:40.530
Right.

00:12:53.419 --> 00:12:53.940
and stick into it.

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:00.450
from this side you get the light.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:14.510
you want to stay there.

00:26:34.219 --> 00:26:34.550
Silence please.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.540
All the brides have to go take bath

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:42.250
and take the yellow saris with you.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.079
Change,

00:26:43.339 --> 00:26:46.109
dress up properly and come back when we call.

00:26:47.829 --> 00:26:48.239
All the brides have to go now and have a bath and you will

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:48.459
be given yellow saris and you'll come back when you are to do so.

00:56:31.229 --> 00:56:33.419
The boy should be brought from this side.

00:56:34.399 --> 00:56:34.429
and tell them

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:39.570
that they should find out their brides and sit accordingly.

00:56:41.979 --> 00:56:44.260
They see the brides and sit accordingly here,

00:56:44.469 --> 00:56:47.229
but they come this way to come fast.

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:48.489
They are taking too much time.

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:53.719
How this is only 2 hours.

00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:59.879
Who is in charge of the petrol.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.310
Keep it on the sides.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.909
Whatever things you have,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.919
keep it on the sides.

01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:17.610
Sadikut.

01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:22.689
Playing it

01:07:24.979 --> 01:07:26.419
I'm remembering my husband.

01:07:31.379 --> 01:07:31.899
My time's up.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.409
He's teasing me.

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:37.750
Because my husband is not here,

01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:38.659
so he's teasing me.

01:07:38.739 --> 01:07:39.780
They are playing for you.

01:07:50.959 --> 01:07:51.120
Yeah,

01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:51.350
I'm coming.

01:08:12.879 --> 01:08:13.000
It's clear.

01:08:20.259 --> 01:08:20.270
No.

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.319
I've just burnt the letter,

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:24.490
mother,

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:25.790
and I've just beaten shoes.

01:08:26.009 --> 01:08:27.919
I'm telling Paul Paul's getting involved.

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.479
Tell him not to bother,

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:29.709
Paul,

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:29.919
Paul.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:40.127
Don't get involved.

01:08:40.538 --> 01:08:41.229
You're all right now.

01:08:41.528 --> 01:08:41.969
Just don't worry.

01:08:42.048 --> 01:08:42.528
Leave it to me.

01:08:42.608 --> 01:08:43.127
I'll manage it.

01:08:44.048 --> 01:08:44.167
Yes,

01:08:44.249 --> 01:08:44.769
it's all right.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.259
With

01:08:58.779 --> 01:08:59.740
The indoors up there is.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:02.930
I

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:03.979
OK.

01:09:20.877 --> 01:09:20.929
Oh

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:29.667
I don't know.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.680
It

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:35.649
Must be you because.

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:39.830
That that.

01:09:45.957 --> 01:09:46.828
plan rather than.

01:09:54.439 --> 01:09:54.819
When you go

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:56.979
It's trying to

01:09:58.410 --> 01:09:59.850
What about your healthy?

01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:01.339
All right.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.049
Now you find out the bride.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:08.879
There you go baby.

01:10:11.839 --> 01:10:13.129
Your bridegroom has come.

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:16.299
He's your father,

01:10:16.649 --> 01:10:17.560
but it's all right.

01:10:17.629 --> 01:10:21.569
He has to do it now for he's trying to find out about.

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:27.220
Father will be needed at the time of the wedding.

01:10:30.069 --> 01:10:30.080
He

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:40.240
Come along.

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:42.459
All the boys,

01:10:42.979 --> 01:10:44.569
boys are taking more time.

01:10:48.529 --> 01:10:48.549
I do.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.000
Please come along.

01:10:53.259 --> 01:10:53.600
Alexander now you.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:55.879
I

01:10:59.160 --> 01:10:59.500
Gregor,

01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:03.069
please tell them to find their own wives and sit down.

01:11:09.319 --> 01:11:10.640
I don't even know if they're married to.

01:11:12.629 --> 01:11:14.069
Why have they gone to the sea?

01:11:15.419 --> 01:11:17.580
This madness of sea is also too much,

01:11:19.259 --> 01:11:19.410
huh?

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:23.000
they were

01:11:27.899 --> 01:11:28.330
they were going to the sea.

01:11:32.339 --> 01:11:33.640
But they can't do it here.

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.580
What is the need to go to the sea?

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.279
They should have done it.

01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:39.490
That's not proper.

01:11:39.569 --> 01:11:39.810
You see,

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:41.549
to be arbitrary is not proper.

01:11:48.049 --> 01:11:48.149
Is he a bridegroom?

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:48.240
We've got everybody's here.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.000
You see,

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.109
you should not do any arbitrary behaviour like going to the sea suddenly

01:12:05.839 --> 01:12:07.790
everybody's waiting for this to be done.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.509
The bride rooms,

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:15.979
bride rooms,

01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.029
the sang.

01:12:18.479 --> 01:12:18.899
quit

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.459
the bridegrooms or brides.

01:12:22.479 --> 01:12:26.390
You don't move out because it is going to be difficult for us.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.350
Where is Bernard's wife?

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:33.379
Raise your hand.

01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:36.040
Where is Bernard's wife?

01:12:40.479 --> 01:12:40.680
mama mama.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.589
That's it.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.609
That's.

01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:59.770
What is the need to go to the sea?

01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.160
I.

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:12.290
she's in.

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.580
I think uh if you could put the camera here,

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.450
you could take the photograph of all of them better than

01:13:19.939 --> 01:13:21.580
now we have had enough of mine happen

01:13:26.939 --> 01:13:27.850
any enjoyment.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:29.700
Come inside,

01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.729
come inside.

01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:43.250
He's a finder.

01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:45.950
You

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:49.540
Absolutely.

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:53.979
Yeah.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.490
Now the big complication is they're not in any serial order.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:13:59.549
It's all right.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:13:59.589
I did that.

01:14:05.299 --> 01:14:05.399
No,

01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:05.520
no,

01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:05.680
no,

01:14:05.799 --> 01:14:06.279
it's all right.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:07.970
There's no need just now just now there's no need,

01:14:07.979 --> 01:14:08.000
later on,

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:08.109
just spontaneously just fine.

01:14:15.359 --> 01:14:33.490
Aimo alala quickly.

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:38.359
Where is that massage is over.

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.359

Come inside,

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:49.359
come inside.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:51.029
Oh.

01:15:01.069 --> 01:15:01.080
I.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.609
Where is Mashimona?

01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.910

01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:23.560

Some of the young boys.

01:15:33.799 --> 01:15:34.479
I got to that.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:48.129

01:16:20.259 --> 01:16:21.169

01:23:17.109 --> 01:23:17.189

The boys have to take what the girls have got and give it to the uncles.

01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:16.189
Now you have to get up one by one and give it to the uncle.

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.649
Now because the system has not been put properly,

01:32:19.859 --> 01:32:22.459

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.029

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.620

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.140
Everything in there.

01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.549
All right.

01:33:34.589 --> 01:33:35.520
Have you done it?

01:33:35.529 --> 01:33:35.569

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:40.950
Now,

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.040
listen now,

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.120
the second one is more important,

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.629
it's rather complicated.

01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:51.009
Go faster with the coconuts,

01:33:51.129 --> 01:33:51.560

01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:56.640
Does the at this time all the mamas must get up.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.970
And give these things in the lap of the girl,

01:34:01.339 --> 01:34:01.970
like this,

01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.410
in this thing again,

01:34:03.779 --> 01:34:06.060
all the mamas have to give it to the girl.

01:34:06.919 --> 01:34:07.879
Not for the signal.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:08.600
Just a minute,

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:09.240
just a minute,

01:34:09.319 --> 01:34:09.870
just a minute.

01:34:09.959 --> 01:34:13.120
You just listen to the instructions first and we'll give you the signal for doing it.

01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:15.069
Now,

01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:18.189
all this has to go to the girl's side on her lap.

01:34:19.259 --> 01:34:20.560
Now the mothers

01:34:20.859 --> 01:34:22.819
have to put it in her lap would be better,

01:34:22.939 --> 01:34:23.930
put it in the lap

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.419
of the girl.

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:26.160
All right?

01:34:28.279 --> 01:34:28.870
So

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.560
now it is given to the girl,

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.509
whatever it is,

01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:34.589

lakshmi of the family is given to the girl.

01:34:45.729 --> 01:34:47.500
And that is given from the mother's side.

01:34:50.370 --> 01:34:51.580
Because she's the Lakshmi,

01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:56.439
and she's going away so symbolically the Lakshmi of the house is given this.

01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:07.660

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:22.189

01:35:26.259 --> 01:35:30.649
The the boys have to give it in the lap of the girls.

01:35:30.819 --> 01:35:31.209
Now,

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.569
after doing that,

01:35:32.859 --> 01:35:33.660
the mother

01:35:34.009 --> 01:35:36.890
should show the girl the ornaments that are there

01:35:37.459 --> 01:35:39.700
and make her cover her with the sari.

01:35:40.589 --> 01:35:41.379
And they,

01:35:41.589 --> 01:35:42.209

01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:43.640
take out the things.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.689
Or even if you do not take out the salis all right,

01:35:47.839 --> 01:35:48.950
but first of all,

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.549
take out the things that are meant for the boy.

01:36:20.919 --> 01:36:21.879
the ladies,

01:36:21.959 --> 01:36:26.490
the mothers have taken out the things that are for the boys.

01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:31.540
These things are to be brought and given to the boys.

01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:32.830
That's the first thing.

01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:35.990
The girls should keep quiet with these things in their lap.

01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:40.470
Now all the other relations of the girls,

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.229
whatever ornaments they want to give,

01:36:42.319 --> 01:36:43.359
can give ornaments later,

01:36:43.439 --> 01:36:45.750
but one by one I'll give you instructions.

01:36:45.799 --> 01:36:46.870
Don't do it in a

01:36:47.879 --> 01:36:48.399
hurry.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.490
Now first of all,

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.470
as I said,

01:36:50.799 --> 01:36:51.950
the mamas

01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:53.430

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.669

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:57.439
and put it in the lap of the girl.

01:36:57.759 --> 01:36:58.560
Should I do it now?

01:36:59.240 --> 01:36:59.600
OK.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.160
All the mama do is in the lap of the girl.

01:37:03.589 --> 01:37:05.299
And the girl doesn't do anything.

01:37:05.459 --> 01:37:07.310
She just waits until the,

01:37:07.779 --> 01:37:08.609
until the mother

01:37:08.899 --> 01:37:09.459
shows up.

01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:17.330
Mama representing all the mamas.

01:37:17.410 --> 01:37:20.279
I've also given you Ganesha as present to every boy

01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:23.250

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:23.850
both of them.

01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:27.290
We've got 252 are there,

01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:30.529

01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:30.649

And all the foreigners must get there also.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.950
After getting this,

01:37:55.359 --> 01:37:56.470

whatever you want to give to the boys.

01:38:52.529 --> 01:38:53.359
Now take it out.

01:38:53.419 --> 01:38:55.410
I have a chain to be given to all the boys.

01:38:55.450 --> 01:38:56.799

so the mothers should come and tie the chain for the boys.

01:39:13.509 --> 01:39:15.229

01:41:55.319 --> 01:41:58.430
Those who have gifts for the girl or for the boy

01:41:58.799 --> 01:42:00.370
should give the relations,

01:42:00.439 --> 01:42:00.919
the friends,

01:42:00.959 --> 01:42:01.669
or anybody,

01:42:01.919 --> 01:42:05.549
but don't hurry up just now one by one because it's quite a mess then.

01:42:05.839 --> 01:42:05.919
See,

01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:08.919
the girls are sitting with all their things and they should not be disturbed.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.520
They have to keep everything inside the packet is better,

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.270
the girls,

01:42:13.479 --> 01:42:14.509
so that it is safe.

01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:17.580
Put everything inside the packet

01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:19.299
if possible.

01:42:19.509 --> 01:42:20.620
All the ornaments,

01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.979

01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.979
Let the mother know.

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:25.149
Mothers can help them put everything inside.

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:30.759
karaboga.

01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:31.640
Don't put this one.

01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.509
Uh,

01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:33.680
this you keep outside.

01:42:34.319 --> 01:42:35.379
The thing that is here,

01:42:35.490 --> 01:42:36.299
don't keep it inside,

01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:37.450
it might be spoiled.

01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:39.299
Zala.

01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:45.379
M.

01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:51.140
So this Ganesha also is a present from me.

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:07.709

01:43:44.379 --> 01:43:44.410

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.799
Ah this giving up Ganeshah has brought this silence.

01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.439
Uh.

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:16.669
Ah,

You can when I said that now this is in charge of foreign.

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.229

now what did I tell you?

01:44:27.919 --> 01:44:29.120
Do you remember that

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.720
that the ladies have to move slowly and tie

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.430
the thing in the neck of their son-in-laws.

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.279
OK,

01:44:37.359 --> 01:44:38.649
now all the mothers.

01:44:39.759 --> 01:44:44.390
Vattache laches.

01:44:45.299 --> 01:44:45.950
Be careful,

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:47.859
don't drop the pendant or anything.

01:44:48.729 --> 01:44:49.359
Do it

01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:52.020

01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.319
but.

01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:46.189
OK.

01:45:49.959 --> 01:45:50.310
Now,

01:45:50.319 --> 01:45:53.759
whatever the relations or anybody has to give,

01:45:53.799 --> 01:45:54.549
should give

01:45:58.979 --> 01:45:59.009
on either side.

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.299
First give to the girls.

01:46:09.959 --> 01:46:10.830
Just a minute.

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:11.959
One more thing.

01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:16.470
Those all the boy ladies who have got the mangalsutra.

01:46:16.939 --> 01:46:16.950
They

01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:20.250
should give it to the boys because they have to tie it up so

01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:22.930
the mothers should take out the magasutras and give it to the boys,

01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:25.089
and they must keep it safe with them and you

01:46:25.089 --> 01:46:27.129

we didn't know we had to bring presents so we'll give them later on.

01:46:46.899 --> 01:46:48.140
That's after marriage.

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:48.299
No,

01:46:48.379 --> 01:46:48.660

There will be another opportunity later in the day to give them.

01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.129
The other thing is the boys have to be very careful.

01:47:11.899 --> 01:47:14.979
Not to forget the mangalsutra this evening because

01:47:14.979 --> 01:47:17.129
this is part of the marriage ceremonial.

01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.790

01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:13.459
And those who want to give rings and chains.

01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:16.979
Also should give to the boys.

Now,

01:54:46.959 --> 01:54:47.950

We'll need 4 men.

01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:06.209

I mean after some time because we have to still pass on the ornaments.

01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:35.569
Now

01:55:35.939 --> 01:55:36.390
then

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.979
all the girls should take all these things carefully.

01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:41.810

They should go with the girls.

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:48.850
Keep everything carefully.

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:52.259

01:55:57.910 --> 01:56:00.770

But the girls should not get out

01:56:48.419 --> 01:56:49.729
till the boys are gone.

01:56:57.209 --> 01:56:58.600

the girls should be brought by the mother.

01:57:11.569 --> 01:57:11.660
You want them to come to where you live?

01:57:56.970 --> 01:57:58.640

All these things should be done for ladies in the same way,

01:58:02.009 --> 01:58:02.569
the boys,

01:58:02.609 --> 01:58:04.529
when they get onto their horses,

01:58:04.649 --> 01:58:06.080
they should be tied with this.

01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:07.379
All this should be done

01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:08.520
for that,

01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:09.359
the

02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:42.629
that one is to be given.

02:01:45.490 --> 02:01:46.229
To the girl.

02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:50.350
You have to get up and give it to the girl,

02:01:50.879 --> 02:01:52.950
and then take the girls with you

02:01:53.169 --> 02:01:54.350
out from here.

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:57.250
All the mothers and the

02:01:57.799 --> 02:01:59.479
mamas should take the girl.

02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:03.009
When we give you the signal.

02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.649

02:02:38.939 --> 02:02:41.089
We will give the signal when you have to do it.

02:02:50.279 --> 02:02:50.370
Don't bi or fiance.

02:02:50.455 --> 02:02:51.884
The mothers and the sisters,

02:02:51.964 --> 02:02:53.084
they will escort and make her comfortable

02:02:59.484 --> 02:03:01.754
and keep her ornaments properly somewhere.

02:03:02.004 --> 02:03:02.845
When she gets up,

02:03:02.924 --> 02:03:04.205
she has to wear her sari,

02:03:04.245 --> 02:03:04.725
her blouse,

02:03:04.765 --> 02:03:05.555
and everything.

02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:06.274
Now

02:03:06.645 --> 02:03:08.084
please slowly get up.

02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:10.279
Matt no

02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:14.569
I cross over.

02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:17.009
Should we announce that the couples eat first,

02:03:17.169 --> 02:03:18.160
not that they have to kill?

02:03:21.049 --> 02:03:22.689
For all the here,

02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:27.049
it is clear that you let the couples eat first.

02:03:28.009 --> 02:03:29.529
The couple should not queue,

02:03:29.549 --> 02:03:29.600
just now the couples,

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:29.810
it's a b buffet.

02:03:29.839 --> 02:03:29.879
So first of all,

02:03:29.890 --> 02:03:30.000
the mamas

02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:43.750
of the girl and they should see that they give food

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:46.509
to the girl and to the boy.

02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:55.759
serve them food in the rooms.

02:04:00.479 --> 02:04:00.490
Yes,

02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:03.500
they should come take a plate each

02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:06.779
and take them in the room so they have their food and come back.

02:04:11.370 --> 02:04:18.500
And the mother should give food to the girls.

02:04:19.529 --> 02:04:20.060
Actually,

02:04:20.279 --> 02:04:21.279
in our custom,

02:04:21.319 --> 02:04:23.390
the mama has to pay for this food.

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:28.509
Ha.

02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:31.049
I'm looking at Mother Day.

02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.700
All right.

02:04:33.979 --> 02:04:34.870
So now the,

02:04:35.029 --> 02:04:37.629
the mothers have to give the food to the girls,

02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:38.790
make them comfortable,

02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:40.459
keep all their things all right.

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:41.899
And

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.299
the boys

02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:45.629
are to be looked after by mamas.

02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:47.229
You should bring the one plate each,

02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:48.979
give them food and let them rest.

02:04:49.689 --> 02:04:50.819
And then,

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:53.779
then afterwards the dressing up has to be done

02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:55.229
by the.

02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.580
Um,

02:04:57.279 --> 02:05:00.439
so that accounted the best one by the brothers

02:05:01.049 --> 02:05:01.740
of the boy.

02:05:02.859 --> 02:05:03.439
I know.

02:05:04.799 --> 02:05:05.600
In other words,

02:05:05.779 --> 02:05:08.450
the food is being provided to the couples.

02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:08.750
No,

02:05:08.859 --> 02:05:08.899
no,

02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:09.700
not couples.

02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:12.479
The girls must be looked after by the mothers,

02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:13.529
no confusion,

02:05:13.859 --> 02:05:19.899
and the boys must have their food in their rooms separately by the mamas.

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:25.850
The mothers feed the girls and the mamas feed the boys in their rooms separately.

02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:28.729
And take down the plates and everything

02:05:28.899 --> 02:05:29.770
and let them rest.

02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:31.899
Now the mamas won't meet.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:34.790
The boys till they arrive

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:38.459
at the time on the gate where they will do the RT,

02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:49.359
where they will receive them as bridegrooms.

02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:51.399
So after getting down from the horses,

02:05:51.459 --> 02:05:53.240
they'll be received by the mamas.

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:55.899
And will be guided down

02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:57.410
to the places

02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:59.600
where they have to stand in a queue.

02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:02.819
So you have to come in the numbers 1234,

02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:03.209
like that,

02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:04.209
you have to come

02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.990
and stand in that line and the mamas should provide

02:06:08.299 --> 02:06:09.379
for the garlets.

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.950
Now the garlands

02:06:27.259 --> 02:06:27.919
will be.

02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:31.020
In the hands of the boys and girls

02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:32.500
in such a way

02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:37.220
that the flower garland is first and then another garland behind it,

02:06:37.299 --> 02:06:38.629
which is a shining garland.

02:06:40.299 --> 02:06:40.310
uh

02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:47.169
luminos.

02:06:49.569 --> 02:06:49.589
All right.

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:51.270
And once that happens,

02:06:51.799 --> 02:06:53.279
now the mamas can come and sit down.

02:06:58.689 --> 02:06:59.839
They should stand there.

02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:03.370
With the garlands sit down sit down.

02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:07.069
The

02:07:07.779 --> 02:07:08.140
The

02:07:09.819 --> 02:07:10.580
With the garlands,

02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:13.060
the boys should stand in lines and because there are

02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:15.180
many who are new who have not seen the system,

02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:15.899
that's what I'm saying.

02:07:16.810 --> 02:07:16.830
Doc

02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:25.049
ensuite chakras animerote gas line the clerg lama.

02:07:28.439 --> 02:07:32.109
Now the organisers should know that time the akhaas must be distributed.

02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:43.379
Now one thing is that

02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:45.029
after once,

02:07:45.399 --> 02:07:47.009
now you are to be married.

02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:49.370
You'll be tied

02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:51.140
with a thing in your hand,

02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:51.919
all of you,

02:07:53.859 --> 02:07:53.910
the bandage.

02:07:54.669 --> 02:07:56.020
Once that is tied,

02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:57.669
you're not to go here and there.

02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:59.229
It's now you're going to be married.

02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:00.549
You can't just run here,

02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:03.040
then go to the sea or under the tree.

02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.700
No.

02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:06.180
Keep together.

02:08:06.259 --> 02:08:07.109
It's very difficult,

02:08:07.259 --> 02:08:09.390
easy to locate a 51 people.

02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:11.259
So everything is arranged,

02:08:11.299 --> 02:08:13.620
but you just do one thing not to run about.

02:08:14.459 --> 02:08:15.689
Now you are grown up man.

02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:16.390
You are marrying,

02:08:16.479 --> 02:08:17.339
be responsible.

02:08:27.609 --> 02:08:32.729
All the mothers should die kunda for the boys and the mamas for the.

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:34.089
Before

02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:36.740
They get ready.

02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:39.319
Or after they get rid,

02:08:39.330 --> 02:08:40.049
actually

02:08:40.729 --> 02:08:43.259
somebody responsible should do it before it's done,

02:08:43.299 --> 02:08:43.890
huh.

02:08:44.479 --> 02:08:44.500
All right,

02:09:00.009 --> 02:09:02.350
it would be better when you come here after marriage.
