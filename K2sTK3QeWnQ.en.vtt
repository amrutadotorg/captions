00:17.900 --> 00:24.900
So, thank you very much for the greetings
on this day. It was a Easter Monday when I

01:00.519 --> 01:07.519
got married that day, and also My baptism
took place on Easter Monday. But you know

01:08.510 --> 01:14.820
our Easter Monday always changes according
to the Monday it comes.

01:14.820 --> 01:21.820
So it was quite a big venture for Me to marry.
Actually, I did not need it at all. But as

01:30.210 --> 01:36.730
you know in India, they won't spare any girl
from marriage, and they have been after My

01:36.730 --> 01:43.730
life since I was about eighteen years of age.
So somehow I managed. But I was in the medical

01:43.820 --> 01:50.820
college Lahore, and suddenly the disturbances
broke out there, of a very serious nature.

01:53.030 --> 01:58.790
And I came back, and there was no possibility
of My going back. Then the whole thing -- planned,

01:58.790 --> 02:05.790
I think Divine planned it for My marriage,
because I had to accept them. And as My husband

02:06.840 --> 02:13.840
was there, there were many proposals also,
which they chose this one, and I was married.

02:14.799 --> 02:20.390
In a way arranged, because I had never talked
to him about it, he had not talked to Me,

02:20.390 --> 02:27.390
but he had seen Me once before.
So, for Me it was all right because everybody's

02:30.719 --> 02:37.719
so much worried in My family about My marriage
all the time. But all throughout I feel that

02:41.150 --> 02:46.489
I looked after My husband's relations, family,
though he had none. He had only one sister

02:46.489 --> 02:53.489
whose grandson is Vinay. And all the rest
of the family, all those relations of his,

02:54.739 --> 03:00.849
I really looked after them. And he was counting,
he said, "You have looked after thirty-five

03:00.849 --> 03:07.849
nephews," only nephews and how many nieces
and how many ... Because it was nature, you

03:09.669 --> 03:16.209
see, of compassion, which all they were this
time, worried about all these people.

03:16.209 --> 03:23.209
My mother's family was always well off. They
didn't need any help anywhere. These people

03:23.819 --> 03:30.819
were big landlords, once upon a time, all
My husband's relationship, and suddenly this

03:32.059 --> 03:38.069
was removed, all landlordship was removed
from them, suddenly. And they became absolutely

03:38.069 --> 03:44.329
lost, their children became lost, you see,
because they were used to such luxuries, this,

03:44.329 --> 03:51.329
that, and they had silver, gold, everything.
And as soon as they lost their lands, they

03:56.180 --> 04:02.669
lost, only fifty acres were allowed for every
family. So they had to sell out all their

04:02.669 --> 04:09.669
silvers and everything, and they had to be
really adjusted now to a much poorer strata.

04:11.279 --> 04:18.279
The whole situation came as a very big shock
to all of us, and it was My husband only who

04:21.919 --> 04:26.900
was well placed in life because he had never
bothered about his lands and things. So he

04:26.900 --> 04:31.970
was well placed, he was in the government.
So I took the responsibility of all these

04:31.970 --> 04:38.970
people and tried to help them in their education,
in their finding jobs and things like that.

04:41.669 --> 04:47.150
It's all worked, and they are all very well
off now. So very happy to see them. They all

04:47.150 --> 04:54.150
came for the wedding of My granddaughter,
and also of My daughters, and showed their

04:55.639 --> 05:01.879
gratitude. Out of them very few have come
to Sahaja Yoga. Actually, the relations are

05:01.879 --> 05:08.169
always like that. They are so close that I
tell them there's a black point, you know,

05:08.169 --> 05:12.960
where everything dissolves into zero. So they
are so close that they cannot see what is

05:12.960 --> 05:18.360
Sahaja Yoga. They have tremendous regard for
Me. They have tremendous respect for Me. They'll

05:18.360 --> 05:22.840
do anything, specially My husband has spent
lot of money in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

05:22.840 --> 05:29.720
quite a lot. And doesn't ask for it; or never
mentioned it also. And we have spent so much

05:29.720 --> 05:36.720
of his money because we had a joint account;
he never questioned Me, nothing of the kind.

05:42.870 --> 05:49.870
Very sweet of him. [Suddenly it comes up,
I don't know why. I've been talking too much.]

05:58.270 --> 06:05.270
So the situation is better now. They have
faith in Sahaja Yoga. They try to meditate

06:06.650 --> 06:12.789
also. But they are not seekers, in a way,
because they are so close to Me. As you people

06:12.789 --> 06:19.789
have an advantage, great advantage you have
-- that firstly you are seekers from ages,

06:23.039 --> 06:29.599
and you understand how important it is to
get your Self-realization, because you feel

06:29.599 --> 06:34.939
lost without it. You think that if you don't
get your Self-realization, you should commit

06:34.939 --> 06:40.729
suicide, and there are many letters I have
got saying that "We were mad. We were seeking,

06:40.729 --> 06:46.530
going to this person, going to that person."
Such big, big letters I got from them how

06:46.530 --> 06:50.919
they were cheated, how they were tortured,
and how they were ... spent money and how

06:50.919 --> 06:57.919
they were completely lynched by these gurus.
Some of them had to sell their houses, and

06:59.400 --> 07:06.400
children were removed from schools, and everybody
became extremely poor. So this was in London

07:07.689 --> 07:14.080
much worse. Later on I found that every country
has this problem, they became drug addicts

07:14.080 --> 07:21.080
and all that.
Despite all that now we have so many people

07:21.710 --> 07:27.740
who are Sahaja yogis all over the world, not
only in Australia. But Australia has quite

07:27.740 --> 07:34.740
a lot of Sahaja yogis, I must say. And quantity
is very, very large and good, and people are

07:36.030 --> 07:43.030
nice, but we have had, as I told you, a very
bumpy start. Because of that, certain conditionings

07:43.979 --> 07:50.979
are built up in people. But now we have to
see that our quality has to improve. Quality

07:53.280 --> 08:00.280
has to improve, and the test of quality, I
think, is that they are very anxious to do

08:04.419 --> 08:10.199
whatever is possible for Sahaja Yoga. Whenever
it's possible, whatever is possible, they

08:10.199 --> 08:17.199
are anxious to do it. And also, they run a
very good family, children, household. This

08:22.099 --> 08:29.099
is the sign that you have really developed
in Sahaja Yoga. But if that is not so, then

08:29.120 --> 08:35.740
you will never enjoy the progress Sahaja Yoga
is making.

08:35.740 --> 08:40.909
I have seen people, one person can give realization
to one thousand. But there's one person who

08:40.909 --> 08:45.040
has been in Sahaja Yoga, say, about twenty
years, has not given realization to even one

08:45.040 --> 08:52.040
person. So we have two types, two extremes,
I should -- two extremes, from one to another.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.760
Now some people believe that they are very
old Sahaja yogis. This is another mistake

08:57.760 --> 09:02.090
we commit. They believe, "We are the senior."
There's nothing like seniority, juniority

09:02.090 --> 09:08.850
in Sahaja Yoga. I find sometimes very new
people are such great Sahaja yogis. Very new.

09:08.850 --> 09:15.850
They just go down, absolutely, into the essence
of themselves and of Sahaja Yoga. Maybe their

09:19.120 --> 09:26.120
previous lives must have been so great, possibly,
or maybe this life they have achieved something

09:26.920 --> 09:33.920
great maybe from the parents or from somebody.
But some of them are really very, very deep.

09:40.060 --> 09:46.890
One of the things I have seen in, mostly in
Sahaja Yoga, that they are more concerned

09:46.890 --> 09:53.890
about themselves, about their families, about
their children, at the most. But look at Me,

09:55.810 --> 10:01.200
I'm not ... I never bother about My health.
If anybody asks Me, "How are You?" I said,

10:01.200 --> 10:07.970
"I am first class." I never bother about Myself
for anything, for My comfort, or for anything,

10:07.970 --> 10:14.970
food, anything. I have no sense at all to
divert My attention inward. But if somebody

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
else, say, is in trouble or has something,
I just, just feel I must help that person.

10:25.630 --> 10:31.820
I must do something about him, I'm very concerned.
Sometimes also, My family people said that

10:31.820 --> 10:37.070
"Even if You have one thousand concerns that
You have for others, You'll be better off."

10:37.070 --> 10:44.070
But that's why nothing, nothing can harm Me
because I am always worried about your progress,

10:47.700 --> 10:54.700
about your problems, about your quarrels and
fights, and this and that. It's such a tremendous

10:59.630 --> 11:06.630
concern it is, such a full-throated, you can
say -- absolutely all My attention just goes

11:10.680 --> 11:15.760
focused on these problems.
As soon as I see person, I know what the problem

11:15.760 --> 11:22.760
the person has, why is he not progressing,
what is the problem he has with others. Everything

11:24.620 --> 11:31.620
I know in no time. But even if I know, I need
not bother; but I really get very much bothered

11:34.870 --> 11:41.620
about them, as if -- they are, as it is you
know, part and parcel of My body -- but the

11:41.620 --> 11:48.620
amount I worry about them, sometimes. People
have always remarked about Me sometimes that

11:52.500 --> 11:57.720
"Mother, You need not worry so much about
them. Why are You worried? Let them go to

11:57.720 --> 12:04.720
hell. Let them." If you have once called Me
"Mother," then I really forgive. I've forgiven

12:04.990 --> 12:10.630
all the people who have troubled Me and have
insulted Me, and given trouble in Sahaja Yoga.

12:10.630 --> 12:17.630
I've forgiven all of them. I have no time
to worry about not forgiving.

12:19.080 --> 12:26.080
I should be an example for you, for you to
understand that the more attention we pay

12:27.660 --> 12:34.660
to others, not finding their faults or criticizing
them, but doing things for others; small,

12:35.050 --> 12:42.050
small nice things if you start doing for others,
immediately, you will be surprised, your attention

12:42.380 --> 12:49.380
will sharpen. It will have a very great effect.
Sahaja Yoga will spread through you and you

12:50.400 --> 12:57.400
will, yourself, will be very different person.
You won't criticize other Sahaja yogis, you

12:58.180 --> 13:02.490
won't criticize this, that. I mean fundamental
things, if there's something wrong, you have

13:02.490 --> 13:09.490
to tell Me. That's different. But that seldom
people tell Me. So first we must extend our

13:12.450 --> 13:19.450
attention outside, towards others, not towards
ourselves. Then the same about our children,

13:20.520 --> 13:25.050
our house, our this, that. Just extend your
attention outside.

13:25.050 --> 13:32.050
Now see, I am a housewife. The last twenty-four
years I have been traveling. And in a way

13:35.450 --> 13:42.430
you can say I am neglecting My family. But
if you ask My family people, they'll say -- today

13:42.430 --> 13:49.430
they telephoned to Me to thank Me that I have
completely built up this family. I don't know

13:50.060 --> 13:57.060
when did I give time to them, but they feel
that way, very much. And everybody thanked

13:58.080 --> 14:04.650
Me, every one of them said, "This family has
been built up only by You, without You nothing

14:04.650 --> 14:11.650
could have been possible." Because of My attention
outside is so easy to work out anything that

14:15.040 --> 14:19.850
is needed to be done. Whatever needed to be
done is done.

14:19.850 --> 14:26.850
I'll give an example. You may call it a miracle.
My grandson wanted to go to a university,

14:28.820 --> 14:35.820
good university in America. But they said,
"You have to appear for SAT, and after that

14:36.020 --> 14:41.720
only we'll admit," and he would lose one year
for that. I didn't want him to go to America

14:41.720 --> 14:48.460
before doing SAT, because I thought that,
see for six, seven days he goes there, he

14:48.460 --> 14:55.460
won't be able to do much. And we left it at
that. All right, he was preparing for SAT.

14:57.180 --> 15:02.890
I had told one Sahaja yogi there, Paul, that
"You see if you can help us." But nobody would

15:02.890 --> 15:06.080
talk to him in the university, when he went
there, they wouldn't even say if they have

15:06.080 --> 15:13.080
received the form of My grandson.
The other day they rang up to say that he's

15:13.810 --> 15:20.810
got admission already. How? God knows. The
information has come that he's got admission.

15:22.080 --> 15:29.080
Nobody in America can be admitted without
SAT exams. Without any condition he got admission,

15:31.890 --> 15:37.580
and they told Me.
I said, "Maybe Paul must have done something."

15:37.580 --> 15:42.770
So I telephoned to Paul. He said, "Mother
I did not go to that university. I didn't

15:42.770 --> 15:49.350
ask anybody, they wouldn't talk to me. They
said you better not ring here, get lost."

15:49.350 --> 15:56.350
And somehow, they don't know how, they admitted
him. And he was a last minute person who sent

15:59.790 --> 16:03.620
the form to this.
But only thing, one thing had happened, he

16:03.620 --> 16:10.360
told Me that "If I don't get admission in
a good university, I will not go to America.

16:10.360 --> 16:17.360
It's too much waste of money." Very wise boy.
I said, "All right." That's the only time

16:17.690 --> 16:24.690
I gave bandhan. And see now, he's got his
admission. His elder sister also got admission

16:26.680 --> 16:32.700
in John Hopkins Institute without any condition.
Though when she went there, she found the

16:32.700 --> 16:36.590
atmosphere was no good for her, she ran away.
But on the whole, that unconditional, they

16:36.590 --> 16:40.160
are saying, Gregoire told Me, "Mother, not
possible. How can she get it?"

16:40.160 --> 16:47.160
I said, "There's a letter." Without putting
any pressure, without doing anything, it happens.

16:49.540 --> 16:56.540
It's a miracle. I must say it's a miracle.
But something works, and that is this all-pervading

16:59.260 --> 17:06.260
power.
With one idea if you go about, it will not

17:09.689 --> 17:15.650
help you. If you want ... Someone said, "Mother,
we wanted to get this house, we couldn't get

17:15.650 --> 17:22.280
it." Because you had only one idea, to get
the house. But if you had the whole idea that

17:22.280 --> 17:29.280
if we get the house, then we'll do these things,
we can work it out better, this, that, then

17:29.870 --> 17:36.870
you get it. So, you should project yourself
towards other things which are more important

17:41.090 --> 17:48.090
than yourself. Then suddenly you will start
growing. It's like some trees grow higher,

17:49.310 --> 17:56.310
some do not. Why? Because they aspire the
sun's light and they want to be more nearer

17:59.360 --> 18:06.240
to sun. But that's not possible, you cannot
be nearer the sun by just growing few feet.

18:06.240 --> 18:13.240
But they aspire. So they are taller than others.
In the same group, you'll find, some trees

18:13.610 --> 18:20.610
grow taller, some don't.
So, one aspect is that you have to meditate,

18:27.540 --> 18:34.540
no doubt. So, one thing is to develop quality
you have to meditate. That I said. But you

18:43.050 --> 18:49.800
must know what is your problem. You are right-sided
or left-sided. It's very important to know

18:49.800 --> 18:56.100
whether you are right-sided or left-sided.
Now some people have problems which are left-sided.

18:56.100 --> 19:03.100
All right, they start doing water treatment.
There was doctor in Delhi, Dr. Nigam, you

19:16.350 --> 19:23.350
must be knowing him. He had, I had cured his
paralysis. I was surprised that his left hand

19:24.020 --> 19:30.450
was still not working out properly.
So I asked him, "What sort of a meditation

19:30.450 --> 19:36.420
you do?"
He said, "With the light and with the water."

19:36.420 --> 19:41.510
I said, "What? You are doing both?"
"Yes."

19:41.510 --> 19:48.510
I said, "What, what's wrong with you is right
side [Shri Mataji corrects] -- left side.

19:48.670 --> 19:54.850
So you should just do candle treatment. Just
drop it." I said it to him. Just when I said

19:54.850 --> 20:01.540
it to him, his hand started opening out. I
said it only; becomes like a mantra I think.

20:01.540 --> 20:06.770
Started opening, he has opened his hand.
So about treatment also you must understand

20:06.770 --> 20:13.270
what treatment you must take. Now some people
are left-sided. They should take left side

20:13.270 --> 20:19.730
treatment only. There should be no confusion.
So I said, "Who told you this?"

20:19.730 --> 20:24.420
He said, "Everybody said the same thing."
I said, "What did they say?"

20:24.420 --> 20:31.410
"That you can take this."
In Sahaja Yoga there are certain rules and

20:31.410 --> 20:36.150
regulations of the Divine. So now if you are
suffering from the left, you just take treatment

20:36.150 --> 20:43.150
for left. No water treatment, at all. Now
you are suffering from the right, then don't

20:43.210 --> 20:49.559
take the candle treatment at all, at all.
These are two sides which are to be corrected,

20:49.559 --> 20:54.780
then you are in the center.
When you feel you are in center, you can use

20:54.780 --> 21:01.780
both the things. But that is normally very
few, I've seen. Normally you find very few

21:02.910 --> 21:09.910
people who have this central point. If they
have, they should do this treatment. But there

21:10.380 --> 21:15.340
is no need to do treatment once you are in
the center. But you have to meditate. So you

21:15.340 --> 21:20.950
can sit before the photograph. But to take
out all your conditionings and things, or

21:20.950 --> 21:27.950
may be the day's problem, you can sit before
the photograph with a candle as well as water.

21:28.490 --> 21:35.490
But the ones who are not, should not. And
one should not feel also bad if the leaders

21:37.410 --> 21:44.410
tell them, "You are left-sided or right-sided."
The problem is that in Sahaja Yoga there are

21:45.360 --> 21:52.360
leaders. It's a myth. It's a myth. It's not
something so seriously to be taken. But these

21:53.710 --> 22:00.710
leaders are there because I cannot communicate
with all of you. So, they are there. When

22:01.940 --> 22:08.940
it came to talk about the leaders, nobody
told Me anything. Very surprising. Never they

22:10.420 --> 22:17.420
told Me the leaders are doing like this. I
had to discover it every time I came here.

22:18.180 --> 22:23.570
You should have written to Me earlier that
our leader is like this or it's happening

22:23.570 --> 22:30.570
here. There's no harm in writing that. But
they did not, none of them. Till I came here,

22:31.930 --> 22:35.710
I discovered the kind of people they were.
Actually, they dis ... I discovered them only

22:35.710 --> 22:41.760
in Europe. I did not know that they were doing
all these things.

22:41.760 --> 22:48.760
Then they were developing also some funds
and raising some sort of a money, nobody told

22:50.160 --> 22:57.160
Me. Even when they came to India they collected
money. But nobody told Me that they were collecting

22:57.580 --> 23:03.180
money for this or that. I mean, at least you
should have told Me. Somebody should have

23:03.180 --> 23:10.180
told Me. That's how they became sort of absolutely
fascists. They thought, "We are the lords,

23:11.290 --> 23:17.120
we can do whatever we like." But for other
nonsensical things they'll write such letters,

23:17.120 --> 23:20.360
but never about something which is very, very
good, essential and needed. And anybody who

23:20.360 --> 23:20.820
writes Me like that, I'm very much thankful
to that person. Not just to criticize but

23:20.820 --> 23:21.880
to give exact trouble, or exact problem that
is facing. I'll be very happy if you people

23:21.880 --> 23:23.240
write to Me truthfully, not what is troubling
you, but what is troubling everyone. So I

23:23.240 --> 23:30.240
can solve the problem much better, isn't it?
Now the another thing we had to tell about,

23:31.690 --> 23:38.690
that what should be the relationships of husband
and wife. Now I've already had many occasions

23:42.100 --> 23:49.100
to talk to them. Now you are married by Me.
It was not such an arranged ma ... arranged

23:50.550 --> 23:56.120
marriage, you were given time to find out
till the end. And even if you did not like

23:56.120 --> 24:01.679
the person, you could have told Me and we
would have finished the marriage. But even

24:01.679 --> 24:08.679
when it is registered, you've stayed with
the lady for so many years, or with the man

24:08.750 --> 24:14.130
for so many years, you have had children and
after that suddenly you come up that "Mother

24:14.130 --> 24:21.130
we cannot cope." But this is going too far
with yourself and with the whole society of

24:23.380 --> 24:28.800
Sahaja Yoga. If you don't like somebody, if
there's a problem you should find out in the

24:28.800 --> 24:35.800
beginning. I'll be the last person to force
you to marry anyone. Even if you are married,

24:36.320 --> 24:43.059
and just after say three, four months you
let Me know, the marriage can be broken. And

24:43.059 --> 24:50.059
I have told Yogi now not to register them
for about three months and see for yourself.

24:50.370 --> 24:57.040
Now you must understand that marriage is not
an institution well-practiced in the West.

24:57.040 --> 25:03.900
Till they are married, they are happy. As
soon as they are married there's something

25:03.900 --> 25:09.790
goes wrong in their heads. Maybe the reason
is there's a legal bondage in the marriage.

25:09.790 --> 25:14.530
If you are married to somebody, you see, your
money will be shared or anything, that kind

25:14.530 --> 25:21.530
of a fear is there. For the same reason I
have asked so many times that you don't get

25:22.880 --> 25:29.880
married to somebody till you are normal. But
many people who are sick, have diseases, have

25:33.160 --> 25:40.160
problems, have some sort of funny ideas, just
they marry, as the Americans say, for the

25:43.420 --> 25:50.420
heck of it. And then it's such a troublesome
thing for Me. Firstly I get concerned, secondly

25:55.460 --> 26:02.460
it's a very bad example for other Sahaja yogis,
and brings a bad name for all of us.

26:05.280 --> 26:12.040
It's not difficult to enjoy your marriage
because mostly we really examine and find

26:12.040 --> 26:19.040
out properly what's the matter with what,
and who is capable of carrying on with whom.

26:21.970 --> 26:28.970
We, we try our level best, but there are sometimes
four hundred, five hundred applications of

26:31.540 --> 26:38.540
various types. Sometimes you do miss, do miss
certain points. But you people can understand

26:42.910 --> 26:49.910
that, sometimes, and you should try to help
Me by understanding that what is it after

26:55.960 --> 27:02.960
all? What is so important?
There was a Sahaja yogi, very good Sahaja

27:04.130 --> 27:10.070
yogi from England. He had a wife who was really
beautiful wife, very well educated, this,

27:10.070 --> 27:15.820
that, very smart. He came to Me, he said,
"Mother I want absolutely to divorce this

27:15.820 --> 27:19.380
woman."
I said, "Why? She is so good looking."

27:19.380 --> 27:26.380
He said, "No I don't want. I want to divorce."
He was after Me. Then I talked to her. She

27:26.890 --> 27:30.670
said, "I also want to divorce."
"All right, divorce. Divorce is allowed in

27:30.670 --> 27:37.670
Sahaja Yoga." So they divorced each other.
Then, we were showing him different photographs

27:38.670 --> 27:44.650
and things that "Now tell Me, which one would
you like to marry?" So he chose a girl who

27:44.650 --> 27:51.650
is not well educated, who is not by any means
good looking. She is very dark with very thick

27:54.470 --> 28:01.470
lips and all that. But I love her very much.
I like her very much. She is very lovable

28:01.970 --> 28:08.790
person, extremely sweet. So, he chose her.
I was surprised.

28:08.790 --> 28:13.059
I said, "What?"
"Yes Mother. See her vibrations."

28:13.059 --> 28:20.059
Still I said, "You see her first."
So when we went to Ganapatipule, "Yes," he

28:20.100 --> 28:25.980
said. "This is the one I want to marry." I
was surprised, you see, with all that how

28:25.980 --> 28:32.600
could he say that "I want to marry this girl"?
I said, "Be sure."

28:32.600 --> 28:39.600
"Yes, yes, I'm very sure, I want to marry."
What he told Me that "She's tranquility personified.

28:41.049 --> 28:48.049
I feel so tranquil." She is full of vibrations,
like bag of vibrations. I know that. But I

28:50.520 --> 28:55.390
didn't know how this fellow has felt it. He
has just fallen in love with her, I tell you.

28:55.390 --> 29:01.890
And he says, "She is the most beautiful person
I have met." He doesn't see anything else

29:01.890 --> 29:08.890
that is outside. Later on My own sister said,
"What have You done? What a match!"

29:09.850 --> 29:16.850
So I looked at that girl, and then I started
seeing these points that she's not good looking,

29:17.200 --> 29:24.200
she's not this, but what he said -- she's
tranquility. She is just tranquility. He went

29:24.450 --> 29:31.170
to her village all the way, and he met all
his family and everybody was surprised, such

29:31.170 --> 29:38.170
a handsome looking Englishman of all the things.
And she said [Shri Mataji corrects] he said,

29:39.320 --> 29:46.320
"Mother, she has neutralized all my nonsensical
points. She's so beautiful." And he's really

29:47.580 --> 29:54.580
in love with her.
So that is a sign of a very deep Sahaja yogi

29:54.670 --> 30:01.670
that they don't go after superficial things.
She cooks South Indian food, he loves it.

30:02.900 --> 30:09.900
Whatever she does he loves. He cares for her
very much. And she is neither left-sided,

30:12.520 --> 30:19.520
nor right-sided, she is in the center. So
both of them match each other because spiritually

30:19.950 --> 30:26.950
they are on the same level, very deep, and
that is what we have to be. If we are not

30:29.980 --> 30:36.980
spiritually matched, then the problem comes
in. We have to have proper matching of vibrations.

30:39.770 --> 30:44.120
Of course, we see to it when we marry, I mean
can you imagine, ninety-nine percent marriages

30:44.120 --> 30:51.120
have been successful. And some of the marriages
were mischievously done I know, there were

30:51.140 --> 30:58.140
some mischiefs. But still they have worked
out. Still they are happy people. But some

31:04.500 --> 31:11.500
people are bent upon making their marriage
a problem. Some of them, extremely egoistical,

31:11.620 --> 31:18.620
think no end of themselves, and start making
everybody miserable. What makes them so much

31:21.580 --> 31:28.580
full of ego, I don't know. And they just spoil
their marriages. They become unhappy themselves,

31:30.950 --> 31:37.950
and they make others also unhappy. Now My
husband has never been a Sahaja yogi, never.

31:40.880 --> 31:47.880
Even now, I wouldn't say he is a Sahaja yogi.
Even now. I don't know. But I knew how to

31:48.740 --> 31:55.740
handle him and how to work it out. And I've
managed very well, and he also knows. Always

31:57.919 --> 32:04.919
he says, "You are very moral person; You are
a very noble person." All those things he

32:08.230 --> 32:15.230
says to Me. And all, you see, his saying is
like this that "You are, but You cannot make

32:18.690 --> 32:20.840
others."
I said, "I can, why not?"

32:20.840 --> 32:27.840
First he could not believe that I could transform
people. And now he knows I have transformed.

32:28.419 --> 32:35.419
He said, "They have become angels." And so
that you are now angels.

32:36.330 --> 32:43.330
I am not very happy with the crèche you have
here, not at all. It's a mess. And I don't

32:45.179 --> 32:52.179
know but it's a -- the children coming out
of this school are racist. Very racial ideas

32:53.090 --> 33:00.090
they have, that's the report Yogi gave Me.
Not about Rome. It is so. So I would say we

33:03.370 --> 33:09.190
should teach, change the teachers, is the
best way. And the children are very aggressive

33:09.190 --> 33:16.190
when they come, very harsh. I would say, put
some Indian teachers there instead of some

33:16.240 --> 33:21.690
Western teachers. Maybe they are racist or
maybe something wrong there. This is the report

33:21.690 --> 33:28.320
I have got about your children, Australian
children create more problems, and it's very

33:28.320 --> 33:35.320
difficult, and they are racist. But there
are hardly any Indian children there, you

33:35.450 --> 33:42.450
see. But if there's one even, they aggress.
There are, I think, only three children who

33:43.470 --> 33:50.470
I think are Indians only, or one may be a
Negro, I don't know. But all these children

33:51.730 --> 33:58.260
just jump on them when they go from here.
Takes time to change their ideas.

33:58.260 --> 34:03.120
If you are racist you cannot be in Sahaja
Yoga, you understand that. We don't believe

34:03.120 --> 34:07.880
in race and religion and all these things
which are separating human beings from one

34:07.880 --> 34:14.880
to another. That is our ideal, that we cannot
have this kind of a nonsense in our society.

34:18.869 --> 34:25.730
And be careful. Watch your children, how they
react to black people. Specially for Australian

34:25.730 --> 34:32.659
children it is being pointed out. So I think
there's something wrong with some people here.

34:32.659 --> 34:39.659
They should just try to find out if we are
by any chance trying to teach them that white

34:40.989 --> 34:47.989
skin is better than the black.
As I told you in the lecture, I hope you have

34:48.549 --> 34:55.549
listened to what I said about the genes. That
it is now found out that two protective genes

34:56.789 --> 35:03.789
that Asians have the white skin don't have
at all. One of them is the right side, another

35:05.930 --> 35:12.930
the left side. So a white skin will take to
a violence much more easily than an Asian.

35:15.839 --> 35:22.839
Asian actually means now Indians and Chinese.
Culturally they are the same. Now that means,

35:25.479 --> 35:31.690
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, your genes have
been transformed, and you have protective

35:31.690 --> 35:38.690
genes within you. And one of them is, as I
told you, is the right-sided, hate people

35:40.999 --> 35:46.900
and kill people, be violent, this racialism,
which is now coming back again because they

35:46.900 --> 35:53.900
will take to it easily because there's no
protection against it. Now you can see in

35:53.910 --> 36:00.910
My own family, we had eleven children. Some
were fair, very fair; some were dark. We never

36:02.069 --> 36:08.920
knew what is racialism is because the skin
is so, I mean, is skin deep as they say.

36:08.920 --> 36:15.920
So, you see, the ...you are now confronted,
you must understand that, with these two horrible

36:16.930 --> 36:22.049
genes, by which, one that will take you to
violence, take you to temper, will take you

36:22.049 --> 36:29.049
to this kind of racialism and hatred and fundamentalism
and the another one is indulgences, laziness

36:31.819 --> 36:38.819
or serious things like sex and this and that,
and all these habits you develop of drugs.

36:41.920 --> 36:48.920
So you have to be very careful now. By just
announcing that, Germans announced that "We

36:50.779 --> 36:56.319
are a white race," you see, "we are higher
than anyone." How are they higher? Just imagine.

36:56.319 --> 37:03.319
They killed little, little children, small
little children into a gas chamber and saw

37:03.799 --> 37:09.329
them being burnt. Can you imagine anybody
who is a evolved soul, or who is a higher

37:09.329 --> 37:16.329
race, will do such a nasty thing like that?
But this is ... they have sort of self-proportioned

37:21.900 --> 37:28.900
values and virtues, which they don't have.
They were so horrible that they took the fat

37:34.430 --> 37:41.430
from the dead bodies in Poland, Warsaw, and
they had bath with it. Like a soap, they used.

37:47.599 --> 37:54.599
So grotesque. Whole thing is so horrifying.
And they think they are very, very great races.

37:55.269 --> 38:00.619
Even Max Muller wrote like that, you see.
He said it's the Germans who came to India

38:00.619 --> 38:07.619
and wrote Vedas. Their forefathers cannot
write Vedas.

38:09.019 --> 38:14.900
So now try to understand that what we are
facing basically. What I feel, in the arrogance

38:14.900 --> 38:21.900
of this white skin, these people crossed over
their limitations, their maryadas -- the forefathers.

38:24.650 --> 38:31.650
Like the way the Spanish went to America.
You can't find one aboriginal person there,

38:33.349 --> 38:40.349
not one. I wanted to see in Chile, in Argentina,
in Brazil, not even one. Where are they lost?

38:41.170 --> 38:48.170
They all went to the hills and some of them
are preserved in Bolivia and all that. And

38:50.190 --> 38:57.190
the revenge has started. From Bolivia all
these horrible drugs are coming. And the whole

38:59.630 --> 39:06.630
of America is just crushed with that. There's
no wisdom, just to think you have fair skin.

39:11.329 --> 39:18.150
All right, go ahead. Where are you going?
You see these. What about the Americans? Where

39:18.150 --> 39:25.150
are they going? Now they are concerned, little
bit. But sixty-five percent people may get

39:26.430 --> 39:33.430
schizophrenia in that country. Now how can
you be satisfied with yourself when you see

39:34.049 --> 39:39.479
all these things happening, because you have
just a white skin?

39:39.479 --> 39:46.479
So first thing you must try to understand
that even if there's a trace of racialism

39:49.759 --> 39:56.759
in you, better throw it away. On the contrary,
I think this country has really, real justice

40:00.140 --> 40:06.970
for racists. Justice-wise you must say Australians
know to be really a multicultural society,

40:06.970 --> 40:13.970
and they understand the value of it: what
you have gained through multicultural societies.

40:18.599 --> 40:25.359
There's so many things to be learned, that
they are very clean, outside, not in personal

40:25.359 --> 40:30.739
life. They'll keep the house very clean, the
carpets very clean, everything very clean,

40:30.739 --> 40:36.170
but as far as themselves are concerned, they
are not so clean. Of course, now with Sahaja

40:36.170 --> 40:41.460
Yoga you are changed, I am not saying.
But I know of English people, they would not

40:41.460 --> 40:48.460
take bath for months, months, they used to
smell like hell. And when My husband was there

40:49.410 --> 40:55.400
we used to shake hands, and the hands would
smell for days together. We used to put scent,

40:55.400 --> 41:01.719
attar, this, that, but still. Using paper,
paper, it's all right because it is very cold,

41:01.719 --> 41:08.719
but it's not that cold. We have lived in England
for so many years. We always use water and

41:10.529 --> 41:17.529
running water. In the same tub, three, four
people take bath, to save pounds. The only

41:17.700 --> 41:24.700
mantra they know is "save pounds". Same here,
people are extremely money-oriented when they

41:26.109 --> 41:33.109
have so much money compared to others. So,
for Sahaja yogis, is important that you should

41:38.180 --> 41:45.180
be frugal and you should not be miserly. You
need not. But you should be clean inside.

41:46.880 --> 41:52.670
That's very important, not outside so much
because see all these diseases are coming,

41:52.670 --> 41:56.589
these things are coming, one has to be very
careful.

41:56.589 --> 42:02.059
Secondly, you are so protective of yourself,
I mean you are always thinking about yourself.

42:02.059 --> 42:08.749
Extremely protective. So you do not develop
any immunity to anything. If you have to travel

42:08.749 --> 42:13.269
like Me, you would get sick within one month's
time. Firstly you can't eat anything, you

42:13.269 --> 42:19.869
get hepatitis. If you smell something you
get hay fever. You do that, I mean all these

42:19.869 --> 42:26.430
things are coming because of over-protectiveness.
You must make your children to play in sand;

42:26.430 --> 42:33.430
you must make them go about. No -- so protective
of your children! So when they grow they cannot

42:34.380 --> 42:41.380
stand anything which is absolutely not completely,
we can say, covered. But Indians don't get

42:47.249 --> 42:54.249
it. We are full of parasites, full of mosquitoes,
full of this. Australian children, when they

42:54.259 --> 43:01.259
got bitten by mosquitoes, they got malaria.
But the whole city was there, nobody got malaria.

43:01.900 --> 43:07.880
Not one person. Now they were surprised, how
is it these boys and girls have got malaria?

43:07.880 --> 43:14.880
So in childhood, we should not make our children
sort of all the time extremely delicate. You

43:16.829 --> 43:23.829
look all right. I mean, might have good muscles
to look at. But you are very, very vulnerable

43:26.940 --> 43:33.249
to any disease. You can see from your children.
I'm not saying about Australians. All the

43:33.249 --> 43:40.249
people from the West, whether they are Americans
or they are Europeans or they are this. But

43:41.339 --> 43:48.339
I've seen Russia, people are very, very good.
They don't catch much. They don't suffer from

43:49.359 --> 43:55.940
all this.
So this over-protectiveness, and also there

43:55.940 --> 44:01.160
are books and books. Today they'll write a
book about children, "You must give them feed

44:01.160 --> 44:07.269
at the right time." Then they will write next
time, "No, no you should not do that way.

44:07.269 --> 44:13.960
You should allow them to eat whatever they
like." Then thirdly they'll say that "You

44:13.960 --> 44:17.170
should not give this to your children, that
you should not give, that should not happen."

44:17.170 --> 44:24.170
With all this knowledge, people are not aware
that they are making their children like the

44:28.019 --> 44:34.920
dolls in the hands of these writers. Whatever
they say, whatever they do, there's no sense

44:34.920 --> 44:41.549
in it. We know what is needed for the children
in Sahaja Yoga. Actually these are people

44:41.549 --> 44:45.200
just selling their books, you know, whatever
knowledge they have, they have a flair to

44:45.200 --> 44:52.200
write, they write it and you accept it and
you get into problems. And this is a very,

44:52.499 --> 44:59.489
very common thing. They protect the children
too much which they need not. But whenever

44:59.489 --> 45:06.489
it is necessary one should.
My main thing is that before the children

45:07.420 --> 45:14.420
how we should behave. There are differences
in husband and wife, not that there are none.

45:15.339 --> 45:22.289
But they should not be exposed. Children should
not be exposed to your differences, to your

45:22.289 --> 45:28.289
fights, to your angers and fits. They get
it; they are so, I am again saying, they are

45:28.289 --> 45:35.289
so protected. So much protection is given
to them. These protected children take these

45:35.940 --> 45:42.940
things very quickly. If mother says to the
father something, father says to the mother,

45:44.460 --> 45:50.710
they'll repeat it later on. You will be surprised,
same thing. When the father does something,

45:50.710 --> 45:57.710
they'll say same thing. So you are spoiling
their whole attitude towards life. Must understand,

46:00.160 --> 46:07.160
children are much faster than you are in picking
up things because they have to learn, they

46:11.779 --> 46:17.150
are growing up.
So your relationship between you and your

46:17.150 --> 46:24.150
wife should be of respect, should be of love
and understanding and caring. But there should

46:29.519 --> 46:36.519
not be something of ... some sort of a scene
that is not good for them. I mean, that doesn't

46:42.469 --> 46:49.229
mean that you behave in a funny manner before
the children. That is for the bedroom, all

46:49.229 --> 46:55.259
right? Thank God, you have bedrooms separate.
We don't even have that. In India, very few

46:55.259 --> 47:02.259
people have bedrooms closed. In the day time,
if they close bedrooms, people think, "Are

47:02.749 --> 47:09.749
they mad or sick?" So this is the attitude
that one has to take that before others, before

47:10.969 --> 47:17.969
other people, before the children and everything,
we have to behave. Now if you want to find

47:19.380 --> 47:26.380
faults with each other, you can find it in
the bedroom. That's not a very good game I

47:27.900 --> 47:32.269
think, why should you find? It's always better
to close the chapter at the end of the day

47:32.269 --> 47:38.969
and sleep well. All this I am telling you
that you should not miss the point of joy

47:38.969 --> 47:45.690
and happiness. This is how you will really
enjoy your children, your husband, your wife,

47:45.690 --> 47:51.690
everything. In this, as I have always said
that the wife has to be very wise. She's the

47:51.690 --> 47:56.940
one who has to be very wise. But not to such
an extent that she allows her husband to do

47:56.940 --> 47:57.690
what he likes. She has to keep a control,
in a way, that he doesn't disturb the society

47:57.690 --> 47:58.180
of Sahaja Yoga.
About other things, like we have about, they

47:58.180 --> 48:02.160
said, I didn't know that you are paying some
money for the school and all those people

48:02.160 --> 48:02.529
who are not even having children in the school
are paying. I didn't know this. School has

48:02.529 --> 48:08.799
money, no doubt. There's no problem on that
because they are not spending much. But now

48:08.799 --> 48:15.799
you change the pattern. I'll talk to your
leader, and see. And also you can have a proper

48:16.630 --> 48:23.630
house on rent, separately and get all the
children there to study, and nobody should

48:24.660 --> 48:31.660
act arbitrarily. And it should be done properly.
I'll talk to your leader and tell him. And

48:32.420 --> 48:39.420
the children should be seen, even by the leaders,
to see that they don't become racist or they

48:40.930 --> 48:47.930
do not become violent. And I think Indian
teachers would be a better idea, because you

48:48.999 --> 48:55.700
see they, they are mild people and it would
be better. And I have also discovered you

48:55.700 --> 49:00.680
have two girls who can work, Indian girls.
It's better that they should look after the

49:00.680 --> 49:07.680
children.
And lastly I have to say, I really enjoyed

49:11.140 --> 49:18.140
My stay in Sydney. Really. I don't know why
this was called as Sydney, what was the reason

49:27.559 --> 49:34.549
-- and also in the West they don't have meaning
for every name. But it's a very beautiful

49:34.549 --> 49:41.549
place where so many Sahaja yogis are there.
And I really feel very happy in your company.

49:42.160 --> 49:49.160
I love you and you all love Me. Whatever I
want is your happiness and joy. And please

49:54.789 --> 50:01.789
remember that we are here to enjoy, all of
us. So don't do anything that makes you unhappy,

50:03.989 --> 50:10.369
like having big, big plans, this, that. Not
necessary. There's no need, and if you want

50:10.369 --> 50:16.839
to have you please let Me know. I'll tell
you exactly whether you should do it or not.

50:16.839 --> 50:23.839
Because I don't want you to land up as bankrupts,
or this and that, like madcap people everywhere.

50:24.390 --> 50:31.089
So this is, you have to be careful, you just
inform Me. You let Me know. You can write

50:31.089 --> 50:35.200
to Me that you have such plans and all that,
I'll tell you.

50:35.200 --> 50:40.509
Now this idea of this artist business is,
now that doesn't go into My head, I must say.

50:40.509 --> 50:44.180
They have told Me that they want to get all
the artists together of the world and this

50:44.180 --> 50:51.180
and that. It's a very one-sided attitude to
form, you see. Just a few artists are there,

50:51.880 --> 50:58.880
then they invite them, and they invite here
and a conference start. That sort of a thing

50:59.140 --> 51:03.329
should not be. If there are artists, all right,
there are artists abroad, everywhere they

51:03.329 --> 51:10.079
are. And wherever you can meet them, you can
meet them. But you cannot separate a body

51:10.079 --> 51:13.529
like that, artists are separately, musicians
separately, then you'll have politicians,

51:13.529 --> 51:20.529
then economists, you see.
So that's not Sahaj standard. That's not Sahaj

51:23.499 --> 51:29.269
Yoga, that's the way people live, you see,
they have separately some sort of a thing,

51:29.269 --> 51:36.269
or if not, they can have a organization of,
say broomstick women, something like that.

51:42.450 --> 51:47.329
So we are Sahaja yogis, and we are Sahaja
yogis and Sahaja yogis. If you are artists,

51:47.329 --> 51:53.200
is by the way. If you are musicians, is by
the way. We are Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yogis.

51:53.200 --> 51:59.259
This is one has to remember. Like this the
groups will start. And this clubbing system

51:59.259 --> 52:04.430
has been there in the human nature, has been
there through out. We have been clubbing with

52:04.430 --> 52:10.979
anything. You know, if there's somebody like
the French, they put their spoon the other

52:10.979 --> 52:17.979
way round, you see, spoon and fork like that.
So I said, "Why?"

52:18.440 --> 52:24.299
"Because we're French."
I couldn't understand this explanation, "these

52:24.299 --> 52:30.160
are French". And then the English put it this
way. Now if you just put it the other way

52:30.160 --> 52:37.160
round, I mean, you are a gone case, then you
are no good. So we have to know that this

52:38.539 --> 52:44.489
kind of clubbing was in the human nature because
it comes from the animal instinct. You see

52:44.489 --> 52:51.219
animals also club together. You are from Brisbane?
All right, we sit together. You are from here,

52:51.219 --> 52:58.219
we sit together. It's a animal instinct. Because
of some sort of a fear maybe, that they club

52:58.660 --> 53:03.549
together. This clubbing, clubbing has come
to human race also. For everything you have

53:03.549 --> 53:09.039
a club, you know that.
For you it is not necessary because you have

53:09.039 --> 53:16.039
come out of that state of animal instinct
to higher instincts. Yes, you are an artist.

53:17.180 --> 53:22.219
All right, you are an artist. So another is
an artist, all right. But don't club together

53:22.219 --> 53:28.859
as artists, as musicians, as this, as that.
As long as you have to say sing together,

53:28.859 --> 53:34.329
you can practice, again finished. It's very
important point. Try to understand. Clubbing

53:34.329 --> 53:41.329
is not at all a human quality. Clubbing is
a quality of animals. So when we are all Sahaja

53:43.609 --> 53:49.749
yogis, why should we club together? What is
the need to club? And this clubbing has brought

53:49.749 --> 53:55.559
so much problem to us. This politicians, then
this religions, and all this nothing but clubbing

53:55.559 --> 54:02.559
-- that separates. So anytime you find there's
a clubbing system working anywhere, just run

54:04.089 --> 54:11.089
away from there. You belong to a very big
community. Now say in My hand, these fingers

54:11.229 --> 54:18.229
start clubbing, what will I do with them?
I'll have to make a club out of it. But still

54:20.700 --> 54:27.700
going on. I mean when they come to Ganapatipule
there had clubs going on there also. I've

54:28.079 --> 54:35.079
been informed about them. Australian club,
and north Australian then south Australians,

54:36.239 --> 54:43.239
then east, west and southeast, southwest,
so all that has to be given up. One has to

54:44.599 --> 54:50.219
understand that we are all Sahaja yogis, all
over the world, wherever we may live, whatever

54:50.219 --> 54:57.219
we may eat, whatever we may wear. We are inside
all Sahaja yogis, and all connected to all-pervading

54:58.900 --> 55:05.900
power. If you become great artistes because
you have got Sahaja Yoga, all right, enjoy

55:06.369 --> 55:11.140
that. If you became great musicians, all right,
enjoy that. If you become an orator, enjoy

55:11.140 --> 55:18.140
that. But you don't club yourself with another
person on those grounds. That is something

55:19.069 --> 55:26.069
not at all Sahaj. In Sahaj you are one with
every one, and with all of them.

55:26.949 --> 55:33.469
See now, My life if it is anything, you should
understand that I am extremely a sahaj person,

55:33.469 --> 55:39.849
extremely sahaj. So wherever I go, I can't
understand. I go to Russia, all these Russians,

55:39.849 --> 55:46.849
they had never known about Me, they have never
heard about Me, they came to listen to Me.

55:47.069 --> 55:52.900
Anywhere I go. I mean later on the follow
up may not be that good, but wherever I go

55:52.900 --> 55:59.900
there are in thousands of people. After all
what is so great about Me? See this is it.

56:02.380 --> 56:08.920
What you have to learn -- I am so sahaj and
also when I tell you about, you don't feel

56:08.920 --> 56:15.619
bad. Because you know, you know I am telling
you out of compassion and love, and that is

56:15.619 --> 56:22.170
important. You understand that because first
thing is compassion and love. And when there

56:22.170 --> 56:27.140
is compassion and love, you cannot think of
clubbing at all, never. You can never club

56:27.140 --> 56:33.680
with anyone. You will love each and every
person, and be kind and enjoy your compassion,

56:33.680 --> 56:36.640
the virtue of your compassion, virtue of your
love.

56:36.640 --> 56:43.640
And that is, that shows on your faces, you
shine compared to those born again, who were

56:44.029 --> 56:51.029
never born again. They were looking so hazard
and horrible, very harsh faces, with such

56:55.849 --> 57:02.079
a young girl, she had all the wrinkles you
could count on her face, going round and round

57:02.079 --> 57:04.719
and round.
So I told her, "You are not born again, I

57:04.719 --> 57:06.259
am sorry."
She said, "Are You?"

57:06.259 --> 57:11.749
I said, "I am. Look at your face in the mirror.
You will know, you are not born again."

57:11.749 --> 57:18.749
So the greatest advantage of Sahaja Yoga is
that you can enjoy everything. That is the

57:18.989 --> 57:25.989
greatest advantage, whether it is art, architecture,
music, or a lecture, or studies, education,

57:27.989 --> 57:34.989
family life, everything you should be able
to enjoy fully. Then you are a real Sahaja

57:35.890 --> 57:42.209
yogi and that you have achieved that state.
Sometimes there are problems, here and there,

57:42.209 --> 57:49.049
something happens, doesn't matter. Have faith,
and you will be surprised at the miracles

57:49.049 --> 57:56.049
that you get. One after another, so many miracles,
but listen to Me and also try to follow what

57:58.900 --> 58:04.799
I say.
First of all, no temper. Temper if you have,

58:04.799 --> 58:10.059
you must know that it's a serious thing in
the West because there's no controlling power

58:10.059 --> 58:17.059
over temper, and schizophrenia is the only
ultimate result of temper. So temper should

58:19.289 --> 58:26.289
not be justified. All ego, temper should be
brought down. One should not try in any way

58:29.229 --> 58:34.709
to get angry with others because of jealousy,
because of complexes, because of anything.

58:34.709 --> 58:41.709
If it is so, please introspect, "Why do I
get into tempers?" Shri Krishna has placed

58:46.969 --> 58:51.789
temper as the worst disease of all, He said
from there it rises everything. But I don't

58:51.789 --> 58:57.130
agree with Him because, you see, it must be,
He was, for Him it's a leela, the whole world

58:57.130 --> 59:04.130
is a leela, but not for everyone. Temper can
come from Mooladhara, can come from Swadishtana,

59:04.769 --> 59:11.769
can come from anywhere. So one cannot say
that the source of temper is going to be the

59:13.519 --> 59:20.519
source of all the problems, can be from anything.
One can really get destroyed by anything,

59:20.880 --> 59:26.009
but temper is one thing that is the worst
of all.

59:26.009 --> 59:33.009
So, if you find anybody who is hot tempered,
if you find yourself to be hot tempered, then

59:33.920 --> 59:40.920
please see to it that you overcome it. I used
to tell before, I don't know now, there must

59:42.579 --> 59:47.289
be My tapes that if you are very angry, then
stand before the mirror and say all kinds

59:47.289 --> 59:54.289
of things. Or else you take a pillow and hit
it hard when you are in temper. Close the

59:55.039 --> 01:00:01.479
door, hit the pillow and then go out. You
may have to spend for another pillow, doesn't

01:00:01.479 --> 01:00:08.479
matter. So you develop a very, I should say,
a pleasing personality. That's very important.

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:18.130
You must have a very pleasing personality.
But that is not acceptable in certain countries

01:00:25.279 --> 01:00:31.459
because it's said that you should not show
your, any pleasing personality, because others

01:00:31.459 --> 01:00:38.459
will think you are weak. The strength is your
joy. Strength is your virtue, strength is

01:00:40.989 --> 01:00:47.829
your pleasing personality. That is your strength.
And this artificially, some people say that

01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:52.630
if you become very pleasing and this and that,
then others will think you are weak. If they

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:59.630
think, let them think like that. That is their
stupidity. So you should be happy, joyous,

01:01:00.219 --> 01:01:05.930
pleasing.
I must say in Sahaja Yoga some people have

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:12.930
come up so well that I really feel very proud
of them, very proud. And also, I never expected

01:01:14.299 --> 01:01:21.299
this to work out so well in My lifetime, I
never expected because I started it very late,

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:30.190
deliberately. So it is very heartening to
see so many Sahaja yogis coming up, and listening

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:37.880
to Me so nicely without taking any objection
to what I say, and then imbibing it in their

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.279
lives so that they can enjoy themselves very
well.

01:01:45.279 --> 01:01:52.279
This time I had to meet people separately
and in one room and all, but next time I think

01:01:55.259 --> 01:02:00.329
I'll discuss certain problems openly. If you
people are doing something stupid which, let

01:02:00.329 --> 01:02:07.329
us, all of us know. So that there'll be some
fear of people who are doing wrong things.

01:02:07.569 --> 01:02:14.569
For example, I don't know is he here, Peter
Patten, is he here? He's not here? Peter Patten

01:02:17.739 --> 01:02:24.739
from Adelaide. He has been very funny, and
he has to get out of Sahaja Yoga I think,

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:36.349
for some time.
Then there's one Mark, is he here? Where is

01:02:37.569 --> 01:02:44.569
he? Just call him. So you see, he doesn't
realize what's wrong with him. And he is trying

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:55.619
to force himself on to others. Is not a very
good idea. You all take a bandhan, I think

01:02:55.619 --> 01:03:02.619
you see, it's all right. Where is he? So we
will have a open talk about it, so you will

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:20.589
realize what's wrong with the person. Extremely
right-sided is, the whole thing is burning.

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:35.890
Where is he? What's the matter with you? Why
do you want to meet Me?

01:03:48.759 --> 01:03:55.759
[Mark: I was just going to get some directions
from You, Shri Mataji.]

01:04:03.499 --> 01:04:05.479
What direction?
[Mark: Just about what I should be doing,

01:04:05.479 --> 01:04:09.319
as far as more involvement in ....]
I mean, just think of it, if I have to talk

01:04:09.319 --> 01:04:11.650
to each person like that, what will be My
situation?

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:17.150
[Mark: Yes Shri Mataji.]
So why should you force your way like that?

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:24.150
You could have written a letter to Me, I would
have known whatever you wanted. You see, now

01:04:24.509 --> 01:04:30.999
try to understand what's your problem is.
Your problem is right side. All right? Sit

01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:37.999
down and remove it. That's your problem. You
can find it out very easily, what your problem

01:04:38.239 --> 01:04:43.009
is, and which you can solve. You can also
talk to the leaders but you have to be humble

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:49.390
about it. You should not be aggressive. "I
must meet Mataji, I must meet Mataji." You

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:56.390
see, supposing you all want to meet Me individually,
what will happen? And you will be amazed only

01:04:58.599 --> 01:05:03.589
in Sydney I meet people like this. Only I
have been meeting and meeting and meeting.

01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:10.589
For that, now I would say that you should
tell your leaders first. Let them scan you

01:05:10.979 --> 01:05:16.719
out, let them write what are their problems
are. Then if I want to see, I'll see. I should

01:05:16.719 --> 01:05:23.719
have that much freedom. You can't force things
on Me, can you? I have not taken a contract

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:34.569
with you or anything. So all of you who want
to see Me, should not talk to Vinay, because

01:05:34.569 --> 01:05:41.219
he's now fed up. He's so tired, he doesn't
know. Everybody is pressurizing him. So now

01:05:41.219 --> 01:05:46.469
please tell your leader. Leader has to give
Me your problems. Then I'll see, if I want

01:05:46.469 --> 01:05:53.469
to see or if I don't want to see. We have
to stop this. There's nothing special, nothing

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:04.650
great that you cannot tell the leader. The
leader can solve your problem. Because I have

01:06:05.759 --> 01:06:12.759
to go from countries to counties, you know
that. Even in Australia, I travel from cities

01:06:16.569 --> 01:06:23.569
to city, which I do not do in anywhere. Even
in India, only two places I go to or only

01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:32.609
the capital. But I feel concerned about you.
You have gone through bumpy areas.

01:06:34.359 --> 01:06:38.559
But try to understand that there's no contract
with Me. If you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:45.559
doesn't mean that you have right to do what
you like. No. I must cure, I must touch person,

01:06:47.499 --> 01:06:54.049
I must see. This is too much. What have you
done for Sahaja Yoga. Ask this question, "What

01:06:54.049 --> 01:07:01.049
have I done for Sahaja Yoga? How many people
I have given realization?" I've been just

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:09.910
fighting with others, having family problems,
this, that or "Have I done anything which

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:16.839
is constructive to help Mother?" As you know,
My age is now seventy-one, I don't know how

01:07:16.839 --> 01:07:19.900
far My husband will allow Me to travel now,
also. Whatever it is.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:25.869
You have to take over. You have to take the
responsibility. You have all the powers, you

01:07:25.869 --> 01:07:32.869
have all the knowledge. You are quite all
right now for Sahaja Yoga spreading. So go

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:41.660
ahead. You are wise enough to understand that
now we should spare our Mother. So nobody

01:07:45.339 --> 01:07:51.579
should be aggressive like that. All right?
If I have to see somebody, I will see. But

01:07:51.579 --> 01:07:56.809
first of all you must tell your leaders and
give them the full reason why you want to

01:07:56.809 --> 01:08:02.309
see Me, and if I think it proper, I'll see.
This much freedom you should give Me that

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:09.309
if I want, I'll see you. There is some sort
of a protocol is there for people that they

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:24.109
should understand that you cannot just ask
to see Me just like that.

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:35.790
As you love Me, you can feel for Me also and
understand that what is important is you should

01:08:37.059 --> 01:08:44.059
go deep down into yourself and I am there.
I am there, absolutely. I am everywhere. You

01:08:46.559 --> 01:08:53.559
need not see My face or see Me. I am there.
Just know this fact that I am there with you

01:08:53.609 --> 01:09:00.609
all the time whether you write to Me, whether
you inform Me or not. There are people who

01:09:00.989 --> 01:09:07.839
have developed such, such tremendous faith
that Mother is everywhere, that just by praying

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:14.839
they have saved the lives of people. Just
from praying. There are many like that. And

01:09:16.259 --> 01:09:22.429
really, it is worth seeing these people, how
simple they are. I won't even see them normally,

01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:29.429
anywhere. But they are there. And they told
Me how they have achieved so many things so

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:37.400
easily. It is very remarkable.
There was one fellow whose mother was sick

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:45.480
in Rohtak and he was in, I think, Bombay and
he received a message that she is sick and

01:09:47.239 --> 01:09:52.250
she will die very soon. So he rushed to the
place and they told him that within three

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:58.179
days she will be finished. His mother is not
a realized soul nor she's a Sahaja yogini,

01:09:58.179 --> 01:10:05.030
she has never even seen Me. He said, "Mother
I couldn't help it. I just went on my knees

01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:12.030
and I just prayed, 'oh Mother, please can
You save my mother?'" Within three days the

01:10:12.559 --> 01:10:18.340
lady got all right. They said it's a galloping
cancer. He flew her to Bombay and took her

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:25.190
to the Tata hospital to find out if there
is any cancer. They said, "There's no trace

01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:32.190
of cancer." He said, "This is the last time
I have asked You for anything." I just, I

01:10:34.559 --> 01:10:41.559
just -- it has happened with many.
So it is your faith. Faith is not blind in

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.230
Sahaja Yoga, you know for definite what is
Sahaja Yoga is. You have seen miraculous photographs.

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:53.980
You have seen all the miracles happening.
So now your faith should be completely, entirely

01:10:53.980 --> 01:11:00.980
in it. And it will work out. I promise you
if your faith is deep enough to reach Me,

01:11:02.679 --> 01:11:03.980
you don't have to see My face, even not to
have My photograph, nothing. Wherever you

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.270
are, you'll find Me. That's why I always say,
"Develop your faith, develop your faith."

01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.429
May God bless you!
May God bless you!

01:11:04.429 --> 01:11:05.880
So thank you again and again for all these
flowers and for all the nice time I had here.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:05.889
it.
== Note ==

01:11:05.889 --> 01:11:05.900
especially when Shri Mataji is reprimanding
some yogis (mark), the transcribing team has

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:05.909
nevertheless included this content not knowing
whether it should really be excluded.So, thank

01:11:05.909 --> 01:11:05.920
you very much for the greetings on this day.
It was a Easter Monday when I got married

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:05.929
always changes according to the Monday it
comes.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:05.940
So it was quite a big venture for Me to marry.
Actually, I did not need it at all. But as

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:06.050
you know in India, they won't spare any girl
from marriage, and they have been after My

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.110
life since I was about eighteen years of age.
So somehow I managed. But I was in the medical

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.159
college Lahore, and suddenly the disturbances
broke out of a very serious nature. And I

01:11:06.159 --> 01:11:06.219
came back, and there was no possibility of
My going back. Then the whole thing planned,

01:11:06.219 --> 01:11:06.280
I think Divine planned it for My marriage,
because I had to accept them. And as My husband

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:06.329
was there, there were many proposals also,
which they chose this one, and I was married.

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:06.400
In a way arranged, because I had never talked
to him about it, he had not talked to Me,

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:06.449
but he had seen Me once before.
So for Me it was all right because everybody

01:11:06.449 --> 01:11:06.510
so much worried in My family about My marriage
all the time. Throughout I feel that I looked

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.570
after My husband's relations, family, though
he had none. He had only one sister whose

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:06.619
grandson is Vinay. And all the rest of the
family, all those relations of his, I really

01:11:06.619 --> 01:11:06.670
looked after them. And he was counting, he
said, "You have looked after thirty-five nephews,"

01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:06.909
only nephews and how many nieces and how many?
Because it was nature, you see, of compassion,

01:11:06.909 --> 01:11:06.909
was well placed in life because he had never
bothered about his lands and things. So he

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:08.559
came for the wedding of My granddaughter,
and also of My daughters, and showed their

01:11:08.559 --> 01:11:09.329
gratitude. Out of them very few have come
to Sahaja Yoga. Actually, the relations are

01:11:09.329 --> 01:11:10.000
always like that. They are so close that I
tell them there's a black point, you know,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:10.050
where everything dissolves into zero. So they
are so close that they cannot see what is

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:10.090
Sahaja Yoga. They have tremendous regard for
Me. They have tremendous respect for Me. They

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:10.139
will do anything, especially My husband has
spent lot of money in the beginning of Sahaja

01:11:10.139 --> 01:11:10.190
Yoga, quite a lot. He doesn't ask for it;
he never mentioned it also. And we has spent

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:10.239
so much of his money. We had a joint account;
he never questioned Me, nothing of the kind.

01:11:10.239 --> 01:11:10.280
Very sweet of him.
So the situation is better now. They have

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:10.329
faith in Sahaja Yoga. They try to meditate
also. But they are not seekers, in a way,

01:11:10.329 --> 01:11:10.380
because they are so close to Me. As you people
have an advantage, great advantage you have

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:10.420
that firstly you are seekers from ages, and
you understand how important it is to get

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:10.469
your Self-realization, because you feel lost
without it. You think that if you don't get

01:11:10.469 --> 01:11:10.510
your Self-realization, you should commit suicide,
and there are many letters I have got saying

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.559
that "We were mad. We were seeking, going
to this person, going to that person." Such

01:11:10.559 --> 01:11:10.860
big, big letters I got from them how they
were cheated, how they were tortured, and

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.010
how they had spent money and how they were
completely lynched by these gurus. Some of

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:11.150
them had to sell their houses, and children
were, they moved from schools, and everybody

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:11.300
became extremely poor. So this was in London
much worse. Later on I found that every country

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:11.400
has this problem, they became drug addicts
and all that.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:11.630
Despite all that now we have so many people
who are Sahaja Yogis all over the world, not

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.929
only in Australia. But Australia has quite
a lot of Sahaja Yogis, I must say. And quantity

01:11:11.929 --> 01:11:12.040
is very, very large and good, and people are
nice, but we have had, as I told you, a very

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:12.139
bumpy start. Because of that, certain conditionings
are built up in people. But now we have to

01:11:12.139 --> 01:11:12.300
see that our quality has to improve. Quality
has to improve, and the test of quality, I

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:12.300
the artists together of the world and this
and that. It's a very one-sided attitude to
