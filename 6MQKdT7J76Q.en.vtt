00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:10.540
History of humanity in the history of evolution

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.420
in the history of spirituality

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.200
is the most important time because

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.100
here you will get

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.880
what Heaven has been promised to you so far.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.560
Our planet is moving in a spiral way.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.760
All the planets are moving in a spiral way,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.320
and they are creating all possible things

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.960
for the use of human beings

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.560
so that they can save time.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.300
Save time for getting their ascent

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.840
and for meditative growth.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660
This is the left side. This is the right side.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.860
This is the left sympathetic nervous system, say.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880
And this is the right sympathetic nervous system.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.460
And really spinal cord looks like this.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700
And inside here is the spinal cord,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.460
which has the centers in it, the subtle centers.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.240
Now when you start using the energy of these centers,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.840
say, too much on the right.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.200
And it starts moving more towards the right.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.040
And there is a constriction.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.280
And the power becomes less

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.900
because you are exhausted,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.400
going more to the right side.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.020
Suddenly something happens

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.860
and from the left, if there is a jerk,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.720
then the connection is completely broken.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.760
This is on its own.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.240
It starts working on its own.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.340
That's what you say

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640
that this will become malignant.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.820
I have no relationship with the whole

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.620
to have the proportionate growth.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.340
So if the nose starts developing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160
it can cover your eyes

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.420
and govern your mouth, everything.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420
This is how a cancer is setting

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.020
or any other disease.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.420
And so many psychosomatic diseases

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.540
are nothing but somatic.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.480
[It] is from the right side.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.480
And when the psyche gives in,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.820
then it becomes a psychosomatic disease.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.320
There are so many diseases which are

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.700
more psychosomatic than physical,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.320
and these, we call them as incurable,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.840
can be easily cured by Kundalini awakening,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.720
because when Kundalini passes through this,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.800
She just integrates them. For example,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.120
She is going like this, and she goes into this,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.320
integrates them.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.300
Just like She strings them.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.560
And also She nourishes that center.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.740
That's how people get cured

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.920
automatically by themselves, by their own Power.
