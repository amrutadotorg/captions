00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.640
This is the quality of a person like carbon has got four valences you have got these ten valences

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.550
and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.540
If these valances are missing then what happens that, as in the combination of chemical combinations

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.370
you have seen if one valence is missing it becomes a negative and then

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.109
It combines with that. So there are negative and positive balances

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.450
So if you have some additional valences with you

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.400
Then you jump on to other people if you have less then you catch from other people

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.820
It's exactly the same as it happens in a chemical compound

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.360
Now these valences within us are to be there to give us a balance, and that's what Warren has told you what it means.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.460
When you get your realization your dharma

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.820
Your ten commandments get enlightened means you get empowered

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.220
You become that.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.460
You go beyond religion. You don't have to follow it. Just become you become so integrated for example,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.940
some people it does it so to have say potatoes. They will just not like it just don't like it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.340
Before realize it's just the other way now [if] they are not supposed to eat potatoes they'll eat potatoes more

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.160
After realization won't just have it, you won't have it. You are so integrated

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.300
The sustainance within us gets so enlightened

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.840
that our priorities change completely. We start judging everything on vibrations

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.880
Now we have a little girl here you've seen - olympia

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.700
She eats very little, practically solid food she does not eat, but if I give her anything to eat she will eat

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.740
From nobody else, but if I give her anything, she'll ask for more anything

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.280
It's surprising she understands vibrations

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.420
If you understand vibrations, then it is very easy to retain your valencies intact

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
Because you are empowered

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.420
Not only that, but you just don't like anything else because you like the vibrations to flow

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.600
When the vibrations are flowing the spirit is emitting

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.660
through your Central Nervous system the Joy

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.000
That is the quality of your spirit. The joy you start feeling and when you start feeling the joy

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.720
Then you don't want to give up. for anything. Just don't want to give up. you want to enjoy
