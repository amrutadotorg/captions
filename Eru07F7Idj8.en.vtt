00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.480
Today we have gathered here

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.520
to worship Shri Krishna.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.880
We must understand the significance

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.000
of Shri Krishna's advent

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.760
on the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.640
As you know very well, except for once or twice,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.360
Shri Brahmadeva has taken his incarnation.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:44.120
Also once Shri Ganesha has taken His birth

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.520
as Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.200
But Vishnu Tattwa, the principle of Vishnu,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.520
has taken many a times birth on this earth,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.040
as the Goddess had to take many a times Her birth.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.600
They had to work together many a times,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.960
and with the principle of Vishnu,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.560
the principle of Mahalakshmi has acted

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.960
to help the ascent of the people.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:32.440
So the principle of Vishnu is for your ascent,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.040
for the evolutionary process of human beings.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.520
Through this advent

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.680
and through the power of Mahalakshmi,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:56.360
we have become human beings from amoeba stage.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:04.760
This is a spontaneous working for us

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.080
but for the principle of Vishnu,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:16.800
He had to go through various incarnations to evolve.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.760
As you know there have been incarnations

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.480
of Shri Vishnu as a fish to begin with

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:36.240
and went on till it came to the state of Shri Krishna,

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.640
where they say that He has become complete.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.400
But one has to realize that

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.200
He works on our central nervous system,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.840
He builds our central nervous system.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.240
Through our evolutionary process,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.680
our central nervous system has been built up,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.080
and this central nervous system has given us

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.800
all the human awareness that we have;

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.640
otherwise we would have been just like the stones.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.520
But through this building up of our awareness,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.280
one after another,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.200
building up different chakras within us,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.440
this principle of Vishnu has brought us to the understanding

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.160
that we have to seek the truth

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.160
and ultimately we have to become Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.960
So this principle of Shri Krishna

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.440
is so important that at the state,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720
as you call it the Vishuddhi chakra

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.760
we become complete,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.480
in the sense that when the Sahasrara is opened out for you

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.720
and you start feeling the vibrations,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.400
you are not yet fully complete.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.280
If you were just complete then it would have been

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.120
an end of your evolution,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.640
because at that stage, if you had finished it,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.360
then there was no need to have Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.360
But actually it means that once the Sahasrara is opened out,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.920
then you have to come down to your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.720
that means to your collective.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.600
If it is not working on your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.120
the enlightenment on Vishuddhi chakra,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.040
you cannot feel the vibrations.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.840
As you saw yesterday,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.400
the artists started playing in a very new dimension.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.880
It's not that only they got awakening of the Kundalini.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.200
The awakening of the Kundalini was there, no doubt,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.040
but it had to come down to their Vishuddhi chakra.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.240
If I could not have brought it back to their Vishuddhi chakra,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.840
their hands could not have moved that fast,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.760
they would have never felt the sweetness,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.080
the madhurya of Shri Krishna,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.160
and they would not have manifested it.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.880
So all that is expressed through your fingers and hands

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.200
achieves that new awareness of creating the madhurya,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.000
the sweetness.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.480
In your art, in your music,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.640
in your gestures,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.640
in every way, your hands are very important.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.040
But Vishuddhi chakra also plays part, as you know,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.840
on the sixteen chakras or the sub-plexuses

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.240
which look after our face,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.120
our ears, nose, eyes, neck,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.000
all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.360
As a result also, you can become great actors,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.320
you can have eyes which are innocent,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.840
you can have a skin which is shining,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.560
you can have ears which can hear the Divine music,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.760
you can have a nose which shows your dignity.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:33.840
In the same way, your whole facial expression changes.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.200
If you are a very harsh person

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.840
and a hot-tempered person

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.200
and you have harshness on your face,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.280
or else if you are like a beggar all the time,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.280
or you are crying all the time, weeping,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.360
your face looks so miserable,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.320
everything changes and comes into the center,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.280
where you look beautiful, you look attractive,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.560
in the Divine way, and also you get

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.120
a very sweet countenance.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.960
Also the teeth and the tongue

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.840
are looked after by the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.920
So your teeth which are in trouble get cured.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.880
You sometimes, as I told you

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.360
I have never been to a dentist all my life.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.960
So you can imagine that you don't have to go to the dentist any more

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.280
if you have your Vishuddhi chakra all right.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.520
Then also your tongue improves.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.080
For example some people are very sarcastic by temperament.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.720
They cannot say something sweetly,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.400
all the time they are sarcastic, saying sarcastic things.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.560
Some people have a habit of abusive language.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:56.840
Some people are extremely beggarish type,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.600
all the time talking in a very beggarish manner.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.600
There's no dignity, there's no sweetness

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.880
and there is no self-confidence for some people.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.880
Some people even stammer,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.280
some people cannot stand on the stage and give a lecture.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.120
All these things drop out

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.240
as soon as your Vishuddhi chakra improves.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.680
This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.760
of the Vishuddhi chakra's improvement within yourself,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.040
through the awakening of Shri Krishna on Vishuddhi chakra.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:37.040
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.240
You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.600
all that is troubling you, all that is a problem,

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.040
you just start watching it,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.200
you start witnessing it, you start seeing it,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.000
and you do not get disturbed.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.600
That seeing, that witnessing state

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.120
has a tremendous power.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.080
Whatever you see without thinking,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.320
your problems get solved.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.000
Any problem you have, once you get this witness state

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.840
- what you call 'tatasth'-

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.360
means you are standing on the shores

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.200
and so watching the waves to move -

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.000
then you know how to solve the problems.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.960
So your witness state has to be developed

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.680
and sometimes I have seen,

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.200
people have to go through little difficulties

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.680
to develop that witness state.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.520
This is very important that once the Kundalini starts

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.840
supplying you from your Sahasrara downward,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.760
moving on your chakras

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.480
and enriching your different chakras,

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.280
on the Vishuddhi chakra

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.560
when it has to stay, it really tries to

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.720
little bit take you through turmoils

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.400
and you start thinking that, "See now, my life was so blissful.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.960
I had so many blessings and now what has happened?"

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.000
But this is the time when you should become tatastha,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.040
means you should become a witness.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.280
If you become a witness everything improves.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:22.320
For example you are say a person who is working in some place.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.800
As soon as you become a witness, you see,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.040
your attention goes inside

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.840
and you start watching things from inside out.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.600
As a result you see exactly what's wrong, where,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.320
and as you have got the power of witnessing,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.920
with that power you get over the problems that you have.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.800
Problems get solved very easily

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
if you know how to witness the whole situation

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.040
than to get involved into it.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.840
And this is the best state which you call as Sakshiswarupatva,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.480
which you achieve when the Kundalini comes up

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.960
and the connection is established

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.920
and the Divine ray starts flowing through that

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.120
and enriches your Vishuddhi chakra.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.040
Now the name of Shri Krishna has come from the word 'krishi'

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.840
meaning 'the ploughing',

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.480
'ploughing' of the soil

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.360
for planting the crops.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.840
Now He is the one who has done the ploughing for us,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.880
in the sense that He has created us in such a manner

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.080
that when the sprouting has to be done

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.840
you are already ready for it.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.000
But as it is we human beings spoil our Vishuddhi chakra

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.960
by many wrong things, as you have seen that

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.200
we smoke or we take drugs,

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.760
or we take tobaccos and all that.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.120
So our Vishuddhi chakra goes out.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.920
On top of that, if you are a person who doesn't talk at all

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.200
or who talks too much or who shouts and screams

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.040
and who shows temper, raises his voices,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.640
also spoils his Vishuddhi chakra.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.560
So the first thing is that in your

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.440
using the Vishuddhi chakra, you have to remember

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.080
it is to be used for sweetness, for madhurya.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.440
If you want to say something to someone,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.560
try to say something that is sweet and nice,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.280
practice it.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.840
In certain places I have seen

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.560
that people are used to a kind of a talk

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.720
and sometimes they cannot talk in the fashion that is sweet.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.760
For them it is adharma as if to talk sweetly to someone.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.880
They only believe that you must really talk in a manner

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.760
that will hurt others.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.800
So hurting anybody is not in the dharma of Shri Krishna.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.960
He either killed somebody

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.200
or He was sweet, there's nothing in between.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.920
Either you have to be sweet to people

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.080
or you have to kill someone.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.760
Now killing part you leave it.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.000
So you have to be only sweet.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.320
You all have to be sweet to each other,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.000
specially among Sahaja Yogis

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.680
you have to be extremely sweet to each other.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.840
And dealing with others also sweetly you have to tell

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.360
them if you find anything wrong with them that,

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.840
"See, this is not good. You are now come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.040
Now you must behave like this or behave like that."

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.360
Now Shri Krishna's life has another very

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.960
significant role to play,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.560
that is He came on this earth after Shri Rama's advent,

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.440
who was also Shri Vishnu.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.240
When Shri Rama came the people were very ignorant,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.200
they had no idea about dharma.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.400
So as a king He wanted to teach them dharma

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.000
and so He had to become very serious.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.120
So His incarnation was something

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.120
of a very serious father who is

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.000
very seriously undergoing all kinds of turmoils and things

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.760
and to create an image of a benevolent king.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.760
As a result when He, His incarnation was over,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.560
people became very serious-minded

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.440
and all the seriousness started in the religion,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.160
all the ritualism started;

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.760
people became extremely rigid

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.920
and that rigidity killed all the joy of life

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.920
and then all kinds of other things also

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.280
started with that rigidity, is the beginning of Brahmanism.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.960
Brahmanism started in India when people started

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.080
using Brahmanism as a birthright

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.760
while it is not a birthright of anyone

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.280
to be a Brahmin but you have to become a Brahmin.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.880
After Realization you become a Brahmin,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.120
this fact is established not only

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.360
in Shri Krishna's time, but also in Shri Rama's time

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.360
because Shri Rama Himself was not a Brahmin.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:31.760
He made a person to write His Ramayana,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.800
who was Valmiki, who was a shidul caste

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.880
and was a fisherman.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.680
Very surprising, He asked this fisherman

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.000
to write His Ramayana when he was not a Brahmin,

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.760
and He made him a Brahmin

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.080
in the sense as you have become Brahmins means knowing the Brahma.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.320
Those who know the Brahma are the Brahmins

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.520
and not those who are born in the Brahmin caste are Brahmins.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.520
And that is why people sometimes get very upset

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.240
that how can these be Brahmins if they are so perverse

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.600
and they can commit all kinds of sins.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.240
So by following any such religion or any such rigid ideas

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.600
you cannot improve.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.720
If you call yourself a Christian

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.880
then one thing has to be seen in a Christian

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.320
that you cannot have adulterous eyes.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.400
Now I would like to know how many Christians can claim that.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.120
If they have no adulterous eyes about, say, women,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.040
they'll have adulterous eyes about things.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.000
So you cannot say that, by becoming Christians,

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.640
we have become really Christians;

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.040
in the same way we can say about Hindus.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.560
In the Hindu religion, Krishna has said

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.840
that the Atma resides in everyone.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:56.120
He never said that the birth determines your jati, your caste.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.480
But among Hindus we believe

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.400
that everybody has a jati

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.304
and that everybody is a separate thing;

00:23:03.504 --> 00:23:06.360
some people are to be treated as low, some as high.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.160
This is just the opposite what Shri Krishna has preached,

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.400
because He said in everybody there is Atma.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.160
And now in Sahaja Yoga we have proved

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.410
that whatever religion you may follow,

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:21.130
whatever things you follow, ideas or philosophy,

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.610
whatever you may follow, you all can become realized souls;

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.090
so nobody is higher, nobody is lower.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.554
Is the best thing is to believe

00:23:28.754 --> 00:23:31.410
that all others are wrong and we are correct.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.810
But all of those people who believe like this

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.530
may have to go to hell directly,

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.530
because they have not reached the truth.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.730
The truth is you have to become a realized soul,

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.890
and if you are not a realized soul

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:45.890
you are nowhere near God.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.610
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.690
Christ himself has said that,

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.690
"You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.050
You are to be born again.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.130
And when you'll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ',

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.530
I won't recognize you."

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.490
Openly He has said it, He has warned you.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.130
Same about Mohamed Sahib Himself has said

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.530
"When the time of Qayama, the resurrection, will come,

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.450
your hands will speak".

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.450
And He has also said very clearly,

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.020
"Till the Qayama you do all these things,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.020
like, you see, (rosaiya ?) and all that.

00:24:19.227 --> 00:24:22.466
But when the Qayama comes, when you get your resurrection

00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:26.140
then you don't have to do it." Clearly He said it.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.940
But nobody is trying to find out the Qayama,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.420
only they're trying to find faults with this or that

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.420
and fight with each other.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.300
Now this Resurrection time He has already mentioned,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.200
"When your hands will speak", is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.160
So after this you don't have to do anything.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.400
Now you have become a Pir according to Him.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.040
Once you have become a wali

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.640
you don't have to do all these things and you become dharmatit.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.160
Is said also in Indian philosophy by Shri Krishna that,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.560
"You become dharmatit, you go beyond religion",

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.520
means religion becomes part and parcel of you.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.840
You don't have to have outside religions

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.440
which are of no use. Is clearly said.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.310
 And Shri Krishna has said it as clearly as anybody could say it,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.230
very, very clearly, that you have to go beyond your gunas,

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.750
beyond your dharmas,

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.390
that means you have to become a person who is religious

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.455
innately

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.620
and not to become a person

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.260
who is just outwardly something like Christian, Hindu, Muslim. No.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.190
Inside, inside you have to become.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.510
Now as a result of that you have seen what Shri Krishna has said

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.070
that, "Once you become from inside then I don't have to tell you,

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:50.590
'Don't drink, don't do this, don't do that, nothing'."

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.750
You just don't do it.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.790
You just don't do it and you understand it so well

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.470
that this should not be done, that should not be done.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.340
To overcome all kinds of nonsense of religion

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.256
Shri Krishna's advent was there.

00:26:15.456 --> 00:26:17.576
Is a very important advent but I don't know

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:20.130
how many people understand that.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.650
He came to show that it's all Leela,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.650
is all the play of God.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.650
What is there to be serious?

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.880
What is there to be ritualistic?

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.560
You cannot bind God in any rituals.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.160
That's why He came on this Earth, to tell you

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.560
that you should not try to bind yourself by rituals

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.480
which are nonsensical.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.880
This was His teaching so many years back.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.680
He taught this six thousand years back but still,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.760
if you see in every religion there are so many rituals going on.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.680
So when the incarnations died, people started rituals,

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.960
funny stuff. Even when Shri Krishna died,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.280
they didn't know what to do. Now because He said,

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.360
"No more rituals, just play Holi, be happy, joyous,

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.440
dance and sing", that's what He said,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.600
now what to do now if He has said so?

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.190
So they started a new thing,

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.310
"Let us make it a romantic stuff."

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.130
Human beings know how to make everything perverse;

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.410
nobody can beat them in this.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:27.250
So they made Him look like a very romantic personality,

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:28.970
romancing with Radha.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.560
Radha, 'Ra' is energy, 'Dha' is the one who has sustained energy.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.580
So show romances with Her when She was Mahalakshmi Herself,

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.780
to show His relationship with Mahalakshmi

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.660
as if They were Husband and Wife.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.660
So there were also some poets who started describing them

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.840
as husband and wife, and all kinds of nonsense.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.480
In Divine relationship there is nothing like husband and wife;

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.900
is the power which is potential, and power that is kinetic.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.620
There is no such relationship that exists

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.660
as human beings try to make it,

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.850
because human beings have a habit

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:09.050
to bring all the Divine Incarnations to their own levels.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.010
As you have seen that, if you see,

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.730
the best are the Greeks,

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.520
who brought all the great Incarnations to their own levels.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.760
In the same way they could not do much with Shri Krishna

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.680
so they said, "All right, make him a romantic personality

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.170
that will suit us."

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.210
So it suited many horrible people.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:34.010
We had one Nawab in Lucknow who had 365 wives

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.270
and he used to dress up like Shri Krishna,

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.510
sometimes like Radha, and dance

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.890
and he said, "Now I have become Shri Krishna."

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.050
So, so many, you know, gurus came as Shri Krishna playing flute,

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.090
becoming, calling everybody else as their gopis

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.090
and this and that. All nonsense.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.090
And we have so many groups now working like that,

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:57.650
Brahma Kumaris and all that.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.690
When there is one Krishna, the rest are all gopis and gopas

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.760
and they don't marry and all kinds of nonsense.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.160
This is absolutely absurd and perverse

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.120
and brings bad name to Shri Krishna.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.120
Shri Krishna was Yogeshwara. He was Yogeshwara,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.320
He was so detached that once His wives,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.760
who were His powers, and they said that,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.690
"We want to go across and worship a particular saint."

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.250
He said, "All right, why don't you go?" They said," No,

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.590
the river is in spate and we don't know how to cross the river."

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.710
He said, "All right, you go and tell the river that

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.990
we want to go and see such and such saint

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.740
and Shri Krishna has said that you come down.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.460
If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.540
and if He has had no wife then you go down."

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.700
So they went to the river and said that

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.580
"If Shri Krishna has had no wives

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.820
and He is a Yogeshwara then please go down".

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.758
The river went down. They were surprised,

00:30:02.958 --> 00:30:04.840
that He is supposed to be our husband

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.240
and still He is Yogeshwara. He is so detached.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.480
They crossed over and they went and worshipped the saint.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.380
So the saint said, "Now you can go back."

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.740
When they were coming back, they found again the river was in spate.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.980
So they went back to the saint and they said,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.900
"Now how do we go back?"

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.420
He said, "How did you come?"

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.140
They said, "Shri Krishna said that, 'You go and ask the river

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.310
if I was a Yogeshwara, then you go down'."

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.830
"All right, so you go and ask the river

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.670
that the saint did not eat anything whatsoever

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.070
and he was absolutely detached about it,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.550
so the river will go down."

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.510
So they were surprised because they had fed him,

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.050
he had ate everything, he had done everything.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.450
So they went to the river and said, "Oh river,

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.690
the saint never ate anything,

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.770
he was absolutely detached about food,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.800
he did not touch the food," And the river went down.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.080
So they were surprised, how is it that the saint ate everything

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.760
and did not eat anything?

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.630
Means he was in aswadha, he was not

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.990
involved into the food, he was detached

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:09.990
and they were surprised. Looks like,

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:16.680
It looks like a lie from a, see, human point of view, it is not.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.560
It is not, that's a fact.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.600
He is a Yogeshwara and He is so detached.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.600
So people don't understand Divinity and they think that

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.700
how can it be a person who has 16,000 wives

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.500
and five other wives can be a person who is not yet married?

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.450
Because He was Yogeshwara.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.170
And that is what you all have to be, Yogeshwara.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.530
You are married, you have got children.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.130
I'm happy you are married because that's an auspicious thing to do,

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.290
to marry to begin with.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.810
But you should not get involved with your family,

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.270
"My child, my family."

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.950
Many people I have seen, they come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.010
get married and get lost;

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.930
because to them, "Married now, I'm enjoying my family now,

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.470
looking after my family."

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.710
Our family is the whole universe,

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.990
it is not just my own wife and my children

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.170
but the whole Universe is our family.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.650
And this is what Shri Krishna tried to show in His life

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.610
that the whole Universe is your family.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.760
You are a universal being.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.400
This is what He preached throughout,

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.660
that you are a universal being

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.390
and you have to be a part and parcel of the whole.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.110
You are the part and parcel of the whole,

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.870
the microcosm becomes the macrocosm,

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.390
and this is not a lecture but has to happen within yourself

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.990
that you have to develop your collective consciousness.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.050
And this is the gift of Shri Krishna,

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:54.250
because at the brain He becomes the Virata.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.990
So now we have three identities within ourselves.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.790
On the heart is Shiva,

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.870
in the brain is Shri Krishna, the Virata,

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:11.110
and in the liver, Brahmadeva.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.350
So we have three identities

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.630
and in the stomach, in the Void as you say,

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.750
are all the Guru Tattwa where all the great Gurus

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.410
from Adi Nath, Mohamed Sahib

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.310
and others up to, we can say, Shirdi Sai Nath;

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:32.710
all of them are the Guru principle which we worshipped last time

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:39.243
when we were in Andorra.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.510
So how they are all related with each other,

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.870
how they have worked out together

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:51.600
and brought you to the state of this witness is very important.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.970
Now your Vishuddhi chakra has to be improved.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.810
First of all, this feeling guilty business

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.330
was so much yesterday that, I tell you,

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.510
it was impossible to pull it out.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.710
There's nothing to feel guilty, it's a fashion,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:09.750
just a fashion, "I'm sorry" morning till evening "I'm sorry,

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.050
I'm sorry," What are you sorry for, for being a human being

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.970
or for a Sahaja Yogi?

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:20.550
So one has to be very pleasant towards oneself also.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.310
All the time, "I'm sorry, I should not have done this,

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.110
I should not have done that", all the time feeling sorry

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.410
and feeling guilty spoils your left Vishuddhi.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.290
As your left Vishuddhi is spoilt

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:35.050
what happens is that your Shri Krishna Tattwa is gone.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.200
Then you cannot feel the collective,

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.280
then you cannot understand what has gone wrong with you.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.920
So just if you have to say sorry also, say sorry to God

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.320
and after that don't say sorry anymore.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.320
You face it.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.520
Whatever you have done wrong, all right face it!

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.160
This was wrong, all right it will not be done.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.720
Do not argue with it, do not continue with it,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.480
just face it and say, "This was wrong, and this wrong

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.720
I will not do again." And it's finished.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.310
For you are after all saints now.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.550
You have become now walis, you have become now realized souls,

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.650
you have become now atmajas.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.370
You have got Brahmachaitanya,

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.730
you have seen on your heads there was light,

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.450
you have seen the proof of it.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.570
So I don't have to give you a second certificate.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.730
Only thing, you better understand and be aware

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.210
of your own position. As Shri Krishna has said,

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.250
"You have to be aware of your Self."

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.130
First to get self-realization

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.750
and then to be aware of your position.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:43.870
Then you'll be surprised how you develop proper

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:50.740
attention, and proper understanding.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.460
  Absolutely it is a easy thing to do

00:35:53.660 --> 00:36:01.700
as soon as you find that you have achieved that witness state.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:09.170
So please try to make yourself a witness.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.640
When you see something, go into thoughtless awareness

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.480
that is your fort. Don't think.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.880
See the beauty that is there, just pouring in.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.880
Just watch

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.160
how these trees are standing still just watching you all.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.160
See absolutely still, nothing is moving,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.370
they don't allow even one leaf to move.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.010
Let it be till the breeze starts.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.530
Mother starts the breeze.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.730
Till we'll just keep quiet and watch.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.810
Like these mountains how they are steadily watching everything

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.970
and emitting joy and beauty.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:48.970
In the same way, we have to become a witness.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.720
We need not talk too much, we need not keep quiet

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.560
but in the center we should witness

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.880
the whole thing as Leela.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.510
That's why He is called as Leeladhara,

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:04.110
means the one who sustains the Leela of a person.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.990
It doesn't make you mad, it doesn't make you funny,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.550
but it makes you joyous.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.750
Anything that makes you joyous

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.970
is the Vishnu principle of Shri Krishna.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.790
I hope all of us are going to enjoy

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.270
our Vishnu principle hereafter

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.950
as we have enjoyed before by meditating.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:28.670
Because when we meditate we go into thoughtless awareness.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.940
When we are in thoughtless awareness,

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.060
then only we grow, otherwise we cannot grow.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.260
Whatever we may try we cannot grow.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.360
Unless and until we meditate

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.080
we cannot become thoughtlessly aware.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.800
All those who also want to gain in any walk of life,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.530
in any dimension, those who want to become say,

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:53.790
great artists, great scientists, great anything,

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.910
in Sahaja Yoga is important you must meditate,

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.790
otherwise the Kundalini will come down

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.670
and you lose all your talents.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.450
That's a fact, which has to be told,

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.250
and you have seen how people got transformed.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.970
But sometimes it can be very temporary

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.520
and it may go down

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.440
if people do not take to it in the proper way.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.760
I wish you all very great luck for your witness state.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.120
In the witness state,

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:27.630
we do not anyway express ourselves in a funny manner

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:32.950
but just in looking at ourselves.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.730
Because only we have created all the problems

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.222
and it is we only, detaching ourselves from ourselves,

00:38:41.422 --> 00:38:44.790
can see these problems and can solve them.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.960
By God's Grace, as I know, you all are going to grow very much,

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.560
and this state is to be achieved.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.454
In every state whether it is a blessing,

00:38:56.654 --> 00:38:59.840
whether it is a progress or whether it is just turmoil,

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.560
you have to be seaworthy.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.148
Any ship which is a seaworthy is the one

00:39:04.348 --> 00:39:09.200
which can face all kinds of beautiful voyages

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.800
or even turmoil and even the tempest.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.038
May God bless you.
