1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,280
First, I will speak in Hindi language and then in English.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,160
We are such a cosmopolitan people

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,920
that I don’t know what language to take to.

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,440
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi till 21:39 ]

5
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:46,213
Today we are going to worship Shri Shiva.

6
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:51,259
In the form of Shri Shiva,

7
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,084
we have Shri Sadashiva himself,

8
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,129
and his reflection, Shri Shiva.

9
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,417
This Shiva's form in our heart

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,380
always

11
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:34,220
is sitting there in the form of the Spirit.

12
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:38,820
I'm not saying it's enlightened there.

13
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,457
When the Kundalini is awakened,

14
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:50,985
this Shiva's form gets enlightened.

15
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:58,104
And it gets enlightened in our nerves.

16
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,610
It's said about Chaitanya that it sits on fat.

17
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:04,482
First and foremost,

18
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:12,300
its light comes to our brain.

19
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:18,919
For the first time,

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,050
our heart and

21
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:29,217
our brain

22
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:32,362
become integrated (unite).

23
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:36,679
Otherwise, normally

24
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:40,083
man's intelligence runs on one side

25
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:44,870
and his emotions run on the other side.

26
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:52,891
Due to this union,

27
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:59,048
the light which inside us

28
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:03,143
spreads from the Spirit,

29
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:08,987
that light takes the form of vibrations and appears on our hands and

30
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:14,286
on our fontanelle bone area.

31
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:18,580
All of you know this.

32
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,585
But, you should know that

33
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:28,483
when this light comes into us,

34
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:34,128
we see that gradually our life changes.

35
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:39,586
All anger

36
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:45,726
and six enemies within us are finished.

37
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:49,794
Gradually everything drops out

38
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:54,306
and faith establishes in the mind.

39
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:59,875
From faith, wisdom gets awakened.

40
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:04,387
Nothing will remain important.

41
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:13,206
The personality of Shiva that we have seen

42
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:21,585
is that of an angel,

43
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:27,887
that of a great saint.

44
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:31,020
He is like that.

45
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,131
He doesn't care about anything.

46
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:41,099
His hair are not properly done.

47
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,091
Nothing.

48
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:50,634
What he is wearing, what should be done, he doesn't think about it.

49
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:57,771
He has given all this work to

50
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,044
Vishnu.

51
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:08,765
He wears tiger skin and roams around.

52
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:16,399
And his vehicle is Nandi, who

53
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,992
doesn't come under control in any way.

54
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,402
It's not like horse that you can control.

55
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:26,994
Wherever Nandi goes Shiva goes with it.

56
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:34,253
He never thinks that what people will say.

57
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,627
What will others think.

58
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:43,473
If I dress like this and sit on Nandi, what will people say?

59
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:50,311
Because he is contented within himself.

60
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,693
He is sitting there with his own joy and happiness.

61
00:05:54,894 --> 00:06:00,916
He doesn't care about anything in this world that

62
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:04,599
"what will people say?".

63
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:07,893
He is not ashamed.

64
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:12,522
You must have heard about his wedding.

65
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:17,764
When he came for wedding,

66
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:23,033
when Shri Vishnu saw him

67
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:27,051
he said "who is this funny groom?

68
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,878
How my sister is marrying him?"

69
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:33,871
But Shri Parvati knew that

70
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:39,602
her consort would be this, a happy-go-lucky person.

71
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,883
He doesn't care about anything.

72
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:45,008
When a person goes higher than everything,

73
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,976
for him everything becomes unimportant.

74
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:58,030
His attention won't go in this direction.

75
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:02,020
This Shiva's incarnation that we see,

76
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,768
looks very dear and beloved to us.

77
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,803
And everyone thinks that all this done by Shri Shiva

78
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:16,468
is very special.

79
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:22,832
But, when Shiva's light comes into sahaja yogis,

80
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:28,076
their life start changing too.

81
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,658
I have seen that

82
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:38,173
before they come to Sahaja Yoga,

83
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:44,442
women, men also, liked good clothes very much.

84
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:50,719
All their attention used to go on what to wear.

85
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,649
And these days it's in fashion,

86
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:59,619
because everywhere beauty clinics have opened,

87
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,431
and women are badly stuck in these things.

88
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:10,993
But when the beauty comes from the light inside you,

89
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:15,501
then all these mundane things have no meaning.

90
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:19,670
In the same way, comfort also,

91
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:25,303
in a way, people look for the comfort of the spirit.

92
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:31,078
They don't look for their personal comfort.

93
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,568
See these foreigners.

94
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,648
They live in big houses. They have cars and everything.

95
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,182
But, they come here and just immerse in this atmosphere.

96
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:46,312
But Indians are not like this.

97
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:53,363
Wherever Indians go, they need attached bathroom,

98
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,847
and all kinds of comforts.

99
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,058
Till now they are not able to get over it.

100
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:06,350
I'm astonished that in our poor nation they still have such desires.

101
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,451
It's very astonishing.

102
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:13,751
People told me Mother please buy a large land for ashram.

103
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,566
Our Indians never live in an ashram.

104
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:22,506
This ashram that we have made with so much of effort,

105
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,976
nobody is ready to live in it.

106
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:29,909
I said I will give you salary for staying, they said no.

107
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,769
My birth place in Chhindwara,

108
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,388
we spent so much for that house.

109
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,267
I said those who have retired can stay there,

110
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:44,923
it has very good climate, it's a hill station. No one was ready.

111
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:48,568
Everybody thinks of their own comfort.

112
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:56,375
It's not so with these people. They live very happily in ashram.

113
00:09:57,716 --> 00:10:02,200
My house, my place, my wife,

114
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:07,217
food has to be cooked like this, we will eat this style.

115
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:10,956
We are entangled in taste.

116
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,422
They are not like this.

117
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:16,751
They eat Indian food with interest.

118
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:19,956
But I know when Indians come to Cabella,

119
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:26,010
they will bring Indian breads, pickles, etc. with them.

120
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:33,195
Because they can't get over their tongue. They are stuck in taste.

121
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,625
So, until by meditating you don't get rid of these things,

122
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:48,079
you can't go beyond Dharma.

123
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:53,956
There is a small thing to understand that

124
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:57,405
we lack in sacrifice.

125
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:03,161
This time they said Mother has bought a huge land, spent so much,

126
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:07,861
so for puja let's increase the costs.

127
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:13,956
I received so many letters asking me to decrease puja money.

128
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:19,688
Amazing! One time this puja is happening in Delhi.

129
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:22,576
For that too so many letters about puja money.

130
00:11:22,777 --> 00:11:25,528
They are ready to eat 'paan' (beetle leaf) and throw it

131
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:27,767
but won't pay puja money.

132
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:33,015
I have never taken money from you, I have done everything on my own.

133
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,737
But asking for such a small thing...

134
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:39,723
See today half of the pandal is empty. Why?

135
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,589
Because they don't want to give money for puja.

136
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,804
They phone and ask me to exempt them from puja money

137
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:50,480
Are you in a small job? No, it's not so.

138
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:55,601
"My husband will pay, I won't pay."

139
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:58,646
I'm amazed.

140
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:03,901
If there were a strict guru,

141
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,736
he would shave your heads,

142
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:13,725
make you wear crimson color cloth and stand upside down on the head.

143
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:18,829
But I don't want this, because it's about being spontaneous.

144
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,141
Everything must come in that spontaneity (sahaj).

145
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,713
In my life I have seen many sacrificing people.

146
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:29,693
But I don't see it nowadays.

147
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,328
I know about my mother,

148
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,973
she would give away her sarees if they increased from six to seven.

149
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:47,012
It's amazing, when they come to Cabella,

150
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,363
they need separate room, separate house,

151
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,770
they want to stay separate. Can't stay with others.

152
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,741
The person who can't stay with others is not a yogi.

153
00:12:57,392 --> 00:13:01,223
He still thinks "I'm special, I must have special arrangement".

154
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:04,169
He can't be a sahaja yogi.

155
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:08,293
He is sahaja yogi by name.

156
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:13,149
The one who is Shiva's disciple must be like Shiva.

157
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:17,178
Wherever you make him sleep, sit, whatever you give him to eat,

158
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,797
he doesn't care.

159
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:24,076
He is not time-bound, no desires. He's like that.

160
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:26,602
We can say he is a sahaja yogi.

161
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:30,500
And Shiva's effect will be on you.

162
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:36,346
People do so many things before achieving this.

163
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:41,621
In any other place you go,

164
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:48,009
they will snatch your money, pull your hair, and what not.

165
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,811
It's not like this in Sahaja Yoga.

166
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,147
But this temperament that we have, we must give it up.

167
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:02,435
We must try to see what things we can give up.

168
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:10,429
Unless this ecstasy comes in you, you can't be Shiva's disciple.

169
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:17,162
Mother has all varieties of disciples, nothing special in it.

170
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:23,234
All types of disciples. Whatever they do, think Mother will forgive.

171
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:28,885
But by forgiving, you will not achieve that state.

172
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:38,481
In forgiving, the most important aspect is to ask Shiva to forgive.

173
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,740
All the time ask for his forgiveness.

174
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:47,376
Because all the time we do a lot of things that we shouldn't do.

175
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:53,349
We have to ask, "Oh Shambho, please forgive us". (Shambho=Shiva)

176
00:14:53,902 --> 00:15:00,686
We make many mistakes. We have many requirements.

177
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:03,179
We want this and that.

178
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,957
As long as there is 'I want' within us,

179
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:11,168
until then you have to keep asking for forgiveness from God.

180
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:15,719
And 'my', 'my house', 'my wife',

181
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,962
this kind of authoritative behaviour that we have in us,

182
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:26,407
unless and until we break this we can't be Shiva's disciples.

183
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:32,103
It's astonishing that these foreigners have achieved so much of it.

184
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:35,168
They had never heard his name.

185
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,757
And we people are still stuck,

186
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,249
and believe in it (his name only).

187
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,479
Being Shiva means:

188
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,768
All these worldly angles in us,

189
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:53,726
whatever hatred is inside us,

190
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,411
whatever hollowness we have in us,

191
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,236
give them up.

192
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:03,787
But people even after coming to Sahaja Yoga can't see themselves.

193
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,497
I heard a mother-in-law is torturing her daughter-in-law.

194
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,844
I asked her why she did it. She said "I have not tortured at all".

195
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,714
Amazing!

196
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,389
When they go to cinema and see this kind of torturing they cry.

197
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,970
But when they come home they torture the daughter-in-law.

198
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:25,515
Or the daughter-in-law tortures her mother-in-law.

199
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:29,573
But they will say they have never tortured anyone.

200
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:36,071
By keeping such lies inside you, you can't progress in Sahaja Yoga.

201
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:40,490
Because this changes your life.

202
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,544
It is your gold.

203
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:48,016
And gold can't be tarnished.

204
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,944
Nothing can color it.

205
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:54,692
You have achieved that. Keep that state.

206
00:16:54,893 --> 00:17:01,689
Why to behave like slaves of worldly things now?

207
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,743
This is the specialty of kundalini, that she cleans you completely.

208
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:13,766
You should also serve others.

209
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,613
But I don't need your service as such.

210
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:20,205
I'm satisfied; what service can you give me?

211
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,787
You should bring that satisfaction and joyfulness in you.

212
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:30,673
You should think that everything is for enjoying.

213
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:37,060
And if we're enjoying without doing anything, then what's the worry?

214
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:44,210
After thinking a lot, I have come to this conclusion that

215
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:49,010
Sahaja is very .........

216
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:52,702
And that's why it's so difficult.

217
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:59,918
If someone takes a stick in hand and tells you to shave your hair,

218
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,770
wear ........, fast for 14 days,

219
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:08,435
things will be all done.

220
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,061
But Sahaja should be accepted from the heart

221
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:18,320
and the mind,

222
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:23,198
and correct oneself.

223
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:28,980
"Why I'm acting this? Should I behave like this?"

224
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,664
Many things will drop out by this.

225
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,232
And in a way, you will find yourself.

226
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:39,374
You are self-sufficient and you don't bother about anything,

227
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:43,886
You don't desire anything. Sitting relaxed!

228
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:47,150
And the surprising part is that

229
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:53,666
when Chaitanya knows you don't need anything,

230
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,229
it will give you everything.

231
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,012
It may be for testing you, may be.

232
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:03,957
Then it will see how you react.

233
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:08,892
There is no need that it can't fulfill.

234
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:13,743
But in this a little dedication is needed.

235
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:21,081
Today, we have invoked Shri Shiva.

236
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,316
But, he likes this type of people.

237
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:29,580
The difference between him and me is

238
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:33,538
I like all types of people and he doesn't.

239
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:38,926
He likes the people who have left all these worldly things.

240
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:45,314
These are peculiarities in us.

241
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:49,454
In everything... in wearing clothes...

242
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,795
What will happen if we don't wear like that?

243
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:58,550
But, here we don't believe in asceticism.

244
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:01,957
You will become an ascetic from within.

245
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:09,404
When you are ascetic you become desireless and full of joy.

246
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:14,499
Earlier there were Nath (=saint) people.

247
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:18,393
They used to travel around the world.

248
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:22,155
They gave a lot of teachings to the world.

249
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:27,104
I was astonished to know where they had traveled to.

250
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:33,311
When I went to Colombia, I came to know they had been to Bolivia.

251
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:39,731
If you go to Colombia, in airplane you'll feel dizzy; it's so high.

252
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:43,085
But in those days they used to go on foot.

253
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:48,267
How did they reach there? I don't understand.

254
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:53,900
In Russia and other countries around they have traveled.

255
00:20:54,146 --> 00:21:00,913
How they did it, where they stayed, what they wore; nobody knows.

256
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:09,298
Because you get at the state where you become mysteriously powerful.

257
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:14,002
For example, we know Sai Nath of Shirdi.

258
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:18,754
He appears anywhere, he can come any time, he can help any one.

259
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:24,478
People tell me "Mother we have seen him". I tell them "Yes why not?"

260
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:27,433
Such people become immortal.

261
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:32,328
Because what can kill them are finished, they become immortal.

262
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:38,812
Achieving that immortality, is the actual worship of Lord Shiva.

263
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,680
I am talking to them about Shiva’s worship -

264
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
what should happen to you.

265
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,560
But today, I am going to tell you about

266
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
the internal happening within us

267
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,440
when you get your Realization.

268
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,760
There are eleven rudras placed here – eleven of them.

269
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,240
They are particles, we can say, anshas they call it,

270
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,439
of Shiva’s powers.

271
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,600
And all of them try to take out

272
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,600
or to remove all the false ideas we have about life.

273
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,760
When the Kundalini rises, they all get enlightened - eleven of them.

274
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,080
And, say for example,

275
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,040
Buddha had a part of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

276
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,240
Now, all of them, what they do is to control us

277
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,160
from falling into the prey of various things.

278
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,080
Like, we have an ego.

279
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,760
So, Buddha will look after the ego part.

280
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,360
He will see that you get shocked by your ego.

281
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,000
You will be quite amazed

282
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,320
how you could be so egoistical,

283
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,520
and so insulting, and so humiliating.

284
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,560
But when this rudra is not awakened,

285
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,439
when there is no light in this rudra, then what happens?

286
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,680
You start justifying yourself.

287
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,080
You think whatever you do is correct,

288
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,800
whatever you’ve done, whatever you’ve said,

289
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,320
whatever you have achieved,

290
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,520
you think is your right.

291
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,800
You’ve done nothing wrong.

292
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,040
For that, this Buddha’s rudra has to be awakened.

293
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,640
On the contrary, if you go on pampering your ego,

294
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,360
if you go on becoming egoistical,

295
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,880
you become absolutely a right-sided personality.

296
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,840
Once you are a right-sided personality,

297
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,720
you know what all the symptoms there are of such a person.

298
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,520
Now, for that if you just watch

299
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,880
and introspect and see for yourself what ego has done to you,

300
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,880
what wrong ideas you had about yourself.

301
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,160
So that’s why Mohammed Saheb has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.”

302
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,360
He didn’t know what else to tell.

303
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Because this ego business can really burst you,

304
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,200
your head completely, and you may land up into so many difficulties.

305
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,120
Ultimately, I have seen people developing this yuppie’s disease

306
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,360
where the conscious mind becomes absolutely useless,

307
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,040
cannot move.

308
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,680
Consciously people cannot move.

309
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Unconsciously they will, but not consciously.

310
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,600
And this disease is so horrible. A person becomes like a reptile.

311
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,960
You have to carry them on your body. They can’t walk on their own.

312
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,400
They can’t sit on their own.

313
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,280
In a very young age this can happen. This is happening in America.

314
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,320
Also, I have seen two, three cases here,

315
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,760
in India, also such a thing happened.

316
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,680
So if you do not try to see your ego and control it,

317
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,920
and feel repentant about it.

318
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,800
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like repentance,

319
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,600
we don’t believe in repentance.

320
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,320
Because we believe that you all have got your Realization,

321
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,440
you are beyond any mistakes. It’s not true.

322
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,680
We have to repent.

323
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
There’s a, in English, there is a word – sorry.

324
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,640
Sorry, for everything they will say sorry.

325
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,880
Even telephone if you pick up, they’ll say, “sorry.”

326
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,240
I say, “Sorry, for what?”

327
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,240
But this sorry itself is very empty.

328
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,760
It has no meaning. It has no depth.

329
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,160
When you say “sorry,” you have to see why you are saying “sorry,”

330
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,000
and what is to be corrected.

331
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,439
This is a very big problem of today’s generation

332
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,960
where people have developed such tremendous ego-

333
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,520
because all our economic growth,

334
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,000
all our industrial developments,

335
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,000
all our big, big organizations,

336
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,840
all of them have given us a way

337
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,320
that we should all develop our ego.

338
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,920
If we don’t develop our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere.

339
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,440
And that’s how we start pampering it,

340
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,640
and then this right-sided problem starts.

341
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,240
Then as a reaction, it goes to the left side.

342
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,560
Actually, in the head it is on the right side.

343
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
Here is the right side ego comes up,

344
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,080
so the left rudra is that of Mahavira.

345
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,000
So people do things, which are sinful,

346
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,720
which are wrong, which are against Shri Ganesha.

347
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,680
Then also there are controlling powers of Mahavira, who controls.

348
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,960
He says, “You will go to hell; this will happen,”

349
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,920
he describes all the hell, all kinds of hell,

350
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,240
that you’ll go to hell and you’ll be burnt alive -

351
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,640
I don’t know, all kinds of things He describes to frighten you.

352
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,280
But that doesn’t help.

353
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,480
So people start getting more onto the left side

354
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,840
and, I should say,

355
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,640
through this rudra, when this rudra gets helpless,

356
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,720
then a tremendous depression comes in.

357
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,600
One feels very depressed. “Oh God.

358
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,840
What a depression I have.  I am so sick.  I am this thing.”

359
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,280
And then you try to frighten others with your depressions.

360
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,080
You show sort of a, what you call, an emotional blackmail you do.

361
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,439
All kinds of things you will do,

362
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,960
and beat your head and do all kinds of things.

363
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Could be through ego, could be through

364
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,360
this left side problem of the left rudra.

365
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,880
These two rudras are very important

366
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,080
because they are directly connected with our

367
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,040
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

368
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,640
So, it’s very important to see

369
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,520
that you don’t fall a prey to these rudras.

370
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,720
These rudras are to be satisfied.

371
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,840
So to be normal, at least look after these two rudras, which are:

372
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,840
one is the one who controls the ego, and another is self-pity.

373
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,720
“I just can’t do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of depression.

374
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,840
All this works out

375
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,840
into, physically also, into very serious problems like cancer.

376
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,600
If the rudras are caught up, you develop cancer.

377
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,400
But all this portion gets swollen up.  It’s called as the medha.

378
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,960
This all portion gets swollen up,

379
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,840
and you can see a cancer patient having a swelling all over.

380
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,040
At least would be here, or maybe there.

381
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,640
Because such a swing in the nature of a person

382
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
that you can’t say

383
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,680
from which rudra they have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

384
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,920
Psychosomatic troubles, all of them, come

385
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,960
because the rudras have become ineffective.

386
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,400
It can be due to the depressive nature

387
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,600
or oppressive nature.

388
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,120
It could be due to many other factors also.

389
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,040
But all these factors are nothing

390
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:17,640
but part and parcel of Shri Shiva’s,

391
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,840
or Sadashiva’s powers.

392
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,320
He is the one who is full of karuna - full of compassion.

393
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,720
He is the ocean of compassion.

394
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,200
If you ask Him forgiveness, He'll forgive.

395
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,160
Whatever you do, instead of feeling guilty if you ask forgiveness,

396
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,280
then He forgives.

397
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,520
But if you think you, whatever you have done is good,

398
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,920
you’ve never tortured anybody, you have never made anybody suffer,

399
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,920
then it knows.

400
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,160
Shiva knows everything, isn’t it?

401
00:30:56,439 --> 00:31:00,080
And, because it knows, it starts giving up.

402
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,240
So there’s a big combination of your willpower

403
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,080
to be there, and the combination of the blessings of Shiva.

404
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,720
When the Shiva blesses you,

405
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,080
your willpower also heightens.

406
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,400
But you must have full willpower

407
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,320
to know that you have

408
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,240
to be of a higher level of personality.

409
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,960
He was not at all a mundane type.

410
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,480
I mean He was…

411
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,320
supposing, ask Shiva to go to some party and all that,

412
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,360
how will He look there?

413
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,360
People will laugh at Him.

414
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,800
When I met some hippies, I said,

415
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,280
“Why are you having this kind of hair?”

416
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,080
So they said, “We want to -” they are all primitive -

417
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,200
so he said, “I want to be primitive.”

418
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,920
I said, “But the brain is modern.

419
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,920
What’s the use of having primitive hair?”

420
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,240
So, deception. Deceiving yourself is not going to help.

421
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,800
Best thing is to face yourself and understand

422
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,760
what wrong you have been doing.

423
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,560
If it works out, I tell you,

424
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,560
so many Sahaja Yogis you are sitting here.

425
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,200
If you correct yourself and become that

426
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:22,040
I am sure all the problems - political, economic,

427
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,080
and all stupid problems we have - will be finished.

428
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,439
But today it’s such a mixture, due to Kali Yuga,

429
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,600
that even the worst people are carrying on.

430
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,040
Now, we have a responsibility to save this world.

431
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,200
We have a responsibility to create a great, honorable life,

432
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:50,560
which is not superficial, which is not just to show off.

433
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,360
But inside it should develop

434
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,560
so that this light of your spirit spreads

435
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,240
and enlightens this world.

436
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,680
It’s very important to understand

437
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560
all these troubles and these,

438
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,560
I should say, diseases, psychosomatic diseases,

439
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,080
and all other problems which are,in a collective way we can call,

440
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,200
of the Kali Yuga like political, economic, all these problems -

441
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,160
only are created by human beings.

442
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,400
They're not created by the Divine Force.

443
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,840
But Divine Force tries to neutralize them

444
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,439
if there are many Sahaja Yogis

445
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,840
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word.

446
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,360
If that could be done, if that could be achieved,

447
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,120
then I think we can do a lot,

448
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,439
a lot for the betterment of humanity,

449
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,800
and that’s why we have got realization.

450
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,080
It’s not only for yourself, it’s not only for your family,

451
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
it’s not only for your city or country,

452
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,000
but for the whole world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

453
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Now, if you have to do competition,

454
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,360
you must only do competition in your ascent and in nothing else.

455
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,920
But people are so superficial

456
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,800
that they think by showing off

457
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,439
or by becoming something – a big Johnny -

458
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,840
they will achieve something of a very great level, is not so.

459
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,320
It has to be a very humble attitude towards yourself also,

460
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,320
so that you understand that whatever you are doing

461
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,200
is for the betterment

462
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:50,200
of global problems.

463
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,160
Absolutely we can solve because you are the channels of the Divine.

464
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,360
If I could do it alone, I would have done it.

465
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,880
But I can’t, so that’s why I had to gather you all

466
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,120
and to tell you that you become all the channels.

467
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,720
But in the meanwhile, you enjoy.

468
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,360
You enjoy life. Every second becomes a joy,

469
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,600
which is also the gift of Shiva.

470
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Shiva is the one who creates this

471
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,960
great admiration

472
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,400
and great appreciation of every moment,

473
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,680
everything that is there.

474
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,000
And that is the state we have to achieve,

475
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,360
by not condemning yourself,

476
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,560
or not by pampering your ego,

477
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,560
but by seeing what you are.

478
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,920
That’s the main thing one has to see, is what problem you have,

479
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,240
and what is troubling you is yourself only.

480
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,160
If you could just come to that point of understanding,

481
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,800
I am sure, I am very, very sure

482
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,520
that you will be such an asset

483
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,800
to help to make this world look at itself and change.

484
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,280
Because superficially you cannot change such deep-rooted problems.

485
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,720
And, you are being so blessed by Kundalini

486
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,800
that you can really become a great

487
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,960
torch, I should say,

488
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,080
torch on the path of truth, love and joy.

489
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,520
May God bless you.

490
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
Today first we'll have a short puja of

491
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,720
Shri Ganesh

492
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,120
and then of Shiva

493
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,640
And lastly of the Goddess.

494
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,760
We have little bit changed the sequence.
