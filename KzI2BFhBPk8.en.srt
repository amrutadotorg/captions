EnTC 2019-0417

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,680
Now the thing is our work is spreading very fast

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,190
and people are taking to it.

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,950
In Europe I find the land is much more fertile, surprisingly

5
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,190
and once people get realization, they become fantastic,

6
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,469
I mean they think it’s something that they have been expecting

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,350
and they understand Sahaj Yoga much better than we understand here.

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,710
Though your Kundalinis rise very high, I’ve seen that,

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,830
but the progress is not that all right.

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,950
Now Ray has been to India, he’ll tell you how, what sort of people we have

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,270
in India and how they have progressed themselves.

12
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,590
Now as I said the main problem of our country is lethargy

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,870
and lethargy is something we have to overcome somehow

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,030
and this lethargy is a, actually a satanic force.

15
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,670
It’s not lethargy only of the matter

16
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,110
that comes from material domination on the Spirit,

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:33,350
but it is really satanic because it stops your progress and is to be avoided.

18
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,110
And to get out of it one has to be really

19
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,710
alert about it, how it crawls onto you.

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,030
Krishna has put, the worst vice in the whole world is “aalasya”,

21
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,670
means lethargy. “Aalasyso Bijayate” – everything comes out of aalasya.

22
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,030
According to Him, first the lethargy comes in

23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,950
and because of lethargy we get into vices

24
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,030
and then we go to the right side also because of lethargy.

25
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,710
Because just to avoid the lethargy we go to the right side too much.

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,350
So according to Him everything starts with lethargy

27
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,950
and then the person loses the essence of life through lethargy

28
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,590
and this is our special quality

29
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,190
and that is our real problem – is the lethargy.

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,950
Because Sahaj Yoga is a thing where we say there is “akriya”.

31
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,350
We don’t have to do anything. It is effortless.

32
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,470
Everything works out effortless, spontaneously.

33
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,590
So we think that everything is going to work out for us spontaneously.

34
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,950
Only the Kundalini Jagruti is spontaneous for the first time,

35
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,830
not for the second time, only for the first time.

36
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,750
That is I have to do it or My photograph has to do it.

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,390
But afterwards you have to work, you have to keep your Kundalini afloat.

38
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,950
You have to understand what are your problems,

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,190
what are you getting into.

40
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,230
I mean, individually every one of you is a masterpiece, individually.

41
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,830
Because of lethargy you are clouded.

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:30,390
Secondly because of lethargy you are secluded, lethargy gives you also ego.

43
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,950
Because anything that challenges lethargy

44
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,230
you get on top of that person, you don’t like such a person.

45
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,030
But the lethargy also those do not have

46
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,350
are the people their attention is not on spiritual development.

47
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,150
Theirs is as I told you yesterday, on other things,

48
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,950
which are not important to spiritual life.

49
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,670
We pay so much attention to other things than to our spiritual life.

50
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,710
Why is it? Why is it we pay more attention to material things,

51
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,350
to material comforts, to material achievements, to material obsessions?

52
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,230
Why? You must think about it.

53
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,950
And why not to our spiritual ascent?

54
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,950
The reason is we have been identified with matter.

55
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,350
We have been going through that circle.

56
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,230
We thought that we must have material development,

57
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,750
so we had industrial revolution,

58
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,190
we created a society dominated by industries, machinery came up.

59
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,110
We saw the machinery started dominating us.

60
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,830
We wanted to misidentify from that machinery.

61
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,390
Machinery has also given us lethargy

62
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,910
because we use machine made things our hands do not work.

63
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,030
We have lost all the deftness of the hands;

64
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,350
we have lost all the walking capacity.

65
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,270
We can only take a bus or a car; we do not want to walk at all.

66
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,630
Now this mechanization and the use of matter too much,

67
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,870
has made us sort of matters ourself.

68
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,830
We have become matter that we cannot live without it,

69
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,950
yet we are so identified with it.

70
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,670
After realization if you are still identified with the matter,

71
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,270
then your realization slows down.

72
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,430
So to, one has to understand, one has to understand fully

73
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:38,030
that matter is absolutely secondary.

74
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,350
Without of course getting your body you cannot receive realization,

75
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,390
you have to have your body.

76
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,590
But matter which is gross, is of no meaning.

77
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,830
Subtle matter is all right for us, that’s important.

78
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,950
Like this light, which is burning, is important.

79
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,950
Water that is in the ocean is all right.

80
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,150
The sky, open sky – say here it is not so good

81
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,030
but if you go to a country is even better.

82
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,910
The Mother Earth say example here, I don’t know how it is,

83
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,950
but in India certain places Mother Earth is very much subtle,

84
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,030
your material identifications.

85
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,630
So matter has been identified with us, we have been using it, living with it

86
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,950
and that’s why it is easy for us to get back into the same circle of matter.

87
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,295
And we get into it, we pay attention more to it.

88
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:40,130
Your attention if it is dominated by matter, people can make it out.

89
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,890
And that is one thing has to look after very clearly because

90
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,890
these are countries who have advanced so much in material advancement.

91
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,650
So what happens, every matter attracts your attention.

92
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,650
You go on the street there’s this one woman is standing

93
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,370
or there is something selling, this happening. All the time the attention …

94
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,410
You see it is their job to attract your attention,

95
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,810
otherwise how are they going to exploit you?

96
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,050
See, they will have no justification.

97
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,370
So they produce things, advertise things,

98
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,890
to do in such a way to distract your attention.

99
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,330
Now this is a force, which is acting against our attention.

100
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,610
So as far as possible keep your attention straight, or on the Mother Earth.

101
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,450
If you can control your attention, you can overcome your material domination.

102
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,810
Now the best thing is to put attention to your Spirit.

103
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,050
If you start putting your attention to Spirit,

104
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,890
the sweetness of the Spirit itself

105
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,970
will make the whole thing very sweet and beautiful.

106
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,050
The attention should be in the Spirit.

107
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,170
Even you are getting ready; keep the attention on the Spirit.

108
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,330
Now it’s not difficult because Kundalini has reached that stage.

109
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,050
Before realization if I had said it,

110
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,610
then you would have said, “Mother, how to do it?”

111
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,890
But now when you have got realization, try to bring your attention to Spirit.

112
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,050
Means first when the Kundalini rises you start looking at the Spirit

113
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,210
or you say when you get realization you see the Spirit.

114
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,130
In the sense that the Spirit starts flowing through you,

115
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,050
you start watching its flowing in this thing.

116
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,930
But then after some time, you must enter into Spirit

117
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,730
and see through the window of the Spirit, the whole thing

118
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,570
by developing your witness Spirit. If you develop your witness state,

119
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,730
from attention you become knowledge, the truth.

120
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:53,210
Then material things become the knowledge;

121
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,650
aesthetics of matter start giving you joy.

122
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,530
You do not want to possess it, but they start giving you joy

123
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,050
and even if you want to posses it,

124
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,050
it would be just to enjoy it and give it away to somebody else.

125
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,650
It’s like that. It’s for your enjoyment

126
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,970
and you want to give it away to someone else.

127
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,810
When you develop your witness state this will come to you that you will

128
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,650
not keep things to yourself but you would like to give and share, sharing.

129
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,130
That is the time you should know you have become a witness,

130
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,650
because you are enjoying.

131
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,650
Witness state is the state of Shri Krishna, of Virat.

132
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:46,530
When you start sharing your things then it is a proper thing.

133
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:37,810
Now the essence of puja is also how to overcome our material grossness.

134
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:45,810
Puja is nothing but is how to overcome our material grossness.

135
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,370
When we want to have a matter to ourselves,

136
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,650
we must know that it is given to us by God. Everything belongs to God.

137
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,970
Supposing we give flower to God,

138
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,570
after all it is God’s own creation, what are we giving?

139
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,330
We show light to God or do ‘aarti’ to God. What?

140
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,970
It is all God’s light only, what do we do?

141
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,930
But by showing light to God,

142
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,610
what we do is to, we worship light within us.

143
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,890
The light element gets enlightened within us.

144
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:41,130
The light element is here on the Agnya.

145
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,050
When you do aarti, or when you put light before God,

146
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,090
when you show light to God,

147
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,530
the light element within you gets enlightened.

148
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,290
When you give flowers, Mooladhara gets enlightened.

149
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:07,730
When you get honey, then your attention gets enlightened.

150
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,650
So, why we give it to God, after all God doesn’t need anything.

151
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,650
But God is the enjoyer. You are not the enjoyer, you cannot enjoy.

152
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:23,650
Enjoyer is God in you. When God is there that enjoys, that is the Spirit.

153
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:35,290
So whatever pleases your Spirit is used in the puja to be given.

154
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,810
Now you give rice – all these things are discovered –

155
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,650
that you give rice to the Devi. Rice should be put in Her lap.

156
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,410
Now what is rice, a little rice to a Devi?

157
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,850
Is, by putting rice, in you the satisfaction of getting food

158
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,090
or food that gives you satisfaction is enlightened.

159
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,290
But that doesn’t mean you start showering things on Me, that doesn’t mean that.

160
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,810
What I am trying to say, do it with dignity and understanding.

161
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,410
That you give Me rice. Now, rice giving

162
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,090
– these people don’t understand why rice is to be given to God?

163
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,650
After all, why give Him palm leaves? What is He going to do?

164
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:33,530
If Christ was the Son of God. What was the use of putting palm leaves for Him?

165
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:43,090
Or to give Him oil, oil bath or to rub His feet with oil?

166
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,650
It is for you to get the advantage. Now in Sahaj yoga it is proved now.

167
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,090
When you rub My feet, you feel better, not Me.

168
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,650
You rub My hands, you feel better.

169
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,050
When you fall at My feet, you feel better.

170
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,410
She, she is a great – what was, what is, what were you doing?

171
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,210
Lady: Reflexology
Shri Mataji: Reflexology. Big name, ah? Reflexology.

172
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,410
And she is supposed to know about the feet and things like that

173
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,930
One day she said, “Mother I want to come and massage Your feet.

174
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,050
I know this and all that.” So I said, “All right, come along.”

175
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,330
So she came to rub My feet.

176
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,650
Instead of I feeling, becoming relaxed, she was becoming relaxed.

177
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,650
The more she was rubbing she was getting relaxed.

178
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,290
So you see when you do for God, the blessings comes to you.

179
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,930
You are blessed.

180
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,730
Whatever is the problem with you, you give to God to solve.

181
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,450
Also whatever satisfies you, you give to God.

182
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,650
The satisfaction comes to you.

183
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,970
Now, these flowers when you give it to Me, Mooladhara.

184
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,290
They give you two things, Swadishthana and Mooladhara.

185
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,650
Flowers that’s why are very important.

186
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,970
They give Swadishthana, if the flowers are beautiful,

187
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,570
then they give Swadishthana

188
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,210
and if they are fragrant they cure your Mooladhara.

189
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,690
Now, I mean there is no end to flowers also.

190
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:18,330
But think about it, that you are doing it to improve your chakras.

191
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,530
Then other things that are used like say ghee.

192
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:31,611
Ghee is used. It is for Vishuddhi.

193
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,610
Shri Krishna is very fond of ghee and butter.

194
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,130
So when you rub My feet with say butter,

195
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,330
your Vishuddhi will improve, you know that.

196
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,330
Not Mine, I have no problem.

197
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,690
I have only one problem that you are within Me

198
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,930
and when you have problem I have problems.

199
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,730
Because these vibrations have to go to you.

200
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,810
So I prepare vibrations here as an antidote and they have to flow.

201
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,930
It’s a very subtle thing to understand.

202
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,210
To move from gross to Spirit, this is the thing by which you move,

203
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,410
because first you enlighten your chakras.

204
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:18,050
By enlightening your chakras, your deities get happy, prasanna.

205
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,650
By making the deities happy, you keep, get a passage

206
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,650
for the Kundalini to pass through.

207
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,610
By making the passage for the Kundalini, the Kundalini goes up

208
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,090
and then your attention starts becoming one with the Spirit.

209
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,650
It is step by step, you move from matter to subtler matter,

210
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,450
from subtler matter to your chakras,

211
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,530
from chakras to deities,

212
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,930
from deities to the Spirit.

213
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,130
Then Spirit enjoys itself.

214
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,530
So there you do not have to do anything.

215
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,290
Just give your Spirit to Spirit.
