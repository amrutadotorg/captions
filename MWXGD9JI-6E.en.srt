1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:08,230
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It was
a thing of great joy to Me to come to Sheffield

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,160
again. Always this name Sheffield created
a kind of a mystery in My mind. The word Sheffield

3
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:32,759
could be the ‘She Field’ and She is the
Mother energy, the energy within you which

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:40,460
creates this field within you and is in the
Gita. Shri Krishna has talked about the field

5
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:50,190
that we all have a Pradesh - is the field
but Desh means the field and the enlightened

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,480
one is the Pradesh. And that same thing happens
to us when this Kundalini rises within you.

7
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:08,469
This Holy Ghost which is described in the
bible, She is the Kundalini, She is the Mother.

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Actually people don’t know anything about
Holy Ghost and we didn’t give Christ much

9
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,600
chance to speak about it. He could only speak
for three and a half years, is nothing. I

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,600
can tell you three and a half years in this
land anywhere in the whole world it’s so

11
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:39,580
difficult even to convince four people that
they have to seek the truth, it’s very difficult.

12
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,530
Especially in the land where He was born.
It was full of ignorance, complete ignorance.

13
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,530
And in that ignorance to speak about realization,
to speak about second birth, even to speak

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,840
about God was so difficult. And He was just
crucified for nothing at all, today we may

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,670
have big organizations in His name but when
He lived nobody listened to Him and they crucified

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:15,670
Him. He talked about Holy Ghost but this Holy
Ghost had been interpreted by people in various

17
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,840
ways. They’ve never been able to say what
is this Holy Ghost but logically you can come

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,859
to some conclusion yourselves because you’re
all intelligent people.

19
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:35,859
We talk about the Father, all right, and then
the Son. Have you heard of a father producing

20
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:43,349
a son? You have to have the Mother. It’s
the Mother who creates the Son. Now why this

21
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,420
Holy Ghost was kept as a secret, never talked
about it because Christ was afraid – not

22
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,749
afraid but was cautious I should say, because
such people are never afraid of anything.

23
00:02:55,749 --> 00:03:02,749
He was cautious to talk about His Mother because
if they had harmed His Mother by any chance,

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,120
then He had eleven powers of destruction and
the destruction of world would have come much

25
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,209
earlier than today. He had to play the whole
drama of His crucifixion and that’s how

26
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,510
He had to go through all that.

27
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,840
In that process He didn’t want to involve
His Mother. He didn’t want to explain about

28
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,290
Holy Ghost and He knew that it will be later
on explained. But logically we must understand

29
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,829
what is this Holy Ghost we are talking about?
[A dove?] All right, it’s peace. How do

30
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:43,829
you get to the peace? Supposing it is the
symbol of peace. Today we see in the world

31
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:51,139
we see these televisions and we hear, we read
newspapers and we are shattered and so much

32
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,489
of friction, so much of sin. People are not
even worried about what they are doing, to

33
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:06,489
what extent human beings can go you can see
the way a three year-old child was molested,

34
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:15,150
the innocence is attacked like this. Why?
Why human beings cannot control their desires

35
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,380
which are so devilish? Why there is so much
of friction in this world? We have to think

36
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,430
about it and we must also think positively
what we can do about it.

37
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,760
Now at the same time there are so many seekers
of truth born on this earth. This is the special

38
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,540
time and that’s why they are born on this
earth. But they are misled, they go to wrong

39
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,390
people, they get identified with wrong people.

40
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:49,390
When I came here, the person who is organizing
Sahaja Yoga here told Me that, “Mother,

41
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,210
they come, they get their realization and
then they disappear, they start doubting.”

42
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,170
I said, “That’s a good sign, it’s a
healthy sign.”

43
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,540
Let them doubt because the way they jump into
all these horrible things like gurus and this

44
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,790
and that, the way they accept as if they have
no personality, they have no discretion. The

45
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:15,540
way they jump into even drugs I don’t know,
what happens that we have lost all our personality.

46
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:22,540
They took to any fashion, to any nonsense
so easily and to reality with such difficulty.

47
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,620
We have lost our discretion that’s what
it is, but doesn’t matter whatever it is

48
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,620
use your brains. Understand that this world
is not created to be destroyed. You’re not

49
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:42,420
created out of amoeba just to be destroyed
by something nonsensical like drug(s) or some

50
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,070
sort of a guru; nobody has right to destroy
you. They cannot create you and they cannot

51
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,380
destroy you, nor you have any right to destroy
yourself because you cannot create yourself,

52
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:02,380
the one who is your Creator, the one who has
loved you who has so beautifully made this

53
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,120
beautiful human life is responsible. He is
the one who is so earnest about it that you

54
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,520
should get your realization, that you should
get your second birth, that you should be

55
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,740
baptized in the real sense of the word.

56
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I agree religions have shown funny things,
some thing so absurd that one can start doubting

57
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:38,130
their credibility. I admit that, but that
is the mistake of human beings not of the

58
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,940
divine. Divine created beautiful flowers on
the same tree of life time and time again

59
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,110
but when the people plucked these flowers
and said, “These are mine, these are mine.”

60
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:57,110
They became dead and ugly and they are fighting
now in the name of God, in the name of religion.

61
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,830
Imagine, how can you do such merciless, horrible,
brutal things to other human beings but this

62
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,200
must shatter you, this must make you understand
and you should be aware.

63
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,170
Get out of your sleep now and know that you
are the people who are seekers. You have to

64
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:26,990
be more aware, more understanding of your
responsibility. It is no use standing there

65
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,840
with a banner saying we want peace. How? The
peace has to be within. Human beings are not

66
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,450
at peace. You see in the art you see today
the art has left the Divine behind, the art

67
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:47,450
has become so, chaotic. The expression of
esthetics are just missing there’s no beauty

68
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:57,470
in it. You feel the chaotic heart of an artist
being expressed in that what he’s made,

69
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,770
why? Because he has lost himself.

70
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:07,770
Now it is the responsibility of you people
living in these modern times to become that,

71
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:15,450
that source of peace, which is your Spirit,
and the Spirit resides within you. It is all

72
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:23,530
the time there it is the witness of this field
I should say the She Field, the field that

73
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,750
is to be enlightened by this Kundalini that
exists within you but is not enlightened,

74
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,289
it has not come into your attention. The Spirit
has not come into your attention, that’s

75
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,969
why we think this is all talk. There are people
who are so called intellectuals; they say

76
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:47,969
this is all talk, talk, talk. For a mental
conception it is impossible to tell what lies

77
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:56,240
beyond it because mind is a limited thing.
You have to go beyond mind; you have to be

78
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,550
triggered into the space to see that. The
evolution has been just like your spacecraft

79
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:09,550
going into the space. First, the first thing
comes up is the physical being, explodes gets

80
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:17,879
its accelerations then becomes your mental
being, your emotional being, your spiritual

81
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:25,269
being and then it has to go to the space.
That is the time today is the space age. When

82
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:32,230
we talk of the space age you think of the
space, which is beyond this gravity, there

83
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:39,230
is some space, which is beyond all gravities,
beyond all temptations, beyond all slaveries.

84
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,139
We talk of our freedom, where is the freedom
I just don’t think see. Anybody comes now

85
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:49,680
and says all right, have this drug for so
much money. We are finished with it. Anybody

86
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,759
comes and says all right, you take up your
clothes this way, live like this, we just

87
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:01,759
accept without thinking, without understanding.
We have given up the traditions alright whatever

88
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,309
was wrong in the tradition should have been
given no doubt but everything if you give

89
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:14,309
up then remember we are falling down. We are
coming down we are not going up. When you

90
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:20,569
are going up you do not give up the staircase.
Staircase is there and you go up higher and

91
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:27,569
higher. No tradition is so bad is to be discarded
but if it is so it should be discarded but

92
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,449
that is what is the discretion and that discretion
is so much lacking today that people can’t

93
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:42,449
see that what we are doing collectively or
individually is not constructive.

94
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,660
Now I would say that this is not the time
for us just to sit back on the fence and see

95
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,660
which side we fall. Either you will fall into
hell or you’ll go to heaven. This is the

96
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,069
situation, we are so precariously placed,
I do not want to frighten you because there

97
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:10,069
is the Spirit within you just to be enlightened,
it’s your own, it is there, it’s your

98
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:17,329
own property. It’s not Mine, it’s yours,
it’s your own treasure within you. Only

99
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:22,740
this treasure is to be exposed to you. Now
for that how can you pay? First thing you

100
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,509
must know you cannot pay for it. If I say
that then all the gurus are after My life,

101
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,600
they want to kill Me, they want to do all
those things. You cannot take money for God’s

102
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,439
work.

103
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:41,379
We sold Christ, you know that. He didn’t
take any money, did He? We have got such a

104
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:46,269
great personality like Christ and we just
want to discard Him, make fun of Him, say

105
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:52,019
all kinds of things about Him, intellectualize
Him, organize Him. You cannot touch Him. You’re

106
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:57,180
still human beings, you have to be the Spirit
to understand that Great Soul which came on

107
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,309
this earth. In the same way any other soul,
which was an Incarnation who came on this

108
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:09,309
earth, cannot be understood by our normal
understanding, but only a person with that

109
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:17,059
pure intelligence can see this point that
I’m not satisfied with what I am, I have

110
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:18,160
to go beyond.

111
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,160
There’s some transformation needed and how
will this transformation take place? We can’t

112
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,949
do anything about it because we have done
nothing to become human beings did we? What

113
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:38,949
did we do to become human beings? Nothing,
so going beyond also must be built in within

114
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,519
us. The way we became human beings there must
be some built-in process by which we will

115
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,019
become that higher being. Now the problem
at the human level is that somebody has to

116
00:12:54,019 --> 00:13:01,019
talk at human level. Say at the fish level,
one fish had to come up so the others could

117
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:09,180
follow that fish. At human level, some human
being has to tell you about it. That’s how

118
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:16,319
Christ came on this earth. I mean we have
a quite a long traditional history of all

119
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:22,970
these great people came on this earth at different
places, at different times. According to the

120
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:29,970
time they had to talk. When they talked say,
about the flowers, say they talked that they

121
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:38,410
are Gods, like Socrates talked about Gods,
like Confucius talked about Gods. When they

122
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,050
talked we have to please our gods we started
doubting. What god’s he’s talking about?

123
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:51,050
Whatever they saw we could not see, all right.
Then they thought no use talking about gods.

124
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,720
If you talk about gods then it becomes a sort
of a worship of something that is a flower.

125
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,300
We talk about flowers then we think we have
become God and we talk about flower all the

126
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:08,300
time. But we have to get to the honey. How
do we do it? So they said, “All right, don’t

127
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:14,459
talk about God, talk about abstract, talk
about the fragrance, talk about the honey

128
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:21,459
itself.” But how do you become, how do you
get to the honey? By talking about it again

129
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:30,050
it became a talk and talk and talk. So how
it has to happen that you have to become the

130
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,869
bee, the transformation has to take place.

131
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:41,129
First understand this simple point that some
transformation has to take place within us

132
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:48,129
to go or to penetrate into that unknown divine
which we call as collective unconscious. Something

133
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:58,869
has to happen to us that we have to become
subtler beings. Don’t be satisfied and don’t

134
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:05,449
self certify yourself that “I’m all right;
nothing wrong with me.” No, nothing’s

135
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,899
wrong with you. Y0ou’re all right, but you
have still to be connected to the mains. Like

136
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,929
this instrument, if it is not connected to
the mains it won’t work. It is as simple

137
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:23,929
as this instrument that you are to be connected
with the mains and for that you have got built-in

138
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,490
process that has to work out.

139
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,540
It’s nice we have instruments in these modern
times that I can use them as an analogies

140
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,540
to explain to you. For others they had to
use the analogies of the seed that how we

141
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,170
imbed the seed in the Mother Earth and the
Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout the

142
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:53,019
seed and the seed has the built-in map of
all the trees it is going to create. Now if

143
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:58,759
you look at the seed do you see the miracle
behind the little seed there? In India we

144
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:04,540
have huge big banyan trees and if you see
the seed is so small that it’s quite microscopic

145
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,480
and it makes huge big banyan trees. How does
it make? We never wonder. Whatever is the

146
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,139
wonder, the mystery of this creation we never
wonder about it, we never look at it, look

147
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:22,809
at ourselves, what are we? We are human beings,
these eyes, can we make eyes like this.

148
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:27,540
We are making computers, but look at this
brain the computer that is within, we don’t

149
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,379
have to program it nothing it just knows.
You know I’m sitting here, I know you’re

150
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:38,379
sitting here just looking at it. You don’t
have to go through the process of finding

151
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:44,309
out what is the process of it and then it
moves the whole thing and gives you the program

152
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:50,869
and out of the program something comes out.
It is there just at the same instant you know

153
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:57,869
what is it. This kind of a computer is made
for us, why? To be wasted, to be confused,

154
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:08,029
to be ended up in a lunatic asylum? We must
have the proper value system about ourselves.

155
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,689
First of all we are human beings made from
amoeba to this stage in thousands of years

156
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,630
with great care and delicacy, for what purpose
we must ask the question, why are we made?

157
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:27,579
Are we made here just to ruin ourselves or
not to do anything just like blind people

158
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:34,579
going about hitting here hitting there. No,
we are made to become the Spirit and the whole

159
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:42,390
system is built-in within you. And we have
to go into another realm of our awareness

160
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:49,529
into a new dimension. Now these dimensions
can be also misinterpreted. It’s such a

161
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:55,399
dangerous line we are into because these modern
times are full of horrible people.

162
00:17:55,399 --> 00:18:01,850
Like somebody says that “All right, I can
hear voices." So what?

163
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,330
"I can see light." So what?

164
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:12,330
Or somebody says that, "All right, I feel
like I’m flying in the air, I leave my body."

165
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:13,240
So what?

166
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,240
What have you got? You are under the control
of something else, you don’t know anything.

167
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,190
Logically you must know what you are doing,
what’s happening to you, what is within

168
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:33,190
you, you must know each and everything. You
have to know that if I have become the light

169
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:39,390
then I must have the power of the light, I
don’t see the light. If I see the light

170
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:46,390
I’m not the light. If I become the light,
then I have the power of light. In the light

171
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:55,090
you see clearly and that is what you get is
collective consciousness. You can feel another

172
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,960
person’s Chakras, you can feel your centers
and if you know how to cure that, how to improve

173
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,149
that and how to raise the Kundalini which
is a very, very simple thing - because it

174
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,130
is so fundamental that’s why it is so simple.

175
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:20,130
You can cure yourself, you can cure others
and you can live very joyously within yourself.

176
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:30,100
This is what you have to have and that’s
how you will realize that we are part and

177
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,600
parcel of the whole. The microcosm becomes
one with the macrocosm. Not by talking about

178
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:45,690
it by saying about it by mental projections
no, it happens to you, it really happens to

179
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,230
you when you become the spirit, it works on
your central nervous system, you know what

180
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:05,120
you are and what others are. That they’re
part and parcel of you is known to you on

181
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,860
your central nervous system.

182
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:17,389
So we come to conclusion that if we have to
become the Spirit what should we do? Nothing.

183
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:24,389
What do we do when we put the seed in the
Mother Earth? Nothing, but once you become

184
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:31,980
that then you have to look after it. When
the seed is sprouted, comes out of the Mother

185
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,950
Earth then we have to look after it, and that’s
the point where most of the western people

186
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:45,950
fail. The reason is this knowledge is not
known to them. Their knowledge is like the

187
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:53,950
tree, which is exposed outside. They don’t
have the knowledge of the roots. This is the

188
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:00,480
knowledge of the roots and we have to give
and take. We have to talk about it; we have

189
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,480
to understand that there’s nothing like
India and England two different things. England

190
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:14,519
I call it the heart of the universe, it is,
and India is the Kundalini of the universe.

191
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:22,980
The Kundalini has to know England and England
has to know the Kundalini. If it is one whole

192
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,559
body then one part has to know another part.

193
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:38,559
So all your misconceptions, or conceptions,
or maybe right ideas are all become absolutely

194
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:51,139
evident, vividly seen because you get the
light of your own Spirit. That Spirit is missing.

195
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,419
That Spirit which is all the time watching
you, witnessing you has to be enlightened

196
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:06,419
in the sense that the Spirit must enlighten
your attention. That’s how you become the

197
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,840
attention and wherever you put the attention
you act. It’s very surprising, like if you’re

198
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,320
watching the television, watching the television,
it’s unreal and you’re looking at the

199
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:28,350
television. They cannot act on you and you
cannot act on them because it is artificial.

200
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:35,289
But supposing there’s a gentleman sitting.
He’s a living body not artificial you are

201
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:41,120
talking to that person and that person is
talking to you it acts. But this attention

202
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,889
which is a subtler being within you - your
attention - supposing you project it to someone

203
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:53,909
and it acts for the benevolence, never for
destruction but for the benevolence. When

204
00:22:53,909 --> 00:23:00,909
it acts for the benevolence you are amazed,
how does it happen? How can my attention have

205
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:08,049
the power of benevolence? Because in your
attention is now the light of the Spirit.

206
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:12,549
So you become benevolent.

207
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:19,549
You know the truth whether it is true or not.
How will you know? I was once in Pune and

208
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:29,570
you see in England they say I’m preaching,
I’m preaching about Hinduism, I’m converting

209
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,919
everybody to Hindus. And in India they say
I’m converting them to Christianity - because

210
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,159
I’m doing both you see, [laughter from Shri
Mataji and from the audience] So they have

211
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,720
a great objection about Me everywhere because
they don’t see the integrated work about

212
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,659
Sahaja Yoga, all right?

213
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:53,659
So they said that “This is wrong, whatever
She’s saying is not correct because we are

214
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,399
Brahmins and we know about our shastras and
we are Brahmins.”

215
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:02,509
But they didn’t tell Me all this. They talked
all these things to others and they said,

216
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,649
“We can’t have Her in our hall, She’s
not a Brahmin and She’s in a Christian family

217
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:09,899
we can’t have Her.”

218
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:14,909
So the Brahmins, as usual all priests as they’re
always against the truth you see they were

219
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:20,059
against the truth there also as Brahmins.
I didn’t know all these things but suddenly

220
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:25,259
I felt and I said, "Whosoever are Brahmins
among you please come forward."

221
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:31,090
So four five you see very hefty people came
and sat in front like this. I said," Really

222
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,070
are you Brahmins?"

223
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,049
“Yes” they said.

224
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:36,009
“All right, all put your hands towards Me,
like this.”

225
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:40,799
They put their hands like this towards Me
and what happened that they start shaking

226
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,200
like this.

227
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,860
I said, “What’s happening? Stop it, why
are shaking?

228
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,690
He said to the others who are there they are
also shaking. I said yes but ask them from

229
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,509
where they come. They said we are certified
lunatics coming from a lunatic asylum [audience

230
00:24:54,509 --> 00:25:01,039
laughs] because Mother has cured some lunatics
so we are sitting here. Then they realized

231
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,529
that they were also quite lunatic [audience
laughs again] because they’re fundamentalists.

232
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:11,500
If you go to extremes you become lunatic,
I mean lunatics at least can be put in the

233
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,860
lunatic asylum but these people are going
around everywhere, you don’t know how to

234
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,620
control them, all over the world they are
creating such problems every, every country

235
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,639
has them. Somewhere they are very sophisticated
so you can’t make them out somewhere they

236
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:31,600
are very closed so you know they are there
but some are can be very subtle you can’t

237
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,740
make them out but you cannot make them budge
from whatever they are holding onto.

238
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:43,740
So this is how relatively first you realize
what is the Truth. With these vibrations,

239
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:51,110
with the vibrations that flow that you feel
when the Kundalini crosses through your Brahmarandra

240
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,309
as they call it, we can call the fontanel
bone area you start feeling the cool breeze

241
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:04,259
of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.
Then also you start feeling sometimes little

242
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,080
late in your fingers the cool breeze coming
in.

243
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,110
Now some people are very proud, "Oh, I’m
not feeling anything."

244
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:17,279
That’s not a good thing; if you’re not
feeling there’s something wrong. Somewhere

245
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:23,820
something missing, normally you should. Children
feel it very fast because they’re so innocent,

246
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:30,820
not yet spoiled by anything. They are not
so egoistical; they do not have these barriers.

247
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,679
Some sort of problem is there that you’re
not feeling the cool breeze. You should because

248
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,259
this is the All Pervading Power of God which
surrounds us, is everywhere and every one

249
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,019
of you should feel that cool breeze.

250
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:50,779
Once you start feeling the cool breeze then
you become the joy because first of course

251
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:55,419
you want to try with everything. "Is it cool
breeze? Is it cool breeze? That is cool breeze.

252
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:59,740
Should I go or not? Let me see now, if it
is cool breeze I’ll go otherwise."

253
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:06,740
You go on like that. Then you realize this
is the truth, this is the truth, and then

254
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:17,630
the joy of finding the truth emerges. But
in India it’s just the other way round.

255
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,879
They’re not bothered because they know what
happens. They know; they have the knowledge

256
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:29,289
of the roots, so they know what is to be found
out. We don’t have to go very far, even,

257
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,659
so near, I mean, few years back we should
say was, we had Nanaka, we had Kabira. They

258
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:42,659
talked about it very clearly they told about
this so vividly that anybody with any sense

259
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:50,159
should understand. Especially Kabira who was
such a great poet and such a great incarnation,

260
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:59,629
I would say the way he talked right from all
these Brahmins to all the hypocrites and everything

261
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:09,379
he gave them left and right. He was like Saint
Michael with a sword in his hand cutting everybody.

262
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,139
Like your William Blake, he was really like
your William Blake who gave left and right

263
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:22,139
to all these nonsensical people. He has talked
about it, he very clearly describing Sahaj.

264
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,450
He said, Nanaka has said (???) you can only
get Samadhi through Sahaja.

265
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,159
Sahaja means spontaneous, only spontaneously
can you get it. Then you have got Kabira who

266
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:40,159
was treated like a (shidule?) caste. Like
a (shidule?) caste he was treated. Nobody

267
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,090
respected him. Then we had Ramdas another
one a great man I’m told, there is a temple

268
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:55,070
of this Ramdas. I was so amazed that in England
it should come and prosper. They were treated

269
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,090
just like (shidule?) caste by these people
nobody would listen to them. Nobody would

270
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,820
allow them to come in a temple, these great
saints, because they were not be a born in

271
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:12,820
a Brahmin family; and these great people have
talked, Nanaka has talked very clearly, very

272
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:20,029
recently they have talked about these things.
Hundred years back only. William Blake has

273
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:27,029
talked about Sahaja Yoga. He has said, "The
men of God, men of God" - that’s you - "will

274
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,580
become prophets and they will have powers
to make others prophet." He had such hopes

275
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,580
of making England into Jerusalem, but where
are those English? I have still to meet many.

276
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,980
I’ve worked in this country for twelve years,
relentlessly. India I’ve worked very little

277
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:53,980
but we have thousand fold people who have
got realization in India. They may be poor

278
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:03,750
but they know what they have to get, to them
to get to their self realization is the thing.

279
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:09,649
Nothing else matters, they do not intellectualize,
they know already this is it, this is it.

280
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:16,649
Everyone knows, right from President downward
everyone knows what to expect, but whatever

281
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:25,649
is our knowledge has been, we have to know
that this outside knowledge whatever we have

282
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:31,259
has to have roots and we have to go to our
roots. We cannot live with this outside knowledge,

283
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:38,259
we have to know ourselves. Everybody is talking
about self-knowledge. There have been so many

284
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:45,659
books, so many things, I mean so much of seeking
is on, that we cannot just avoid getting to

285
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,720
our spirit, we have to get to it but the only
problem where I stumble down is that people

286
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:59,389
do not have (?). They’re very frivolously
treating the whole thing, those who have got

287
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:06,389
realization for them the Kingdom of God is
awaiting. They are not only welcome but they’ll

288
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:10,570
be cherished and that’s what has to be done.

289
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:17,490
You have to cherish your Spirit, your Self
- you’ve not done it. Only just getting

290
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,350
realization, feeling satisfied about it itself
is not sufficient. “Now I’m realized,

291
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,210
all right, I’ve got the cool breeze, I’m
this.” No, you have to grow. It’s still

292
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:32,999
a sapling that has to grow, for that you don’t
have to pay anything, nothing. Here these

293
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:39,009
people, really I tell you, they are working
so hard because they have achieved a certain

294
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:45,419
height in Sahaja Yoga. They don’t take any
money. They were just like you, they had to

295
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:50,799
work hard to first establish themselves, because
that is the time where people want to say,

296
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,809
"No, Mother said Sahaj, so all right, we’ll
sit at home."

297
00:31:54,809 --> 00:32:00,639
That is only for sprouting I said Sahaj, but
we have to look after because we have had

298
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:07,210
conditionings, we have had problems, we have
had physical problems, we have had social

299
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:14,210
problems, we have had psychological problems.
They are to be attended to and the Kundalini

300
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:22,419
just goes and raise this energy there. Unless
and until you know how to maneuver it or work

301
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:30,639
it out, it is very difficult for this Kundalini
to manage by Herself. You have to show the

302
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,370
will. If you do not have the will nobody can
force on you. The Divine is not going to fall

303
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,450
at your feet. "All right, all right, get your
realization." You have to knock at the door,

304
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:48,450
and these doors are only six - not many. Six
doors which are partly opened out, again closing,

305
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:56,669
again opening out. You have to just know how
to knock and how to keep them open, finished.

306
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,429
Then you become the light, and once you become
the light you give light to others.

307
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:08,429
That’s how this world is going to be saved.
No other way out, no other way out. We have

308
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:14,190
to have transformation; we have to become
the Spirit. We have to be enlightened and

309
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:21,190
to be the light in the Great Being that is
our Creator, our Preserver and the One who

310
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:34,509
is our existence itself. All these things
are so simple. They may look bombastic when

311
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:43,379
we see from outside, but when you come inside
it’s so simple, it’s very easy. Sahaj

312
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:49,330
also has another meaning that’s “very
easy” - apart from it is spontaneous, it

313
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,870
is very easy. We don’t want to do something
easy. Like if we can eat our food like this

314
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,960
we’ll not, we’ll have to take our hand
like this, and if you can eat in a difficult

315
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,179
way then it’s very good. That’s human
nature. They want to do something like that.

316
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:09,179
Like some people suggested to Me, "Mother
when You go to India and settle down there,

317
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,119
then we’ll make these people that, ‘If
you have to get realization, you have to go

318
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,210
to Mother. Then you must stay on a mountaintop
where there will be freezing cold.’ Let

319
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,470
them climb up seven miles and then they will
come to You and they’ll get their realization.

320
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:28,780
Otherwise they will not because their ego
will not be satisfied with given things."

321
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,710
What about Me? I don’t want to trouble you,
why should you? I’ve taken all the troubles;

322
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,869
Christ has taken all the troubles for you.
Everybody has taken troubles, you better enjoy

323
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:46,869
now. You have to enjoy it; just you have to
get it.

324
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,849
There’s no end to My lectures. I’ve been
lecturing and lecturing and lecturing and

325
00:34:53,849 --> 00:35:00,680
I would say that this subject is so interesting
that all here there are at least 60 percent

326
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,380
people who must have heard thousands of My
lectures. Still they would like to hear more

327
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,390
and more [Shri Mataji laughs as She speaks]
so I would suggest that we finish at this

328
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:15,290
point, but know that once you become the knowledge
it’s easier to understand what we are saying.

329
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,770
It’s very simple but only thing you have
to become the Spirit.

330
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,280
May God Bless You.

331
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,270
Now I would like to have some questions but
I’ve seen people when they ask questions

332
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:33,829
they are representatives of some horrid gurus.
Their horrid gurus pay them some money because

333
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:38,780
they take a lot of money then they pay them
some money. Then they come here as identified

334
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,130
with these gurus. I have to request them what
have you got out of that guru? Why are you

335
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:50,130
so much enamored by him? Why are you so much
charmed by that, what have you got? He’s

336
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:59,140
using you. So please when you ask questions
ask independently, freely, I’ll be very

337
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:07,079
happy to answer you but I don’t like that
you are talking because somebody has told

338
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,520
you something. Whatever you know you ask me
I’ll be very happy to answer those questions

339
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,520
to you.

340
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:32,490
May God bless you.

341
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:58,410
Question: You mentioned Christ, you mentioned
the Holy Ghost, you mentioned the Kundalini.

342
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,790
If Christ is the Son, what is the Kundalini?

343
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:13,790
Shri Mataji: She is the Mother. Christ within
us is the Spirit and Kundalini is the Holy

344
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:21,319
Ghost, which is the Mother. The reflection
of Holy Ghost within us is the Kundalini and

345
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,720
the reflection of Christ within us is the
spirit. But everybody has played the role.

346
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:51,349
Like Moses, like Abraham, like Socrates, like
Lao Tze, everybody has played the role to

347
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,250
build up this drama they are all part and
parcel of one being. This one you must understand.

348
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:07,780
When they said there is one God, he’s not
like rock of Gibraltar. Even rock of Gibraltar

349
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:14,329
has got different molecules you see but to
ask God is one means, I don’t know, I can

350
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:21,329
not think of such thing just a one block.
He’s not, He has many aspects and these

351
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,440
aspects are expressed in these different ways.
Of course He’s one, united, integrated,

352
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,200
one; but all these aspects are there, and
this one God is either in the pockets of the

353
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:47,180
priests or the pockets of the Brahmins or
the pockets of the mullahs or the pockets

354
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:54,180
of someone. One God.

355
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:09,050
Question: Does the Kundalini have any relationship
to the Virgin Mary, the physical Mother of

356
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:15,990
Jesus?

357
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,730
Shri Mataji: It is, very much so. Yes you
asked the same question. She is the Virgin

358
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:29,730
the (kanya?) but gradually when you come to
Sahaja Yoga you will know the Virgin Mary,

359
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:38,940
what is Her exposure is, how many times She
was born even in India, what is Her relationship

360
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:47,710
and how great She is. But why Martin Luther
did not talk about Virgin Mary? I asked My

361
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:55,859
father who was a realized soul and he gave
a good explanation. He said it was (?) it

362
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:01,750
means according to the circumstances at the
time, that time suddenly he found that he

363
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:08,750
has to take the people in a more enlightened
field and he is doing so he wanted Muslims

364
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,339
also to be included, and if you suddenly talk
about the Mother, they may not accept.

365
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:24,339
So for that he avoided, but actually he knew
that one day somebody will explain. But human

366
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:35,950
nature is such I must say that if you accept
one flower, you’ll not accept another, and

367
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:42,950
when they’re dead - not when they’re living,
never, never. When they’re living we’ll

368
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:48,380
never accept it, we’ll never listen to them.
But once they’re dead then wonderful because

369
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,559
he’s in our pocket, do what you like, it’s
very common.

370
00:40:54,559 --> 00:41:01,559
We had one Gyaneshwara, a great saint in India,
very great saint and they have built huge

371
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:08,240
big temple for him and he is in a statue.
So when we went there they said, "You cannot

372
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,450
do meditation here."

373
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,559
I said, "Why? What did he do? He did meditation."

374
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,170
He said, "No, you have to do that kind of
a dance they do called (?)"

375
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,020
I said, "But he did not do it.'

376
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:25,960
He said, "So what? We do this way. He was
another; he was great. We are not so we have

377
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,450
to do this"

378
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,329
So I didn’t know how to argue at with that,
so I said, "Look at the statue. Now you are

379
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:38,069
in a statue, better come in a form to tell
all these people.” But when he came in form

380
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:45,069
he didn’t even have shoes to wear. He burnt
his feet on charred grounds. Nobody gave him

381
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,000
water to drink. All the saints suffered.

382
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,250
Any other question please? Yes.

383
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:54,079
Question: Do you need to believe in God to
get realization, like Buddha didn’t believe

384
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:01,390
in God but still got realization.

385
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:08,390
Shri Mataji: All right, Buddha did not believe
that’s not the point - He did believe but

386
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,950
He didn’t say about God. I also didn’t
say in the beginning about God, because if

387
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:20,950
you start talking about God it creates problems.

388
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,770
That he said all these things because, why,
that’s what I’m trying to tell you. You

389
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:49,770
see it is (?) the time, that time. What he
thought that the people in India especially

390
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:56,599
were worshipping a God in a temple, the Brahmins,
this, that. The Brahmins thought this is a

391
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,460
God; they had pocketed all the money and all
those things. So how to bring them out of

392
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,920
it? He said, “Don’t talk of God; don’t
talk of anything. Talk of the Self. First

393
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,500
step is Self.”

394
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,730
He said, “First they will have the Self,
then they will know where is the God.” Of

395
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:19,480
course in the temple also we have some things,
which we can say are swayambus, which are,

396
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:26,480
come out of Mother Earth. It is said in one
of the commandments that whatever is created

397
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:33,599
by Mother Earth or by the heavens should not
be reproduced, but there is something created.

398
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:41,780
So these temples were all completely monopolized
by Brahmins and these Brahmins tried to rule

399
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:52,660
the whole country, that’s the thing happened.
So Buddha thought, how to get these people

400
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:56,869
out and He talked about the Self only and
nothing else. He said, “First Self”, and

401
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:03,630
I also felt the same way in the beginning.
but now the time is different. Now I would

402
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:10,630
say that it can go to any extent this stupidity
of these fundamentalists. Like in Nasik when

403
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:17,500
Mahatma Gandhi returned from England they
said, “You have to go for (? Chitta)”

404
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,809
- means a repentance – “You have to go
in for repentance because you put your foot

405
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:28,859
on a foreign land.” Imagine! And they would
not allow him to exist. They would not allow

406
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:35,859
him to exist and he had to do it. He said,
“Now get rid of these mad people.” He

407
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:44,950
had to do it and it was a Brahmin who killed
him ultimately.

408
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,200
So I mean, it’s a very funny world, you
know and in that world we come and we tell

409
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,880
about something that is truth - which is truth,
which is good, which is benevolent, which

410
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:08,799
is the thing, but people just kill. I mean
there is no need - at least if you don’t

411
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,930
want to hear, all right. Don’t kill them,
but they kill. Even Mohammed Sahib was given

412
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:22,930
poison, even Buddha was tortured by the people,
very much tortured in the beginning and His

413
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,030
disciples also went to extremes later on,
not his own disciples but his followers.

414
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:39,030
So now we have people who beat the seekers
on their back. We had one gentleman, his name

415
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:48,140
was, he called himself Omkar. He came from
some Llama and he had a broken spine and I

416
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:54,859
had to work for days together to put his spine
right, and they used a stick to hit him. Can

417
00:45:54,859 --> 00:46:01,859
you imagine? Is it God? Is it religion?

418
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:11,569
So Buddha and Mahavira, these two persons,
at that time did not talk of God, both of

419
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:20,430
them. Later on they again incarnated and talked
of God as Hassan and Hussein, as Kabira. And

420
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:09,130
the illusion was that every time He turned
His feet the carpet turned with Him. They’re

421
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,880
all one; we are only fighting because we don’t
see the oneness. So because of the time they

422
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:41,950
did speak but they did not cut out, they had
to say, “Stop at this point”, not more

423
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,200
because that was the situation. You can see
that. All right? So it’s logical.

424
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,089
Question: Do you have to do any practices
to raise the force?

425
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:58,089
Shri Mataji: No, first of all I’d better
do it in a different way that you all get

426
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,720
your realization, first of all. Then of course,
as I said, your Kundalini attends to your

427
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:16,720
problems. She goes down, so then I have to
tell you how to raise it, how to bring it

428
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,539
back, how to correct yourself. Once you’re
established, you can do it to others. So we

429
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:28,089
can say it is in three parts. First is your
establishment, like we can say the sprouting

430
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:33,420
of the seed. So that’s the awakening first
of all or realization as you touched. And

431
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:40,420
then the second part you establish yourself.
In the third part we establish others. All

432
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,010
right?

433
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:15,010
Question: (repeated by Sahaja Yogi) Are You
speaking of Kundalini awakening? Others talk

434
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:40,799
about it and then deliver the goods, is this
what You’re saying? Yes.

435
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:46,849
Shri Mataji: It’s true. That’s true. Easy
to talk about anything. It’s true when one

436
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:53,130
need not talk. There’s no need to talk,
it works silently. It is working in all of

437
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:00,130
you. That’s the right approach, who delivers
the good. That’s right, he said the right

438
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:10,640
thing. Who delivers the good? We can be satisfied
with artificial things you know, we can, we

439
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,880
can be. Be careful on that point, you said
the right thing. Correct.

440
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:49,569
Question: As a realized soul how can one help
social problems such as problems in Ethiopia

441
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,240
and so on?

442
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:02,240
Shri Mataji: Well very much. Now Ethiopia’s
problem comes from two angles, two angles.

443
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:11,609
First is Ethiopia you know that the Rastafarians.
Have you heard about them? It comes from them;

444
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:21,760
Rastafarians took to the wrong side. In their
religion itself you are supposed to take the

445
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,359
drugs and with taking drugs where will you
go? Into your collective subconscious, and

446
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:32,680
what is in your collective subconscious is
so injurious that it can give you cancer.

447
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:39,230
Cancer comes from the left side, which we
call as the collective subconscious. It can

448
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:44,859
give all kinds of diseases, which cannot be
cured. Most of the incurable diseases come

449
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:51,859
from there and also the famine. The trees
will burn. If you want to find out about a

450
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,880
person if it is true or not see the flower.
Flower will just burn off, if there’s a

451
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:07,079
person who is possessed by the left side,
it will just burn off. The cows will not give

452
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:13,470
milk, all things will happen in the nature,
and when there are so many people who are

453
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:20,470
doing this nonsensical thing and having all
the left sided movement of their attention,

454
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,490
they catch onto these and that’s how the
whole thing works on their nature. That’s

455
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:34,490
one thing. Now a realized soul if he goes
to Ethiopia, by his mere existence there,

456
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:44,839
the nature may change. If he is of a very
evolved soul it will, even with attention

457
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,329
he can.

458
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:53,329
Now the second point is, what is gone wrong?
You see this is what you say is the sin, the

459
00:52:53,819 --> 00:53:00,819
sin, the wages of sin is fear, it’s much
more than fear. It acts, this is a sin to

460
00:53:02,609 --> 00:53:09,609
go to these things and succumb to collective
subconscious. Instead of rising higher, keeping

461
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:16,460
in the center, going to the right and the
left we can call it is the sin but in a very

462
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:22,690
wider sense of the word. All right? Now this
is one thing that the country has indulged

463
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:29,690
too much into the left side will be grabbed,
will be definitely grabbed into the power

464
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:37,980
of negative forces, no doubt about it. Their
trees won’t grow, their flowers won’t

465
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,240
prosper, their children will die. They will
have negative population, they will have all

466
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,079
problems of terrible diseases even AIDS comes.
AIDS also comes from the same area. It’s

467
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:47,829
a very serious thing and when collectively
people start doing it, you just entering into

468
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:50,839
the satanic land where everything can work
out. That’s one thing, no use giving them

469
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:57,839
money, it’s very temporary. Easy money is
the worst thing; you have to give them something

470
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:06,440
solid, something permanent, something eternal,
something living, which will make them grow.

471
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,809
That’s one point.

472
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:18,809
The second point of Ethiopia is a very collective
happening, which happened in Ethiopia. I met

473
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:25,960
a minister by chance from Ethiopia who was
traveling with Me in the train and he told

474
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:33,079
Me it was a political game. The politics which
is not benevolent is no politics at all, it’s

475
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
a dirty game; and when you go to the extremes
you see the falsehood is such a nonsense,

476
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:53,650
such an ignorance, such a darkness that you
start moving in it you don’t know where

477
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:59,750
you go till you reach your complete doom;
and when you see that you don’t understand

478
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:06,750
what have we done, because to move on a slope
is the easiest and that’s how Ethiopia has

479
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,579
landed in trouble.

480
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:19,579
Third point which comes to Me very important
that applies to all the nations, whether they

481
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:27,960
are developing or developed, that we don’t
realize that we are part and parcel of one

482
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:34,960
world. God never created a separate world.
It’s one world. Like one human being it

483
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:44,180
has a heart, all right? It has a liver, it
has everything but it’s one and that we

484
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:51,180
are all part and parcel of this. I would say
that Roosevelt once said that poverty anywhere

485
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:58,660
is a threat to prosperity everywhere, and
when he said that I think he understood the

486
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:03,779
subtle thing. Anywhere in the body there is
poverty, means if there is any disease is

487
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:10,779
a threat to the whole body. But for that we
are not yet there, we are not grown up, we

488
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,410
are still so insular, so insular.

489
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:25,119
Like the other day we had a lady who was English,
I must say, she came, and in My house I have

490
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:31,130
- because my husband is international diplomat
traveling a lot - we have got things from

491
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:38,130
everywhere and she only appreciated English
things, invariably even without knowing. She

492
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:46,260
couldn’t appreciate anything even if for
sixth century, second century she wouldn’t.

493
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:55,059
So insular, we are all insular, everywhere,
whether it’s Indian, whether it’s English

494
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:02,230
whether it’s American, we are very insular
people, self-opinionated. We are not global.

495
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:09,900
Unless and until we become global, problems
of the world cannot be solved. As if this

496
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:18,020
finger of a leper is affected and then there
is no sensitivity in the whole body. Then

497
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:28,950
what happens that if a rat comes and takes
away the finger the leper doesn’t know.

498
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:34,160
So the lepers if you go to a leper home they’ll
say, “Just have the light for us to see”,

499
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:41,160
but this light when it comes within you see
that we are part and parcel of the whole and

500
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:48,319
that’s how you grow up into the global personality.
We are still English, British, Irish, Welsh.

501
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:57,740
I was surprised even the Welsh won’t like
them to be called British. I mean it’s such

502
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:04,740
a little land like that. Imagine in the heart
if you have cells, which do not call themselves

503
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:11,210
cells of the heart, what will happen to that
heart? It will collapse.

504
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:17,910
It is happening everywhere, it’s not only
in one country it’s the same as I said in

505
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:23,890
every country we are very insular people.
We have to expand and how do we expand, how

506
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:30,890
do we expand? Through our Spirit. As you can
see the characters of these people they were

507
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:35,829
global they never talked about one country,
two countries, three countries, they talked

508
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:42,829
for everyone. This is the third big mistake,
which all the countries are doing and they

509
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:54,069
are fighting, for what? Why are they all fighting,
why are they having wars? God did not create

510
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:03,599
wars, did He? It’s not His mistake. This
world belongs to Him and not to us. All theories

511
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:18,710
they become self-destructive how can that
be called as a benevolent politics? In Sahaja

512
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:28,940
Yoga we will have the politics of Socrates,
of giving and of not taking. But we have to

513
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:45,500
have that race raised into that personality
that global personality. Can I do it alone?

514
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:53,010
You all have to help Me.

515
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:06,660
Question: She’s no will power whatsoever,
She’s been a drug addict for 15 years, She

516
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:17,599
just wonder she can….

517
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:24,599
Shri Mataji: Don’t you worry, it’s all
there it will come back don’t you worry,

518
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:34,640
all right? Don’t you worry. Love is the
most powerful thing, we have never used the

519
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:40,750
power of love, don’t you worry.

520
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:47,750
Question: I followed Swami Vivekananda for
years, advocated stern practices for years

521
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,130
and years ….

522
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:07,130
Shri Mataji: Now he is dead and gone, all
right [laughter…applause]. I’m sitting

523
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:23,230
here; I’m your Mother, all right? I agree,
I know, I know all that, all horrid things

524
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:31,900
forget it. I’m your Mother, all right? If
I can work it out only with My love, why should

525
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:38,890
you worry about Vivekananda? It’s all right,
forget it, that’s over. You have done it

526
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,990
in previous life. Vivekananda had to do it
in this life but you have done it before,

527
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:48,160
all right? You all have finished with it,
now you just get your prizes. [Shri Mataji

528
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:55,160
and everyone laughs]You don’t have 
to do anything like that. You see a person
who has to cook who has never cooked before

529
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:08,789
has to go through all rigmarole. But supposing
your Mother knows cooking. She’s done the

530
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:15,789
cooking. Come along and have the food, finished.
Why to worry? All right? It’s already made.

531
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:26,220
You are a seeker, you have been a seeker.
You have done all that many lives, you’ve

532
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:33,220
been to Himalayas so now forget it, forget
it. Better have it, all right? There are so

533
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:39,240
many here I can see that kind.

534
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:46,240
Question: Can we have the food that You’ve
prepared?

535
01:02:46,339 --> 01:02:53,339
Shri Mataji: You’re hungry, that’s great.
Let’s have it, all right? Should we? Now

536
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:57,549
do not analyze anymore, just have it, don’t
analyze, when you’re hungry you don’t

537
01:02:57,549 --> 01:03:02,559
analyze from where did you get it, what has
happened, how (will) you cook it. You just

538
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,440
see the fun, that’s all. You just enjoy
it, that’s a good idea.

539
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:13,440
Question: After you die, would you like to
go to heaven or do you wish to stay around?

540
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:29,970
Shri Mataji: Who I? I die? I think of the
present never of the future. You be in the

541
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:39,329
present, don’t worry about the future. We
should worry about the present, that’s why

542
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:47,819
you see Buddha talked about the Self. Why
talk of the future? Doesn’t exist for Me.

543
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:51,640
Question: Present and future bind together

544
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:58,180
Shri Mataji: Yes, Yes but you become first
the present, otherwise there’s no binding.

545
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:03,569
Either you are in the future or in the past,
first of all become the present. There’s

546
01:04:03,569 --> 01:04:08,700
no binding, that’s the chain is missing,
that’s why I’m saying become the present.

547
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,339
All right?

548
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:17,339
Question: I want to know the answer, are You
going to stay around or are You going to go

549
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,069
to heaven when You die?

550
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:33,069
Shri Mataji: I’m already in heaven (laughter…
applause) would you like to join Me? You please

551
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:51,900
join Me in heaven, all right? I’m already
in heaven. I see the heaven around Me everywhere,

552
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:59,519
only thing you have to enter into that subtle
thing. It’s so beautiful; it’s so beautiful.

553
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:09,079
All right, now you don’t have to do much,
but as I said we have problems within ourselves.

554
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:25,170
We have to little bit work out ourselves,
our awakening and doing so you will know also

555
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:31,029
later on if the Kundalini falls off how to
raise it. It’s very simple, not much. You

556
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:38,029
have to use your left and right hand because
as Mohamed Sahib has said that at the time

557
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:43,740
of resurrection your hands will speak, in
the sense that you get your collective consciousness

558
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:49,390
and your fingertips become enlightened. So
as all the doctors will also say that we have

559
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:53,970
a sympathetic nervous system acting on our
fingertips.

560
01:05:53,970 --> 01:06:00,970
Now when you put the left hand towards Me,
it represents your desire to be self realized.

561
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:07,029
So just you have to put your left hand like
this nothing else is to be done - simple,

562
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:14,029
but in a humble way. If you say, “now give
me realization”, all right, but we have

563
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:22,299
to be humble. That’s very important. When
we are humble, we are peaceful and the thing

564
01:06:22,299 --> 01:06:29,119
works out faster. So do not analyze it just
get it. It’s simple how to eat the food

565
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:29,829
I’m just telling you.

566
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:34,400
Put your left hand straight like this. First
of all it’s better to take the advantage

567
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,339
of Mother Earth so you have to take out your
shoes. You can keep your socks but better

568
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:46,339
to take out your shoes, because sometimes
they can be very tight and your hats. Anything

569
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:55,750
tight, which makes you uncomfortable, should
be loosened, that’s all.

570
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:03,950
Now, just put your left hand straight like
this. Everyone should try to do it, it’s

571
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:10,190
very simple, it’s not going to take much
time, it’s very simple. Nothing is going

572
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:16,539
to happen to you but, on the contrary, you
will become at least ten years younger, that’s

573
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:23,539
a promise. You see a mother when she gives
castor oil, also she has to cover it with

574
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:30,299
some chocolates. So now this is one of the
temptations for many people must be, but there

575
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:36,000
are so many other things that I cannot describe
in this short lecture. So I would say that

576
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,529
just put your left hand because this is your
own power within you, which you do not know,

577
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:46,380
just put your left hand just like this. All
of you please put your left hand on your lap

578
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:53,380
very comfortably. Now your right hand is the
one, which is the power of action. With this

579
01:07:53,730 --> 01:08:00,730
you act, so you have to use your right hand
just first on your heart centre then because

580
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:08,760
in the heart resides the Spirit. Then I’ll
tell you one by one, but just now can see

581
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:15,410
on the upper part of the stomach, in the lower
part of the stomach, then again in the upper

582
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:22,410
part of the stomach, then on the heart, then
here, then here, then here. I will tell you

583
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:32,489
one by one everywhere and then on top of your
head here, stretch your hand palm, put it

584
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:36,279
down there and press it hard, that’s all.
It’s very simple.

585
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:42,089
Now this all has to be done with the right
hand, just remember this one point and left

586
01:08:42,089 --> 01:08:48,580
hand here. What are these centers? I will
tell you. One by one, you need not remember.

587
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:54,230
It’s all in the book, but just now you know
that it is to be worked out on the left-hand

588
01:08:54,230 --> 01:09:01,230
side. Because left-hand side is our desire
and we are putting our hand of our desire.

589
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:08,719
Now the left hand is already quite heavy I
must say, all right, so now. You put your

590
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:16,109
left hand just like this and at the very outset,
as I’ve told in every Western program, you

591
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:26,859
have to forgive yourself. You’re not to
feel guilty for anything whatsoever even for

592
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:39,089
reading Vivekananda. You have to be pleasantly
placed towards yourself; after all you are

593
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:46,130
the temple of God. So don’t despise yourself,
don’t think low of yourself, forgive yourself

594
01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:55,089
and say with full confidence that you’re
not guilty. This is a fashion also, everybody

595
01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:01,870
wants to say “I’m guilty.” It’s a
fashion, it’s just a fashion. So please

596
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:08,870
don’t consider yourself guilty for anything
you have done in the past what you think of

597
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:16,050
the future. Let your present come up and then
you will know that all these were mythical

598
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,630
ideas. The truth has to come.

599
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:28,260
So now you have to close your eyes. Don’t
open your eyes. There’s no mesmerism going

600
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:34,300
on, so no need to keep the eyes open. But
in any case keep your eyes shut till I tell

601
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:39,730
you to open, because when the Kundalini is
rising it’s better to keep your attention

602
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:45,889
inside. At least through the eyes the attention
goes out, so if you keep your eyes closed

603
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:52,540
the Kundalini rises much better. Sometimes
She does not rise if your attention is out,

604
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:59,230
so I know attention cannot be inside, but
when you close your eyes at least it is not

605
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:05,840
going out too much. So the Kundalini rises
and It sucks in all your attention, like I

606
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:11,219
can say in My sari if I have the Kundalini
rising like that it sucks in the sari like

607
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:18,210
the attention, In the same way it goes up
and ultimately pierces through here. It should

608
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:23,540
happen, you all should certify yourself, nobody
needs certify you. Once you say you are feeling

609
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:28,110
the cool breeze then you can ask somebody
to see you. If you are not feeling it, don’t

610
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:35,110
get desperate, you all can feel it. There
are so many here sitting and I’m sure you

611
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:39,880
can be told and helped. And then once you
get it, you have to help others. That’s

612
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,860
how we are going to work it out.

613
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:51,860
So now please put left hand like this, right
hand on your heart. Now here close your eyes.

614
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:07,380
In the heart resides the Spirit, so please
ask Me three times a question in your heart,

615
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:18,090
not loudly. Please ask Me sincerely a question.
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can

616
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:29,080
call Me “Mother”, whatever you like. “Mother,
am I the Spirit? Mother, am I the Spirit?

617
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:37,630
Mother, am I the Spirit?” Now this is a
fundamental question you’re asking to a

618
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:44,630
computer, which has to give you the answer.

619
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:05,800
Now this question is followed by another question
when you put your right hand in the upper

620
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:27,900
part of your stomach on the left-hand side.
You’re working everything on the left-hand

621
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:34,900
side and press it hard. Now here is the centre,
which gives you the power of mastery over

622
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:45,570
yourself, the mastery over the divine knowledge,
the mastery over the working of the divine

623
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:52,290
knowledge. That means you become your own
master, you become your own guru, nobody can

624
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:59,290
dominate you, nothing can dominate you, no
habits can dominate you. So at this point

625
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:06,400
you press your fingers dig them down here
you have to ask the second question to me,

626
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:15,170
Mother am I my own master? Ask this questions
three times please, with full faith in yourself

627
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:22,889
ask this question: “Mother, am I my own
master? “ This will neutralize all your

628
01:14:22,889 --> 01:14:29,889
useless feelings and everything. “Mother
am I my own master?”

629
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:57,050
Now please take your hand down in the lower
part of your abdomen and press it hard there

630
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:05,969
on the left-hand side, keep the left hand
towards me. Now here is the centre, which

631
01:15:07,409 --> 01:15:14,409
is working out the divine technique, the pure
knowledge, the true art of this technique

632
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:26,010
is worked out through this centre here. At
this centre I cannot force you in any way

633
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:37,610
that you should ask me for your self-realization.
It should be your own desire free will ask

634
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:48,730
for it. So here you please ask Me, “Mother,
may I have the true knowledge?” This has

635
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:04,469
to be said six times because there are six
petals to this center. “Mother, may I have

636
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:11,469
the true knowledge, the pure knowledge of
the divine technique?”

637
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:21,570
(Why don’t you do? You’re so young, please
try, it’s very easy. For young people to

638
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:31,040
be that adamant is not good. But please try,
it’s worth it.)

639
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:41,679
Six times please. You must learn to listen
and sometimes understand, all right? Now raise

640
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:36,360
this hand again on the left-hand side, on
the same center of the principle of the mastery

641
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:44,110
on the upper part of your abdomen of your
stomach, on the left-hand side, And now press

642
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:51,710
it hard. This center has got ten petals, so
here now you have to help your Kundalini to

643
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:03,710
rise by asserting the truth, by saying ten
times with full confidence in yourself, “Mother

644
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:14,800
I am my master. Mother I am my own master.
Mother I am my own master.” Please say it

645
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:24,310
ten times.

646
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:08,760
Now again you raise your hand on top of your
heart and put it there with full confidence

647
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:17,760
here, as this centre has got twelve petals
you have to say with full confidence in yourself

648
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:25,170
the truth, “Mother I am the Sprit.” You
are the Spirit, so please say with full confidence,

649
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:32,170
“Mother I am the Spirit.” Believe Me,
you are the Spirit. Twelve times.

650
01:20:19,889 --> 01:20:26,889
You have to know that Divine is the ocean
of God’s love. It is the ocean of His forgiveness

651
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:37,670
and you cannot do anything that He cannot
forgive. He’s that powerful, His forgiveness

652
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:44,520
is that powerful, so there’s no need for
you to feel guilty about anything whatsoever,

653
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:51,520
by that you’re challenging His power of
forgiveness. So now you raise your hand in

654
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,760
the angle of your neck and your shoulder and
push it back towards the spinal chord and

655
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:19,020
press it very hard. Now this is the most difficult
center in the West. As I said, when you feel

656
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:25,800
guilty you catch this center and you get all
kinds of troubles like angina also troubles

657
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:31,150
like spondylitis and so many other problems.

658
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:38,150
Now press it hard and with full confidence,
you say sixteen times, “Mother I’m not

659
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:49,090
guilty.” Sixteen times. You have to be pleasant
with yourself; you have to cherish yourself

660
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:01,960
and not to condemn yourself at all by any
chance. You are not guilty. So please say,

661
01:22:03,989 --> 01:22:08,719
“Mother, I am not guilty at all” sixteen
times. But those who still want to go ahead

662
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:15,710
with it punish themselves by saying it 108
times. That would be the best. (Shri Mataji

663
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:20,739
blowing on her hand and rubbing Her hands)
So much heat coming out from there, so much

664
01:22:20,739 --> 01:22:27,739
of heat. “I’m not guilty.”

665
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:37,360
Put your left hand towards Me, say with full
confidence. Wow, this is the worst hurdle,

666
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:46,820
I tell you. It’s just a myth; it’s a conception
in your head that you’re guilty. What guilt

667
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:58,530
can you have that cannot be washed by the
great power of God’s love and forgiveness?

668
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:07,100
(Shri Mataji is rubbing Her hands) Sixteen
times or 108 times. You do not know how to

669
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:16,409
love yourself. You’re supposed to be selfish
but there’s no selfishness I think. (Shri

670
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:23,409
Mataji is blowing hard and rubbing Her hands)

671
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:06,790
Now raise this hand on your forehead across
and press it on both the sides. Now, here

672
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:18,880
is the center where you have to forgive others.
I will not say how many times but from your

673
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:27,070
heart, please say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,
I forgive everyone, I forgive everyone.”

674
01:24:29,449 --> 01:24:36,210
Now maybe you might say it’s very difficult,
but it’s not all because it is mythical.

675
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:42,770
What do you do by not forgiving or forgiving?
Is nothing, but when you don’t forgive you

676
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:49,340
play into the hands of wrong people. So just
say, “Mother, I forgive everyone, everyone

677
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:55,119
I forgive.” This is the greatest weapon
Christ has given us - to forgive. Forgive

678
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:58,510
everyone, forgive everyone, forgive everyone.

679
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:05,510
Now for 

680
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:28,850
your own satisfaction you may put your hand
on the backside of your head, backside of

681
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:37,400
your head. Here is the center where you have
to say that “If I have done anything wrong

682
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:46,900
against the Divine, please forgive me.”
You have to ask the Divine the forgiveness,

683
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:54,850
so that there’s no doubt in your mind or
sort of lurking guilt. Say that three times

684
01:25:58,469 --> 01:26:05,469
of from your heart it will work out, but don’t
count the mistakes, so called. Just say that,

685
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:20,360
saying is sufficient. Saying is the enlightened
chanting, all right?

686
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:28,489
Now stretch your hand put it on top of your
head, bend you head a little bit forward.

687
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:37,570
On top of your head, bend it and now rub it
hard the scalp seven times. Here again I cannot

688
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:50,770
cross your freedom, so you have to say, “Mother,
I want my Realization.” I cannot force it

689
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:56,580
on you, so just say, “I want my Realization.”
I can only persuade you, but I cannot force

690
01:26:56,580 --> 01:27:02,360
it. You have to ask for it. So please say
seven times, “Mother, please may I have

691
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:09,360
my realization? Please give me my Realization”
seven times. (Shri Mataji blows seven times

692
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:36,080
into the microphone)

693
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:44,850
Now bring down your right hand, put it towards
Me. Slowly open your eyes and put your left

694
01:27:53,270 --> 01:28:00,270
hand bending your head a little bit on top
of your head here, little higher and see if

695
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:05,489
there’s a cool breeze coming out. With the
left hand you see, not with the right, right

696
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:10,130
hand towards Me, the right hand towards Me,
the left hand just try to see if you’re

697
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:17,130
feeling any cool breeze out of your head,
all right? Don’t get upset. If you’re

698
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:27,040
not feeling doesn’t matter, we’ll work
it out. Doesn’t matter. Now turn it round

699
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:36,310
again put it here the right hand, see with
the right hand if you’re feeling the cool

700
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:43,310
breeze. Some people don’t feel it, doesn’t
matter. Nothing so desperately bad. There

701
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:52,080
is, I can see that. Now left hand again, little
higher, maybe little higher, some people feel

702
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:20,929
it very high you see, it shoots off, just
see.

703
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:26,830
Now you may put your hand up towards the sky
and ask the question, “Is this the All-Pervading

704
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:33,830
Power of God’s love? Is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost? Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

705
01:29:35,239 --> 01:29:42,239
Ask the question three times. Now, such a
lot, all the Sahaja Yogis sitting here. Are

706
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:04,110
you feeling? Cool breeze? Or what? Something
happening? Now put back your hand, now don’t

707
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:11,110
analyze it just see in the hands are you feeling
any cool breeze in the hands. All right, little

708
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:24,900
bit, some feel a little bit; but it’s all
right, the beginning has started. Now most

709
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,719
of you have got the right hands less, so put
the right hand towards Me, left hand like

710
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:38,719
this towards the sky, it will ventilate. Left
hand like this and now forgive, forgive everyone,

711
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:53,440
everyone you forgive, just forgive. That’s
the mantra. It will release, left hand up.

712
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:05,590
Right hand towards Me and left hand up. Now
right hand towards Me. Moving, is it? Slowly,

713
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:15,560
slowly it will move, right hand is difficult
because mostly we are very right-sided people,

714
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,590
mostly. Yes, good.

715
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:32,590
Now with the left hand you put towards Me
and right hand towards the Mother Earth like

716
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:39,960
this. Left hand towards Me and right hand
towards the Mother earth. This is what we

717
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:47,739
are doing: we are correcting the elements
within us, bringing them into balance. Which

718
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,850
you will know very soon what it was, what
we were doing. You’ll know everything. No,

719
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:59,750
no left towards Me, left towards Me and right
towards the Mother Earth. Right towards the

720
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:06,750
Mother Earth. Left towards Me, right towards
the Mother Earth. Mmm, better. All right?

721
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:17,380
Now all those who have felt the cool breeze
in the head or in the hands raise your both

722
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:46,159
the hands. All 

723
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:40,540
of you? Practically? The sprouting has started.

724
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:05,690
May God bless you.
