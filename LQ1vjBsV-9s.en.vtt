WEBVTT

00:02.216 --> 00:09.458
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

00:09.779 --> 00:16.750
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

00:16.951 --> 00:24.332
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva
that we are going to worship today.

00:26.996 --> 00:35.176
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

00:36.512 --> 00:46.460
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

00:46.785 --> 00:56.065
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

01:03.608 --> 01:11.985
The combination between Sadashiva
and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

01:12.186 --> 01:20.326
is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight.

01:20.527 --> 01:25.847
We cannot understand such relationship in human being,
among human marriages

01:26.048 --> 01:30.673
or among human relationships.

01:35.512 --> 01:40.406
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

01:41.234 --> 01:51.170
which is the desire of Sadashiva, is being witnessed by Him.

01:52.094 --> 01:58.653
And when He is watching this creation

01:58.854 --> 02:07.884
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

02:08.570 --> 02:15.158
He witnesses the whole universe

02:15.935 --> 02:21.489
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

02:21.690 --> 02:28.853
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

02:29.641 --> 02:33.923
His power is of witnessing

02:35.154 --> 02:42.987
and the power of Adi Shakti

02:43.384 --> 02:48.874
is this all pervading power of love.

02:51.203 --> 02:57.658
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

02:59.761 --> 03:07.789
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti as the Primordial Mother

03:07.990 --> 03:13.869
and She expresses Her power as love.

03:15.673 --> 03:21.834
So the relationship between the two is extremely

03:24.632 --> 03:29.737
understanding, very deep,

03:30.490 --> 03:34.232
and whatever She‘s creating,

03:35.139 --> 03:41.308
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

03:41.509 --> 03:47.031
or there are people, human beings specially

03:47.232 --> 03:55.969
who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods

03:57.017 --> 04:04.160
who are not the deities are trying to express their egos,

04:04.845 --> 04:10.141
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

04:12.457 --> 04:19.644
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.

04:20.758 --> 04:27.462
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

04:27.663 --> 04:33.245
among all the creations He pulsates.

04:33.446 --> 04:43.129
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy of the Primordial Mother.

04:43.896 --> 04:52.927
And He can destroy anything that goes against
the plans of the Adi Shakti.

04:53.128 --> 05:00.737
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

05:00.938 --> 05:07.637
She loves Her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

05:07.838 --> 05:12.475
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

05:12.676 --> 05:22.246
She wants human beings to go to that level where

05:22.447 --> 05:27.427
they enter into the Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Sadashiva

05:27.628 --> 05:34.582
where there is bliss, there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

05:36.773 --> 05:45.016
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

05:45.217 --> 05:55.769
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

05:56.809 --> 06:06.977
This desire within us is reflected as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.

06:07.178 --> 06:13.766
Now this desire is there and other mundane desires are also there

06:13.967 --> 06:20.256
which stop the progress of your ascent.

06:21.551 --> 06:27.542
In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried

06:27.743 --> 06:34.043
to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa
or running away from the house

06:34.244 --> 06:38.788
or for all kinds of things that has been suggested.

06:38.989 --> 06:46.272
The first thing that is done is that you get the light of your spirit.

06:46.473 --> 06:50.595
Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva.

06:50.796 --> 06:54.568
In that light He shows, He is just showing the path.

06:54.769 --> 07:04.261
The spirit is just like a light which is burning and which is showing the path.

07:04.840 --> 07:10.830
In that path you yourself become so wise

07:11.031 --> 07:19.816
that you walk in the light of wisdom,
that you walk in the light of righteousness.

07:20.017 --> 07:26.760
Because whatever is destructive is seen through the light of your spirit.

07:26.961 --> 07:31.028
You start giving up all that is destructive.

07:31.981 --> 07:35.918
Nobody has to tell you that give up this, give up that.

07:36.119 --> 07:41.648
You yourself realize that this is wrong and we should give up.

07:42.215 --> 07:50.714
This was, I should say, my own understanding of human beings

07:50.915 --> 07:58.546
because these are the days where people are in complete illusions.

07:58.747 --> 08:04.020
They are in a conflict all the time struggling even to exist.

08:04.221 --> 08:08.525
Under these circumstances, everything would have failed

08:08.726 --> 08:15.509
if you had started with taking a sanyasa
and then going to Himalayas and all that.

08:15.710 --> 08:22.588
If you have to do this for the masses, something has to be done radical

08:22.789 --> 08:28.410
and luckily I’ve been able to find out a way by which

08:28.611 --> 08:36.420
you can get your sprouting, your Realization.

08:36.621 --> 08:43.019
Now some people who get Realization have to understand certain things

08:43.220 --> 08:49.672
because as you know there are many people who have got Realization.

08:49.873 --> 08:53.566
I don't know how many, I don't keep count.

08:53.767 --> 08:59.938
But what is lacking in them is surrendering.

09:02.713 --> 09:06.819
It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact.

09:07.020 --> 09:16.582
This is the only condition of modern Sahaja Yoga
that you have to really surrender.

09:16.783 --> 09:22.982
If you start using your brain, if you start using other methods

09:23.183 --> 09:28.999
to understand Sahaja Yoga, you cannot. You must surrender

09:29.200 --> 09:35.994
and as Islam is nothing but surrender, Islam means surrender.

09:36.478 --> 09:42.246
And if that surrender is not there

09:42.801 --> 09:51.819
it is impossible to establish anyone in the Kingdom of God.

09:54.990 --> 10:05.083
Surrender is not that you should give up your family, give up your children,

10:05.284 --> 10:10.700
or give up your houses and homes and your properties.

10:10.901 --> 10:16.002
Surrendering is here: give up your ego to begin with

10:16.203 --> 10:19.719
and then give up your conditionings.

10:19.920 --> 10:26.975
For example, the other day I met one gentleman and he is suffering a lot.

10:27.396 --> 10:34.194
So I asked him, "Who is your Guru?", so he gave Me one name of a Guru.

10:34.395 --> 10:40.252
I said, "He’s not done any good to you, will you give him up?"

10:40.475 --> 10:45.281
He said, "Tomorrow." I said, "Why not today?"

10:45.482 --> 10:49.452
He said, "Today, but I have to throw away all his things.

10:49.653 --> 10:52.816
So tomorrow morning I will do it." I said, "All right, do it."

10:53.017 --> 10:56.257
"What should I throw away, Mother?" I said,

10:56.458 --> 11:01.591
"Then all the things with which you worshipped him, throw away, throw away."

11:02.776 --> 11:09.390
Then he went around the whole house,
found out whatever was there which was used

11:09.591 --> 11:16.740
for worshipping him, everything he gathered together, threw in the sea.

11:16.941 --> 11:21.317
And then he told the sea that, “I am sorry

11:21.518 --> 11:27.131
I have suffered a lot because of this man, now you please don't suffer.”

11:27.992 --> 11:35.281
So this kind of a very penetrating intelligence if you don't have

11:35.482 --> 11:41.525
you cannot give up. One sticks to that.

11:41.726 --> 11:46.564
I know of so many who find it so difficult to get rid of their conditionings.

11:46.765 --> 11:50.947
That’s more difficult than ego.

11:51.399 --> 11:55.034
Mundane conditionings and condition schemes that you have.

11:55.235 --> 11:59.726
We have first conditioning that supposing you are born

11:59.927 --> 12:03.736
in India or England or any place.

12:04.181 --> 12:08.715
After Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen most of the people they suddenly start

12:08.916 --> 12:12.464
seeing what’s wrong with their countrymen,
what’s wrong with their country,

12:12.665 --> 12:17.392
what’s wrong with their religion,
what’s wrong with the books they were reading.

12:17.593 --> 12:24.661
Immediately they start seeing it clearly,
that this was the mistake, this is wrong.

12:24.877 --> 12:28.841
They all make fun of them. I’ve seen people all over the world.

12:29.042 --> 12:36.395
Nobody says that ‘No, no, no, no, because we are English,
we are the best,

12:36.596 --> 12:40.709
we are Russians so we are the best,
or we are Indians we are the best’.

12:40.910 --> 12:43.672
Immediately they find out what’s wrong with them

12:43.873 --> 12:47.351
and why these people are not getting Realization.

12:47.552 --> 12:50.577
On the other hand they feel such compassion

12:50.778 --> 12:53.858
that ‘Mother, so many people haven't got their Realization.

12:54.059 --> 12:57.815
Why shouldn't we try to give them Realization?’

12:58.016 --> 13:02.479
This is the double action of this light.

13:02.680 --> 13:09.255
Firstly you know that there is light
and that you have become the light.

13:09.456 --> 13:14.928
So wherever your attention goes you start seeing reality

13:15.129 --> 13:19.369
and then you understand that this has been the conditioning

13:19.570 --> 13:24.096
of our country, of our society.

13:24.297 --> 13:30.589
And then they abhor all that is wrong,
they never identify with it.

13:30.798 --> 13:35.068
But first thing as I said, is surrendering.

13:35.269 --> 13:44.866
In surrendering actually you develop
a kind of a state where I would say

13:45.604 --> 13:52.840
you become a sanyasi, from within.

13:53.463 --> 13:58.934
That means nothing can dominate you, what is a sanyasi is a person

13:59.135 --> 14:06.921
who is above everything else. Nothing can stick to him.

14:07.159 --> 14:13.253
He just looks at things and he knows what it is.

14:13.454 --> 14:20.110
He may not say, he knows everything
and he doesn't do whatever is wrong.

14:20.311 --> 14:26.891
He’s so detached, that in that detachment
only he can see what’s wrong with him.

14:27.092 --> 14:31.845
He starts seeing his family people, he starts seeing other surroundings,

14:32.046 --> 14:36.531
everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong.

14:36.732 --> 14:40.423
And he does not identify with them, is very surprising.

14:40.624 --> 14:44.587
I have seen it, I mean, I went to Turkey.

14:44.788 --> 14:50.742
In Turkey I met one gentleman who was running a big Swiss hotel

14:50.943 --> 14:54.794
and he came himself to Me and said, "Mother, give me Realization."

14:54.995 --> 15:00.028
I was surprised because I didn't see this in Switzerland
such a anxious personality

15:00.229 --> 15:02.642
would ask for Realization, very surprising

15:02.843 --> 15:08.073
that in Turkey he should ask for Realization.
And I gave him Realization

15:08.274 --> 15:13.158
and immediately he said, "I am not going to go back to Switzerland.”

15:13.792 --> 15:18.480
Just imagine! It’s, you see, it is so clear-cut

15:18.681 --> 15:25.550
that this light definitely gives you tremendous wisdom and balance.

15:25.751 --> 15:31.700
Supposing you are walking
and you can't see the road, you may fall down.

15:31.901 --> 15:34.378
But if there’s little light also you can see it.

15:34.579 --> 15:39.907
And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done,
is given you very little light.

15:40.108 --> 15:45.499
That little light itself has been sufficient for you
to give up so many things.

15:45.700 --> 15:49.872
Now the other side of it is the ego part.

15:50.691 --> 15:55.621
Ego is very subtle stuff with human beings.

15:55.822 --> 16:01.042
I don't know how they gather it, but they do and some of them have

16:01.243 --> 16:07.660
such a gullible ego that with the slightest thing it shoots off.

16:07.861 --> 16:13.039
And they get very angry for small things or if they find somebody

16:13.240 --> 16:17.860
whom they can dominate, they can dominate also that person.

16:18.061 --> 16:24.112
Now this ego when you start seeing it,
you just start laughing at yourself

16:24.313 --> 16:27.537
and think that, what’s wrong with me.

16:27.738 --> 16:32.582
Ego is not like conditioning which is coming from outside

16:32.783 --> 16:37.791
but ego is something that comes from within.
It can come from anything.

16:37.992 --> 16:42.569
Human beings have ego of all kinds of nonsensical things.

16:42.770 --> 16:49.024
One day I met one lady and she was very proud
and was not even smiling.

16:49.183 --> 16:53.259
I said, "What’s the matter with this lady, what is she?"

16:53.426 --> 16:57.103
So they told Me, "She knows how to make dolls
that’s why she’s so proud.”

16:57.304 --> 17:01.168
I said, “Eh, to make dolls, she’s so proud!”

17:01.369 --> 17:05.769
"Yes, you know, she can make dolls, so she’s so proud."

17:05.970 --> 17:10.454
I said, "What is there, anybody can make dolls, so what is so great?"

17:10.655 --> 17:13.777
"No, but she thinks she is very great because she makes dolls."

17:13.978 --> 17:21.436
So a man becomes stupid and stupid.
That is first sign of a egoistical person.

17:21.637 --> 17:26.652
He is so stupid that when you are talking to him,
you just get flabbergasted

17:26.853 --> 17:30.832
that without paying anything you have got a buffoon before you

17:31.033 --> 17:36.245
who is showing all joke, jokes of his buffoonery.

17:36.446 --> 17:40.960
Is something very surprising,
I mean, you meet any egoistical person

17:41.162 --> 17:46.672
and you just watch him: “I did this, I am, I, I, I ...”

17:46.873 --> 17:52.361
Then you start seeing the person,
what’s the matter, he’s not even ashamed to say

17:52.562 --> 17:58.847
things that should not be said.
Then it goes even to the sinful life they lead.

17:59.048 --> 18:04.973
They lead a very sinful life, they fond of women,
they drink and this and that.

18:05.174 --> 18:09.676
Then they start boasting about that also:
“I drank that day so much;

18:09.877 --> 18:14.282
I had five women around me.” They start boasting of that also.

18:14.483 --> 18:18.685
So, for a egoistical man there is nothing like shame.

18:18.886 --> 18:21.744
He’ll go on telling about his nonsensical things

18:21.945 --> 18:25.584
and everybody will say, ‘My God, with whom are we talking?’

18:25.785 --> 18:30.715
And then, whatever they do they justify.

18:30.916 --> 18:33.844
I asked one fellow, "You had such a bad heart attack.

18:34.045 --> 18:36.840
Why do you drink now, give up drinking."

18:37.041 --> 18:40.891
He said, "But even this person Kirloskar” - we have one in Poona

18:41.092 --> 18:47.029
who is now, I think, 95 – “he drinks”.
So I said, "You are not Kirloskar,

18:47.230 --> 18:51.380
and even if he drinks, what’s the use, what is he gaining by that?"

18:51.581 --> 18:57.850
"No, no, you see he’s very good,
because, see, he drinks and he’s so successful."

18:58.028 --> 19:01.779
"Is he successful without, because of drinking?"

19:01.980 --> 19:07.341
But even ordinary reasoning is not there, ordinary reasoning.

19:07.542 --> 19:14.663
And in the general way if you see,
even if you see the greatest drunkard countries,

19:14.864 --> 19:20.554
I have never seen a statue of a man who died of drinking, never.

19:20.755 --> 19:23.660
I’ve not seen in any country people are praising a man

19:23.861 --> 19:30.174
because he had ten women or he died of drinking. So far!

19:30.375 --> 19:34.409
I don't know how far human beings can go in their ego.

19:34.610 --> 19:38.121
Now this ego is spreading very much in modern times

19:38.322 --> 19:45.760
where they start saying, "I like this, I don't like this".

19:46.845 --> 19:50.606
“What, what you don't like?” "I don't like this kind of a sari,

19:50.807 --> 19:53.946
I don't like this kind of clothes, I don't like this."

19:54.147 --> 19:57.935
But who are you, you are not going to see yourself,
others are going to see.

19:58.136 --> 20:01.009
So what difference does it make whether you like it or not?

20:01.210 --> 20:06.379
But is very common with young people, to talk like that "I like."

20:06.674 --> 20:10.892
And this is a sign of complete destruction.

20:11.093 --> 20:16.780
Because ego is not only, is, makes you stupid,

20:16.981 --> 20:19.592
you see all these days the way people dress up

20:19.793 --> 20:24.923
and we find they are very stupid because "I like it, so what?”

20:25.124 --> 20:29.108
Anything they like it, you know, if they want to walk on their heads

20:29.309 --> 20:32.560
"I like it, what’s wrong?”

20:32.886 --> 20:37.721
All kinds of stupidity can be explained through ego.

20:37.923 --> 20:45.168
So those who get Realization somehow or other, thank God, see it:

20:45.406 --> 20:49.212
This is my ego talking.

20:49.714 --> 20:55.922
Then they start laughing at themselves, making fun of themselves:

20:56.123 --> 21:02.238
This was my ego. But also in Sahaja Yoga there are people,

21:02.439 --> 21:06.991
I said, "Why don't you go and organize?"
"Mother, because my ego will come up."

21:07.192 --> 21:12.687
I said, "What’s this?” “My ego will come up so I don’t want to organize."

21:12.888 --> 21:19.227
How can your ego come up? If you see your ego, supposing you see,

21:19.428 --> 21:25.552
something is burning, you see it there.
How can you get that burning onto yourself?

21:25.753 --> 21:32.713
But this is a very subtle type of, avoiding work of Sahaja Yoga

21:32.914 --> 21:35.388
to say that "No, I’ll get into ego."

21:35.589 --> 21:40.728
I said, "All right you get into ego, I’ll see to it, get in, what happens."

21:41.424 --> 21:50.054
So all kinds of things there are which makes a person quite idiotic and stupid.

21:51.654 --> 21:57.307
I mean, I don't know how many things I can tell you today.

21:57.508 --> 22:02.613
But also I’ve seen in marriages this is very common.

22:02.814 --> 22:07.753
They’ll say that, ‘Mother, I married this girl at that time

22:07.954 --> 22:11.798
but now I don't think I should have been married.’

22:11.999 --> 22:17.258
Bah, bah, what, that time, what had happened to you,
why didn't you marry at that time?

22:17.460 --> 22:20.341
I have to tell you these things because I’ve been facing

22:20.542 --> 22:25.511
all kinds of problems of this stupid, idiotic ego.

22:26.467 --> 22:29.731
One has to see it clearly,

22:29.932 --> 22:36.044
how this ego is working in me and how it is keeping me down.

22:36.245 --> 22:41.150
So when we talk of ascent, we talk of a higher life.

22:41.351 --> 22:48.599
We have to become sanyasi like the lotus that comes out of the pond

22:48.800 --> 22:53.344
and no water can stay on them.

22:53.756 --> 22:59.748
Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay on them.
Just like that we have to become.

22:59.949 --> 23:04.044
We don't have to wear sanyasis dresses, nothing of that.

23:04.245 --> 23:10.979
But from inside, a kind of a detached attention is there

23:11.180 --> 23:18.653
which immediately locates the problem, within you and without.

23:18.854 --> 23:24.671
And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how to overcome that.

23:24.872 --> 23:34.293
It’s a very effective, efficient system.

23:34.642 --> 23:38.128
But for that again, to achieve that

23:38.329 --> 23:44.164
you have to become Shiva within, means detached.

23:44.365 --> 23:49.456
As Shiva is completely detached, you have to be detached.

23:49.657 --> 23:55.970
And that detachment will give you the same wisdom as Shiva has.

23:56.172 --> 24:04.890
Shiva sees, we should say, Sadashiva sees the work of Adi Shakti, silently.

24:05.091 --> 24:09.705
He doesn't get proud, He doesn't develop a kind of a ego

24:09.906 --> 24:17.791
‘Let me see now what my Iccha Shakti is doing’, nothing, He’s just watching.

24:18.105 --> 24:22.562
But when it comes to destruction,

24:22.763 --> 24:27.311
He sees that this part is going to destroy the work,

24:27.512 --> 24:32.447
immediately He destroys, removes that portion.

24:32.796 --> 24:41.603
In the same way we have to be,
we have to see our life itself is a big field.

24:41.804 --> 24:47.844
How do we consider ourselves to be?

24:48.122 --> 24:51.418
I have seen people talk, "Oh, so what, I am a Sahaja Yogi!"

24:51.641 --> 24:55.383
You can't talk like that if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

24:58.142 --> 25:03.145
With folded hands you have to say, “I am a Sahaja Yogi”.

25:03.597 --> 25:08.907
In your behavior, in your talk, in everything,

25:09.108 --> 25:16.318
you have to be a person who is extremely humble.

25:19.216 --> 25:26.755
If that is not so that means Sahaja Yoga has given you double ego.

25:27.923 --> 25:33.164
As it is you know that Shiva is known for His innocence,

25:33.365 --> 25:38.225
for His simplicity, His forgiveness. He forgives.

25:38.426 --> 25:43.873
He forgives rakshasas; He’ll forgive everyone, that is His quality.

25:44.074 --> 25:52.273
But anybody who goes against the Primordial Mother, He doesn't spare.

25:53.353 --> 25:57.270
So this is His, the quality one has to understand,

25:57.471 --> 26:01.123
surrendering doesn't mean outside things to be surrendered.

26:01.324 --> 26:06.050
What is there, these are all stones, what are you surrendering?

26:07.098 --> 26:15.359
Surrendering means cleansing yourself completely,
getting completely detached.

26:15.560 --> 26:20.613
Detachment is the only way you can rise.

26:34.247 --> 26:37.661
Some people get sick, they make such an ado out of it:

26:37.862 --> 26:43.262
“I am sick, the whole world should know
I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.”

26:43.463 --> 26:47.839
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you just watch,

26:48.040 --> 26:52.211
how so, I am sick, all right, let’s see.

26:52.545 --> 26:57.325
Just like a sport. Just watch.

26:58.296 --> 27:03.235
I am sick. So, what’s happening now?
The temperature is coming nicely,

27:03.436 --> 27:08.403
now is going down, you just sort of a

27:10.521 --> 27:14.615
playful, mirthful attention.

27:14.909 --> 27:20.669
Ah, when I came I had temperature,
but nobody believes I had temperature.

27:20.870 --> 27:23.672
I was so tired in the marriage they said, "You don’t look tired."

27:23.874 --> 27:31.368
I said, "All right, I’m not tired."
In the same way, life also is to be played.

27:31.569 --> 27:41.013
It’s just a play, and that play has to be seen
through the light of wisdom.

27:41.214 --> 27:46.330
Nothing is so serious, for Sahaja Yogis nothing is so serious.

27:46.531 --> 27:54.975
But he becomes very serious and
he makes too much ado about himself.

27:55.961 --> 28:00.783
There are lots of things which we have to learn.

28:00.984 --> 28:06.636
When we worship Shiva, we praise Him.
You are this, you are that, you are that.

28:06.837 --> 28:09.728
When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this.

28:09.929 --> 28:13.120
I am not aware of all that that you say. But you say all right,

28:13.321 --> 28:16.599
if you say so, it’s all right. You are this, you are that,

28:16.800 --> 28:22.629
the thousand names of Shiva, thousand name of the Goddess,
thousand name of Vishnu.

28:22.830 --> 28:28.495
These are their names you are worshipping, what about you people,

28:29.154 --> 28:32.284
how many names you can have?

28:32.538 --> 28:38.151
Actually in the puja when you take the names of these Shaktis

28:38.352 --> 28:42.987
they also get awakened within, no doubt.

28:43.241 --> 28:49.780
After Puja you do feel that way but you don't utilize them.

28:50.471 --> 28:54.187
So many people I’ve seen have come in the puja

28:54.388 --> 29:02.316
and they have got that power within themselves, same powers.

29:02.650 --> 29:07.621
But by the time they are out, it’s finished, it’s gone.

29:07.822 --> 29:15.609
So, surrendering has another side: assumption.

29:17.540 --> 29:22.554
Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi

29:22.791 --> 29:28.819
and I can absorb all these powers within myself.

29:29.409 --> 29:33.040
So one side is surrendering.

29:33.453 --> 29:36.949
Why to surrender? To absorb.

29:38.283 --> 29:43.400
Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb.

29:44.395 --> 29:50.106
But once you have absorbed, then you should retain

29:50.307 --> 29:56.166
and assume within yourself, know that you have these powers.

29:57.264 --> 30:01.377
There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more.

30:01.578 --> 30:05.431
First time it happened, no Sahaja Yogi would touch anybody,

30:05.632 --> 30:08.108
raise anybody's Kundalini, this thing, that thing.

30:08.309 --> 30:11.839
We had at least fifty Sahaja Yogis by then.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.803
I said, "Now what to do, I have prepared these channels

30:15.004 --> 30:20.219
and nobody is even raising their fingers.
How am I going to work it out?"

30:20.420 --> 30:21.988
Very difficult!

30:22.189 --> 30:28.216
But once it happened we had a program in Nasik Road
and I was staying in Nasik.

30:28.417 --> 30:32.269
It’s about, I think, thirty miles from there.

30:32.615 --> 30:37.368
So, we reached halfway and our car failed

30:37.569 --> 30:43.127
and nobody, no other car was coming, nothing, no support, nothing.

30:44.423 --> 30:50.618
I didn't know what to do. But these, all the Sahaja Yogis had arrived there,

30:50.819 --> 30:54.291
and such a big crowd. They started saying, "When is Mataji coming?

30:54.492 --> 30:58.377
When is Mataji coming?" Such a pressure!

30:58.578 --> 31:01.717
So they said, "It’s all right, we’ll give you Realization, sit down."

31:01.918 --> 31:04.514
And they gave Realization.

31:04.715 --> 31:08.370
That’s the first time the Sahaja Yogis started knowing that they can

31:08.571 --> 31:12.740
give Realization, they can do this, they can do that.

31:12.994 --> 31:17.462
They all started after that.

31:17.663 --> 31:23.059
So assumption should be there, that I have these powers,

31:23.260 --> 31:26.848
I am not going to waste them, I am going to use them,

31:27.049 --> 31:31.821
I am going to look after others, I am not going to just keep to myself.

31:32.022 --> 31:37.431
This assumption has to come. Once I was traveling by ship

31:37.632 --> 31:43.206
and one fellow got caught up in the freeze room and he got pneumonia.

31:43.407 --> 31:47.397
So the captain came to Me ‘That see this boy has got pneumonia,

31:47.598 --> 31:50.151
we have to get some doctor by helicopter.’

31:50.352 --> 31:53.506
I said, "Captain, I’ve given you Realization, you are a doctor."

31:53.707 --> 31:57.254
He said "Who, I?” “Yes, you." "If you want, I can go down."

31:57.455 --> 32:00.278
"No, no, no, but tell me what to be done." I said "Just go

32:00.480 --> 32:06.643
and put your hand on his heart, finished." "I" he said. "Yes, you!"

32:06.844 --> 32:12.876
Went down and put his hand and the fellow got all right.

32:13.315 --> 32:15.838
He was amazed.

32:16.784 --> 32:21.179
He met Me now in the wedding – and he was amazed at himself.

32:21.380 --> 32:25.302
"This I can do to anyone?" "Yes, yes, you can!”

32:26.056 --> 32:32.168
But if you do not assume, and just sit down meditating,
meditating, surrendering …

32:32.369 --> 32:35.200
what’s the use?

32:37.614 --> 32:41.842
So, you have to do,

32:42.342 --> 32:50.764
now after achieving Shiva state you have to
start doing the work of Adi Shakti.

32:52.473 --> 33:00.156
You should get this desire that we should spread Sahaja Yoga,
we have to work it out.

33:00.357 --> 33:03.505
But be careful sometimes you might be conditioned,

33:03.706 --> 33:06.531
you might be egotistical, watch yourself.

33:06.732 --> 33:11.226
With watching you can, I’m sure, you can achieve a lot.

33:11.427 --> 33:15.415
We have done, some people who have taken it upon themselves

33:15.616 --> 33:19.650
have done it, everywhere, in every country.

33:19.851 --> 33:24.921
So the first thing of surrendering is important

33:25.122 --> 33:30.168
to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva and Sadashiva.

33:30.369 --> 33:38.258
But the second state is that you have to now think of others.

33:38.480 --> 33:42.960
First it is as they say in Sanskrit is vyashti,

33:43.161 --> 33:47.600
means individual gain, you get the individual gain.

33:47.801 --> 33:54.457
And then it becomes samashti, means the collective.

33:54.658 --> 33:58.606
You have to work it out on collective.

33:59.035 --> 34:03.196
People who never even got Realization, nothing of the kind,

34:03.397 --> 34:07.358
have been doing so much organization and this and that.

34:07.559 --> 34:11.952
While you have got everything, so now it is important

34:12.153 --> 34:17.750
that you should now extend this light to others.

34:31.175 --> 34:34.029
Forgive Me, I had to speak in English here.

34:34.149 --> 34:39.211
Many people have come from outside for Shivji puja,

34:39.332 --> 34:41.532
it has never happened before.

34:42.018 --> 34:48.709
And about Shivji – you people know a lot.

34:49.110 --> 34:53.271
And all His stories also, you all know. But what is the substance?

34:53.861 --> 35:02.574
What is the essence? What is the essence of Shivji – you should know.

35:03.882 --> 35:09.004
About Shivji, nothing touches Him.

35:09.550 --> 35:14.312
If someone says anything to Him and then apologizes to Him,
He’ll say, “Alright go, you are forgiven”.

35:14.420 --> 35:16.053
Nothing touches Him.

35:16.192 --> 35:20.237
Praise/insult, happiness/ sorrow –

35:20.396 --> 35:22.771
nothing touches Him.

35:22.916 --> 35:28.469
He is Shivji, completely detached from everything – free.

35:28.991 --> 35:34.255
Like Adi Shankaracharya has told, ‘Shivoham, Shivoham’
[I am Shiva, I am Shiva].

35:34.483 --> 35:40.156
So first during the time of Adi Shankaracharya ‘Shivoham’
[I am Shiva] was talked about.

35:40.270 --> 35:46.655
It was being said, ‘I am Shiva’, alright.

35:47.211 --> 35:55.955
To reach that state, it happens through individual endeavor.

35:57.194 --> 36:02.580
And after that the other state –

36:02.699 --> 36:08.703
the way Adi Shakti is working, like that you have to work.

36:09.074 --> 36:15.256
Otherwise if these two things don’t take place simultaneously,

36:15.444 --> 36:17.723
then what is the use of attaining Shiva’s state?

36:17.878 --> 36:19.545
They are sitting.

36:19.897 --> 36:25.784
If Shiva could do everything, then why did He create Adi Shakti?

36:25.870 --> 36:30.409
Why did He tell Adi Shakti, ‘You create everything. You do that, you do this’?

36:30.639 --> 36:33.450
He could do everything, but no.

36:33.682 --> 36:36.856
He told, ‘there is one state – ‘Shiva’s state’.

36:37.095 --> 36:43.268
On reaching the Shiva’s state you become completely desire less’.

36:43.740 --> 36:46.893
Then whatever you do; now I see that some people say,

36:46.988 --> 36:52.911
“Mother there is one person in Sahaja Yoga and he is laundering money”.

36:53.206 --> 36:55.121
I don’t understand,

36:55.270 --> 36:58.923
“After coming to Sahaja Yoga, how are they laundering money?”

36:59.028 --> 37:02.623
Someone is there who is showing his ego, his position.

37:02.730 --> 37:05.039
Some or the other crazy things,

37:05.111 --> 37:07.563
even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they are continue doing.

37:07.881 --> 37:10.857
Something must be stuck to them, it’s possible.

37:11.089 --> 37:12.554
But they should get rid of it.

37:12.839 --> 37:17.678
So when you have come to Sahaja Yoga first you attain Shiva’s state.

37:18.234 --> 37:21.877
Meaning in which you are completely desire less.

37:22.289 --> 37:24.306
For that surrender,

37:24.438 --> 37:28.021
after complete surrendering you can come in Shiva Shakti.

37:28.293 --> 37:32.520
Shiva’s Shakti is that He is absolutely detached.

37:32.590 --> 37:37.691
Nothing influences Him. He neither has ego,

37:37.912 --> 37:42.291
nor does He have refinement.

37:43.355 --> 37:48.319
He came for His wedding sitting on a Bull.

37:48.525 --> 37:54.189
He is spreading His legs and sitting and the Bull is running and
He is just holding one to it somehow and coming.

37:54.392 --> 37:57.261
On reaching there,

37:57.792 --> 38:01.687
even Parvathi was feeling shy, ‘What is this?
My Groom is arriving like this?’

38:01.767 --> 38:04.430
What difference does it make to Him?

38:04.592 --> 38:06.581
He doesn’t want that He sits on a horse

38:06.641 --> 38:09.573
and goes in a ‘Baraat’ [marriage procession] proceeding Him.

38:09.610 --> 38:14.053
In the ‘Baraat’ someone has one eye,
[marriage procession of the groom]

38:14.191 --> 38:16.251
someone’s teeth have fallen.

38:16.340 --> 38:18.972
He is taking such people and going.

38:19.340 --> 38:24.997
For Him, he doesn’t even realize these things –

38:25.143 --> 38:28.058
who is what? Who is wearing what clothes?

38:28.284 --> 38:30.301
Whose eye is where?

38:30.394 --> 38:32.591
How a person is accompanying dumbly,

38:32.679 --> 38:35.113
some stupid person is accompanying,

38:35.193 --> 38:39.435
some half-naked person is walking along –

38:39.658 --> 38:41.847
these things don’t matter to Him.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.535
He is desire less, however you are come along.
Whoever is coming along can.

38:45.681 --> 38:48.311
Otherwise when we go in a ‘baraat’ we have to wear such

38:48.338 --> 38:53.329
and such clothes, we have to go like this,
have to sit on a horse etc. etc.

38:53.395 --> 38:58.494
And if there is ever a small short fall,
then it causes lot of unpleasantness. He’s not like that.

38:58.639 --> 39:02.402
He is going in His Baraat accompanied by people however they are.

39:02.567 --> 39:06.588
Because this is the sign of desirelessness and He is innocent.

39:06.835 --> 39:10.033
Innocent because unwanted things don’t come in His head.

39:10.166 --> 39:14.098
A person who is innocent doesn’t understand these things.

39:14.691 --> 39:17.905
I have seen that many people when they go to someone’s place –

39:18.100 --> 39:21.400
‘what carpet has been laid?’

39:21.495 --> 39:25.046
Have you gone to meet the carpet or the person?

39:25.340 --> 39:28.801
Some lady comes – ‘what saree was she wearing?’

39:28.937 --> 39:36.436
You have come to meet the person, you go to the substance,
go to the essence and understand what the person is.

39:36.595 --> 39:37.985
That part is ignored.

39:38.072 --> 39:43.820
Just what they were wearing? What is in their house?
It was like this, like that.

39:44.090 --> 39:51.231
This kind of sight – just looking at things
superficially is not Shiva’s way.

39:53.064 --> 39:57.528
Now just see Him in His own life – He went and sat in the Himalaya.

39:58.525 --> 40:00.918
He is not bothered about anything –

40:01.068 --> 40:03.928
‘What if someone says something, I have to be like this,

40:04.405 --> 40:09.071
I have to have this thing or that thing’ – nothing.

40:10.650 --> 40:17.683
When His first wife died, He carried Her body on His back and went.

40:17.761 --> 40:20.515
Who will do that? No one will do that.

40:22.242 --> 40:26.176
All His methods are special, exceptional. Because He is exceptional.

40:26.946 --> 40:34.561
About anything He doesn’t have a fixed criteria
that it has to be like this only or like that only.

40:35.448 --> 40:40.799
But if you look at the essence then
what according to Him is right,

40:41.179 --> 40:44.915
only that He feels is right.

40:45.685 --> 40:51.352
What according to Him is wrong, is wrong.
These convictions of His does not change.

40:52.587 --> 40:58.619
He even gave His wife to Ravana.

40:58.785 --> 41:04.235
Now people will say, ‘What is this drama –
giving away His wife to Ravana?’

41:04.689 --> 41:09.097
He knows His wife is a Devi, what can Ravana do?

41:11.090 --> 41:16.585
To whomever He gives, She is Sakshat Devi.
She will set Him right – Ravan.

41:17.806 --> 41:20.857
Our character of seeing everything externally;

41:21.078 --> 41:23.114
as the external ‘eye’ [seeing] decreases,

41:23.274 --> 41:29.201
the inner ‘eye’ [seeing] opens. However the person is.

41:30.861 --> 41:37.230
For ourselves it is alright that we behave properly, that we talk properly.

41:37.309 --> 41:43.799
But however is the other person, understand his essence.

41:43.954 --> 41:45.762
How is the inside of the person?

41:45.961 --> 41:49.998
Some rural people are there, while talking they talk roughly.

41:50.918 --> 41:55.781
Someone’s speech is like, someone is like this. We get angry on them.

41:56.299 --> 42:00.542
We should think ‘that is his way, alright that is also fine,

42:00.941 --> 42:03.582
there is nothing to feel bad about’.

42:03.761 --> 42:06.673
When civilized people come

42:06.776 --> 42:12.637
and you get carried away by etiquette
and realize we have lost everything with them.

42:12.955 --> 42:19.173
So whatever is made beautiful on the outside is only for cheating.

42:20.140 --> 42:23.105
That’s why regarding any exterior stuff,

42:23.523 --> 42:27.432
getting attached to it, seeing it, is wrong.

42:27.725 --> 42:34.723
Now the kind of things happening in the world, especially in our country.

42:35.002 --> 42:44.174
The outside culture that is coming in, so much of external appearance.

42:44.310 --> 42:48.789
If it was not there, people would not be like this.

42:49.292 --> 42:53.973
Gandhiji was there – poor man, he wore a dhoti and went to London.

42:55.602 --> 43:02.059
Now someone tells him ‘in London you have to wear 3 piece suit and go,

43:03.232 --> 43:05.586
how did you come like this?’

43:06.917 --> 43:09.630
He went. Let people say whatever they want to.

43:09.773 --> 43:15.665
Only thing you need to pay attention is that
if someone is dressing up like that for fun then it’s something else.

43:16.148 --> 43:24.579
But once the person is free from inside,
then he does not find anything significant other than the reality.

43:25.369 --> 43:30.925
He will accept the reality –
this is essence of Shivji you should first achieve.

43:31.619 --> 43:35.203
Only when you achieve Shivji’s essence,

43:35.357 --> 43:38.592
only then you can do the work of Adi Shakti.

43:39.304 --> 43:43.416
Now you start working out but have not achieved Shivji’s essence.

43:43.712 --> 43:47.177
Then who will be influenced by it?

43:47.412 --> 43:56.996
You yourself are ‘Shiva’ and then the work being done by you,

43:57.266 --> 43:59.117
it can be so wonderful.

43:59.269 --> 44:03.680
Someone says something, even hurls abuses, did something –

44:05.576 --> 44:07.070
so what?

44:07.848 --> 44:10.632
The word for this is as told by Shri Krishna –
‘Sthita Pragya’ [steady in awareness].

44:10.732 --> 44:14.909
Whatever is happening, let it happen.

44:15.177 --> 44:19.679
Just because someone says something, so what?

44:19.782 --> 44:22.425
But the essence that is within, has to be clean.

44:22.598 --> 44:25.599
The essence inside should not be spoilt.

44:26.082 --> 44:31.648
And in others if it is spoilt, it’s not a problem, it can be set right.

44:33.638 --> 44:40.286
If you tell bad things about others but not about yourself,
then you cannot become alright.

44:41.278 --> 44:47.740
The meaning of surrendering is that
whatever such things are there within us –

44:47.912 --> 44:51.484
forsake them, forsake them, forsake them.

44:52.093 --> 44:59.727
In the end the cleanliness and purity within you which is your Spirit,

45:00.877 --> 45:05.782
just by seeing it you will be joyous.

45:07.640 --> 45:16.902
And that will make you completely capable that you will be astonished,

45:19.076 --> 45:22.682
‘from where did I get this ability?’

45:23.344 --> 45:30.119
Today Shivji’s puja has to take place and it is taking place

45:32.536 --> 45:35.536
and you people are also completely surrendered.

45:35.639 --> 45:42.695
The other side of surrendering is that the way we have received it,

45:43.050 --> 45:45.766
we are Self-Realized.

45:45.919 --> 45:54.104
We are one in a million who have been given this blessing.

45:58.337 --> 46:03.497
‘How much can we work towards it?

46:03.656 --> 46:08.497
How much can we achieve?” – you should think like that.

46:08.954 --> 46:15.053
As it is you people are beyond My imagination.

46:15.130 --> 46:23.932
I had never thought so much of change can come in people.

46:24.605 --> 46:27.350
Never had I thought.

46:27.482 --> 46:32.599
As per that, so much of work has happened in
the whole world that I am surprised.

46:32.830 --> 46:38.409
And it needs to be understood that people
who were in the wrong path

46:39.660 --> 46:41.537
who were going towards their destruction,

46:41.652 --> 46:46.291
they have come up and today they are with us.

46:46.622 --> 46:52.486
It’s such a big thing that the reflection of Shiva in you

46:53.796 --> 46:57.426
which is in the form of Atma, this is a great blessing of it.

46:57.568 --> 47:02.136
All of you are flooded with this blessing, you just have to spread it.

47:02.294 --> 47:09.061
Spread it by surrendering and collectively spread it.

47:09.314 --> 47:16.297
It is not for one person, nor for one rising but for everyone’s upliftment.

47:16.401 --> 47:27.087
The brink at which our world is standing now, we have to save it.

47:27.292 --> 47:32.482
We have to save it completely and this is your responsibility

47:32.692 --> 47:36.628
those who are Sahaja Yogis, who in their life, within them,

47:37.048 --> 47:43.118
in their behavior, in everything, should know how to look for ‘Sahaja’.

47:44.484 --> 47:48.285
Many blessings to all of you.
