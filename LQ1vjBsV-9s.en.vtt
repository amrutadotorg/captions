00:00:02.216 --> 00:00:09.458
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:16.750
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:24.332
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva
that we are going to worship today.

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:35.176
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:46.460
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:56.065
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:11.985
The combination between Sadashiva
and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:20.326
is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight.

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:25.847
We cannot understand such relationship in human being,
among human marriages

00:01:26.048 --> 00:01:30.673
or among human relationships.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:40.406
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:51.170
which is the desire of Sadashiva, is being witnessed by Him.

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:58.653
And when He is watching this creation

00:01:58.854 --> 00:02:07.884
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.158
He witnesses the whole universe

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:21.489
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.853
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:33.923
His power is of witnessing

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:42.987
and the power of Adi Shakti

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:48.874
is this all pervading power of love.

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:57.658
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:07.789
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti as the Primordial Mother

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.869
and She expresses Her power as love.

00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:21.834
So the relationship between the two is extremely

00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:29.737
understanding, very deep,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.232
and whatever She‘s creating,

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:41.308
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:47.031
or there are people, human beings specially

00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:55.969
who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods

00:03:57.017 --> 00:04:04.160
who are not the deities are trying to express their egos,

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:10.141
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:19.644
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.

00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:27.462
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:33.245
among all the creations He pulsates.

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:43.129
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy of the Primordial Mother.

00:04:43.896 --> 00:04:52.927
And He can destroy anything that goes against
the plans of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:53.128 --> 00:05:00.737
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

00:05:00.938 --> 00:05:07.637
She loves Her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:12.475
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

00:05:12.676 --> 00:05:22.246
She wants human beings to go to that level where

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:27.427
they enter into the Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Sadashiva

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:34.582
where there is bliss, there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:45.016
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:55.769
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:06.977
This desire within us is reflected as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.

00:06:07.178 --> 00:06:13.766
Now this desire is there and other mundane desires are also there

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:20.256
which stop the progress of your ascent.

00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:27.542
In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried

00:06:27.743 --> 00:06:34.043
to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa
or running away from the house

00:06:34.244 --> 00:06:38.788
or for all kinds of things that has been suggested.

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:46.272
The first thing that is done is that you get the light of your spirit.

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:50.595
Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva.

00:06:50.796 --> 00:06:54.568
In that light He shows, He is just showing the path.

00:06:54.769 --> 00:07:04.261
The spirit is just like a light which is burning and which is showing the path.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.830
In that path you yourself become so wise

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:19.816
that you walk in the light of wisdom,
that you walk in the light of righteousness.

00:07:20.017 --> 00:07:26.760
Because whatever is destructive is seen through the light of your spirit.

00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:31.028
You start giving up all that is destructive.

00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:35.918
Nobody has to tell you that give up this, give up that.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:41.648
You yourself realize that this is wrong and we should give up.

00:07:42.215 --> 00:07:50.714
This was, I should say, my own understanding of human beings

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:58.546
because these are the days where people are in complete illusions.

00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:04.020
They are in a conflict all the time struggling even to exist.

00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:08.525
Under these circumstances, everything would have failed

00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:15.509
if you had started with taking a sanyasa
and then going to Himalayas and all that.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:22.588
If you have to do this for the masses, something has to be done radical

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:28.410
and luckily I’ve been able to find out a way by which

00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:36.420
you can get your sprouting, your Realization.

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:43.019
Now some people who get Realization have to understand certain things

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:49.672
because as you know there are many people who have got Realization.

00:08:49.873 --> 00:08:53.566
I don't know how many, I don't keep count.

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:59.938
But what is lacking in them is surrendering.

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:06.819
It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:16.582
This is the only condition of modern Sahaja Yoga
that you have to really surrender.

00:09:16.783 --> 00:09:22.982
If you start using your brain, if you start using other methods

00:09:23.183 --> 00:09:28.999
to understand Sahaja Yoga, you cannot. You must surrender

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.994
and as Islam is nothing but surrender, Islam means surrender.

00:09:36.478 --> 00:09:42.246
And if that surrender is not there

00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:51.819
it is impossible to establish anyone in the Kingdom of God.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:05.083
Surrender is not that you should give up your family, give up your children,

00:10:05.284 --> 00:10:10.700
or give up your houses and homes and your properties.

00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:16.002
Surrendering is here: give up your ego to begin with

00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:19.719
and then give up your conditionings.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:26.975
For example, the other day I met one gentleman and he is suffering a lot.

00:10:27.396 --> 00:10:34.194
So I asked him, "Who is your Guru?", so he gave Me one name of a Guru.

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:40.252
I said, "He’s not done any good to you, will you give him up?"

00:10:40.475 --> 00:10:45.281
He said, "Tomorrow." I said, "Why not today?"

00:10:45.482 --> 00:10:49.452
He said, "Today, but I have to throw away all his things.

00:10:49.653 --> 00:10:52.816
So tomorrow morning I will do it." I said, "All right, do it."

00:10:53.017 --> 00:10:56.257
"What should I throw away, Mother?" I said,

00:10:56.458 --> 00:11:01.591
"Then all the things with which you worshipped him, throw away, throw away."

00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:09.390
Then he went around the whole house,
found out whatever was there which was used

00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:16.740
for worshipping him, everything he gathered together, threw in the sea.

00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:21.317
And then he told the sea that, “I am sorry

00:11:21.518 --> 00:11:27.131
I have suffered a lot because of this man, now you please don't suffer.”

00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:35.281
So this kind of a very penetrating intelligence if you don't have

00:11:35.482 --> 00:11:41.525
you cannot give up. One sticks to that.

00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:46.564
I know of so many who find it so difficult to get rid of their conditionings.

00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:50.947
That’s more difficult than ego.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:55.034
Mundane conditionings and condition schemes that you have.

00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:59.726
We have first conditioning that supposing you are born

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:03.736
in India or England or any place.

00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:08.715
After Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen most of the people they suddenly start

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:12.464
seeing what’s wrong with their countrymen,
what’s wrong with their country,

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:17.392
what’s wrong with their religion,
what’s wrong with the books they were reading.

00:12:17.593 --> 00:12:24.661
Immediately they start seeing it clearly,
that this was the mistake, this is wrong.

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:28.841
They all make fun of them. I’ve seen people all over the world.

00:12:29.042 --> 00:12:36.395
Nobody says that ‘No, no, no, no, because we are English,
we are the best,

00:12:36.596 --> 00:12:40.709
we are Russians so we are the best,
or we are Indians we are the best’.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.672
Immediately they find out what’s wrong with them

00:12:43.873 --> 00:12:47.351
and why these people are not getting Realization.

00:12:47.552 --> 00:12:50.577
On the other hand they feel such compassion

00:12:50.778 --> 00:12:53.858
that ‘Mother, so many people haven't got their Realization.

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:57.815
Why shouldn't we try to give them Realization?’

00:12:58.016 --> 00:13:02.479
This is the double action of this light.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:09.255
Firstly you know that there is light
and that you have become the light.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:14.928
So wherever your attention goes you start seeing reality

00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:19.369
and then you understand that this has been the conditioning

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.096
of our country, of our society.

00:13:24.297 --> 00:13:30.589
And then they abhor all that is wrong,
they never identify with it.

00:13:30.798 --> 00:13:35.068
But first thing as I said, is surrendering.

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:44.866
In surrendering actually you develop
a kind of a state where I would say

00:13:45.604 --> 00:13:52.840
you become a sanyasi, from within.

00:13:53.463 --> 00:13:58.934
That means nothing can dominate you, what is a sanyasi is a person

00:13:59.135 --> 00:14:06.921
who is above everything else. Nothing can stick to him.

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:13.253
He just looks at things and he knows what it is.

00:14:13.454 --> 00:14:20.110
He may not say, he knows everything
and he doesn't do whatever is wrong.

00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:26.891
He’s so detached, that in that detachment
only he can see what’s wrong with him.

00:14:27.092 --> 00:14:31.845
He starts seeing his family people, he starts seeing other surroundings,

00:14:32.046 --> 00:14:36.531
everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong.

00:14:36.732 --> 00:14:40.423
And he does not identify with them, is very surprising.

00:14:40.624 --> 00:14:44.587
I have seen it, I mean, I went to Turkey.

00:14:44.788 --> 00:14:50.742
In Turkey I met one gentleman who was running a big Swiss hotel

00:14:50.943 --> 00:14:54.794
and he came himself to Me and said, "Mother, give me Realization."

00:14:54.995 --> 00:15:00.028
I was surprised because I didn't see this in Switzerland
such a anxious personality

00:15:00.229 --> 00:15:02.642
would ask for Realization, very surprising

00:15:02.843 --> 00:15:08.073
that in Turkey he should ask for Realization.
And I gave him Realization

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:13.158
and immediately he said, "I am not going to go back to Switzerland.”

00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:18.480
Just imagine! It’s, you see, it is so clear-cut

00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:25.550
that this light definitely gives you tremendous wisdom and balance.

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:31.700
Supposing you are walking
and you can't see the road, you may fall down.

00:15:31.901 --> 00:15:34.378
But if there’s little light also you can see it.

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:39.907
And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done,
is given you very little light.

00:15:40.108 --> 00:15:45.499
That little light itself has been sufficient for you
to give up so many things.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.872
Now the other side of it is the ego part.

00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:55.621
Ego is very subtle stuff with human beings.

00:15:55.822 --> 00:16:01.042
I don't know how they gather it, but they do and some of them have

00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:07.660
such a gullible ego that with the slightest thing it shoots off.

00:16:07.861 --> 00:16:13.039
And they get very angry for small things or if they find somebody

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.860
whom they can dominate, they can dominate also that person.

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:24.112
Now this ego when you start seeing it,
you just start laughing at yourself

00:16:24.313 --> 00:16:27.537
and think that, what’s wrong with me.

00:16:27.738 --> 00:16:32.582
Ego is not like conditioning which is coming from outside

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:37.791
but ego is something that comes from within.
It can come from anything.

00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:42.569
Human beings have ego of all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:49.024
One day I met one lady and she was very proud
and was not even smiling.

00:16:49.183 --> 00:16:53.259
I said, "What’s the matter with this lady, what is she?"

00:16:53.426 --> 00:16:57.103
So they told Me, "She knows how to make dolls
that’s why she’s so proud.”

00:16:57.304 --> 00:17:01.168
I said, “Eh, to make dolls, she’s so proud!”

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:05.769
"Yes, you know, she can make dolls, so she’s so proud."

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.454
I said, "What is there, anybody can make dolls, so what is so great?"

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.777
"No, but she thinks she is very great because she makes dolls."

00:17:13.978 --> 00:17:21.436
So a man becomes stupid and stupid.
That is first sign of a egoistical person.

00:17:21.637 --> 00:17:26.652
He is so stupid that when you are talking to him,
you just get flabbergasted

00:17:26.853 --> 00:17:30.832
that without paying anything you have got a buffoon before you

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:36.245
who is showing all joke, jokes of his buffoonery.

00:17:36.446 --> 00:17:40.960
Is something very surprising,
I mean, you meet any egoistical person

00:17:41.162 --> 00:17:46.672
and you just watch him: “I did this, I am, I, I, I ...”

00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:52.361
Then you start seeing the person,
what’s the matter, he’s not even ashamed to say

00:17:52.562 --> 00:17:58.847
things that should not be said.
Then it goes even to the sinful life they lead.

00:17:59.048 --> 00:18:04.973
They lead a very sinful life, they fond of women,
they drink and this and that.

00:18:05.174 --> 00:18:09.676
Then they start boasting about that also:
“I drank that day so much;

00:18:09.877 --> 00:18:14.282
I had five women around me.” They start boasting of that also.

00:18:14.483 --> 00:18:18.685
So, for a egoistical man there is nothing like shame.

00:18:18.886 --> 00:18:21.744
He’ll go on telling about his nonsensical things

00:18:21.945 --> 00:18:25.584
and everybody will say, ‘My God, with whom are we talking?’

00:18:25.785 --> 00:18:30.715
And then, whatever they do they justify.

00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:33.844
I asked one fellow, "You had such a bad heart attack.

00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:36.840
Why do you drink now, give up drinking."

00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:40.891
He said, "But even this person Kirloskar” - we have one in Poona

00:18:41.092 --> 00:18:47.029
who is now, I think, 95 – “he drinks”.
So I said, "You are not Kirloskar,

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.380
and even if he drinks, what’s the use, what is he gaining by that?"

00:18:51.581 --> 00:18:57.850
"No, no, you see he’s very good,
because, see, he drinks and he’s so successful."

00:18:58.028 --> 00:19:01.779
"Is he successful without, because of drinking?"

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:07.341
But even ordinary reasoning is not there, ordinary reasoning.

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:14.663
And in the general way if you see,
even if you see the greatest drunkard countries,

00:19:14.864 --> 00:19:20.554
I have never seen a statue of a man who died of drinking, never.

00:19:20.755 --> 00:19:23.660
I’ve not seen in any country people are praising a man

00:19:23.861 --> 00:19:30.174
because he had ten women or he died of drinking. So far!

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:34.409
I don't know how far human beings can go in their ego.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.121
Now this ego is spreading very much in modern times

00:19:38.322 --> 00:19:45.760
where they start saying, "I like this, I don't like this".

00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:50.606
“What, what you don't like?” "I don't like this kind of a sari,

00:19:50.807 --> 00:19:53.946
I don't like this kind of clothes, I don't like this."

00:19:54.147 --> 00:19:57.935
But who are you, you are not going to see yourself,
others are going to see.

00:19:58.136 --> 00:20:01.009
So what difference does it make whether you like it or not?

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:06.379
But is very common with young people, to talk like that "I like."

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:10.892
And this is a sign of complete destruction.

00:20:11.093 --> 00:20:16.780
Because ego is not only, is, makes you stupid,

00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:19.592
you see all these days the way people dress up

00:20:19.793 --> 00:20:24.923
and we find they are very stupid because "I like it, so what?”

00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:29.108
Anything they like it, you know, if they want to walk on their heads

00:20:29.309 --> 00:20:32.560
"I like it, what’s wrong?”

00:20:32.886 --> 00:20:37.721
All kinds of stupidity can be explained through ego.

00:20:37.923 --> 00:20:45.168
So those who get Realization somehow or other, thank God, see it:

00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:49.212
This is my ego talking.

00:20:49.714 --> 00:20:55.922
Then they start laughing at themselves, making fun of themselves:

00:20:56.123 --> 00:21:02.238
This was my ego. But also in Sahaja Yoga there are people,

00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:06.991
I said, "Why don't you go and organize?"
"Mother, because my ego will come up."

00:21:07.192 --> 00:21:12.687
I said, "What’s this?” “My ego will come up so I don’t want to organize."

00:21:12.888 --> 00:21:19.227
How can your ego come up? If you see your ego, supposing you see,

00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:25.552
something is burning, you see it there.
How can you get that burning onto yourself?

00:21:25.753 --> 00:21:32.713
But this is a very subtle type of, avoiding work of Sahaja Yoga

00:21:32.914 --> 00:21:35.388
to say that "No, I’ll get into ego."

00:21:35.589 --> 00:21:40.728
I said, "All right you get into ego, I’ll see to it, get in, what happens."

00:21:41.424 --> 00:21:50.054
So all kinds of things there are which makes a person quite idiotic and stupid.

00:21:51.654 --> 00:21:57.307
I mean, I don't know how many things I can tell you today.

00:21:57.508 --> 00:22:02.613
But also I’ve seen in marriages this is very common.

00:22:02.814 --> 00:22:07.753
They’ll say that, ‘Mother, I married this girl at that time

00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:11.798
but now I don't think I should have been married.’

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:17.258
Bah, bah, what, that time, what had happened to you,
why didn't you marry at that time?

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.341
I have to tell you these things because I’ve been facing

00:22:20.542 --> 00:22:25.511
all kinds of problems of this stupid, idiotic ego.

00:22:26.467 --> 00:22:29.731
One has to see it clearly,

00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:36.044
how this ego is working in me and how it is keeping me down.

00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:41.150
So when we talk of ascent, we talk of a higher life.

00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:48.599
We have to become sanyasi like the lotus that comes out of the pond

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.344
and no water can stay on them.

00:22:53.756 --> 00:22:59.748
Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay on them.
Just like that we have to become.

00:22:59.949 --> 00:23:04.044
We don't have to wear sanyasis dresses, nothing of that.

00:23:04.245 --> 00:23:10.979
But from inside, a kind of a detached attention is there

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:18.653
which immediately locates the problem, within you and without.

00:23:18.854 --> 00:23:24.671
And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how to overcome that.

00:23:24.872 --> 00:23:34.293
It’s a very effective, efficient system.

00:23:34.642 --> 00:23:38.128
But for that again, to achieve that

00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:44.164
you have to become Shiva within, means detached.

00:23:44.365 --> 00:23:49.456
As Shiva is completely detached, you have to be detached.

00:23:49.657 --> 00:23:55.970
And that detachment will give you the same wisdom as Shiva has.

00:23:56.172 --> 00:24:04.890
Shiva sees, we should say, Sadashiva sees the work of Adi Shakti, silently.

00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:09.705
He doesn't get proud, He doesn't develop a kind of a ego

00:24:09.906 --> 00:24:17.791
‘Let me see now what my Iccha Shakti is doing’, nothing, He’s just watching.

00:24:18.105 --> 00:24:22.562
But when it comes to destruction,

00:24:22.763 --> 00:24:27.311
He sees that this part is going to destroy the work,

00:24:27.512 --> 00:24:32.447
immediately He destroys, removes that portion.

00:24:32.796 --> 00:24:41.603
In the same way we have to be,
we have to see our life itself is a big field.

00:24:41.804 --> 00:24:47.844
How do we consider ourselves to be?

00:24:48.122 --> 00:24:51.418
I have seen people talk, "Oh, so what, I am a Sahaja Yogi!"

00:24:51.641 --> 00:24:55.383
You can't talk like that if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:58.142 --> 00:25:03.145
With folded hands you have to say, “I am a Sahaja Yogi”.

00:25:03.597 --> 00:25:08.907
In your behavior, in your talk, in everything,

00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:16.318
you have to be a person who is extremely humble.

00:25:19.216 --> 00:25:26.755
If that is not so that means Sahaja Yoga has given you double ego.

00:25:27.923 --> 00:25:33.164
As it is you know that Shiva is known for His innocence,

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:38.225
for His simplicity, His forgiveness. He forgives.

00:25:38.426 --> 00:25:43.873
He forgives rakshasas; He’ll forgive everyone, that is His quality.

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:52.273
But anybody who goes against the Primordial Mother, He doesn't spare.

00:25:53.353 --> 00:25:57.270
So this is His, the quality one has to understand,

00:25:57.471 --> 00:26:01.123
surrendering doesn't mean outside things to be surrendered.

00:26:01.324 --> 00:26:06.050
What is there, these are all stones, what are you surrendering?

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:15.359
Surrendering means cleansing yourself completely,
getting completely detached.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.613
Detachment is the only way you can rise.

00:26:34.247 --> 00:26:37.661
Some people get sick, they make such an ado out of it:

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:43.262
“I am sick, the whole world should know
I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.”

00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:47.839
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you just watch,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.211
how so, I am sick, all right, let’s see.

00:26:52.545 --> 00:26:57.325
Just like a sport. Just watch.

00:26:58.296 --> 00:27:03.235
I am sick. So, what’s happening now?
The temperature is coming nicely,

00:27:03.436 --> 00:27:08.403
now is going down, you just sort of a

00:27:10.521 --> 00:27:14.615
playful, mirthful attention.

00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:20.669
Ah, when I came I had temperature,
but nobody believes I had temperature.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.672
I was so tired in the marriage they said, "You don’t look tired."

00:27:23.874 --> 00:27:31.368
I said, "All right, I’m not tired."
In the same way, life also is to be played.

00:27:31.569 --> 00:27:41.013
It’s just a play, and that play has to be seen
through the light of wisdom.

00:27:41.214 --> 00:27:46.330
Nothing is so serious, for Sahaja Yogis nothing is so serious.

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:54.975
But he becomes very serious and
he makes too much ado about himself.

00:27:55.961 --> 00:28:00.783
There are lots of things which we have to learn.

00:28:00.984 --> 00:28:06.636
When we worship Shiva, we praise Him.
You are this, you are that, you are that.

00:28:06.837 --> 00:28:09.728
When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this.

00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:13.120
I am not aware of all that that you say. But you say all right,

00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:16.599
if you say so, it’s all right. You are this, you are that,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.629
the thousand names of Shiva, thousand name of the Goddess,
thousand name of Vishnu.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:28.495
These are their names you are worshipping, what about you people,

00:28:29.154 --> 00:28:32.284
how many names you can have?

00:28:32.538 --> 00:28:38.151
Actually in the puja when you take the names of these Shaktis

00:28:38.352 --> 00:28:42.987
they also get awakened within, no doubt.

00:28:43.241 --> 00:28:49.780
After Puja you do feel that way but you don't utilize them.

00:28:50.471 --> 00:28:54.187
So many people I’ve seen have come in the puja

00:28:54.388 --> 00:29:02.316
and they have got that power within themselves, same powers.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:07.621
But by the time they are out, it’s finished, it’s gone.

00:29:07.822 --> 00:29:15.609
So, surrendering has another side: assumption.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:22.554
Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi

00:29:22.791 --> 00:29:28.819
and I can absorb all these powers within myself.

00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:33.040
So one side is surrendering.

00:29:33.453 --> 00:29:36.949
Why to surrender? To absorb.

00:29:38.283 --> 00:29:43.400
Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb.

00:29:44.395 --> 00:29:50.106
But once you have absorbed, then you should retain

00:29:50.307 --> 00:29:56.166
and assume within yourself, know that you have these powers.

00:29:57.264 --> 00:30:01.377
There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more.

00:30:01.578 --> 00:30:05.431
First time it happened, no Sahaja Yogi would touch anybody,

00:30:05.632 --> 00:30:08.108
raise anybody's Kundalini, this thing, that thing.

00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:11.839
We had at least fifty Sahaja Yogis by then.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.803
I said, "Now what to do, I have prepared these channels

00:30:15.004 --> 00:30:20.219
and nobody is even raising their fingers.
How am I going to work it out?"

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.988
Very difficult!

00:30:22.189 --> 00:30:28.216
But once it happened we had a program in Nasik Road
and I was staying in Nasik.

00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:32.269
It’s about, I think, thirty miles from there.

00:30:32.615 --> 00:30:37.368
So, we reached halfway and our car failed

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:43.127
and nobody, no other car was coming, nothing, no support, nothing.

00:30:44.423 --> 00:30:50.618
I didn't know what to do. But these, all the Sahaja Yogis had arrived there,

00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:54.291
and such a big crowd. They started saying, "When is Mataji coming?

00:30:54.492 --> 00:30:58.377
When is Mataji coming?" Such a pressure!

00:30:58.578 --> 00:31:01.717
So they said, "It’s all right, we’ll give you Realization, sit down."

00:31:01.918 --> 00:31:04.514
And they gave Realization.

00:31:04.715 --> 00:31:08.370
That’s the first time the Sahaja Yogis started knowing that they can

00:31:08.571 --> 00:31:12.740
give Realization, they can do this, they can do that.

00:31:12.994 --> 00:31:17.462
They all started after that.

00:31:17.663 --> 00:31:23.059
So assumption should be there, that I have these powers,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.848
I am not going to waste them, I am going to use them,

00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:31.821
I am going to look after others, I am not going to just keep to myself.

00:31:32.022 --> 00:31:37.431
This assumption has to come. Once I was traveling by ship

00:31:37.632 --> 00:31:43.206
and one fellow got caught up in the freeze room and he got pneumonia.

00:31:43.407 --> 00:31:47.397
So the captain came to Me ‘That see this boy has got pneumonia,

00:31:47.598 --> 00:31:50.151
we have to get some doctor by helicopter.’

00:31:50.352 --> 00:31:53.506
I said, "Captain, I’ve given you Realization, you are a doctor."

00:31:53.707 --> 00:31:57.254
He said "Who, I?” “Yes, you." "If you want, I can go down."

00:31:57.455 --> 00:32:00.278
"No, no, no, but tell me what to be done." I said "Just go

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.643
and put your hand on his heart, finished." "I" he said. "Yes, you!"

00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:12.876
Went down and put his hand and the fellow got all right.

00:32:13.315 --> 00:32:15.838
He was amazed.

00:32:16.784 --> 00:32:21.179
He met Me now in the wedding – and he was amazed at himself.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.302
"This I can do to anyone?" "Yes, yes, you can!”

00:32:26.056 --> 00:32:32.168
But if you do not assume, and just sit down meditating,
meditating, surrendering …

00:32:32.369 --> 00:32:35.200
what’s the use?

00:32:37.614 --> 00:32:41.842
So, you have to do,

00:32:42.342 --> 00:32:50.764
now after achieving Shiva state you have to
start doing the work of Adi Shakti.

00:32:52.473 --> 00:33:00.156
You should get this desire that we should spread Sahaja Yoga,
we have to work it out.

00:33:00.357 --> 00:33:03.505
But be careful sometimes you might be conditioned,

00:33:03.706 --> 00:33:06.531
you might be egotistical, watch yourself.

00:33:06.732 --> 00:33:11.226
With watching you can, I’m sure, you can achieve a lot.

00:33:11.427 --> 00:33:15.415
We have done, some people who have taken it upon themselves

00:33:15.616 --> 00:33:19.650
have done it, everywhere, in every country.

00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:24.921
So the first thing of surrendering is important

00:33:25.122 --> 00:33:30.168
to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva and Sadashiva.

00:33:30.369 --> 00:33:38.258
But the second state is that you have to now think of others.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.960
First it is as they say in Sanskrit is vyashti,

00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:47.600
means individual gain, you get the individual gain.

00:33:47.801 --> 00:33:54.457
And then it becomes samashti, means the collective.

00:33:54.658 --> 00:33:58.606
You have to work it out on collective.

00:33:59.035 --> 00:34:03.196
People who never even got Realization, nothing of the kind,

00:34:03.397 --> 00:34:07.358
have been doing so much organization and this and that.

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:11.952
While you have got everything, so now it is important

00:34:12.153 --> 00:34:17.750
that you should now extend this light to others.

00:34:31.175 --> 00:34:34.029
Forgive Me, I had to speak in English here.

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:39.211
Many people have come from outside for Shivji puja,

00:34:39.332 --> 00:34:41.532
it has never happened before.

00:34:42.018 --> 00:34:48.709
And about Shivji – you people know a lot.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:53.271
And all His stories also, you all know. But what is the substance?

00:34:53.861 --> 00:35:02.574
What is the essence? What is the essence of Shivji – you should know.

00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:09.004
About Shivji, nothing touches Him.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:14.312
If someone says anything to Him and then apologizes to Him,
He’ll say, “Alright go, you are forgiven”.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.053
Nothing touches Him.

00:35:16.192 --> 00:35:20.237
Praise/insult, happiness/ sorrow –

00:35:20.396 --> 00:35:22.771
nothing touches Him.

00:35:22.916 --> 00:35:28.469
He is Shivji, completely detached from everything – free.

00:35:28.991 --> 00:35:34.255
Like Adi Shankaracharya has told, ‘Shivoham, Shivoham’
[I am Shiva, I am Shiva].

00:35:34.483 --> 00:35:40.156
So first during the time of Adi Shankaracharya ‘Shivoham’
[I am Shiva] was talked about.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:46.655
It was being said, ‘I am Shiva’, alright.

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:55.955
To reach that state, it happens through individual endeavor.

00:35:57.194 --> 00:36:02.580
And after that the other state –

00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:08.703
the way Adi Shakti is working, like that you have to work.

00:36:09.074 --> 00:36:15.256
Otherwise if these two things don’t take place simultaneously,

00:36:15.444 --> 00:36:17.723
then what is the use of attaining Shiva’s state?

00:36:17.878 --> 00:36:19.545
They are sitting.

00:36:19.897 --> 00:36:25.784
If Shiva could do everything, then why did He create Adi Shakti?

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:30.409
Why did He tell Adi Shakti, ‘You create everything. You do that, you do this’?

00:36:30.639 --> 00:36:33.450
He could do everything, but no.

00:36:33.682 --> 00:36:36.856
He told, ‘there is one state – ‘Shiva’s state’.

00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:43.268
On reaching the Shiva’s state you become completely desire less’.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.893
Then whatever you do; now I see that some people say,

00:36:46.988 --> 00:36:52.911
“Mother there is one person in Sahaja Yoga and he is laundering money”.

00:36:53.206 --> 00:36:55.121
I don’t understand,

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.923
“After coming to Sahaja Yoga, how are they laundering money?”

00:36:59.028 --> 00:37:02.623
Someone is there who is showing his ego, his position.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.039
Some or the other crazy things,

00:37:05.111 --> 00:37:07.563
even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they are continue doing.

00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:10.857
Something must be stuck to them, it’s possible.

00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:12.554
But they should get rid of it.

00:37:12.839 --> 00:37:17.678
So when you have come to Sahaja Yoga first you attain Shiva’s state.

00:37:18.234 --> 00:37:21.877
Meaning in which you are completely desire less.

00:37:22.289 --> 00:37:24.306
For that surrender,

00:37:24.438 --> 00:37:28.021
after complete surrendering you can come in Shiva Shakti.

00:37:28.293 --> 00:37:32.520
Shiva’s Shakti is that He is absolutely detached.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:37.691
Nothing influences Him. He neither has ego,

00:37:37.912 --> 00:37:42.291
nor does He have refinement.

00:37:43.355 --> 00:37:48.319
He came for His wedding sitting on a Bull.

00:37:48.525 --> 00:37:54.189
He is spreading His legs and sitting and the Bull is running and
He is just holding one to it somehow and coming.

00:37:54.392 --> 00:37:57.261
On reaching there,

00:37:57.792 --> 00:38:01.687
even Parvathi was feeling shy, ‘What is this?
My Groom is arriving like this?’

00:38:01.767 --> 00:38:04.430
What difference does it make to Him?

00:38:04.592 --> 00:38:06.581
He doesn’t want that He sits on a horse

00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:09.573
and goes in a ‘Baraat’ [marriage procession] proceeding Him.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:14.053
In the ‘Baraat’ someone has one eye,
[marriage procession of the groom]

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:16.251
someone’s teeth have fallen.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.972
He is taking such people and going.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.997
For Him, he doesn’t even realize these things –

00:38:25.143 --> 00:38:28.058
who is what? Who is wearing what clothes?

00:38:28.284 --> 00:38:30.301
Whose eye is where?

00:38:30.394 --> 00:38:32.591
How a person is accompanying dumbly,

00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:35.113
some stupid person is accompanying,

00:38:35.193 --> 00:38:39.435
some half-naked person is walking along –

00:38:39.658 --> 00:38:41.847
these things don’t matter to Him.

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:45.535
He is desire less, however you are come along.
Whoever is coming along can.

00:38:45.681 --> 00:38:48.311
Otherwise when we go in a ‘baraat’ we have to wear such

00:38:48.338 --> 00:38:53.329
and such clothes, we have to go like this,
have to sit on a horse etc. etc.

00:38:53.395 --> 00:38:58.494
And if there is ever a small short fall,
then it causes lot of unpleasantness. He’s not like that.

00:38:58.639 --> 00:39:02.402
He is going in His Baraat accompanied by people however they are.

00:39:02.567 --> 00:39:06.588
Because this is the sign of desirelessness and He is innocent.

00:39:06.835 --> 00:39:10.033
Innocent because unwanted things don’t come in His head.

00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:14.098
A person who is innocent doesn’t understand these things.

00:39:14.691 --> 00:39:17.905
I have seen that many people when they go to someone’s place –

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.400
‘what carpet has been laid?’

00:39:21.495 --> 00:39:25.046
Have you gone to meet the carpet or the person?

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.801
Some lady comes – ‘what saree was she wearing?’

00:39:28.937 --> 00:39:36.436
You have come to meet the person, you go to the substance,
go to the essence and understand what the person is.

00:39:36.595 --> 00:39:37.985
That part is ignored.

00:39:38.072 --> 00:39:43.820
Just what they were wearing? What is in their house?
It was like this, like that.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:51.231
This kind of sight – just looking at things
superficially is not Shiva’s way.

00:39:53.064 --> 00:39:57.528
Now just see Him in His own life – He went and sat in the Himalaya.

00:39:58.525 --> 00:40:00.918
He is not bothered about anything –

00:40:01.068 --> 00:40:03.928
‘What if someone says something, I have to be like this,

00:40:04.405 --> 00:40:09.071
I have to have this thing or that thing’ – nothing.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:17.683
When His first wife died, He carried Her body on His back and went.

00:40:17.761 --> 00:40:20.515
Who will do that? No one will do that.

00:40:22.242 --> 00:40:26.176
All His methods are special, exceptional. Because He is exceptional.

00:40:26.946 --> 00:40:34.561
About anything He doesn’t have a fixed criteria
that it has to be like this only or like that only.

00:40:35.448 --> 00:40:40.799
But if you look at the essence then
what according to Him is right,

00:40:41.179 --> 00:40:44.915
only that He feels is right.

00:40:45.685 --> 00:40:51.352
What according to Him is wrong, is wrong.
These convictions of His does not change.

00:40:52.587 --> 00:40:58.619
He even gave His wife to Ravana.

00:40:58.785 --> 00:41:04.235
Now people will say, ‘What is this drama –
giving away His wife to Ravana?’

00:41:04.689 --> 00:41:09.097
He knows His wife is a Devi, what can Ravana do?

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:16.585
To whomever He gives, She is Sakshat Devi.
She will set Him right – Ravan.

00:41:17.806 --> 00:41:20.857
Our character of seeing everything externally;

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:23.114
as the external ‘eye’ [seeing] decreases,

00:41:23.274 --> 00:41:29.201
the inner ‘eye’ [seeing] opens. However the person is.

00:41:30.861 --> 00:41:37.230
For ourselves it is alright that we behave properly, that we talk properly.

00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:43.799
But however is the other person, understand his essence.

00:41:43.954 --> 00:41:45.762
How is the inside of the person?

00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:49.998
Some rural people are there, while talking they talk roughly.

00:41:50.918 --> 00:41:55.781
Someone’s speech is like, someone is like this. We get angry on them.

00:41:56.299 --> 00:42:00.542
We should think ‘that is his way, alright that is also fine,

00:42:00.941 --> 00:42:03.582
there is nothing to feel bad about’.

00:42:03.761 --> 00:42:06.673
When civilized people come

00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:12.637
and you get carried away by etiquette
and realize we have lost everything with them.

00:42:12.955 --> 00:42:19.173
So whatever is made beautiful on the outside is only for cheating.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:23.105
That’s why regarding any exterior stuff,

00:42:23.523 --> 00:42:27.432
getting attached to it, seeing it, is wrong.

00:42:27.725 --> 00:42:34.723
Now the kind of things happening in the world, especially in our country.

00:42:35.002 --> 00:42:44.174
The outside culture that is coming in, so much of external appearance.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:48.789
If it was not there, people would not be like this.

00:42:49.292 --> 00:42:53.973
Gandhiji was there – poor man, he wore a dhoti and went to London.

00:42:55.602 --> 00:43:02.059
Now someone tells him ‘in London you have to wear 3 piece suit and go,

00:43:03.232 --> 00:43:05.586
how did you come like this?’

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:09.630
He went. Let people say whatever they want to.

00:43:09.773 --> 00:43:15.665
Only thing you need to pay attention is that
if someone is dressing up like that for fun then it’s something else.

00:43:16.148 --> 00:43:24.579
But once the person is free from inside,
then he does not find anything significant other than the reality.

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:30.925
He will accept the reality –
this is essence of Shivji you should first achieve.

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:35.203
Only when you achieve Shivji’s essence,

00:43:35.357 --> 00:43:38.592
only then you can do the work of Adi Shakti.

00:43:39.304 --> 00:43:43.416
Now you start working out but have not achieved Shivji’s essence.

00:43:43.712 --> 00:43:47.177
Then who will be influenced by it?

00:43:47.412 --> 00:43:56.996
You yourself are ‘Shiva’ and then the work being done by you,

00:43:57.266 --> 00:43:59.117
it can be so wonderful.

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:03.680
Someone says something, even hurls abuses, did something –

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.070
so what?

00:44:07.848 --> 00:44:10.632
The word for this is as told by Shri Krishna –
‘Sthita Pragya’ [steady in awareness].

00:44:10.732 --> 00:44:14.909
Whatever is happening, let it happen.

00:44:15.177 --> 00:44:19.679
Just because someone says something, so what?

00:44:19.782 --> 00:44:22.425
But the essence that is within, has to be clean.

00:44:22.598 --> 00:44:25.599
The essence inside should not be spoilt.

00:44:26.082 --> 00:44:31.648
And in others if it is spoilt, it’s not a problem, it can be set right.

00:44:33.638 --> 00:44:40.286
If you tell bad things about others but not about yourself,
then you cannot become alright.

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:47.740
The meaning of surrendering is that
whatever such things are there within us –

00:44:47.912 --> 00:44:51.484
forsake them, forsake them, forsake them.

00:44:52.093 --> 00:44:59.727
In the end the cleanliness and purity within you which is your Spirit,

00:45:00.877 --> 00:45:05.782
just by seeing it you will be joyous.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:16.902
And that will make you completely capable that you will be astonished,

00:45:19.076 --> 00:45:22.682
‘from where did I get this ability?’

00:45:23.344 --> 00:45:30.119
Today Shivji’s puja has to take place and it is taking place

00:45:32.536 --> 00:45:35.536
and you people are also completely surrendered.

00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:42.695
The other side of surrendering is that the way we have received it,

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.766
we are Self-Realized.

00:45:45.919 --> 00:45:54.104
We are one in a million who have been given this blessing.

00:45:58.337 --> 00:46:03.497
‘How much can we work towards it?

00:46:03.656 --> 00:46:08.497
How much can we achieve?” – you should think like that.

00:46:08.954 --> 00:46:15.053
As it is you people are beyond My imagination.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:23.932
I had never thought so much of change can come in people.

00:46:24.605 --> 00:46:27.350
Never had I thought.

00:46:27.482 --> 00:46:32.599
As per that, so much of work has happened in
the whole world that I am surprised.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:38.409
And it needs to be understood that people
who were in the wrong path

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.537
who were going towards their destruction,

00:46:41.652 --> 00:46:46.291
they have come up and today they are with us.

00:46:46.622 --> 00:46:52.486
It’s such a big thing that the reflection of Shiva in you

00:46:53.796 --> 00:46:57.426
which is in the form of Atma, this is a great blessing of it.

00:46:57.568 --> 00:47:02.136
All of you are flooded with this blessing, you just have to spread it.

00:47:02.294 --> 00:47:09.061
Spread it by surrendering and collectively spread it.

00:47:09.314 --> 00:47:16.297
It is not for one person, nor for one rising but for everyone’s upliftment.

00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:27.087
The brink at which our world is standing now, we have to save it.

00:47:27.292 --> 00:47:32.482
We have to save it completely and this is your responsibility

00:47:32.692 --> 00:47:36.628
those who are Sahaja Yogis, who in their life, within them,

00:47:37.048 --> 00:47:43.118
in their behavior, in everything, should know how to look for ‘Sahaja’.

00:47:44.484 --> 00:47:48.285
Many blessings to all of you.
