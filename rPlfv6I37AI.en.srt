1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:21,960
Today is the happiest day for all of you,

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,640
for the whole universe,

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,800
because Shri Ganesha was created.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,800
He was created to emit auspiciousness

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,400
through His Chaitanya [Divine Vibrations].

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,440
First, the whole cosmos was filled

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,640
with this Chaitanyasrishti [creation of Divine Vibrations].

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,480
Then Brahmadeva came into play,

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,360
and He created all the matter.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,480
But the greatest blessings

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,400
of the Divine Power

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,280
was to symbolize Chaitanya,

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,840
and this Chaitanya has many aspects,

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
but specially in Shri Ganesha,

15
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,720
it is auspiciousness.

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,120
In these modern times people have lost the sense of auspiciousness.

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,960
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya, is auspicious,

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:09,760
is shubh, and whatever does not is not by any chance auspicious.

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,760
So first of all, whatever you worship,

20
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,560
whatever you accept,

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,120
all of them have to be auspicious things.

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,200
Every shape has a coefficience

23
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,920
and all these shapes which you see,

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,440
not necessarily give vibrations.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,920
But in the human beings also,

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,680
we find there are many people, like you,

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,280
who have Chaitanya flowing in them.

28
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,000
But this Chaitanya when it flows,

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,840
we just take Shri Ganesha for granted.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,320
We do not understand

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,160
that we have to awaken Shri Ganesha within us.

32
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,360
Means what? What we have to do?

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,520
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in you

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,960
and as I said that innocence cannot be lost,

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,920
so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal child,

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,600
He cannot be lost and He cannot be destroyed.

37
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,640
So He’s all the time there.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,920
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,760
the great personality of innocence.

40
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,280
But it is always there present.

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
So now, what should we do

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,960
to keep this Ganesha all the time shining within us?

43
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,720
Is to first remember that you were made in the same pattern

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,520
as Shri Ganesh.

45
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,200
But His Kundalini is on His stomach;

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,360
His pure desire is on His stomach.

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,480
It’s very significant to understand

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,480
why it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,320
That means He does not have to conquer

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,040
the temptations of Mooladhara at all.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,400
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach,

52
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:42,680
that means He is also beyond the temptations of food,

53
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,440
of power or anything

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,800
because His stomach represents

55
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,040
absolute abandonment, absolute freedom.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,280
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…

57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,440
these days there is a big fashion that you cannot have a big belly.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:16,240
I mean this is becoming a big, not only fashion, but a big business.

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,040
But as age grows, you have to have it.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,800
Even small children have that and they look so sweet.

61
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,880
Those people who are very thin must understand

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,760
that they might be getting some prizes

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,880
in the maybe beauty contest or something,

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,960
but they do not have that majesty,

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,080
that royalty, that dignity in them

66
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,680
as they should have.

67
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,320
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:05,040
He has a head with a trunk.

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,680
He accepts it.

70
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
Of course, is important, He should have that.

71
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,960
Because head of the elephant suggests

72
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,440
that He is not like a human being

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,280
who develops ego, superego, conditionings, but

74
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,960
He is just all the time one with the Divine.

75
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,440
He accepts His ears,

77
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,160
He accepts everything that He is made of.

78
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,400
He doesn’t aspire to something

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,720
some entrepreneurs put some ideas

80
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,200
and He wouldn’t go run after them.

81
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,760
He won’t try to change Himself;

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,240
He won’t try to create that fashion and all that.

83
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,720
He is what He is.

84
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,800
Because He is a satisfied soul.

85
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,040
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,

86
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,640
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri Ganesha.

87
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,040
When you have all the powers within you,

88
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,280
you know you are powerful,

89
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,720
then you don’t hanker after all these things

90
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,680
and you don’t try to make a position

91
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,600
or an impression of others.

92
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,360
For example, He would never go and read books like

93
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,200
how to impress people.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,640
Very common.

95
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,840
So now, as you are created in the same image of Shri Ganesh,

96
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
you have to understand that you have to accept

97
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,280
whatever God has given you,

98
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
whatever position He has given you.

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,640
Same with Christ.

100
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,880
Christ accepted His father who was just a carpenter.

101
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,520
He didn’t aspire for something higher

102
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,600
or some sort of a special position

103
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,400
or a power because He was so powerful

104
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,640
what more power can He have?

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,440
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at Him

106
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,680
and could not accept what He was saying,

107
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,280
but still He was self-contented,

108
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,360
self-satisfied.

109
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,880
He knew what it was.

110
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,000
So, for a Sahaja Yogi

111
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,520
first thing is to be self-contented.

112
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,480
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western life is

113
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,640
to see and to be seen.

114
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,480
Both things were missing completely

115
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,000
in the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

116
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,840
So when I say these things, suddenly people start thinking,

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,280
“Let us become hippies,

118
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
or let them become punks,

119
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,800
or let us become this, let us become that.”

120
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,440
You don’t have to become anything. Whatever you have

121
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,920
your body, your face, your hair, everything is there,

122
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,880
just meant for you.

123
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,400
You don’t have to change anything outwardly

124
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,480
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

125
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,120
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

126
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Though there were so many clouds on His being,

127
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,160
though many people insulted Him,

128
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,720
tortured Him, hanged Him, crucified Him,

129
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,360
still the Eternal Being didn’t bother.

130
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,880
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja Yogi

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,720
is to accept,

132
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,040
go on accepting things.

133
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,760
But when I say accept, I must say the other side also:

134
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,160
that doesn’t mean you start accepting bhoots,

135
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,280
all the bad qualities of others.

136
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,080
“Mother, You said you must accept”,

137
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,040
so they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

138
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,440
“What’s wrong? You have said it already.”

139
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,240
Whatever I say has another side, always.

140
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,760
Like I said, “Now you have become your own Guru.”

141
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,080
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

142
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,360
Like this, you see,

143
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,720
we go on diverting ourselves,

144
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,720
deviating ourselves from reality

145
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,200
just to cheat ourselves.

146
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,800
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

147
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,240
We have no wisdom because we do not know what is for our benevolence,

148
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,120
what is for our good,

149
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,840
what we should do for our good.

150
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,000
and even if we know, we don’t want to do it.

151
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,160
So, what we lack is wisdom.

152
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,480
That’s a vicious circle, I must say,

153
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,440
that Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

154
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,880
He is the giver of wisdom,

155
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,440
He is the giver of wisdom

156
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,240
and He has to give you the wisdom,

157
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,000
He is to be awakened;

158
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,520
but you are not wise because He is not awakened.

159
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,440
It’s a very vicious circle.

160
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,200
How to make this vicious circle break?

161
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,240
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

162
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

163
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,920
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

164
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:05,560
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

165
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,880
That’s the point where you could see yourself, introspection,

166
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,440
which I have seen among Russians.

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,880
Just introspect:

168
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,280
“Why do I do like that?

169
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,640
Why cannot I meditate?

170
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,040
Am I going to miss out?

171
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:43,360
Why can I not do something that is good for me?”

172
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,640
Introspection is the only way

173
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,280
you can see yourself

174
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,520
how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

175
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,120
Even, I have seen, when I say something

176
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,600
in general, people always,  the mind is very clever

177
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,840
think that I am talking about somebody else,

178
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,600
not about them.

179
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,280
It’s a convex mind, convex,

180
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,480
which never receives anything inside itself

181
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,240
because there is no wisdom.

182
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,360
If you are wise,

183
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,200
then not only that you’ll accept

184
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,720
but you’ll understand and it will penetrate

185
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,600
into your attention through your central nervous system.

186
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,240
You just know that this is it.

187
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,280
Now you know that you put your hand towards this candle,

188
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,480
it… you’ll… your fingers might burn.

189
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,240
You know it definitely, with experience,

190
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,240
and you won’t do that.

191
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,920
With experience you have learnt

192
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,520
not to put your hand on to the candle.

193
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,560
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to tell you that.

194
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,680
But this is a new life you have started, a spiritual life.

195
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,640
When you are going into the spiritual life,

196
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,560
try to remember your experiences,

197
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,520
one after another:

198
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,640
how you got transformed, how you changed,

199
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,480
how many the bad things that you had disappeared gradually

200
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,280
and how you have become so nice.

201
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,080
This will take away your depression, to begin with.

202
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
Then you should think that, “What do I have to do further?

203
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,640
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

204
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,520
There are lots of stages between

205
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,800
absolute stupidity and absolute wisdom,

206
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,120
and you see all those shades all over,

207
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,120
and combinations and permutations of these I see every day.

208
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,200
And I am surprised that

209
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,360
after getting your Self Realization,

210
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,400
when Shri Ganesha is shining in your attention,

211
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,720
you should see your reflection clearly and try to correct it.

212
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,200
Only this much wisdom if you have that,

213
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,760
“I have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll do it.

214
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,960
I know of somebody who would never get up in the mornings,

215
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,440
say for example.

216
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,680
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock in the morning

217
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,320
I was surprised.

218
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,280
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline

219
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,520
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready to go somewhere.

220
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,560
I said, “Where are you going?”

221
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,640
“You don’t know?”

222
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I said, “What?”

223
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,680
“I have got a job now

224
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,760
and I have to be present at 8 o’clock

225
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,720
and it will take two hours to reach that place.

226
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,360
Also, I am keeping some margin. So I have to leave now.

227
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,680
I can’t talk to You even.”

228
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,920
Quite alert, awake.

229
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,880
Now, what is the thing is

230
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:42,040
as far as money is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

231
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

232
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,200
Money wisdom is quite a lot,

233
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,640
job wisdom is quite a lot.

234
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,720
Because these things means prestige in the society,

235
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,600
this means security in the society.

236
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,840
So this kind of business you find in many people

237
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
and in some even that is missing.

238
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,600
They don’t even understand that they have to earn their living.

239
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,360
But that’s the minimum,

240
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
you cannot be parasite.

241
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,240
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages, is this:

242
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,040
that we are not for money, money is for us.

243
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,600
The attention if it is on your Spirit,

244
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,960
on the Ganesha Principle,

245
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,080
then whole situation will change.

246
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,360
Your priorities will change.

247
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,120
And suddenly people will say,

248
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
“Mother, what has happened to this gentleman?

249
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,440
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such a wise person.”

250
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,880
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have minimum wisdom already there.
