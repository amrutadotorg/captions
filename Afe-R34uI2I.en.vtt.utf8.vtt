00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:29.730
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:40.750
You have just now heard that within us lies
the power of our ascent, ascent to the Divine.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.230
Now maybe there are some people who can say
"How?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.140
How do You say that?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.790
What's Your authority?"

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.839
Naturally, one can ask such a question.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:09.549
But as a scientist we have to keep our minds
open to any knowledge.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.450
I say this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.140
Why?

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.750
Whatever we have known so far is the knowledge
of the tree.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:29.940
It sounds fantastic sometimes to people how
can the awakening of the Kundalini or the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.560
Holy Ghost as described in the Bible can bring
forth this tremendous change; this transformation

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:50.630
and all the benefits of physical, mental,
emotional and material being within us.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.800
It's impossible to believe because it's too
fantastic.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.720
But we don't realize that how fantastically
we are made by God Almighty.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.790
We take Him so much for granted.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.300
When we make a computer in this world we feel
we have done a great job.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:26.299
But do you know you yourself you are a computer
which knows without thinking.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.150
I see you and I know I see you.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.720
I don't have to go back to some sort of a
programming to find out what am I seeing;

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.950
is also spontaneous and living.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.890
All the living things are created by the living
God and then we know that we have come to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:57.630
this stage of human awareness; from here if
we have to ascend, there must be some method,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.440
mechanism within us.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.130
Now some may say that why should we seek.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.880
There's no why about it.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.770
Because you see the confusion all along, you
see what's happening to people.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.380
There are so many thought waves coming up
like 'we must look after our health', 'we

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.040
must look after our mind'.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:32.760
There are so many sorts of theologies and
also many intellectual expositions and manifestations;

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.840
that one gets absolutely confounded and can't
understand where are we.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.510
Naturally in this confusion one feels very
frustrated and wants to find out what are

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.030
we here for?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.330
Any intelligent sincere person, honest person
thinks that way.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.330
'Why am I here?'

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:04.260
Of course for the frivolous, they can manage
for some time.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:13.190
They can continue for one or two lives till
they become little bit concerned but normally

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:21.449
any intelligent person would think that I
have been made a human being for what?

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:30.849
What is the purpose of my being a human being
from the animal stage?

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:38.139
Then people say that you are a human being
now you forget about your creator; you forget

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.380
about anything like that and you think you
are the creator.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.499
You just believe that you are the one who
has to rule the whole world.

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:54.289
That's how we create a barrier between ourselves
and the truth.

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.939
The truth exists and God exists whether we
believe in it or not.

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.130
Actually blind faith is not going to take
us to God.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.150
The faith has to be based on experience which
is called as 'shraddha'.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.820
It has to be based on experience of the truth.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:22.339
Supposing, I have not been to this room; I
have not seen it; I don't know what it is

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:26.470
and I started describing it and if you believe
Me, then I would say it's just a brain wash

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.300
and it has been nothing but a talk and talk
and talk about God throughout.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:43.349
The reason was the human beings were not ready
at that time I should say to get to their

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.349
Realization.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:59.349
We had few people very few in the last say
sixth to the modern times.

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:04.379
I asked a Zen master, "How many realized souls
you had?

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.379
'Kashyapas'"

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:12.080
And he said, "We had altogether only twenty
four 'Kashyapas' from the sixth Century to

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.099
the thirteenth Century and we had none."

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.979
So I said, "Then what are you doing there?

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.220
You are a Zen Master and you are not a realized
soul."

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.210
So he said, "I am doing my job."

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:33.059
A priest, I must say John Clover is also a
priest; and a priest very well known personality

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:38.039
and I asked him, "What do you mean by Holy
Ghost?"

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:43.160
So he says, "I am agnostic."

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.850
I said, "Then, what are you doing in the church?"

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.840
So he says "I am doing my job."

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.840
I was surprised!

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.449
What sort of a job you can do when you do
not know what you are talking?

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.520
You are professing something about which you
yourself are not sure.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.810
You yourself you are not a free soul and you
are talking about freedom of the soul; is

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.860
something like a advertising department.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.429
So people start wondering, is there anything
like God?

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:26.300
And no wonder that so many have discarded
as nothing.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.889
But the time has come now to prove the existence
of God.

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:40.169
The time has now come to prove all the miracles
of the scriptures.

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:45.099
At this time only there's a controversy should
come up that there were no miracles and the

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:46.960
time has come to prove that.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.539
Isn't it surprising that spontaneously at
this time only all these intellectuals are

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:59.099
coming out with their novel ideas?

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:05.030
And that this is the time we can prove it
that there is God.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:11.430
We can prove it that there is Kundalini, the
Holy Ghost and we can prove it that there

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:18.539
is Spirit and that a human being can ascend.

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:27.819
I think the background is so dark that the
light will show better and that has to happen.

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:42.709
In these modern times, I find if you talk
to anybody about God, they will laugh at you.

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:53.030
Is not regarded fashionable to talk about
God but despite of all that in the modern

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.090
times we have the maximum numbers of seekers.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.120
We never had so many seekers at any time.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:10.590
Think of Christ, he had those twelve disciples
who did not believe in Him till they saw His

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.590
resurrection.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.520
I mean they did not believe in Him fully,
I mean to say.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.840
Look at Buddha or look at anyone of these
people.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.440
Mohammad Saab, how they tortured his life?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:35.900
And they all have talked about this time as
the resurrection time because before the doomsday

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.160
the resurrection has to come.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:46.250
But the people who are in-charge of the, there
are people who have taken their charge in

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.250
this world.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:53.240
Will not believe that there can be redemption,
that there could be resurrection because it's

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.830
a money making proposition.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:09.210
I met a Mayor today in the morning of another
place and he told Me, he asked Me actually

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:14.150
"Why people become so fanatic about religion?"

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:21.620
I said, "Because it is a money making proposition
everywhere".

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.570
Any money making proposition has to be fanatic
because you have to be successful money wise

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.360
and also compromising.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:37.530
It's an enterprise and God doesn't understand
money, that's the worst part of it.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.970
He doesn't know what money is.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:53.160
He does all that is living what human beings
do is nothing but they convert dead to another

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.740
dead.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:02.150
Now for example some tree is dead, we make
a bench out of it; from dead to dead.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.880
But can we transform these flowers into fruits?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.440
We do not.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:20.990
And the one who does billions and billions
of these at the time, at the right time, proper

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:28.950
seasons, who must be that?

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:36.190
Whatever we have done so far is the dead work.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:44.000
But the work of God is the living work and
the living work of God is evident in our own

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.330
existence that we have become human beings
from amoeba stage and that if higher ascent

00:11:52.330 --> 00:12:01.530
has to take place it has to take place through
some spontaneous happening meaning living

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:10.260
happening not by some artificial things like
in the Hindu religion we have a ceremony called

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:17.380
as 'munja' where the, at eight years of age
they say the child has now become a Brahmin,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:24.950
means he has known the all pervading power
of Brahma, of Holy Ghost, certified.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:30.880
As we have in Christian religion also in the
churches they'll put their hand and your head

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.340
and say now you have become Christian, Baptized.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.650
How Sir?

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.510
Just an exercise and we believe in it.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:50.010
We accept the situation and we believe that
we are that.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:55.470
Mohammad Saab has said, "You have to become
the Pir."

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:02.690
There's no religion which has not said that
human awareness is for just balancing yourself.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.780
That's the religion is.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:10.371
It's like trial and error and trial and error;
that you make mistakes improve yourself, make

00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:12.040
mistakes improve yourself.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:18.590
You move from one extreme to another as you
see here to the left or to the right and then

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:27.860
you come to the center and the central path
of ascent is within us and which we achieve

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:35.780
through our moderation and not through our
extremes and those who go to extremes and

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:45.610
become fanatic are people who are not religious
by any chance because religion must give you

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.610
a balance.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:55.860
That's the first thing one must attain, attain
through religion.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:05.970
Now within us lies the power of our ascent
and the path of our ascent and on this path

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:14.920
we have got different centers which represent
something very subtle within us.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:21.500
As I told you this is the knowledge of the
roots.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.150
Supposing a tree is sick we see the leaves
are falling.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.150
So we take one leaf.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:32.600
First of all once if we pluck it out it is
already finished.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:39.770
But even on the tree we try to inject something
to the leaf, does it reach the whole of the

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.770
tree?

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.200
It does not.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.200
If you have to cure that tree, you have to
go to the roots.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:55.700
In the same way within ourselves these centers
are placed and the root has to be awakened

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:04.540
so that it passes through all these centers,
enlightens all these centers and give you

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:13.840
the ultimate that we call as the true Baptism
or Self Realization or in Sanskrit knowledge

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.029
they say 'Atma Sakshathkar'.

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:20.610
Now where does the Spirit reside?

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.750
The Spirit resides in our heart.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.110
Now this is a hypothesis for you.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.460
You need not accept.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.779
But keep your mind open for it.

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:35.830
But the seat of God almighty is on top of
your head though the reflection of that as

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.279
the Spirit is in the heart.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:45.510
When this Kundalini which is called as the
Root also or is called as the Holy Ghost,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:51.640
which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,
which is the power of God, which is the Primodial

00:15:51.640 --> 00:16:05.050
Mother, which is your individual Mother rises
and when it touches that point the Spirit

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.080
in your heart starts emitting these cool vibrations.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:17.100
First you feel it here coming out of your
head, the Cool Breeze.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.100
This happens.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:26.130
This is not artificial you can even see in
many people the pulsation of the Kundalini

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:32.861
very clearly just like a heart or in that
bone, which is just a bone; pulsates like

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:40.589
a heart, when there is an obstruction in the
higher centers.

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:49.880
Now the subtle side of these centers are that
the first center is related to our innocence.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:59.900
Have we bothered to find out how are we innocent
in our childhood?

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:06.420
What is that creates innocence within us?

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:16.390
Then the second center that we have is the
center of Swadishthana which deals with the

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.289
creativity that we have.

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:23.289
Now God has made human beings in his image.

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:29.590
He has the same centers within Him which He
reflects within us.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.879
So with this center He has created all this
universe.

00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:36.730
This is for the creativity.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:45.169
The third center within us, which is the naval
center, which looks after the solar plexus

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:52.880
on the gross, is called as the Nabhi Chakra
meaning the naval center and is responsible

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.200
for giving us the seeking.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:00.650
We should know why do we seek.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.379
Why do we seek food to begin with?

00:18:03.379 --> 00:18:10.100
We feel hungry, but how do we know that we
are hungry and that we want food?

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:15.460
Even a child knows that, even an animal knows
that; how?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:22.179
This is the center tells us that now you are
hungry better go and have some food.

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:30.950
And this is the center tells us now you better
seek some money, maybe some power, maybe all

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:37.860
the human things that we seek and waste our
life quite a lot in that.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:44.019
After that when you are affluent when you
have solved all these mundane things like

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:46.580
no more we are living in the jungles like
animals.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:53.049
Then we start thinking that there must be
something beyond because I have got everything

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:57.610
now but I haven't got joy.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.480
I don't feel joyous.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.749
I am not satisfied, what is that?

00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:10.559
When this seeking starts then you are a special
category of seekers for which William Blake

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:19.640
has clearly written very, very clearly two
hundred years back he said that men of God

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:27.149
will become prophets and they will have powers
to make others prophets and that is today's

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:28.429
Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:37.770
This seeking is a special category of people
who we find now a days all over the world.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:45.770
That's why I said it at the very outset that
you do not find so many seekers, in the history

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:49.410
of spirituality so many seekers.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:56.269
But today there are thousands and thousands;
I would say millions and millions of seekers.

00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:59.549
But what happens to them?

00:19:59.549 --> 00:20:04.690
Again they get lost.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:14.159
Some start getting lost in the intellectual
understanding of God, finished.

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:16.860
How can you understand God with this limited
brain?

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.840
He's unlimited.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.070
You have to go beyond this mind to understand.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:36.419
What can we understand of that God who does
all these marvelous things of living processes

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:43.369
which we cannot do even a wee bit with this
brain of ours?

00:20:43.369 --> 00:20:51.529
So some are lost in the books and some are
lost in the organized religions, finished.

00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:58.850
Sunday morning have a nice dress, go to the
church, I have done my work as far as God

00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.850
is concerned.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:08.470
Or I would say for a Hindu is to go to the
temple, take some money give it to the Brahmin

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.039
there, done.

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:14.600
So they are also lost in it.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.110
Then there are lots of markets now a days.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:30.489
We have 'spiritualists' and we have 'charismatics'
and we have got 'seventh day adventist' and

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.369
'born again'; all sorts.

00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:39.400
They are only same people with different brands.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:45.590
There's no difference between one human being
and another, even if you put any brand on

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.879
our head we are just the same.

00:21:47.879 --> 00:21:53.169
There is no difference at all.

00:21:53.169 --> 00:22:01.860
They may profess something, but whatever you
profess is not within you.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:08.640
So it is not what you profess is important,
but what you become.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.239
Becoming is the point.

00:22:13.239 --> 00:22:19.429
What you become on your central nervous system.

00:22:19.429 --> 00:22:21.769
That is the evolutionary impact.

00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:30.809
When we evolve from animal to human state
it is expressed on our central nervous system.

00:22:30.809 --> 00:22:37.919
For example if you have to take a dog through
a dirty lane, he has no objection, he just

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:39.200
walks through.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.369
But we cannot go.

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:46.499
Now you bring a dog here in a good garden,
he's quite happy, he doesn't know whether

00:22:46.499 --> 00:22:50.629
it is a beautiful garden of flowers or it's
a dirty lane.

00:22:50.629 --> 00:22:57.260
But for a human being this awareness is there
and he can feel it.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:02.769
Now to human beings if you talk of sin this
that, they don't understand.

00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:03.860
They'll say, "What's wrong?

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.860
What's wrong?"

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.049
"If I kill somebody what's wrong?"

00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:08.700
"If I do like this what's wrong?"

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:14.039
Because the awareness is at that level.

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:16.999
But Christ, would He do such a thing?

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:20.519
Buddha, would He do such a thing?

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:23.379
Khalil Gibran, would he do such a thing?

00:23:23.379 --> 00:23:25.899
William Blake?

00:23:25.899 --> 00:23:28.419
No, why?

00:23:28.419 --> 00:23:35.970
Because they are above us and their sense
and sensitivity has developed in such a manner

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:41.450
that they are the people who know what is
right and what is wrong.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.940
So we live in a relative world.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.570
We must accept this.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:52.409
We have no sense of absolute and even if we
have it is told to us from our fathers, forefathers

00:23:52.409 --> 00:23:58.990
or in the church or in the temple somewhere;
is all conditioning.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:08.509
We do not know for definite whether it is
right or wrong because we haven't got that

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:09.509
awareness.

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:18.399
So what has to happen to you is that you have
to become collectively conscious that means

00:24:18.399 --> 00:24:22.059
you can feel your own centers on your finger
tips.

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:29.960
That is Self-Realization, you know your Self
and you should feel the centers of other people

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:40.279
on your finger tips and so that you know what
is wrong with another person or what is wrong

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.279
with you.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:45.960
But you are so much separated from yourself
like it becomes your cloth, the whole body,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:53.629
the ego, the superego that you know it is
wrong and you clear it out, if you know the

00:24:53.629 --> 00:24:54.629
technique.

00:24:54.629 --> 00:24:58.030
This is the another meaning of the word Yoga.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:06.320
The first meaning is that Yoga is the union
with the Divine; also Yoga means to be deft

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:18.220
in the art of God's love, in the technique
of Divine laws; this is the another meaning.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.600
Yoga doesn't mean standing on your head.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:32.169
That's just a misnomer, because some people
have got very little knowledge about things

00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:35.150
and they start saying this is Yoga.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:41.049
But I mean Patanjali who has talked about
it thousands of years back has described nothing

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:49.860
but Sahaja Yoga; is the spontaneous union,
spontaneous union with the Divine.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:54.119
That's what he has described out and out but
who reads that big book.

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:59.490
Yoga you can buy in three pages you see.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:06.989
Stand on your head; bend your feet, but why?

00:26:06.989 --> 00:26:13.499
We too have to do some exercises in Sahaja
Yoga but the Kundalini has to rise and tell

00:26:13.499 --> 00:26:18.259
us where it is obstructed accordingly we do
the exercise.

00:26:18.259 --> 00:26:24.370
Supposing you have a trouble on your head
and you do the stomach exercises, the stomach

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.759
will be spoilt for nothing at all.

00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:31.389
As it is you have a headache plus the stomach
is also spoilt.

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:34.609
So it is a big science one has to understand.

00:26:34.609 --> 00:26:37.110
But it is so simple as a child.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:46.850
Now this child is a realized soul he knows
because you become the absolute.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:54.590
Now if you want to know whether there is God
or not you just put your hands like this and

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.570
ask the question, "Mother is there God?"

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:03.639
When you ask the question you'll get tremendous
Cool Breeze flowing.

00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:07.080
Is like a computer, an absolute computer.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.899
Now you ask a question, "Was Christ the son
of God?"

00:27:11.899 --> 00:27:17.889
You get tremendous; but ask about Rasputin
"Was he a saint?"

00:27:17.889 --> 00:27:26.789
I don't want to ask because it might burn
My hand.

00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:32.399
That's how you know the absolute.

00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:38.639
Afterwards you don't need also to use the
hands, just without that you know and that

00:27:38.639 --> 00:27:45.850
is what the state one has to achieve, that
is the final break-through we have to achieve

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:55.590
because this modern times as they say, these
are the times that are described as the resurrection

00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:06.279
time, the judgment time and this is the time
that people have to judge themselves.

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:09.210
Your own Spirit will judge you.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:15.350
Nobody is going to put you on a weighing machine
to see what have you got.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.989
Your own centers will be judged by you yourself.

00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:24.659
You become your own master, your own Guru
and you judge yourself and correct it.

00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:26.799
You judge others and correct it.

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:34.919
But you don't tell them, you speak in a strange
language as the disciples of Christ spoke.

00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:36.890
You talk in the language of centers.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.890
Like you ask somebody, "What's the matter
with this person?"

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:44.309
So he'll say, "His left Vishuddhi is catching."

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:46.519
Means he feels guilty.

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:51.100
If you feel guilty your left Vishuddhi catches.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:57.229
We went to Nottingham today and there was
a taxi fellow who came in.

00:28:57.229 --> 00:29:04.869
We sat in the car and I knew he was a realized
soul.

00:29:04.869 --> 00:29:06.120
And he started talking to Me.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:16.859
He also took to Me easily and he confessed
to Me, "Mother I am a healer."

00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:20.433
I knew he was a, everybody knew that he was
a realized soul.

00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:24.149
He did not know much about it because he's
not a Sahaja Yogi to know all the deftness

00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:25.149
of it.

00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:31.859
But he knew that he was something different
and a very gentle and a sweet personality

00:29:31.859 --> 00:29:33.100
he had.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.385
And while talking I asked him, "What's the
matter with you?

00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:35.385
Why do you feel so guilty?"

00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:38.860
He said, "I don't know but I feel like a criminal."

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.529
I said, "Why?"

00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:43.929
"Because everybody thinks I am queer."

00:29:43.929 --> 00:29:52.049
I said, "In a lunatic asylum if a saint man
goes everybody thinks that he is insane.

00:29:52.049 --> 00:29:56.720
So you must not feel that way, you should
have all full confidence in yourself."

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.509
But he was so surprised that I could tell
all these things about him.

00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:05.559
I said, "Anybody would say because we know
what you feel on your finger tips.

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:09.029
It's nothing great that we are doing."

00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:13.289
Because supposing, dog cannot talk to us,
but supposing we tell the dog that this is

00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:15.090
music, Indian music.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:21.720
He will ask, "How do you know it is Indian
music?"

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.721
Because we know, we can hear.

00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:26.230
You can't hear; you cannot differentiate.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:31.280
But we don't take such pride in saying that
we know this color or we know that thing and

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.570
we know what is art, what is not.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:38.049
We think it is our own right to know and we
know it.

00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:44.470
In the same way once you get your Realization
you just know it because you become.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:55.509
So becoming is the main thing that you become
a realized soul, a saint, a sage, a seer,

00:30:55.509 --> 00:31:02.700
but as a result of this awakening because
it passes through various centers, into various

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.700
layers.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:10.350
First thing that happens to you; first thing
I must say that you get your physical body

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.350
cured.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:16.649
That's how Sahaja Yoga cures cancer.

00:31:16.649 --> 00:31:19.019
What is so great about it?

00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:24.470
It does and it's only this Sahaja Yoga that
is going to cure cancer.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:28.580
Otherwise you'll take chemotherapy, loose
your hair, then they'll cut your throat and

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:36.419
cut your nose and you'll end up by parts,
you see and when one will die it won't be

00:31:36.419 --> 00:31:37.710
in one piece.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:44.669
But in Sahaja Yoga the Kundalini rises and
she supplies the necessary vital forces to

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:50.340
all these centers and you get cured.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:58.099
Practically everything that is to be repaired
can be repaired if the stage is not very much

00:31:58.099 --> 00:31:59.099
advanced.

00:31:59.099 --> 00:32:05.289
If the stage is very much advanced then the
Divine takes a decision that let this body

00:32:05.289 --> 00:32:09.669
die and come back again in a fresher way.

00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:14.779
Then it allows it to die.

00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:22.190
But mostly if it is in a repairing stage without
taking any medicine, without going to any

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:27.769
doctor, without anything you can cure yourself.

00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:31.840
It's not difficult.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:38.080
It transforms your personality in the sense
that your priorities change completely.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.179
I don't have to tell you 'don't do this'.

00:32:40.179 --> 00:32:43.159
That I will not say because then half of you
may run away.

00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:53.879
But it will happen in such a manner that you
yourself won't do that.

00:32:53.879 --> 00:32:55.249
I don't have to tell you at all.

00:32:55.249 --> 00:33:03.249
Because firstly if you try to do it you will
lose your vibrations you feel unhappy.

00:33:03.249 --> 00:33:13.210
You'll lose your joy and peace and maybe your
body may react and that it may vomit out the

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:24.739
thing or it may make you very painful so that
you just don't do it.

00:33:24.739 --> 00:33:27.129
You become righteousness, you become virtuous
and you enjoy your virtues.

00:33:27.129 --> 00:33:31.499
You don't force your virtues on others you
just say that one day he should get Realization.

00:33:31.499 --> 00:33:43.970
The concern is as if a part of your body is
sick and you want to soothe it and put it

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:44.970
right.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:45.970
No obligation, nothing.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:54.220
If somebody is drowning himself actually part
of you is getting drowned that's why you jump

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.529
into it.

00:33:55.529 --> 00:34:04.059
But here actually you feel the another person
and if you know how to cure that then there's

00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:07.409
no obligation at all because there is a part
and parcel of your being.

00:34:07.409 --> 00:34:08.409
Supposing this finger is paining and if I
rub it.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.050
Am I obliging myself?

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:17.419
But it is so spontaneous it is so automatic
that the idea also doesn't come into your

00:34:17.419 --> 00:34:19.560
head that you have obliged him.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.530
It's so simple.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:26.260
This is the power of God's love.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.610
We have never used that before because we
were not capable of doing that.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:35.110
All these wars and all these problems of the
world are because we are using the power of

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.110
hatred.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:44.770
We talk of peace but how will you make peace
on this earth when the people are so disturbed?

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:54.590
The source of peace is the Spirit and if the
whole world or a part of it and a very wee

00:34:54.590 --> 00:35:03.360
part of it accepts that they should have their
Spirit manifesting and they establish themselves

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.360
you'll see all these problems will vanish
into thin air.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.380
As it is in your private life they vanish
out.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.310
Everything becomes smooth joyous happy.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:29.280
The relationships become very pure and you
really enjoy human beings for the first time.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.170
Otherwise it is just we'll say "Oh we are
brothers, brothers, brothers.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.080
We are sisters, we are this that."

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:41.720
When it comes to selfishness everything drops
out because it's just a mental projection.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:46.170
Even countries will say we are all friends,
we are going to help, but when it comes to

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.780
something important they drop out.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.350
But this is no mental projection, is reality.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:36:02.210
Become that and that should happen to many,
many people by that a kind of a catalysism

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:08.000
will take place and the whole world has to
be changed as promised.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.240
Those days are ahead, is working out very
well, I have worked in this England for ten

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240
years.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:27.920
In India hardly two years, but thousands and
thousands in the villages are now Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.471
They have given up all their bad habits.

00:36:29.471 --> 00:36:32.920
They have become masters of themselves.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:38.580
Even I would say in England we have quite
a lot of Sahaja Yogis, but still is a very

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:45.650
important place is England because it plays
a very important role in spirituality because

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:54.460
it is the heart of the universe and the heart
has to pump out the truth.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.320
It's pumping out all kind of nonsense on the
television.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:04.820
Today on the television they gave Me hardly
thirty seconds first and then three minutes.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:15.200
What do I do in three minutes, but for a joker
or a clown or for absolutely useless person

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.550
there will be hours together.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:28.790
This is the problem that we have to face,
but I am sure when the chaos will be seen

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:38.330
clearly people will ask for the answer and
when they seek that they will receive what

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.540
they are seeking.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.560
That is a promise and the promise has to be
fulfilled.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.240
All that is promised in the scriptures has
to be fulfilled.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.060
May God bless you all.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:00.840
Now if you have any problems please ask me.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.130
Today I had a very, very hectic day.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:13.340
The whole day I have been moving from places
to places and somehow you have been so kind

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:19.380
to come here and I am sure we'll get the experience
tonight.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:26.170
But in any case if you have any questions
please ask.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:30.310
Is important.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:43.070
From the seekers: May I ask a question Mataji?

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:47.620
Mother: Yes please.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:54.200
From the seekers: Is it possible to awaken
Kundalini without a spring guidance like You

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.400
because You are not available to us so only
by reading books?

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400
Mother: Yes it is possible.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400
Only

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400
Sahaja Yogi: 'Only by reading books' she said

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.400
Mother: By reading books.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400
No, no, no not at all.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.400
Kabir Das has said "Padhi, padhi pandita murakha
bhayei".

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.700
That by reading too much even the learned
have become stupid.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:11.480
Seeker: So how could we have Divine guidance
like You?

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.470
Mother: What you have to do first of all is
to know that it's a living process and for

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:21.330
any living process you don't need mental understanding.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:28.870
Just I have talked to you because after all
you are very intelligent people.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:33.680
But supposing we want to sprout a seed what
do we do?

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.980
We put it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.540
Do we give it a lecture before hand?

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.870
All right do we do anything?

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:53.530
It is built-in in the seed as well as in the
Mother Earth the capacity to do it.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:40:00.821
So of course you have to have somebody who
has the capacity.

00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:01.821
Satguru is the real Guru.

00:40:01.821 --> 00:40:04.250
But these days they are all in the market;
all making money.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:10.440
First thing is no money can be paid for sprouting
of the seed; first principle.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:21.610
Ninety nine point nine percent [99.9%] will
drop out on that point and is said that 'Sahib

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:22.610
Milaye'.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:28.480
The one who makes you meet the Divine is the
Guru.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.850
The one who talks and gives lecture is not
the Guru.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:38.410
But these days there are some very great Gurus
but they are hiding themselves in the Himalayas

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:43.760
and I sent one of them with great request
to America that please go and do some work

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.790
in America I won't be able to go.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.380
He stayed in New York for three days and ran
back into Himalayas.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:54.860
He said, "The people are at a very lower level
you see, they just talk of dollar."

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.320
He ran away.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:05.450
So they don't want to deal just now perhaps
maybe after sometime if they see that the

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.770
area is all right, they may come down.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:11.780
But there are many great saints all over the
world.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.370
But sort of they have receded themselves.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:24.980
First you all become saints and they will
all come to join.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:30.900
Seeker: To become saint is very difficult.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.570
Mother: Who told you that?

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.570
Seeker: Afreed

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:35.570
Mother: It is the easiest thing.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.700
Living process is the easiest.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:40.610
But we are so difficult we don't want to eat
like this we want to go round and eat, then

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.270
say...It is the simplest thing.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:48.730
'Sahaja Samadhi Lago', Sahaja you get it.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:54.960
Is said by everyone who said it is difficult?

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.440
Who has said it tell me?

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.600
No one.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.250
'Ek hi akshar premaka pade so pandita ho'.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.570
Who has said it?

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.900
Did Christ say so?

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.220
Did Buddha say so?

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.220
Nobody said.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:19.630
But they could not do it because people were
difficult.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:27.510
So they said all right go ahead, carry on.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:33.590
Krishna at the very outset of Gita he said
that you find yourself.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:37.500
You become a 'sthita pragya'.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.000
You become a realized soul, at the very outset.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.830
But Arjuna says, "But how You are telling
me to go on war and here You are telling me

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.650
to become 'saakshi', the witness?"

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:51.500
Krishna was a Father.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:57.550
He said, 'This gentleman won't understand
in a straight way.'

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:02.980
Because Krishna is a special incarnation of
diplomacy, he understand how human beings

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.190
are, like a Father you see.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.200
He won't tell straight forward.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.880
He will say 'all right you want to do it go
ahead.'

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.190
You want to jump in the sea go ahead.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:19.550
So He said, "All right," it's very interesting
we don't understand Gita also without Realization.

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:26.890
Like a father who comes out of his house and
sees his son trying to drive the cart.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:32.750
So he says, "All right you want to drive the
cart please put the horse before the cart."

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:38.740
But the son says, "No I can put the horse
behind and drive the cart."

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.500
He said, "All right do it no harm.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.210
Only put your attention there."

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:49.190
So he says that, "All right you do all your
work, but put it at the Lotus Feet of the

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:50.190
God."

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:53.900
You cannot do it, is an absurd condition.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.750
You cannot do it; absurd condition.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.460
But when you get your Realization you don't
say "I do it".

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.540
You say, "It's going", "it's coming", "it's
working", "it's happening".

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.330
You become a third person; 'akarm'.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:10.820
The second he said about 'bhakti' is the devotion.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:20.190
He said 'pushpam; all the flowers and fruits
and all these you give Me, I take them' but

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.380
where did He play?

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:29.900
On the word 'ananya' means you have to do
the devotion when you are not the other 'ananya'.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.170
Now when are you like that?

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:42.090
When you are one within and also is logical
that unless and until you are connected within

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:46.220
what sort of a bhakti [devotion] you are doing
here?

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.460
You must be connected.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:52.040
Only 'bhakti' you can do is to say that "Connect
me".

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.380
But otherwise if you are not connected, if
the telephone is not connected what are you

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.380
telephoning?

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.760
Is as simple as that, is very logical.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:13.480
So the whole 'Karma Yoga' and 'Bhakti Yoga'
is nothing but that you get your Self-Realization

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.380
first.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:33.500
Now this is the problem with human beings
that they want to live on words, but how long?

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.020
Nothing is difficult.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.550
So far I have not seen it is a difficult thing
to do.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:38.550
It has worked out.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.550
Any other question please?

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:49.710
[From the audience someone asks a question
related to astrology, the question is not

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.160
audible]

00:45:53.160 --> 00:46:10.420
Mother: Is of no consequence.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:18.010
Seeker: Is of no consequence?

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.660
Mother: No consequence
This is very subtle, above everything else,

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.660
makes no difference.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:31.640
But later on I find because we are problematic
people and the Kundalini comes down to help

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.510
you in different places.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:43.080
And I find that sometimes the people how they
are made at their birth by astrology behave

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.370
in different manners.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:54.960
But still the sign and all these things that
are so gross do not bind you.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:03.220
You just throw them away and get out of it.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:09.260
So it's nothing important.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.876
You go beyond all stars, beyond all science
and things.

00:47:12.876 --> 00:47:31.870
It is of help in a way; for example they cast
My horoscope in India and they discovered

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:37.870
something about Me and which is something
very fantastic I should say.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.570
It has something.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:43.670
For example: discovering this, you may think
'what is it discovering this?'

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.560
'What was the use of the Kundalini has nothing
to do it?'

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:53.530
But today only on the radio I could give Realization
to many people.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:57.090
On the television you can give Realization
to people.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.550
So this is also useful.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:03.700
Everything is achieved for Self-Realization.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:10.830
Science has achieved everything for Self-Realization.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:20.360
It is at the service of God and whatever is
not is all destructive.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:31.100
Even I would say atom bomb is important otherwise
people would never have thought of God.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:53.250
Seeker: Yes; On to religion, Catholics why
is it that they make such a do of the Pope?

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.250
He's only flesh and blood.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:55.250
Mother: What do they do?

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:56.340
Sahaja Yogi: Why do Christians and Catholicism
particularly make such a thing of the Pope?

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.700
He's only flesh and blood.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:04.930
Mother: You better go and ask them.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:13.150
About this Pope John, I went with My Husband
to Cranko and being a VIP or something, they

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.880
asked Me, "What would You like to see?"

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.680
I said, "I would like to see some good Church."

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:25.730
So they took Me to Cranko where this fellow
was the Cardinal and they held some sort of

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:26.730
a mass.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:32.300
I was sitting there and then I shook hands
with him and had tea with him and I rose his

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:33.300
Kundalini.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:39.640
It came and went back in the same shot.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:45.720
But sometimes when he is talking sense, the
Kundalini is up there; you see it come up

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.720
and goes down.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:52.590
Still he's not established himself; the same
fellow who became the Pope.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:50:04.490
But why they make out of it is this because
Mr. Paul who is in the Bible.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:09.470
I don't know why he's there; has done all
this.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:14.730
Now first you must ask Me a question 'Why
Mother Mr. Paul is there in the Bible?'

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.550
Can you explain to Me that?

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:22.150
He never saw Christ; he had nothing to do
with Christ.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:26.930
Now I am asking you a simple question you
see, from God's side.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:33.490
Somebody must ask from God's side also sometimes
some questions.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:40.390
All right now this gentleman was just torturing
Christians, he becomes epileptic, he sees

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:42.240
some cross as he says.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.410
Whatever it is, sees something so what?

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:50.060
And then he is in the Bible.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.890
How come?

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:55.830
Now he is not a free soul.

00:50:55.830 --> 00:51:03.680
If you accept Paul, this I had said long time
back, you will have to give up Christ and

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.500
that's what is happening today.

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:16.460
All right and even Protestants because I took
My birth in Protestants, among Protestants.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.910
I know them.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:24.490
I know about all of them - Christians and
Hindus and Muslims and every one, are all

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:25.490
funny fanatics.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.460
But the Protestants are very sophisticated
fanatics.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:34.550
It's impossible to talk to them, specially
in India.

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:35.900
Oh baba!

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:42.560
They are so sophisticated, they've done all
the science of the Bible.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.710
They've made science out of Bible.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:50.150
Bible is so great how can you put it in the
science?

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:55.960
Science is a wee part of it.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.430
You agree there with Me?

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:04.270
So now first let us accept we are first and
foremost human beings and we have to become

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:07.440
super human beings as realized souls.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.590
Whether you are Christian, Catholics, Hindus,
Muslims anything.

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:18.460
It should be such, how can it be different?

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:22.610
Does God know that you went to a Anglican
Church or to another Church?

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.230
Does he, will he know?

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:27.820
Accha tell Me, do you think he will know all
these things?

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:28.820
Do you think?

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.170
Somebody must be keeping a record.

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:31.350
Do you think so?

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:36.870
I mean is it not ridiculous the way we fight
about these things.

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:43.390
Can He keep record of all these things?

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:47.720
And it's not only about Christians, it's same
in Hindus.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:56.540
Hindus are very fanatic, Sikhs are fanatics,
Muslims are fanatics; all blind people are

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.540
there.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.540
But they are good people you know?

00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.630
They believe in it.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:05.140
They are innocent; they believe that what
they believe into is the truth.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:12.760
They have to just know that the truth is universal
and is for everyone.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.030
You cannot claim anyone as your own.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.620
Actually by that you've killed the truth.

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:23.390
Like a tree has many flowers, living flowers
you pluck some of them saying this; this is

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:31.880
mine, this is mine and the flower dies and
that ugly flower becomes your fanatic religion.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.740
It's not a living flower.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:41.300
In Sahaja Yoga we know that all Prophets were
right.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.540
What They said were right; we believe in Them.

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:52.670
We use Them on these different centers and
all the incarnations we use, but as far as

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:59.340
the outside religions are concerned we think
they need some cleansing and light.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:07.650
Then everything will be all right.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:08.650
You are Catholic?

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.820
I mean you educated, I am sorry now you are
no.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:19.890
But whether the education was in Catholic
Church?

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:23.410
If you want to hear about Christians, go and
ask Muslims.

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:26.660
If you want to hear about Muslims, go and
ask Hindus.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.490
If you want to hear about Hindus, go and ask
Buddhist.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.310
You'll get the full picture about them.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:38.710
You see we can see what others are we don't
see what we are.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:39.860
True.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:45.590
Sahaja Yogi: Any other question?

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:53.950
Mother's going to give you the experience
tonight, so why don't we do it now?

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.480
Just lift your shoes off so that your feet...

00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:05.090
Mother: You better take out your shoes.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:15.290
That's all I make humble request, that's all.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:29.370
I hope it's not difficult to take them out.

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:35.680
I'll stand up I think.

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.840
Paul, can you help Me please?

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:48.000
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to stand....

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:59.310
Mother: There are lots of saints behind sitting
there and you all have to become saints.

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:07.801
For that just you have to put your hands on
your lap as they do for Namaz like that because

00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:15.660
these fingers as you will see there are indicative
of your sympathetic nervous systems, left

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.600
and right and they form centers.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:25.740
So just put your hands like this.

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:34.460
Now this hand represents the power of desire
as you will see on the left hand side and

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:38.010
this hand represents the power of action.

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:54.860
Now what we have to do is to release our own
centers by giving help to them and the Kundalini

00:56:54.860 --> 00:57:01.640
will then rise immediately because if the
centers are augmented or constricted then

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.240
Kundalini has to fight it.

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:12.560
To make things easier for Her, we'll have
to put our hand, right hand on different centers,

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.880
which I'll tell you, which is very simple.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.920
You don't have to do much about it.

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:27.480
So now the right hand that is the power of
action we'll be using for touching different

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:35.350
parts like the heart, the stomach, the lower
part of the stomach, then here at the base

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:40.560
of the neck like this and then here on the
forehead.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:46.930
Ultimately on top of our head where the bone
was soft, the fontanel bone area.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.010
That's all.

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:52.910
It's very simple one by one I will tell you.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:59.210
Another thing very important is that you should
not open your eyes till I tell you because

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:01.740
the happening has to take place within.

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.820
Your attention should be inside and not outside.

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.300
It will be sucked in.

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:10.700
You don't have to do, don't fight with it,
don't fight with your thoughts, don't fight

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.700
with anything.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.630
Just let it loose it will work out.

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:21.930
You have to sit comfortably in a straight
manner without being lousy or without being

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:22.930
over alert.

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:27.860
Just sit in a very comfortable manner with
your left hand towards Me and the right hand

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.860
on the heart.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:35.180
You may take out your spectacles or anything
because you have to keep your eyes shut all

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.180
the time.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.180
It helps also the eye sight.

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.590
Now put the left hand on your heart.

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:40.150
Sahaja Yogi: Right hand

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:54.770
Mother: I am sorry put your right hand on
the heart and left hand towards Me.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:59:01.800
At the very outset I have to tell you one
thing that you should not feel guilty about

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:08.660
anything because that's one of the biggest
hurdles in the West.

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:13.720
So before saying anything you have to tell
yourself that 'I am not guilty, I am not guilty,

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.720
I am not guilty'.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.720
Close your eyes and say that.

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:31.520
You are not to put your neck very much backwards
or forward or in any abnormal way, but sit

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.840
comfortably.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:42.360
Now, on the heart you have to put your right
hand and all the time keep the left hand towards

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.740
Me.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:52.900
At this stage you have to ask Me a question
because I said you are a computer and this

00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900
is a very absolute question.

00:59:53.900 --> 01:00:01.420
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji whatever
suits you.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:05.680
'Mother, am I the Spirit?'

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:26.660
Ask this question, three times.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:33.010
Please don't open your eyes, keep the left
hand towards Myself and put your right hand

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:39.280
on your stomach in the upper-part; in the
upper-part of the abdomen on the left hand

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280
side.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.490
We have to just look after the left hand side
of our centers.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:54.360
So put the right hand on the left hand side
of the upper part of your stomach.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:03.320
Here lies the center of mastery; the Guru,
the Prophets.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:14.940
So here you have to say, because you have
already asked a question that 'Mother, am

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.870
I the Spirit?'

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:20.480
You have to ask now another question relevantly
with it.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.790
'Mother, am I my own Guru?'

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:34.450
Because if you are the master, if you are
the Spirit, automatically you become the master.

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:38.150
Unless and until you are the Spirit you do
not become the master.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:42.910
So the second question should be 'Mother am
I my own master?

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:45.390
Am I my own Guru?

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:54.020
Mother, am I the Prophet?'

01:01:54.020 --> 01:02:04.880
Three times please.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:25.980
Now, now we start with the real asking by
putting our right hand in the lower part of

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:29.250
our abdomen in the left hand side.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:41.180
The right hand on the lower part of our abdomen,
stomach, on the left hand side and press it

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.400
a little bit.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:55.840
Here now is the beginning of asking for the
true knowledge, for the true technique, for

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.950
the pure knowledge.

01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:04.480
So please ask Me six times because this center
is very important and has six petals, six

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.000
sub plexuses it controls.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:16.420
Please ask six times because I cannot force
you to do it unless and until you ask for

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.120
it because you are free.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:26.710
To respect your freedom I have tell you that
you have to ask 'Mother may I have the true

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:31.950
knowledge, the pure knowledge of the Spirit?'

01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:36.000
six times.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:52.550
Now you must be confident about it, you should
not be diffident, you should ask with full

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:55.450
confidence.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:04:04.180
Now, six times.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:13.670
Please don't feel guilty and be confident.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:24.580
Now we have to raise it so we go back to the
same position on the left side of our stomach

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.400
in the upper part.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:34.650
Please put your right hand on the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:41.490
Now here you have to assert with full confidence.

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:47.970
Ten times you have to say because there are
ten valences we have, we have Ten Commandments

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:53.610
and ten times the Primordial Master incarnated
on this Earth.

01:04:53.610 --> 01:05:05.500
So we have to say ten times in full confidence
'Mother I am my own master.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.430
Mother I am my own Guru.

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:23.210
Mother I am the Prophet'.

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:42.280
Now please say it ten times.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:48.830
Don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty.

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:58.460
[Mother blows Cool Breeze twice.]

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:12.230
Now ten times; raise your right hand after
saying ten times, to your heart.

01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:23.900
Again here there are twelve sub plexuses,
so you have to assert with full confidence

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:33.840
by saying 'Mother I am the Spirit', which
is the truth.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:59.990
Without feeling guilty you must say that because
God is the ocean of love, he is the ocean

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:02.300
of compassion.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:09.130
He is the ocean of forgiveness and what kind
of guilt you can have?

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:14.580
What kind of sin you can commit that He cannot
forgive?

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:26.060
So don't try to count your sins and count
your mistakes and count your guilt just say,

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:30.490
'Mother I am the Spirit'.

01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:59.740
Now saying this about twelve times you raise
your right hand at the base of the neck and

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.510
press it hard on the shoulder.

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:09.160
This center is always caught up.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:18.929
So again I have to say that for sixteen times
you have to say, 'Mother I am not guilty'

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:25.040
and if you have the habit of feeling guilty
too much better say it hundred and eight times

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.009
to punish your self.

01:08:27.009 --> 01:08:32.150
I am assuring you that you are not guilty
but if you want to say that again and again

01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:35.380
all right go ahead with it for hundred and
eight times.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.780
Don't feel guilty otherwise you'll miss the
point.

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:47.080
[ Shri Mataji guides someone in the audience]
From the front hold it from the front not

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:57.339
from the back, 'saamne se hath lijiye, aise
pichese nahin, saamne se haath lijiye', tell

01:08:57.339 --> 01:08:58.339
him.

01:08:58.339 --> 01:09:08.050
That gentleman also, that one.

01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:10.529
Haan!

01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:29.390
Better from the front, much better.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:33.799
Sixteen times; believe in yourself.

01:09:33.799 --> 01:09:36.320
Have faith in yourself, forgive yourself.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.529
First of all you forgive yourself.

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:58.200
Or at the most you can say that 'O Lord forgive
me', but don't feel guilty while saying that.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:09.067
[Mother to Sahaja Yogi: You shouldn't disturb,
I know what to do.

01:10:09.067 --> 01:10:10.067
I don't want to listen to you.]

01:10:10.067 --> 01:10:21.560
Now... you have to raise your hand up to your
forehead 

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:31.980
and here you have to say in a very simple
words, 'Mother I forgive everything, I forgive

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:37.400
everyone' with full heart in it.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.430
Now some people told Me it's very difficult
and this and that but actually when you don't

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:44.410
forgive, what do you do?

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:48.080
Or when you forgive what do you do?

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.310
Nothing, it's all mythical.

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:59.380
On the contrary you are torturing yourself
by not forgiving.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:23.430
So please say from your heart, 'Mother I forgive
everyone'; on your forehead.

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:43.590
Now, now raise your hand on top of your head,
put it on the fontanel bone area, your palm

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:49.490
and press it and move it clockwise, your scalp.

01:11:49.490 --> 01:12:00.739
At this point you have to say, 'Mother please
give me my Realization' because I cannot cross

01:12:00.739 --> 01:12:02.770
your freedom again.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:06.100
This you have to say seven times.

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:12.530
But before doing that please say that, 'If
I have done anything wrong, O Lord please

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:14.310
forgive me'.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:24.420
Without feeling guilty again; three times.

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:36.130
Now seven times you say, 'Mother please give
me my Self-Realization' because I cannot cross.

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:56.590
[Mother blows the Cool Breeze twice...]

01:12:56.590 --> 01:13:10.230
[What heat baap re...]

01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:12.470
Now take down that hand.

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:17.370
[Mother blows Cool Breeze twice.]

01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:28.540
Now put the left hand on top of your head
about four inches above and see for yourself

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.940
if there's a Cool Breeze coming in.

01:13:29.940 --> 01:14:13.750
[Mother blows Cool Breeze seven times]

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:20.900
Now change your hands and see for yourself
if there's a Cool Breeze coming in.

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:36.060
Right side is clear, good.

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:47.440
Now left side.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:15:03.950
Again change your hands and see if there is
a Cool Breeze coming.

01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:06.480
Ah!

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.010
better.

01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:31.710
Mother to Sahaja Yogi: You have to ask the
master question, Holy Ghost; later not just

01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:32.710
now.

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:37.830
Mother: Now those who are not feeling the
Cool Breeze raise your hands please.

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:41.730
Please raise them high so that they could
see.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:45.140
Now the Sahaja Yogis will come and attend
to you.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.420
Now don't get upset with them.

01:15:46.420 --> 01:16:07.820
If you are not feeling the Cool Breeze raise
your hands and if you are feeling it you got

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:08.820
it.

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.820
She's got it, Vishuddhi, it is, she feels
guilty.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.480
You felt it?

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:18.170
Have you felt it?

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:19.920
Not yet?

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:27.680
All right; Aapko nahin hua?

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.790
Aarahe hai.

01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:33.680
Some have felt, some have not felt doesn't
matter.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.000
Sahaja Yogi: Just describe again what they
should feel

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:46.670
Mother: You should feel a Cool Breeze coming
out of your head like a cooler.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:49.780
There might be hot coming in doesn't matter.

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.950
You got it?

01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:58.930
Sahaja Yogi: ...He's got a Cool Breeze coming
from his hand into his head.

01:16:58.930 --> 01:16:59.930
Mother: Correct!

01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:06.140
Now just see if it is coming from your head
or not.

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.350
Just check.

01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:15.770
Tell him to say that 'Mother come in my head'.

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.860
This lady, Derrick you go, just come and see.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.860
It's better now, see.

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.980
You may ask 'Is this the Cool Breeze of the
Holy Ghost?'

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:24.000
What about this lady?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.900
Ya, no somebody should attend to her and this
one.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.850
Is there some another way someone should come
and attend to this lady?

01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:30.850
'Aaapka nahin hua?

01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:31.850
Ho gaye?

01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:32.850
Aaraha hai?

01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:33.850
Ho gaye paar?

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:34.850
Paar utara gaye sant jana re.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:35.850
Haan'

01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:36.850
From the audience: There's slight tingling
on this palm.

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:37.850
Mother: In the left hand?

01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:43.710
Ask him to ask the question of Holy Ghost.

01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:46.310
On the left hand if they have tingling you
can very easily do that.

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.760
Sahaja Yogi: Anyone who's getting the tingling
or not getting the vibrations on the left

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.760
hand...

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.520
Mother: No, no let them tell them privately;
don't make it open

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.520
Sahaja Yogi:...just put your left hand to
Mother.

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.520
Mother: Ask the question

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.750
Sahaja Yogi: Give me the Cool Breeze of the
Holy Ghost.

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:58.090
Mother: No, 'Are You the, Mother are You the
Holy Ghost?'

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:07.250
I am asking to ask 'Mother are You the Holy
Ghost?'

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:14.630
Aa raha hai (it's coming?) left hand towards
Me.

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:18.880
Left hand towards Me.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:31.150
From the audience: 'Mother, are You the Holy
Ghost?

01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:32.320
Are You the Holy Spirit?

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320
Mother: All right the tingling has gone, the
answer has come, now recognize.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320
May God bless you.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320
Now this gentleman, what about the one who
was worried about the Pope?

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320
Did he feel the Cool Breeze?

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320
This lady she's got it.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320
What about you?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320
Lady from the seekers: ...tingle

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320
Mother: tingle on both the hands?

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320
Lady: ..On both the hands

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.320
Mother: She has both the hands give her a
bandhan.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320
Haan ab bas shanti dharo, chit mein hi shanti.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.320
This gentleman - Maria?

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.320
You have not forgiven; keep your eyes open
and watch Me and say 'Mother I forgive'.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.320
Seeker: Mother I forgive everyone.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320
Mother I forgive everyone.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320
Sahaja Yogi: Getting less tingle?

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.320
Just say it again ..., while looking at Mother.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.320
Mother: Ho gaya jagaran?

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.320
Have got it.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320
You got it sir?

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320
Inke bhi ho gaya (he also got it).

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320
Aap unke sar pe dekhiye aura (you see on top
of his head, aura).

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320
Haan has he got it?

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320
Tingling left?

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320
Ask him to ask the question of the Holy Ghost,
you ask.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320
Just enjoy don't think about it; just enjoy
yourself, you got it.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320
Now you have to establish yourself that's
the most important part and in Leicester we

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.320
have a very powerful Sahaja Yogi, .. has spoken
to you.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320
Sahaja Yogi: Just say 'Shri Mataji are You
the Holy Ghost?

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.320
Shri Mataji are You the Holy Ghost?'

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.320
Mother: Holy Ghost mane [means] Adi Shakti.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.320
Haan

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.320
Sahaja Yogi: You are feeling it on your left
hand?

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.320
Mother: That's the answer.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.320
What about this lady?

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.320
She got it?

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320
She's got it.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320
Sahaja Yogi: ...she is Sahaja Yogi

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320
What about her?

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.320
Haan what about this one, this gentleman with
spectacles?

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.320
Is she all right...?

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.320
Good.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320
Dekhiye sab paar hogaye.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320
Tell him not to feel guilty.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.320
This gentleman here

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.320
Sahaja Yogi: Yellow shirt

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320
Mother: Yellow shirt, please don't feel guilty.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.320
What about the gentleman behind.....he's all
right, he's got it, he's got it.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320
John you better get their names, who belong
to Leicester.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320
Maria, Maria come.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.320
Gavin I saw I think?

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.320
Sahaja Yogini: Yes he's here.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.320
Mother: He's here; all right, all right.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320
What do you say comes up and down?

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320
Tie it up, tie it up.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
Gavin...

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.320
Sahaja Yogi: ..he's the Indian gentleman

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.320
Mother: Haan he's what?

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320
Ask him to pull his ears.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.320
Sahaja Yogi: He's feeling it now, he pulled
his ears.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.320
Please work in silence.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.320
Please work in silence.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.320
Please work in silence.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320
Sahaja yogi: It's very important that you
should follow-up this experience.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.320
There is a center in Leicester and at that
center they can teach you very simple techniques

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.320
some of which you've seen being done now to
purify and remove these blockages in the charkas.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.320
They'll teach you how to raise your Kundalini
how to establish it, how to develop your vibrations

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.320
and then ultimately how to cure yourself,
how to cure others and how to give others

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.320
self-realization.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.320
It's so simple that you have to work it out
together.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320
John is going to be here ultimately and meanwhile
they are going to have regular meetings so

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320
that you can follow it up.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.320
John will tell you little more.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.320
[Mother: Agya; she has very bad Agya.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320
Ask her to forgive everyone.]

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320
John: We'll be holding meetings every Thursday
evening at his place; probably in the other

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320
room but in this building, 7.30 Thursday evenings.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320
If you come along we can help you to maintain
this experience and also to deepen it because

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320
what's happened this evening is like a seed
as I say it's not become a old tree yet.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.320
It's still a seed so by nurturing it, protecting
it, watering it so on.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.320
It will enable it to grow and that's what
you can do at these meetings.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.320
Very soon you can learn as much as the Sahaja
Yogis here have learnt, maybe even more hopefully

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320
by Shri Mataji's blessings.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.320
There's an address list that we are taking
if you'd like to leave us your name and address

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.320
we can then get in touch and you know in any
other big meetings we can send you a post

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320
card reminding you where our regular meetings
are and we'll also put in the address of the

01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320
center, the Sahaja Yoga center and then if
you have any problems any [stage?] or anything

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320
like that you can contact us and we can tell
you what to do and so on.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.320
Thank you very much

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.320
[Mother: So I am very thankful for all this...What
was the name of the gentleman on the TV?

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.320
Sahaja yogi: The interviewer?

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.320
Mother: No the other person.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.320
He's the main person...

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.320
Sahaja yogi: He's the editor, the film editor.]

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.320
Mother: Now I have to tell you one thing,
you should not discuss about your realization

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.320
too much.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.320
Please Sahaja Yogis also should know.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.320
You see you are all Sahaja Yogis and you have
achieved it, but they are still just, they

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.320
have just gone into it.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320
So try to understand, they are not like you
that whatever is the situation you keep there.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.320
They, you have attained it, they have to attain
still.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320
So keep quiet and another thing is please
don't think about it don't talk about it too

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320
much.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.320
Work it out.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.320
Its not that by talking is will work out on
the contrary the more you'll think about it

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.320
the worse it will be.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.320
It's like a small little plant, a little shoot.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.320
We have to be now careful with it, respect
it and gradually when you'll be coming to

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.320
those meetings you'll develop it.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320
While the Sahaja Yogis who are here, all are
experts and whatever may happen even there's

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:22.321
earthquake...
