00:05:24.842 --> 00:05:29.962
Today is a great day for all of us,

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:32.842
because it is the sixteenth Sahasrara Day.

00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:47.562
That in sixteen beats

00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:53.282
or sixteen movements

00:05:53.522 --> 00:05:58.242
you reach a higher position in the coil.

00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:18.362
That it is complete,

00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:26.922
that Shri Krishna is called as a complete incarnation

00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:35.322
because He has sixteen petals.

00:06:50.962 --> 00:06:54.642
This completeness is called as "purna."

00:06:59.722 --> 00:07:05.002
So, now we move into another dimension.

00:07:10.202 --> 00:07:20.282
The first one was where you got your Self-realization.

00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:31.682
In the evolutionary process,

00:07:31.842 --> 00:07:38.842
if you see, the animals are not conscious

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:43.082
of many things which human beings are conscious of.

00:07:54.562 --> 00:08:01.242
Like the matter cannot be used by animals

00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:05.322
for their own purpose.

00:08:14.402 --> 00:08:17.962
Also they are not conscious of themselves at all.

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:24.762
If you show a mirror to animals

00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:29.362
they do not react to it as if they are in the mirror,

00:08:40.282 --> 00:08:42.442
except for, I think, chimpanzees.

00:08:46.682 --> 00:08:49.562
That means that we are rather close to them!

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:03.202
So, when we have become human beings,

00:09:03.402 --> 00:09:08.042
we became aware in our consciousness

00:09:08.242 --> 00:09:13.682
of many things which were unconscious to the animals.

00:09:27.722 --> 00:09:33.082
So, in their brain they did not understand

00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:38.882
that they could put matter into their own use.

00:09:49.362 --> 00:09:54.042
As human beings you were all unaware

00:09:54.242 --> 00:09:59.682
of the chakras that existed within you.

00:10:09.522 --> 00:10:13.242
So your consciousness still was working

00:10:13.442 --> 00:10:17.002
halfway through unconscious

00:10:17.202 --> 00:10:24.962
working of the chakras and the conscious working of the mind.

00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:46.642
You also never felt your autonomous nervous system

00:10:46.802 --> 00:10:52.402
or your inner organs, how they're working.

00:11:02.242 --> 00:11:05.162
You did not even feel how

00:11:05.362 --> 00:11:10.522
you are getting affected by other influences.

00:11:20.162 --> 00:11:25.882
As a result of that,

00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:31.362
with the freedom that human beings achieved

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:33.882
or were granted,

00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:38.082
they gathered all kinds of things

00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:41.762
into their brains, into their Sahasrara,

00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:45.922
without being aware of it.

00:12:05.242 --> 00:12:10.122
They used their Sahasrara, their brain

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:17.922
for all kinds of purposes which were fruitless.

00:12:27.242 --> 00:12:30.882
They were not aware, again,

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.722
of the warning that Shri Krishna had given

00:12:33.922 --> 00:12:40.562
that if you use human awareness except for your ascent,

00:12:40.762 --> 00:12:44.962
you will go downward.

00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:09.402
They were told. Not that they were not told.

00:13:09.642 --> 00:13:12.442
They knew about it.

00:13:19.202 --> 00:13:22.362
Whether it was East or West, everybody knew

00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:26.322
that you have to be born again.

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:40.842
And it so happened that in the West

00:13:41.002 --> 00:13:46.322
people thought that by using their brainpower

00:13:46.562 --> 00:13:51.082
they can now master the matter;

00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:02.682
that they can use matter for their own purpose.

00:14:04.962 --> 00:14:10.402
If they had done it after their Self-realization,

00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:15.442
it would have been a very different situation,

00:14:24.762 --> 00:14:27.082
because after Self-realization

00:14:27.282 --> 00:14:31.842
you all have become aware of vibrations,

00:14:32.042 --> 00:14:36.562
which is chaitanya, and also of your chakras.

00:14:46.882 --> 00:14:49.002
With this new awareness,

00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:53.802
you would have avoided all that was wrong.

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:05.522
But it is like a greedy person,

00:15:05.682 --> 00:15:10.682
who gets a wee bit of money and he spends it off.

00:15:26.122 --> 00:15:33.402
Now this problem has complicated your brains.

00:15:37.442 --> 00:15:44.642
You have certain concepts, which are very much away from reality.

00:15:52.602 --> 00:15:55.922
The way we have started using machines,

00:15:56.122 --> 00:16:00.042
we have become machines ourselves.

00:16:07.442 --> 00:16:12.322
So we have no feelings and we cannot relate

00:16:12.522 --> 00:16:16.762
to others in a natural way.

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:29.762
In human awareness you had achieved

00:16:29.962 --> 00:16:36.522
how to relate yourself to others and to the nature.

00:16:47.562 --> 00:16:50.322
But this ego-oriented approach

00:16:50.522 --> 00:16:58.442
took you away from natural, real life.

00:17:06.722 --> 00:17:10.442
And we became artificial.

00:17:13.842 --> 00:17:21.282
The whole thing comes from a concept of being artificial.

00:17:32.042 --> 00:17:39.162
Like they say that it's fashionable to be arrogant, to be snobbish.

00:17:46.722 --> 00:17:50.682
This is just the opposite of your ascent

00:17:50.842 --> 00:17:53.642
and evolutionary process

00:17:57.682 --> 00:18:04.282
because you have lost the power to relate to others,

00:18:04.442 --> 00:18:08.362
which you had gained as human beings.

00:18:18.242 --> 00:18:21.042
All the organizations which you have formed

00:18:21.242 --> 00:18:28.543
also on collective understanding are also artificial.

00:18:37.602 --> 00:18:42.642
Then a movement started that we have to be natural.

00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:56.388
That is another copying of the artificial.

00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:05.868
Natural does not mean a primitive personality.

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:11.948
Natural is to evolve.

00:19:15.508 --> 00:19:20.348
The whole purpose of creation is to evolve.

00:19:22.508 --> 00:19:26.508
So the another concept also that you accepted very easily

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.828
because you have got brains

00:19:28.988 --> 00:19:33.548
and you accept everything that comes your way.

00:19:43.188 --> 00:19:48.548
And you became so artificial that you needed all the time

00:19:48.748 --> 00:19:52.548
some sensations to feel yourself.

00:20:08.939 --> 00:20:11.299
Now in every walk of life [missing part, 20 seconds]

00:20:20.036 --> 00:20:22.796
But that also you made so artificial

00:20:22.996 --> 00:20:26.996
that you have now your sex in your brain.

00:20:36.556 --> 00:20:41.596
By that not only you have silenced Ganesha in the Mooladhara,

00:20:41.796 --> 00:20:45.756
but also Mahaganesha in your brain.

00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:59.596
In another aspect, say art.

00:21:01.996 --> 00:21:05.036
Now the concept is so stupid

00:21:05.236 --> 00:21:14.076
that it says that art should be according to what is laid down.

00:21:18.796 --> 00:21:20.156
Whatever is laid down about art,

00:21:20.356 --> 00:21:23.556
that art should be such, such, such.

00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:37.996
Like you will call somebody as baroque, condemn it,

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:43.436
then rococo, this, that. Condemn everyone.

00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:52.996
And ultimately you reach a conclusion

00:21:53.196 --> 00:21:57.316
that the most insipid thing is art.

00:22:05.876 --> 00:22:09.316
As if, like the sugarcane, when you have taken out all the juice,

00:22:09.476 --> 00:22:13.636
whatever remains will become art one day.

00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:29.196
So the brain, which does not nourish the heart

00:22:29.356 --> 00:22:35.756
is absolutely an artificial brain, just like a robot.

00:22:43.076 --> 00:22:47.316
So people have become just like robots.

00:22:51.196 --> 00:22:54.556
Now this can be handled by anyone

00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:58.156
who has a mastermind.

00:23:02.196 --> 00:23:04.916
Because you don't have your own heart

00:23:05.156 --> 00:23:09.036
and the brain is controlled by somebody

00:23:09.276 --> 00:23:13.956
who has a greater brain of concepts.

00:23:23.556 --> 00:23:29.156
All these concepts are destructive.

00:23:51.916 --> 00:23:57.316
Say Hitler got the concept that he is an Aryan

00:23:57.516 --> 00:24:01.676
and he is of the superior race.

00:24:08.276 --> 00:24:11.996
And to establish that, he did not mind

00:24:12.196 --> 00:24:14.356
destroying the whole world.

00:24:23.436 --> 00:24:29.516
Same is the case in the religion field.

00:24:36.436 --> 00:24:42.596
There also, every religion was put

00:24:42.796 --> 00:24:48.916
or poured into the cups of concepts.

00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:04.436
Now the worst concept that human beings have achieved,

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:08.836
is that money is everything.

00:25:18.076 --> 00:25:22.516
First they tried for political domination,

00:25:22.716 --> 00:25:28.436
thinking that political domination is everything.

00:25:33.876 --> 00:25:39.796
And now they feel that money is everything

00:25:40.036 --> 00:25:46.036
and all other sublime things are imaginary.

00:26:04.956 --> 00:26:11.676
So, when I started My life,

00:26:11.876 --> 00:26:17.516
I saw the complicated Sahasraras.

00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:33.396
And the more I tried to solve the complications

00:26:33.596 --> 00:26:38.836
within My own awareness,

00:26:39.036 --> 00:26:45.676
the more it became more difficult.

00:26:59.236 --> 00:27:06.796
Because if you see My age, in fifty years

00:27:06.996 --> 00:27:14.356
you can see how much complicated human beings have become.

00:27:26.596 --> 00:27:31.356
And after opening the Sahasrara, when I come to the West,

00:27:31.556 --> 00:27:33.716
within these sixteen years

00:27:33.916 --> 00:27:39.756
I found that they are now incorrigible.

00:28:02.956 --> 00:28:07.476
Now the stage for you is laid down

00:28:07.676 --> 00:28:10.876
to ascend higher.

00:28:18.156 --> 00:28:24.516
This is the background which I have described to you.

00:28:28.156 --> 00:28:33.036
And you can see how, when you have a program,

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:37.276
there will be 500 people for the program

00:28:37.476 --> 00:28:41.996
and within two weeks all will disappear.

00:28:52.596 --> 00:28:54.916
Because when the ascent takes place,

00:28:55.156 --> 00:28:59.396
the Kundalini pushes out the ego

00:28:59.596 --> 00:29:04.916
and brings the person close to reality.

00:29:12.676 --> 00:29:19.556
But again that ego, which is being built up so fast

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:23.276
in its speed, overpowers the speed

00:29:23.476 --> 00:29:27.676
of the Kundalini and covers the head.

00:29:47.156 --> 00:29:54.676
Then it suggests that, "how can you have godly life?"

00:29:57.476 --> 00:30:00.996
You will miss all the alcohol, all the madness,

00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:04.356
all the fun of life.

00:30:08.716 --> 00:30:14.796
That they feel, they will lose all the freedom to become mad.

00:30:20.236 --> 00:30:24.356
When you see from this position

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:29.476
the way people react, it is amazing.

00:30:41.556 --> 00:30:45.076
You have to do something extremely stupid

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:48.436
to sell it in the market.

00:30:55.916 --> 00:31:02.156
The other day I heard that somebody has become rich

00:31:02.356 --> 00:31:11.156
selling the empty tins as lamps.

00:31:20.836 --> 00:31:23.836
All kinds of stupid things,

00:31:23.996 --> 00:31:29.716
which are nowhere near natural beauty

00:31:29.916 --> 00:31:36.236
or natural joy, are accepted as sophisticated.

00:31:48.276 --> 00:31:53.196
The other side of it is that the asuri vidya,

00:31:53.356 --> 00:32:00.396
the black vidya has taken over.

00:32:18.076 --> 00:32:20.756
As Shri Krishna again had warned that,

00:32:20.956 --> 00:32:25.036
in the fifteenth chapter, that if asuri vidya takes over,

00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:28.276
then the suddha vidya cannot compete

00:32:28.476 --> 00:32:32.476
with the speed of asuri vidya.

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:53.156
Like in America there has been a big

00:32:53.356 --> 00:32:55.356
argument amongst Sahaja Yogis

00:32:55.579 --> 00:33:01.099
if My photograph should be in the drawing room or not.

00:33:13.772 --> 00:33:17.422
But if you ask them to paint their nails black,

00:33:17.452 --> 00:33:22.452
their faces black and black clothes like witches, they will do it.

00:33:33.572 --> 00:33:37.212
That even at the stage when we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:33:37.412 --> 00:33:43.292
we are shy of our godly life.

00:33:51.452 --> 00:33:54.972
When they became hippies or when they became punks

00:33:55.172 --> 00:33:58.612
or they became anything like that stupid,

00:33:58.852 --> 00:34:00.092
they gave all their life,

00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:03.612
all their time, all their money to it.

00:34:09.372 --> 00:34:12.212
They changed their dresses, they changed their lifestyles,

00:34:12.412 --> 00:34:18.132
they changed their family life, everything they changed, went all out.

00:34:23.852 --> 00:34:27.492
I mean, and even when Sahaja Yogis are convinced about

00:34:27.692 --> 00:34:33.772
the godliness of Sahaja Yoga, still they are shy.

00:34:44.352 --> 00:34:47.294
Now you know your Mother doesn't take any money from you,

00:34:47.383 --> 00:34:50.503
on the contrary She spends, you all have gained out of it.

00:34:50.528 --> 00:34:55.688
But when it comes to giving, everybody feels shy.

00:35:15.048 --> 00:35:23.128
From that background you are coming to the light of God's grace.

00:35:32.528 --> 00:35:34.488
But you don't want to dash at it,

00:35:34.648 --> 00:35:39.048
you want to take your time, gradually,

00:35:39.288 --> 00:35:45.728
so gradually that maybe you may lose your chance.

00:35:55.088 --> 00:35:58.928
So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis

00:35:59.128 --> 00:36:02.448
where you know all about your chakras,

00:36:02.648 --> 00:36:08.328
you know about vibrations, you know how you relate to others,

00:36:08.528 --> 00:36:16.288
still all this knowledge is for personal advantages.

00:36:27.568 --> 00:36:32.608
So, the shadow of the past still lingers on,

00:36:32.808 --> 00:36:38.368
even when you have this new awareness.

00:36:47.568 --> 00:36:49.888
Animals can swim automatically,

00:36:50.088 --> 00:36:51.848
they don't have to learn.

00:36:52.048 --> 00:36:55.928
But human beings have to learn to swim.

00:37:00.768 --> 00:37:04.848
So they had forgotten the techniques which were known to the animals

00:37:05.088 --> 00:37:09.968
and have taken to the techniques of human beings.

00:37:16.288 --> 00:37:18.968
But in Sahaja Yoga you have got

00:37:19.208 --> 00:37:23.008
your realization in one lifetime.

00:37:28.528 --> 00:37:32.368
And in this lifetime you have to grow.

00:37:35.848 --> 00:37:40.888
And in this lifetime you have to achieve the highest.

00:37:44.848 --> 00:37:48.208
So the time is so very short!

00:37:49.088 --> 00:37:52.608
And the background is so dark.

00:37:53.608 --> 00:37:56.888
You are surrounded by people who are pouring out

00:37:57.048 --> 00:38:01.648
morning till evening destructive concepts.

00:38:05.848 --> 00:38:10.448
Now, you are the people who have to shoot out

00:38:10.608 --> 00:38:14.008
much faster than all of them.

00:38:19.728 --> 00:38:24.008
But a kind of a lethargy, though you understand

00:38:24.248 --> 00:38:29.048
that your awareness is very different from them,

00:38:29.288 --> 00:38:33.888
a kind of a lethargy, which does not accept it

00:38:34.088 --> 00:38:38.008
the way it should accept Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:55.448 --> 00:38:59.808
Every one of you must think every day:

00:39:00.008 --> 00:39:04.808
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:39:13.452 --> 00:39:16.572
But you are all still very busy with your jobs,

00:39:16.772 --> 00:39:20.412
of making money, of have relations with people

00:39:20.612 --> 00:39:24.212
who do not matter at all in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:38.092 --> 00:39:42.612
We have to make an all out effort

00:39:42.812 --> 00:39:46.612
to rise to that point, that whatever we know,

00:39:46.852 --> 00:39:49.652
we believe in, we act on that

00:39:49.852 --> 00:39:53.212
and become one with it.

00:40:08.652 --> 00:40:12.012
You can do that with concepts, but not with reality,

00:40:12.212 --> 00:40:19.572
this is the problem, I mean ... I'll explain this point.

00:40:26.372 --> 00:40:32.212
Like supposing a fanatic believes

00:40:32.412 --> 00:40:36.732
that he can do such and such thing

00:40:36.932 --> 00:40:41.132
in his own religion, he will do it.

00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:04.013
When the concept is not reality,

00:41:04.213 --> 00:41:07.213
it has given no benefit to anyone,

00:41:07.453 --> 00:41:13.093
has shown no performance of any substance

00:41:13.293 --> 00:41:16.013
still people do it.

00:41:32.293 --> 00:41:37.373
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

00:41:38.373 --> 00:41:41.333
My father himself gave up all his property,

00:41:41.533 --> 00:41:47.693
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

00:41:47.893 --> 00:41:52.613
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

00:41:52.813 --> 00:41:56.853
for days together, for years together.

00:42:17.693 --> 00:42:21.493
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

00:42:21.693 --> 00:42:23.813
but for the subtler freedom

00:42:24.013 --> 00:42:28.773
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:33.762
So, the first thing is to realize, to be aware,

00:42:33.882 --> 00:42:39.402
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

00:42:51.731 --> 00:42:56.171
You are the ones who are very much higher

00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:59.931
than the rest of the humanity.

00:43:06.331 --> 00:43:13.571
That the salvation of the whole of the humanity depends on you.

00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:23.891
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:32.891
So, first of all you have to be conscious

00:43:33.091 --> 00:43:37.451
in your consciousness that you are so important,

00:43:37.651 --> 00:43:41.811
and that's why you were given realization.

00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:52.891
How can you be living with your conditionings

00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:56.331
and with your ego?

00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:05.091
The conditionings are like this:

00:44:05.251 --> 00:44:08.091
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:10.291
then you must bring that

00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:13.371
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:13.571 --> 00:44:15.451
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:18.571
you want to bring some out of that.

00:44:29.731 --> 00:44:33.611
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:39.171
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:57.691
All these things are like dirt over

00:44:57.891 --> 00:45:02.411
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

00:45:16.971 --> 00:45:19.291
Though now you are aware,

00:45:19.491 --> 00:45:24.371
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:28.131
you do not keep them clean.

00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:40.211
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:44.131
they have houses, they try to keep it clean.

00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:51.371
But you do not feel ashamed

00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:54.731
of them also when they are bad,

00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:57.531
because after some time

00:45:57.731 --> 00:46:01.131
you also lose the awareness of them.

00:46:12.131 --> 00:46:15.531
That means you have become subtler,

00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:22.291
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:42.211
There are so many things you know more

00:46:42.411 --> 00:46:47.451
than the people who are not realized,

00:46:47.651 --> 00:46:51.571
as absolute reality.

00:47:01.371 --> 00:47:06.691
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

00:47:10.611 --> 00:47:14.371
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

00:47:16.371 --> 00:47:20.371
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:23.771
we start giving bandhans.

00:47:29.731 --> 00:47:36.651
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:44.611
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:47.291
otherwise, in your central nervous system

00:47:47.451 --> 00:47:51.051
you are not yet so conscious.

00:48:04.891 --> 00:48:09.211
This is the reason, why you do not know

00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:17.091
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:37.371
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

00:48:37.571 --> 00:48:40.891
you cannot go further.

00:48:51.891 --> 00:48:55.811
For example, I know everything what I do.

00:48:59.931 --> 00:49:05.491
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:13.611
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:18.651
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

00:49:25.851 --> 00:49:28.611
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:32.131
I know about everyone of you.

00:49:39.131 --> 00:49:42.491
I may not know your worldly names,

00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:47.891
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

00:49:57.331 --> 00:50:03.411
I also can behave like a human being,

00:50:05.971 --> 00:50:10.291
absolutely like you, aging like you,

00:50:13.131 --> 00:50:16.331
even using spectacles,

00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:25.331
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:35.731
I have accepted this role consciously,

00:50:36.731 --> 00:50:39.131
not unconsciously.

00:50:39.371 --> 00:50:42.731
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

00:50:43.651 --> 00:50:50.171
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:53.211
you have to be alert about it.

00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:11.131
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

00:51:11.291 --> 00:51:13.251
the peace.

00:51:16.251 --> 00:51:19.651
But even now I find that peace

00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:24.331
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

00:51:34.771 --> 00:51:39.731
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

00:51:44.131 --> 00:51:46.771
It is a homogeneous thing.

00:51:47.371 --> 00:51:51.131
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

00:51:57.611 --> 00:52:00.851
We are unconscious about our fingers,

00:52:01.091 --> 00:52:03.146
but when we have to hold something,

00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:07.531
all of them come together and work it out.

00:52:17.731 --> 00:52:22.331
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

00:52:22.531 --> 00:52:27.571
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:31.571
That is what evolution is.

00:52:52.411 --> 00:53:03.434
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

00:53:15.611 --> 00:53:19.131
You must learn to face the reality,

00:53:19.331 --> 00:53:26.291
to accept the reality and act a real way.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.290
Now you may say, "Mother, this is a miracle."

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:45.770
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:52.450
Maybe for the human beings,

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:55.850
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.770
but not for Me

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.770
'cause I know what it is.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:15.170
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:22.850
one has to see how you are working it out.

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:45.610
The whole system of relating to

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:49.370
each other must change completely.

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:07.090
That is very important, at least for western people.

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:11.770
Because at least in India people know

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:14.730
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.850
you have to take to your ascent -

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.930
I mean the real Indians.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.210
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:43.730
and then disappear, some of them do.

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:55.930
But mostly they know that you have to be

00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:01.450
conscious of what you have got.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:20.810
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.450
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:43.450
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

00:56:43.658 --> 00:56:46.698
say of some great saint.

00:56:46.858 --> 00:56:50.458
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

00:56:50.658 --> 00:56:55.658
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

00:57:03.458 --> 00:57:05.938
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

00:57:06.138 --> 00:57:10.458
If your names are taken, why not the vibrations flow?

00:57:22.738 --> 00:57:26.938
And in this you have greater advantages

00:57:27.138 --> 00:57:30.058
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

00:57:30.298 --> 00:57:34.978
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

00:57:41.498 --> 00:57:47.538
But the disadvantage of that is this: that you take it for granted.

00:58:05.618 --> 00:58:09.578
Sometimes French is small, sometimes so big.

00:58:13.658 --> 00:58:19.898
Now, in expression, when we say something,

00:58:20.058 --> 00:58:22.938
when we express; are we natural,

00:58:23.138 --> 00:58:26.458
are we it doing from our heart?

00:58:35.818 --> 00:58:40.818
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:44.418
is what I want you to achieve.

00:58:56.138 --> 00:58:59.898
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:59:00.098 --> 00:59:03.698
others will just take it for granted.

00:59:09.698 --> 00:59:12.938
They do not want to help.

00:59:14.138 --> 00:59:17.618
They want everything to be ready-made.

00:59:19.338 --> 00:59:21.698
That shows that they are not conscious

00:59:21.898 --> 00:59:26.058
of their own powers of enjoyment.

00:59:34.218 --> 00:59:36.658
If they do it from their heart,

00:59:36.858 --> 00:59:44.298
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

00:59:44.538 --> 00:59:48.858
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

00:59:49.058 --> 00:59:52.018
or what they have achieved.

01:00:11.338 --> 01:00:16.178
The sense of fulfillment and satisfaction will overcome

01:00:16.338 --> 01:00:20.778
all your problems, specially your left Vishuddhis.

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.858
Now the second stage would be

01:00:34.058 --> 01:00:39.858
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

01:00:50.978 --> 01:00:54.738
where there will be no mistakes.

01:00:54.763 --> 01:00:56.818
Whatever you will do

01:00:57.018 --> 01:01:01.538
may appear to be a mistake, will turn out to be all right.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.770
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

01:01:11.963 --> 01:01:15.883
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:19.243
they think I'm saying it to them.

01:01:31.283 --> 01:01:35.363
Now for example, today I had My watch,

01:01:35.563 --> 01:01:39.723
I wanted to set My watch, so I pulled this screw up,

01:01:39.883 --> 01:01:42.563
say, simple thing.

01:01:48.323 --> 01:01:51.443
Now this I did, I would say, in a way unconsciously,

01:01:51.643 --> 01:01:55.003
but quite consciously.

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:03.603
Because watch stopped and I knew the time,

01:02:03.843 --> 01:02:06.763
what time I have to be there for puja.

01:02:14.243 --> 01:02:19.403
So consciously I put Myself against Myself.

01:02:30.443 --> 01:02:37.043
If the watch had not stopped, I would have come earlier.

01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:44.203
But that was not the time I had to come.

01:02:48.283 --> 01:02:54.083
So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped.

01:03:02.283 --> 01:03:05.723
So whatever mischief you play,

01:03:05.923 --> 01:03:10.003
you know and you can play it against yourself also.

01:03:17.163 --> 01:03:19.883
And then you can make a drama.

01:03:20.483 --> 01:03:25.443
"Oh, I made a mistake!" and things like that, for nothing at all.

01:03:31.723 --> 01:03:36.043
But such a stage is far off. I must tell you.

01:03:38.923 --> 01:03:43.163
Just now the stage at which we are,

01:03:43.363 --> 01:03:45.923
we are still making lots of mistakes

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:50.643
because we are not Self-conscious.

01:04:03.003 --> 01:04:04.963
In a gross way we understand

01:04:05.163 --> 01:04:07.003
this word self-consciousness like this:

01:04:07.203 --> 01:04:09.243
When a person has to go for an interview

01:04:09.443 --> 01:04:11.323
then, he selects his suit properly,

01:04:11.523 --> 01:04:13.643
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:18.523
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

01:04:28.403 --> 01:04:31.283
But when it is the question of your ascent,

01:04:31.483 --> 01:04:35.043
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

01:04:35.243 --> 01:04:38.403
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

01:04:38.603 --> 01:04:42.163
put us in the cradle and take us there.

01:04:42.692 --> 01:04:46.332
This is being childish!

01:04:52.852 --> 01:04:57.172
You have to mature in your ascent.

01:05:03.732 --> 01:05:07.532
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

01:05:08.652 --> 01:05:13.452
Face yourself every day!

01:05:17.012 --> 01:05:21.572
In reality, see how much time you spend about

01:05:21.772 --> 01:05:27.612
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

01:05:48.572 --> 01:05:52.532
Have you left everything, all your worries

01:05:52.732 --> 01:05:56.212
to God Almighty?

01:06:00.932 --> 01:06:06.972
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

01:06:11.212 --> 01:06:18.972
Have you come out all the way, leaving everything that was nonsensical?

01:06:29.612 --> 01:06:33.532
And how do I relate to others?

01:06:33.732 --> 01:06:39.772
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

01:06:44.972 --> 01:06:51.052
I am surprised sometimes, if the one Sahaja Yogi is attacked

01:06:51.252 --> 01:06:54.532
by a non-Sahaja Yogi that

01:06:54.732 --> 01:07:01.492
a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi.

01:07:18.172 --> 01:07:21.372
Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up

01:07:21.532 --> 01:07:25.092
pays more attention to the negative people

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:28.652
than to the positive.

01:07:42.572 --> 01:07:45.452
He relates better to the people who are negative

01:07:45.652 --> 01:07:48.332
than to the people who are positive.

01:07:51.532 --> 01:07:55.012
He is more friendly and open with the negative persons

01:07:55.212 --> 01:07:57.932
than with the positive.

01:08:04.156 --> 01:08:08.316
You have to cling on to the positive.

01:08:10.996 --> 01:08:17.596
But it's always the other way round because also is a very subtle ego in there.

01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:27.356
All these subtle understandings

01:08:27.596 --> 01:08:30.636
I have told you many a times.

01:08:38.876 --> 01:08:43.516
But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine,

01:08:43.756 --> 01:08:46.676
like a spoiled computer,

01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:49.436
you can reach some conclusions

01:08:49.636 --> 01:08:54.596
out of what I have said which are just contrary.

01:09:10.516 --> 01:09:13.876
Like, supposing I say, "You forget the past."

01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:16.316
A simple thing.

01:09:17.076 --> 01:09:22.996
That means you forget everything that is good of the past?

01:09:25.196 --> 01:09:27.836
That is as if you should not understand

01:09:28.036 --> 01:09:31.076
why you're behaving like this?

01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:42.076
Forget the past means don't allow the past to overpower you.

01:09:47.236 --> 01:09:53.756
A brain, which is simple, which is straightforward,

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:57.836
which has got love in it,

01:09:58.036 --> 01:10:03.396
can understand what I am saying straightforward.

01:10:13.356 --> 01:10:18.596
This complicated brain is to be put right,

01:10:20.756 --> 01:10:26.436
and the best way is to stop thinking.

01:10:27.796 --> 01:10:31.396
Just stop thinking.

01:10:33.196 --> 01:10:36.916
That's what you have to do.

01:10:40.396 --> 01:10:47.796
Now when you stop thinking you feel that nothing can be done.

01:10:55.636 --> 01:10:59.796
But by thinking only you don't do anything.

01:11:01.516 --> 01:11:06.156
Now for example, I have to give you a speech now,

01:11:08.236 --> 01:11:11.836
but I start thinking about it, what will you hear?

01:11:11.996 --> 01:11:15.836
Can you hear My thinking?

01:11:21.396 --> 01:11:26.516
You have to, say, enlighten these lights, all right?

01:11:26.756 --> 01:11:29.156
Then you just start thinking about it,

01:11:29.356 --> 01:11:32.236
"I have to enlighten."

01:11:36.156 --> 01:11:40.116
Will it get enlightened?

01:11:41.276 --> 01:11:48.716
This is to be understood, that by thinking you do not do it.

01:11:55.796 --> 01:11:59.636
Thinking is lazy man's garb,

01:12:06.036 --> 01:12:09.876
and is used to avoid work.

01:12:11.756 --> 01:12:16.156
Once I asked a lady I had in the house

01:12:16.356 --> 01:12:22.116
that "We are going out. Will you be cooking something for us?"

01:12:22.316 --> 01:12:26.276
When we came back she had not cooked anything.

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:35.996
I used to cook every day but she had not cooked anything.

01:12:36.876 --> 01:12:43.076
I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook something for us?"

01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:48.796
She said, "I thought You may eat outside."

01:12:51.356 --> 01:12:54.316
She was a western lady.

01:12:56.196 --> 01:13:01.516
So my husband said, "All right, we are going to eat outside. You stay at home."

01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:04.756
I said, "It doesn't look nice." He said,

01:13:04.956 --> 01:13:10.076
"No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself."

01:13:19.636 --> 01:13:24.116
So this is the escape which, you have learnt before,

01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:27.316
the cleverness.

01:13:37.996 --> 01:13:43.156
So you do not argue about it.

01:13:43.356 --> 01:13:47.036
Do not argue about Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:53.836
You do not argue with your leaders.

01:13:55.276 --> 01:13:59.756
You may be his wife, but don't argue.

01:14:01.516 --> 01:14:04.636
We are having a very bad time from some of the wives

01:14:04.796 --> 01:14:09.596
of the leaders because they try to influence the husbands.

01:14:09.796 --> 01:14:12.396
As far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

01:14:12.636 --> 01:14:16.396
they have nothing to do with that.

01:14:27.156 --> 01:14:28.916
Supposing you are working in an office

01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:31.836
and the husband is some great official

01:14:32.036 --> 01:14:37.036
and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband?

01:14:48.476 --> 01:14:54.916
In this case the women have to nourish the organization,

01:14:55.076 --> 01:15:00.996
nourish the husband with love

01:15:08.516 --> 01:15:12.756
from their heart and not from their brains.

01:15:20.356 --> 01:15:26.836
I think it's so great to have been born as a woman Myself,

01:15:27.036 --> 01:15:33.516
because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions.

01:15:46.116 --> 01:15:49.836
The emotions of My love,

01:15:51.716 --> 01:15:56.076
the working and the play of My love.

01:16:01.316 --> 01:16:03.636
It's so great

01:16:03.836 --> 01:16:09.516
that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can.

01:16:15.716 --> 01:16:18.156
So the women should not feel degraded

01:16:18.316 --> 01:16:21.596
if they have to look after the heart,

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:36.956
but they are in a higher, in a way,

01:16:37.116 --> 01:16:40.676
in a higher aspect.

01:16:43.676 --> 01:16:48.916
You can do without thinking but you cannot do without the heart.

01:16:51.236 --> 01:16:56.916
So the ladies should not argue

01:16:59.036 --> 01:17:03.316
with their husbands if they are leaders,

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:10.996
and also one should not argue otherwise, also.

01:17:16.196 --> 01:17:19.836
Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative,

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:22.196
the men become deaf.

01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:27.676
They just don't listen what women are talking.

01:17:37.836 --> 01:17:40.396
If they are very aggressive, then the men

01:17:40.596 --> 01:17:45.396
become absolutely shut up.

01:17:52.756 --> 01:17:56.236
So in relationship with each other,

01:17:56.436 --> 01:17:58.756
you must behave in a natural way

01:17:58.956 --> 01:18:03.876
that you are a man and you are a woman.

01:18:09.516 --> 01:18:14.476
You should become more a woman and more a man

01:18:18.276 --> 01:18:22.116
and then you will see the fun.

01:18:22.796 --> 01:18:25.956
Imagine in this world if there were only men or only women,

01:18:26.156 --> 01:18:28.676
what would have happened?

01:18:39.396 --> 01:18:44.836
So we have to know that in our awareness

01:18:45.036 --> 01:18:50.196
we have to be conscious how far we have achieved

01:18:50.396 --> 01:18:59.596
the consciousness for our relationship with each other,

01:19:07.436 --> 01:19:14.636
that is the collective consciousness of Virat, of the brain,

01:19:18.436 --> 01:19:21.716
that is of Sahasrara.

01:19:22.876 --> 01:19:30.076
So in principle Sahasrara is Vishnu Tattwa,

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:43.716
but the Deity is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

01:19:48.516 --> 01:19:56.196
So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:03.876
All the powers of Shri Vishnu have to act

01:20:04.076 --> 01:20:10.156
according to the Deity, surrender at the Lotus Feet of the Deity.

01:20:16.516 --> 01:20:21.116
So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:25.916
absolutely in the hands of the Deity.

01:20:34.436 --> 01:20:40.236
I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity,

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:47.996
it's too much, because it may fill you up with awe.

01:21:00.036 --> 01:21:12.036
So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out.

01:21:19.236 --> 01:21:24.356
They say, "Surrender your Sahasrara to this Deity."

01:21:29.996 --> 01:21:33.676
And it's so, so simple for you,

01:21:33.876 --> 01:21:38.276
because you have the Deity,

01:21:38.516 --> 01:21:42.956
you have your own Sahasrara, and it's only you,

01:21:43.116 --> 01:21:47.316
the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times,

01:21:47.516 --> 01:21:50.356
have seen that Deity.

01:22:08.236 --> 01:22:11.476
They say that you have to ask for three things

01:22:11.716 --> 01:22:15.196
called salokya, samipya, sanidhya from God;

01:22:15.396 --> 01:22:20.676
meaning to see God, salokya;

01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:23.836
samipya, the closeness with God

01:22:24.036 --> 01:22:29.236
and sanidhya is the companionship of God.

01:22:39.116 --> 01:22:44.236
But you have got tadatmya, is oneness with Me

01:22:50.836 --> 01:22:53.996
which is not in the concept of any one

01:22:54.196 --> 01:22:59.076
of the yogis and the saints and the seers who have been before.

01:23:06.396 --> 01:23:11.996
And this tadatmya you have when you are outside My body,

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:22.436
while they have this tadatmya when they are inside My body,

01:23:22.676 --> 01:23:25.236
they are no more.

01:23:42.196 --> 01:23:49.996
Now, So you should understand the time limit.

01:23:54.716 --> 01:23:58.916
You must understand your greatness

01:24:02.076 --> 01:24:07.116
and you must understand how you people

01:24:07.316 --> 01:24:15.756
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

01:24:24.756 --> 01:24:28.836
So now there's no time for lethargy.

01:24:31.396 --> 01:24:36.796
Now you have to rise and awake.

01:24:42.676 --> 01:24:46.236
Today is the day when I hope

01:24:46.436 --> 01:24:50.671
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:03.107
But only by effort you will stay there,

01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:06.701
otherwise you'll again slip down.

01:25:16.141 --> 01:25:18.661
So go through this lecture again and again,

01:25:18.861 --> 01:25:21.541
and do not think about it.

01:25:32.981 --> 01:25:38.621
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

01:25:40.381 --> 01:25:42.541
For all of you,

01:25:42.741 --> 01:25:45.141
each of you,

01:25:45.581 --> 01:25:48.301
and you must know yourself

01:25:48.501 --> 01:25:52.861
how far you are going every day.

01:26:02.581 --> 01:26:07.541
Today is a special day of Sahasrara.

01:26:09.901 --> 01:26:14.581
Actually, if you see, it is according

01:26:14.781 --> 01:26:18.541
to the sun calendar,

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:22.941
Sahasrara would have been tomorrow.

01:26:27.661 --> 01:26:31.901
It's a Monday, which is the Sahasrara

01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:40.381
and just imagine that we are having it one day earlier.

01:26:43.941 --> 01:26:50.701
So one has to know that the calendar of God

01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:55.194
has nothing to do with the human calendar.

01:27:04.241 --> 01:27:06.441
and some think I should have come

01:27:06.641 --> 01:27:10.761
at least two thousand years back,

01:27:14.721 --> 01:27:17.401
in this form.

01:27:18.121 --> 01:27:24.401
So the calendar is all right, timing is all right,

01:27:24.601 --> 01:27:28.281
everything is all right.

01:27:33.161 --> 01:27:38.441
You are not robots, you are not machines,

01:27:40.441 --> 01:27:47.161
you are evolved through evolutionary process.

01:27:49.281 --> 01:27:53.361
And through evolutionary process only

01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:57.961
you have to achieve the higher personality.

01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:11.561
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

01:28:11.761 --> 01:28:17.681
it's you who have to show the results.

01:28:29.481 --> 01:28:37.241
We may take your Sahasrara

01:28:37.441 --> 01:28:43.121
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

01:28:52.081 --> 01:28:59.121
So you have to know that whatever heights

01:28:59.321 --> 01:29:04.321
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

01:29:04.521 --> 01:29:08.681
with full will power and action.

01:29:26.681 --> 01:29:30.681
May God bless you!

01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:36.561
This lecture is a concern of your Mother.

01:29:36.761 --> 01:29:42.081
Do not take it as anything ill.

01:29:55.481 --> 01:29:58.361
I could not have said this even two years back

01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:02.481
or one year back, because you are at the stage

01:30:02.681 --> 01:30:06.161
where I can say these things to you.

01:30:13.361 --> 01:30:16.281
You can understand it, but

01:30:16.481 --> 01:30:19.641
it has to become your consciousness.

01:30:27.761 --> 01:30:31.521
The stage has reached to understand,

01:30:31.721 --> 01:30:34.801
but it should become your consciousness.

01:30:35.001 --> 01:30:39.921
By today's happening should become, if you keep it there.

01:30:49.721 --> 01:30:53.601
So, again, may God bless you!
