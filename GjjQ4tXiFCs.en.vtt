The Creation of NIPC
July 2005 -New Jersey USA

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:08.852
NIPC was originally known as the
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi World Foundation

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:15.188
I would like to announce and therefore
it is a very unique and very auspicious

00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:24.948
day today that the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi  Sahaja
Yoga Foundation has been created today

00:00:24.948 --> 00:00:33.028
and is going to be signed tomorrow. So
I would like you to give a big big clap.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:41.188
NIPC is Shri Mataji Corporation. It is Her
company. It is a legal entity that our beloved

00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:49.828
Mother was the president is the president&nbsp; and always will be the president to guide us.

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:58.308
NIPC was established under the direction of the
Adi Shaki on the 21st of July 2005. Its purpose

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:05.108
is to preserve, protect and distribute our beloved
Mother's sacred knowledge which is Her teachings,

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:12.548
lectures, writings and all recordings made in
Her presence. She transferred this intellectual

00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:22.868
property to NIPC on the 16th of September 2005. It
is the most auspicious and most precious company in

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:30.148
the history of mankind. It is beyond value.
It is a unique gift that will be there till

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:38.868
the end of time. This is the first time that the original teachings of an incarnation

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:49.268
could be recorded and then preserved and
safeguarded. This is this was never possible in

00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:59.908
the history of man. So NIPC is the first entity
ever that holds the treasure of the full teachings

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:05.348
not only of a Divine Incarnation but
of the Incarnation of Shri Adi Shakti Herself.

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:13.348
As we celebrate this 20 years of anniversary,
we are reminded of the impact and the importance

00:02:13.348 --> 00:02:21.988
of our mission. Each digital archive,
each restored speech, each shared teaching

00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:29.828
is a testament to the commitment to preserve,
propagate the essence of spiritual knowledge,

00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:40.628
spiritual awakening for the future generations.
Shri Mataji, these are the documents representing

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:49.668
all of your talks and tapes. All of the talks
you've given over the years, 35 years of your

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:58.388
knowledge and teachings, the sacred knowledge
of Sahaj Yoga that you've given to us.

00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:04.228
Now this foundation will manage them, will
modernize them and keep them forever and

00:03:04.228 --> 00:03:09.508
spread Your message throughout the world.
It's a very historic responsibility. Now

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:24.228
what you have to do is to authorize them.
Do you have signed that? Yes. Yeah. And

00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:27.508
what you write in?

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.508
Nirmala

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:32.638
It's okay. Okay.

00:03:32.638 --> 00:03:34.638
Nirmala is ok

00:03:34.638 --> 00:03:36.638
Nirmala

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:48.788
Is it okay? It's okay. Same here. Yeah.

00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:59.268
two 3,000 talks Shri Mataji they will all now

00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:06.868
be preserved by this foundation and
it will be spread around the world.

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:09.273
Thank you

00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:13.893
Shri Mataji on behalf of the Sahaja Yogis
of all the world

00:04:13.893 --> 00:04:16.358
and the people of all the world

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:21.862
the World Foundation, Your foundation
the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga Foundation

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:26.761
humbly and gratefully accept this
responsibility

00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:37.188
to preserve your talks for all eternity Shri Mataj so they're available
forever and ever for people all around the world.

00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:39.188
Jai Shri Mataji

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:47.508
This is forever and ever. Your word will
reach every corner of the world and it

00:04:47.508 --> 00:04:58.068
will go on and on and on until every human
being has become a Sahaja Yogi. That's the wish.

00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:02.344
20 years ago on the 16th of September in 2005,

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:09.211
a truly significant moment in the history of Sahaja Yoga occurred when Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:13.440
granted Her intellectual property to the recently formed

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:22.288
Nirmal Intellectual Property Corporation
or NIPC.  In so doing, She ensured that Her Holy

00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:26.145
words and sacred knowledge would be preserved

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:30.758
and protected for future generations of seekers&nbsp;&nbsp;all over the world.

00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:37.828
 Mother told us at that
time, you have it now, you should protect it.

00:05:37.828 --> 00:05:46.548
So since then we develop a lot of work and I'm
sure this work is going to continue protecting but

00:05:46.548 --> 00:05:51.013
also disseminating Her talks to the four corners&nbsp;of the world.

00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:54.068
There are over 3,000 events recorded

00:05:54.068 --> 00:06:04.708
with Shri Mataji some as early as 1972. NIPC's
mission remains to preserve protect and distribute

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:12.868
Her sacred knowledge. Devi Productions does the
work of preservation. Nirmala Vidya is the operating

00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:22.228
arm of NIPC which protects the works amongst many
other assignments. Amruta and the Nirmal Vidya App

00:06:22.228 --> 00:06:29.428
are the distribution platforms. All this task is
tremendous. There's a tremendous responsibility

00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:37.188
and it is a very appropriate moment
to give sincerious appreciation and thanks

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:44.308
to everybody who has been working for this
momentous and and and most relevant and

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:54.068
important task. And it is of course also a moment
to bow in gratitude and and eternal thanks to our

00:06:54.068 --> 00:07:02.468
Divine Mother, for this tremendous gift
to all of us and to humanity. And we are all

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:13.348
working on it to make it available for today
and for tomorrow when perhaps as She once has said

00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:16.618
Her teachings may become the law of men.

00:07:16.618 --> 00:07:30.068
Today&nbsp;NIPC is more than a platform. It is a radiant beacon of Divine love open to all transparent for
all eternity and a universal spiritual treasure.

00:07:30.628 --> 00:07:36.708
Through Her Divine words and infinite
compassion, Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi revealed

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:43.668
the purity at the heart of every great
incarnation. Doras, Moses, Buddha,

00:07:43.668 --> 00:07:51.268
confucius, Jesus and Prophet Muhammad and many
others. Through Her travels across continent,

00:07:51.268 --> 00:08:00.948
She offered humanity the transformative knowledge.
What Rumi called the light beyond all knowledge,

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:09.188
opening the door to mass self-realization. This
is not just truth. It is living Divine reality

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:17.508
confirmed by science felt through Sahaja meditation
and accessible to all seekers of absolute Truth.

00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:29.503
Her Divine presence awaken humanity to truth
its source and inner rebirth all trench in Her&nbsp;Eternal love.

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:39.632
Shri Mataji this knowledge is much greater
than the scriptures like Gita, Bible, Quran etc.

00:08:39.632 --> 00:08:48.671
I was involved since 1988 till 2005 in the work of
Sahaja audio

00:08:48.671 --> 00:09:01.639
and Sahaja video in Delhi for preserving the originals and also making copies and supplying all
over the India for cassettes and CDs.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:06.771
So I thanks Shri Mataji for that opportunity given to me.

00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:10.148
They&nbsp;are asking for your blessings Shri Mataji for the

00:09:10.148 --> 00:09:18.068
for the project of archiving and digitizing all
the old video talks and distributing them amongst

00:09:18.068 --> 00:09:19.123
the world.

00:09:19.123 --> 00:09:19.623
where?

00:09:19.623 --> 00:09:27.802
amongst all the Sahaja Yogis but
also some of them also to non-Sahaja Yogis so that everybody will see your your talks.

00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:37.212
In olden&nbsp;times we used to we used to have video cassettes but now there's a new technology and we are
going to use these DVDs

00:09:37.212 --> 00:09:42.767
and they are going to be distributed and sold to the Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:42.767 --> 00:09:44.413
That's&nbsp;my speech.

00:09:44.672 --> 00:09:53.300
Yes Shri Mataji. This is one that's a DVD that's from one of those. Yes.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.033
And they will last for
a long time. They won't get spoiled by time.

00:09:57.033 --> 00:10:04.228
You know earlier on the technology was not there
but they used to do some quality over time. Now

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:09.986
they have modernized it so that it will remain
as it is good quality for many years.

00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:12.020
In this puja you'll give?

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.816
some of them.

00:10:14.972 --> 00:10:20.283
Yes. We will start
selling now. We will have opened a stand and we will start selling to the Sahaja Yogis

00:10:20.283 --> 00:10:21.695
when?

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:23.372
 from&nbsp;tomorrow

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:31.304
On the occasion of the 20 years of the creation of NIPC we would like to thank all
those who have contributed

00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:35.725
to the preservation&nbsp;&nbsp;of Shri Mataji's legacy,

00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:40.788
and particularly the team
in Austria who under the leadership of Ossi

00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:49.508
created Devi Productions the ship many original
tapes from Italy to Austria, set up operations in

00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:58.148
Aussie and Susie's house, and started the process
of cleaning, digitizing, and editing Mother's

00:10:58.148 --> 00:11:07.828
talks. Over time, thousands of talks, audios, and
videos have been preserved and made available to

00:11:07.828 --> 00:11:14.948
the public. Today, almost 20 years after the
initial setup, the work of Devi Productions

00:11:14.948 --> 00:11:23.188
is still going on. Unfortunately, our dear brother
Ossi passed away, but the new team is active as

00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:31.748
ever in continuing this wonderful work. We are
also remembering our dear brother Wolfgang who

00:11:31.748 --> 00:11:38.228
has always been a very strong supporter of Devi
Productions work and was always ready to find new

00:11:38.228 --> 00:11:44.548
ways to help them. We are Devi Production.
We are the team here, the new current team in

00:11:44.548 --> 00:11:51.108
in Vienna, Austria. I'm Ben. I've been doing
the videos uh the digitizations and producing the

00:11:51.108 --> 00:11:57.188
video content. I'm Anton. I'm the audio guy in the
team and I'm taking care of all the audio tapes.

00:11:57.188 --> 00:12:02.788
Audio tapes digitization and optimization of the
audio material. Hello, I'm Madu. I'm doing the IT

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:08.228
department in the Devi Production. Taking care
of the workstations and the servers so that all

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:12.912
the work that has been digitized remains in the
archive and everything works as it should.

00:12:13.177 --> 00:12:23.181
My name&nbsp;is Eric. I'm from Switzerland and I'm working for
Nirmala Vidya. Nirmala Vidya was created by NIPC in 2011.

00:12:23.428 --> 00:12:30.868
to pursue the mission of preserving
and distributing and protecting all the

00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:38.228
recordings of Shri Mataji and enhance and
make it available for the collectivity to use&nbsp;it

00:12:38.228 --> 00:12:45.988
What I just want to share is that first
it was a great privilege to be in this project

00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:53.828
this amazing project which is there for the future
generation and hopefully for the eternity and

00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:59.508
but the thing is I was hired as a project manager
and you know how it is in the professional world

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:07.828
we plan we organize all what is what Shri Mataji
laughed about it actually and that was really the

00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:13.588
what I learned there is that in Sahaj when you have
projects uh you just have to have the desire and

00:13:13.588 --> 00:13:20.468
the rest is all done by the Divine by the Adi Shakti
like Shri Mataji explained in Delhi She build the house

00:13:20.468 --> 00:13:26.308
not just putting all the ingredients together so
it's the same it was really the same was slowly

00:13:26.308 --> 00:13:32.148
putting all the ingredients the right people for
the right experience with the right knowledge and

00:13:32.148 --> 00:13:40.868
the right attitude and slowly brought us till
today where as you know we have Amuta,

00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:48.068
we have the App where we can connect every day
with Shri Mataji through a speech, through videos,

00:13:48.068 --> 00:13:54.308
but also the production of the book with the Nirmala Vidya Collection Team, the amazing work that

00:13:54.308 --> 00:14:00.308
has been done to preserve all this content.
So it's a beautiful journey and it's not

00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:06.628
finished because the challenge are big now is to
how to make use of all this knowledge to make it

00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:13.588
available also for the seekers properly to use
it properly to use the image properly in most

00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:21.188
respectous way and manner and that's
the challenge also with the advent of AI and

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:26.708
uh that's the job is never ending I would say
and it's not a job actually it's just a blessing

00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:34.148
to be that to be participating to that
project and uh I hope I just can stay in

00:14:34.148 --> 00:14:39.523
the flow of what Mother wants to to be done
from us.

00:14:39.523 --> 00:14:49.348
Hello everyone, my name is Wadi and&nbsp;I've been helping the project since 2013 with
the mobile apps. Hello, my name is Daher. I have

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:55.668
been helping the project since my brother Wy joins
to it. I always try to give a hand and try to do

00:14:55.668 --> 00:15:03.908
whatever is possible. Since 2018, I begin to work
full-time maintaining the apps and creating new

00:15:03.908 --> 00:15:11.908
features like song book, mantra book and also I
joined to work with Radoslaw from Poland and we try to

00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:20.308
keep all the content on Nirmala Vidya apps and Amruta
website updated and we are working on a brand new

00:15:20.308 --> 00:15:27.642
version of the mobile apps okay with a
new design and new features. So please stay&nbsp;&nbsp;tuned.

00:15:27.642 --> 00:15:34.548
With regards to the future. AI artificial
intelligence is already playing a significant

00:15:34.548 --> 00:15:42.548
role and our Sahaja teams are actively exploring
its potential. Unfortunately the other side of

00:15:42.548 --> 00:15:51.748
the coin exists AI artificial insanity where
deep fake videos of Mother are a big concern.

00:15:52.548 --> 00:16:01.268
We urge yogis to stay alert to such mis misuse
and also to those who are monetizing sahaja yoga.

00:16:01.268 --> 00:16:11.028
We humbly ask yogis only to use the NIPC platforms
and the Nirmala Vidya app as they provide authentic

00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:20.228
unaltered teachings of Shri Mataji. Unlike platforms
such as YouTube which may contain edited content

00:16:20.228 --> 00:16:30.228
and disruptive adverts. NIPC preserves the purity
and integrity of Shri Mataji's original messages

00:16:30.228 --> 00:16:41.988
making it the only reliable source. Nirmal
Vidya the spoken and written words of Shri Adi Shakti

00:16:41.988 --> 00:16:46.948
is the ultimate template for the
emancipation and salvation of all of

00:16:46.948 --> 00:16:57.428
humanity to our evolution to our upliftment
to all the solutions of our problems.

00:16:57.428 --> 00:17:07.588
It's the gateway to Her holy lotus
feet. It's the highway to heaven.

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:13.108
It's the key to that golden gate and
it's the meeting place of our Sahasrara

00:17:13.108 --> 00:17:19.348
with that of the Sahasrara of the Virat. We don't

00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:29.588
have the the words the vocabulary to
express that gratitude and thanks.

00:17:29.588 --> 00:17:35.588
But our Holy Mother with Her infinite compassion
and love and forbearance and patience and

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:48.068
generosity accepts our thanks in whatever
meager words which can we can express it. So,

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:55.828
Shri Mataji for all the knowledge and everything
else that you have given us we express our

00:17:55.828 --> 00:18:01.967
heartfelt and deep gratitude to you. Thank
you Shri Mataji.

00:18:01.967 --> 00:18:04.819
Thank you very much and happy&nbsp;&nbsp;anniversary.

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:11.388
So really want to thank all
of you. Thank very importantly Shri Mataji for this beautiful opportunity.

00:18:11.388 --> 00:18:13.682
Thank you, Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:13.682 --> 00:18:16.854
Thank you again to all of you.

00:18:16.854 --> 00:18:18.854
Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:18.854 --> 00:18:20.568
Thank you, Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:29.908
Beloved Mother, it has been the
greatest honor of my life to serve you. It is

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:39.802
with deep gratitude and humility. I thank
you from the very deepest part of my heart. Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:39.802 --> 00:18:45.123
We  honour the memory of our dear brothers Arneua de Kalbermatten,

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:51.546
Gregoire de Kalbermatten, Karan Khurana, Wolfgang Hackl

00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:57.348
