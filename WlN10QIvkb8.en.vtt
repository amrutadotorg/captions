00:18:38.453 --> 00:18:40.853
Now when we know all this,

00:18:40.973 --> 00:18:43.853
still we get caught up on the left side.

00:18:43.973 --> 00:18:46.373
Sahaja Yogis do get caught up.

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:49.813
That's why I think this Mahavira Jayanti

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:54.053
is a very, very great day for us to observe.

00:18:54.173 --> 00:18:56.653
Now why was He called Mahavira?

00:18:56.773 --> 00:19:02.733
Because only a person like Him - Vir means a person who is brave,

00:19:02.853 --> 00:19:07.093
who is chivalrous - because only He could do this.

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:11.413
So only He could enter into the being fully

00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:17.173
and could kill or you can say destroy

00:19:17.293 --> 00:19:20.333
those horrible rakshasas, devils,

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:23.853
all these negative things that come to us.

00:19:24.253 --> 00:19:26.733
Now as you know we use left side very much

00:19:26.853 --> 00:19:30.133
for so many negativity that is torturing us;

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:33.013
but if there is no help,

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:35.973
say, from Mahavira we cannot do it.

00:19:36.093 --> 00:19:38.093
We  call the name of Mahavira -

00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:41.133
you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name,

00:19:41.253 --> 00:19:44.533
but Mahavira because He was a human being.

00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:47.893
All this works out because of Him

00:19:48.013 --> 00:19:50.173
and He is such a great identity.

00:19:50.293 --> 00:19:53.133
He, Himself took a birth as a human being.

00:19:53.253 --> 00:19:57.173
Difficult for saints to take birth as human being.

00:19:57.293 --> 00:20:01.293
Moreover, you see, the

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:06.893
whole concept

00:20:07.653 --> 00:20:11.133
of hell and all that is described

00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:15.613
in any scripture is a fact: it exists.

00:20:16.373 --> 00:20:19.093
And if you try to go in there, you see,

00:20:19.213 --> 00:20:22.053
when I try to go there and to find out,

00:20:22.173 --> 00:20:25.893
I just go off to sleep sort of thing. In My sleep I find out

00:20:26.013 --> 00:20:28.373
all the things that are happening about a person,

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:30.773
how much he's caught up, what he's done.

00:20:30.893 --> 00:20:34.893
It's a - not a easy thing to do with the conscious mind.

00:20:35.013 --> 00:20:37.213
You have to take to the subconscious

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:40.093
and you have to go into sushupti, in a deeper sleep

00:20:40.213 --> 00:20:42.573
to see what's happening in the left side.

00:20:42.693 --> 00:20:46.933
It's a very funny situation, I think,

00:20:47.053 --> 00:20:51.013
and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise it.

00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:54.173
But one should get rid of the problems of the left side

00:20:54.293 --> 00:20:56.333
with the help of Mahavira.

00:20:56.453 --> 00:21:00.053
When this chakra is caught up what you find is a big

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:05.333
lump of bone coming out on the right side.

00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:08.653
So you have to take the name of Mahavira

00:21:08.773 --> 00:21:12.773
just to remove that pressure from the left side.

00:21:12.893 --> 00:21:15.773
Now many people do not even know why they suffer:

00:21:15.893 --> 00:21:18.613
Why should they suffer when they have done nothing wrong?

00:21:18.733 --> 00:21:21.773
Because they are possessed.

00:21:22.133 --> 00:21:24.973
Now even the viruses and all these things

00:21:25.093 --> 00:21:29.333
like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer -

00:21:29.453 --> 00:21:32.613
all, I would say the incurable diseases

00:21:32.733 --> 00:21:37.573
are there because we are triggered into the left side,

00:21:37.773 --> 00:21:41.053
and that's why we are suffering from these diseases

00:21:41.173 --> 00:21:43.773
which are not curable.

00:21:43.893 --> 00:21:46.893
So we have to thank really very much Mahavira

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:49.413
who has given us this power

00:21:49.573 --> 00:21:52.253
to remove our left-sided problems,

00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:58.333
who has given us this light in our hand,

00:21:58.453 --> 00:22:01.613
which He Himself vibrates

00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:06.213
and He, Himself tries to throw some light

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:10.773
on the obscure things - about Me also.

00:22:10.973 --> 00:22:14.933
Because of Him only

00:22:15.173 --> 00:22:19.013
we can get cured

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:23.933
of so many physical and mental troubles.

00:22:24.053 --> 00:22:27.213
You know that the left side can be easily cured

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:30.493
if you use three-candle treatment.

00:22:30.613 --> 00:22:34.333
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light,

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:36.253
He doesn't like darkness.

00:22:36.373 --> 00:22:41.293
And His idea is, I think that way,

00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:46.373
is to now fully go all the way

00:22:46.493 --> 00:22:50.333
to clear the left side as far as possible,

00:22:50.453 --> 00:22:53.533
to help Sahaja Yoga to be established

00:22:53.653 --> 00:22:59.613
in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there,

00:23:00.133 --> 00:23:01.413
lot of it.

00:23:01.533 --> 00:23:03.893
So He is working it out, everywhere,

00:23:04.013 --> 00:23:07.053
and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases

00:23:07.173 --> 00:23:10.413
also we can work it out with candle light and all that,

00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:13.573
with three-candle we can do this treatment.

00:23:13.733 --> 00:23:17.773
So we have to be very thankful to Him

00:23:17.893 --> 00:23:21.493
that He has achieved this kind of entry

00:23:21.613 --> 00:23:24.653
into the left side and has found out for us

00:23:24.773 --> 00:23:30.013
what sort of problems exist on the left side.
