00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.551
Today, she has decided to play to you Darbari Kanada

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:20.796
and the tabla is Mr. Balakrishna this is also

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.994
a surprise to me that from the South Indian

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:34.053
to this, you see, from Aditala to Tritala, it's quite a difference.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:38.465
He speaks Marathi.

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.990
Marathi means you are then finished in music.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.908
Maharashtrians are mad after music, mad.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:51.325
And this is husband of the great artist,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.823
he is another artist's son, I should say.

00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:56.514
May God bless you

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:58.628
Music 48 min, then speech...

00:49:51.123 --> 00:49:55.263
Musician: I will now render a Banarasi Dadra,

00:49:55.288 --> 00:49:59.456
it's a speciality of the place where I come from Banaras.

00:57:30.556 --> 00:57:35.176
Musician: In the end, I will play Bhairavi

00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:40.693
and after that, a small Stuti on Shri Mataji.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.253
I will play just one line.

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:01.390
The next will be a Bhajan.

01:13:01.415 --> 01:13:08.118
The opening words are, ......

01:22:40.450 --> 01:22:48.652
After this very, very beautiful concert,

01:22:50.319 --> 01:22:57.010
I find it very difficult to express the beauty

01:22:57.010 --> 01:23:01.851
that we have enjoyed and the delicacy,

01:23:02.538 --> 01:23:07.730
all the waves of different hues and colors

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.102
is something I feel that after Her realization,

01:23:12.127 --> 01:23:16.879
She has jumped into another realm, definitely.

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:30.571
As if She was pulling every string of my heart all the time,

01:23:36.774 --> 01:23:40.321
with such dignity and balance.

01:23:40.944 --> 01:23:45.366
And all of you absolutely lost in the waves

01:23:46.132 --> 01:23:50.993
of that beautiful rapport you had with Her.

01:23:54.425 --> 01:23:56.977
Our music, I know I have told you

01:23:57.002 --> 01:23:59.161
hundred times, comes from the Spirit.

01:23:59.376 --> 01:24:03.958
And as you have now felt your Spirit,

01:24:04.409 --> 01:24:07.185
you can appreciate the joy.

01:24:07.878 --> 01:24:12.870
And when the Spirit manifests its light

01:24:12.895 --> 01:24:20.864
on these beautiful tunes and melodies,

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:29.321
then it gets a very special type of a vision for all of you.

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:32.635
And I am happy you enjoyed Her thoroughly.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.211
She has got Her realization.

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:37.943
And you are all Sahaja Yogis, so naturally

01:24:37.968 --> 01:24:42.955
there was great relationship also.

01:24:44.953 --> 01:24:50.997
Apart from that, I have discovered one thing more today,

01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:53.816
that South Indians,

01:24:53.841 --> 01:24:57.655
when they take to music, it's not a profession, it's a worship.

01:25:10.023 --> 01:25:13.894
The purity of rendering the art

01:25:14.863 --> 01:25:22.465
is so evident, not in Her, but also with Mr. Balakrishna.

01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:27.702
Both of them, absolutely, the purity of it.

01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:32.773
There is no mixture, there is no cheapness, there is no

01:25:35.133 --> 01:25:39.061
 publicity, or sort of a,

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:45.510
you can say, modulated things.

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:51.699
It's just pure art, in the greatest purity.

01:25:52.246 --> 01:25:55.111
And this is something I discovered today.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.936
We have to learn from South Indians this point,

01:25:57.961 --> 01:26:01.647
 very important, that they render,

01:26:01.672 --> 01:26:04.640
I have seen not here, but even in Madras,

01:26:04.665 --> 01:26:08.185
whether they are dancing, they are playing violin,

01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:10.726
 or they are playing their Mridangam or anything,

01:26:10.751 --> 01:26:13.740
it is for them a worship.

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:17.659
Because of that, the purity is maintained.

01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:21.958
There is no show off, nothing.

01:26:22.276 --> 01:26:26.640
So, so deep.

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:29.922
And today these two artists who are from

01:26:29.947 --> 01:26:34.486
South have learnt all North Indian music.

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:39.059
The rendering is so pure, so pure, I mean.

01:26:39.821 --> 01:26:42.556
I was just thinking of some great artists

01:26:42.581 --> 01:26:46.856
whom I have heard, because I must be the oldest woman here.

01:26:49.254 --> 01:26:56.692
And those who have been really very much,

01:26:57.630 --> 01:27:01.491
in My view, the highest,

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:08.256
or we can call the epitome of our classical North Indian music,

01:27:09.014 --> 01:27:12.103
 have been expressed through them today, definitely.

01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:17.517
No show off, nothing, it's so beautiful.

01:27:17.769 --> 01:27:19.708
And this is what we have to learn,

01:27:19.733 --> 01:27:22.321
that art is a worship.

01:27:22.810 --> 01:27:25.458
It's not a profession.

01:27:27.133 --> 01:27:31.592
Many people say that those who are pujaris of Saraswati

01:27:31.617 --> 01:27:37.674
are always in trouble as far as the Lakshmi is concerned.

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:42.504
But that's your duty to look after their Lakshmi side.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.288
But their duty is to be purely devoted,

01:27:47.313 --> 01:27:51.432
dedicated to the art as a worship.

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.650
And as audience, or you can say as

01:27:55.675 --> 01:27:59.847
people who are enjoying that music, must look after

01:28:00.707 --> 01:28:03.475
 their financial side, their Lakshmi side.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:10.788
And also always respect, respect the artist.

01:28:13.196 --> 01:28:16.308
Artist is to be respected because he is

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:19.797
worshipping the Goddess Saraswati.

01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:24.674
I can't understand how people can be disrespectful.

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:28.958
And in our country especially I have seen now,

01:28:28.983 --> 01:28:33.341
 there is such a big trend towards cheap type of music,

01:28:33.366 --> 01:28:37.867
that they just make fun of art.

01:28:41.433 --> 01:28:44.186
As Sahaja Yogis you have to really

01:28:44.211 --> 01:28:47.300
 understand that this is the music of the Spirit.

01:28:47.325 --> 01:28:49.158
Whether it is North or South Indian,

01:28:49.183 --> 01:28:51.325
I enjoy the same way,

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:53.547
 whether it is South Indian or North Indian music,

01:28:53.572 --> 01:28:56.564
makes no difference to Me.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:08.852
Both are absolutely supreme in their own style and field.

01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:17.190
I don't know what to say about Mrs. Rajam.

01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:20.205
I met her because of her mother-in -law actually.

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:22.930
And then she has developed so much.

01:29:22.930 --> 01:29:26.385
But today she was very much different I felt,

01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:31.806
 very much closer to Me and closer to all of you.

01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:38.877
May God bless you, Mrs. Rajam, your husband and you especially.

01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:44.465
I hope we'll have more chances to listen to your tabla.

01:29:45.757 --> 01:29:49.087
If you are in Bombay, it should be easier for us

01:29:49.112 --> 01:29:51.918
 to get you, because she is in Banaras.

01:29:51.943 --> 01:29:53.958
Doesn't matter.

01:29:57.823 --> 01:30:02.950
We have very small little thing for her.

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:15.323
Something for you is a Maharashtrian saree.

01:30:15.395 --> 01:30:17.745
You always wear South Indian sarees,

01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:20.398
but I hope you'll enjoy this one also.

01:30:30.442 --> 01:30:32.168
And this is for you.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.168
I hope to your height it will fit, I mean.

01:30:35.308 --> 01:30:39.680
Maharashtrians are not that tall, but they make it quite high things.

01:30:39.705 --> 01:30:41.620
Let's see. Oh, it's all right.

01:30:46.955 --> 01:30:51.430
And a small little gift from all of us.

01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:03.125
You have to go to the village and order it, otherwise you don't get it.

01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:04.685
It's very beautiful.

01:31:05.156 --> 01:31:07.172
She has a blouse piece also.
