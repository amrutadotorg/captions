00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:09.138
I must tell you there are certain things of protocol.

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:14.076
When you talk to Me you shouldn’t put your hands like 
this, talk to Me like this. You see, that’s not the way.

00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:17.645
Normally, if you see, Indians always fold their hands, talking to me.

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:23.145
You see, it’s not the way to talk to Me. 
It’s not proper, it’s to- the way you talk here, also.

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:26.308
I think you people use too much of your hand. Otherwise also,

00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:30.948
there’s no need to be using all the time
like this and it looks horrid to me sometimes.

00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:35.295
And then you- some of you talk to Me, you go
on like this, that’s not the way to talk.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.268
Is a sign that you are not normal.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:44.600
In a humble way you must talk [doing
namaste]. All right? This is a protocol.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.174
One must know. Best is to talk with folded hands.

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:53.636
Now, in India they don’t call me Mother at all. Not at all.

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:58.038
Like, “Mother” one calls from there:
“Mother” from there, that’s not the way.

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:00.232
They say, “Shri Mataji”, all of them.

00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:03.462
Nobody calls Me, have you heard anybody calling Me, “Mother”?

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:10.388
So we have to learn these better methods of
addressing, because that helps us. All right?

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:16.308
So, one has to talk with great grace and
understanding, because you know Who I am now.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:21.849
So best thing is to use the proper way of addressing. All right?

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.947
The more protocol if you heard, the better you will be.

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:32.180
You will really benefit very much more,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.940
because as you address Me, the deities
are so alert, they see you, how you behave.

00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:44.749
Very important to be humble. Deities are there, watching all the time,

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:50.344
and they want to see what is your reaction,
how you behave, your protocol, everything.

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:59.416
You have seeing Indians, how they talk. They
have to say something, with eyes little lower,

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:03.055
and they say it- They know Whom they are talking.

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:08.288
Even on the phone, Modi was talking, calling Me, “Shri Mataji”.

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:14.378
Shri Mataji is to be said, not
“Mother, Mother, Mother”. It’s not proper

00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:20.423
– all right? – for Sahaja Yogis, because it’s important
now. New people will be coming: they’ll learn from you.
