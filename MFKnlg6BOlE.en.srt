1
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,208
Let him put Mangala Sutra.

2
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,583
Shri Ganesha has the power to give Mangala Sutra.

3
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,999
Make Me wear this one. Come along.

4
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,417
Thanks.

5
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,166
You have the greatest right.

6
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,000
He turned the other way round,

7
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,417
it is used this way when

8
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,166
there is the first year of the marriage - you see,

9
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:19,291
thats right, that's how it is put.

10
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,417
Just married women.

11
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,417
Married women have to do. Allright.

12
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,542
All the married women and then the kanya

13
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,917
has to do something else.

14
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,875
All of you,

15
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,959
let us have two each otherwise it would be allright.

16
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,542
You can mix them up, no harm.

17
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,667
Wait for all the married women.

18
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,792
You come along.

19
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,291
So here we go.

20
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,500
I didn't bring all My ornaments...

21
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:14,917
That's good.

22
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,500
May God bless you all.

23
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,000
Akhanda saubhagya.

24
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,583
This is the blessing given to all the married women

25
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:32,000
that let your saubhagya remain all your life

26
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,083
without any obstacles.

27
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,250
No obstacles in your married life should be all the time there

28
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,583
till you live.

29
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,208
May God bless you

30
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,750
Now for the kumkum.

31
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,166
You people can come,

32
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,542
and married girls can come!

33
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,250
Keep a little bit for everyone

34
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,583
and take it round

35
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,625
and they can put it on their hands and rub it.

36
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,166
It's good for them.

37
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,709
Gregoire, you read your names that you have made,

38
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,959
where are your names?

39
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,709
Gregoire asks "For Shri Shiva or Shri Mahakali?"

40
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,917
Yes... .Shri Shiva...

41
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,041
All this is for His enjoyment only, isn't it?

42
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:07,792
Again!

43
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,041
Gregoire: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Nav Jerusalemeshwara -

44
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,500
Gregoire: He is the Lord of New Jerusalem

45
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,834
Gregoire: He is the Primordial Self of Shri Mataji.

46
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,125
Gregoire: He is fond of Sahaja yogis

47
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:41,208
So this means that He is the Beloved of the Sahaja yogis,

48
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,417
Gregoire: This is another name, there is another name, Mother, for this,

49
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:05,041
Priya Bhakta, so Priya is first but if you put it last,

50
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,542
you see - Bhakta Priya means He's fond of bhaktas,

51
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,625
you see, Bhakta Priya.

52
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:17,667
But supposing you put it that She is the Beloved,

53
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,291
you see because Priya, where you put it,

54
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:27,417
you see, then it is My name- I am the Beloved.

55
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,875
You can switch it - Premi would be better

56
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:43,417
if you put Premi then it would be all right.

57
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,875
You can put it, Priya will be - Gregoire -

58
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:17,291
Sahaja Yogi Priya it's all right,

59
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,750
but if you put it "Priyaa" then immediately it means

60
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,625
just the other way round because you are addressing,

61
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,083
you are making the thing according to Me

62
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,166
I become that deity, you see?

63
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,333
Sanskrit is tremendous,

64
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,917
little change here and there and makes such a thing

65
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:43,667
because every, every consonant, every vowel has a meaning,

66
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:48,166
can you immagine every consonant and every vowel

67
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,999
has a meaning and has a mantra because it is a devanandra,

68
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,041
it is understood only by the devas,

69
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,333
devanand created by the devas,

70
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,999
so all these have such a tremendous effect when you combine

71
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,041
all these things, you see.

72
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,417
Yogi: I'll read some more names for You Shri Mataji?

73
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:07,166
Allright.

74
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,667
Good, beautiful, yes

75
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,875
The same form in that photograph has come up as light,

76
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,625
have you seen that?

77
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,875
Just like a flame, this form.

78
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:31,458
Oil, Amla, Amla oil?

79
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:48,750
I saw some Khus, Gregoire,

80
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:51,667
in your bathroom I saw some khus,

81
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,959
is khus perfiume.

82
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,999
Khus.

83
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:13,208
I saw one, it has to be "Athar",

84
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,959
you see from India because

85
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,875
let see this one is also "Mogra"...

86
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:35,500
Here the kind of perfumes people use are very dangerous,

87
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,583
especially this "Tabac' is coming from tobacco,

88
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,625
you see sort of people get addicted to it,

89
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:44,500
because it is an addiction.

90
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:58,250
Yes, this is all right, this is all right. This is hina

91
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:09,834
is it written "hina' on that? "Khus, same thing..

92
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:14,041
Just the same. This is allright.

93
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:30,125
You can apply to all the sahaja yogis, this perfume khus.

94
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,250
It is clearing for your vishuddhi,

95
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,542
right vishuddhi especially.

96
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:43,667
Though if you have hina that is the best

97
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:47,083
because that clears out your right vishuddhi very much,

98
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:51,250
but this is good for people who are speedy, heated up...

99
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,458
Let he do it when I hold the sword.

100
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,792
I will hold the sword in this hand (hindi)

101
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,125
108 Names.

102
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,583
Have we got copies of 108 names.

103
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,750
But you can translate it.

104
00:52:56,375 --> 00:53:01,458
Yogi: It's my wife who selected it, I am innocent.

105
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:06,458
You selected it but put the blame on her.

106
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,291
That's why the wives are there to take all the blame

107
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,458
Have to open it the other way round,

108
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,417
open half,

109
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:31,583
that's how, fold it that side

110
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:14,750
This is the way they had it at the time of Shri Krishna

111
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:39,250
Take off My hair from the back and put out My hair.

112
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,625
She's not have the modern watch...

113
00:57:54,583 --> 00:58:00,583
Best combination is green, orange and yellow

114
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:14,625
Flowers are the best above the head...

115
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,875
The sign of beauty is that you cannot

116
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:59,625
tolerate any imperfection anymore.

117
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:03,375
This is very beautiful so you must make everything

118
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:07,667
in relation to that, is to be done. It's done very well.

119
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:41,417
Try to take complete photographs.

120
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:57,625
This I don't need!

121
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,083
You can read that in a stotra words

122
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:53,333
Stand, it has to go down

123
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:06,667
May God bless you all, give yourself a bandhan

124
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:04,208
Say Lord's prayer

125
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:43,667
Once more

126
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,542
Once more
