[APPLAUSE]

00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:01.140
There should be someone to show also; If there's need to show, somebody should come up there and show later on.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.720
It's alright.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:12.280
- I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
- Shri Mataji [GERMAN INTERPRETER]

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:20.320
Yesterday, I told you that Truth is to be discovered

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:25.340
on your Central Nervous system through the evolutionary process

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.020
- not through some imaginary mental projections

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.460
and to believe into something because somebody is telling you

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.720
in a very convincing manner.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.200
Even, you have not to believe Me, what I tell you.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.040
As I said yesterday, you have to treat it like a hypothesis

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.640
and with an open mind of a scientist to discover the Truth yourself.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.060
It is your lookout that you have to be convinced;

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.940
I am not here to convince you

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:49.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:56.300
- or to persuade you to believe into something
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.160
because even if you believe in Me, believe in what I say,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:07.220
if you do not get the experience of Self-realization, it is of no value.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:12.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.520
Now today, as I told you yesterday, how the human awareness, which has got

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:32.340
it's roots in the brain, starts growing downward and takes us to our destruction in every center

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:38.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.720
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:50.340
and unless and until we get the ascent, we, our human awareness can never take us

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:56.040
to that place where we say that this is the Self, the Spirit.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:06.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:14.580
So, every human effort to experience new things or to try new things is nothing

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.820
but amounts to a ego trip -

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:26.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.560
- is not reality.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:39.600
Now today, I would like to tell you what happens if our human awareness moves to the left or to the right.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:46.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.420
Now in our system there is something called Autonomous Nervous System,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:00.020
which means, auto means somebody driven by self.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.900
It is driven by self - autonomous. So, what is this self?

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:23.980
Now, this Autonomous Nervous System is divided into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems within us.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:31.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:38.780
On the subtler level, the left side that you see here, what we call as Ida Nadi, in the Sanskrit language,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.220
manifests the left, the Left Sympathetic Nervous System

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:51.500
and the one which is on the right hand side, which starts from the Swadhishtana - the yellow colored one -

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.760
is the one, what we call as, the Pingala Nadi.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:04.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:16.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:23.380
- It manifests the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:31.660
Now the central path, that you see here half-broken, is the path of Kundalini,

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.820
which, actually, manifests

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:43.600
in us the Parasympathetic Nervous System and is called as Sushumna Nadi in the Sanskrit language.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.160
By the left Nadi, that you see here the blue colored one,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.460
you desire something - is a power of desire.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.520
- It looks after our emotional side
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.980
and is somewhere near Freud's id, we can call it but he was very confused -

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:27.060
but is the one that looks after your past and your conditioning.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.460
So, this is the one that gives you your conditioning or your past.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:48.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:56.540
Now the right side one that you see, the yellow one, is the one that gives you your future

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.580
and this is the one which works on your physical and your mental level

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:23.360
so that you have now - left hand side is emotional and the physical and the mental side on the right side.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.680
I must confess, English language is extremely confusing

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.160
because the one who suffers from the mental side,

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.640
uh.. they say, is actually suffering from the emotional side

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.340
So, let us take an exact word for that, is the

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.820
when we say the mind, we mean the emotional side.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:18.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:25.040
[ASIDE - I think, that will do.] and the Kundalini, you say, is the fourth power within us,

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:31.120
which is coiled up in three and a half coils and is lying in that

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.160
sacrum bone, as we call it, in a sleeping state.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.720
[ASIDE - That will do, I'll manage. It's alright. Thank You.]

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.340
Now we have seen these four powers within us.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:04.920
First is the left side power of desire, right side power of action

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.640
and the central path of our evolution.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:17.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:30.320
Now whatever we have evolved, is shown on our Central Nervous System which records everything.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:37.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:42.700
We can say that all these three powers built-in

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.300
the program of the Central Nervous System.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:54.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:01.760
Now say, for animals, you ask a horse to pass through a dirty lane

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.360
or a dog - he will just go through, he will not have any problems

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.280
but for a human-being, to go through a dirty lane, will be very difficult.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:17.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.960
- [INTERPRETER]
- So, on our Central Nervous System

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:31.040
we have built-in a new capacity to see beauty, to see color, to see uh..

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.880
the dirt and filth, on our Central Nervous System.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.740
Human-beings need not be told that this is smelling dirty - they can smell it.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.340
As in Sanskrit it is said, "Nahin kasturi ka modaha shapathe namo bhavyathe."

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:08.820
The smell of the musk need not be vowed for; It exists, you can see it yourself.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:17.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:24.740
In the same way, our Central Nervous System records all that we have gained

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:30.920
through our past, through our conditioning and also what we think about our future.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:37.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:43.720
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.880
Now, when you start moving towards the left side in your attention,

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.800
you become, sort of, very emotional person.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:58.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:05.300
- Like, we can say, a Greek tragedy
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.660
you indulge into something tragic - you enjoy tragedies.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.520
You are a happily married man still you like to hear the songs of separation.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:25.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.260
You have everything and a nice wife

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.200
but still you are thinking of somebody and unnecessarily you are miserable.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.660
Then this devotion can go to anything - it can go to God also

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:51.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:58.080
- as we call it as bhakti cult.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:03.120
I mean, they will go on saying, "Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama,"

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.920
thousand times, sometimes six thousand times, like mad.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:14.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:20.640
- or like, "Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ," they'll go on.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:27.180
They will just, sort of, without any connection with Christ or without any connection with Ram,

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.240
just imaginary emotions they will start putting on God.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:39.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:45.580
This bhakti cult we had in India much before anywhere it started, I think.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:53.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:59.680
So, they are running on the street, all of them, 'Hare Rama, hare Krishna,' running on the street like mad, has no meaning.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:06.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:14.440
As a result of this kind of a chanting on the left hand side, you develop a kind of a very funny cancer,

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:21.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:27.360
which also can result into a situation, where we call it,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.440
as the Left Vishuddhi catch where you feel unnecessarily guilty.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:39.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:46.140
It becomes a fashion with people to say you're miserable and that you're very guilty, for nothing at all

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:52.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.560
and to say that you must go into misery is the same nonsense that you go to the left side.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:06.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:13.960
You cannot go into any situation yourself and achieve it as far as spirituality is concerned

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:21.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:28.440
but, you must know that the Spiritual ascent is a living process

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.900
and is evolutionary process which works spontaneously.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.740
So, going towards left side is even more dangerous than going towards right side.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.500
Left-sided people don't torture others but torture themselves.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:12.900
Now the area they entered into, first of all, is their past, this past, this life's past.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:18.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:24.020
- Then they enter into their own past
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:31.960
This is a very wrong thing, these days some people have started asking about your past, past - it's a very dangerous area.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:38.720
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:45.860
- Past is finished and gone - it doesn't exist.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:51.040
Now, when you go beyond that, you go into the very, very dangerous area called

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.560
Collective Subconscious area.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:08.140
- From Subconscious to the Collective Subconscious
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.740
- This one, I say, is the most dangerous area.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.140
Now supposing, you were a very right-sided person and you are vulnerable to cancer -

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.320
first thing you'll catch will be cancer

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:33.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.460
because into the, into the Collective Subconscious all that is dead

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.000
since the time of our creation is there within us.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:50.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:57.100
This is all accepted now by the doctors that these cancer is caused by

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:04.060
Protein 52 and Protein 58 which are built within us

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:10.480
in an area about which they don't know - they are very honest - but into the area

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.340
which is within us since our creation - is an accepted fact.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:27.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.540
So, when you start experimenting like this,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.560
even Freud and all this nonsense, when you start experimenting, you go to your left side.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:48.980
Say, as I said, on Vishuddhi chakra, if you go on taking the name of somebody's continuously

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:56.220
then somebody, who is dead with that name in the atmosphere, just enters into your body

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.560
- and you can get completely possessed.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:22.040
Like, somebody who was, he used to take Christ's name and he started feeling he's become Christ.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.940
- and he came to Me he said, "I'm Christ."
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:41.620
- I said, 'Alright, then walk on the water.'
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.920
- 'If you can do that I will believe it.'
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:54.500
So, this is what happens like Gauguin, now a great artist as you know him, died as a mad man and

00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:03.040
somebody who used to copy him and used to think of him all the time, read about him, suddenly he started painting like Gauguin.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:22.120
Nothing new but the same thing he was putting on the canvas and I saw this on a television

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.060
show that he was saying, "I am possessed by Gauguin."

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:35.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:42.780
Now many people think that, if they are born and they can tell about their past - it is their own past.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:50.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:58.500
It is not necessary that it is your own past, it might be some possession is sitting on you and you are telling your past.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:08.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.800
and it may be the past of that person who died.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:24.160
Now this possession business is so secretive and so dangerous that people have no idea about it.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.240
It is a special art, which is practiced in India and everywhere as witchcraft,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:46.000
by which people get hold of these dead spirits and put them on others and try to capture them.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:52.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:03.360
- It may be called as black magic or anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:09.260
- Most of the gurus try this trick
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.000
- and they possess the people
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.940
so much so, that people become absolutely mad, give away all their money,

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.260
give away everything they have and they don't see that this man is just exploiting them.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:30.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:41.460
Ultimately, there can be a complete suicide of all the people they can take to

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:47.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.760
or there may be people, individuals who might get into epilepsy.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:03.300
- Epilepsy is a sign of possession
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:11.260
- and such a man is not within himself.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:17.020
He might get such a terrible power within himself that even ten people cannot control.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:30.220
The other day, I saw a child of one year possessed and three people could not hold her and were perspiring.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:39.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:45.580
This is what happens when you get possessed by some sort of a devilish personality.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:51.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:58.220
Many people, who become mad or all them who become mad, are possessed.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:04.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Even Schizophrenia comes from the same.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:16.980
All disturbances of the mental level, so called mental, I mean the emotional level, are from this possession.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:27.680
Suddenly, a person starts screaming or shouting or behaving in a different manner

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.200
it doesn't explain - it is nothing but a possession.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:40.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.080
Many people ask Me, why in America there is so much schizophrenia?

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.040
Because so many of these Indians were killed by Spanish.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:02.320
- [INTERPRETER]
- Maybe they are possessing.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:09.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Specially the people who have been to Vietnam are possessed people, absolutely.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.520
They are very abnormal and

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.260
very sly and always running away from society.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:29.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:36.660
- Also some of the drugs take you to the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.740
- Alcohol also takes you to the left side;
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.400
Excessive alcohol drinking can really make you a mad man.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.520
So, all these things lead you to the left side and you suffer from

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.960
not only mental troubles but also physical troubles.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:08.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:15.420
- Such a person always is very lethargic.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:23.320
He doesn't want to work, he wants to sleep all the time and he is not very neat or clean

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:30.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:36.240
and if you try to organize such a person, he gets very annoyed, can be extremely violent.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:43.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:51.800
Now you, one can go through chakras and chakras and see how on every chakra there is a possibility of your movement to the left side.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:58.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:04.400
For example, if you are suddenly frightened by someone or you have a very frightful experience

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:13.020
and you are absolutely lost, that time you can go to the left side and you can

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:17.220
catch it, the way, what we call, the possession.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:23.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.980
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:36.000
Say for example, you parents have been not kind to you or you had a very bad childhood

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.180
when in as childhood, when the child needed the attention of the mother and

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.700
father and love from them, he was ill-treated,

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:51.600
then the child can become extremely left-sided or right-sided depending on his temperament

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.620
but when he's left-sided, he develops very funny symptoms.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:01.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:07.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:15.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:22.900
People achieve it also by giving you wrong type of food which is being done by with some sort of a black magic;

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.700
When you eat that food, you can go to the left side and you can get possessed.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:37.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:43.780
Some of the gurus give those ashes which actually come from the crematoriums.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.140
Such people can suffer from terrible skin troubles.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:57.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:04.740
It is such a secretive knowledge that it is not easy for you to understand unless and until you get your realization.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:19.200
On the Swadhisthana Chakra, it could be a person who is a very, very dynamic person,

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:26.680
who is showing good results in art or in creativity, can be over-doing everything,

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:32.320
is exerting too much onto that or going into it's imagination, may be caught up or

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:37.220
maybe, somehow or the other, cursed by someone, so he stops all his activity.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:44.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:51.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:59.020
So, when we start experimenting, we should know that with human awareness, either you'll go to the left or to the right.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:07.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.820
The best way people achieve mesmerism is through their eyes.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:19.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:25.500
They ask a person to look into his eyes and then somehow or other, try to possess that person.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:30.320
or could be, that this Agnya Chakra they can turn it in such a way that

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:34.200
in the opposite direction, so that the person gets possessed.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:40.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:46.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:52.780
The worst is the possession on the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the lowest chakra here, on your sex.

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:59.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.500
Many gurus or many people use this chakra to entice people and then it is

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.600
very difficult to get these people out of that.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:16.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.140
We stand in great danger because we do not know what one will do to us and when we start

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.760
in darkness some sort of an experiment, it's a very, very dangerous sign.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:34.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:41.100
- [INTERPRETER]
- So it is very important, before you take to any such experiments,

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:47.000
you must first find out the disciples of such a guru or the people who are around such a guru,

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:54.620
how are they, how do they look like, are they knowledgeable? How, what is their lifestyle, what sort of people they are?

00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:03.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:08.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:15.840
But human-beings are dare-devils and they try to do things which can be very injurious.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:21.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:31.800
Like, I would say, we see a person coming out of a pub, who just falls off of over-drinking

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:35.420
and we try to, sort of, again go into the pub.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:44.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:53.020
All the chakras can be affected by Mooladhara, if you're caught up on Mooladhara, and then you develop all these diseases

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:58.260
like Parkinson, Mellitus, all these degenerating things.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:05.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:12.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:17.160
So, any kind of extreme behavior can lead you to the left or to the right.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:23.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:30.440
So, before starting any experiment, you must see the person who is started the experiment, where is he.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:38.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.940
Now, say, for example Freud - he was epileptic, he had cancer

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:50.700
and he was a funny man as far as the mother was concerned, so still people followed him.

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:00.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:05.460
And some people followed him to such an extent that they replaced him with Christ.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:11.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:18.220
Even if somebody says that, "We are very religious people, we are very spiritual people," you must see what sort of life they lead.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:25.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:31.340
- Are they normal people or are they abnormal?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.060
Now, to the right side now. The movement starts on the right side of our awareness.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:41.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:49.360
As I told you, is the action - on the right side we perform through our physical and mental activity - for our future also.

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:58.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:05.920
Now on the physical side, supposing, somebody starts over-doing something, then what happens to a person like that.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:17.260
- For example, take jogging.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.640
It's very common disease nowadays - everybody is running on the road.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:27.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:34.540
- Everybody is trying to become a cinema actor.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.860
Now, what we have to understand that jogging is only physical exercise

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.860
and if you overdo it, you will develop physically but what about your emotional side?

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.380
You will seldom find a happy jogger - they're always miserable.

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:06.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.400
There will be a fight between the wife, maybe a divorce after sometime.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:23.040
I met one dentist. He told Me, "Now, I've become absolutely a saint." I said, "How?" He said, "I've been jogging, jogging

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:30.900
now I don't feel anything. I didn't feel the death of my child, I didn't feel the death of my wife, nothing I feel - I've become a yogi."

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:39.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:50.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:55.800
- And he was thin like a bean stick, I tell you,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:00.720
and still he was trying to jog because the habit he could not give up.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.460
His, I mean, his bones used to run on the streets - the skeleton.

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:13.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:19.740
He could not give up that habit despite that he'd lost all his weight.

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:31.960
Same thing with any physical exercise if you do indiscriminately - for example, take Hatha yoga.

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:38.700
If you start doing Hatha yoga, every type of asana without understanding what is your problem, where the Kundalini is stopping,

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:44.420
you indiscriminately start doing Hatha yoga, you might develop terrible problems of the heart

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:53.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:59.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.520
and one becomes a very fiery person, extremely angry, hot-tempered

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:08.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.600
- and very dry.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.800
They have no love, they have no tolerance, they cannot bear anything.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:26.880
I would say some French - you can meet them - because they eat lot of fungus, their liver goes out

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.700
and then they are all the time thinking, thinking, thinking.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:36.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.500
- They eat every kind of fungus.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.560
There are 200 type of cheese they have got which has got fungus in it.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.260
I mean, if you put a little fungus on your hand, all your life you cannot get rid of it - it's so horrid.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.520
So now, when we start thinking too much,

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.740
on the mental side what happens to our body?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.360
- We think of the future.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.920
Telescopic we become, we become very speedy.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:38.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:45.640
Like you see, if there's a train coming, such a person has to arrive at the station which is,

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.420
say at A point; He will reach at B point where the train doesn't stop.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:57.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.960
- They go on thinking, thinking like mad -
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.100
- produce no results
- [INTERPRETER]
- and this is so maddening

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.660
that such a person can become extremely dry.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:29.800
- and this dryness can have effect on all the chakras.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:37.400
- Like, on the Mooladhara he becomes a constipated person;
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:45.120
- He develops all the problems of constipation;
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then he has too much heat in the body;

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:51.320
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then at Swadhishthana he develops a very bad liver;

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:59.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Liver becomes absolutely dried up;
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:06.140
Liver is the one that takes away all our poison and passes on to the water of the blood

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:13.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:20.880
but when there is not sufficient water, the heat remains there and liver starts troubling such a person and he develops horrible things like

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.680
like, biliousness and ultimately cirrhosis of the liver.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:39.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:45.420
So, the liver starts spoiling, spoiling your attention and you cannot enjoy anything, you don't like anything.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:52.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:58.220
You cannot eat much, you feel giddy and if you sit in the Sun or anything,

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.140
you becomes really, absolutely burnt up.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:10.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:18.140
Now, this yellow line is called also Surya Nadi - means the uh.. channel of the Sun.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:32.500
- These right-sided people are very much fond of the Sun also
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:38.700
They go to the sea-shore and burn their skins in addition to what they have already burnts inside.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:46.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.840
- and develop cancer of the skin.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:57.560
It is another way of futuristic thinking gives you a very serious trouble of attack all heart attack.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:04.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.820
- which is, which has a spiritual significance.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:14.620
A person, who is extremely aggressive and extrovert, his attention is always outside

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:25.740
- and not on his heart, not on his Spirit.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.800
As a result of that, Spirit sleeps off and he gets a massive heart attack.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:38.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:47.420
There's another thing, as I told you, that one can develop Diabetes and all those things because of too much of aggressiveness.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:01.040
But the aggressiveness of the tongue gives you all kinds of problems of the Vishuddhi, here.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:08.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:15.620
If you shout too much and if you aggress people by your talking, try to put them down

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:23.840
by your talking, try to take their charge by your talking, sharpness, you develop all the problems of the right Vishuddhi.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:30.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.280
Now, if husband is a shouting person, the wife becomes deaf

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.960
but husband himself suffers from terrible coughing,

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.480
cold and all kinds of bronchial troubles

01:06:54.740 --> 01:07:01.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:09.120
- and then he becomes vulnerable to the cancer also.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:17.360
Somehow, if he's triggered by this Protein 52 or 58, then he gets the throat cancer.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:25.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:33.800
- [INTERPRETER]
- So he removes his gullet, he removes his nose, he removes his tongue - goes on removing one after another.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:41.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:47.060
This is what is up to Vishuddhi chakra but Agnya is the most dangerous.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:54.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.920
The masters of this black magic use their Agnya

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:05.780
- [INTERPRETER]
- through their eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.940
These people when they use their Agnya chakra that way

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:16.280
before death, they have to go through Hell as far as their body is concerned.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:24.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:29.960
- They may develop all kinds of allergies
- [INTERPRETER]

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:34.220
or they may develop all kinds of

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:39.380
heating problems like blisters - their body will blister out.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:46.980
- [INTERPRETER]
- Their head may burst out with heat.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.940
- [INTERPRETER]
- They may have their brain damages, paralysis.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.580
- This is only the physical side that happens
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.520
but mentally also the people, who are right sided can become horrid.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:16.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.620
- They become very aggressive.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:26.240
Like when they are possessed, you see, an idea can come into their heads that, "Let us become aggressive," you see,

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:31.940
fascist, they become fascist or they can become very right-sided people.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.300
We can say, as we have in London nowadays they, they have shaven their hair and all that,

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:42.900
they have no marriages, nothing but they find anybody of a black color - they just strangle that person.

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:51.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:01.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.980
They aggress others, all the time they aggress by some sort of a funny doing.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:11.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:19.380
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.440
- Very embarrassing!
- [LAUGHTER]

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.800
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:49.300
- At the right moment things happen, you know.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:09.080
- We were getting rather serious, so we needed something like that.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:17.440
So, as we see now, all these things happen to us when we try to go to the right.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.500
As I said, when we aggress others, you see, now, when we start aggressing others, we destroy others.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.860
- But we are part and parcel of the whole.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:46.160
If you destroy anything in that Whole, that the Whole thing then, you are destroying yourself as well.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:51.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.520
So, we think that by aggressing others we are not harmed - you are very much harmed.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:03.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.700
Whatever you give to others, goes round that person and comes back to you.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.420
Now, a person who always says, "I hate you, I will kill you," all that,

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:26.100
may die with a very harsh hands himself.

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:31.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:34.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:41.260
- Such a man is always hated - no one likes him.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:45.100
But the, on the subtler level what happens to you

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:50.200
is on this thing, that such people sometimes lose their voices completely - they can't talk

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:57.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:05.780
- and could be that they, they  can not ascend at all.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:14.120
In the brain, as you can cut the  brain you can see in the transverse section of the brain, it looks like many petals.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:21.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:28.180
That is what is called as Sahastrara because there are 1000 nerves according to sahaja yog.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:34.680
Doctors will fight because they say that there are only 998 because they couldn't count two more.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:41.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:48.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:55.900
Now, these nerves within us, these nerves within us, give us a brain

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.800
which is not being used; We have used very little part of our brain so far.

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:09.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.580
There are so many deeper sides in our brain which we have never used.

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:19.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:26.200
So, if we have to make an experiment, we must ascend and go to our Sahastrara, inside here

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:32.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.460
and you'll be surprised, that when people achieve this breaking of the Sahastrara,

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:43.520
they become one with the All-Pervading Divine ether

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:52.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:57.560
and they develop a new awareness, a new dimension on their Central Nervous System

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.060
that they can feel others, they can feel themselves.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:10.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:16.320
- This is the minimum.
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then, when you raise the Kundalini of others, which you can do,

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.600
you put them in the center and solve all their problems of the sides.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:27.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:40.600
- Many mad people have been cured through sahaja yog - is a fact.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.440
People have dropped their habits, any kind of habits that they had, suddenly just like that overnight.

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:51.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:52.380 --> 01:16:00.380
You can't imagine how people have changed. If I tell you, it cannot be believe because it is impossible for you to believe

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:07.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:11.980
but when you see for yourself this is happening, you are amazed.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:19.980
How this Kundalini rising solves all our problems because we are neither on the right or on the left but we are above ourselves.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:37.380
I'll give you an analogy to understand it because you all are fond of motor-cars - it will be easy to explain.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:45.340
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.680
In every car we have got a accelerator, that is the right side

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:55.460
and the and the break on the left side which stops it - we need both.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:05.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:11.220
Now when we are practicing driving, we, what we do, is to practice the left and the right

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:19.000
both of them and then when we learn it, we learn it. When do we learn - when we learn it.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:25.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:36.240
Alright. So, when we learn driving, what do we know? We know how to use the left and the right.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:43.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:49.440
So, you become a driver; We can say, you become a balanced personality - what we call it, dharmik.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:56.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.740
But supposing, you use only the break, the car will not move

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:06.360
or if you use only the accelerator - you'll know what will happen to you.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:23.160
- But still you are a driver
- [INTERPRETER]
- and the master is sitting at the back.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:30.580
- When you get your realization, you become the master.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.980
Then you start seeing the driver in you and the left in you and the right in you.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.760
and to achieve that we have the central path through which you ascend.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:58.820
This is the path which is established through our ascent

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:04.120
in our previous evolutionary process.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:12.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:18.520
For example, this red thing that you see here - Mooladhara - was Carbon when we were Carbon.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:27.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.060
- Now, the central path represents the Nitrogen,

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.700
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.740
left side the Hydrogen and the right side the Oxygen.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.220
Now, when the Carbon combine with the Nitrogen, it

01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:00.500
it became amino acids and we became alive and ascent started.

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:07.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:16.840
Now, if you consider this as the body of the whole and we are part and parcel of it

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:23.060
then you consider that the evolution has taken place from this to that stage one by one

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:29.000
where all those leaders, who were there, are represented on the centers.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:36.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:48.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:55.000
As human-beings are made in the image of the great Primordial being, you can see here, the center green

01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:00.580
is represents in the, what we call, as Bhavasagara - the Great Ocean.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:07.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:14.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:22.480
and this Great Ocean is the one where the fishes came up through amoeba stage

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:30.400
and then the fishes crossed over and then, gradually,  how all the animal kingdom came up. Like that, all these

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:37.200
deities, that we think of, are the leaders, are the leaders of the centers which they occupy.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:53.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:53.960 --> 01:22:01.000
- So, we can say, that Christ came at this point.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:08.620
He was an Incarnation which was made of, we can say, the,

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:14.600
I get sometimes confused with the English language.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:21.260
uh.. we can say, with the All-Pervading Power, with the Onkara itself.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:36.160
- There was no element of Earth in Him,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:41.400
so He could walk on the water and He could resurrect Himself through this center

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:48.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:51.840
and that's why it is said that He's the gate - through Him you have to pass.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.180
By doing that, it is, the optic chiasma,

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:05.620
in the center of that it is - it is controlling Pitutary and Pineal body.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:10.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:14.340
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.900
Now, when the Kundalini rises and She awakens Christ there, He sucks in

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.340
these two things which are created by left and right side - one is the ego on the,

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.560
on that yellow side and the superego on the left hand side.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:33.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:44.740
So, these ego and superego form this kind of a shell for us and we become like a egg, we can say.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:52.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:57.140
Sometimes they overlap and then we become very hard shell

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:03.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:08.060
and we become, what we call, we develop our I-ness.

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:12.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:18.160
When the Kundalini passes through this Agnya Chakra, then She sucks in, He sucks in

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:24.440
Christ sucks in the left and the right - the conditioning and the karmas and the whole thing goes inside, like that

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:42.020
and over the limbic area, with the fontanel bone area, you find like a small child you develop a soft bone again.

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:48.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.020
- This is your re-birth.
- [INTERPRETER]
- In Sanskrit language

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:59.120
a bird is called as a dwijah - means born twice

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:05.060
and a brahmin, the one who knows the Brahma - the All-Pervading Power, is also called as dwijaha.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:23.780
Brahmins, means the one who has known the Brahma - the one who's a realized soul - but nowadays we have all kinds of Brahmins in India.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Mostly they are cooks

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:41.340
- [INTERPRETER]
- or they sit in the temple and sell ganja on things like that.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.560
- [INTERPRETER]
- Horrid!

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.880
Alright, so now, when, when the Kundalini sucks in and this opens out,

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:56.920
you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area on top of your head

01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:04.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.100
because on top of your head is the place of the

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.520
God Almighty, as we call it, or you call Him Sadashiva or whatever name it may be

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:22.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:28.620
and His power is the Primordial Mother, Adishakti - the Holy Ghost

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:35.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:40.540
- and Onkara is the Son 
- [INTERPRETER]
- is Their Power.

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:47.620
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, it is impossible to understand that you have a Father, Who is a God

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:55.140
you have a God as a Son and no Mother - missing - Holy Ghost, how can you have that?

01:26:55.740 --> 01:27:03.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:08.740
Have you seen such a situation? A father giving birth to a son - I have not seen so far.

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:13.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:20.520
- So there has to be a Mother, the female.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:25.940
That's the Primordial Mother and She's represented within us as Kundalini

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.680
and God Almighty represented within us as the Spirit in our heart.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:39.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:46.320
This knowledge is very vast. You have to enter into the ocean of this knowledge and you'll become that.

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:54.300
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:54.540 --> 01:28:01.560
- You become the knowledge,
- [INTERPRETER]
- you become the joy,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:09.240
- you become the attention - 
- [INTERPRETER]
- that you have to become.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:15.200
- That's what you are - you are fantastic.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:22.040
Only thing, this has to be connected to the mains and the same way, you have to be connected to the mains - that's all; You're all ready for it.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:25.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:32.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:37.400
So, do not have any guilt about it. Know that you're human-beings, specially created.

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:44.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.620
Only thing you have to enter into the Kingdom of God - that's all -

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:54.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:00.640
and your Mother Kundalini, your individual Mother Kundalini is just waiting there to take you down.

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:04.340
- [INTERPRETER]
- to take you up, I should say.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:08.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:19.080
After all, He is God Almighty Who's your Father - He's a Divine Father

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.960
and how can He ask you to suffer?

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:32.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:39.720
He's the most loving Father, He's love personified - how can He make you suffer?

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:46.280
- [INTERPRETER]
- We suffer out of our ignorance - sorry.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:59.560
When the light comes in, you will see how gracious, kind and benevolent He is.

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:06.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:13.680
- Whether you believe in Him or not, He is.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:21.060
- You have to just enter into His Kingdom to see.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:25.600
So, there is no need to deny Him or accept Him but see for yourself.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.220
- May God bless you!
- [INTERPRETER]

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:49.140
Now, I would request, like yesterday some people were

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:54.180
not wanting to have Self-realization, I would request them that they should leave us in peace.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:31:01.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:05.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:12.300
It will hardly take 10-15 minutes for you to get realization but please don't disturb us.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.640
If you want to go, you can go now and don't disturb others.

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:21.380
Better be a kind and civil to people who want to have their realization.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:29.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:33.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:40.800
The experience is very simple and you can really feel it, you don't have to do anything about it.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:49.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:09.640
Sahaja yogis should not disturb. If you're sahaja yogis, you be seated - doesn't matter. You need not get up and walk off

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.800
because no use disturbing people - it's not proper also.

01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:22.020
- Let the sahaja yogis be seated wherever they are
- [INTERPRETER]

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.500
because these are new people and they easily, they get easily disturbed.

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.820
- So, one must keep the silence, please.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:47.960
I had asked you to give Me questions and no questions have come through

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:54.560
but even now, if you have some questions, you may pass them over to our center and I would like to answer them.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:01.180
After this realization I have to make a very great respect,

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:09.460
respectful request to you, that you must have respect for your realization.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:16.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:22.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:28.160
You have to be profound and deep to understand everything but

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:32.960
it gives you depth, suddenly you become deeper personality, immediately.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:40.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.700
Nothing is wanted out of you. If you are a human-being, you'll get your realization.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:52.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.820
Maybe, some may not get today because they might be

01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:01.980
not yet tuned or maybe but doesn't matter, you will always get it.

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:10.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:20.440
Now, as I've told you, you have to have your shoes taken out because we have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:28.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.660
I think, you send him away - would be better - go off to sleep.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:59.720
That's better. Take him away because he will go off to sleep in no time - must be tired.

01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:09.060
All the children can go away now. Let it be. They are all realized souls. They should not be bothered much.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:13.380
They want to sit they can sit down but it's time for them - it's about 90'clock.

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:24.680
Alright, so now, is very simple that I will tell you beforehand what is to be done -

01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:32.520
is to put left hand towards Me because is the desire that you have and the right hand you should use for action.

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:40.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:45.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:51.220
I will show you only and you can see for yourself also. First your heart you have to touch

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:58.700
- [INTERPRETER]
- where resides the Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:05.860
Then everything works on the left hand side. You have to put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.340
where there is the center of your mastery - is the Nabhi chakra.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:17.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:21.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.980
Then, you have to take your right hand and push it into the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:34.320
where is the center of Swadhishtana is, through which we work out the laws of the Divine.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:44.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:50.620
Then you have to raise your right hand again. At this point the Kundalini starts moving

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:55.320
so you have to raise your hand again on the chakra

01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.080
which is the Nabhi chakra on the left hand side on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:07.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:20.100
- Now, again you have to bring your hand on to the heart chakra.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:26.920
Now, here is the left Vishudhhi, which is caught up when we feel guilty - that's a very bad state.

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:32.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.060
Put the hand across like this - not from the back, it's very bad. I tell you, it's the worst chakra today.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:46.560
- [INTERPRETER]
- Yesterday... not to feel guilty at all. I request you not to feel guilty, not to feel guilty - please.

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:53.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:59.000
- Be pleasantly placed towards you.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:03.200
You are the temple of God. Believe Me, you are the temple of God

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:14.520
- and turn your head to the right and hold it tight like that.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.400
Now, then you have to take your right hand put it on your forehead. Press it on both the sides.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:27.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:33.520
Now, you have to take your right hand. Put it back on your

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:39.600
back Agnya, which is on the, we can say, on the optic lobe and push back your head like this.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:47.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:52.380
- Now, you have to stretch your hand fully.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:59.340
Stretch fully. Now, put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area.

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.580
Press it very hard and move it seven times.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.620
- [INTERPRETER]
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.620
But before we start today, we better give us ourselves a balance a little bit.

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:29.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:34.560
- Please put your left hand towards Me, like this for ...
- [INTERPRETER]

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:41.840
Now, what you have to do, your right side is too much working, so, we have to give a balance to ourselves.

01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:47.380
You put your right hand just like this and take it up on your head

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:51.220
and put it on the side like that and throw it away.

01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:59.380
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.920
- We'll do it three times to begin with. Let us start.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:10.640
On top of your head, on top of your head, nicely - push it down. Again,

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.980
throw it down. Again, take it on top of of your head, nicely.

01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:20.620
Throw it down. Again

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.960
- and throw it down. Now, it's a balance.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:37.360
Now, let us start with the left hand towards Me, like this - this is the desire, this is the action and close your eyes now.

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:43.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:50.820
Please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Slowly, like that, not at a stretch - just like this, just like this. It's alright - anyway.

01:40:53.060 --> 01:41:00.920
You will stretch your hand too much, madam. Just put it like... very relaxed. You'll be tired - yes, just in a comfortable way.

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:08.380
- Alright, yeah. Now, put your right hand on your heart, please.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:14.660
You may take out your spectacles because you have to keep your eyes shut all the time and it helps the eyesight also.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:22.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:27.260
Alright, now, close your eyes, please. Don't open them till I tell you.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:32.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:39.140
Now, now on the heart you put your right hand and you have to say

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.040
or you have to ask a question, a very fundamental question.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
You can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother - whatever suits you -

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:55.260
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask the question three times.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:11.040
- Three times, please.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.220
This fundamental question is followed by another because if you are the Spirit, you are your master too.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:32.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.840
Now, so, you put your right hand now on the upper portion

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.660
of your abdomen, without opening your eyes, on the left hand side.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:51.800
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:57.960
Now here, you have to ask the second question.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.020
This is the center of mastery, so you have to ask a question, another question,

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.140
"Mother, am I my own master?" ask this question three times.

part of your abdomen on the left hand side and here is the center of true knowledge, of Pure Knowledge.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:54.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:54.740 --> 01:44:00.700
Here, we cannot force you to ask this question

01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:05.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:12.420
so, you have to ask yourself in all your freedom, which I respect.

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:17.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:22.680
[Let it be, doesn't matter. Leave her alone.]

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:28.540
You have to ask the question, here, by saying

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:37.240
or you have to ask or you have to ask  for My help by saying, "Mother, may I have the Pure Knowledge."

- Please don't open your eyes, please don't open your eyes.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:42.920
Alright, now here, as the Kundalini has started moving,

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:50.240
you have to open this chakra, by saying with full confidence

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:58.060
because this is the master's chakra, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:05.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:36.120
Ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.500
Now, with full confidence, again you put your right hand on your heart,

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:04.280
-  [INTERPRETER]
- on your heart.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:11.880
Here now, with full confidence, you have to say again,

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:16.640
"Mother, I am my own

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:21.540
Spirit," or you can say, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:29.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:36.880
- Please say it twelve times,
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:45.220
- with full confidence - this is the greatest Truth.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.320
- Twelve times
- [INTERPRETER]

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:07.900

between you neck and your shoulder and press it hard and move your neck to the right side.

[INTERPRETER]

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:31.180
Now here, with full confidence, again you have to say,

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.720
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:41.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:48.940
Even after saying that, you want to feel guilty, you better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:53.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:06.740
- You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.000
- Alright, that's good!
- [INTERPRETER]

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.240
Now, raise your right hand and put it to your forehead across.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:28.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.320
- Now here you press it on both the sides
- [INTERPRETER]

01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:37.720
and here you have to say,

01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:45.120
from your heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:01.580
Whether you forgive or not forgive, it's a myth but if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:06.780
So, just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone," from your heart.

01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:12.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:24.380
Now, God or Divine is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:32.900
- [INTERPRETER]
- so, don't feel guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:39.320
and please put your right hand now, on the back side of your head and hold it tight and push back your head.

01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:43.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:53.460
Now here again, without feeling guilty, you just say for your own satisfaction,

01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:58.940
"O Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me." - for your own satisfaction.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:04.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:10.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:24.520
- Now, take out your hand and stretch it please.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:30.180
Stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of your head and press it hard.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.300
Now here, you have to move it seven times and you have to say -

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:43.640
because I cannot force you - again here your freedom is respected. You have to say, "Mother, please give me my realization."

01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:51.340
"Mother, please, may I have my realization." Press it hard, press it hard the center part; Stretch your fingers.

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:58.580
- [INTERPRETER]
- On your head, on your head
- [INTERPRETER]

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:15.320
