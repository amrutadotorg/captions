00:00.500 --> 00:07.190
you’re too free to do what you like, absolutely
free, there’s no binding force except that

00:07.190 --> 00:12.080
you feel the love of your Mother.

00:12.080 --> 00:16.560
Supposing you are not feeling the vibrations
in your hand, there’s no way of binding

00:16.560 --> 00:18.630
you down to Sahaja Yog, nothing.

00:18.630 --> 00:24.070
We just advise “Go ahead, it will work out,
let it work out.”

00:24.070 --> 00:28.349
There is no fees, there’s no registration,
there’s no compulsion, nothing.

00:28.349 --> 00:30.320
It’s your own free will.

00:30.320 --> 00:36.540
If you want to stick on you can stick on,
if you want to go away you can go away.

00:36.540 --> 00:39.940
There’s no force on you of any kind.

00:39.940 --> 00:45.260
There’s no registration of your names with
some fees or anything, I mean you are not

00:45.260 --> 00:48.010
bound to pay anything.

00:48.010 --> 00:51.001
If you paid something then you feel, “All
right I’ve paid for it, so go through it

00:51.001 --> 00:52.620
what ever it is, good or bad..

00:52.620 --> 00:56.030
Supposing you go to see a play and it’s
a horrid play but still you say, “All right

00:56.030 --> 01:01.320
I’ve paid for it so let me go through it.”

01:01.320 --> 01:04.330
But that you cannot do with Sahaja Yog because
you’ve not paid.

01:04.330 --> 01:09.460
There’s nobody will force you down, nobody
will go on telephoning to you, “Come along,

01:09.460 --> 01:11.700
please come along,” and all that.

01:11.700 --> 01:15.070
So the attitude has to be changed, it is I
who has to gain.

01:15.070 --> 01:18.700
Say there’s a beautiful spot somewhere.

01:18.700 --> 01:24.070
Now that beautiful spot doesn’t send an
invitation card to anyone, everybody goes

01:24.070 --> 01:25.070
there.

01:25.070 --> 01:28.950
But if you have not yet discovered the beauty
of Sahaja Yog in that way and have not enjoyed

01:28.950 --> 01:33.030
it fully, you’ll have to go again and again
and see for yourself.

01:33.030 --> 01:40.320
It is a deliberation on your side not on the
side of the Sahaja Yogis or Sahaja Yoga.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.450
It’s not going to fall at your feet.

01:43.450 --> 01:49.649
That please come to Sahaja Yoga, please donate
something, nothing of the kind.

01:49.649 --> 01:55.759
If you come you are welcome, if you don’t
come, welcome.

01:55.759 --> 02:00.880
On the contrary, you will be surprised there’s
more rejection than acceptance in Sahaja Yog.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.500
That’s also innately built.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.800
I’ve seen some people who are very insincere
type they just go out from Sahaja Yoga like

02:06.800 --> 02:09.810
a tangent.

02:09.810 --> 02:14.200
There was a gentleman who was very troublesome
to us in Bombay and we didn’t know what

02:14.200 --> 02:24.400
to do with him and he just got transferred
from there and we got rid of him.

02:24.400 --> 02:31.430
So you just go out of Sahaja Yoga like a tangent
and we are saved from the botheration.

02:31.430 --> 02:36.430
Because you must understand, if you have problems,
if you are not all right it’s a problem

02:36.430 --> 02:38.340
for Sahaja Yogis to correct you.

02:38.340 --> 02:44.599
It’s just the other way round, if you understand
this, then you will understand the thing,

02:44.599 --> 02:45.599
what works out.

02:45.599 --> 02:50.430
For example if I have to cure somebody it’s
a problem for Me and not the problem for the

02:50.430 --> 02:52.700
person who’s sick.

02:52.700 --> 03:01.430
Now if the tree has to grow is the problem
for the gardener not for the tree.

03:01.430 --> 03:08.890
So the tree must see to it that it co-operates
with the gardener and gets itself developed.

03:08.890 --> 03:15.450
If this understanding is developed, that it
is I who has to gain, it is I who has to go

03:15.450 --> 03:22.860
forward, Mother has not to gain from me anything,
She wants me to have all my powers manifested.

03:22.860 --> 03:30.750
She wants me to grow through it, if this attitude
is developed then you’ll work hard to grow

03:30.750 --> 03:33.239
and you’ll work it out.

03:33.239 --> 03:38.390
But on the contrary you see at the slightest
protest if you ego stands up and says, “Why,

03:38.390 --> 03:42.770
why should I do this?”

03:42.770 --> 03:48.159
To overcome this hurdle you see, we have to
build up certain stages.

03:48.159 --> 03:52.739
That’s what Modi was telling Me.

03:52.739 --> 03:56.959
That you first become thoughtlessly aware,
see that silence is established.

03:56.959 --> 04:04.310
There are certain things that you do much
later, everybody is not allowed in there,

04:04.310 --> 04:11.040
because truth can be only born by people who
are strong enough to bear it.

04:11.040 --> 04:20.680
That’s why I’m not going to tell you who
am I, till you reach a certain stage, because

04:20.680 --> 04:22.070
you cannot bear the light.

04:22.070 --> 04:24.440
That’s what happened with Christ.

04:24.440 --> 04:32.300
They crucified Him because they could not
bear Him.

04:32.300 --> 04:36.000
Human beings are like that, they can’t even
bear an incarnation of love.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.040
They can’t even bear love, it’s too much
for them.

04:40.040 --> 04:46.070
Even if you give them too much love they get
upset, they get disturbed, they just can’t

04:46.070 --> 04:47.070
bear it.

04:47.070 --> 04:51.910
So you have to build up yourself to come to
a certain stage of understanding of Sahaja

04:51.910 --> 04:52.910
Yoga.

04:52.910 --> 04:55.320
It’s a state, which you achieve.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.780
It’s a state.

04:56.780 --> 04:59.110
You are not to be certified by anyone on them.

04:59.110 --> 05:06.699
But it’s a state where you will start giving
realization to others and the whole way you’ll

05:06.699 --> 05:11.199
be talking you will be in a very different
manner as if you are completely detached.

05:11.199 --> 05:15.060
You’ll say “It is going, it is coming.”

05:15.060 --> 05:16.060
It happens.

05:16.060 --> 05:21.080
You will not say my mother must get, my father
must get, you will never say like that.

05:21.080 --> 05:29.530
Because you’ll understand that the problem
of Sahaja Yoga is that it cannot give to anyone.

05:29.530 --> 05:36.560
Like the sunshine can shine it is for the
trees to expose themselves to the sunshine

05:36.560 --> 05:39.630
and get the advantage of it.

05:39.630 --> 05:45.990
The sunshine is not going to run after you
all over to see that you get it.

05:45.990 --> 05:54.810
This is the point here, it will shine the
whole day and you take it.

05:54.810 --> 05:59.470
But it’s not that it will run after you
all the time requesting you, “Oh please

05:59.470 --> 06:07.330
get me, oh please get me, have it, have it,”
like that.

06:07.330 --> 06:14.081
And this is what one has to understand very
clearly, that it is you who has to ask for

06:14.081 --> 06:19.169
it, and not anybody is going to force on you
anything.

06:19.169 --> 06:25.740
On the contrary if anybody tries to say something
more your ego gets like that.

06:25.740 --> 06:28.840
So try to be careful.
