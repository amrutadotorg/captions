WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:06.250
So now, we all have arrived,
it’s all right.

00:06.275 --> 00:08.790
Now, this place has been chosen because
they said that

00:08.815 --> 00:11.393
there are lots of horrible people
the other way round.

00:11.418 --> 00:15.895
Still, we are having their problems.
All right.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.668
You see, you must know these are
modern times,

00:18.693 --> 00:22.543
and modern times have lots
of complications.

00:22.568 --> 00:25.492
Has everyone arrived?

00:26.565 --> 00:29.251
I will first speak in English, then
in Marathi.

00:29.276 --> 00:34.526
As these people can’t understand anything
otherwise, and that won’t be proper.

00:34.551 --> 00:37.261
In these modern times,

00:37.286 --> 00:43.197
a place which is supposed to be a holy
place becomes the most unholy place.

00:44.190 --> 00:47.853
It’s such a topsy-turvy condition these
days.

00:47.878 --> 00:53.125
And when we are trying to establish
something very fundamental,

00:53.150 --> 00:58.332
it’s like a little seedling that has
to come out of the stones, you see.

00:58.357 --> 01:03.148
It has to fight lots of things, so we have
to keep our brains intact

01:03.173 --> 01:08.762
and be sensible about everything, and try
to see what we can achieve

01:08.787 --> 01:13.769
through our patience and understanding
- is very important.

01:13.794 --> 01:19.000
Today, I think, is a very great day
for all of us

01:19.025 --> 01:28.246
because this place is the place of Virat,
of Shri Vitthala.

01:28.271 --> 01:33.985
Is the place where Shri Vitthala appeared

01:34.858 --> 01:39.699
to a devoted son

01:39.724 --> 01:47.738
and when he asked Him that, "You better
stand on a brick," He stood there.

01:48.813 --> 01:57.279
And they say that He stood there waiting.

01:57.304 --> 02:03.614
Some people say that the statue
that we see

02:03.639 --> 02:08.974
came out of the Mother Earth on this sand

02:09.841 --> 02:16.672
and that's what Pundarikaksh carried
saying that,

02:16.697 --> 02:24.518
"These are the ones who came to see my,
see me and my parents;

02:24.543 --> 02:33.215
and I was busy with them, so they are
standing on the same brick which I threw."

02:35.779 --> 02:43.917
Now the whole story has to be taken

02:43.942 --> 02:52.310
in a very sensible way, with the
common-sense in it.

02:52.335 --> 03:00.553
That God Himself is capable of all kinds
of miracles.

03:02.502 --> 03:09.350
We, who are created by God, are doing
some things which look miraculous.

03:09.375 --> 03:15.429
Say, if you take about hundred-year-old
situation of this world,

03:15.454 --> 03:21.432
we can say that today we are seeing many
things which could be miraculous.

03:21.457 --> 03:25.669
Hundred years back, nobody could
have thought  that we could have

03:25.694 --> 03:32.694
all these arrangements done here in such
a far-fetched places.

03:32.719 --> 03:39.667
But all these miracles come from
the power of God.

03:39.692 --> 03:44.142
So we are the creator

03:44.845 --> 03:50.797
of that wee bit, very wee bit of that
miracle.

03:51.610 --> 03:58.343
So all the miracles of God cannot be
explained and should not be explained.

03:58.368 --> 04:05.432
They are beyond our minds, and, to make
people feel the presence of God,

04:05.457 --> 04:10.506
God can do anything. He can move
into all the three dimensions

04:10.531 --> 04:14.698
and also in the fourth dimension. He can
do whatever He feels like.

04:14.723 --> 04:19.104
That's what you have seen now in your

04:20.419 --> 04:25.501
every day-to-day life, how many miracles
take place to all of you,

04:25.526 --> 04:29.547
and you can't understand how it works out.

04:29.572 --> 04:34.042
Even it works out on things which are
not living,

04:34.067 --> 04:37.943
and people are quite amazed how these
things happen.

04:37.968 --> 04:44.224
So we have to believe, now, after seeing
all this ourselves,

04:44.249 --> 04:47.255
that He is God,

04:48.177 --> 04:51.670
and He can do anything that He feels like.

04:51.695 --> 04:55.197
And we are nothing. We are nothing.

04:55.222 --> 05:00.290
There should be no rationality about it
- of understanding God's miracles.

05:00.315 --> 05:06.046
"How can it be? How could it be?"
You can't explain.

05:07.407 --> 05:13.910
Only when you achieve that state of mind
where

05:15.763 --> 05:21.849
you believe, through your experiences,

05:21.874 --> 05:30.201
that God is all-powerful.

05:34.221 --> 05:38.490
It's very difficult. This concept is
very difficult

05:38.515 --> 05:43.188
because we are limited people, we have
limited powers,

05:43.213 --> 05:46.430
we cannot understand how God could be
all-powerful

05:46.455 --> 05:51.743
because we, we haven't got the capacity.

05:52.668 --> 05:56.624
So this God

05:57.808 --> 06:04.296
who is our Creator, who is our Preserver,

06:04.321 --> 06:10.079
the One who desired that we should exist,
who is our existence itself,

06:10.104 --> 06:15.776
is an all-powerful God, all-powerful.

06:18.173 --> 06:21.238
He can do whatever He likes with you.

06:21.263 --> 06:25.928
He can create another world, He can
destroy this world.

06:25.953 --> 06:30.016
It's only if He has to desire.

06:31.916 --> 06:38.240
My idea of coming to Pandharpur
for Shiva Puja was this:

06:38.265 --> 06:41.893
that Shiva represents the Spirit,

06:44.190 --> 06:53.834
and the Spirit is residing in all of you
in your hearts.

06:58.221 --> 07:03.336
The seat of Sadashiva is on top
of your head

07:05.405 --> 07:09.461
but is reflected in your heart.

07:11.674 --> 07:17.038
Now, your brain is the Vitthala.

07:20.176 --> 07:23.589
So to bring Spirit to your brain

07:23.614 --> 07:31.129
means enlightenment of your brain.

07:33.475 --> 07:38.508
Enlightenment of your brain means

07:39.424 --> 07:45.933
the limited capacity of your brain
has to become unlimited,

07:46.583 --> 07:54.065
in its capacity to realize God.

07:54.090 --> 07:58.264
I will not use the word 'understand'
- but 'to realize God' -

07:58.289 --> 08:01.473
how powerful He is,

08:01.498 --> 08:06.097
how miraculous He is, how great He is.

08:08.461 --> 08:14.920
The another is that the brain of man

08:15.822 --> 08:20.512
can create - of course, out of the dead;

08:21.845 --> 08:29.247
but when the Spirit comes into brain,

08:31.704 --> 08:35.288
then you create living things,

08:35.313 --> 08:40.665
living work of Kundalini.

08:42.175 --> 08:46.841
Even the dead start behaving like living

08:46.866 --> 08:53.470
because you touch the Spirit in the dead.

08:54.173 --> 08:59.175
Like the nucleus

09:00.334 --> 09:07.188
inside every atom or a molecule

09:07.927 --> 09:12.030
has the Spirit of that molecule.

09:12.496 --> 09:15.936
And if you become your Spirit...

09:15.961 --> 09:20.887
We can say the brain of

09:23.149 --> 09:26.569
a molecule or an atom

09:26.594 --> 09:30.105
is like the nucleus, body of the nucleus.

09:30.130 --> 09:33.270
But the one that controls the nucleus
is the Spirit

09:33.295 --> 09:36.230
that resides within the nucleus.

09:36.255 --> 09:41.862
So now you have got the attention,
or the body

09:44.092 --> 09:49.545
- the whole body of the atom - then
the nucleus,

09:49.570 --> 09:52.728
and inside the nucleus is the Spirit.

09:52.753 --> 09:58.266
In the same way - we have this body,
the attention of the body.

09:59.812 --> 10:06.778
And then we have the...

10:08.698 --> 10:13.904
we have the nucleus

10:17.584 --> 10:19.994
- is the brain.

10:22.205 --> 10:26.810
And the Spirit is in the heart.

10:26.835 --> 10:34.997
So the brain is controlled through
the Spirit.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.009
How?

10:38.034 --> 10:43.716
That around the heart

10:44.629 --> 10:48.016
there are seven auras

10:51.247 --> 10:55.402
which can be multiplied into any number,

10:55.427 --> 10:59.043
seven raised to power sixteen hundred,

11:00.132 --> 11:06.507
which are the ones

11:08.623 --> 11:15.622
which watch the seven chakras,

11:15.647 --> 11:19.134
raised to power sixteen hundred -

11:19.694 --> 11:22.683
sixteen thousand, sorry.

11:24.978 --> 11:33.453
Now this Spirit is watching through
this aura;

11:33.830 --> 11:40.129
watching - I am again saying “watching”
- through this aura.

11:40.154 --> 11:43.050
Can you sit down?

11:48.407 --> 11:50.764
Can you sit down? I think, would be
better.

11:50.789 --> 11:56.161
There is no need to bother, once you
have put it up.

11:58.961 --> 12:03.548
This aura is watching

12:04.987 --> 12:11.177
the behaviour of your seven centres
in your brain.

12:11.494 --> 12:16.904
Is also watching all the nerves
that are working

12:16.929 --> 12:20.468
in the brain - “watching”, again.

12:20.944 --> 12:25.133
But when you bring the Spirit

12:29.009 --> 12:32.201
into your brain,

12:34.059 --> 12:37.884
then you go two steps ahead,

12:40.316 --> 12:45.180
because when your Kundalini rises,

12:46.623 --> 12:54.875
She touches the Sadashiva
and Sadashiva informs the Spirit.

12:54.900 --> 12:59.752
Informs in the sense - reflects
in the Spirit.

13:00.159 --> 13:07.658
So that's the first state where
the watching auras

13:08.377 --> 13:14.062
start communicating

13:15.410 --> 13:22.517
through your different chakras
in the brain

13:22.542 --> 13:25.841
and integrating it.

13:26.913 --> 13:31.383
But when you bring your Spirit
to your brain

13:31.859 --> 13:35.032
- this is the second state -

13:37.753 --> 13:43.002
then you really become self-realized,
in the full way,

13:43.027 --> 13:49.278
in the full way because then your Self,
that is the Spirit,

13:49.303 --> 13:53.663
becomes your brain.

13:54.491 --> 13:58.184
Action is very dynamic,

13:58.209 --> 14:05.116
it opens then the fifth dimension
in the human being.

14:06.705 --> 14:12.538
First, when you become realized,
collectively conscious,

14:12.563 --> 14:19.931
and start raising the Kundalini, you are
in, you cross the fourth dimension.

14:19.956 --> 14:25.371
But when your Spirit comes into
your brain,

14:25.918 --> 14:32.442
then you become the fifth dimension
- means, you become the doer.

14:36.871 --> 14:41.073
Our brain, now, for example, says,
"All right, lift this thing up."

14:41.098 --> 14:47.037
So you touch it with your hand,
you lift it up. You are the doer.

14:47.062 --> 14:53.916
But when the brain becomes the Spirit,
the Spirit is the doer,

14:55.418 --> 14:59.742
and when Spirit is the doer,

15:01.532 --> 15:05.186
then you become

15:06.232 --> 15:12.324
a complete Shiva - self-realized.

15:13.222 --> 15:19.231
In that state, if you get angry,

15:20.722 --> 15:23.314
you are not attached.

15:24.675 --> 15:29.440
You are not an attached person to anything
whatsoever.

15:30.499 --> 15:33.389
If you possess anything, you are
not attached.

15:33.414 --> 15:37.730
You cannot attach because Spirit
is detachment,

15:37.755 --> 15:40.395
is complete detachment.

15:40.705 --> 15:46.947
You don't bother about any attachments
whatsoever.

15:46.972 --> 15:51.091
Even for a second, you are not attached.

15:55.285 --> 16:01.801
Now, I would say, to understand
the detachment of Spirit,

16:01.826 --> 16:06.906
we should study ourselves very well,
clearly:

16:07.311 --> 16:10.216
“How are we attached?”.

16:10.241 --> 16:15.802
We are attached, firstly, by our brain,

16:15.827 --> 16:22.796
mostly by our brain because all our
conditionings are in our brain,

16:22.821 --> 16:27.779
and all our ego is also in our brain.

16:31.329 --> 16:38.217
So all emotional attachments are
through our brain,

16:38.691 --> 16:44.736
and all our egoistical attachments, also,
are through our brain.

16:46.500 --> 16:51.229
That's why it is said that after
Realization one must try to practice

16:51.254 --> 16:57.163
the Shiva Tattwa by practicing detachment.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.277
Please, give Me the shawl.

17:00.302 --> 17:03.960
It’s so cold because of Shri Shiva.

17:03.985 --> 17:09.422
Now how do you practice this detachment?

17:12.351 --> 17:16.056
All of you can understand English
a little bit, isn’t it?

17:16.081 --> 17:19.319
Because we get attached to something,
of course, through our brain,

17:19.344 --> 17:22.234
but through our attention.

17:22.259 --> 17:29.322
So we try to do what we call
Chitta Nirodh,

17:29.347 --> 17:33.252
is to control your attention: where
is it going?

17:33.277 --> 17:38.336
In the practice of Sahaja Yoga, if you
have to rise higher,

17:38.361 --> 17:43.060
you have to improve your own instrument,
and not the instrument of others.

17:43.085 --> 17:47.534
This is one thing one should know,
for definite.

17:48.141 --> 17:53.452
Now, you just watch your attention,
where is it going. Watch yourself.

17:53.477 --> 17:58.281
As soon as you’ll start watching yourself,
your attention, you’ll become

17:58.306 --> 18:01.873
more identified with your Spirit. Because
if you have to watch your attention,

18:01.898 --> 18:06.294
you have to be your Spirit, otherwise
how will you watch it?

18:06.583 --> 18:10.531
So, now, see where is your attention
going.

18:11.988 --> 18:19.954
First, the attachment is, in all gross
ways, to your body.

18:21.353 --> 18:27.758
So we see Shiva – He has no attachment
to His body.

18:29.487 --> 18:32.244
He sleeps anywhere.

18:33.471 --> 18:38.926
He goes to the cemeteries and He sleeps
there because He’s not attached.

18:38.951 --> 18:43.098
He can never be caught up by any bhoots
or anything, nothing of the kind.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.046
See, He is detached.

18:53.516 --> 19:02.767
The detachment is to be watched and seen
through your own attachments.

19:05.413 --> 19:08.809
Now, because you are realized souls,

19:08.834 --> 19:12.064
not yet the Spirit, has not come into
your brain, of course,

19:12.089 --> 19:16.440
but still you are realized souls. So what
you can do

19:16.465 --> 19:22.049
is at least to watch your attention,
you can do that.

19:24.012 --> 19:29.413
You can watch your attention very clearly

19:30.858 --> 19:35.901
by seeing where your attention is going.

19:38.051 --> 19:42.867
And then, controlling your attention,
also, you can do.

19:42.892 --> 19:45.435
Very simple:

19:48.036 --> 19:51.421
to control your attention

19:51.690 --> 19:58.116
you have to just remove your attention
from this to that.

19:58.141 --> 20:01.879
Try to change your priorities.

20:02.633 --> 20:07.875
All this has to be done now, after
Realization - a complete detachment.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.809
So the body demands comfort,

20:11.834 --> 20:17.050
try to make body uncomfortable
a little bit. Try.

20:17.075 --> 20:21.483
What you think it to be comfortable,

20:21.508 --> 20:26.051
try to make it little uncomfortable.
That's why people went to Himalayas.

20:26.076 --> 20:30.226
You see, coming to this place itself has
caused us lot of problems.

20:30.251 --> 20:34.069
But going to Himalayas - you can
imagine.

20:35.362 --> 20:38.675
So after Realization, they used to take
their body to Himalayas, "All right,

20:38.715 --> 20:42.821
go through all this. Let's see how
you act."

20:43.226 --> 20:47.788
So what you call the penance side
starts now in a way.

20:47.813 --> 20:52.053
it's a penance which you can do very easily
because now you are realized souls.

20:52.078 --> 20:57.923
With enjoyment, little, try to make
this body...

21:00.189 --> 21:04.914
For Shiva, it doesn't matter whether
He is in a cemetery

21:04.939 --> 21:11.217
or in His own Kailasha or anywhere.

21:15.501 --> 21:19.408
Where is your attention is, you see.

21:20.881 --> 21:29.024
That your human attention is hopelessly
bad. Very entangled nonsense it is.

21:30.312 --> 21:35.636
"We did this because of this." There is
an explanation.

21:35.661 --> 21:40.073
Or others have to give an explanation.
No explanation is needed

21:40.098 --> 21:45.584
to be given, or to be accepted, or to be
asked for. No explanation.

21:45.609 --> 21:50.936
To exist without explanation is the best
way.

21:53.242 --> 22:00.418
In a simple Hindi language, "Jaise rakhahu
taise hi rahu".

22:00.443 --> 22:04.971
"Whichever way you keep me I'll remain
in that state,

22:04.996 --> 22:09.050
and I’ll enjoy."

22:09.075 --> 22:13.405
Further in this poem, Kabira says,

22:13.430 --> 22:16.433
"If you make me go on an elephant”

22:16.458 --> 22:24.028
- means the royal conveyance - “I'll go.
If you make me walk, I'll walk."

22:24.614 --> 22:29.171
"Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu".
So no reaction on that point,

22:29.196 --> 22:34.479
no reaction. First no explanation,
no reaction.

22:39.121 --> 22:44.791
Now, second is about food.

22:45.338 --> 22:50.347
But that’s the first seeking human
beings had as animals.

22:50.902 --> 22:54.039
No attention on food.

22:56.456 --> 23:00.293
Whether you have salt or not, whether
you have this or that

23:00.318 --> 23:03.325
- no attention on food.

23:06.998 --> 23:11.458
Actually, you should not remember
what you ate this morning.

23:11.483 --> 23:16.062
But we think as to what we are going
to eat tomorrow.

23:17.307 --> 23:24.276
We consume food not for running this body
but for sort of a

23:24.301 --> 23:31.175
more satisfaction of tongue pleasures.

23:31.200 --> 23:37.600
Once you start understanding that pleasure
is a sign of gross attention

23:39.591 --> 23:44.185
- any kind of pleasure is a very

23:45.304 --> 23:52.664
gross sensationalization - sensations.
Very gross it is.

23:53.513 --> 23:56.308
But when I say, "No pleasures," means,
doesn't mean that you should become

23:56.333 --> 24:02.268
serious people and people of, sort of,

24:02.708 --> 24:06.658
as if somebody is dead in your family!

24:07.618 --> 24:13.832
But you should be like Shiva.
So detached.

24:13.857 --> 24:18.232
He came on a bull, which was running
very fast, to get married.

24:18.257 --> 24:21.468
He was sitting on a bull with His two feet
like this, you see,

24:21.493 --> 24:25.188
and the bull is running fast and He is
holding the bull.

24:25.213 --> 24:28.039
The feet like this!

24:32.597 --> 24:35.723
And He’s coming for His wedding.

24:35.748 --> 24:39.665
And with Him are coming people
with one eye,

24:39.690 --> 24:44.528
without noses, all kinds of funny people
coming with Him.

24:45.012 --> 24:50.146
And His wife feeling quite embarrassed
at the nonsensical

24:50.900 --> 24:54.679
things people are talking about Shiva.

24:57.048 --> 25:00.439
He is not bothered what’s His reputation
would be, this thing.

25:00.464 --> 25:05.903
But that doesn't mean that you become
hippies. You see this is the problem is:

25:05.928 --> 25:10.468
that once you start thinking like that,
you become hippies.

25:10.493 --> 25:16.332
Many people believe that if you try to
behave like Shiva, you become Shiva.

25:16.357 --> 25:22.572
Many believe that way: that if you take
ganja, you become Shiva

25:22.597 --> 25:26.899
because Shiva used to take ganja. Because
He used, He was consuming all that

25:26.924 --> 25:30.606
to finish off from this world.

25:30.631 --> 25:33.015
For Him what does it matter whether
it's a ganja or anything?

25:33.040 --> 25:38.585
Give Him anything, He’ll never get drunk,
no question. He is consuming all that.

25:38.610 --> 25:41.482
Or they think, if they live like Shiva,

25:41.507 --> 25:51.840
the way He was detached about things,
least bothered about His appearances.

25:52.475 --> 25:58.096
What appearance Shiva needs is that,
whatever He appears as His beauty.

25:58.121 --> 26:01.678
He doesn't need anything to be done.

26:05.720 --> 26:14.479
So attachment to anything is ugliness.

26:14.504 --> 26:18.569
Is ugliness, is nonsense.

26:19.599 --> 26:23.705
But you can dress up whatever way
you like,

26:24.653 --> 26:27.571
or even if you are in the most ordinary
dress,

26:27.596 --> 26:31.757
you will look the most magnificent person.

26:32.065 --> 26:36.625
But it's not that if you, if you say that,
"All right, so under these circumstances,

26:36.650 --> 26:42.576
let us go about on a one sheet wrapped
around".

26:43.504 --> 26:46.946
The beauty that has evolved within you
through Spirit,

26:46.971 --> 26:50.768
gives you that power that you can wear
whatever you feel like -

26:50.793 --> 26:56.062
makes no difference to your beauty,
your beauty is there all the time.

26:56.087 --> 26:59.526
But have you achieved that state?

26:59.551 --> 27:07.563
And that state only you achieve when
your Spirit enters into your brain.

27:07.588 --> 27:12.904
With ego-oriented people is more difficult,
and that’s why they cannot enjoy things.

27:12.929 --> 27:17.004
At the slightest pretext, they topple
down.

27:18.373 --> 27:24.322
And Spirit, which is the source of joy,
just doesn't come in,

27:24.347 --> 27:31.964
doesn't show. The joy is beauty.
The joy itself is beauty.

27:34.649 --> 27:39.035
But that is a state one has to achieve.

27:39.060 --> 27:43.559
Attachments come by various methods.

27:44.277 --> 27:50.559
If you go little ahead with it, then you
have attachments of your family,

27:50.584 --> 27:53.659
“What will happen to my child? What will
happen to my husband?

27:53.684 --> 27:59.465
What will happen to my mother, to my
wife?", this, that nonsense.

28:01.858 --> 28:08.728
Who is your father and who is your mother?
Who is your husband and who is your wife?

28:08.753 --> 28:12.576
For Shiva, He doesn't know all these
things.

28:12.601 --> 28:19.387
To Him, He and His Power are inseparable
things.

28:19.691 --> 28:25.181
So He stands as singular personality.

28:25.921 --> 28:33.731
There is no dual... duality. When there is
duality, then only you say, “my wife.”

28:35.847 --> 28:42.253
You go on saying, “my nose, my ears,
my hands,

28:42.880 --> 28:47.546
my, my, my, my.” Go, go, go deep down.

28:47.571 --> 28:52.649
Till you say “my”, there is some duality.

28:56.022 --> 29:02.847
But when I say, "I, the nose", then
there is no duality.

29:02.872 --> 29:08.624
Shiva the Shakti, Shakti the Shiva.
There’s no duality.

29:08.649 --> 29:14.870
But we live throughout on our duality,
and because of that,

29:14.895 --> 29:19.802
there is an attachment. If there is no
duality, what is the attachment, you see?

29:19.827 --> 29:25.796
If you are the light and you are the lamp,
then where is the duality?

29:25.821 --> 29:31.702
If you are the moon and you are the
moonlight, then where is the duality?

29:31.727 --> 29:35.028
If you are the sun and you are
the sunlight,

29:35.053 --> 29:42.437
you are the word and you are the meaning,
then where is the duality?

29:42.462 --> 29:47.447
But when there is this separation,
there is duality,

29:47.472 --> 29:50.645
and because of this separation, you feel
attached.

29:50.670 --> 29:54.957
Because if you are that, how will you
be attached?

29:55.806 --> 29:58.277
Do you see that point?

29:58.302 --> 30:05.749
Because there is a difference and
a distance between you and yours,

30:05.774 --> 30:13.161
that's why you get attached to it.
But it's me, who is the other?

30:14.327 --> 30:18.764
This whole universe is me, who is
he other?

30:18.789 --> 30:21.226
Everything is me, who is the other?

30:21.251 --> 30:26.190
But it's not that, it's a brainwave
or a ego brain wave.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.981
Sit down, sit down. I will ask if I need
something. It’s disturbing others.

30:29.006 --> 30:31.040
Sit down. We are talking about a very
important topic.

30:31.065 --> 30:33.642
I won’t need anything at this moment.

30:33.667 --> 30:37.279
Even if I sit for nine hours I won’t
need anything.

30:37.304 --> 30:42.766
Please sit without worrying. You should
not disturb. Sit, please.

30:44.453 --> 30:47.589
So who is the other?

30:48.974 --> 30:51.292
Nobody!

30:51.605 --> 30:57.922
That's only possible when your Spirit
comes into your brain,

30:57.947 --> 31:05.278
and you become part and parcel of Virat
Itself. Virat is the brain, as I told you.

31:11.949 --> 31:16.048
Then everything that you do - when you
show your temper,

31:16.073 --> 31:19.691
when you show your affection, when you
show your compassion, anything -

31:19.716 --> 31:25.669
is the Spirit that is expressing, because
brain has lost its identity.

31:25.694 --> 31:32.516
The so-called limited brain, it has
become the unlimited Spirit.

31:33.951 --> 31:37.027
I do not know,

31:39.025 --> 31:46.971
I really do not know, how to give
an analogy to a thing like that.

31:47.937 --> 31:52.124
But what we can do is to understand it,

31:52.149 --> 32:04.724
that if a colour is dropped in the ocean,

32:12.928 --> 32:17.582
the ocean becomes colourful -

32:20.821 --> 32:23.861
is not possible.

32:28.352 --> 32:30.590
But -

32:38.109 --> 32:46.514
try to understand, if a little colour,
limited colour, is dropped into the ocean,

32:46.539 --> 32:51.353
the colour loses its identity completely.

32:52.413 --> 32:59.978
Think of the other way round.
If the ocean is coloured,

33:02.800 --> 33:10.563
and is poured into atmosphere

33:13.113 --> 33:18.954
or onto any part, any, any little wee bit,

33:18.979 --> 33:29.319
or onto any spot, onto any atom or
anything, it all becomes colourful.

33:30.797 --> 33:39.550
So the Spirit is like the ocean,
which has the light in it.

33:40.424 --> 33:48.901
And when this ocean pours into
the little cup of our brain,

33:48.926 --> 33:57.214
the cup loses its identity, and everything
becomes spiritual. Everything.

33:57.239 --> 34:00.017
You can make everything spiritual,
everything. You touch anything,

34:00.042 --> 34:05.386
is spiritual: this sand becomes spiritual,
the land becomes spiritual,

34:05.411 --> 34:10.715
atmosphere becomes spiritual,
celestial bodies become spiritual.

34:10.740 --> 34:14.625
Everything becomes spiritual.

34:15.118 --> 34:22.260
So is the ocean that is the Spirit,
while your brain is limited.

34:23.729 --> 34:30.054
So the detachment from your limited brain
has to be brought in.

34:30.079 --> 34:35.620
All limitations of brain should be broken,
so that when this ocean

34:35.645 --> 34:45.361
fills that brain, it should break
that little cup,

34:46.425 --> 34:50.297
and every bit of that cup should become
colourful.

34:50.322 --> 34:57.068
The whole atmosphere, everything,
whatever you locate, should be colourful.

34:57.093 --> 35:00.408
Colour of the Spirit is the light
of the Spirit;

35:00.433 --> 35:08.130
and this light of the Spirit acts, works,
thinks, coordinates, does everything.

35:08.155 --> 35:16.370
This is the reason today I decide
to bring Shiva Tattwa to the brain.

35:17.652 --> 35:22.382
The first procedure is to take your brain
towards the Shiva Tattwa by telling it,

35:22.407 --> 35:27.095
"See, where are you going, Mr. Brain?

35:27.120 --> 35:31.052
You're putting attention to this,
you're putting attention to that,

35:31.077 --> 35:34.662
getting involved - now detach, become
the brain yourself.

35:34.687 --> 35:38.735
Only the brain. Detach, Detach".

35:38.760 --> 35:44.287
And then, take this detached brain,
completely filled with the colour

35:44.312 --> 35:48.829
of the Spirit. It will automatically
happen.

35:48.854 --> 35:58.160
As long as you'll have these limitations
to your attention, it will not happen.

35:59.275 --> 36:08.161
So one has to really, deliberately
do this tapasya. Every individual.

36:10.422 --> 36:13.064
I'm with you;

36:14.932 --> 36:19.634
so you don't need any puja that way.

36:19.659 --> 36:29.156
But that state has to be achieved, and for
achieving that state, you need the puja.

36:31.840 --> 36:39.191
I hope, so many of you'll become
the Shiva Tattwas in My lifetime.

36:43.765 --> 36:47.146
But don't think I'm asking you to suffer.

36:47.171 --> 36:52.043
There is no suffering in this kind
of an ascent.

36:52.068 --> 36:57.380
If you understand that this is the complete
joyous state,

36:57.405 --> 37:00.699
that is the time when you become
Nirananda.

37:00.724 --> 37:05.347
That's the joy named in the Sahasrara,

37:05.372 --> 37:11.274
the name of the joy is Nirananda, and
you know your Mother's name is Nira.

37:11.299 --> 37:15.063
So you become Nirananda.

37:20.142 --> 37:26.386
So today's worship of Shiva has a special
meaning.

37:26.411 --> 37:32.955
I hope, whatever we do in the outward way,
in a gross way,

37:32.980 --> 37:37.006
happens also in the subtler way.

37:37.031 --> 37:40.641
I'm trying to push your Spirits into
your brains,

37:40.666 --> 37:49.058
but I find it rather, sometimes, difficult
because your attention is still involved.

37:50.941 --> 38:00.906
Try to detach yourself. Temper,
lust, greed - everything.

38:02.580 --> 38:08.124
Try to reduce. Like in food I told
today Warren,

38:08.149 --> 38:12.661
"Ask them to eat less, not like gluttonous
people." You see, once in a while,

38:12.686 --> 38:16.934
on a day of a big banquet or anything,
you eat more,

38:16.959 --> 38:24.025
but you can't eat every time like that.
It's not a sign of a sahaja yogi.

38:25.497 --> 38:30.435
Try to control. Try to control your
speech.

38:30.460 --> 38:36.138
Whether you express temper in your
speech or you express your compassion

38:36.163 --> 38:40.566
or you are artificially compassionate
- try to control.

38:40.591 --> 38:46.139
I know, some of you may not do much.
It's all right.

38:46.164 --> 38:50.650
I'll try to tell you many-a-times.
I'll try to help you.

38:50.675 --> 38:58.084
But most of you can do it, and you
should try that.

38:59.249 --> 39:04.464
So, on a deeper level, from today we
start our Sahaja Yoga,

39:04.489 --> 39:11.952
where some of you may not attain.

39:11.977 --> 39:16.724
But most of you should try to go deeper.
Everyone.

39:16.749 --> 39:19.920
For that, you don't need persons
who are very well educated

39:19.945 --> 39:24.131
or well placed in life. No, not at all.

39:24.156 --> 39:29.647
But people who meditate, dedicate,
go deeper,

39:29.672 --> 39:33.834
because they are like the first roots,

39:33.859 --> 39:41.778
which have to reach for others much
deeper, so that others can follow.

39:49.500 --> 39:55.958
Now for today's Puja, we’ll have a very
short Ganesh Atharva Sheersh.

39:55.983 --> 40:02.169
Just not washing My feet or anything
much on it,

40:02.194 --> 40:08.495
but is a saying of Atharva Sheersha,
and you can put...

40:11.679 --> 40:16.787
That is during Shiva puja there is no need
to wash My feet, as He’s already pure.

40:16.812 --> 40:21.577
Shiva is all the time clean,

40:21.602 --> 40:27.924
pure, immaculate. So what are you going
to wash the Immaculate?

40:28.102 --> 40:31.277
One may say that, "Mother, when You
wash Your Feet,

40:31.302 --> 40:35.695
we get Your vibrations in the water."

40:35.720 --> 40:42.913
But so detached that there’s no need
to wash,

40:44.123 --> 40:46.929
at a state

40:49.070 --> 40:56.873
where you get completely washed,
completely cleaned out.

41:04.206 --> 41:12.080
Then we’ll have a Devi Puja because Gauri,
who is Virgin, is to be worshipped.

41:12.105 --> 41:16.423
So we’ll say the hundred-and-eight names
of the Virgin,

41:16.448 --> 41:20.027
then we’ll do the Shiva Puja.

41:22.331 --> 41:29.339
I'm sorry, I cannot tell you everything
in one short speech all about this,

41:29.364 --> 41:39.361
but detachment must start expressing
itself in your Realization.

41:39.386 --> 41:42.259
Detachment.

41:44.389 --> 41:48.150
What is surrendering? Is nothing

41:48.175 --> 41:55.269
because when you are detached, you are
surrendered, automatically.

41:55.706 --> 42:00.795
When you are holding onto other things
you are not surrendered, that's all.

42:00.820 --> 42:03.620
What is there to surrender Me? I am such
a detached person,

42:03.645 --> 42:07.172
I don't understand all that. I mean,
what am I to get out of you?

42:07.197 --> 42:11.017
I am so detached. Nothing.

42:16.739 --> 42:23.468
So today I hope, we all pray that,
"Oh Lord, give us strength

42:24.259 --> 42:28.088
and that source of attraction

42:28.113 --> 42:31.827
by which we give up all other attractions
of all the pleasures,

42:31.852 --> 42:35.519
of joy of ego, of everything that we
think of,

42:35.544 --> 42:46.136
but we should fall into the pure joy form
of the Shiva Tattwa. Absolutely.”

42:46.161 --> 42:49.866
I hope I've been able to explain to you
why I am here today,

42:49.891 --> 42:53.164
and why today is a very big day.

42:53.189 --> 42:57.266
You all, who are here, are specially
very lucky people,

42:57.291 --> 43:02.046
who should think that God has been
kind to you,

43:02.071 --> 43:07.805
that He has chosen you today to be here
to listen to this.

43:11.050 --> 43:15.901
And then, once you get detached,
you'll start feeling responsible -

43:15.926 --> 43:19.386
Abhiyukta - responsible.

43:19.411 --> 43:25.832
But a responsibility, not giving ego,
but responsibility

43:25.857 --> 43:30.253
which is executing by itself,

43:30.278 --> 43:35.690
which is expressing by itself, manifesting
by itself.

43:39.502 --> 43:41.721
May God bless you.
