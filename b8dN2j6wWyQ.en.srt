2
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:11,434
Today we have gathered here

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:17,634
to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,801
as well as your own Kundalini.

5
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,868
First of all,

6
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:34,601
I think this is the most important thing to understand

7
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,968
about your own Kundalini,

8
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:41,767
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

9
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:45,033
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge

10
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:48,567
is this, your own Kundalini

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,167
because, when she rises,

12
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:57,033
she points it out,what are the problems on your chakras.

13
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,868
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

14
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:06,467
but we do not know what purity means.

15
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,200
It means your chaste desire.

16
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:15,167
It means it has

17
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:18,968
no lust, greed, anything in it.

18
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:23,467
That power is your own Mother

19
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:28,367
and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother.

20
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:32,200
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

21
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,734
She knows everything about you

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,434
and she is absolutely

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,601
the knowledge

24
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,801
because she’s so pure.

25
00:01:55,667 --> 00:02:00,067
And, whatever chakras she touches, she also knows

26
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:05,934
what's wrong with that chakra

27
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,601
beforehand,

28
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,367
so she's quite prepared,

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,634
and she adjusts herself

30
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,634
fully

31
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:28,234
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

32
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:34,367
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

33
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:41,667
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

34
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,267
Now, this Kundalini

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,601
is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

36
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:56,634
and within you, in a human being,

37
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:06,267
it is like many strands of energy.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,834
So it’s like a rope

39
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:16,133
and these energies are all twisted together

40
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:18,667
to form this Kundalini.

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,000
In a human being these strands are

42
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:30,934
3 into 7 — that is 21 raised to power 108!.

43
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:37,367
But when your Kundalini rises, one or two strands out of this

44
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,634
come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

45
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,968
Only one or two

46
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:48,334
because it has to pass

47
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:53,267
through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

48
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:58,400
It’s all a spiral throughout

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,601
because Kundalini is a spiral

50
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:11,367
and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

51
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:15,667
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

52
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:24,667
The outermost nadi is the right side [Pingala nadi]

53
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:32,534
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi [Left side].

54
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:41,634
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

55
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:48,334
By that, they relax the center.

56
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:51,834
By the relaxation of the center,

57
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:59,534
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

58
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:05,334
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

59
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:09,834
then your eyes start relaxing,

60
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,434
your pupils start dilating and

61
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:20,167
your eyes can become like Mine, very black,

62
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,267
absolutely relaxed.

63
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,334
So, you can easily see in a person

64
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,634
how far is the Kundalini.

65
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,567
If it has pierced the Agnya,

66
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:34,667
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

67
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:39,334
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

68
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:46,400
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

69
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,400
love, compassion and attention;

70
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,534
all these three things are in that energy.

71
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:06,868
We know of many energies; like electrical energy,

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,067
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

73
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:16,167
But these energies cannot think,

74
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,968
they cannot adjust,

75
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:22,567
they cannot work on their own.

76
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,367
They are to be handled by us.

77
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:33,067
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

78
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,801
and knows how to handle itself.

79
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:41,200
It thinks.

80
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:49,000
If you see a seed being sprouted,

81
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:54,200
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

82
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:58,734
which knows how to go around the soft places

83
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,868
and then how to encircle the stones

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,634
and then how to find its way to the source.

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,734
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

86
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,133
the way it moves.

87
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,834
But within you is

88
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:24,067
a tremendous force of Kundalini existing.

89
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:30,000
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

90
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:35,467
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

91
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:42,868
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

92
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:49,334
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

93
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:55,467
When people get realization,

94
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,367
they do not understand that they have to now grow.

95
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,934
And why they don’t grow? Because

96
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:07,000
they do not ask for these energies.

97
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:11,334
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

98
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:15,133
“I have to have more compassion.

99
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:20,033
My compassion is not all right.

100
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:25,067
My concern about others is not all right.

101
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:28,334
My generosity is not all right.

102
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:35,167
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love,”

103
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:42,267
then this energy starts moving,

104
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:47,634
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

105
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:53,234
But, if you do not want

106
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:06,801
to be growing in your awareness, then she says “All right,

107
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:10,767
he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

108
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:14,934
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored wit hin you.

109
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:20,427
I told you, 3 into 7, that is 21,

110
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,834
raised to power hundred and eight.

111
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,000
So what a storage you have within yourself!
