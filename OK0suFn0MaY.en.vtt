1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Tell me when I can start.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.760
You can start.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.920
You can start now.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.200
OK.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.360
Good evening, everyone.

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.920
I'm Christine Hage.

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.240
I'm born in France from Polish parents.

8
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.560
So I have stories about France, about Poland.

9
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.520
And I'm living happily in Vienna, Austria,

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.920
because Shwemataji gave me a lovely, strong Austrian husband.

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.480
So during my first India tour in 85, 86, it was in Raurie.

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.880
I heard for the first time the Mahalakshmi's totem.

13
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.800
I don't remember if it was a music program or during a puja.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.440
But when I heard this song for the first time, I mean, I was so moved.

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.200
I was blasted and I started to cry, to cry.

16
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.280
And in myself, I said, but why are you crying?

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.160
Shwemataji is here and you are crying.

18
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.800
And I looked at Shwemataji and she was crying too.

19
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.000
And at the end of the song, she said,

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
you see, it doesn't matter if you are singing or if you are listening.

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.160
When you feel the spirit, we are one.

22
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.920
And for this, also session with stories.

23
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.720
Doesn't matter who speaks or who listens.

24
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.280
But these stories, I mean, they are so fascinating

25
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.280
because they show the divine play, how Shwemataji.

26
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.880
For each one of us, and we are thousands,

27
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.080
created situations for every one of us to learn something about ourselves,

28
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.280
to go deeper in spirituality.

29
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.800
And we such love, such care, such humor also.

30
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.800
And only the divine can manage such show.

31
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.640
So I met Shwemataji for the first time in August 82 in Lausanne, in Switzerland.

32
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.040
I saw I was by chance there and I saw the poster of Shwemataji.

33
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.160
She was not the motherly face on this poster.

34
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.680
It was the guru face.

35
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.560
I looked at her and I said, oh, I know her.

36
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.680
She's strict, but I need someone strict to make order in my life.

37
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.880
And I went to the program.

38
00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.320
I was staying completely behind because I didn't want to be enrolled in a set.

39
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.360
So I observed everyone who was there.

40
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.000
And I saw at this time, Marie Martin was pregnant.

41
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.400
And I said to myself, oh, we can also get children when we do this yoga.

42
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:25.440
And Shwemataji came a little bit later, I mean, maybe 30 or 45 minutes.

43
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.680
She came and she was just walking majestically in her white siren.

44
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:42.640
Suddenly, a couple of Swiss people stood up and showed her the watch because she was too late and we are in Switzerland.

45
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.800
And Shwemataji just went on and she said, for God, there is no time.

46
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.840
Just to hear this, I said, she's the right one.

47
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.160
She is sent by God.

48
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:11.760
And after the realization, I mean, I just felt so strong vibrations and this confirmed what I was looking for all the time,

49
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.760
even when I was a child, because my name, Christine, there is Christ inside and I'm born in Pankot,

50
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:29.760
Kingston, and I knew I will once feel like the apostles, the Holy Ghost on my head.

51
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.080
And this was the time.

52
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.360
Shwemataji left the hall and I stayed in the hall.

53
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.120
I was alone. I couldn't go away.

54
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.640
And suddenly she was near me.

55
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.960
She took my hands and she said, did you feel it?

56
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200
And I just could answer, yes.

57
00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:01.120
And I felt as I don't know, I cannot describe what I felt, but like an energy, something that she gave me.

58
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.120
So I came back to Moulouse, to France.

59
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.840
I gave realization to some friends, to some relatives.

60
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.440
And we were a little group meeting every week to meditate.

61
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.200
And with the help of the Swiss yogis.

62
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.560
And this was, I met Shwemataji in 82, August 82.

63
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:35.240
In Easter 83, my friend Martin and me, we were teaching both of them.

64
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.480
We had holidays.

65
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.760
So we went to the ashram in Le Fournet at this time.

66
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.040
And for the first time, I entered a meditation room.

67
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.360
And this was also overwhelming to see all these pictures of mother.

68
00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.360
And I remember I just sat down and I spoke to Shwemataji.

69
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:13.520
I told her, please come in my town also to give realization to such a lot of seekers there.

70
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:25.480
In June 83, the five ladies from the province, from Moulouse, we went to Paris where Shwemataji gave programs in Paris.

71
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.240
When we were at the airport, Shwemataji came.

72
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.600
And from the group of the five ladies, I was the only one to have seen Shwemataji physically.

73
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.080
The other one just was on the picture.

74
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.720
And one told me she was expecting a princess or a queen to come.

75
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:55.560
And Shwemataji came just with a coat, with a scarf on her head like a normal lady.

76
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.760
And when she saw us, she said, why are you looking so serious all of you?

77
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:12.240
Thinking about your catches, about your problems, are you not happy to see your mother?

78
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.480
And she left.

79
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.320
And we didn't know where she's going to the flood of Mary or to the ashram.

80
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.400
So we decided to go to the ashram.

81
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.560
We just knew the direction.

82
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.240
We knew it's leurancy, but no address.

83
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.120
We went there.

84
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.520
We were in this place.

85
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.120
And suddenly we saw a house and a lot of shoes outside.

86
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.760
So we said, OK, it must be there.

87
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.000
So we enter the house.

88
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.800
And there was at this time not a lot of yogis, maybe 10.

89
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.200
And Shwemataji sitting in her armchair.

90
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.560
And the leader at this time said, come, come, come.

91
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.160
And I just came in front of Shwemataji.

92
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.280
I did namaste.

93
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.360
And he said, Shwemataji, this is Christine from Moulouse.

94
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.360
And she said, but I know her.

95
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.480
And she did like this to me, to come to her.

96
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.600
She took me.

97
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.560
She embraced me.

98
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.840
And she said, you are meeting again after 2000 years.

99
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.960
She confirmed what I was feeling already as a child,

100
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.120
that I was living in the time of Christ.

101
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.520
At the program, she did a program, evening program.

102
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.760
And at the end of the program, she

103
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.400
asked the yogis to come in front to help her

104
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.800
to work on the new people.

105
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.520
We from the province, we didn't know how to work on someone.

106
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.360
We didn't want to do something wrong.

107
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.000
So we stayed completely behind in the hole.

108
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.520
Someone came and gave me the coat of Shwemataji to hold.

109
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.400
Such vibrations coming out of this coat.

110
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.200
And all the five ladies, I mean, we

111
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.160
were feeling a little bit, how to say,

112
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:21.600
Schuldig guilty that we couldn't help Shwemataji.

113
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.400
But I tell you, we were just in total awareness

114
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.360
at this moment.

115
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.920
We were just looking at her, so happy to see her.

116
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.720
Shwemataji finished her session.

117
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.800
Someone took again away the coat of Shwemataji.

118
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.240
And she left the hole.

119
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.080
But when she passed near her, near us,

120
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.320
a little group of the five ladies, she stopped.

121
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.520
And she said, she did namaste, and she said,

122
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.280
thank you very much.

123
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.960
You have no idea how much you helped me this evening.

124
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.880
Thank you very much.

125
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.600
And this is pure Zen, action in inaction.

126
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.600
So this was in June.

127
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:21.280
And our first puja in a foreign country

128
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.280
was in England, Guru Puja in Lajjil.

129
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.560
And the 24th of July.

130
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.280
Oh, wait.

131
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.080
Before I have to tell you, I want

132
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.880
before I have to tell you that when

133
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.520
I was in the ashram of Switzerland,

134
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.920
I forgot to tell you that I meditate.

135
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.280
I asked Shwemataji to come to our place.

136
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.840
And after this, when I came out of the meditation room,

137
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.040
Arno told me, the leader at this time told me,

138
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.960
you see, Christine, Shwemataji's tour is already planned.

139
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.520
But write an invitation to her.

140
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.600
It might be that she's coming to Melus.

141
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:19.240
So with Martin and with our poor English,

142
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.320
we just wrote a little, little letter just

143
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.920
to thank Shwemataji to have given us the realization

144
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.840
that now we know the meaning of the word love, friendship,

145
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.720
and we would like her to come to give realization

146
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.200
to the seekers of our place.

147
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.480
And in Lajjil, the 24th of July, this

148
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.440
was the day of Holy Christine, Naman's Day.

149
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.400
Yeah, the day Arno came to me and he said, Christine,

150
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.880
Shwemataji is coming to Melus.

151
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.160
And she came the 1st of September,

152
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.440
the birthday of my sister.

153
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.960
I mean, this detail, this coincidence.

154
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:20.120
And she came and we were first in Switzerland

155
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.400
for the Krishna puja.

156
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.760
And we were not a lot of maybe 20, 25 people.

157
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.600
It was in the garden of the ashram.

158
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.880
And after we, Miss Martin, we left quickly to Melus

159
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.040
to prepare my flat for Shwemataji's coming.

160
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.960
In my bedroom, there was a cupboard.

161
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.720
And on this cupboard, there was such a lot of spots.

162
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.720
I wanted to get rid of these spots to clean.

163
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.520
And I took chemical things, you see, to clean.

164
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.080
Nothing went away.

165
00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.040
And after some time, I say, OK, I gave up.

166
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.920
I just took a little chiffon to the last chance

167
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.040
to put away the dust.

168
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.480
And suddenly, all the spots disappeared by themselves.

169
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.840
But in the same moment, Martin was in the kitchen cleaning

170
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.000
the candle holder.

171
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.840
And she shouted, Christine, what is happening?

172
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.040
The candle holders are cleaning by themselves.

173
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:35.080
And later on, yeah, we were told that already the Ghanas

174
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.400
and the deities were in this place

175
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.720
to help us to prepare Shwemataji's coming.

176
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:49.400
Shwemataji came from Basel to Melus by train.

177
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.800
And we organized an armchair, comfort table

178
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.960
that we rented.

179
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.440
We put some saris on.

180
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.240
But we forgot, completely forgot,

181
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.360
to prepare a table for her food when she was eating.

182
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.240
Can you imagine Shwemataji had her plate, warm plate,

183
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.280
on her lap to eat because there was no table?

184
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.520
And Warren, who was with Shwemataji,

185
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.080
was so cross with Martin as we me.

186
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.360
How would we dare not to sing about this?

187
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.240
I mean, he was really tough.

188
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.720
So we got a little bit of fright.

189
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.760
So I went to my neighbor to hold, to take a table.

190
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.760
And I came back with a table, a little table.

191
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.760
And Shwemataji, when she saw the table, she said, no, no, no,

192
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.320
no.

193
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.720
I don't need any table.

194
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.520
I'm completely satisfied.

195
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.160
You see, I could have eaten in the train.

196
00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.120
But I said, no, I want to eat in Melus.

197
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:08.160
I mean, this delicacy of her not to hurt her.

198
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.200
And also, she was asking me the permission

199
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.920
to use my telephone to phone to her husband in England.

200
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.040
She asked the permission.

201
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.760
The other yogis didn't.

202
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.720
They just took the phone and phoned.

203
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.800
And she did the program.

204
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.320
And at the end of the program, suddenly she said,

205
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.080
how is it that I'm here in Melus?

206
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.960
It was not planned.

207
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.080
It's only the desire of one woman who said.

208
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.200
And she repeated exactly the sentences

209
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.280
that I said in the meditation room in Switzerland.

210
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.400
And only me, I could understand this.

211
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.400
And history, I repeated history.

212
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.760
I told history also in the 90s when

213
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.320
we were in Poland to start Saja Yoga in Poland.

214
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.440
Because Annegret and me, we were just both of us

215
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.280
to do the programs twice a week.

216
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.920
And the people were asking, do you

217
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.960
think Śwematajik will come once to Poland?

218
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.640
We are such an incipient country.

219
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.840
And they were hesitating.

220
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.920
And I told them the story.

221
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.000
I said, look, when it was a desire of one woman,

222
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.280
we are here 200, 250.

223
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.480
If we have the desire, Śwematajik will come.

224
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.960
And Annegret also said, and let's give abandon.

225
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.520
And about abandon, Śwematajik also in Poland, in Warsaw,

226
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.560
gave us the meaning of abandon.

227
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.440
Because we told her that people were queuing so

228
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.680
that we work on them.

229
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.560
We were just both of them.

230
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.480
So we couldn't spend a lot of time to work on each one.

231
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.280
So either it was cool and it was OK, and it was warm.

232
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.120
So we just gave abandon.

233
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.160
And people asked us, what are you doing?

234
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.960
And we said, we are phoning to God without wire.

235
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.600
There was no handy at this time.

236
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.080
So we told Śwematajik this story,

237
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.280
and she was just laughing.

238
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.960
And after she told us the meaning of abandon,

239
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:43.000
she said, you see, when you do this movement in the water,

240
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.640
it's going very deep in the water.

241
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.840
When you do this movement here, and this is the Saṃsāra,

242
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.560
it's going deep in Paramṣaitanya,

243
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.480
who takes over all problems.

244
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.920
The day after this program with Anne-Grédre,

245
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.200
we went to the post office because her husband

246
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.520
was in Switzerland, and she wanted to call him.

247
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.880
And you know, at this time in the 90s,

248
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.720
we had to wait some time, hours, to have the connection

249
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.560
to the post office.

250
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.800
So I went and I told the lady, I gave her the phone number,

251
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.800
and I heard the medallion of Śwematajik.

252
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.160
She looked at me and she said, who is this lady?

253
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.640
I said, she's my spiritual mother.

254
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.640
She looked at me, she did the number,

255
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.960
and immediately we heard the connection.

256
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.760
And Anne-Grédre went in the cabin to phone,

257
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:51.120
and suddenly I heard she was shouting, Christine, Christine,

258
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.600
Śwematajik is coming to Poland.

259
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.040
The desire worked out.

260
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.240
But before going on with stories about Poland,

261
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.080
the story of my marriage.

262
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.000
This was in the first year of the marriage in Ganapati

263
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.320
Pule, 85, 86.

264
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.720
I was married to Hermann Hage, an Austrian.

265
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:29.680
And the day of the weddings, we had the ceremony of Haldi

266
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.560
in the morning at the beach time.

267
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.720
On the beach.

268
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.480
Śwematajik was sitting on a stone.

269
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.560
We were all the ladies around her,

270
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.080
and she spoke very strictly with us.

271
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:53.200
She said, you see, if you don't want to marry now,

272
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.520
you have to tell me now, because I don't want

273
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.040
you to make a man unhappy.

274
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.000
And never, never argue with your husband.

275
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.120
I mean, since this time I've improved,

276
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.480
but still there is a long way to do.

277
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.720
And she said, if there is some problems,

278
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.880
just give abandon, because you are the left side.

279
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.360
And all the dings and all the ganas will help you.

280
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.240
And we had to meet under the pendulum at 5 o'clock.

281
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:38.960
And all, we were here, two rows of yoginis, two rows of yogis.

282
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.800
Everybody was here, but not Hermann.

283
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800
He was not here.

284
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.480
The place was free near me.

285
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.720
But I didn't know where he is.

286
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.960
So I just meditated.

287
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.320
And suddenly, the voice of Śwematajik, Christine,

288
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.520
where is your husband?

289
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.400
I was already a little bit shocked,

290
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.280
because she said, husband, before the marriage.

291
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.760
And I looked at her, and I said, Śwematajik, I don't know.

292
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.360
And at this moment, I went completely on the left side.

293
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.280
I couldn't control it.

294
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.240
And in me came all these emotions

295
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.840
of the previous experiences.

296
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.080
They all wanted to marry me, and they left me.

297
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.560
And it's becoming again now in Sajja Yoga the same,

298
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.400
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

299
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.440
I couldn't stop this.

300
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.160
Suddenly again, Śwematajik, Christine,

301
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.920
where is your husband?

302
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.720
And I again told her, I don't know, Śwematajik.

303
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.480
But this time, I went completely on the right side.

304
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.080
In me, there was such an anger.

305
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.320
I couldn't control why is he not here.

306
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.560
He knew he has to come here.

307
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.760
And I couldn't stop.

308
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.640
And I wanted to meditate.

309
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:13.720
And I was really in a turmoil of thoughts.

310
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.040
And again, the voice of Śwematajik.

311
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.680
And I answered, desperate, I don't know Śwematajik.

312
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.840
And suddenly, she started laughing and telling everybody,

313
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.720
look at her.

314
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.720
She even doesn't know who is her husband,

315
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.360
because she didn't ask me this time, where is your husband?

316
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.880
But who is your husband?

317
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.160
But I didn't hear the question.

318
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.320
I was so involved in my thoughts and everybody laughing.

319
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.000
And I was thinking, how stupid you are now.

320
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.040
Everybody laughing about you.

321
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.080
What should I do?

322
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.640
And I remember what she said in the morning.

323
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.200
Just give abandon.

324
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.200
So I gave abandon.

325
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.480
And in my heart, I said, Śwematajik,

326
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.360
you know where he is.

327
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.320
And I looked and suddenly, he was here.

328
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.160
And now, Herman will tell his side of the story.

329
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.480
Hello, everybody.

330
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.960
Cześrīmatteci.

331
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.200
Cześrīmatteci.

332
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.560
So I'm the one who is responsible for this bad

333
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.280
feelings of Christine.

334
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:42.560
And how it happened, I can tell you shortly.

335
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.720
I was quite relaxed before the wedding.

336
00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.640
And I knew we have to meet.

337
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.520
It's a panel.

338
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.760
And she's not achieving it.

339
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.480
It's louder.

340
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.000
Louder?

341
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And so.

342
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.760
It's fine.

343
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.440
I can hear you fine.

344
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.600
Yes, it's fine.

345
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.520
Herman.

346
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520
My wife is fine.

347
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.280
She likes correct things.

348
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:17.560
So I was quite relaxed and was thinking I would just take my

349
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.240
time and see what happens.

350
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.400
And when I was looking around, there was nobody in.

351
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.440
So I said, my God, what's happening?

352
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.640
I have to hurry up.

353
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.160
So when I came to the panel, of course, everybody was there.

354
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:39.720
What I remember was there were about 56 couples sitting in four

355
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:47.200
rows and I was just at the end of what the situation.

356
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.040
Can you imagine?

357
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.240
Cześrīmatteci is still there.

358
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.480
I am at the end of the panel.

359
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.680
Where is my wife?

360
00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:03.480
And but suddenly I felt a force pulling me just in front.

361
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:09.520
And then I said, OK, I am not very astonished.

362
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.720
I have to excuse the Cześrīmatteci for my coming too late.

363
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.200
And when I came just in front, I saw Christine sitting there and

364
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.560
looking now happily.

365
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.040
OK, that's my plan.

366
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:37.080
OK, so to come back to Poland, just some stories were really

367
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.160
very strong for me.

368
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.080
They were very strong for me.

369
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.880
Once we were with Cześrīmatteci in a little shop of porcelain.

370
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:58.480
She bought such a lot of handicraft and handmade porcelain.

371
00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.680
Beautiful.

372
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.160
And the shop was very small.

373
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.760
And all the time there was a little boy, maybe five, six

374
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:15.640
years old from a gypsy.

375
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.240
And I must say he was very, very dirty.

376
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.040
His face, his hands.

377
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.800
All the time he came in and the owner of the shop was pushing

378
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.800
him back.

379
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.000
And he tried many a times.

380
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.520
And in the moment where in my head came these thoughts.

381
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.080
I mean, he should not come close to Cześrīmatteci.

382
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.480
He has her white sari.

383
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.640
He will spoil her sari.

384
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.000
I was thinking this.

385
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.560
It was in my head.

386
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.200
This little boy came.

387
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.720
Cześrīmatteci took him, embraced him, looked at me,

388
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.520
and she said, you see, he recognized me.

389
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.360
What a love.

390
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.640
And what a lesson for me.

391
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.800
Another story.

392
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.480
She was in the hotel preparing the present

393
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.200
to give to all the yogis.

394
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.800
And I was helping her.

395
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.480
And can you imagine?

396
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.520
You know, every now know how stupid the ego is.

397
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.360
And at this time, my ego was really so stupid.

398
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.960
All the time in my head, I had to have a special present

399
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.400
to get a special present because I started Sājāyoga

400
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.400
in Poland.

401
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.640
And I couldn't stop this.

402
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:55.680
So near Cześrīmatteci with all these stupid ego in my head,

403
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.960
I said, how can I stop this?

404
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.240
And in my safe, I just said, Cześrīmatteci,

405
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.400
please help me stop this thought.

406
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:14.720
In this moment, she took a box with an eclase and earrings,

407
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.240
and she gave it to me.

408
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.840
And she said, this is specially for you.

409
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.680
But I didn't feel well.

410
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:33.680
But the story is not over because afterwards, she

411
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.840
gave the same present to a lot of yoginis.

412
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:49.280
And she helped me just to be relaxed after this.

413
00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.680
Yeah.

414
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:05.360
After a program also, her feet were very, very swallowed

415
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.480
because she's absorbing all this negativity.

416
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.040
And she asked me to massage her feet.

417
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.760
And as soon as I touched her feet,

418
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.200
she was screaming out of pain.

419
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.920
And I was scared.

420
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.000
I didn't dare to touch her.

421
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.880
And she said, come, come.

422
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.000
And strong, strong, massage very strongly.

423
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.120
And for her tooth, she said, water came out, a lot of water.

424
00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:43.160
And she said, you see, Christ was crucified once.

425
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.360
I'm crucified every day.

426
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.040
Another time also by massaging her feet,

427
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.440
she said, do you see the light coming out of my feet?

428
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.520
I must confess I didn't see.

429
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.840
And she said, look, she said, every pore of my skin

430
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.800
is a universe.

431
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.040
You are massaging universes.

432
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.240
I mean, these are dimensions not for us human beings.

433
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:31.360
Yeah, these are the main stories I remember now about Poland.

434
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.560
And it would be nice now to pass on to Herman

435
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.280
to speak about a little bit about the Kabela.

436
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.840
Hello, thank you again.

437
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:58.360
So as I am an architect, I was very lucky that she

438
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.920
called me, like many architects, to Kabela

439
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.600
to help with the planning and all the things.

440
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.000
And I actually prepared some sequences

441
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.320
because there was a book in 95 which

442
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.360
was made of an Austrian yogi with pictures

443
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:29.200
and I had the opportunity to write the preface.

444
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.640
So I will read it here.

445
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.960
OK.

446
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:44.520
Trimataji herself sometimes moved from room to room

447
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.600
so as not to hinder the building work.

448
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.120
Her bed and pieces of furniture were carried from here to there

449
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.880
and everything was covered with a thick layer of dust.

450
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.120
This did not seem to bother Trimataji at all

451
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.640
as she always remained good-humored

452
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.000
in the atmosphere of chaos.

453
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.520
She hardly ever left the room where

454
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.480
she was staying at the time and never went up

455
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.440
to the upper floors.

456
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.400
However, she always knew what was going on everywhere

457
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.480
and she baffled the architects with her knowledge of details

458
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:31.960
that one could not have without going into these rooms.

459
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.720
Another one.

460
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.920
The original walls are approximately 1,000 years old

461
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.720
since the building was originally erected as a fortress

462
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.040
and a few hundred years later was covered into a castle.

463
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.440
The fortress characteristics can still

464
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.680
be seen in the four corner towers in front of the facade.

465
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.040
The south tower on the right-hand side

466
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:06.880
has a crack in the lower floors that is a few centimeters wide

467
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.200
and goes down into the foundations.

468
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.600
One company tried to convince Trimataji

469
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.960
to pay for a newly expensive restoration,

470
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:24.800
telling her that the house was in a great danger of collapsing.

471
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.720
Trimataji merely indicated that she

472
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.520
knew that this is part of the house stood on the rock

473
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.680
and the crack would not get any bigger.

474
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.280
Besides this, during the restoration,

475
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.600
she always let us know that Sri Krishna himself was holding

476
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.680
the house in his hands.

477
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.840
This must also be the reason why in spite

478
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.560
of some daring removals of walls and construction beams,

479
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.360
there was never any damage.

480
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:06.040
So I will end up with a personal experience

481
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.880
in front of Trimataji.

482
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.280
Sri was, we were talking about a plan,

483
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.960
and she was pointing to an outer wall

484
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.440
and was talking about a window.

485
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.080
And I knew there is no window.

486
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.760
So I was really get confused.

487
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.680
A couple of yogis were sitting around.

488
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.720
And we were just laughing.

489
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.400
They all had big fun.

490
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.120
I was confused.

491
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:39.240
And unconsciously, during I was talking,

492
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.120
I put my hand like this on the South.

493
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.840
I wasn't aware of this, said I did it.

494
00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.240
And suddenly, I knew what she meant.

495
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.600
She meant the window which wasn't there, actually.

496
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.720
And she wanted the window to have.

497
00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.600
So the workers immediately opposed and said,

498
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.960
but Trimataji, there are such thick walls.

499
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:09.600
The bricks are like cubes of some big centimeters.

500
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.920
And so she said, no, go on.

501
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.320
You will see.

502
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.680
What came out was there was a window before.

503
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.480
And they filled up the wall with little bricks.

504
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:28.440
So there was no problem at all to have.

505
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.440
It was no problem.

506
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.800
And there was a window which she knew.

507
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.480
And I was quite astonished, I must say,

508
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.520
because she never went to the basement.

509
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.200
She never went to the roof floor.

510
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.080
She never went to the attic.

511
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.280
And she knew every detail.

512
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.000
You cannot imagine.

513
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.160
So at least, what a luck for me to be there at this time.

514
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.880
Thank you.

515
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.600
Yes.

516
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.560
OK.

517
00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.800
Some stories about, for me, about Kavella also.

518
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:06.720
One story where also Caroline is involved without knowing.

519
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.680
Yeah.

520
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.400
It was like this, that Caroline was pregnant at this time

521
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.520
when we were there.

522
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:23.040
And I was, how to say, when I knew that she's pregnant,

523
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:29.080
suddenly came in me all negative emotions again

524
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.040
because I lost many a times a child.

525
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.960
I couldn't get a child.

526
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.360
And in Poland, she told me not to be pregnant again.

527
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.160
Otherwise, it could be dangerous for me.

528
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.320
And it was a Sunday, I remember, because on Monday,

529
00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.760
I was with Shrimataji.

530
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.160
Kalka was not there, and I was with her.

531
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.720
And all the night, I was just sad.

532
00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.120
I was just crying because I will never get a child.

533
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.440
I was caught up, for how we say.

534
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.720
And I said to myself, no, you are

535
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.720
going to Shrimataji to be with her,

536
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.120
and you are completely caught up.

537
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:18.080
And I was waiting for the door for her to call.

538
00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.640
And she called, and I opened the door.

539
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.560
I came in the room, and this beautiful picture.

540
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.560
You see this chimney with fire, and Shrimataji

541
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.320
staying near in the armchair.

542
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.680
And Shrimataji looked at me, and she said, oh, Christine,

543
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.920
you are looking now so much better.

544
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.120
You left the idea to get a child.

545
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.440
And the whole night, I was caught up

546
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.000
because I couldn't get one.

547
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.560
So I said to her, Shrimataji, I accept it because you told me,

548
00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.120
but in a way, this desire is stealing me.

549
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.040
And she said, no, no, no, no.

550
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.640
You see, to lose a child, it's always

551
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.600
such a short physical, emotional.

552
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.040
You are always looking so pale.

553
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.400
Now you are looking 10 years younger.

554
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.760
And what is it to get a child?

555
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.600
Food napkins, food napkins.

556
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.880
You couldn't do the job you did in Poland.

557
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.680
And your husband, he's like my husband.

558
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.080
After I got my second daughter, he

559
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.800
didn't want me to go through all this again.

560
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.400
And it's India.

561
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.880
It's a curse not to have a boy.

562
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.520
And I said to her, but Shrimataji, people

563
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.000
are asking me, what is wrong with me?

564
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.360
We chakra is catching.

565
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.160
Why do I not get a child?

566
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:04.600
At this moment, her face became completely dark.

567
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.520
I saw, I felt Shrimahakali here.

568
00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:15.240
And she said, who are these people who are torturing you?

569
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.600
They have no right to torture you.

570
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.600
They have to look after their own vibrations.

571
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.320
And I tell you, this was such a balzam for my heart.

572
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.200
And this balzam, I shared it once at a seminar in Kabela.

573
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.200
And you cannot imagine how many people were in the same

574
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:41.760
situation like me and how these words of Shrimataji helped us

575
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.560
all.

576
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.920
This compassion, she knows everything.

577
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.640
Another time in Kabela, I was alone with her in her room.

578
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.720
And she asked me, she said, Christine,

579
00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:02.640
how is it that you people, as soon as you got realization,

580
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.720
you took to Dharma?

581
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.760
When you open the TV, you always

582
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:14.600
see a man having his hand on a woman who is not his wife.

583
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.560
What to answer?

584
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.720
So I told Shrimataji, I mean, before Sajayoga,

585
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.040
I didn't lead a saintly life.

586
00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.080
But I was longing after this innocence.

587
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.200
And I found it in Sajayoga.

588
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.960
And she said, and these are punyas from previous lives,

589
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.960
because you all were great people in previous lives.

590
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:57.760
And maybe these situations that Herman already said,

591
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.800
with two or three yogis, we were asked,

592
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.400
Shrimataji asked us in a room to put all the cartons from one

593
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.800
side to another one to move also one bed.

594
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.960
And we were busy the whole day moving cartons from here

595
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.440
to here.

596
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.960
In the evening, she came in the room.

597
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.840
And she said, what did you do?

598
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.640
It's not the right place.

599
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.560
Please bring everything back.

600
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.800
So can you imagine if you start thinking to understand,

601
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.800
you are lost completely.

602
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:42.120
The only way was to surrender and to enjoy the vibrations.

603
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:48.720
And also in Kabela, she decided to go to Prague at this time.

604
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.680
And I was asked to go with her to Prague.

605
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.040
So for the preparation already, she

606
00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.280
told me, Christine, go in this room.

607
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.040
There are codes.

608
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.520
It's autumn.

609
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.000
And bring me the violet code.

610
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.880
I went in the room, a lot of codes, many colors,

611
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.960
but no violet codes.

612
00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.640
I went back to her.

613
00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:20.360
And I said, Shrimataji, there is no violet code.

614
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.360
Ooh, you are not supposed to say no to Shrimataji.

615
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.960
And I forgot it.

616
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.600
She looked at me.

617
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.800
And very strictly, she said, if I say there is a violet code,

618
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.520
this code is there.

619
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.160
Go and bring me this code.

620
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.080
Ooh.

621
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.520
I went quickly in the room.

622
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.120
No violet code.

623
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.360
What should I do?

624
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.560
But she helped me also with her inspiration.

625
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.920
I came back, and I said, Shrimataji, the violet code,

626
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.800
is it the room?

627
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.360
But with my human eyes, I didn't see it.

628
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.920
But she was just laughing.

629
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:14.720
And she said, OK, go and bring me a code, but not with fur,

630
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:20.440
because I don't want to show off in these countries.

631
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.960
In the plane?

632
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.240
No.

633
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.760
We were driving by car from Kabela to the airport.

634
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.480
And at the end of Kabela, there is a cemetery.

635
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.520
And passing near the cemetery, Shrimataji looked at it.

636
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.000
And she said, how is it?

637
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.720
I don't understand why human beings are building houses

638
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.200
for boots, because in Italy, they build this monument.

639
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.280
I can understand that human beings

640
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:58.280
are building temples, churches, cathedral to worship God.

641
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:04.040
But even this, she said, the real true temple is the heart.

642
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.320
In the plane, it was autumn.

643
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.680
And we were watching the nice autumn color of the forest.

644
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:21.640
And she said, look, it's like the fell of a tiger.

645
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.680
And I looked at her.

646
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.280
I said, Shrimataji, how beautiful is your creation?

647
00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.560
I mean, the nature.

648
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.520
No, I said the nature.

649
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.760
And she looked at me.

650
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.720
And she said, but you see, the beautiful are the human beings.

651
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.320
And we were flying over a river.

652
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.160
And she asked me the name of the river.

653
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.280
I knew it, but at this time, it was black out.

654
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.880
I couldn't find it again.

655
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.480
I said, Shrimataji, I don't remember.

656
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.040
Danube?

657
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:01.240
No, it's not the Danube, but it is something.

658
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.040
I knew it.

659
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.240
I knew it.

660
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.960
And suddenly, behind me, a man was whistling

661
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.120
the moldau of Smetana.

662
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.280
And I looked at her.

663
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.920
I said, Shrimataji, this is the moldau, the moldau.

664
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:23.480
And when we came into the hotel, one yogi put a cassette.

665
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:30.480
And he said, Shrimataji, a small piece of classical music.

666
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.120
And it was the moldau.

667
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.880
And she looked at me.

668
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.200
And she said, she knew it.

669
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.080
She knew it.

670
00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:43.840
And for the next story, I have to explain something

671
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.520
what happened before.

672
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.040
We were living in an ashram.

673
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.040
And one thing.

674
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.320
Yeah, OK, he wants to say something.

675
00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:56.840
Yeah.

676
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.040
Really short, some sense.

677
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.160
Really short, some sentences.

678
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.800
And I was flying Shrimataji from Warsaw to Prague.

679
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.720
And she did not talk much.

680
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:19.920
And she was sitting in this chair and sleeping, actually,

681
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.200
the whole time.

682
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.680
And when we landed, the plane was

683
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.880
pumping on this, when it was landing.

684
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.200
We were making some jumps.

685
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.640
And she woke up and looked at me and said,

686
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:41.200
you see, German style, because we were landing in Berlin.

687
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.080
We were landing.

688
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.160
OK.

689
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.680
OK.

690
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.320
Go on.

691
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.480
We were living in an ashram.

692
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.160
And we were meditating in the morning.

693
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.600
And once, the leader of this time

694
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.720
came to check our vibrations.

695
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:08.000
So he was sitting behind us, taking our vibrations.

696
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.920
Can you imagine how relaxed we were to meditate?

697
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.160
And after we had a breakfast together,

698
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.800
and we were only two women, there

699
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.720
was an ashram with men only.

700
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.600
And when my husband left, he told in front of everybody,

701
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.480
and Christine is catching, has the worst

702
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.800
vibrations of the ashram.

703
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.280
She's catching on Muladhara.

704
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.360
Boom.

705
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.160
I didn't show any reaction.

706
00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.600
But inside me, I was destroyed.

707
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.960
So when he left, I went out of the ashram.

708
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:51.400
And I called my sister in France to tell her this.

709
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.840
And my sister, she was good at this time,

710
00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.040
because she told me, you see, Christine, she just

711
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.600
gave us tests that we can bear.

712
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:08.240
And this was good for me, because no self-pity allowed.

713
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.920
And after I met my husband in the park,

714
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:18.600
and he also told me, you see, Christine, where is the problem?

715
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:23.200
Either you are catching on Muladhara,

716
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.680
you have to accept it and to work it out.

717
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.840
Or maybe he's an idiot, and it's completely not the case.

718
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:37.920
But why are you so destroyed by one sentence of someone?

719
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.840
You have to strengthen yourself inside and take

720
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:47.680
the divine weapons we have to forgive and to witness.

721
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.800
And when we were in Prague, Shimataji

722
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:56.400
heard our attention on this guy who in between left Saja Yoga.

723
00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.760
And someone told Shimataji this story about me.

724
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.360
Maybe it was my husband.

725
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.880
I don't remember.

726
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.280
And when we were alone in the room, Shimataji asked me.

727
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.320
He said, Christine, why are you?

728
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.560
Did you not tell me that this man was torturing you?

729
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.040
And I said, Shimataji, I took it as a big test

730
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.680
to forgive and to witness.

731
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.880
And she started laughing.

732
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:31.600
And she said she was speaking about this man telling

733
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.560
that he was feeling his own Muladhara,

734
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.160
because when he was near her, the Muladhara of Shimataji

735
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.480
was burning.

736
00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:49.840
And after these sentences that every yogi should hear once,

737
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:55.240
she said in Saja Yoga, no one has the right

738
00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.320
to use vibrations to judge someone.

739
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.680
And one more about Poland.

740
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.920
We were in a train station.

741
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.520
Shimataji came with a lot of suitcases.

742
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.480
And there was no chariot with a trailer

743
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.680
to put on the suitcases.

744
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.600
So the yogis went all around to look for a trailer.

745
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.520
And I stayed.

746
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.560
Shimataji near the suitcases.

747
00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.680
And suddenly, she said, look, this man is waiting for us.

748
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.520
It was a man with these electric chariot, I mean,

749
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.920
with a trailer.

750
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.040
I looked at her and I said, oh, Shimataji,

751
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.600
I would also like in my life all problems

752
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.880
to be solved so quickly.

753
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.000
And she looked at me and she said, it's very easy.

754
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.840
Just be relaxed.

755
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:05.200
So I just, as conclusion, I would

756
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:13.680
like to say the words Shimataji said in the 90s in India

757
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:19.160
for the inauguration of the new center, Nairida.

758
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.920
She said, she went into meditation.

759
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.240
We were a little group in a room.

760
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:31.720
And she said, you have no idea how beautiful the future is.

761
00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.720
You have no idea how beautiful it is.

762
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.600
But prepare yourself.

763
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:43.280
Before, you will get a lot of shocks.

764
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.520
But never, never doubt.

765
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:53.400
And don't lose the joy of the connection to the divine.

766
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:59.200
Meditate, meditate, meditate.

767
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:06.200
And meditate means to be in the state of thoughtless awareness,

768
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:12.240
this etheric area where no negativity can penetrate,

769
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:17.080
where yogis are building an aura of spirituality

770
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.640
around this Earth.

771
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.920
We are her hands.

772
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.360
We are her instruments.

773
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.960
So we should go more and more in this thoughtless awareness

774
00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.120
so that her love, her compassion can come on this Earth

775
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:41.960
and fight negativity wanting to destroy her creation.

776
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.040
Jai Shimataji.
