00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:25.589
there was a bra bracelet in water.

17
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.669
Just in water.

Yeah.

27
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:07.460
I didn't hear

28
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.779
this thing you're saying about the candle.

29
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.669
Oh,

30
00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.699

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.928
Oh,

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.320
I see.

33
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.140
You saw that.

34
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.970
That's good,

35
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.238
very good.

36
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.040
Now you want to give it a name,

37
00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:23.559
is it?

38
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.309
You better have your baby.

39
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.220
I'll give the name.

40
00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:40.140
Come along.

41
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.940
Just have your baby.

42
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.470
Thank you,

43
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.390
I'll keep it here.

44
00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:50.089
I will speak.

45
00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:51.649
All right.

46
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.880
You saw a bracelet there.

47
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.720
That's good.

48
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.410
That's very good to see a bracelet like that.

49
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.700
It's very good.

50
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.380
All right,

51
00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:00.049
sit down.

52
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.570
It's a good idea now.

53
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.630
I

54
00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.910
So

55
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.350
what's all the music and dancing and all that?

56
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.309
So I gave the right name to the right person.

57
00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.470
Mhm

58
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.739
No,

59
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:30.149
it's on there.

60
00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.779
There,

61
00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.230
there,

62
00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:32.140
let it sleep now,

63
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.989
wants to sleep.

64
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.350
It wants to sleep now.

65
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.470
Tell her.

66
00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.190
Well.

67
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.049
John,

68
00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.869
is it on?

69
00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:51.649
Maybe

70
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.320
So

71
00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.470
Let the little boy sit here because you see what I'm saying,

72
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.149
let them sit here,

73
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.989
all the little boys,

74
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.980
little children

75
00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.220
facing that side,

76
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.500
you have to face that side because there is going to be music and dance,

77
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.899
right,

78
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.790
a little bit like that.

79
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.709
You have to see the music.

80
00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:25.790
You sit here.

81
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.239
All of you see this and.

82
00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:32.350
So before the dance,

83
00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:33.619
we will have some songs.

84
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.980
Let the children come here if they want to.

85
00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:37.070
Now you sit down.

86
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.070
Will you sit down?

87
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:41.190
Won't you dolly.

88
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.649
Uh,

89
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.290
all the children come back here,

90
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.329
sit up to here,

91
00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:49.929
all of you.

92
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.010
Yes,

93
00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.410

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:51.010

95
00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:53.480
sit down nicely facing that side

96
00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:55.940
because the dance is going to be there.

97
00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:58.000
They're all children,

98
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.529
yeah.

99
00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.880
Hello.

100
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.359
So,

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:07.429

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.850
Yes,

104
00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:09.799
nice.

105
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:13.859
How is your daddy?

106
00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:15.589
Quite dry,

107
00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:16.119
all right.

108
00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:18.959
All right,

109
00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:19.390
OK,

110
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.880

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:22.309
come.

114
00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:24.739
It's all right,

115
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:25.660
but she's right.

116
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.540
You come now.

117
00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:34.220
Yes

118
00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:35.890
I

119
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.299
Sit down,

120
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.809
sit here,

121
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:38.230
sit here

122
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:40.709
come up.

123
00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:42.890
You

124
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.440
You see

125
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:50.390
I

126
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.670
That

127
00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:54.529
I.

128
00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:06.869
Mm.

129
00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:08.910
the

130
00:08:10.929 --> 00:08:10.940
Do

131
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.480
I

132
00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:15.630
Yeah,

133
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.019
yeah,

134
00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:17.149
come and sit here,

135
00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:18.019
sit here.

136
00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:20.230
It's a lot of room for all of you.

137
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.630
Nice.

138
00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:23.410
Hm.

139
00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:29.910
Look at the sparkling eyes.

140
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.380
Where is Olympia?

141
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.330
She's gone off to sleep.

142
00:08:45.099 --> 00:08:45.109
Mm.

143
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.099
So it should be.

144
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.030
We would like to offer.

145
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.659
At your

146
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:55.630
lotus feet.

147
00:08:56.489 --> 00:08:58.000
This dance and this music

148
00:08:58.609 --> 00:08:59.489
which is our.

149
00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:02.609
First attempt in Italy of integration

150
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.390
between

151
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.469
Indian and Western performing arts.

152
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760
So.

153
00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:11.070
Dania

154
00:09:11.219 --> 00:09:12.289
give me the spectacles,

155
00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:12.859
maybe I might,

156
00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:15.260
so the dance.

157
00:09:16.109 --> 00:09:18.469
Should represent the beginning.

158
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.919
Of the great work of Sriadi Shakti.

159
00:09:23.049 --> 00:09:24.169
And uh

160
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.760
it is contemporary Western dance,

161
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.250
which is quite free from the classical uh

162
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.210
patterns of Western dance.

163
00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.460
And the music

164
00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:36.619
is an attempt of uh

165
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.309
uh.

166
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.369
Finding in the Western music the links with the Indian music

167
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.140
and so we found that the uh.

168
00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:48.299
Correspondents of the

169
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.989
Indian ragas are the so-called Gregorian moods.

170
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.140
Gregorian moods,

171
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.090
which were the scales used in the Middle Ages up to the

172
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.119
of the

173
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.750
beginning of the 17th century,

174
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.559
did you see the Gregorian boots?

175
00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:05.849
No,

176
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.630
moods.

177
00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:12.799
Boots with M like Milano and um like Bologna.

178
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.320
Thank you,

179
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:14.659
thank you.

180
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.090
And for the rhythmical part,

181
00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:20.450
we have chosen

182
00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:24.020
some reeds which could actually somehow fit both in India

183
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.450
and in the West and some of these reeds,

184
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.729
uh,

185
00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:30.419
rhythmical patterns are from the East Europe like Bulgaria,

186
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.409
all these sort of things.

187
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.260
So this is just the very first experiment.

188
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.229
The music is being composed by Federico himself.

189
00:10:57.349 --> 00:10:59.289
Now you turned round and see her dance.

190
00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:01.609
Yeah

191
00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:04.000
Oh.

192
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.599
Just turn down.

193
00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:08.280
Tell them

194
00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:11.210
these children also done that.

195
00:11:14.669 --> 00:11:14.809
Yes,

196
00:11:14.859 --> 00:11:16.359
it's like this if you sit down.

197
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.500
And for the instruments

198
00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:23.500
we also try to integrate the things

199

200
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.659
With the sitar bridge,

201
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.659

202
00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:32.989

205
00:11:34.349 --> 00:11:35.179
it's on tape.

206
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.190

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:51.130
Yes.

211
00:11:52.469 --> 00:11:54.020
It's contemporary just one month ago.

212
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:56.080
In the present.

213
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.390
You see there.

214
00:20:54.489 --> 00:20:55.949
That's a challenge of property.

215
00:20:57.479 --> 00:20:58.369
This is ballet dancing.

216
00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:00.400

It looks so beautiful and graceful.

225
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.410
The way they use horrible dresses for men and women is horrifying.

226
00:21:18.089 --> 00:21:19.900
Absolutely horrifying.

227
00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:21.810
If they use nice dresses,

228
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:22.760

00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:23.050

398
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.239
we all adore you.

399
00:49:57.409 --> 00:49:58.389
We love you.

400
00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.040
You give us such happiness,

401
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.560
Mother.

402
00:50:01.129 --> 00:50:02.159
We all pray

403
00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:03.520
that you give

404
00:50:04.169 --> 00:50:05.510
light to our path.

405
00:50:06.469 --> 00:50:07.270
Thank you so much.

406
00:50:07.389 --> 00:50:08.310
Thank you from the heart.

407
00:50:23.969 --> 00:50:24.229
Uh,

408
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.500
you can pass that there,

409
00:50:25.629 --> 00:50:26.100
please.

410
00:50:31.409 --> 00:50:34.270
Should we translate the 2nd 1 that's coming also?

411
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.790
You let him translate the 2nd 1.

412
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:37.629
Hello.

413
00:50:37.879 --> 00:50:39.459
Let him translate the 2nd 1.

414
00:50:39.639 --> 00:50:40.030
Hello.

415
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.540
Let him translate the second one,

416
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:47.610
and then you can see.

417
00:50:48.449 --> 00:50:49.379
Just to read the translation.

418
00:50:50.409 --> 00:50:50.600
Yes,

419
00:50:50.719 --> 00:50:51.879
firstly the translation.

420
00:50:54.989 --> 00:50:55.699
Give that

421
00:50:57.699 --> 00:50:58.300
Loudspeaker,

422
00:50:58.379 --> 00:50:58.659
yeah.

423
00:51:00.889 --> 00:51:01.360
That's better.

424
00:51:01.489 --> 00:51:03.239
Always translate it first it's better.

425
00:51:06.439 --> 00:51:07.669
This is the next song.

426
00:51:08.439 --> 00:51:09.429
Spain is so lucky.

427
00:51:10.629 --> 00:51:14.550
And so the Spanish are of having you as our mother

428
00:51:14.939 --> 00:51:16.310
with such a great heart,

429
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.830
with such a great heart,

430
00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:19.760
which gives shelter to everyone.

431
00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.219
All the Spanish now

432
00:51:22.739 --> 00:51:24.550
come to offer their heart

433
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.370
to mother and to our brothers

434
00:51:26.979 --> 00:51:28.290
who have always helped.

435
00:51:29.159 --> 00:51:30.520
To bring Spain up,

436
00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:31.699
which,

437
00:51:31.889 --> 00:51:33.560
which has really been hard.

438
00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:37.360
Well,

439
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:38.030
thank you,

440
00:51:38.209 --> 00:51:38.570
thank you,

441
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:39.139
mother,

442
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:40.679
for giving so much

443
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:41.750
so that we,

444
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:43.080
your beloved children

445
00:51:43.409 --> 00:51:45.120
have finally reached here.

446
00:51:46.389 --> 00:51:46.629
Just

447
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.360
I have that.

448
00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:04.790
My

449
00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:11.189
Oh.

450
00:52:32.379 --> 00:52:32.389
Yeah

451
00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:35.729
No.

452
00:52:57.689 --> 00:52:57.699
I.

453
00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.020
lucky as

454
00:53:33.239 --> 00:53:33.840
But I

455
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:36.649
Too.

456
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:38.409
The.

457
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:48.929
My.

458
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Now they.

459
00:54:58.530 --> 00:54:58.540
Uh,

460
00:55:01.409 --> 00:55:02.000
just see

461
00:55:02.379 --> 00:55:04.709
how much joy they have brought for all of us.

462
00:55:05.659 --> 00:55:09.750
And we are very thankful to them for bringing this joy all the way from Spain.

463
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.250
I know it was hard

464
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:13.780
in the beginning.

465
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.030
But

466
00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:17.939
But

467
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.889
I tell you I love you very much,

468
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:22.850
the Spanish.

469
00:55:23.989 --> 00:55:24.270
Really,

470
00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:24.979
I love you.

471
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:27.330
And to see you here.

472
00:55:29.399 --> 00:55:30.590
Makes me so hopeful.

473
00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:32.669
That someday

474
00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:35.060
the whole of Spanish will become such.

475
00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:40.129
In my face,

476
00:55:40.169 --> 00:55:42.010
there's some resemblance with Spanish people,

477
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:42.679
I think.

478
00:55:43.209 --> 00:55:45.879
So many people have remarked that I look like a Spanish.

479
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:48.879
Must have been some forefathers living there.

480
00:55:50.729 --> 00:55:53.040
The way I'm attached to Spain,

481
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:54.760
apart from that.

482
00:55:55.909 --> 00:55:56.449
Though

483
00:55:57.419 --> 00:55:58.649
It in the beginning.

484
00:55:59.429 --> 00:56:00.840
It looked rather difficult.

485
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:07.020
I went again and again and I knew it would work out and again this time I'm coming.

486
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.350
For a longer period,

487
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.909
may God bless.

488
00:56:22.949 --> 00:56:24.010
It'd be in July,

489
00:56:24.139 --> 00:56:24.659
isn't it?

490
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.669
That's in July.

491
00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:28.959
I think in July,

492
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:29.580
August,

493
00:56:29.679 --> 00:56:30.270
July.

494
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:32.840
No,

495
00:56:32.919 --> 00:56:33.000
no,

496
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:33.560
July

497
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.100
in September

498
00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.590
because it's very hot there

499
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.189
and you,

500
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.270
you told me that there will be holidays,

501
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.909
so September will be the best,

502
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:42.600
all right.

503
00:56:45.149 --> 00:56:46.139
Yes.

504
00:56:48.489 --> 00:56:49.149
What happened?

505
00:56:53.479 --> 00:56:54.280
He's been crying.

506
00:56:56.409 --> 00:56:56.780
Right

507
00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:01.889
I

508
00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:03.929
Ouch,

509
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.030
but you know that because.

510
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:06.949
What is happening?

511
00:57:07.229 --> 00:57:08.060
Why is he crying?

512
00:57:09.969 --> 00:57:09.979
Yeah,

513
00:57:09.989 --> 00:57:10.270
I told him to be,

514
00:57:10.669 --> 00:57:13.689
I ask him now to do because he's always distracting the other children.

515
00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:16.110
Is it he's got a little aria,

516
00:57:16.159 --> 00:57:16.739
I think.

517
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:17.669
All right.

518
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.030
All right,

519
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:20.229
all right.

520
00:57:23.929 --> 00:57:26.219
All the children should behave

521
00:57:26.879 --> 00:57:27.320
beautifully.

522
00:57:27.399 --> 00:57:28.969
You look so nice and beautiful,

523
00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:29.919
isn't it?

524
00:57:29.989 --> 00:57:31.500
And you are sitting in the stage,

525
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.429
on the stage.

526
00:57:32.679 --> 00:57:34.030
Everybody is watching you.

527
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.030
Such beautiful things you are,

528
00:57:37.239 --> 00:57:38.110
aren't you

529
00:57:38.879 --> 00:57:40.000
all very nice,

530
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.149
beautiful,

531
00:57:41.479 --> 00:57:42.909
and behaving very well.

532
00:57:51.909 --> 00:57:52.270
All right.

533
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:53.989
So Shimai,

534
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.250
now we will have some

535
00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.750
budgets from France.

536
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.909
With the connection.

537
00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:18.020
via dra.

538
00:58:26.149 --> 00:58:26.229
The

539
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:31.260
Bega.

540
00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:34.360
I

541
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:42.120
practise querigayena.

542
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:44.929
Yeah

543
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.739
basic video where I just saw.

544
00:59:03.919 --> 00:59:04.020
just

545
00:59:24.709 --> 00:59:24.959
Cale.

546
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.000
Please pass on the word.

547
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:34.889
just

548
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:37.750
Man so many friends,

549
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:38.550
just do that.

550
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:40.870
So many friends.

551
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:48.080
It's,

552
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.300
it's a basically a very old Maratti song.

553
00:59:52.379 --> 00:59:53.209
Um,

554
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:53.800
and,

555
00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:54.350
uh,

556
00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.729
I've heard Sri Mataji sometimes,

557
00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:57.290
uh,

558
00:59:57.379 --> 00:59:59.449
saying it and she liked it very much.

559
01:00:00.489 --> 01:00:04.199
And that's why we thought of seeing it in front of her.

560
01:00:12.469 --> 01:00:12.659
No

561
01:00:13.239 --> 01:00:13.340
Uh

562
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.870
In my

563
01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:21.629
I couldn't be me.

564
01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:30.679
she.

565
01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:32.500
So

566
01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:39.560
Yeah.

No

575
01:01:35.889 --> 01:01:35.899
Yeah.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:36.800
I need

01:01:39.479 --> 01:01:39.500

596
01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:21.570
I shall be a.

597
01:03:26.639 --> 01:03:26.669
Malani.

598
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.810
you

599
01:03:37.909 --> 01:03:37.919
Go.

600
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:44.060
No.

601
01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.209
Yeah.

602
01:03:56.669 --> 01:03:56.739
that

603
01:03:58.810 --> 01:03:58.959
I

604
01:04:00.159 --> 01:04:01.110
So.

605
01:04:04.439 --> 01:04:04.600
Yeah

606
01:04:06.449 --> 01:04:06.459
And.

607
01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:19.969
Yeah

608
01:04:22.679 --> 01:04:23.129
Ah.

609
01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.760
If the French can sing Maratti songs,

610
01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:30.360
I should learn French.

611
01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.429
But French is very difficult,

612
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.429
you know that I've tried many times,

613
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:36.679
I can't say many

614
01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:38.110
words somehow.

615
01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.030
And

616
01:04:40.399 --> 01:04:43.560
it's surprising how you people are singing so beautifully,

617
01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:44.750
so correctly.

618
01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.629
The pronunciations of Marathi are very difficult,

619
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.270
but I don't know how you people are singing so well.

620
01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:51.790
May God bless you.

621
01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.979
Now we'll be singing Polish.

622
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.110
It's a prayer.

623
01:05:08.399 --> 01:05:10.879
It's Lord Lord's Prayer in Polish.

624
01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:12.310
OK

625
01:05:13.719 --> 01:05:13.739
What language?

626
01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:17.469
OK

627
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.429
You

628
01:05:20.649 --> 01:05:24.070
No no your teeth on the mic and nobody.

629
01:05:27.129 --> 01:05:28.290
But I can't do it.

630
01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:31.540
This.

631
01:05:45.979 --> 01:05:45.989
Uh

632
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:11.290
Mhm

633
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:05.840
Um

634
01:07:46.899 --> 01:07:46.909
Yeah

635
01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.859
I used to remember Polish people at this time.

636
01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:53.200
They are in difficulties.

637
01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.410
They have been always in difficulties.

638
01:08:55.779 --> 01:08:57.569
They have been facing all kinds of

639
01:08:58.729 --> 01:09:00.200
Aggression all the time.

640
01:09:00.509 --> 01:09:03.500
Nice to sing in Polish language and to think about them.

641
01:09:03.879 --> 01:09:05.879
One day they should also come to Sir yoga.

642
01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.450
We have some very few Polish.

643
01:09:11.339 --> 01:09:12.040
In London,

644
01:09:12.129 --> 01:09:13.129
but very few of them.

645
01:09:19.649 --> 01:09:19.680
And we have

646
01:09:25.339 --> 01:09:25.859
one in French also I must say.

647
01:09:25.879 --> 01:09:26.379
I think it's.

648
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:29.299
What is that?

649
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.790
That's better if we have.

650
01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:37.370
I hope one time we will be able to sing in French.

651
01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:38.060
Hold on.

652
01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:41.328
I have,

653
01:09:41.337 --> 01:09:41.349
yes.

654
01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:49.990
Uh

655
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:30.609
Um

656
01:10:35.589 --> 01:10:35.680
we

657
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.069
Oh.

658
01:11:10.509 --> 01:11:10.520
Um

659
01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:07.540
Yeah

660
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:54.979
Mhm

661
01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:27.129
Right.

662
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.959
Yes.

663
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500
I

664
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.899
Thank you very

665
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:56.279
much.

666
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.569
No.

667
01:14:18.049 --> 01:14:18.060
Don

668
01:14:20.549 --> 01:14:21.459
It's Mudan.

669
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.020
It's not,

670
01:14:22.379 --> 01:14:23.100
it's Murudan.

671
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:25.779
This is a sophisticated one.

672
01:14:27.089 --> 01:14:28.370
This one is it's not do,

673
01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:29.009
this is.

674
01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:31.270
Ah

675
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:36.500
It's a sophisticated one.

676
01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:43.709
So Sma you now we have the Swiss yogis.

677
01:14:44.649 --> 01:14:45.560
We'll see some

678
01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:46.109
budgets.

679
01:14:46.129 --> 01:14:46.450
I don't know,

680
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:47.490
maybe in Chinese or.

681
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:51.250
Rush,

682
01:14:51.299 --> 01:14:51.740
I mean.

683
01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:05.069
Mhm.

684
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:10.660
She's common to all I think.

685
01:15:20.069 --> 01:15:20.160
Yes

686
01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:28.470
As we see

687
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.870
very often such yogiss look very much like each other.

688
01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:36.279
come in.

689
01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:39.149
I

690
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.729
Not bad.

691
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:52.009
The dog is gone up.

692
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.350
I

693
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.060
You

694
01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:04.540
Yeah.

695
01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.939
I think um he's not really a Swiss.

696
01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:13.169
I don't know.

697
01:16:13.299 --> 01:16:16.040
It's not really a Swiss group because actually we are Swiss,

698
01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:16.850
Austrian,

699
01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:17.250
uh,

700
01:16:17.299 --> 01:16:18.089
Indian,

701
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:18.109
uh

702
01:16:18.459 --> 01:16:20.770
uh Algerian,

703
01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:21.569
um,

704
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.100
what else?

705
01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.169
Portuguese,

706
01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:23.979
French,

707
01:16:24.109 --> 01:16:24.350
uh,

708
01:16:25.299 --> 01:16:26.450
who is Portuguese?

709
01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:27.850
Who is Portuguese.

710
01:16:30.479 --> 01:16:30.720
Uh

711
01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:33.680
That's great.

712
01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:39.899
So in short,

713
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:41.540
they are all surgeries.

714
01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:43.169
T

715
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:53.990
That's

716
01:16:59.250 --> 01:16:59.259
Yeah.

717
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.169
What's that

718
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.410
Just

719
01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:14.600
The same thing.

720
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:17.609
You.

721
01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:20.629
So

722
01:17:27.919 --> 01:17:28.009
have

723
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.319
God

724
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:40.259
Integrated.

725
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.279
So

726
01:17:42.209 --> 01:17:43.080
the first song,

727
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:46.189
the first song is actually taken from the Debi Mahatma G.

728
01:17:48.049 --> 01:17:49.680
It's supposed to be on page.

729
01:17:51.379 --> 01:17:53.720
We're not really organised as we should be,

730
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:54.189
but,

731
01:17:54.209 --> 01:17:54.479
uh,

732
01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:55.020
it's

733
01:17:55.589 --> 01:17:58.370
it's somehow about in page 8 because we don't have numbers on our,

734
01:17:58.529 --> 01:17:59.049
on our pages.

735
01:17:59.169 --> 01:18:00.319
Everybody who is having the

736
01:18:00.689 --> 01:18:02.240
blue booklets and the

737
01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:04.930
brown booklets.

738
01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:08.709
So the name of the song,

739
01:18:08.919 --> 01:18:11.750
we just took some verses from the Divi Mahatmam

740
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.959
and the refrain which everybody can sing is actually um.

741
01:18:17.399 --> 01:18:17.640
Greg,

742
01:18:17.799 --> 01:18:18.520
can you translate?

743
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.560
Because we have the French version on it.

744
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:22.129
Uh,

745
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.740
the,

746
01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:27.770
the refrain everybody can sing is sarva mangala mangalishibi sarvata sadique

747
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.109
Sharan triambique gai

748
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:31.839
Nirmalamanamotu.

749
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:35.950
I

750
01:18:38.410 --> 01:18:39.890
The tune means

751
01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:42.129
uh it is you who.

752
01:18:42.959 --> 01:18:42.970
Uh

753
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:46.100
Distribute

754
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:47.350
all blessings.

755
01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:49.399
And benedictions,

756
01:18:49.439 --> 01:18:51.470
all you who are auspicious and who

757
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.029
protect the universe.

758
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:54.959
Everything

759
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.060
is realised

760
01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:57.620
through you.

761
01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.890
You are the white goddess with 3 eyes.

762
01:19:05.009 --> 01:19:06.000
How much do you,

763
01:19:06.129 --> 01:19:07.040
Narayani.

764
01:19:12.759 --> 01:19:12.990
know

765
01:19:18.459 --> 01:19:18.470
He

766
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.529
the first.

767
01:20:26.049 --> 01:20:26.060
I

768
01:20:52.589 --> 01:20:52.709
was

769
01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:58.370
He

770
01:22:01.359 --> 01:22:01.470
Yeah

771
01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:09.669
This was too strong.

772
01:22:14.169 --> 01:22:15.569
These are all mantras.

773
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:17.430
And the whole

774
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.589
Chakra start moving and revolving

775
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:23.000
fast with it.

776
01:22:25.279 --> 01:22:27.160
It was wonderful for you too.

777
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.410
organise all this

778
01:22:29.939 --> 01:22:31.370
and to sing it so well.

779
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:33.000
It's in Sanskrit,

780
01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:34.399
it's a difficult language.

781
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.029
And singing with such understanding.

782
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.020
I really congratulate

783
01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:41.919
all of you,

784
01:22:42.209 --> 01:22:43.580
especially the way he sang,

785
01:22:43.689 --> 01:22:44.919
was wonderful,

786
01:22:45.209 --> 01:22:46.600
tremendous it was.

787
01:22:47.009 --> 01:22:47.930
May God bless you all.

788
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.859
You will try to be as strong as the Italian in imitating the Indian songs.

789
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:14.729
I think I don't think uh.

790
01:23:16.319 --> 01:23:16.399
Italian the Italian.

791
01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.330
They are better than the real.

1001
01:41:57.819 --> 01:41:57.959

I.

1009
01:42:29.859 --> 01:42:29.939
And

1010
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.319
Uh

1011
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.910
I

1012
01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:40.209
So.

OK.

1017
01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:54.939
I

1018
01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:57.029
Maybe

1019
01:42:58.740 --> 01:42:59.359
I got

1020
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:04.069

So

1024
01:43:29.049 --> 01:43:29.109
But

1025
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.970
I

1026
01:43:52.509 --> 01:43:52.520
I.

1027
01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:00.399
So.

1028
01:44:06.979 --> 01:44:07.330
I

1029
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:09.100
Oh

1030
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:12.060
I

1031
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:14.129
I.

1032
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:20.290
Sahajana Sahanaina Moksha Badashinaga.

1033
01:44:32.770 --> 01:44:32.810
I.

1034
01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:35.729
That.

1035
01:44:40.029 --> 01:44:40.040
I.

1036
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:42.450
I got a

1037
01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:45.390
I.

1038
01:44:50.509 --> 01:44:50.700
Ma.

1039
01:44:52.939 --> 01:44:53.709
To those

1040
01:44:58.399 --> 01:44:58.410
The.

1041
01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:09.319
Ma.

1042
01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:15.149
To.

1043
01:46:20.939 --> 01:46:21.180
Uh,

1044
01:46:21.259 --> 01:46:21.450
this,

1045
01:46:21.459 --> 01:46:22.220
as I told you,

1046
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:23.939
the song is written by Moorreshwar.

1047
01:46:25.649 --> 01:46:27.279
He was the son of a humble

1048
01:46:27.899 --> 01:46:28.450
fisherman.

1049
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:30.020
When he was a very,

1050
01:46:30.029 --> 01:46:30.879
very young boy,

1051
01:46:30.979 --> 01:46:31.830
he wrote this thing.

1052
01:46:32.569 --> 01:46:34.740
And now he's got a scholarship and all that.

1053
01:46:34.759 --> 01:46:36.250
Now he's in the final year

1054
01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:37.839
of his arts

1055
01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:41.000
college where he'll get a degree in arts.

1056
01:46:41.339 --> 01:46:41.890
So

1057
01:46:42.419 --> 01:46:43.049
this is uh,

1058
01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.200
and he has such

1059
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:46.339
Such capacity

1060
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:48.669
not only that he has written this song,

1061
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:49.779
which is very,

1062
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:50.120
very

1063
01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.529
Fast and very touching to the heart,

1064
01:46:53.729 --> 01:46:55.930
but he has written a complete what we call

1065
01:46:56.250 --> 01:46:56.709
the

1066
01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.020
Mahat

1067
01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:03.990
just like we have Devi Mahathir like that he has written

1068
01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:05.729
about me near Mala Mahat,

1069
01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:10.740
a complete thing he has written which is read by every Maharashtra every day,

1070
01:47:10.779 --> 01:47:11.729
every morning.

1071
01:47:11.979 --> 01:47:12.549
It is about,

1072
01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:13.169
I think

1073
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:14.459
16 pages,

1074
01:47:14.609 --> 01:47:15.209
small thing,

1075
01:47:15.319 --> 01:47:17.459
and you have to open one by one,

1076
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:20.500
and that's what this little boy wrote long time back.

1077
01:47:21.029 --> 01:47:23.399
Now the first one is the one I must tell you

1078
01:47:23.399 --> 01:47:30.100
that as Magato zogava Magato zoga zoga means joke.jog means yoga.

1079
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:32.459
I ask for yoga.

1080
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:34.580
Where do I ask for yoga?

1081
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:36.470
Isahaja yoga cha darba

1082
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.859
in the

1083
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:39.740
court of Sayoga

1084
01:47:40.069 --> 01:47:42.830
while Mata Nirmala is sitting at the satra.

1085
01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.660
I'm asking this very simple style

1086
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:46.859
in Indian,

1087
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:49.180
which is say in Maharashtra,

1088
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:51.490
they have a thing called yoga,

1089
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:53.350
a style of singing yoga.

1090
01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.939
Yoga means when you ask for yoga,

1091
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:58.950
and this is one of them in the villages,

1092
01:47:59.029 --> 01:48:00.930
they have been singing this since long.

1093
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:03.729
This yoga is one of them you must have heard in the

1094
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:05.879
uh thing that is one yoga,

1095
01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:06.259
uh,

1096
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:07.790
thing that I will ask for yoga.

1097
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:08.979
I'll give up that.

1098
01:48:09.029 --> 01:48:10.509
I'll give up that is in that.

1099
01:48:11.609 --> 01:48:12.589
tape that you have got.

1100
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:14.620
This was written by Namadeva a long time back.

1101
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:17.819
So it has been sung often by women

1102
01:48:18.069 --> 01:48:19.259
and it sung

1103
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:22.060
asking for this yoga and

1104
01:48:22.549 --> 01:48:23.000
oh mother,

1105
01:48:23.069 --> 01:48:26.310
give us this yoga and please when will that come

1106
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:29.229
to get this yoga has been going on for ages,

1107
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.939
so.

1108
01:48:30.319 --> 01:48:35.109
It is not so creditable for those people because they have known about yoga,

1109
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:36.620
they have known about Kundalini.

1110
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:39.250
They have known what is this righteous life,

1111
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:40.259
what is the

1112
01:48:40.839 --> 01:48:41.700
higher life,

1113
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:43.060
what is the spiritual life,

1114
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.709
but it is very,

1115
01:48:43.819 --> 01:48:45.529
very creditable for you people

1116
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:47.100
that you have took to.

1117
01:48:47.509 --> 01:48:49.020
You have taken to saga.

1118
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:50.209
Not only that,

1119
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:53.020
but you have taken to all the songs and music,

1120
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:54.589
which are very fast numbers,

1121
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:55.459
I should say,

1122
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:56.790
of very different language,

1123
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:57.830
very different style.

1124
01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.419
It is all because your hearts are open

1125
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:03.569
and that you are people who are righteous.

1126
01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:06.669
You have been very righteous and virtuous people in your last life.

1127
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:07.319
Otherwise,

1128
01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:08.859
how could you have accepted

1129
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.669
this

1130
01:49:09.970 --> 01:49:10.740
sudden change,

1131
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:11.700
turnover,

1132
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:14.450
and enjoying that in such a

1133
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:16.819
way that we all are enjoying

1134
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:18.020
that beauty

1135
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:19.029
and that

1136
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:22.660
sweetness in all pure relationships with each other.

1137
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:23.629
It's so.

1138
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:26.819
Illuminating,

1139
01:49:27.490 --> 01:49:28.200
so

1140
01:49:28.529 --> 01:49:29.569
encouraging

1141
01:49:30.089 --> 01:49:31.680
that such things can happen.

1142
01:49:33.319 --> 01:49:35.580
I cannot believe sometimes myself

1143
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:38.459
that the jowa that was sung in the villages

1144
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:39.709
of Maharashtra

1145
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:44.620
are sung today by all of you here and understood what is a jog.

1146
01:49:45.919 --> 01:49:46.830
May God bless

1147
01:49:49.770 --> 01:49:51.959
My heart pours out with love,

1148
01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:52.729
blessings,

1149
01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:54.229
and whatever you want.

1150
01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.029
It pours out with that.

1151
01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:57.000
May God bless.

1152
01:50:05.729 --> 01:50:05.740
Very

1153
01:50:06.319 --> 01:50:06.720
well done,

1154
01:50:06.810 --> 01:50:07.439
I must say.

1155
01:50:09.439 --> 01:50:10.910
It's a very fast number.

1156
01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:18.359
Moreover,

1157
01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:21.220
villagers can sing it because they have no complications.

1158
01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.390
But for people living in the city in the west to sing this song is not easy.

1159
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.740
Mm

1160
01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.549
Now,

1161
01:50:31.839 --> 01:50:35.390
which other countries must endorse to some other countries like English?

1162
01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:40.290
One more you want to sing?

1163
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:40.930
All right.

1164
01:50:45.569 --> 01:50:45.580
Sure,

1165
01:50:46.359 --> 01:50:46.560
yes,

1166
01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:47.319
that's a good one.

1167
01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:49.970
That everybody can sing.

1168
01:50:50.379 --> 01:50:51.970
All of you should sing this song.

1169
01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.990
It's very sweet and simple.

1170
01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:01.450
Yeah yeah.

1171
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.640
I

1172
01:51:08.419 --> 01:51:08.430
But.

1173
01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:16.450
I play my that's got the pi pi or the words.

1174
01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:33.549
This time,

1175
01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:35.140
one day in Ganpati Pule,

1176
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:38.149
we'll have music by the Western musicians.

1177
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.919
I

1178
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:47.450
Like a river of Titania flowing.

1179
01:51:48.899 --> 01:51:50.569
Making all kinds of sounds

1180
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:51.669
bounding down.

1181
01:51:52.819 --> 01:51:54.290
Creating beauty all over.

1182
01:51:56.839 --> 01:51:59.790
It's so beautiful to see the whole world dancing like this.

1183
01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:02.359
You must pray tonight.

1184
01:52:03.549 --> 01:52:04.879
That many more

1185
01:52:05.959 --> 01:52:06.529

02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:15.549
Spirit

1382
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:17.189
merging into the skies.

1383
02:14:18.049 --> 02:14:18.310

1384
02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:21.240
OK that's

1385
02:14:22.359 --> 02:14:22.830
wonderful.

1386
02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:49.629
Mm

1387
02:14:58.959 --> 02:14:59.870

1388
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:01.479
the guinea.

1389
02:15:02.649 --> 02:15:05.000

1395
02:15:40.339 --> 02:15:40.350
Ma.

1396
02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:42.259
So how.

1397
02:15:45.259 --> 02:15:46.270
A touching.

1398
02:15:51.410 --> 02:15:51.419
I.

1399
02:15:53.549 --> 02:15:55.209

1400
02:15:57.009 --> 02:15:57.089
So.

1402
02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:05.060
It

1403
02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:10.589
It.

1404
02:16:13.819 --> 02:16:14.290
This is.

1405
02:16:21.779 --> 02:16:21.830
is

1406
02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:31.959
this morning.

1407

Mm.

And.

02:17:04.678 --> 02:17:06.689

02:17:24.628 --> 02:17:24.638
So.

1421
02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:35.419
My heart.

1422
02:17:40.428 --> 02:17:40.678
I guess.

1423
02:17:51.258 --> 02:17:51.329
Yeah

1424
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:52.120
He's coming from Algeria,

1425
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.509
is that it,

1426
02:18:52.570 --> 02:18:52.910
huh.

1427
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679
Oh,?

1428
02:18:59.468 --> 02:19:00.468
It's beautiful.

1429
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:01.509
It's so beautiful.

1430
02:19:02.019 --> 02:19:04.959
That's called the Sonora's voice was so deep.

1431
02:19:05.759 --> 02:19:07.558
It's beautiful.

1432
02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:07.759
Thanks so well.

1433
02:19:08.808 --> 02:19:09.589
He's from Vienna.

1434
02:19:10.369 --> 02:19:10.989
Uh,

1435
02:19:11.148 --> 02:19:12.958
his wife is Gennimata Gianni,

1436
02:19:13.189 --> 02:19:13.338
yeah,

1437
02:19:13.418 --> 02:19:13.999
he works in VR,

1438
02:19:14.227 --> 02:19:14.579
yes.

1439
02:19:19.490 --> 02:19:20.218
It's wonderful.

1440
02:19:21.829 --> 02:19:24.638
So we have all the countries represented.

1441
02:19:25.199 --> 02:19:26.659
Any other country which is left out,

1442
02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:27.699
wants to say Belgium,

1443
02:19:30.958 --> 02:19:31.598
one song.

1444
02:19:41.299 --> 02:19:41.638
Huh?

1445
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:44.218
Belgium and Holland together.

1446
02:19:44.429 --> 02:19:45.570
Germany or something?

1447
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:48.179
Austrians don't have anything new.

1448
02:19:48.959 --> 02:19:49.030
They

1449
02:20:17.629 --> 02:20:17.809
Mhm

1450
02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:23.570
She don't know what to put

1451
02:20:27.269 --> 02:20:27.620
Yeah

1452
02:20:29.509 --> 02:20:30.209
Where is Bahdan,

1453
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:31.290
he should sit with them.

1454
02:20:33.250 --> 02:20:34.879
It has become busy you know.

1455
02:20:38.959 --> 02:20:39.040
But

1456
02:20:40.509 --> 02:20:40.780
I

1457
02:24:34.549 --> 02:24:35.219
Wonderful,

1458
02:24:35.299 --> 02:24:35.889
beautiful.

1459
02:24:39.839 --> 02:24:41.469
So many from Belgium also.

1460
02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:43.250
And Holland

1461
02:24:44.330 --> 02:24:45.410
it's very encouraging.

1462
02:24:51.610 --> 02:24:52.969
Any other countries.

1463
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.759
H.

1464
02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:05.290
OK.

1465
02:25:30.059 --> 02:25:30.530
OK.

1466
02:25:41.929 --> 02:25:42.620
Of course I think.

1467
02:25:46.570 --> 02:25:46.669
Mhm

1468
02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:03.429
I get that.

1469
02:26:15.049 --> 02:26:15.400
A Deutsche.

1470
02:26:18.679 --> 02:26:20.299
I got to read this out

1471
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:21.400
so that

1472
02:26:21.730 --> 02:26:23.759
there won't be any problem and then you give it to me.

1473
02:26:28.990 --> 02:26:29.519
The first job

1474
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:32.030
And you all want channels,

1475
02:26:32.190 --> 02:26:33.120
or you come down.

1476
02:26:34.610 --> 02:26:36.009
Since we've only got one song,

1477
02:26:36.049 --> 02:26:38.769
we'll sing it both in German and English.

1478
02:26:41.650 --> 02:26:41.690
And the.

1479
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:45.650
I need to watch anything like that.

1480
02:26:48.719 --> 02:26:48.959
Ja I think like.

1481
02:26:53.700 --> 02:26:53.709
OK.

1482
02:28:00.009 --> 02:28:00.110
I

1483
02:28:18.049 --> 02:28:18.419
And

1484
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.480
Yeah.

1485
02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:31.009
Thank you

1486
02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:47.219
It's so well translated,

1487
02:32:47.269 --> 02:32:47.809
rhymed,

1488
02:32:47.820 --> 02:32:48.169
and

1489
02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:49.610
beautiful,

1490
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:50.379
very beautiful.

1491
02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:52.469
And extremely sweet,

1492
02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:55.139
especially to say this thing is.

1493
02:32:56.410 --> 02:32:58.290
She is for this purpose born,

1494
02:32:58.490 --> 02:33:00.530
lest all should be gone.

1495
02:33:01.240 --> 02:33:02.950
Inwardly confusion

1496
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:05.040
and devilish delusion,

1497
02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:06.959
this is to be seen

1498
02:33:07.269 --> 02:33:08.709
as something very great of you.

1499
02:33:09.620 --> 02:33:11.750
I wish you could see the rest of the Germans.

1500
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:15.519
I'm quite worried about them,

1501
02:33:16.129 --> 02:33:17.080
very much worried.

1502
02:33:17.530 --> 02:33:19.839
I'm happy that Sergio guys started

1503
02:33:20.410 --> 02:33:21.480
somehow in Munich,

1504
02:33:21.809 --> 02:33:23.120
and I'm going to go there.

1505
02:33:23.490 --> 02:33:25.080
I promised and I'll come.

1506
02:33:25.450 --> 02:33:26.040
May God bless.

1507
02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:41.120
Even before you invited me,

1508
02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:41.549
I,

1509
02:33:41.719 --> 02:33:43.759
I told them that I'm going to go to Munich,

1510
02:33:43.799 --> 02:33:44.589
whatever it is.

1511
02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:49.660
And also a little place where you were saying I have to go.

1512
02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:51.339
We'll see that

1513
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:54.639
May God this.

1514
02:34:01.209 --> 02:34:01.879
So now,

1515
02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:03.509
should we say goodnight,

1516
02:34:03.519 --> 02:34:03.589
so it should be the last one.

1517
02:34:18.629 --> 02:34:18.690
Is there any others?

1518
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.440
It's a country?

1519
02:34:20.459 --> 02:34:21.099
No,

1520
02:34:24.490 --> 02:34:24.500
nobody.

1521
02:34:24.509 --> 02:34:24.519
Yes.

1522
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:26.219
I just.

1523
02:34:29.639 --> 02:34:29.709
For

1524
02:34:31.070 --> 02:34:31.219
Yeah

1525
02:34:32.889 --> 02:34:33.549
So it's.

1526
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.190
the

1527
02:34:37.679 --> 02:34:37.690
Hm

1528
02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:41.429
it's.

1529
02:34:43.969 --> 02:34:44.990
Bulgarian song.

1530
02:35:50.139 --> 02:35:50.259
No.

1531
02:36:45.059 --> 02:36:46.030
Oh

1532
02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:48.900
Oh what a faith.

1533
02:37:10.299 --> 02:37:10.959
Oh

1534
02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:17.339
Our faith.

1535
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:47.209
I

1536
02:37:51.589 --> 02:37:51.599
No.

1537
02:37:58.320 --> 02:37:58.919
Tremendous

1538
02:38:13.629 --> 02:38:15.639
Tremendous and sung from the heart.

1539
02:38:16.559 --> 02:38:17.599
Very beautifully

1540
02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:19.750
we have great artists among us.

1541
02:38:21.299 --> 02:38:22.629
I can see that.

1542
02:38:23.099 --> 02:38:23.820
May God bless you.

1543
02:38:24.769 --> 02:38:25.480
May God.

1544
02:38:26.059 --> 02:38:26.719
It's beautiful.

1545
02:38:28.349 --> 02:38:29.900
Beautifully from the heart.

1546
02:38:33.959 --> 02:38:36.009
Germans are known for music

1547
02:38:36.450 --> 02:38:37.580
and very good singing,

1548
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:38.200
you see.

1549
02:38:38.530 --> 02:38:40.849
They created beautiful music once upon a time.

1550
02:38:41.969 --> 02:38:44.339
Now the time has come for Germans to create.

1551
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:47.019
More music.

1552
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:49.549
Same about Italians.

1553
02:38:51.089 --> 02:38:51.620
And

1554
02:38:52.969 --> 02:38:54.400
So many other

1555
02:38:54.769 --> 02:38:56.490
great musicians in this country.

1556
02:38:58.549 --> 02:38:59.870
They are reborn in you,

1557
02:38:59.910 --> 02:39:01.059
and you have to produce.

1558
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:03.299
Better music

1559
02:39:03.509 --> 02:39:04.740
than what they had done.

1560
02:39:07.589 --> 02:39:08.480
May God bless you all.

1561
02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:27.910
All this music should go with me,

1562
02:39:27.919 --> 02:39:28.269
I think.

1563
02:39:29.679 --> 02:39:30.219
Good idea.

1564
02:39:36.719 --> 02:39:37.719
This one I have,

1565
02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:39.009
this one I don't have.

1566
02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:40.870
This one is

1567
02:39:44.469 --> 02:39:46.030
This belongs to I think Jose or something.

1568
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:48.950
Thank you very much.

1569
02:39:50.259 --> 02:39:50.929
Tomorrow

1570
02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:54.330
What time the English have to go?

1571
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000
Yeah,

1572
02:39:59.429 --> 02:40:00.540
not later than 2,

1573
02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:02.950
so we must start our food about 10 o'clock.
