SHRI KRISHNA PUJA PRIVATE
Cabella Ligure

00:00:02.462 --> 00:00:08.809
Today we are going to worship Radha and Krishna.

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:16.906
It's a very festive feeling

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:23.090
because Shri Krishna came on this earth

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:30.775
at a time when people had become

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:42.013
had become extremely serious about religion, about spirituality, and

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:54.188
that  made the whole aspect of religion as a joyless achievement.

00:00:55.998 --> 00:01:04.097
And that's how people became very serious;

00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:11.756
also the attention of people was diverted

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:20.280
into a kind of a drama, which created aloofness from the society.

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:31.395
People became individualistic, secretive

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:37.483
and all such people's children also became the same style

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:48.862
because a kind of a fear, perhaps,

00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:58.679
developed among the people who were in pursuit of religion and truth.

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:15.753
Now the family does make a difference

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:22.277
and has a big influence on the personality of the people.

00:02:22.873 --> 00:02:29.148
So they got it from their parents

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.829
and then their grandchildren also got the same type of a feeling.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.302
So, for 2,000 years after Shri Rama went away,

00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:52.631
the whole situation became a very separate pursuit,

00:02:53.792 --> 00:02:59.317
and they would not tell each other what they have found.

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:04.686
They did not tell even their parents

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:07.231
what they are seeking - what they wanted.

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:10.958
In this secretiveness they got lost

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:15.704
and that's how there were lots of false gurus

00:03:15.784 --> 00:03:21.727
and false type of paths, were discovered.

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:27.163
Still it was not so bad, but this aloofness

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:31.512
made the society look so disintegrated.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.024
The collectivity was thus - even in the family it was not there.

00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:43.568
The father wouldn't talk to the son, he wouldn't talk to his wife or

00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:47.398
maybe the wife may not talk to her children.

00:03:47.787 --> 00:03:51.854
They religiously followed - in India especially

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:54.594
- followed the dharma part.

00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:58.820
But they went to the right side - I would say.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.471
In such an austere manner they followed

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:09.750
Gita without seeing through the lines what was written there.

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:15.528
As I've told you many a times - that when he talked of Karma Yoga -

00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:21.446
he said that action should become non-action -  Akarma.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:28.650
How, he said, put everything at the Lotus Feet of Shri Krishna,

00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:31.656
But that never happened.

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:35.029
You see because, unless and until you get your self-realization,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.780
you always think you're doing something, like that,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.155
you're achieving something and when you start doing

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:52.893
then you also start sometimes overpowering others, dominating others.

00:04:53.718 --> 00:04:59.298
And there is another group that starts thinking that,

00:04:59.497 --> 00:05:05.777
I'm being aggressed, I'm so much in pain, in trouble.

00:05:06.102 --> 00:05:10.643
So there, two types of people developed - one aggressive type

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:18.227
and another were the people who were absolutely crying and weeping.

00:05:19.092 --> 00:05:23.331
In those days, of course after Krishna -

00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:26.800
before Krishna came - all these things were such.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:33.898
So, Krishna started talking about

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:39.805
the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:44.153
He said that a Sahaja Yogi is a balanced person.

00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:48.777
For him, happiness and unhappiness has no meaning -

00:05:49.034 --> 00:05:54.141
whatever he does he feels it's all done by God Almighty -

00:05:54.258 --> 00:05:57.043
but you have to be a Sahaja Yogi to be that way.

00:05:57.193 --> 00:06:01.476
Though he described a Sahaja Yogi, there were no Sahaja Yogis at that time.

00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:03.984
Mostly people were extremely austere,

00:06:04.093 --> 00:06:08.155
they went to Himalayas and all the places for seeking truth -

00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:12.082
what Gita had told, they followed it.

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.894
So, another thing started was a bhakti cult.

00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:22.772
In the bhakti cult, I mean when they moved in a collective,

00:06:23.106 --> 00:06:27.960
see they thought we should have a bhakti of Shri Rama.

00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:32.143
And in that bhakti also, they were secretive,

00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:36.337
they wouldn't tell anybody what they were doing and what was it.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:40.334
But, Shri Krishna came and he talked about bhakti,

00:06:40.437 --> 00:06:44.789
that - he said that - you have to have bhakti

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:50.829
when it is absolutely surrendered to God.

00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:55.557
Ananya, means that "you are not the other"

00:06:55.752 --> 00:07:01.141
- you become one - and this is what people missed,

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.201
because they thought Ananya means

00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:10.601
complete, full, from the heart - it was not so.

00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:16.363
So, Shri Krishna was also misunderstood by these people

00:07:16.482 --> 00:07:21.352
and they went to another extreme with this Ananya Bhakti.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.638
You know now a big wave started in Bengal only

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:29.916
and people used to run on the street -

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:34.509
Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, and used to do all kinds of things all over

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.823
without understanding what he said about bhakti -

00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:41.744
how to have bhakti without connection -

00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:45.082
there is no bhakti according to him.

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:49.494
So, some people got lost into that kind of a bhakti,

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:57.805
which was not at all meant for your ascent,  for your evolution.

00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:02.882
But with that, you see also, so many saints who came;

00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:07.331
they didn't know what to tell people about because they couldn't give them realization.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:09.335
So, they said you should remember God.

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:13.637
You should remember the name of Shri Ram, Shri Krishna and all that.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:17.237
Especially in Maharashtra there were many saints who said that -

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:20.011
they try to remember the name of God.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:25.260
But it didn't mean, just remember means, just all the time to say - Oh,

00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:29.201
do whatever you like and say "I remember God."

00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:32.951
So, you see, they also have failed that way - I should say.

00:08:33.093 --> 00:08:38.910
Because they never understood what sort of human beings they were facing.

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:44.783
Also, the saints became very

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:49.349
intimidated by other priests and other people.

00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:53.235
So, in that, we have two types of saints

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.551
where we have people who are talking of

00:08:57.749 --> 00:09:02.442
"Birahar" means,  separation from God.

00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:06.402
Even, Ravindranath was like that to begin with.

00:09:06.537 --> 00:09:12.835
And then they start talking about the meeting of God.

00:09:13.105 --> 00:09:18.560
So, another type of saints were the real saints who talked about it,

00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:25.768
but very few people really showed any interest in becoming that.

00:09:25.927 --> 00:09:29.691
They would say, we have regard for this, we respect this,

00:09:29.826 --> 00:09:33.227
we believe in this, we believe in Shri Krishna.

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:37.337
They used to go to a place called Pandapur in Maharashtra.

00:09:37.448 --> 00:09:43.316
Everywhere you go you will find Shri Krishna's thing all over the country.

00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:47.464
Especially in Gujarat, because Shri Krishna ruled there,

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:51.868
so they are all believers of Shri Krishna.

00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:57.809
What he came for was forgotten.

00:09:58.153 --> 00:10:04.047
He was talking about realization, he was talking about connection.

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:11.068
So in all these preachings they could not read between the lines

00:10:11.314 --> 00:10:14.501
and they started doing on their own.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:21.850
In our history, we have horrible things done in the name of Shri Krishna.

00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:27.318
Not only Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, but have a temple of Shri Nath -

00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:34.912
and that temple was created for a deity which  was very vibrated,

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:38.948
was the deity of Shri Krishna,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.072
when he ran away from the field of battle - Ranchordas.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:47.951
Now, when he ran away from the field of battle it was because

00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:53.623
he wanted to deceive one monster and to get him killed.

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:58.141
So, this Ranchordas state was very important  because

00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:02.472
how he tricked this horrible monster and how he managed

00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:07.371
to take him to a cave where a saint was

00:11:07.578 --> 00:11:12.965
sleeping and who was given a sort of a boon -

00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:15.869
that anybody who tries to wake you up,

00:11:15.989 --> 00:11:18.774
you can open your third eye and kill him.

00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:21.198
So, Shri Krishna played a trick,

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.015
he ran into his cave and this monster also ran after him,

00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:29.102
running away from the battle field,

00:11:29.236 --> 00:11:36.213
and he put his shawl on top of this

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.779
saint who was sleeping -

00:11:39.012 --> 00:11:42.562
so the monster came behind him,

00:11:42.737 --> 00:11:47.059
he said "so now, you are tired from running and sleeping here

00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:48.626
and he pulled the shawl,

00:11:48.737 --> 00:11:56.608
and as soon as he pulled the shawl this saint got up and he burnt him.

00:11:56.749 --> 00:12:02.122
And that's how he killed this rakshasha, the devil.

00:12:09.016 --> 00:12:15.556
So, the life style of Shri Krishna was very different from that of Rama.

00:12:16.062 --> 00:12:22.437
Rama was the one who accepted everything,
he went into exile

00:12:22.628 --> 00:12:27.292
and he also spent 14 years,

00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:31.192
then he went out in search of his wife

00:12:31.295 --> 00:12:39.294
and also his children did not accept him much.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:47.384
Now, the aspect of Shri Krishna's life was very different.

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:50.958
First thing, he came to know about human beings

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:53.846
that they are very cunning people

00:12:54.037 --> 00:12:56.886
and if you tell them about God or anything,

00:12:57.001 --> 00:12:58.889
they will never accept.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.250
They will do the way they think about it.

00:13:02.393 --> 00:13:05.594
So he said, let us try the other way round.

00:13:05.757 --> 00:13:08.514
So, he played a trick with his preaching -

00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:12.014
that you have to do your Karmas

00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:16.543
or your actions - which become non-actions -
which is an impossible situation -

00:13:16.607 --> 00:13:22.787
and the second one that your devotion should be

00:13:23.086 --> 00:13:25.894
Ananya - when you are connected.

00:13:26.195 --> 00:13:29.743
Now, these two conditions, nobody could fulfill, he knew.

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:34.427
So, they will go on working on this and at the time of Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:37.942
they'll come around knowing that  they have not achieved anything

00:13:38.035 --> 00:13:43.291
by practicing all those things, whatever Shri Krishna has said.

00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:47.003
But his life style was different.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:52.844
When he came as a little boy,

00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:56.830
he first tried to kill all the monsters

00:13:56.896 --> 00:14:02.708
who were invading Gokul, the place where he was living.

00:14:02.994 --> 00:14:07.000
In a different, different manner he killed

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.292
Putana, who was a horrible woman,

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:14.577
she was a rakshashi, whom he killed just

00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:16.646
by sucking her breast because

00:14:16.708 --> 00:14:21.540
she wanted to poison him with her poison

00:14:21.676 --> 00:14:23.448
and that's how he did it.

00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:26.776
So this shows you see, that the first thing

00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:30.168
he took to was extreme aggressiveness

00:14:30.311 --> 00:14:33.464
against all the negative forces that were working,

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:35.397
which Rama did not do.

00:14:35.477 --> 00:14:39.389
Rama succumbed to everything,
whatever was happening to begin with,

00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:41.855
later on then he killed Ravanna.

00:14:41.903 --> 00:14:45.143
But as a child, he was a sweet little child,

00:14:45.147 --> 00:14:47.963
and lots of descriptions are there about him.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.573
So, from very childhood, the attitude of Shri Krishna

00:14:51.637 --> 00:14:56.557
was more action as far as the negativity was concerned

00:14:56.656 --> 00:15:00.417
and he killed many rakshashas until he killed Kamsa.

00:15:00.548 --> 00:15:03.484
So, the first part was killing these people.

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:05.696
Because they were very aggressive

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.690
and they were sucking the energy of the people

00:15:08.864 --> 00:15:15.204
and they were also becoming like a megalomaniac, as you call that,

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:17.312
they used to think no end of themselves,

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:20.122
so there, you see, he killed their ego,

00:15:20.224 --> 00:15:22.203
he killed them, so many of them,

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:28.551
and then he helped the Pandavas to establish the truth.

00:15:28.758 --> 00:15:32.506
To help the people who are truthful, who are for truth,

00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:35.513
but he could not give them realization,

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:37.437
he didn't give them realization.

00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:42.928
Up to a point he brought them to understand that always the truth wins.

00:15:43.137 --> 00:15:46.938
They call it "Satyamewajyati" - the truth wins.

00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:51.545
This happened at the time when it was

00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:58.440
very important to show that those negative forces cannot overpower.

00:15:58.544 --> 00:16:00.804
To show how useless they were,

00:16:00.932 --> 00:16:04.409
to show how they had been active

00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:07.944
and have been dominating and everybody had fear

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:10.935
but all of them were neutralized by him.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.887
That he can kill all these negative forces.

00:16:16.178 --> 00:16:20.968
This is one of his styles which is very important for modern times.

00:16:21.135 --> 00:16:26.042
Now, in America, as you see,
there are so many negative forces that have come up.

00:16:26.216 --> 00:16:29.476
They are in a different form, they are not like monsters.

00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:34.720
But they are by temperament, are monsters.

00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:40.599
The collectivity that he preached through Rasadena and all that,

00:16:40.723 --> 00:16:45.226
that he brought in his, I should say adolescent

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:49.522
age, was also remarkable. That he made people dance together,

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:55.313
pray together, to be festive and to know that you are a witness,

00:16:55.401 --> 00:17:01.002
you are not a slave of religion or of your meditation,

00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:03.214
but you have to be festive.

00:17:03.302 --> 00:17:08.280
And he got this introduction of Holi festivals

00:17:08.388 --> 00:17:11.046
and many others, like Rakhibandhan,

00:17:11.102 --> 00:17:14.982
all these he brought in because he thought this is how

00:17:15.045 --> 00:17:20.865
the society will be cleansed and
also they will have a lot of enjoyment.

00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:24.934
So the idea of enjoyment he brought it into the lives of people.

00:17:25.022 --> 00:17:30.398
In the little childish pranks he used to play on people

00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:36.667
just to teach them and make them turn to something

00:17:36.743 --> 00:17:39.154
that was a very great enjoyment.

00:17:39.348 --> 00:17:43.270
Now, his enjoyment was enjoyment of the spirit,

00:17:43.334 --> 00:17:46.794
the enjoyment, pure enjoyment.

00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:50.421
You see all these things reflected in the American life today -

00:17:50.517 --> 00:17:52.651
but in a perverted way.

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:55.815
Now, the sense of enjoyment in American life

00:17:55.895 --> 00:17:59.984
is absolutely perverted, because it is self-destructive.

00:18:00.429 --> 00:18:03.420
Whatever they take to is self-destructive.

00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:06.071
You tell them anything they`ll say "what's wrong".

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.203
Why all these gurus prospered there because

00:18:10.362 --> 00:18:14.778
they pampered the ego of Americans and said "it's alright,

00:18:14.882 --> 00:18:19.005
you can do whatever you like, as long as you give us money".

00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:20.932
And this suited them very well

00:18:21.028 --> 00:18:23.376
and they started doing all these things

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.849
of a sort of - in a way going into perversion.

00:18:28.936 --> 00:18:30.659
Like Rajaneesh now.

00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:34.268
Rajaneesh came to America and how people liked him.

00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:37.090
He had a Rajaneesh “Hindi word” this, that

00:18:37.154 --> 00:18:41.940
and he established there thousands and thousands of people.

00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:45.566
But then again Shri Krishna's power worked on him

00:18:45.639 --> 00:18:47.682
and he was defeated then.

00:18:47.762 --> 00:18:51.866
Everywhere you find there are so many gurus like that.

00:18:52.018 --> 00:18:55.663
They all were defeated, really, by Shri Krishna's power,

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.367
because he has all the tricks of the trade.

00:18:58.431 --> 00:19:01.607
He knows how to make a fool out of them.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.509
Just imagine, this Rajaneesh was so powerful

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:07.064
and an idea came into his head that he can

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.347
become the lord of that place - or whatever it is, and they conspired,

00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:14.081
but its over - it's finished.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:17.774
One must know also how much also we have achieved.

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:23.438
Then there was another one, Muktananda,
and this 16-year-old fellow - so many of them.

00:19:23.597 --> 00:19:26.483
One by one all of them are finished,

00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:30.858
I would say that it is Shri Krishna's power that has worked.

00:19:31.134 --> 00:19:35.414
Because his lifestyle was, from the very beginning like that was,

00:19:35.498 --> 00:19:40.551
that to kill all those who were negative.

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:50.786
Now, if you see in America, I think, except for one or two leftovers,

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:52.998
most of them are finished.

00:19:53.078 --> 00:19:56.133
Now, there is one more who will be finished also I'm sure,

00:19:56.193 --> 00:20:01.360
within no time, and we will see that the influence of these

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.864
people, negative people, will be finished.

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:10.140
As a result of that, as a result of all that,

00:20:10.204 --> 00:20:13.756
what has happened that people have lost faith in anyone.

00:20:13.858 --> 00:20:18.774
They have no faith in anyone. They think if these people

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.972
could deceive us like that, take away our money,

00:20:22.036 --> 00:20:26.360
we have no money even to educate our children,
we have sold our houses,

00:20:26.498 --> 00:20:32.959
so all these things, you see, made them absolutely flabbergasted

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:39.351
and they decided not to have anything to do with the gurus
who are coming from India -

00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:42.586
and that was against us, in a way.

00:20:43.277 --> 00:20:48.749
But all of them, you see, what they did, we should find out, is that,

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:55.110
to make a very absurd, queer type of organization.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.358
We are not, we are very normal, absolutely normal people.

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:06.492
We haven't made any absurd type of religion or absurd type of following

00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:12.409
or absurd type of meditation like you fly in the air and all sorts of things.

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:23.638
But the people of America are not so matured  to understand  that,

00:21:23.765 --> 00:21:27.839
otherwise they would not have fallen to these horrible gurus.

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:32.749
So, on one side we have people who are very much affected by these gurus,

00:21:32.813 --> 00:21:37.699
on the other side we have people  who think that also I must be one of them

00:21:37.787 --> 00:21:44.268
and on the third aspect is this,  that the people are extremely simple,

00:21:44.355 --> 00:21:49.090
and extremely, I should say immature -

00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:52.188
they are like children.

00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:55.482
So many Americans also told me they are like children

00:21:55.617 --> 00:21:59.157
and to approach them you have to say that

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:03.281
a Mother's love can only put them right.

00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:09.837
Now, as far as I'm concerned, that was the first country,
I should say, I visited for any programme.

00:22:10.082 --> 00:22:14.769
In 1971, I went there.

00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:20.613
So you can imagine, we got realization on
this Sahasrara Day in 1970  and went

00:22:20.788 --> 00:22:27.689
to America in 1971 and I gave realization to people -
no doubt, to many -

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:37.086
but what I felt was, that they didn't care for deeper things, firstly.

00:22:37.623 --> 00:22:41.281
So we lost many Sahaja Yogis like that.

00:22:41.496 --> 00:22:49.779
Then there were some people who were sick
they wanted their treatment that's all - nothing more.

00:22:50.223 --> 00:22:56.121
Then came some people who were taken away, I should say,

00:22:56.225 --> 00:23:02.201
by other bombastic gurus

00:23:02.239 --> 00:23:07.001
who told them lots of stories and they claimed
so much, so, so many joined them.

00:23:07.215 --> 00:23:13.604
Like that it was, I found that the people were
absolutely not prepared for Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:13.866 --> 00:23:17.236
They were seekers, no doubt, no doubt they were seekers,

00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:20.644
and they had that restlessness of a seeker, no doubt.

00:23:20.715 --> 00:23:26.712
But they were not for Sahaja Yoga -
they didn't know what to seek, what to get.

00:23:26.807 --> 00:23:30.162
That was the part where I felt they were very immature.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:34.871
So I, after that I didn't go for 9 years,

00:23:35.093 --> 00:23:38.288
because I thought, better to devote your time to something else

00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:44.714
till these people mature and understand what's wrong with them.

00:23:44.817 --> 00:23:50.460
Now, they had been to gurus and they were lost,
there are some who have this restlessness still.

00:23:50.698 --> 00:23:56.888
I see in many things, the articles they write,
something the books they write,

00:23:56.958 --> 00:24:02.725
that there is this kind of a restlessness - which is very important for Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:06.557
Most of you have been seekers in your last lives

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:11.316
and you had this restlessness within you.

00:24:11.729 --> 00:24:16.620
But with this restlessness we didn't know what to do,  where to go

00:24:16.692 --> 00:24:21.399
and with that restlessness some people went even up to Japan,

00:24:21.462 --> 00:24:25.497
some Australians came up to America, and all kinds of things happened.

00:24:25.526 --> 00:24:30.106
That restlessness you cannot describe,

00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:38.516
but these gurus found a good market so
they came down and tried to overpower them.

00:24:40.174 --> 00:24:48.776
With this restlessness you see, it was very reasonable, logical,

00:24:48.886 --> 00:24:52.090
to see that if you go to somebody -

00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:57.668
Do you get rid of your restlessness or not? -
minimum of minimum - but that never happened.

00:24:57.724 --> 00:25:02.155
So when it never happened, you see, they thought that

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:06.176
this is missing, somebody said, "no you have to have another programme or

00:25:06.224 --> 00:25:09.498
you have to go to another course" - this, that.

00:25:09.578 --> 00:25:15.149
So they went on falling more and more and more.

00:25:15.543 --> 00:25:21.438
At the same time, at the same time, negativity of immorality took place.

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:26.506
Though if you read the constitution of America you will be amazed.

00:25:26.618 --> 00:25:32.242
In very subtle ways it has just supported complete morality.

00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:37.630
I mean, I was surprised, there's a law that when you go out of the house

00:25:37.725 --> 00:25:46.328
you cannot wear funny dresses,
when you are in a swimming suit - also  that is regulated,

00:25:46.423 --> 00:25:49.349
and nobody can be absolutely nude -

00:25:49.412 --> 00:25:53.428
like in Italy, you can find on television

00:25:53.912 --> 00:25:59.429
So, you see, the constitution was made with a great idea of morality -

00:25:59.578 --> 00:26:04.785
I mean the whole basis was, people have to become moral.

00:26:04.889 --> 00:26:09.377
But always if you make any law, human beings have a capacity

00:26:09.473 --> 00:26:15.794
just to sort of blast it - to survive - this law.
I don't want anything

00:26:15.929 --> 00:26:21.590
- and that's how the idea of control started. How can you control it ?

00:26:21.865 --> 00:26:25.066
How can you say one should not do like this?

00:26:25.224 --> 00:26:29.930
Now, this explosion started in the family also

00:26:30.001 --> 00:26:34.944
and the children started disobeying the parents.
The parents themselves were of the same style.

00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:40.608
Then the children become the same style, now the whole thing started exploding

00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:43.977
and they thought - there's no freedom.

00:26:44.081 --> 00:26:48.934
Those who don't know how to use freedom - should not get any freedom - I think.

00:26:49.179 --> 00:26:55.599
They must know what is freedom is, those who respect freedom
and understand freedom can only be free people.

00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:59.169
So in that freedom, with this explosion, they were thrown away

00:26:59.252 --> 00:27:05.325
and they started taking to lives which were really absolutely absurd,

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:10.107
calling it most reasonable, most logical.

00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:18.021
So, the people became homosexuals - it's absurd,

00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:21.739
it's not natural at all, it is absolutely absurd.

00:27:22.247 --> 00:27:26.714
But when this idea of freedom exploded in them,

00:27:26.817 --> 00:27:30.254
then all the bhoots came and took over their freedom

00:27:30.762 --> 00:27:33.507
and its from the bhoots they got these ideas,

00:27:33.692 --> 00:27:37.297
and in such a large scale they are taking to this -

00:27:37.352 --> 00:27:40.307
it's very surprising, such a large scale.

00:27:40.343 --> 00:27:44.016
These bhoots are affecting, and people are getting into it.

00:27:44.072 --> 00:27:48.923
As a result of that they started getting all these diseases and all.

00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:52.367
The worst was, I would say, that at that same moment,

00:27:52.446 --> 00:27:57.491
the most negative personality came from Austria - was Freud.

00:27:57.793 --> 00:28:03.689
He was a Jew and he was not respected
by the people of America at that time.

00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:07.463
So he got hold of lots of Jews and all that

00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:12.300
and then he made up this story about the mother and all that

00:28:12.348 --> 00:28:15.678
and he's the one who ruined their lives,

00:28:15.772 --> 00:28:18.770
because as soon as they became free

00:28:18.842 --> 00:28:23.762
they thought, anybody who writes anything black and white is the bible.

00:28:23.873 --> 00:28:28.873
They started following this fellow and some others also from France

00:28:28.952 --> 00:28:34.960
and just it's a sign of complete immaturity -

00:28:35.108 --> 00:28:39.022
a mature person won't take to this or won't take to that.

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:42.286
I've talked to some Americans, at that time,

00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:46.702
and I mean they were not Sahaja Yogis, not seekers, I think.

00:28:46.773 --> 00:28:49.984
They said "we enjoy every part of life,

00:28:50.067 --> 00:28:55.934
you see we never have any problems -
we enjoy everything, we do this, we do that.

00:28:56.069 --> 00:29:02.640
The enjoyment is important,
100% of our life is full of enjoyment".

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:05.190
Now, after that phase -

00:29:05.258 --> 00:29:13.397
I think this was so when they came to India
about 1960's or 50's, they were talking like that.

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:19.840
Now, they are talking about all the problems
they are facing out of these enjoyments.

00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:25.830
They say that 65% people might become schizophrenic,

00:29:25.925 --> 00:29:30.596
30% will become lunatic.

00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:37.859
Means who are left, no more then, I can't understand.
All kinds of statistics you see - you are shocked.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:44.604
How could such a big number of human beings get into trouble of this kind

00:29:44.768 --> 00:29:50.172
and the diseases they have is also very funny,

00:29:50.286 --> 00:29:54.074
that they have most of the diseases of Mooladhara,

00:29:54.229 --> 00:29:58.073
where the constitution is based on Mooladhara.

00:29:58.168 --> 00:30:02.668
England has no constitution, no constitution at all,

00:30:02.728 --> 00:30:09.226
but they believe more in Mooladhara than the people in America.

00:30:09.342 --> 00:30:14.583
So, there, because when I was

00:30:14.766 --> 00:30:19.071
like, you see, a wife of a diplomat and all that,

00:30:19.128 --> 00:30:26.128
I found such a wretched temperament these

00:30:26.436 --> 00:30:29.856
ambassadors and all these diplomatic people had.

00:30:29.913 --> 00:30:33.689
I couldn't believe, how could they be at the helm of affairs

00:30:33.776 --> 00:30:35.977
and from America, especially you know,

00:30:36.112 --> 00:30:44.364
they would wink at every women and they would twitch on their faces

00:30:44.484 --> 00:30:48.985
and the way they would talk about women was so degrading

00:30:49.073 --> 00:30:54.526
so demeaning and also women would talk about men.

00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:59.174
I told ou the story of the one who came to England
and she wanted to see a pub

00:30:59.254 --> 00:31:04.171
and she told me, "Have you visited this particular pub?"
I said, for what?

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.886
And then her two sons, when she went back,

00:31:08.997 --> 00:31:14.522
she told, "we are very free, we have given all freedom
to the children -do what you like".

00:31:14.824 --> 00:31:20.682
And they were celebrating, these two children, were celebrating their birthday

00:31:20.831 --> 00:31:24.455
and they had a party with lots of drinks

00:31:24.566 --> 00:31:30.769
and the whole house got burnt,
the children were dead  and the parents were dead -

00:31:31.166 --> 00:31:39.222
She went to see the pub and she had a list of
the interesting pubs that there are in England.

00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:44.632
I mean this interest in the pub itself shows

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:50.099
what sort of a personality she was.
She had two children, she had a husband -

00:31:50.146 --> 00:31:55.240
her husband was a very big man of a very high
repute and all that - and his wife was like that.

00:31:55.319 --> 00:32:00.303
He also used to join her - yes, we gave all freedom to our children,

00:32:00.378 --> 00:32:04.196
we asked them to do what they like, but they must enjoy life.

00:32:04.308 --> 00:32:09.685
Now enjoyment at what point? Where do you enjoy?

00:32:09.883 --> 00:32:14.403
You can enjoy in your heart, you can enjoy in your Sahasrara,

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.876
but with Mooladhara there's no question,

00:32:17.956 --> 00:32:21.260
because if you go on like this there is no end to it

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:26.494
and that has created now tremendous problems in America.

00:32:26.923 --> 00:32:31.454
I know, I feel very sorry, that was the first country I went to

00:32:31.638 --> 00:32:35.340
because I could see that there are lots of seekers,

00:32:35.547 --> 00:32:41.835
but all of them were not there,
some had gone to this guru, some had gone to that guru.

00:32:42.018 --> 00:32:46.477
And there was one lady, after she came to my programme,

00:32:46.668 --> 00:32:49.768
and she noted down what I was saying

00:32:49.864 --> 00:32:55.948
and she used it for her own purpose and she started teaching Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:57.225 --> 00:33:02.676
Its beyond me, how they are also very money oriented.

00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:07.374
To them, money is success, money is joy, money is everything.

00:33:07.493 --> 00:33:11.887
Now, this third quality, from where did it come I can't say

00:33:12.078 --> 00:33:16.905
but at the time of Shri Krishna, people were very money oriented.

00:33:17.635 --> 00:33:21.476
In the sense that they used to take their milk to sell,

00:33:21.587 --> 00:33:30.212
milk and butter and everything,
to sell in the Kingdom of Kamsa, who was a devil.

00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:34.466
So he used to break their pitchers, so that they need not pay.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.931
But just to make money they would starve their children,

00:33:38.018 --> 00:33:44.218
but to make money, they used to take this to the monsters

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:50.266
because he had lots of armies and things and they needed milk.

00:33:50.449 --> 00:33:53.572
So these women would not give milk to their own children,

00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:58.783
would not give them butter,
but would take all that for these horrible people.

00:33:59.243 --> 00:34:02.457
So that money orientation you see now -

00:34:02.568 --> 00:34:08.453
I mean it is like a shadow and a light.

00:34:08.603 --> 00:34:13.005
If light is Shri Krishna, see what you find in the shadow.

00:34:13.114 --> 00:34:16.788
It's just the other way around, people behave.

00:34:17.249 --> 00:34:20.965
He was such a detached person, such a detached person,

00:34:21.299 --> 00:34:29.586
that he can never commit any wrongs, he could not do any immoral things.

00:34:29.952 --> 00:34:33.852
Whatever he did was absolutely moral.

00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:40.519
Because if you are detached and
you are doing something, then nothing touches you.

00:34:42.296 --> 00:34:50.100
He brought in this idea of Leela, of this play, the play of the Divine.

00:34:50.824 --> 00:34:55.433
Now we see in our lives also how the play of Divine works.

00:34:55.648 --> 00:34:59.157
The Sahaja Yogis first when they come they are really restless

00:34:59.253 --> 00:35:03.235
and they go on asking me a hundred questions or

00:35:03.317 --> 00:35:07.168
they start also dominating others, doing all kinds of things.

00:35:07.304 --> 00:35:11.702
But once they get the experience of the Divine power

00:35:11.893 --> 00:35:14.263
then they start settling down.

00:35:14.414 --> 00:35:20.483
Now then they see that there are so many coincidences that happen,

00:35:20.642 --> 00:35:25.344
so many miracles that happen, then they start understanding

00:35:25.503 --> 00:35:29.700
that there is some power which is looking after us,

00:35:29.803 --> 00:35:33.710
which is guiding us, which is taking us to the right path.

00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:40.024
So, unless and until this happens,
that this understanding, even before realization,

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:46.024
if people start getting this realization
that there is a power that is helping us,

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:51.235
something beyond what we know, then things will start changing.

00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:56.711
Now, we have to work out in America, we have to tell them,

00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:59.968
and we have to tell that, this is the power

00:36:00.087 --> 00:36:05.435
that is beyond, is wanting to transform you.

00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:08.994
There is going to be a global transformation,

00:36:09.096 --> 00:36:14.317
I can see it so clearly now, in every country I go I see this,

00:36:14.692 --> 00:36:20.712
that it works, it works - whether it is a Turkish country,

00:36:20.784 --> 00:36:26.599
or it is Tunisia or if it is Russia - any country I go to,

00:36:26.742 --> 00:36:29.858
all those people who come, it works,

00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:35.196
this global transformation - I never thought I would be able to see it in my lifetime.

00:36:35.307 --> 00:36:40.799
But it has really reached it's highest,

00:36:41.077 --> 00:36:46.770
I would say I think so, is the highest point of development.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.754
So you are all transformed,

00:36:51.968 --> 00:36:54.504
this was predicted,

00:36:54.647 --> 00:37:00.081
a long time back in India, and also I must say,
it must have been predicted somewhere else also.

00:37:00.213 --> 00:37:05.895
Now when you start feeling the vibrations and you start using it,

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:10.196
then you understand that there is this power that works,

00:37:10.488 --> 00:37:16.105
now then you start seeing energy centres of Swayambu's and all that -

00:37:16.209 --> 00:37:18.804
then you start understanding this.

00:37:18.955 --> 00:37:22.088
It goes on, your understanding increasing

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:28.227
but first thing is that they have to believe that there is a power beyond.

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:30.954
They may not believe in Kundalini, it doesn't matter,

00:37:31.114 --> 00:37:36.191
but once you know that there is a power beyond then they'll try to work it out.

00:37:36.402 --> 00:37:42.582
And this is what is very very difficult to convince people, that there is a power behind.

00:37:42.709 --> 00:37:48.783
Because they are so conditioned by Science, also by their family traditions,

00:37:48.959 --> 00:37:56.026
also all nonsensical ideas about ego, that they cannot see,

00:37:56.209 --> 00:38:00.094
that's the point is, that the nature is helping.

00:38:00.205 --> 00:38:04.419
Now, why America is such a rich country, why?

00:38:04.523 --> 00:38:06.937
They never ask such a question - Why is it so rich?

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.901
What have they done? What are their punyas?

00:38:10.013 --> 00:38:14.036
Now, one of the reasons is that Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:19.419
He's doing his job, I should say,

00:38:19.618 --> 00:38:24.391
he's working it out. But people not understanding that

00:38:24.533 --> 00:38:29.881
this is a Divine blessing they think that this is their right to have it and

00:38:30.029 --> 00:38:33.495
they boast about it, they are very boastful people,

00:38:33.654 --> 00:38:37.397
they talk about their own wealth, they'll talk about everything,

00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:43.325
it's a very different situation and a culture.

00:38:45.111 --> 00:38:47.906
For an Indian, if somebody starts boasting about

00:38:48.008 --> 00:38:53.571
his wealth, they would think
he must be mad and coming from a lunatic asylum

00:38:53.873 --> 00:38:56.729
because it is regarded as bad manners.

00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:59.713
So there is nothing like bad manners, you see,

00:38:59.776 --> 00:39:04.973
in the west as it is, but the worst is in America.

00:39:05.323 --> 00:39:09.580
I mean they can abuse their father with a very dirty word,

00:39:09.706 --> 00:39:13.441
all the time they are using, even the judges. I was...

00:39:13.573 --> 00:39:20.493
I saw one film in which a judge used a dirty word,
I did not know much of that meaning,

00:39:20.565 --> 00:39:22.723
but it was not a good word that he used.

00:39:22.812 --> 00:39:29.412
So they become sort of, what's wrong, type of people with this arrogance.

00:39:29.522 --> 00:39:33.978
I don't know how we are going to convince them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:34.131 --> 00:39:40.206
I'm going to try also something like approaching these top class people

00:39:40.405 --> 00:39:42.696
to talk to them about it.

00:39:42.808 --> 00:39:45.413
Maybe, you see, they might feel influenced

00:39:45.485 --> 00:39:50.122
that these top class people have taken to it,
so there must be something about Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:50.343 --> 00:39:53.416
I wonder if they would talk about us so much -

00:39:53.486 --> 00:39:57.672
what Sahaja Yoga is, what it can do to this country.

00:39:57.768 --> 00:40:01.065
Because we have to save, really save this country.

00:40:01.221 --> 00:40:06.595
It is from all the sides, is under attack - from all the sides.

00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:10.107
You take morality part, it is under attack,

00:40:10.202 --> 00:40:14.459
you take from the artist’s point of view, it is under attack.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:18.600
They are not creating many artists there, I went to see

00:40:18.799 --> 00:40:21.513
their paintings there, their latest paintings

00:40:21.705 --> 00:40:26.702
with modern painting and all that -

00:40:26.917 --> 00:40:28.811
they haven't got the depth at all.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:35.930
It's all full of filthy things about it and they talk about absolutely filthy things.

00:40:36.493 --> 00:40:41.274
There is one artist from India,

00:40:41.386 --> 00:40:46.413
he went to America, and when I saw his paintings I was surprised.

00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:50.570
I said "What are you doing?", he said "This is what sells here".

00:40:50.761 --> 00:40:53.176
I said "And what about India?", he said "No, no,

00:40:53.253 --> 00:40:55.869
they will never touch it, it's horrible".

00:40:55.941 --> 00:40:59.306
He himself knows, but he said this will sell here,

00:40:59.401 --> 00:41:01.939
so he has made it like that.

00:41:02.305 --> 00:41:08.777
It's a point of judgement,

00:41:08.912 --> 00:41:13.309
whether you think it is worth selling or not, is the point.

00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:18.050
Now whom do you sell to these people who are not mature enough,

00:41:18.169 --> 00:41:21.657
who are so much enticed by the Mooladhara problem,

00:41:21.768 --> 00:41:25.631
how can you help them? How can you bring them around?

00:41:25.767 --> 00:41:33.002
It is a question of people maturing

00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:37.268
for which of course this Paramchaitanya will help, I am sure,

00:41:37.348 --> 00:41:40.415
the way yesterday you felt it, I'm sure,

00:41:40.495 --> 00:41:43.348
Paramchaitanya has to do something about it,

00:41:43.475 --> 00:41:44.951
it has to work it out,

00:41:45.011 --> 00:41:50.663
it has to enter into different...

00:41:51.913 --> 00:41:54.795
dimensions in human beings to understand.

00:41:55.014 --> 00:41:58.215
Like creating coincidences and all that

00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:04.209
and then bringing them down to Sahaja Yoga.
It can work out, no doubt.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:10.486
Also Sahaja Yogis must work there, I know there are very few,

00:42:10.577 --> 00:42:13.220
and that's why they were upset about it  because

00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:16.073
they were really working very hard

00:42:16.248 --> 00:42:21.481
and it didn't work out there so they feel that
there is something basically wrong.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.208
I have told you already what is wrong with them, is this,

00:42:25.308 --> 00:42:30.808
that they lack maturity as far as evolution is concerned.

00:42:31.006 --> 00:42:36.038
Even those who have come now to Sahaja Yoga have done very well.

00:42:36.173 --> 00:42:40.764
There are, of course, some who would not get so much of it.

00:42:40.922 --> 00:42:47.772
So what you have to do is to get to reality,

00:42:47.848 --> 00:42:52.618
to know what the problem is really and what we can do about it.

00:42:52.777 --> 00:42:58.648
Now, so many European leaders, or you can say European Sahaja Yogis

00:42:58.978 --> 00:43:03.979
are free because I am not going there  to Europe,

00:43:04.063 --> 00:43:08.310
so they should take charge also and can go sometimes

00:43:08.406 --> 00:43:15.406
and have some sort of a programme or find some conference, or whatever,

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:20.784
and get in contact with them and talk to them in such a manner

00:43:20.943 --> 00:43:26.753
that they do feel that this is something very remarkable.

00:43:27.007 --> 00:43:30.590
Something very much what they wanted,

00:43:30.724 --> 00:43:36.974
something that is the future of the whole world.

00:43:37.218 --> 00:43:41.147
So this global transformation is taking place

00:43:41.203 --> 00:43:44.504
and you have to talk on those lines a little strongly.

00:43:44.623 --> 00:43:47.455
But with media we had very bad experiences

00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:51.352
because we arranged a hall and we spent a lot of money there

00:43:51.455 --> 00:43:54.971
and not one person came from media, not one.

00:43:55.114 --> 00:43:56.844
So we did not know what to do,

00:43:56.947 --> 00:44:01.294
we had prepared so much food and everything was wasted,

00:44:01.397 --> 00:44:03.758
not one person from the media came.

00:44:03.935 --> 00:44:09.635
So also we can start a kind of a newspaper, could be,

00:44:09.797 --> 00:44:15.658
it could be some sort of a media of having cable TV

00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:19.997
or something like that by which we can propagate Sahaja Yoga

00:44:20.083 --> 00:44:23.900
and tell them what good it has done and what it can do.

00:44:23.996 --> 00:44:30.120
It's quite a mad place because they have so many books,

00:44:30.223 --> 00:44:34.608
everything is so much, every number is so much,

00:44:34.787 --> 00:44:38.657
that if you write a book also I do not know whether it will be lost.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.656
Now for today, I have to announce that my book is ready now,

00:44:42.728 --> 00:44:46.557
I have done it and I would like to publish it now

00:44:46.715 --> 00:44:51.506
so that it will be available to you and I'm sure you will enjoy it.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.424
Not only that but it will help you to understand the problems of the west.

00:44:56.618 --> 00:44:59.390
I have not dealt in that the problems of the east

00:44:59.509 --> 00:45:03.763
but I have dealt in that with the problems of the west,

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:08.634
what problems they have and how to tackle them.

00:45:08.976 --> 00:45:14.945
So this book they will be bringing now and showing you.

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:22.687
We will see how it is published and how people like it,

00:45:23.553 --> 00:45:26.451
that part I will do.

00:45:41.769 --> 00:45:46.555
I would say that I would not have liked
to write a book like that, to be very frank,

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:52.753
because for a person like me
I should only write all the splendour of spirituality,

00:45:52.896 --> 00:45:57.131
all the beauty of heavens, everything, all poetic things,

00:45:57.226 --> 00:46:03.214
but I thought reality is very different  and people must be told what is the reality.

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:07.564
So, I have ventured to write this, otherwise I would have liked to write something

00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:12.036
like Amrutananya written by Jyaneshwara,

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.397
but there's no controversy, nothing, just sweetness

00:46:15.485 --> 00:46:19.298
and just overflowing compassion, I would have been very happy,

00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:25.772
but that doesn't work out you see, it will float in the air I think.

00:46:25.923 --> 00:46:31.009
So I thought first I muswrite this book
and point out where are we wrong

00:46:31.124 --> 00:46:34.045
and to make you aware of it.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.626
Then what we can do is to have another book, I could have,

00:46:38.737 --> 00:46:42.412
with all my experiences with Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.103
It would be another interesting thing.

00:46:57.632 --> 00:47:03.113
One of the defects of these incarnations is that

00:47:03.161 --> 00:47:05.972
they never wrote a book themselves.

00:47:06.608 --> 00:47:10.575
You see Christ never wrote any book,
Krishna never wrote any book,

00:47:10.734 --> 00:47:12.109
Rama never wrote any book.

00:47:12.146 --> 00:47:15.158
They knew how to read and write but they never wrote.

00:47:15.325 --> 00:47:19.591
And then we have people; like Nanaka, who has written,

00:47:19.702 --> 00:47:26.846
not himself so much but he has compiled
all the great literature of the realized souls.

00:47:27.028 --> 00:47:34.989
Alright, then still what happens is something that they just read it

00:47:35.104 --> 00:47:41.264
word by word then they have to finish it in 2½ days the whole thing.

00:47:41.424 --> 00:47:44.958
So one person reads it puts the finger at one point, finished,

00:47:45.046 --> 00:47:48.907
then another one comes, starts from there,
puts the finger here, it is finished.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.983
Nothing goes in the head, you see that's the problem with it.

00:47:52.125 --> 00:47:55.153
The same with Mohammed Sahib, he never wrote the book.

00:47:55.281 --> 00:47:58.822
If he had himself written the book it would have been very different

00:47:58.996 --> 00:48:02.264
but somebody else in the 5th calipher,

00:48:02.341 --> 00:48:05.427
who was a very cruel and a bad man, who wrote it.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:07.485
The same thing has happened with the bible.

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:14.427
So you see it's like such a great diamond is put in the mud

00:48:14.609 --> 00:48:18.628
and everywhere there are complications because of this.

00:48:18.873 --> 00:48:21.992
You cannot blame these great people,

00:48:22.318 --> 00:48:26.914
but only thing that is happening is all bad name is coming to them.

00:48:27.033 --> 00:48:29.729
They are not the ones who wrote anything wrong,

00:48:29.825 --> 00:48:32.406
they are not the ones who would say anything wrong,

00:48:32.533 --> 00:48:36.175
but if the book falls into the hands of some people

00:48:36.286 --> 00:48:43.506
who are absolutely adharmic, who are cruel,
then this is what happens.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.454
Now, you see what's happening with the Catholic Church, you see what's happening with Muslims.

00:48:48.568 --> 00:48:52.706
Everywhere you find there is violence, there's corruption

00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:55.669
and there's fighting - this is no religion,

00:48:55.772 --> 00:48:59.302
nobody could have preached that thing -
but it is doing that way.

00:48:59.413 --> 00:49:04.290
So now you all stand out,
out of all this where you love each other,

00:49:04.434 --> 00:49:08.159
you care for each other,
you enjoy everything, despite that,

00:49:08.247 --> 00:49:11.370
your enjoyment is absolutely pure

00:49:11.703 --> 00:49:16.988
and this is what is to be seen by others and it can work out.

00:49:17.131 --> 00:49:23.095
I'm sure, one day in America, we will be there very successful.

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.976
MAY GOD BLESS YOU!!!
