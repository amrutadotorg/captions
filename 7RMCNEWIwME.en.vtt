00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:48.390

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.229
is all contained within you

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.189
only thing the guru does

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:52.409
makes you knowledgeable about your

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:59.789
knowledge about your own spirit everyone

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:04.700
has the spirit within himself everyone

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:09.390
has the spirituality within yourself

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.319
there is nothing that you get from

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.250
outside but before getting this

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:26.780
knowledge you are dealing or you are

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:32.280
living in ignorance in that ignorance

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:38.040
you do not know what clay here you have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:43.470
got within ear so the Guru's job is to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:48.950
make you know what you are that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.950
sensation that you should know your

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:01.400
but means you know yourself you know

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:05.570
party the experience is not so she the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:12.020
knowledge has to come and the Guru gives

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:16.670
the knowledge about yourself now you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.690
have to tell it you should find out

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.500
whatever your guru has to it is it true

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.360
or not

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.360
is it correct or not when we talk about

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:37.340
realization one has to do first of all

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:44.390
that we have to have patience with

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:46.510
ourselves I know some people don't feel

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.080
so good

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.880
some people still have sicknesses some

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:00.050
people don't even feel vibration

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:02.300
sometimes have patience with you when

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:07.670
you become your own guru first thing as

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:12.459
the Guru has patience with his or her

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.459
disciple you must have patience

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:28.840
in that patience you will learn that you

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:31.319
can tolerate so many things without any

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.319
club

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.000
they say one person who goes on grudging

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.000
oh this is not good that is not good

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:51.159
because they have no patience with

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:56.400
themselves if you have patience with

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:56.400
yourself everything you'll accept

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:05.009
wherever you are you are with yourself

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:09.629
cause you're realized Souls so you want

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.629
the state to not get angry

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:19.740
and also you not go on crumbling than

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:27.149
clutching because you are enjoying

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:32.039
yourself so for such people who have

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:33.659
imaginary miseries of the past which do

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.379
not exist in reality

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:46.139
they cannot have the joy of reality they

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:50.119
can so for a sahaja yogi is important

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.119
that he should have joy

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:10.070
within his heart it's like an ocean it's

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:21.550
like an ocean which is there all the

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:21.550
time to give you such trees

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:36.319
even little drops of this ocean when

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:41.180
they trickle down in your being it is so

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:48.979
soothing the experience can be only

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:55.509
experienced it's all waiting within

00:06:48.979 --> 00:07:00.110
yourself so I sahaja Yogi's and as gurus

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:01.099
we have to love ourselves and understand

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.969
our own wagon

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:08.360
I think sahaja Yogi's have not yet

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:15.560
understood their worth how many people

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:21.199
in this world can give realization how

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:23.930
many know about Kundalini so this is

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:29.990
what is to remember that you are a

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:33.919
sahaja yogi take abandon owning and

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:38.120
ending it's so simple even to say on the

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:41.479
mind it seems stupid to me but I have to

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.599
say because people forget you forget

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:47.629
that you are realizes use your vibratory

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:50.139
awareness for at least protecting

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:50.139
yourself

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.740
because there is negativity sitting next

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.550
to her so they're very careful about

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.960
this to remember that I am a sahaja yoga

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:07.110
once you say that you will know how you

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.580
have to behave what is the protocol you

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.010
will know what is the discipline you

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:18.410
have to follow you will know how to love

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:20.670
others everything this is the essence

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.580
that will give you complete confidence

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:29.580
in yourself and will be absolutely

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:34.800
secure try to establish the state that

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:38.370
you are sahaja yoga thus you become

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.190
gurus of yourself and of others I hope

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:45.780
we will understand as a guru what you

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:49.740
have to do as a guru there's so many

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:53.940
change and as your character yesterday

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:57.590
as they showed how love se has written

00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:04.730
about the Masters how they were about

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:09.990
about turmoil about jealousy about

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:12.510
talking loose they are so great they are

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:16.260
the Masters and they will be the Masters

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:20.490
and you will be the Guru's if you try to

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:24.000
do this what you hope to achieve I know

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:28.080
somehow achieve it but most of you have

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.320
to achieve with compassion and may about

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.320
this

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:53.670
[Music]
