WEBVTT

00:02.806 --> 00:11.017
So now we have all arrived here and we
are going to start this pilgrimage

00:12.311 --> 00:19.285
of travelling together.

00:21.944 --> 00:33.724
The journey is of a very subtle nature

00:34.377 --> 00:41.871
and, if we realize why we are here,
we’ll understand

00:42.072 --> 00:51.688
that all this Creation is watching you all

00:52.450 --> 00:58.615
and it’s trying to help you that you
should ascend

00:58.816 --> 01:06.006
and that you feel your depth and thus
enjoy your Self.

01:08.144 --> 01:13.101
The travel may not be very comfortable.

01:13.323 --> 01:21.468
The roads are

01:25.309 --> 01:33.550
so very filled with speed-breakers

01:33.899 --> 01:39.239
and all kinds of obstructions.

01:39.786 --> 01:45.380
Is a journey like of our ascent I felt,

01:46.391 --> 01:52.082
that our speed has to be brought down.

01:53.208 --> 02:00.305
In the West we have become very speedy,
no doubt,

02:00.506 --> 02:08.818
and to bring down this speed we have to use

02:12.945 --> 02:23.794
meditative process that we feel our peace
within ourselves.

02:28.064 --> 02:34.378
Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds

02:35.873 --> 02:42.647
and we react very fast

02:46.801 --> 02:51.403
to others and to these thoughts.

02:53.763 --> 02:58.187
So one has to be aware,

02:59.849 --> 03:06.951
one has to be knowing what is happening
within yourself,

03:10.114 --> 03:15.086
that the thoughts are bombarding you,

03:15.536 --> 03:20.520
you are trying to ascend

03:21.865 --> 03:29.857
and you find it very difficult to get rid
of the thoughts.

03:33.210 --> 03:36.895
The thought process can start

03:38.782 --> 03:44.920
by your conditioning or by your ego –
only two problems.

03:52.093 --> 03:57.663
And you are the one who is under
the challenge.

04:02.549 --> 04:07.243
So you have got these simple people
in the village

04:09.287 --> 04:17.768
who start watching everything but
they do not react.

04:18.725 --> 04:25.712
If you do not react then your thoughts
will give up.

04:27.672 --> 04:37.676
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

04:40.218 --> 04:47.628
but you are experiencing and enjoying
the silence,

04:48.550 --> 04:55.128
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

04:55.329 --> 05:01.865
of your being as well as whatever is
around you.

05:04.239 --> 05:09.405
You don’t have to force yourself to break
this habit,

05:12.313 --> 05:16.738
but just to be on the watch-out.

05:19.358 --> 05:25.517
It’s not necessary to talk too much
about it also,

05:29.239 --> 05:32.843
nor it is necessary

05:37.301 --> 05:41.829
to think about anything.

05:42.030 --> 05:48.368
Because supposing you see a tree –
so it’s a tree only.

05:48.569 --> 05:52.139
What are we going to think about it?

05:52.340 --> 05:57.773
And whatever we may think about it,
it’s going to be the tree!

06:00.588 --> 06:06.184
So there’s no harm in appearing little bit
stupid – doesn’t matter.

06:06.385 --> 06:13.120
But this is the basic thing, is, that when
we start analyzing,

06:13.321 --> 06:18.527
we are breaking our own nerves,

06:18.924 --> 06:26.963
and poisoning our own mind and brain.

06:29.626 --> 06:38.697
So to watch something without analysis,
without thinking about it, is reality.

06:41.710 --> 06:46.140
If you can achieve that point where
you watch everything

06:46.341 --> 06:51.075
without reacting, you are in reality,

06:56.177 --> 07:07.297
and then only the penetration into
the subtleties of your surroundings,

07:07.498 --> 07:12.479
of your relationships, your friendships

07:15.092 --> 07:21.696
the whole universe, dawns upon you.

07:24.843 --> 07:29.027
That’s why I’ve said that in this
pilgrimage

07:29.228 --> 07:37.288
the first thing we have to remember [is]
that we have to be aware ourselves.

07:37.489 --> 07:42.191
But when you are only thinking about
others,

07:42.392 --> 07:46.075
how others have to behave: “They should
do like this!” -

07:46.276 --> 07:53.365
that leave it to your leaders to break
their heads, that’s not your job.

07:53.968 --> 07:59.106
It’s a headache for them I know, but they
have to do it, it’s all right.

07:59.307 --> 08:04.765
But why do you want to break your heads
for nothing at all?

08:06.696 --> 08:10.684
So to judge others, to think of others,

08:10.885 --> 08:16.802
what they are doing, what’s wrong
with them,

08:18.305 --> 08:28.448
about anything whatsoever you may think
is wrong – is not going to be corrected.

08:29.482 --> 08:34.524
Like I know some people who are specially
bureaucrats,

08:34.725 --> 08:38.989
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

08:39.190 --> 08:46.696
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

08:46.897 --> 08:51.818
or “I think it would have been nice if this
house was facing the other way” –

08:52.019 --> 08:59.282
but it’s not, you see? It is not going
to face [that way].

08:59.695 --> 09:07.193
It is going to be the way it is, so what is
the use of wasting your brain,

09:07.394 --> 09:16.782
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something which doesn’t work out,

09:16.983 --> 09:20.631
and never going to work out either.

09:21.871 --> 09:25.903
So when we start like, “I think

09:26.674 --> 09:32.855
these trees should have been little
taller” – but they are not!

09:35.264 --> 09:37.829
“I think

09:42.477 --> 09:50.337
that the crows should stop their noise” –
they will not.

09:52.713 --> 09:59.291
So just accept it. Acceptance is the way

10:00.347 --> 10:06.460
we are going to enjoy. But acceptance
doesn’t mean tolerance,

10:06.661 --> 10:12.867
because tolerance means you have
to work very hard

10:13.068 --> 10:17.022
to accept that the trees are of the same
height –

10:17.223 --> 10:20.248
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

10:20.449 --> 10:26.629
When you say, “I have to tolerate it,
you see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

10:32.717 --> 10:39.214
So acceptance as it is whatever you see,
acceptance.

10:39.619 --> 10:43.543
And that is how people grow I have seen,
those who start accepting.

10:43.744 --> 10:51.154
That’s the sign. That’s the sign of their
strength and their depth.

10:51.355 --> 10:58.440
Like the propensity of this Mother Earth,
She is what She is.

11:03.010 --> 11:07.919
And She bears whatever is there.

11:11.179 --> 11:19.532
If you put a heavy thing on Her, She’ll put
equal and opposite force and bear it.

11:19.733 --> 11:25.656
She doesn’t say, “I’m tolerating it,
I am exerting any pressure”.

11:25.857 --> 11:29.282
But She is just accepting.

11:32.518 --> 11:38.625
So the witnessing and awareness develops

11:38.826 --> 11:44.220
when we start just accepting things
as they are.

11:45.243 --> 11:49.304
“I think” doesn’t work out.

11:52.560 --> 11:58.027
“I think it would have been better like
this” doesn’t work out.

12:01.202 --> 12:05.449
Then second problem is “I like”.

12:07.660 --> 12:14.800
Now, “I like to eat a cake” - but there is
no cake, what to do?

12:17.155 --> 12:22.085
Now, whatever is there, enjoy it as a cake.

12:23.580 --> 12:31.045
But if you go on thinking like that –
“I like whatever is not here” –

12:31.246 --> 12:35.867
you can never be happy, as simple as that.

12:36.068 --> 12:43.741
You have to say, “I like whatever is there.

12:44.740 --> 12:50.930
I enjoy whatever is there”. Then that’s
the reality.

12:51.131 --> 12:58.839
Whatever doesn’t exist, if you like it,

13:01.338 --> 13:05.012
so what can anybody do about it?

13:08.703 --> 13:15.226
It works out in so many ways, in so many
facets in life,

13:15.427 --> 13:23.951
that advantage is taken by people because
we become so vulnerable

13:24.152 --> 13:29.552
to our likes and dislikes that
the entrepreneurs take over

13:29.753 --> 13:36.393
and they create likes and dislikes
in our heads, and put ideas every day.

13:36.594 --> 13:39.681
I’ve seen it now, how they do it,

13:39.882 --> 13:44.058
through television, through newspapers,
through this, that.

13:44.259 --> 13:48.422
So then you say, “Now, I like this”.

13:49.646 --> 13:53.538
But from where this liking has come

13:53.747 --> 13:58.906
is the conditioning which is put
into your head.

14:02.381 --> 14:08.110
So you are a slave of that conditioning.

14:11.422 --> 14:20.610
“I only like roses and I don’t like
any other flower”.

14:20.811 --> 14:28.631
But why? Why you don’t like any
other flower?

14:33.366 --> 14:41.844
And for such things whatever we have
we miss the joy.

14:45.117 --> 14:53.022
So the second part should be that,
“Enjoy everything.”

14:56.583 --> 14:59.823
“Why am I here?

15:03.778 --> 15:13.441
It’s not a very comfortable place
by any chance, so why am I here?”

15:17.292 --> 15:21.513
To enjoy each other.

15:24.202 --> 15:27.842
To enjoy your own being.

15:28.043 --> 15:36.450
The more divergence you have outside,
appealing to your ego and conditioning,

15:36.651 --> 15:41.334
the more your mind is busy with that,

15:44.478 --> 15:52.474
then you cannot enjoy anything.

15:55.562 --> 16:00.475
So come to the other conditioning which
is very subtle

16:02.152 --> 16:08.427
that, “I’m an Englishman”, or
“I’m an American”,

16:08.628 --> 16:19.679
or maybe even “I’m from Derbyshire”,
and then “I’m from another shire”,

16:21.041 --> 16:25.088
and then “better form a group”.

16:27.917 --> 16:31.508
The grouping starts.

16:32.278 --> 16:39.564
In a subtle way it is a kind
of an insecurity.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.391
So we start clubbing.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.450
Animals do that very often, they have
to do it

16:53.651 --> 16:58.216
because their sense of insecurity
is quite a lot.

16:58.417 --> 17:03.136
And then human beings also do it -

17:03.580 --> 17:08.895
but not the saints, not the angels.

17:09.268 --> 17:14.513
They don’t form [groups] because they have
no nationality.

17:15.859 --> 17:19.979
Nationality is also a conditioning.

17:22.523 --> 17:28.363
They don’t belong to any one place,
to any one country.

17:29.347 --> 17:33.875
So now those who have come by plane,
had to come,

17:34.076 --> 17:40.287
because from every country there’s
one plane by which they come,

17:40.971 --> 17:48.435
must know one thing – that now we have
landed,

17:48.636 --> 17:56.701
and we are all Sahaj Yogis here,
and forget your countries.

17:57.539 --> 18:05.146
Forget them and mix up with other people.

18:05.347 --> 18:11.509
Please do not form groups. There is no need
at all to form groups.

18:11.710 --> 18:19.413
So I would request you that in the buses,
because it starts from the airport

18:19.614 --> 18:25.484
you start forming groups and it continues
till the end you go back.

18:25.685 --> 18:33.101
I think it would be a nice idea to break
that, and let people sit

18:33.302 --> 18:41.589
together of different countries and
different nationalities.

18:41.790 --> 18:46.316
And talk to each other, try to know
about each other,

18:46.517 --> 18:49.256
try to find out about each other.

18:49.457 --> 18:55.840
Not just what you know from the newspaper,

18:56.091 --> 19:01.794
but the different problems of Sahaja Yoga,

19:01.995 --> 19:05.710
what are the problems of Sahaja Yoga
in a particular country,

19:05.919 --> 19:09.988
what happens in a particular country.

19:11.933 --> 19:20.450
The worst of all is the conditioning
of reading also.

19:27.808 --> 19:33.298
Reading without light is useless,

19:33.806 --> 19:38.696
and some people still have a habit

19:39.019 --> 19:44.985
of remembering something they have read

19:45.850 --> 19:51.016
and a kind of a show-off as they say.

19:53.386 --> 20:01.915
Is better to listen to others.
Let others talk.

20:02.560 --> 20:11.069
In Sahaja Yoga on what subject
you’ll discuss?

20:11.364 --> 20:16.556
I don’t know, how can you discuss
on anything?

20:16.757 --> 20:24.059
Now you see this one as a green thing.

20:25.355 --> 20:28.703
Now, what can you discuss on this?

20:28.904 --> 20:34.424
You will say, “All right, it’s green, but…
there is so”.

20:34.625 --> 20:39.797
Then another one says, “No, this is green,
but…”.

20:41.190 --> 20:45.335
One may go on like that, madly.

20:45.993 --> 20:50.376
There is no need to discuss in Sahaja Yoga.

20:50.577 --> 20:53.778
I just don’t know what are we going
to discuss. You know everything,

20:53.979 --> 20:57.878
you know how Kundalini rises, you know
how chakras are cleared out,

20:58.079 --> 21:02.182
you know how you get realization,
you all know who’s, who catches,

21:02.383 --> 21:07.951
what, and you know that how it affects.

21:08.152 --> 21:14.617
Now, if that is the fact, if that is
the truth, that is what it is,

21:14.818 --> 21:18.726
what are we going to discuss about it?

21:19.592 --> 21:22.976
Discussions are over now.

21:23.821 --> 21:30.765
You are gnostics, you are knowledgeable
people. You have the knowledge.

21:31.065 --> 21:35.847
But the knowledge that you have is shared
by everyone of you.

21:36.048 --> 21:41.250
At the most, you can talk about
your experiences,

21:41.451 --> 21:50.530
you can talk about your relationships,
how you have enjoyed.

21:51.366 --> 21:55.580
But there is nothing to discuss
in Sahaja Yoga.

21:55.781 --> 22:00.215
I’ve heard about people who are discussing.

22:00.787 --> 22:05.705
I just don’t know how can there be
a discussion about Sahaja Yoga.

22:06.189 --> 22:09.358
I would be very happy to know, if you can
tell Me,

22:09.559 --> 22:13.340
how we can discuss about Sahaja Yoga.

22:18.459 --> 22:24.001
So we have to remember that whatever
we talk, we should talk

22:24.202 --> 22:31.159
about our experiences, about our enjoyments,
our happiness, everything.

22:31.360 --> 22:39.971
And not to discuss it and analyze it,
because that would kill the joy completely.

22:41.782 --> 22:45.201
There’s no joy in it.

22:45.402 --> 22:50.010
Discussion is just trying to show that
you know better than the other,

22:50.211 --> 22:56.649
or you can give another opinion. In Sahaja
Yoga there is no another opinion.

22:57.149 --> 23:04.251
If somebody has a Nabhi, he has a Nabhi,
what another opinion you can have?

23:07.114 --> 23:16.160
So then we finish with different kinds
of arguments and discussions and things.

23:16.361 --> 23:22.776
Maybe somebody goes off the track, maybe.

23:22.977 --> 23:28.738
But you all know he is going off the track,
so what’s the use of discussing it?

23:29.436 --> 23:32.804
You all know what he is talking is off
the track, so it’s all right.

23:33.005 --> 23:36.516
You come to the conclusion, “Yeah, we know,
we know, we know”.

23:36.717 --> 23:42.703
But to discuss it out, there is no need.

23:42.904 --> 23:49.004
Once you know and it is in your awareness,
the Paramchaitanya will take care of it

23:49.205 --> 23:53.095
and you won’t have to bother at all

23:53.296 --> 23:58.435
how to correct, how to mend it, what to do.

23:59.477 --> 24:06.793
That’s not your work. You just leave it
to Paramchaitanya and it will work out.

24:09.170 --> 24:13.879
So here we have come because this country
has been very much blessed

24:14.080 --> 24:21.826
by so many saints and yogis, and you can
see it in the people how they are.

24:22.843 --> 24:27.728
And that’s why, despite all poverty,
despite all kinds of discomforts,

24:27.929 --> 24:37.213
and despite the fact that they have not
known any Western great things,

24:37.414 --> 24:41.457
they are not bothered.

24:43.422 --> 24:48.898
I went to Russia, of course Russia was
great and so many got realization.

24:49.099 --> 24:55.772
And I was really surprised how these people
have come to Sahaja Yoga

24:57.262 --> 25:04.794
and accepted it. But one part was
very funny,

25:04.995 --> 25:09.753
which was I would say, like the villagers
of this country.

25:09.954 --> 25:16.752
Those who are still not so matured would
not come to Sahaja Yoga as such,

25:16.953 --> 25:22.815
but the difference of their character
was really remarkable,

25:23.016 --> 25:27.567
because - you are going by a taxi.

25:27.956 --> 25:34.025
So the taxi fellow says, “Have you got
a Marlboro cigarette with you?”.

25:35.464 --> 25:37.989
I said, “What is that? I have never
known of it”.

25:38.190 --> 25:44.098
“No, if you have one then we’ll take you
free, or we’ll charge you very little”.

25:44.299 --> 25:47.611
But an Indian will never say such a thing,
he doesn’t know all these things,

25:47.812 --> 25:50.615
he’s not bothered.

25:51.059 --> 25:54.862
But if an Indian taxi fellow is going,
he’ll say,

25:55.063 --> 25:59.480
“Have you got a photograph of Mataji
with you?”.

26:04.535 --> 26:07.367
That’s a big difference!

26:16.071 --> 26:20.192
In every aspect I have seen that this
another -

26:20.393 --> 26:25.173
like there are villagers here, people who
are not Sahaja Yogis,

26:25.374 --> 26:29.203
but they respect, they respect the saint.

26:29.404 --> 26:33.796
To them saint is more important than
anything else.

26:35.322 --> 26:40.398
Nobody will ask you for anything – never!

26:40.683 --> 26:44.982
Even if you want to give them, they will
not accept.

26:47.072 --> 26:51.281
They may cheat you, some people who
are selling things,

26:51.482 --> 26:55.498
but they will never ask from you that,
“You give me this, you give me that”,

26:55.699 --> 26:58.400
that’s not done.

26:58.929 --> 27:05.269
So the, basically I think there is a
difference which we should understand,

27:05.671 --> 27:15.421
that materialism works much faster
in the West than in India, much faster.

27:16.945 --> 27:24.033
And one has to be careful on that point.
I’m bringing you down to that point now -

27:25.155 --> 27:32.026
that, are we getting lost into materialism?

27:35.547 --> 27:37.987
Of course you know I’m a great shopper,

27:38.188 --> 27:42.963
I have to go on shopping, shopping,
shopping, shopping.

27:43.164 --> 27:48.790
And I shop for all of you, and I have been
shopping, no doubt.

27:49.856 --> 27:56.305
But the difference between My shopping
and the shopping of so many is this –

27:56.506 --> 28:00.167
that if I’m shopping I am going there

28:00.368 --> 28:04.448
because I know I’ll get things much
cheaper, much better.

28:04.649 --> 28:09.867
All the good things will be there available
because I’m there – I’m sure of that;

28:10.068 --> 28:15.581
and all the best qualities will be
available very easily,

28:16.504 --> 28:23.590
and that I will be able to get things

28:23.791 --> 28:29.348
for people, because I’ll remember all
of them for whom I have to buy.

28:29.882 --> 28:33.147
It always happens like that.

28:34.579 --> 28:40.399
When I go out for shopping, even if I have
to face four hundred people,

28:40.600 --> 28:47.121
I get the things there all right.
That’s why I have to go.

28:49.753 --> 28:55.096
All right, if you have to go then you have
to think, “What we are going to buy?”.

28:55.297 --> 29:00.729
I have seen invariably Sahaja Yogis
will buy

29:00.930 --> 29:04.830
things for non-Sahaja Yogis, always,
mostly.

29:05.031 --> 29:10.224
“I’m buying for my mother, my sister
who is against Sahaja Yoga”.

29:10.425 --> 29:15.134
Why should you buy for somebody who is
against Sahaja Yoga?

29:15.335 --> 29:20.793
Even if they might be your nearest
relations,

29:22.053 --> 29:25.495
do you think they deserve it?

29:27.904 --> 29:33.813
So then we have to know that we are
one body,

29:34.014 --> 29:37.340
and as this hand must look after
the other hand,

29:37.541 --> 29:41.749
when we go out shopping or do anything,
we should always think

29:41.950 --> 29:46.985
what we are going to buy for other
Sahaja Yogis.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.266
Of course, I have told you that, unless
and until somebody is your sister

29:50.467 --> 29:55.017
by rakhi or anything, you need not give
presents.

29:56.275 --> 30:01.239
But women can buy for women, men can
buy for men.

30:01.440 --> 30:05.211
Just understand one small thing –

30:05.412 --> 30:09.437
that the matter is for expression
of our love, that’s all.

30:09.638 --> 30:14.929
It has no other meaning. I don’t find
any meaning into it.

30:18.663 --> 30:22.033
So instead of buying for… when we,
people travel from here

30:22.234 --> 30:27.780
they go as traders, I’ve seen. Of course
you come as traders also –

30:27.981 --> 30:34.630
but that’s something Dharmic. But when
you go from here you go as traders,

30:34.831 --> 30:38.192
and for whom are you buying?

30:39.979 --> 30:46.452
Your relationships are no more with
anybody else but Sahaja Yogis,

30:46.716 --> 30:50.410
and only Sahaja Yogis.

30:53.941 --> 30:57.665
Whether they are Indians,

30:59.033 --> 31:06.357
English, Chinese, Swiss, French, Spanish,

31:07.137 --> 31:19.543
Germans, anything they may think to be,
they are Sahaja Yogis,

31:19.744 --> 31:26.709
and they are born in the land which
we call as the Kingdom of God.

31:26.910 --> 31:29.832
So please be careful on this point.

31:30.033 --> 31:35.409
Today being the first day I wanted to
explain to you everything in such a manner

31:35.610 --> 31:38.469
that you remember that we are
on a pilgrimage,

31:38.670 --> 31:44.162
and all of us should be able to grow
our awareness.

31:44.363 --> 31:49.344
If you cannot grow your awareness
it is useless.

31:53.286 --> 31:57.947
Once you start thinking like that,
you’ll be surprised

31:58.148 --> 32:02.580
how much you will gain and how much
you’ll achieve.

32:06.199 --> 32:11.576
There are no do’s and don’ts
in Sahaja Yoga, really,

32:11.777 --> 32:17.302
and I don’t think we have much disciplining
either, of any kind.

32:17.503 --> 32:22.437
But it is Sahaja Yoga which somehow
or other disciplines you,

32:22.638 --> 32:26.383
I don’t have to tell you anything.
It’s like the fire,

32:26.584 --> 32:31.612
if you put your hand into the fire it will
burn you, whether you like it or not.

32:31.813 --> 32:37.547
In the same way, if you do anything asahaj,
you will have to pay for it.

32:37.748 --> 32:41.387
So you know definitely that you don’t
want to lose your vibrations,

32:41.588 --> 32:45.134
you don’t want to become unhappy.

32:45.335 --> 32:49.781
But this time with a very deeper
understanding and reverence

32:49.982 --> 32:56.074
to your Self and to your ascent,

32:56.275 --> 33:09.796
you have to take a very joyful,
serious attitude.

33:10.313 --> 33:16.869
I’m sure this time you all are going
to just enjoy your Self.

33:17.070 --> 33:19.911
May God bless you.
