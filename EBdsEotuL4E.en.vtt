Diwali Puja Talk. Istanbul (Turkey)
November 5, 1994.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:16.442
Today we are going to celebrate the Diwali,

00:00:16.593 --> 00:00:21.795
which means the rows of lights

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:26.142
or, you can say, group of lights.

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:45.830
Need somebody to translate in Turkish also;

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.595
it's all right.

00:00:53.068 --> 00:01:03.907
This Diwali has been a festival of
very ancient times in India.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:26.502
I already told in My previous lectures
what are these five days are.

00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:59.668
After killing Narakasura, Diwali was celebrated

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:06.804
when it was the darkest night of the year.

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:27.880
So now, it is very symbolic of these modern times,

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:53.314
because the worst time,  as far as morality’s
concerned

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:58.091
has been in these modern times.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:21.099
We call it the Ghor Kali Yuga.

00:03:29.661 --> 00:03:31.526
Ghor Kali Yuga

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:34.291
Ghor Kali Yuga, the worst modern times

00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:51.312
That means a complete darkness

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.758
and, as you see around, you’ll find out

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.313
that there is complete darkness

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.846
as far as morality is concerned,

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:30.842
but that’s why there are all kinds of crises.

00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:57.871
Because of that, also,

00:04:58.024 --> 00:05:02.801
there are many who are seeking the light, the truth.

00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:22.857
In the darkness of ignorance,

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:29.381
people have no knowledge as to what

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:35.172
they should do, why or they are on this Earth.

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:58.785
As you know very well, that thousands
and thousands of real seekers

00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.622
who are born at this time,

00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:20.871
that is why this job was given to Me

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.554
is to create Diwali in this dark ages of ignorance.

00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:55.228
It’s not an easy job because, on one side,

00:06:55.368 --> 00:07:01.099
we have all the dark forces acting against the truth.

00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:30.812
Also, on the other side, we have to fight the false people

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:36.547
who are taking advantage of your seeking.

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:02.582
Firstly, people don’t know what to seek,

00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:15.700
so all these false people have been money-oriented

00:08:15.717 --> 00:08:22.738
and they tried to work out
marketing of their falsehood

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:48.639
and they have the expertise to do it.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.319
Somebody asked Me [UNCLEAR], television ....

00:09:07.344 --> 00:09:11.269
what about the cults that are killing people and doing

00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:16.645
all sorts of things that they did in Switzerland.

00:09:37.233 --> 00:09:43.362
So I said it’s true, they are crooks,
they are horrible, they are criminals

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:45.896
who call themselves as spiritual,

00:09:45.921 --> 00:09:52.530
but the mistake lies with the people who follow.

00:10:17.873 --> 00:10:23.468
So a person who is absolutely immoral,

00:10:23.772 --> 00:10:27.446
absolutely dishonest,

00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:31.805
who launders money to Swiss banks,

00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:35.219
cannot be a guru.

00:10:53.346 --> 00:11:00.118
He used to buy these drugs and sell them.

00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:03.774
He used to buy weapons and sell them.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.600
He was worse than his disciples,
much worse.

00:11:45.075 --> 00:11:50.561
They have used a kind of a suggestion

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:54.240
from the books of so-called Guru Gita or something

00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:59.269
where it is said you should surrender
everything to your guru.

00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:31.707
That means it was to suggest
that a disciple should be willing

00:12:31.859 --> 00:12:35.664
to surrender everything to the guru.

00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:58.919
So, it was for the disciple,

00:12:59.134 --> 00:13:02.227
but for the guru,
he should not grab anything,

00:13:02.252 --> 00:13:06.195
he shouldn’t ask for anything,
he should not be greedy.

00:13:06.223 --> 00:13:09.541
All these things are already written down.

00:13:34.278 --> 00:13:38.375
But nobody reads what is required of a guru

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:40.655
and only they see that

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:44.294
you have to surrender everything to the guru.

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:13.114
Why I’m telling you all this,

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:23.903
because how the darkness is
so deep and so dangerous.

00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:51.145
Moreover, the other day I read an article

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:53.792
who said that in Milan

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:58.471
there is a very, very organisation,

00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:02.657
a global organisation of Satanism.

00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:28.869
Many politicians and many people in the government,

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:33.951
very highly placed ministers,
prime ministers are involved in it.

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:08.439
Many people who are bank managers
or bank owners

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.339
and also the people who call
themselves social workers

00:16:35.858 --> 00:16:41.828
and also those who have got peace
award and this award, that award.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:10.439
So this is what is the worst times
of Kali Yuga, modern times.

00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:29.489
Now, the second day of Diwali, last day,

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:37.440
is where a brother and sisters
celebrate together

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:43.890
for relationship which is
so pure and so protective.

00:18:08.684 --> 00:18:13.378
That is to show that, after putting the lights,

00:18:13.403 --> 00:18:21.104
morality must be the first
priority for the society.

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:49.468
I need not tell you today

00:18:49.564 --> 00:18:54.187
immoral side of modern times. It’s horrible.

00:19:15.897 --> 00:19:21.349
Immorality is the greatest darkness of modern times

00:19:21.374 --> 00:19:25.561
where people do not know
how they relate to each other

00:19:53.223 --> 00:19:57.653
for which, as I told you before,
Christ has suggested

00:19:57.678 --> 00:20:00.251
that you take out the eyes of a man

00:20:00.275 --> 00:20:03.094
who looks at a woman twice

00:20:54.843 --> 00:20:59.128
because He found, at that time, people were horrid.

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:17.292
Who can follow Christ in these modern times?

00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:21.795
Both the eyes, both the hands will be cut off.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.966
On the whole, if you see,

00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:52.564
I haven’t seen any Christian like that, so far.

00:22:24.938 --> 00:22:27.707
Mohammed-sahib was even more strict.

00:22:27.742 --> 00:22:30.997
He thought nothing has been done for the women,

00:22:31.022 --> 00:22:34.428
so he passed through some regulations about women also.

00:23:12.383 --> 00:23:17.830
So he said that any woman who looks
at a man with bad eyes

00:23:18.002 --> 00:23:23.287
should be buried halfway
and should be killed by stoning.

00:23:46.389 --> 00:23:50.293
I don’t know what would have happened
to the American ladies

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.439
if they have follow this.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.372
So when I came to this Earth

00:24:12.447 --> 00:24:19.075
I discovered that these two are
very difficult, specially in Kali Yuga.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:52.509
These laws are actually meant

00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:56.594
for not normal human beings,
but for angels.

00:25:16.722 --> 00:25:23.510
So modern man is even worse
than a normal human being

00:25:39.968 --> 00:25:46.239
because they want something destructive all the time,

00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:50.348
like the Spanish ask the bull to hit them.

00:26:57.934 --> 00:27:03.766
Now the description of modern times

00:27:05.844 --> 00:27:13.478
is there to show you in
what times we are living

00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:38.220
and I realised this not an easy thing

00:27:38.329 --> 00:27:42.286
to talk to them about anything

00:27:42.392 --> 00:27:47.243
that is good without giving them realisation.

00:28:09.923 --> 00:28:13.677
Unless and until you give them realisation,

00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:18.052
nothing can penetrate into their minds

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:22.320
on just mental level.

00:28:47.677 --> 00:28:54.059
And also giving only lectures and sermons,

00:28:54.127 --> 00:28:57.420
the whole thing will be at a mental level only.

00:29:19.472 --> 00:29:24.003
And also the religions which are so-called

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:30.192
are really very harmful for
the spiritual growth of human beings.

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:59.548
I felt that enlightenment is the only way

00:29:59.747 --> 00:30:02.072
one can save this world.

00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:22.888
In this darkness of ignorance,

00:30:22.905 --> 00:30:29.711
the darkest night of the whole history of this world,

00:30:31.399 --> 00:30:38.888
we needed light and lights, many lights.

00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:06.239
Agni,

00:31:06.271 --> 00:31:08.421
You to say sanskrit

00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:12.805
Yes, Agni means fire in Sanskrit language.

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:34.090
All right.

00:31:36.844 --> 00:31:41.205
So the world divided into so many countries,

00:31:41.221 --> 00:31:48.246
so many races, so many languages

00:31:48.702 --> 00:31:52.950
and also their own thinking -

00:31:55.177 --> 00:32:01.165
think of a global religion

00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:06.567
was only possible when people got their realisation.

00:32:59.118 --> 00:33:06.224
So, I had to tell you, human beings,

00:33:07.187 --> 00:33:10.028
what are their problems.

00:33:24.018 --> 00:33:28.430
So, in a light, in India,

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:34.596
we have the pot or the container
which is made of clay,

00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:38.933
then the oil, and then the wick.

00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:16.051
Now, this body, this mind,

00:34:16.603 --> 00:34:22.066
you can call all that is visible

00:34:22.257 --> 00:34:27.055
and is within, is all the pot

00:34:48.964 --> 00:34:55.093
and the oil is the compassion, the love

00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:11.943
and the wick is the Kundalini,
the pure desire,

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:53.114
and the spark is the spirit.

00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:14.914
So, first of all, the container has to be all right.

00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:18.133
It should be all right.

00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:37.424
It should be able to contain the oil properly

00:36:37.781 --> 00:36:42.157
and should not allow it to ooze out.

00:37:01.722 --> 00:37:08.383
Now there are two holes that cause problem.

00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:13.656
One is your ego.
Another is your conditionings.

00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:46.226
So, if a Sahaja Yogi

00:37:48.357 --> 00:37:50.992
thinks of his conditionings,

00:37:51.439 --> 00:37:55.520
that “I am a Christian or, you can say,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:00.190
that I come from this race,
I’m this community,”

00:38:00.347 --> 00:38:06.300
so all these limitations with
which we have built ourselves

00:38:06.597 --> 00:38:11.026
are so flimsy that they break out

00:38:54.966 --> 00:38:58.354
because there is no reality in them.

00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:04.123
There’s no substance so they fizzle out.

00:39:33.061 --> 00:39:36.592
They all act like possessions

00:39:36.697 --> 00:39:40.326
and a person becomes absolutely blind.

00:40:06.748 --> 00:40:13.164
After coming to Sahaja Yoga,
I’ve seen Christians will adhere to Christ,

00:40:13.207 --> 00:40:18.320
Muslims will adhere to Mohammed-sahib or to Ali

00:40:18.792 --> 00:40:25.637
and others will adhere to the conditionings
from which they have come,

00:41:09.243 --> 00:41:11.195
but they don’t adhere to Me,

00:41:11.203 --> 00:41:17.110
so they cannot see the integration of
all these personalities in one person.

00:41:49.709 --> 00:41:52.748
One has to know, on this point,

00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:56.933
that you have got the light.

00:41:58.382 --> 00:42:01.193
You are enlightened.

00:42:18.688 --> 00:42:23.053
You are not an egg.
You have become a bird.

00:42:33.703 --> 00:42:38.815
So you have to give up all that is falsehood.

00:42:59.851 --> 00:43:06.354
If you are fully enlightened you will give up
automatically, you don’t have to be told.

00:43:29.033 --> 00:43:32.160
When the light is enlightened,

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:36.131
it automatically feel responsible

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:39.070
that it has to give light.

00:44:01.336 --> 00:44:07.555
Nobody has to tell that
“You please give light”

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.826
because it is light.

00:44:29.684 --> 00:44:34.911
Because it is eternal light,
nothing can kill it.

00:44:57.326 --> 00:45:00.035
I will say a Sanskrit Shloka,

00:45:00.059 --> 00:45:04.495
Nainam chidanti sashtrani
Nainam dahanti pavaka

00:45:04.505 --> 00:45:08.793
Chayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha

00:45:09.048 --> 00:45:14.446
means it cannot be killed by [UNCLEAR],

00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:20.929
not air can blow it away,

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.916
nothing can destroy it.

00:45:26.646 --> 00:45:31.590
Even if you want to suck it, you cannot.

00:45:31.735 --> 00:45:36.195
It’s such a powerful light you have got within yourself.

00:46:20.192 --> 00:46:25.662
You can verify whether it is eternal or not.

00:46:37.012 --> 00:46:40.178
You should introspect and see for yourself.

00:46:40.203 --> 00:46:45.745
You’ve got such a unique light within you.

00:47:10.187 --> 00:47:17.414
Not in the history of this world of spirituality

00:47:17.761 --> 00:47:24.452
so many have got realisation,
such light within them..

00:47:53.919 --> 00:47:58.616
So how could these stupid, flimsy,

00:47:58.641 --> 00:48:01.500
useless conditionings

00:48:02.098 --> 00:48:07.483
dominate you now when you are
the carrier of eternal light?

00:48:39.113 --> 00:48:42.830
But if you don’t respect this eternal light,

00:48:42.862 --> 00:48:45.984
then the conditionings will put it out.

00:49:04.889 --> 00:49:06.546
This is the only problem,

00:49:06.571 --> 00:49:09.937
that you have the freedom.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:13.077
You want to have the eternal light, you’ll have it,

00:49:13.102 --> 00:49:18.747
otherwise this light can be damaged completely.

00:49:47.282 --> 00:49:53.020
So, the another hole is that of ego.

00:50:06.683 --> 00:50:15.329
One side, conditioning can be resolved
by the sense of responsibility.

00:50:34.886 --> 00:50:37.854
The same sense of responsibility,

00:50:37.879 --> 00:50:43.232
when asserted through ego,
could be very dangerous.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.424
This light can become fire

00:51:23.065 --> 00:51:26.953
and it can burn the house of Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:46.588 --> 00:51:56.110
A normal life, we know
that light is for giving us light,

00:51:56.337 --> 00:51:58.592
not for burning houses,

00:52:19.243 --> 00:52:23.441
but when you get to ego in Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:24.153 --> 00:52:28.105
you can think that you are responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.800
but this responsibility

00:53:01.398 --> 00:53:05.638
should not give you an idea
that you are in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

00:53:28.307 --> 00:53:32.354
So, gradually then, you become so right-sided

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.874
and people are surprised that how

00:53:35.884 --> 00:53:41.323
this man who was normal has become
like a bull in the china shop.

00:53:43.727 --> 00:53:45.790
bull in the china shop

00:53:47.813 --> 00:53:50.908
bull in the china shop.

00:53:51.313 --> 00:53:53.733
English phrase.

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:36.778
So you are not in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.879
It’s like government servants.

00:55:03.895 --> 00:55:08.102
They are suppose to be servants,
but they are the bosses.

00:55:26.716 --> 00:55:28.889
They become bosses.

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:47.543
So, the whole understanding

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.476
should be of complete wisdom in Sahaj Yoga.

00:56:20.456 --> 00:56:24.963
The second part is the oil,

00:56:39.872 --> 00:56:41.839
which is compassion,

00:56:49.889 --> 00:56:55.764
which is natural, innate and joy-giving.

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:12.577
This oil has to be pure.

00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:22.232
The compassion has to be pure.

00:57:28.675 --> 00:57:36.000
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis
try to trouble the leaders.

00:57:51.932 --> 00:57:57.750
They oppose the leader and try to hinder
the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:18.852
Now, these are suppose to be Sahaja Yogis

00:58:18.934 --> 00:58:25.294
and they don’t understand if their compassion is pure

00:58:25.416 --> 00:58:27.981
they will appreciate their leader

00:58:27.997 --> 00:58:32.229
because the leader is doing such a compassionate work.

00:59:09.265 --> 00:59:14.348
Of course, pure compassion, one must understand,

00:59:14.373 --> 00:59:17.422
has nothing to do with greed,

00:59:17.811 --> 00:59:20.495
with temptations, nothing to do.

00:59:42.936 --> 00:59:46.477
One has to feel such nearness

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.956
with the leader and appreciativeness of the work

00:59:50.996 --> 00:59:54.603
he or she is putting in.

01:00:12.562 --> 01:00:15.419
So Compassion cannot be impure.

01:00:15.427 --> 01:00:18.858
There cannot be lust in it.

01:00:39.392 --> 01:00:45.147
More over this compassion should be
express in such a descent

01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:49.587
manner that nobody should doubt your compassion.

01:01:14.246 --> 01:01:17.707
Thank God, this one good thing has happened,

01:01:17.732 --> 01:01:21.264
people don’t kiss you.

01:01:42.108 --> 01:01:47.539
First time when I went to western countries,

01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:53.910
I was just bombarded with kisses.
I didn’t know what to say — I mean horrible.

01:02:19.927 --> 01:02:22.291
There may not be anything wrong in the mind,

01:02:22.315 --> 01:02:26.849
but it’s so indecent and stupid.

01:02:56.837 --> 01:02:58.860
Long time back

01:02:59.402 --> 01:03:02.356
I was told that it was written on Indian airports,

01:03:02.381 --> 01:03:05.926
“Please don’t kiss the custom officers.”

01:03:39.121 --> 01:03:42.525
In modern times a man can kiss a woman,

01:03:42.629 --> 01:03:46.149
but he can’t kiss a man.
I mean, it’s absurd.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:24.593
Even if they make a goal in the match of football,

01:04:24.618 --> 01:04:32.230
now they don’t hug, poor things,
they just touch with hands, each other….

01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:34.684
they make a goal

01:04:34.957 --> 01:04:38.711
they don’t even hug each other....

01:05:08.788 --> 01:05:13.606
So, and now I’ve seen many people who make a goal

01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:15.791
and they’re excited, so they run out of the field.

01:05:15.815 --> 01:05:17.386
They don’t know what to do.

01:06:06.515 --> 01:06:09.853
So, for Sahaja Yogis,

01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:13.670
you should know men can kiss men
and can hug them

01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:14.695
there’s nothing wrong

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:17.054
and same with the ladies.

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:55.625
Otherwise, in excitement, they might
run out of the field of Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.173
Men need not touch women,
women not touch men. It’s all right.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.319
What is this nonsense?
You can’t express your love?

01:07:48.748 --> 01:07:57.602
Say for India we have a rule that
a lady can touch the younger man

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.427
and a man can touch a much older women,

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:06.584
who could be a mother, sister-in-law, anyone,

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:42.234
which I think is a good rule because it has worked out.

01:09:00.884 --> 01:09:03.130
So, for compassion,

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:10.007
it has to have decency as fragrance in the oil.

01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:39.866
So how do we express our compassion?

01:09:49.697 --> 01:09:53.292
We have Rakhi sisters, Rakhi brothers,

01:10:04.555 --> 01:10:06.862
but I know of a lady

01:10:06.887 --> 01:10:12.008
who became friendly with
rich boys as Rakhi brothers.

01:10:41.188 --> 01:10:45.060
Or the other way round also, that

01:10:45.119 --> 01:10:49.818
many boys became Rakhi sisters of rich women.

01:11:15.888 --> 01:11:20.106
So one has to understand that
it is not for money that

01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:24.441
you should become Rakhi brothers
and sisters and to exploit,

01:11:24.569 --> 01:11:27.453
but for compassion.

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:05.303
You have to express your Rakhi relationship

01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:08.608
just for the protection of each other.

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:33.557
The compassion is so joy-giving

01:12:33.565 --> 01:12:37.781
that you should have not such conditions of money

01:12:37.806 --> 01:12:43.938
or any other stupid conditions which will kill your joy.

01:13:15.737 --> 01:13:19.318
But another thing also is that

01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:26.443
you express your love you use
some things as presents

01:13:26.462 --> 01:13:30.144
that gives you joy.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:03.967
That doesn’t mean, by any chance,

01:14:04.057 --> 01:14:07.899
that you just give it to your Rakhi sister

01:14:07.934 --> 01:14:11.005
and not even to your wife, some present.

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:36.247
So, the sap, as I always say, of compassion has to rise

01:14:36.273 --> 01:14:42.556
in the plant, giving love to different parts,

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:45.488
indifferent ways, whatever is required

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:49.681
and that then evaporates

01:14:49.741 --> 01:14:53.391
or goes back resource.

01:15:21.703 --> 01:15:29.189
Attachment is the killer
of pure love and compassion.

01:15:46.029 --> 01:15:51.007
So try to always find out, introspect.

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.178
Are you attached  to your children, to your wife

01:15:54.219 --> 01:15:59.078
or to your Rakhi sister or to anything?
Attached?

01:15:59.552 --> 01:16:03.212
Then there’s a danger that

01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:07.492
you may get into a kind of a stagnation.

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:55.512
You’ll be amazed, when you are absolutely detached

01:16:55.854 --> 01:17:04.825
and nourishing the different relationships
that you have in a proper way,

01:17:05.325 --> 01:17:07.962
your joy is perfect.

01:17:40.214 --> 01:17:44.365
Ambition is another killer of joy.

01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:02.718
So, if you have to be ambitious,

01:18:02.727 --> 01:18:05.881
you have to be only ambitious only about Sahaja Yoga,

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.431
so that you humble down.

01:18:44.044 --> 01:18:52.310
One promise in Sahaja Yoga is
that your life will be full of joy.

01:19:16.959 --> 01:19:22.294
There is no need to take out your eyes,
cut your hands, no punishments.

01:19:38.825 --> 01:19:44.099
If you have too many holes,
need not come to Sahaj Yoga.

01:19:58.862 --> 01:20:03.774
You have to become real holy person,
not full of holes.

01:20:22.052 --> 01:20:26.409
I must say that you are all “your holinesses.”

01:20:42.574 --> 01:20:46.582
I am not because I’ve not become.
You have become.

01:20:55.929 --> 01:21:00.497
Supposing, somebody has to call you
as a man, will they say,

01:21:00.513 --> 01:21:06.191
“Oh, man, such and such”?
No, because you are a man.

01:21:36.404 --> 01:21:42.072
Whatever you achieve is attached to you,
whatever you have achieved.

01:22:04.179 --> 01:22:07.848
Russian seems to be long translation

01:22:11.812 --> 01:22:14.976
and sometimes very small

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:20.946
and sometimes Romanian sometimes very short,
sometimes very long.

01:22:32.717 --> 01:22:40.977
All right, so now the another thing
that is promised is bliss.

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:05.739
What is bliss is the experience of joy.

01:23:13.808 --> 01:23:16.609
It can come from anything.

01:23:33.838 --> 01:23:42.347
Maybe you find you were in an accident
and you were suddenly saved, protected.

01:23:42.507 --> 01:23:45.959
You are amazed and everybody feels the bliss.

01:23:45.984 --> 01:23:48.371
You also feel the bliss.

01:24:42.726 --> 01:24:45.519
To be very frank, I cannot translate.

01:24:47.167 --> 01:24:51.849
I know languages, but from one language
to another, I cannot translate.

01:24:51.884 --> 01:24:54.664
There’s something wrong with Me.

01:24:55.461 --> 01:25:00.280
Yogi: “But you understand very well,
Shri Mataji, what we say.”

01:25:15.213 --> 01:25:17.657
That is very easy.

01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:21.913
See the thoughts, first is an abstract form.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.496
That’s an abstract form,

01:25:39.504 --> 01:25:42.101
that’s all I said.

01:26:24.377 --> 01:26:28.845
All right, but thank you very much.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:35.296
So, it is — you see, at that point

01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:40.244
anybody can know what is the thought is

01:26:40.269 --> 01:26:45.616
because later on it becomes a language, takes words.

01:27:20.955 --> 01:27:26.058
All right, so if you can jump at that abstract,

01:27:26.151 --> 01:27:30.841
then you know that, but you have to
put attention quite a lot.

01:28:06.171 --> 01:28:11.162
So, you have to pay attention
"to that abstract point to continuous"

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:31.392
All right, so now, to solve this problem,

01:28:31.417 --> 01:28:35.347
I would request you all, to learn,
at least, English language.

01:28:45.686 --> 01:28:49.638
I’m not saying Sanskrit, but English.

01:29:12.787 --> 01:29:15.937
Now, it is the Kundalini,

01:29:16.001 --> 01:29:18.193
which is a pure desire,

01:29:18.202 --> 01:29:22.769
is already existing,
you don’t have to do anything.

01:29:43.454 --> 01:29:47.556
Maybe the cotton is not clean.

01:29:47.561 --> 01:29:51.021
It has some problems

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:57.709
because it has passed through dirty hands,

01:29:57.775 --> 01:30:01.935
but it can be clean.

01:30:03.588 --> 01:30:06.440
The cotton [UNCLEAR]

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.448
may not be clean

01:30:08.473 --> 01:30:11.052
but it can be clean

01:30:18.273 --> 01:30:20.391
Cotton wool, I mean.

01:30:49.191 --> 01:30:53.234
Kabira has said something very beautiful about it.

01:31:04.703 --> 01:31:11.053
He says that when the intestine

01:31:11.205 --> 01:31:15.949
of a goat are inside the stomach,

01:31:16.041 --> 01:31:21.620
they say, “May, may, may,” means “I, I, I.”

01:31:51.942 --> 01:31:57.355
But when they are pulled out and arevmade into strings

01:32:25.818 --> 01:32:34.497
and put on an instrument for
cleaning the cotton wool —

01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:40.348
put on the instrument that cleans the cotton wool.

01:32:40.374 --> 01:32:43.913
You know, in India we call it dhunakt ,dhunki.

01:33:18.016 --> 01:33:23.295
And when it is being strung, it  says, “Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi,”

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:27.315
means  “You, you are, you are, you are.”

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:33.578
All right, whatever it is.

01:34:33.706 --> 01:34:43.445
So, it means that when your Kundalini
not working out well

01:34:43.501 --> 01:34:48.114
because there are problems in your chakras,

01:34:48.139 --> 01:34:53.607
what you have to say,
“You are, you are.” You say that.

01:34:53.631 --> 01:34:57.604
“You are Sakshat this.
You are Sakshat that.”

01:35:32.317 --> 01:35:35.683
Sakshat means “in reality.” In reality.

01:35:54.046 --> 01:35:57.237
You don’t say, “You are Her Holiness something.”

01:35:57.294 --> 01:36:02.014
You say, “You are Ganesha. You are this.”

01:36:24.768 --> 01:36:29.924
That is how you cleanse all the dirt

01:36:30.012 --> 01:36:36.320
or all the problems of your chakras.

01:36:53.786 --> 01:37:00.350
By this, you also correct
your conditionings and your ego.

01:37:16.078 --> 01:37:20.498
Then you do not take the credit for anything.

01:37:20.598 --> 01:37:23.700
You do not feel you are doing something

01:37:42.871 --> 01:37:48.616
and the whole personality changes

01:37:48.641 --> 01:37:55.101
into a complete instrument like the flute

01:37:55.126 --> 01:37:59.087
in the hands of Shri Krishna.

01:38:24.349 --> 01:38:26.896
Then you see your work,

01:38:26.936 --> 01:38:32.091
everything as the work of the Divine.

01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:58.673
That is how you become enlightened.

01:39:05.136 --> 01:39:10.034
That is how you become the light of joy, of peace.

01:39:27.463 --> 01:39:31.295
What has been  said about what you are.

01:39:35.878 --> 01:39:41.163
That is how, see, is whatever is described about,

01:39:41.283 --> 01:39:43.826
you become that.

01:40:02.087 --> 01:40:05.023
If there is a light you don’t have to say

01:40:05.055 --> 01:40:08.834
that it is a light, it is.

01:40:29.734 --> 01:40:33.622
It is not a stamp that you have to use.

01:40:52.926 --> 01:41:01.207
So, today we are celebrating a Diwali
of the lights of Sahaja Yoga.

01:41:14.615 --> 01:41:21.569
I don’t know what to say,
in what state of bliss I am.

01:41:40.937 --> 01:41:49.067
All the ripples you have created
of joy are overwhelming for it.

01:42:23.322 --> 01:42:25.583
No words can describe.

01:42:25.707 --> 01:42:30.294
I cannot compose poetry.

01:42:41.899 --> 01:42:47.615
Keep this light burning beautifully through meditation

01:43:11.795 --> 01:43:17.241
and you can become very strong
because of light.

01:43:30.958 --> 01:43:35.443
May God bless you, Happy Diwali to all of you.

01:43:57.987 --> 01:44:01.455
I must say Diwali Puja is a very short one

01:44:01.487 --> 01:44:07.524
and my lecture have been three times said so

01:44:07.592 --> 01:44:13.689
you can imagine the time is been
more spend than normal.

01:44:38.999 --> 01:44:45.930
Lastly there are many invited in India free.

01:44:46.482 --> 01:44:51.469
Most of them may not also pay,

01:44:51.493 --> 01:44:55.981
those who cannot pay for travel should let us know.

01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:27.205
No no, we have invited many people to India.

01:45:27.261 --> 01:45:35.232
They should give their names and
those who are free for Ganapatipule

01:45:35.257 --> 01:45:38.450
but who have paid for the travelling

01:45:38.468 --> 01:45:42.925
and those who have not paid for travelling also should give their names.

01:46:24.765 --> 01:46:32.389
Also some of the letters who cannot paid are invited.

01:46:50.553 --> 01:46:52.354
May God bless you all.
