Shri Adi Shakti Puja
Cabella Ligure

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:15.709
June 24th, 2007

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.709
It is very nice to see you all again here.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:53.500
I think this is the first puja we are having in this place,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.875
and I hope you are all comfortable

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.875
and convenient for you to come here.

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:14.166
Today is really a very great day.

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:20.458
It's an Adi Shakti, to celebrate Adi Shakti

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:24.834
and what is the origin of this Adi Shakti.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.959
I've never talked about it.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.041
This is the first time I'll tell you

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:42.417
that Adi Shakti is the Primordial Mother,

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:50.625
is the power, power of God,

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:53.709
that wanted to create this world.

00:01:56.834 --> 00:02:04.417
And She Herself managed

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.333
to create this great world.

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:12.208
Can't you all sit down?

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:17.291
There's no space for them or what?

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:22.083
Please be seated.

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:27.166
Why are they standing?

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.875
There are chairs behind you.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.875
It's all right you can sit on chairs.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.542
This is all falling down [microphone].

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:24.125
As far as possible, be comfortable.

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:30.792
Don't strain yourself unnecessarily.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:38.625
I hope you all find

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.250
some place to be seated comfortably.

00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:58.417
So today I'm going to tell you about Adi Shakti

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.125
which is a very, very ancient subject.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.542
Adi Shakti is the power of God Himself,

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:20.667
and She created this world

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.959
to bring His kingdom on this Earth.

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:36.750
You can imagine, there was nothing but darkness.

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:39.750
And out of this darkness

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:49.750
She had to create all these beautiful,

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:55.500
pictures, trees

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.959
and all kinds of vegetation.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:04.875
That She did create.

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.792
But what is the use

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:11.792
having all these

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:18.959
things which do not speak, do not understand?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.750
There's no manifestation with them.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:36.583
Of course some of the trees and some of the flowers

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:46.667
do receive beautiful vibrations

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.250
and they grow very well,

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:59.458
but not all, some of them.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.250
For example I must tell you that here

00:06:07.542 --> 00:06:09.250
flowers have no fragrance,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.542
all the flowers they have no fragrance.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.875
I've been going round to see

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:27.500
if there were flowers of fragrance.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.375
But what they do is to grow them big.

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:40.875
They are very big, much bigger than you can find them anywhere.

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.583
But there is no fragrance.

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:50.583
While in a poor country like India,

00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:54.667
the flowers have tremendous fragrance.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:57.458
Even small flowers

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.834
have tremendous fragrance.

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:02.458
Now what is the speciality

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:10.041
of the fragrance in India

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.625
and nowhere else?

00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:14.333
Nowhere.

00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:19.125
Some flowers may be having little fragrance,

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:26.875
but if there is no fragrance in the flowers

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:33.875
that are grown so beautifully, full of love

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:42.000
and care but lots of wild flowers also India

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:44.041
have more fragrance.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:48.542
What is the reason?

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:55.417
They say that the soil of India has fragrance.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:08:00.000
How can you have fragrance in the soil?

00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:06.417
But it is a fact.

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:11.291
What I'm saying is not just
a story, but it's a fact

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:15.417
that in India any flower that you grow mostly,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.083
has mostly, has fragrance.

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:25.875
While here that's not the case.

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:30.667
Neither it is in any other country,

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:36.041
you go to Norway or you go to Germany,

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:39.333
any other country you go

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:44.458
you won't find any fragrance in the flowers.

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:55.250
It is very shocking why there is no fragrance in flowers.

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:08.458
When this world was created

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:13.250
there was no fragrance

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:19.417
but in some areas there was,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.417
specially areas

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:33.125
which we call as India and otherwise.

00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:40.417
It is unbelievable

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:46.083
that here  or anywhere abroad

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:49.792
there are no flowers with fragrance.

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:57.875
So now you are born here.

00:09:59.792 --> 00:10:02.583
You have brought the fragrance,

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:07.583
you are the people who are realized souls

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:11.917
and you have got the fragrance to spread.

00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:16.417
So your responsibility double, I think,

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:21.291
that you must spread fragrance.

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:27.417
Fragrance is something very innate.

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:34.417
Even this soil which we should say is without fragrance,

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:42.208
the people have fragrance in their character,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.959
in their behavior, in their understanding

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:52.166
and there is peace which they are aspiring.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.000
I don't say they are peaceful

00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:58.333
but they are aspiring to have peace.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.709
This aspiration only suggests

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.417
they are fragrant people,

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:06.709
that they are very fragrant.

00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:12.542
What is a fragrance in a human being is

00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:15.542
his nature, his temperament,

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:22.375
how he is and how he behaves towards others.

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.709
All the countries all over

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:35.291
still not aware that you have to become fragrant.

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:43.500
If they were to be aware

00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:48.417
then all wars will end, everything will finish off

00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:50.625
and they will know we are all one.

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:54.208
We do not belong to different countries

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.583
or anything which we have made.

00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:59.667
God has not made France.

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:04.583
We have made that this is your country, this is their country

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:07.458
and country-wise we fight.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.959
This country belongs to no one.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.041
This belongs to God.

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:19.750
But people stupidly fight

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.166
on the countries that,
"This is our country, this is our country."

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:30.083
Now I have traveled all over the world,

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:35.333
I wouldn't say any, any, any country as their own,

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:41.250
because if you own a country

00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:44.834
you should have fragrance,

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:48.542
you should have temperament

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:53.041
which will make other people

00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:59.083
feel that you come from countries of fragrance.

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.583
Won't have to argue.

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.792
But one country fighting with another country,

00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:10.875
everywhere it goes on.

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:15.583
You read in the newspaper all the time you see this nonsense,

00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:18.834
that countries are fighting

00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:23.500
and the more they are developed, better they are.

00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:27.834
In this development of theirs I hope they

00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:31.500
rise and become spiritual

00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:35.542
and they develop fragrance.

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:40.959
But this fighting spirit

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.333
of human beings has come from satan I think,

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:49.959
that they are killing themselves, killing others,

00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:52.875
destroying the whole world.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.709
You read newspaper you feel so ashamed

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:00.458
how human beings are going on.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.375
So all the Sahaja yogis should not support any kind of fight.

00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:15.500
Theirs not, they are here to bring fragrance to people,

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:21.083
to bring happiness, to joy and not to fight.

00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:25.583
That is one of the first duties of Sahaja yogis,

00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:29.625
not to join anything which hates,

00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:33.125
which fights, which creates problems.

00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:39.333
These fighting spirits have destroyed the fragrance of the soil.

00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:49.792
If people become loving and affectionate,

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:57.208
this soil itself will become fragrant.

00:14:58.792 --> 00:15:03.291
First thing we must learn is to love each other

00:15:04.792 --> 00:15:07.083
and not to hate anyone.

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:11.583
There are so many ways of hating,

00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:14.458
this also human quality.

00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:19.792
Animals do hate because they are animals.

00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:25.625
Human beings can't be animals.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.041
We are human beings and as human beings

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:33.375
what we should have is love,

00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:38.875
affection and no hatred of any kind.

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:42.500
Now as you are Sahaja yogis

00:15:42.792 --> 00:15:46.709
I would say that you should try

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.417
to develop your loving capacity

00:15:50.709 --> 00:15:56.709
instead of fighting capacity or criticizing others.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:59.625
Very easy to criticize.

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:06.250
But try to understand that our soil itself has no fragrance.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.000
How are we to bring fragrance to this soil?

00:16:11.291 --> 00:16:14.291
This is only if people live here,

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:20.000
have affection and love for each other.

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:23.542
This is the most important thing.

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:30.458
When creation took place it was only through affection.

00:16:31.709 --> 00:16:35.333
Otherwise, what was the need for nature

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:37.417
to create all these things?

00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:39.792
All this is for what?

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.375
To make you feel beautiful,

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:47.375
all these trees are beautiful

00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:49.875
to make you feel good,

00:16:50.208 --> 00:16:54.792
to feel one with the nature.

00:16:56.083 --> 00:17:02.875
In that way we human beings have not contributed.

00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:05.709
Now I'm not saying Sahaja yogis,

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:09.792
they are rare and they are wonderful

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:12.125
and they have done a good job

00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:15.709
because they consider love is the highest.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.709
But you have to show others also

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:28.500
that you want to love them because
they should love each other.

00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:33.542
The whole world is created because

00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:34.917
there was love,

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.625
otherwise what was the need to waste energy

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:43.333
on these continents and all these different countries?

00:17:45.417 --> 00:17:51.125
Was not to fight, was not to hate each other

00:17:51.458 --> 00:17:53.834
or to think no end of yourself;

00:17:54.125 --> 00:18:00.041
but to love each other, to have more brothers and sisters.

00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:02.875
As in Sahaja Yoga you feel that way,

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:06.375
you have brothers and sisters all over.

00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:08.458
Today when I was coming

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:15.667
I was so happy to see there were people from all over Europe

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:17.542
and also from India.

00:18:17.834 --> 00:18:20.041
How is it possible?

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:25.041
Because you have developed that love,

00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:30.750
because you have that love, that innate love,

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:33.417
so wherever you go,

00:18:33.709 --> 00:18:36.208
wherever you meet people

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.000
they should say that we have seen Sahaja yogis

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.291
who are nothing but love.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.709
They are not bothered as to

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.583
what you are, what your position is

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:54.083
or anything, they only know that you are a Sahaja yogi

00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:56.959
and a Sahaja yogi loves other Sahaja
yogis.

00:18:57.291 --> 00:19:00.083
This is a very big achievement.

00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:05.375
It was never there as there is no fragrance in the soil,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.250
no fragrance in the human beings.

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:12.750
Now that has come.

00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:18.333
Now you have got the capacity to love each other

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:23.083
and to help each other and to understand each other.

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:31.166
Not to criticise and not to insult or in any way defame them.

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:34.542
This I am saying

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:38.166
because you are all rare people who are Sahaja yogis.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.709
How many people there are Sahaja yogis you see?

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:50.125
Very few. We have to have more Sahaja yogis

00:19:50.417 --> 00:19:52.500
that they understand

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:56.709
that we are all part and parcel of one country

00:19:57.041 --> 00:19:59.750
and that country is of love.

00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:02.750
This, when it happens

00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:05.750
then we'll say that Sahaja Yoga has worked out.

00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:09.834
Helping each other,
understanding each other,

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.125
that should be there,

00:20:12.125 --> 00:20:16.542
and I think Sahaja yogis do understand each other

00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:18.458
and they love each other,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:24.000
but still it should go more than their limits.

00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:28.667
Many people don't understand

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:31.667
that Sahaja Yoga is not for them only;

00:20:31.959 --> 00:20:33.667
it is for the whole world.

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:36.542
You have to give it to others

00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:42.959
and you have to bring forth what you call unity of love.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.542
In love you don't see wrong things.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.750
You just enjoy love

00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:59.834
and that is what is to be seen in today's puja,

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:06.583
is that do we bear any hatred for anyone?

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:14.500
Do we have ill feeling for anyone or for any country?

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.041
We should try to examine yourself.

00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:23.041
If you are a real Sahaja yogi

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:27.917
you'll hate no one, you'll hate no one,

00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:34.625
but you will love and love as your own.

00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:39.959
Love is the biggest thing that God has given human beings

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:46.458
and that is what one has to try to develop it.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:54.250
I'm so happy here, now you have come all the way

00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:58.959
to celebrate this first day,

00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:11.625
first day of your growth as Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja yogis.

00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:15.125
Now if the Sahaja yogis

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:19.542
spread out and become Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yogis,

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:24.875
then your job is finished

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:30.667
because then you are enjoying the joy of oneness.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
So one has to do it in a way that we all become one.

00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:43.333
There is nothing to criticize or to hate anyone

00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:47.709
but to love each other is the point

00:22:48.083 --> 00:22:52.750
and there I find there are so many Sahaja yogis

00:22:53.083 --> 00:22:56.750
who have achieved that loving level

00:22:57.083 --> 00:23:03.583
and there are some still who are struggling,

00:23:03.875 --> 00:23:10.875
they haven't come up to that level, some, not many.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.917
Sahaja Yoga means we are one,

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:21.542
we are all Sahaja yogis, but not separately, together.

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:26.750
If one understands this fact,

00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:32.333
you have celebrated today's great day of Adi Shakti.

00:23:33.083 --> 00:23:36.208
Why did Adi Shakti create this world?

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.208
Why did all this happen?

00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:49.083
Why don't we think why so much of love,

00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:54.500
so much of prosperity has been given to us?

00:23:55.792 --> 00:24:01.500
We never realize where are we and how much we have got.

00:24:01.834 --> 00:24:05.834
It's not the money but the love

00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:10.041
and when you will understand we'll really love each other

00:24:10.375 --> 00:24:12.291
and there is no hatred,

00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:16.500
there is no revenge, nothing

00:24:16.792 --> 00:24:20.291
but just love and love and love.

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:24.125
This is what is the message of today.

00:24:25.417 --> 00:24:28.417
We all have to be loving each other.

00:24:29.709 --> 00:24:36.625
We have to have all kinds of rituals

00:24:36.917 --> 00:24:42.333
but it is only expression of our love.

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:49.667
It's not just a ritual, it is love.

00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:55.750
When you have love of the Mother how do you express?

00:24:56.083 --> 00:24:58.583
In the same way

00:24:58.834 --> 00:25:02.834
we have to know that today we have to promise

00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:06.458
that for us love is the most important.

00:25:06.792 --> 00:25:10.083
We should love.

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:13.291
People don't even love in their own families.

00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:17.583
I'm not talking to such people,  I know.

00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:22.000
They love their own families, their own village,

00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:24.041
their all surroundings, everywhere.

00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:28.959
But still the world is going on with wars,

00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:31.875
fighting and all kinds of troubles.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.625
The whole world has to come up

00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:38.834
to love each other.

00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:42.834
There is no other solution

00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:48.166
but to love and in that love there is no selfishness

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:55.959
but enjoyment, and that enjoyment you should feel

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.625
and give it to others.

00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:03.125
I'm sure you all Sahaja yogis are doing that

00:26:03.417 --> 00:26:07.125
and you are seeing the mistakes

00:26:07.417 --> 00:26:15.542
of the others and not to get anybody into trouble.

00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:22.250
Love is the message of Adi Shakti.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.333
Now you think about it,

00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:28.417
one Adi Shakti created the whole world.

00:26:28.709 --> 00:26:31.709
How She must have done it,

00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:35.667
what She must have planned,

00:26:36.959 --> 00:26:39.959
how She must have organised it.

00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:45.458
It's not easy thing. Only because She loved.

00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:50.792
Her love is the expression that you are all there

00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:56.959
and that is why to be one with Her, one should learn to love.

00:26:57.291 --> 00:27:00.417
Of course in that you have to know

00:27:00.709 --> 00:27:03.417
that you should forgive.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.458
If you don't know how to forgive

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.959
and find mistakes of other people, you won't help.

00:27:12.291 --> 00:27:15.583
What is your now job is,

00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.709
is to see that you are loving,

00:27:18.959 --> 00:27:21.709
that there is no hatred for anyone,

00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:26.250
you don't think of hating someone or hitting somebody.

00:27:26.542 --> 00:27:28.959
This has to work out.

00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:32.542
I'm sure this will work out.

00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:42.250
In all the European countries and Indian continent,

00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:49.542
those who are developed are fighting;

00:27:49.625 --> 00:27:53.542
those who are not developed are fighting,

00:27:53.834 --> 00:27:57.125
they have their own style of fighting.

00:27:57.417 --> 00:27:59.750
That's the only difference.

00:28:00.083 --> 00:28:02.250
But there is no love.

00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:09.250
If you want to have love, then you feel sorry.

00:28:10.625 --> 00:28:14.709
Supposing I see some country hates country,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.709
then it is very easy for Me to criticize

00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:22.959
that this country is very bad, the people are bad,

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.250
this is bad,  that is ...

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:31.125
but I think potentially they are all fine and

00:28:31.417 --> 00:28:36.917
very good people. Somehow or other I should be able

00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:40.083
to make them understand that.

00:28:40.417 --> 00:28:46.500
If they understand what is love and enjoy love,

00:28:46.834 --> 00:28:50.000
there will be no problems of any kind.

00:28:51.291 --> 00:28:54.291
Only human beings know how to love.

00:28:54.583 --> 00:28:56.583
Nobody else.

00:28:56.917 --> 00:29:01.500
Animals also love but their love is so limited.

00:29:01.834 --> 00:29:06.625
But human beings, their love is so beautiful.

00:29:06.917 --> 00:29:10.625
They look beautiful only when they love.

00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:15.250
So I have to tell you not to make cheap love,

00:29:15.542 --> 00:29:20.250
but a love that you will enjoy

00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:23.792
and that another person will also enjoy.

00:29:24.083 --> 00:29:26.792
It's something to be understood.

00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:33.458
The way people understand love is sometimes very ridiculous.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:39.041
So one has to first understand what is love,

00:29:39.417 --> 00:29:45.125
also to understand whether you love or not.

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:49.500
If you really love the world,

00:29:49.834 --> 00:29:54.125
if you really love this creation of God,

00:29:54.417 --> 00:29:57.917
then there should be no hatred,

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.750
there should be no fights,

00:30:02.041 --> 00:30:04.834
but just to see the good points.

00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:08.458
As a mother would see her child,

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.458
you should see the whole world

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:17.000
as a beautiful peace that God has created for you.

00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:23.625
This subject is so lengthy that I can talk to you for hours

00:30:23.917 --> 00:30:26.500
but I have to just say that

00:30:26.834 --> 00:30:31.834
if you can understand little bit of it is this:

00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:35.041
you all should have love for each other

00:30:36.333 --> 00:30:39.750
and we should have understanding.

00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:43.834
Look at the small children. They love each other.

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:49.291
They haven't learned yet how to hate.

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:54.166
But if the children are not brought up well

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.792
they can hate each other.

00:30:59.583 --> 00:31:04.500
They can be very ridiculously funny,

00:31:04.792 --> 00:31:08.792
and so many countries today are like that.

00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:14.667
They are just fighting because they do not love.

00:31:15.917 --> 00:31:20.709
Now so Sahaja yogis have a much greater job,

00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:27.333
much greater life that they have to show

00:31:27.667 --> 00:31:30.375
that love is a very great thing.

00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:32.458
It doesn't matter

00:31:32.792 --> 00:31:39.875
whether you are Hindu, Christian, this, that nonsense,

00:31:41.208 --> 00:31:44.709
you are all human beings

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:47.583
and we have a right to love

00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:48.583
and if you manage somehow to love people,

00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:58.959
I tell you Sahaja Yoga will settle down.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:03.875
Sahaja Yoga is like a tree

00:32:04.166 --> 00:32:09.166
which requires love as the water.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.208
Try this, try around your life,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:21.583
and you'll find that how love pays itself.

00:32:21.959 --> 00:32:26.959
Not to be seen by how much you spend

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.834
or what you do.

00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:31.667
It's not that you count all those things,

00:32:31.959 --> 00:32:39.959
it's just like a ocean floats everything around,

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:46.458
you become like that, a typical personality of Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:50.792
So all the Sahaja yogis must decide today

00:32:51.125 --> 00:32:55.000
that we are going to forgive all the people we hate

00:32:55.291 --> 00:32:58.500
and we are going to love all of them.

00:32:58.792 --> 00:33:01.500
Let us see if it works out.

00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:04.291
I'm sure it will work out

00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:07.417
because first of all you are all realized souls

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:14.458
and secondly love is the biggest, biggest boon on human beings,

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.166
which, if you utilize,

00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:21.041
there will be no problem of any kind.

00:33:27.583 --> 00:33:29.458
So thank you very much.
