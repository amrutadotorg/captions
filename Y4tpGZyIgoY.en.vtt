00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.000
Today we have assembled here

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.040
to do Shri Buddha Puja.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.920
I don't know how many of you have read of Buddha's life

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.520
and how ultimately He achieved His enlightenment.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.760
I don't know how many of you have really

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.000
seen the Buddhists

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.520
or have met them,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.360
those who call themselves Buddhist.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.680
As in every religion,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.160
all of them got lost into some sort of a fundamentalism,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.640
because none of them got realization.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.560
And that's why everybody established their own style

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.760
of religion, even, you can say that

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.920
Tao of Lao-Tse also,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.400
or Zen of Viditama, all of them are

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.400
all fruits of the same.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.320
We have to see how

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.000
He first felt that

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.640
one has to seek something beyond life.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Once we are very much satisfied with whatever we have

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.760
because He was a king's son, He had a very nice wife,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.680
He had a son

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.320
and naturally, anybody in that position would be quite satisfied.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.040
But He saw a very sick man one day,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.080
He saw a beggar, and also He saw a dead man

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.240
and everybody crying for that dead person.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.360
He couldn't understand how this misery has come

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.920
and what is the need to have this misery.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.160
So He gave up His family,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.320
He gave up His luxuries of life,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.040
everything He gave up, and went in search of the truth,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.640
as many of you have done.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.800
He would have been lost also, I would say,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.680
because He read all the Upanishads,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.360
and He read all the books that were possible,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.480
for Him to say what is the truth is.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.800
But He couldn't get anything.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000
He took a complete sanyasa, in the sense,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.280
as far as the food is concerned,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.160
as far as entertainment is concerned,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.000
everything He gave up.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.360
And ultimately, He was lying under a banyan tree,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.040
and suddenly

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.760
the Adishakti gave Him realization

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.600
because He was so true and was

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.920
one of the one marked

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.520
for a special place in the Virata.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.240
He had to achieve that.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.880
Of course, I need not tell you about His previous lives, perhaps,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.080
in so many of My lectures I have already talked about it,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.760
what was His previous life

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.760
and how He achieved His own enlightenment about Himself.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.640
But what we have to see from His life is that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.240
He discovered and He found out

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.240
that want is the reason;

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.000
the desire is the reason, of all the miseries.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.720
But He didn't know, what was the real want?

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.840
What was the pure want?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.120
What was the pure desire?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.720
And that's how He could not explain to people

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.600
that they have to take to their awakening through their kundalini.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.880
As He had followed such an

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.200
ascetic life

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.280
that became the code for the Buddhists.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.040
The other day I was reading about Buddha when I was in Thailand

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.040
and I was surprised

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.360
that the bhikkus, that means the bhikku is

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.960
actually in Sanskrit it means bhikshyus,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.160
is the one who asks for alms,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.000
or a beggar you can call it – but religious beggar.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.680
So, He used to carry thousands of people with Him,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.080
at least minimum of thousand

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.240
bare feet, without any

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.600
provision for food,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.560
without any arrangements for stay, nothing,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.520
and they were supposed to shave off their heads completely,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.440
no moustaches, no hair on the body at all.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.000
Moreover, they were supposed to wear only one dress.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.360
One long dress they had to tie up like this

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.640
and cover themselves,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.040
whether it was cold season

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.640
or it was a warm season, whatever it was.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.160
They were not allowed to sing or to dance,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.880
or to entertain themselves, by anything.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.400
And food was just collected

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.920
from the village, whatever they visited,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.720
whatever they got, very minimum.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.080
Whatever they got,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.600
it was cooked for them

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.720
and they would offer their guru first and then eat that food.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.800
Imagine thousand people going like that,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.000
bare feet, in the scorching heat

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.160
or in the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.960
mud,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.080
or in rain. In all seasons they used to walk,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.200
giving up all their family relationships.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.800
Even if the husband and wife both of them joined the sangha,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.080
then they were not supposed to live like husband and wife.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.040
So, to give up all other physical wants,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.360
mental wants, emotional wants

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.040
was the way they tried to follow, because He said the want creates it.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.000
But if you see the Buddhists,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.200
they do all these things.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.000
You’ll be amazed even if he is a king, he does that.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.600
And many kings who joined at that time,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.600
one of them was Ashoka, from India.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.560
He dressed up like that, he became like that,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.880
he started traveling in the same manner

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.240
and tried to lead a complete ascetic life.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.520
Very difficult life it was and they thought

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.160
that by doing all that, they will achieve their realization.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.640
They say that two of His disciples did achieve,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.560
their names are Moggallana and Sariputta.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.200
These two people got their realization.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.680
But the whole thing was absolutely a life,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.240
dry and insipid,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.760
had no fun either,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
no children were allowed,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.760
no family life was allowed.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.720
So it became a very secluded, very harsh,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.400
I can say, very dry life.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.000
Though it was called as a sangha, means the collectivity;

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.640
but in that collectivity

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.920
there was no rapport as such

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.840
because they were not supposed to talk too much,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.800
they were not supposed to

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.520
discuss anything about, say, politics

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.800
or economics or anything.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.960
Only they could talk about meditation,

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.520
of achieving the highest life.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.320
So you can imagine

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.040
what sort of life they had to lead

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.880
to become enlightened.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.400
And that idea continued in so many [places],

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.800
religions,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.600
specially,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.640
it then started making people

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.280
take away the money of the householders

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.720
by saying that you have to give up everything.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.360
Of course, at the time of Buddha also,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.320
they had to give up everything and join the sangha,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.720
but here it was a genuine effort of Buddha

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.800
to take them to enlightenment,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.280
to make them people who were

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.040
knowledgeable about the absolute realities.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.280
But it did not happen, and that is the reason why

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.000
we find that Buddhists have gone

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.600
into different types of funny Buddhism.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.880
For example, now we have some Buddhism, say in Japan,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.920
where it was not allowed to kill any animal.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.000
So, they said, “All right, we are not killing any animal

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.960
but we can eat killed animals,” you see.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.680
They found out a solution out of that.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.200
Then also, then they can

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.480
they could kill human beings, because

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.920
it’s not allowed to kill animals, but we can kill human beings.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.320
So Japanese become experts in killing human beings, you see.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.840
How people find out loopholes, you can see this very clearly.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.520
Then the second type of Buddhism came,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.560
where this Lao-Tse taught about Tao.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.320
But Tao actually is

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.080
He’s the only one who started talking about Kundalini.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.160
Tao is the Kundalini.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.240
But, that too, was too much for these people.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.120
They just couldn't understand what He was talking about.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.440
But the way He expressed Himself in paintings,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.120
and other things, just to deviate

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.200
from that kind of a harsh Buddhism.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.200
But somehow, despite that,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.000
it never took proper roots,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.320
and I have met people who follow Tao

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.680
and absolutely you don't understand

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.840
how these people are following

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.200
the path of Kundalini.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.800
There's a river called Yangtze by which when you travel,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.120
you find variety of things.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.400
After every five minutes, the scene changes,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.040
all the beautiful mountains take another form,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.320
and you have lots of waterfalls, and it’s very interesting.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.800
That is the Kundalini.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.200
Tao is that river.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.880
But it’s said that you should not divert your attention

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.200
to these temptations which are outside.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.840
You should see them, but move.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.400
And that is what is Tao, which He brought in,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.000
but they got lost because they started painting all those things and

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.760
doing all kinds of, more into art.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.000
Basically, Buddha never thought of any art,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.080
He never wanted to have any art,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.480
and He didnt want to do anything with art, He said,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.640
but only thing is that you have to

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.840
introspect and go within, and deep down,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.880
and find out what is the absolute truth.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.080
So the whole thing started deviating like this.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.360
Then this Zen system was the same, as mixed up with Kundalini,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.760
which Viditama, one of His great disciples, who started in Japan.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.400
Now, the Zen system is

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.000
that they used to put, I mean sometimes hit also,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.040
on the back of

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.960
the – what you call – spinal cord, on the chakras

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.000
and they would try to raise the kundalini,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.960
all kinds of horrible things.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.920
In the Zen system, they developed very harsh methods

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.640
of raising the Kundalini.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.040
It went to such a limit that

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.920
I have met people who have broken their spinal cords,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.080
then Kundalini will never rise in any case if the spinal cord …

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.320
… please pay attention here.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.880
One lady walks out then attention goes out.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.400
I mean, if your attention is so poor ...

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.040
Please pay attention here, do you understand that?

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.800
If one person walks out, your attention should not go

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.400
and please don't come inside to disturb.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.400
You see, the trouble is we must understand

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.480
that our attention has to be steady.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.680
Any lady walks out if your attention moves out

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.600
then understand that you have to meditate more.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.840
Please keep the attention.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.040
So now, then this Viditama Zen

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.880
also took a very different form.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.800
I met one of the head of the Viditama Zen system,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.000
and I was surprised because – they called Me because he was very sick,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.360
so they said that “Mother, please help him to cure.”

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.960
But I found he was not at all a realized soul

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.400
and did not know a word about Kundalini.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.600
So I said, “How are you the head,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.000
how is it that you have become the head when you do not know

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.680
the meaning of Kundalini?”

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.360
So he said, “What is Kundalini?”

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.320
He couldn't understand anything.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.080
I said, “What is Zen?”

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.800
Zen is to meditate, dhyana.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.480
I said, “All right, but what about it?”

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.840
“Yes, yes there is.”

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.520
I mean so confused he was.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.560
Then I asked him, “You are not a realized soul,

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.280
then how is it you are the head?”

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.000
He said, “We never had any realized soul

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.840
for now, ages.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.440
Only for six centuries we had some kashayapas –

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.880
they call them kashayapas.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.480
And after that we had no realized souls at all.”

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.000
So, just think,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.960
under what circumstances you got your realization.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.120
Without sacrificing anything,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.920
without giving up anything,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.880
without working out any one of these

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.440
tapasyas – penances.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.400
Because Buddha is the Tapa.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.400
These three Deities on your Agnya Chakra:

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.440
Christ, Mahavira and Buddha.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.920
Three of them are Tapa.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.800
Tapa means penance.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.920
You have to do penance;

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.720
and penance, now in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.240
doesn't mean that you give up your wife

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.080
or give up your husband, give up your children, give up your family.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.080
But here Tapa means meditation.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.280
And for meditation, you must know when to get up,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.240
that should be the most important thing for a Sahaja Yogi.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.360
The rest of the things automatically will work out,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.640
and you'll understand.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.120
To grow your depth you have to meditate,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.200
is a absolutely simple thing.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.200
You don't have to shave your head,

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.120
you don't have to starve yourself,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.880
you don't have to walk bare feet,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.080
you can sing, you can dance,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.040
I mean, you can entertain yourself with music.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.200
There, you are not even allowed to see a drama,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.560
or a play, or anything like that.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.480
I mean, so many things if you see the list,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.760
you'd go really crazy, how could people exist?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.640
But there were thousand peoples with Him,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.800
who were traveling with Him

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.480
and they became so poor, they were just wearing rags.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.560
Ultimately, a big

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.840
trader was passing by

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.400
and he saw them and he thought,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.880
“What poor people these are, just beggars.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.160
God knows they are lepers or what are they?”

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.480
And he had a great feeling for them.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.400
And he gave them some food to eat

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.920
and everything and still he did not know that it was the tathāgata -

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.520
means it was "Buddha who was going".

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.680
So Buddha's main thing,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.280
Buddha itself means bodh,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.240
from bodha, and the bodh means:

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.440
to know the reality on your central nervous system

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.960
is the bodha.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.240
You all have become now Buddhas,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.360
without giving up anything

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.560
because whatever He gave up was all nonsense.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.520
It was a myth.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.920
If it was a myth, what's the use of giving up the myth?

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.760
What does it matter if you listen to music,

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.680
what does it matter if you dance, it doesn't matter at all.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.240
But these ideas went so deep into these people

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.760
that you really feel such pity and such compassion

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.160
that look at them, where are they getting lost?

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.520
They don't eat their food,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.600
they have their food only once in a while

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.360
and they are starving, they look like really worse than TB patients.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600
But while you people look like really roses,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.280
beautifully all of you are enjoying life and everything is there.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.800
But still one has to know that

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.600
we have to have that principle of Buddha within ourselves.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.840
And what is that principle of Buddha,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.320
is that we have to do tapa.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.640
Tapa doesn't mean -I don't say - you starve yourself.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.960
But also if you have too much interest in food,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.960
is better to take to little fasting.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.200
I never said that you should not enjoy music, never.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.880
No question, you should.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.240
But then you should enjoy music which is for your emancipation,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.000
for your awakening, for your ascent.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.640
I don't say don't do, because yourself now you are a Buddha.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.120
Buddha was not to be told anything,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.040
He told everyone, but He was not to be told.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.960
In the same way, I don't have to tell you.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.800
It is only you have to understand.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.360
But sometimes we are really bound by so many conditionings

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.080
that I find very difficult for people

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.840
to understand what is the spirit.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.080
Spirit is boundless.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:05.240
It is a free expression of God's love.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.320
So, when it comes to the free expression of God's love,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.440
the compassion, the love,

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.960
then one has to understand, do we do that or not?

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.360
Even now there are many conditionings which are still working in us.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.200
For example, some of you are like this

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.160
that “I belong to this nationality, to that nationality,

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.080
I am this, I am that.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.680
We are very proud of that.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.240
We cannot mix up with other people,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.520
we are too high for the other people."

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.680
Or something like that.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.480
You are now become a universal being.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.000
So, you – how can you have these stupid limitations

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.040
which are mythical again.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.960
So, one must see, introspect and find out

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.760
if you are having

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.800
what's the matter with her, take her away

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.680
Also with your children, you must see, you see,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.680
very important how they behave,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.000
if they are aggressive or how they behave.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.480
Is very important because they are also Buddhas,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.080
they are also realized souls.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.760
But they have certain conditionings in them

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.560
and they are behaving according to those conditioning.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.800
Now as it is, we can see there is light within us.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.400
What happens that we start seeing

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.600
what's wrong with us and we just drop it out.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.840
But even when you see that,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.480
if you cannot drop it out then must know that you need

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.760
more of power.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.760
Then you must learn how to raise your kundalini,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.080
how to be connected with the

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.040
divine Power all the time,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.280
so that you are in thoughtless awareness

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.240
and that you grow within yourself in a depth.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:04.240
I find the conditioning that is very much lurking still

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.360
is “my and mine”

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.920
in, still in Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.640
Like before this what I had heard about,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.840
say English or all Western people,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.720
because I am talking to the Western people here,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.400
that they didn't care for their family, their wives, their children,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.960
every third day they were divorcing, or fourth day

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.400
they are running off with some other husbands or something like that.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.040
Now I find they stick, like glue.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.160
Wife becomes very important, husband becomes very important.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.200
My house becomes very important,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.200
my children become very important,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.400
and first they were not interested in children,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.880
now they are sticking on to children like,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.960
as if with some glue.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.760
It's impossible for them to tell that, see

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.360
children belong to the sangha, to the collectivity.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.160
You don't think this is your child.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.160
Once you start thinking like that, then you are limiting yourself

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.600
and getting into problems.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.000
The country-wise also

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.280
the problems are reducing very much, I should say.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.360
Also we are, we don't like to be racist,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.560
I know people hate those who are racist,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.080
they want racialism to go away.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.840
As in India, I’ve seen, Sahaja Yogis want

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.840
all the caste system must go away.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.800
Because these are self-destructive.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.600
So we start seeing in ourselves what is self-destructive.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.000
What will destroy me;

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.800
then what will destroy my family;

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.720
then what will destroy my country and what will destroy the whole world?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.520
All these

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.160
ventures which are just the opposite

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.320
of your constructive life,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.800
you start seeing, you see your derailment,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.080
you see you are going towards destruction,

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.440
and you can stop it

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.120
and that is very important.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.880
Only possible if you try

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.040
to introspect yourself and meditate

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.560
and see, have I got this quality?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.800
Some of them are very proud of their certain temperaments,

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.960
like “I am like this, what to do Mother? I am like this.”

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.920
No more.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.240
Now all your beautiful qualities have been awakened by your Kundalini.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.320
Shows that nothing was dead, nothing was finished,

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.280
they were all there intact

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.480
and when the Kundalini started rising,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.800
she just awakened all those beautiful qualities.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:43.040
Apart from that, in the Guru Puja, I'll tell you what all has happened.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.000
Of course, you must have seen in Sahashrara Puja, I told you about yourself,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.320
that what you have achieved, you have no idea as to what powers you have got.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.480
But in Guru Puja, I'll definitely tell you

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.880
what is the thing that

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.560
is Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.280
It's one of the most

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.880
precious thing, that a human being should have known, long time back.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.800
It is not only talking about God,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.320
it is not only saying there's divinity within you

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.400
but the effectiveness of that.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.520
So you don't need any science,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.240
you have any problem, all right, give a bandhan, finished.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.840
So simple.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.680
If you want anything, just give a bandhan, it’s finished.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.400
You want to give realization, you raise that much.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.080
That’s kundalini is raised.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.280
Everything that you can do with science, you can do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.400
We are also computers.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.880
Sometimes I say something, you say “Mother, how do You know?”

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.360
I say, “I am a computer, no doubt.”

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.800
But you all are computers,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.040
only thing you have to develop your depth.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.400
Now you are on the right lines,

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.640
so we don't need this science which can destroy all of us.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.480
Everything can be done through Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.800
And this is what I'll explain to you in Guru Puja –

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
how you become so capable.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.000
So, please have self-esteem.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.880
You must have self-esteem and understand that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.200
First and foremost, you are a Sahaja Yogi

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.400
and as Sahaja Yogi, you have to achieve that state

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.840
where you become absolutely capable

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.520
of doing whatever science can do,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.400
whatever anybody could do,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.400
this is the real siddhi,

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:49.920
means you become a embodiment of all the powers.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.000
There's some people who come and tell Me,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.480
“Mother, We can’t open our heart.”

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.600
I mean I don't say you have an open heart surgery.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.680
But to “open my heart” means

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.400
just see what's wrong with you.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.680
Can't you feel compassion?

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.080
But I’ve seen people having an open heart for a dog, or for a cat.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.480
But they don't have open heart for their children sometimes.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.040
Now how can you not have open heart in Sahaja Yoga?

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.480
That's the first place where the spirit exists

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.440
and it emits its light and when it emits its light,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.400
that's the first place where you see the life

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.360
of a person who is full of love.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.160
So, how can it be, there is

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.320
this problem that “I can't open my heart.”

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.600
This must be coming because

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.640
you have only ego but no self-esteem.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.200
So, Buddha is the one who is the killer of ego.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.200
He's the killer of ego.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.480
He is, as you have seen it,

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.480
He is moving on your

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.640
Pingala Nadi

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.720
and comes and then settles down on this side,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.800
the left side.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.240
He's the one who is the controller of our ego,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.280
and how He has tried

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.520
to compensate this right side.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.440
First of all, you must have seen the laughing Buddha.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.000
He’s very fat,

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.560
and a person who is right-sided is very thin,

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.200
is never laughing, never smiles even.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.960
Even if you tickle, he may not.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.760
So, they have shown Buddha as a person,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.040
He'll have many children sitting on His stomach, all over His body

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.160
and everywhere, and He’ll be laughing.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.880
So, just see how they have shown the compensation

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.640
of Buddha, the one

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.960
who is the controller of our right side.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.600
So, how He controls our right side, just laughs out and out.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.120
He makes fun of Himself,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.480
He makes fun of everything.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.160
Anything they see – for example, now

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.600
as He said, “Don't see any drama.” All right.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.920
I say, “You see every drama.”

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.840
But in that you see with your enlightened consciousness,

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.080
you can see the stupidity of it and enjoy the stupidity.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.760
For example, this Elizabeth lady

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.760
was married eight times, or something – nine,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
I don't know how many times she was married, I’ve lost count.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.880
So these stupid people went there,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.200
three, four thousand, imagine, more than you people,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.480
were standing around,

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.160
and there were helicopters

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.880
who were sending parachutes, you see,

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.800
down, and everybody was so much enamored

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.480
and the parachuters were falling on the trees,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.120
sometimes falling on the people.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.760
And it was all in the newspaper,

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.760
a big news for these Americans, you see.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.560
So, you should see the stupidity of that.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.480
If you could see the stupidity,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.760
then it's all right.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
But if you become one of those spectators

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.360
and think, “Oh, what a thing is that ...

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.480
what a luck that I have been able to see this lady,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.120
such an inauspicious person,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.240
going for her honeymoon.”

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.600
Then you see, anything you see,

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.920
now say I went to Rio and I -

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.160
they showed Me the way they are having carnival.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.000
My God. I felt like vomiting, it’s so repulsive.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.400
So how will you react to things

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.160
depends on your attention.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.840
Buddha chitta, means the one which is enlightened attention;

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.000
how you react.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.720
Of course, if it is something Divine,

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.280
then you have a rapt attention, absolutely,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.960
you won't put your attention here and there

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.120
to you, it does not matter whatever may happen in the whole world;

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.160
a complete attention on that.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.080
But if it is something stupid,

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.240
you can see the essence of it;

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.000
if it is something humorous,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.920
you can see the essence of it.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.200
So what happens with that attention,

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.600
that you see to the essence of the whole thing,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.160
related to reality,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.680
compared to reality, it is stupid.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.720
In the light of reality, it is stupid.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.440
It can be mythical, it could be false,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.560
it could be hypocritical,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.480
all kinds of things

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.600
which are not reality.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.480
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.240
you should be able to see that point and enjoy.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.520
I've seen children do that very easily

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.400
and they understand up to a certain age,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.360
then I don't know what happens to them.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.480
But, say, when I had My children,

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.000
they used to go to see

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.480
Ram Leela, you see.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.160
Very small they were, at the school, they were studying [it] in the school.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.680
Every day they would go with our servant to see.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.840
All the servants would have a Ram Leela

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.960
and they would go and see

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.280
and they would come back and tell Me all the fun about it.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.080
They said, “Today Dashratha and his wife, you see,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.160
had such a fight and

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.440
suddenly we discovered both were men in that fight, you know.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.320
They were fighting each other.”

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.880
Something like that,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.320
and every time they used to tell Me the fun of it.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.000
But My servant said, “Look at our...”

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.000
they, 'baby' they called them. "…the babies."

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.280
See how they were enjoying. All the time laughing,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.800
they were so enjoying this Ram Leela as we were enjoying.”

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.080
You see, see the difference?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.480
These girls were laughing at the ridiculousness of the whole thing,

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.480
while this fellow was thinking that,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.000
they were really enjoying it and all that whole thing.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.880
So this is the understanding.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.520
Same thing when you see what is your reaction.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.000
That depends upon your chitta, on your attention, which is enlightened

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.120
and enlightened attention reacts

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.280
in a very different manner than a stupid attention,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.960
or a confused attention or the attention

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.600
which is full of negativity.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.680
So, one has to judge how you react.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.480
Like,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.560
I saw one funny punk fellow come to Me

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.040
and I said, “Why do you do like this?”

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.400
So one Sahaja Yogi said, “Mother, You shouldn't say like that.”

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.760
I said, “Why?”

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.920
“You see after all, that’s his religion.”

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.280
I said, “Really, this is his religion?”

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.400
So the fellow says, “What's wrong?”

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.280
I said, “Wrong is that

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.360
you have no identity.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.720
You have no self-esteem, that's why you try to paint yourself

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.280
and try to show that you are this and you are that, which you are not.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.960
Why don't you become what you are?”

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.960
And that fellow became a Sahaja Yogi later on.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.120
And this is what we have to see

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.520
that we have to accept what we are and we are the spirit.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.080
If we are the spirit,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.800
then we have to live and enjoy

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.400
and do whatever is necessary.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.440
But there are four things which Buddha has said very nicely,

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.400
which all of you should say every morning, I think, to understand.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.720
So first He says, “Buddham sharanam gacchami."

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.960
I surrender myself to Buddha.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.320
Means, “I surrender myself to my awakened attention,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.760
to my awakened consciousness.”

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.200
Buddham sharanam gacchami

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.280
Is very important to know that He said it again and again.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.520
Then He said, “Dhammam sharanam gacchami.”

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.120
That is, “I surrender myself to my dharma.”

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.320
Dharma is not what is outside, these religions which are mythical

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.880
and which are gone into some sort of a perversions.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.080
But the religion within myself,

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.200
the innate religion,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.160
I surrender myself to that,

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.640
which is righteousness,

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.200
which you know very well

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.000
what are the real things within us,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.680
which gives us all the value system.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.480
Then the third thing He has said,

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.600
"Sangham sharanam gacchami."

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.560
I surrender myself to collective.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.600
You have to meet.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.400
I’m trying My level best to get some place where you can all meet,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.200
even in the name of a picnic or anything,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.120
at least once a month.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.160
Sangham sharanam gacchami, is very important

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.600
because then you’ll know that you are part and parcel of the whole;

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.280
that a microcosm has become the macrocosm;

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.800
that you are a part and parcel of the Virat

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.080
that you become aware of it.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.760
And that is how things work out very fast,

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.360
that is how we help each other.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.080
That is how we discover a person who is negative;

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.160
that's how we discover who is not.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.360
We discover a person who is egoist, who is not egoist.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.760
That's how we discover the people who are

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.120
not at all Sahaja Yogis, claim themselves to be Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.520
and we just give them up, we understand.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.560
Without coming to the collective,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.320
without being collective, you can never understand

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.840
the value of collectivity.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.800
It is so great,

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.680
it gives you so many powers,

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.360
it gives you so much satisfaction, and joy,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:54.400
that one must, in Sahaja Yoga first pay attention to collectivity.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.280
Even supposing there's something missing, doesn't matter.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.680
You just become collective.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.520
While coming to collective,

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.920
you don't have to criticize others;

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.560
you don't have to call names of others.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.720
Don't find faults with them. But you introspect yourself

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.040
and know that “Why, when everybody is enjoying themselves,

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.720
why am I the one sitting down and trying to find faults?

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.360
Must be something wrong with me.”

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.320
If you can just pay attention to yourself,

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.800
as far as the defects are concerned,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.200
then I’m sure you will become much more collective,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.000
than when you start seeing the defects in other people.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.000
And no use, I mean no use seeing.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.120
Supposing, I have a spot on My sari, I better clean it.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.040
But if you have a spot on your sari, what's the use of looking at it?

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.160
I cannot clean it. You have to do it yourself.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.880
Is a simple thing, is a very practical thing and this kind of a practical...

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.760
Can you hear Me all of you?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.240
Such a practical thing has to be done

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.720
to understand that Sahaja Yoga is the most practical;

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.400
is the most practical because it is absolute reality.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.680
So, with all these powers,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.200
with all these understandings,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.600
with

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.280
all this compassionate love,

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.880
you have to be sure about yourself

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.120
and know that you are all the time protected, guided,

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.880
looked after, nourished, and

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.840
helped to grow by this divine Power,

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.920
which is all-pervading.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.400
May God bless you all.
