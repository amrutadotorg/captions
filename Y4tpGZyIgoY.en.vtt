WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:06.000
Today we have assembled here

00:06.280 --> 00:09.040
to do Shri Buddha Puja.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.920
I don't know how many of you have read of Buddha's life

00:14.120 --> 00:18.520
and how ultimately He achieved His enlightenment.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.760
I don't know how many of you have really

00:23.280 --> 00:25.000
seen the Buddhists

00:25.400 --> 00:27.520
or have met them,

00:28.400 --> 00:31.360
those who call themselves Buddhist.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.680
As in every religion,

00:35.040 --> 00:40.160
all of them got lost into some sort of a fundamentalism,

00:40.440 --> 00:43.640
because none of them got realization.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.560
And that's why everybody established their own style

00:48.760 --> 00:52.760
of religion, even, you can say that

00:53.400 --> 00:56.920
Tao of Lao-Tse also,

00:57.200 --> 01:00.400
or Zen of Viditama, all of them are

01:01.160 --> 01:03.400
all fruits of the same.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.320
We have to see how

01:16.320 --> 01:19.000
He first felt that

01:20.440 --> 01:24.640
one has to seek something beyond life.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.200
Once we are very much satisfied with whatever we have

01:29.400 --> 01:32.760
because He was a king's son, He had a very nice wife,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.680
He had a son

01:34.880 --> 01:38.320
and naturally, anybody in that position would be quite satisfied.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.040
But He saw a very sick man one day,

01:42.240 --> 01:47.080
He saw a beggar, and also He saw a dead man

01:48.200 --> 01:51.240
and everybody crying for that dead person.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.360
He couldn't understand how this misery has come

01:55.800 --> 01:58.920
and what is the need to have this misery.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.160
So He gave up His family,

02:03.400 --> 02:07.320
He gave up His luxuries of life,

02:07.760 --> 02:12.040
everything He gave up, and went in search of the truth,

02:12.360 --> 02:14.640
as many of you have done.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.800
He would have been lost also, I would say,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.680
because He read all the Upanishads,

02:20.920 --> 02:23.360
and He read all the books that were possible,

02:23.560 --> 02:27.480
for Him to say what is the truth is.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.800
But He couldn't get anything.

02:30.680 --> 02:34.000
He took a complete sanyasa, in the sense,

02:34.200 --> 02:36.280
as far as the food is concerned,

02:36.480 --> 02:39.160
as far as entertainment is concerned,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.000
everything He gave up.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.360
And ultimately, He was lying under a banyan tree,

02:46.640 --> 02:48.040
and suddenly

02:49.720 --> 02:51.760
the Adishakti gave Him realization

02:51.960 --> 02:54.600
because He was so true and was

02:54.800 --> 02:56.920
one of the one marked

02:57.160 --> 03:01.520
for a special place in the Virata.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.240
He had to achieve that.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.880
Of course, I need not tell you about His previous lives, perhaps,

03:10.120 --> 03:13.080
in so many of My lectures I have already talked about it,

03:13.280 --> 03:14.760
what was His previous life

03:14.960 --> 03:19.760
and how He achieved His own enlightenment about Himself.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.640
But what we have to see from His life is that

03:26.000 --> 03:28.240
He discovered and He found out

03:28.440 --> 03:32.240
that want is the reason;

03:32.440 --> 03:37.000
the desire is the reason, of all the miseries.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.720
But He didn't know, what was the real want?

03:40.920 --> 03:42.840
What was the pure want?

03:43.120 --> 03:46.120
What was the pure desire?

03:46.440 --> 03:49.720
And that's how He could not explain to people

03:49.920 --> 03:55.600
that they have to take to their awakening through their kundalini.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.880
As He had followed such an

04:00.440 --> 04:02.200
ascetic life

04:02.880 --> 04:06.280
that became the code for the Buddhists.

04:06.760 --> 04:11.040
The other day I was reading about Buddha when I was in Thailand

04:11.240 --> 04:13.040
and I was surprised

04:13.240 --> 04:16.360
that the bhikkus, that means the bhikku is

04:16.560 --> 04:18.960
actually in Sanskrit it means bhikshyus,

04:19.200 --> 04:21.160
is the one who asks for alms,

04:21.360 --> 04:25.000
or a beggar you can call it – but religious beggar.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.680
So, He used to carry thousands of people with Him,

04:27.960 --> 04:30.080
at least minimum of thousand

04:30.360 --> 04:33.240
bare feet, without any

04:34.400 --> 04:35.600
provision for food,

04:35.800 --> 04:38.560
without any arrangements for stay, nothing,

04:39.960 --> 04:44.520
and they were supposed to shave off their heads completely,

04:45.440 --> 04:49.440
no moustaches, no hair on the body at all.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.000
Moreover, they were supposed to wear only one dress.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.360
One long dress they had to tie up like this

04:58.720 --> 05:00.640
and cover themselves,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.040
whether it was cold season

05:04.360 --> 05:08.640
or it was a warm season, whatever it was.

05:09.640 --> 05:13.160
They were not allowed to sing or to dance,

05:13.400 --> 05:16.880
or to entertain themselves, by anything.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.400
And food was just collected

05:20.680 --> 05:22.920
from the village, whatever they visited,

05:23.160 --> 05:25.720
whatever they got, very minimum.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.080
Whatever they got,

05:29.760 --> 05:31.600
it was cooked for them

05:32.120 --> 05:36.720
and they would offer their guru first and then eat that food.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.800
Imagine thousand people going like that,

05:40.520 --> 05:44.000
bare feet, in the scorching heat

05:44.760 --> 05:47.160
or in the

05:48.000 --> 05:48.960
mud,

05:49.880 --> 05:54.080
or in rain. In all seasons they used to walk,

05:54.360 --> 05:57.200
giving up all their family relationships.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.800
Even if the husband and wife both of them joined the sangha,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.080
then they were not supposed to live like husband and wife.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.040
So, to give up all other physical wants,

06:09.280 --> 06:12.360
mental wants, emotional wants

06:13.040 --> 06:18.040
was the way they tried to follow, because He said the want creates it.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.000
But if you see the Buddhists,

06:22.440 --> 06:24.200
they do all these things.

06:24.440 --> 06:28.000
You’ll be amazed even if he is a king, he does that.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.600
And many kings who joined at that time,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.600
one of them was Ashoka, from India.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.560
He dressed up like that, he became like that,

06:37.760 --> 06:40.880
he started traveling in the same manner

06:41.080 --> 06:45.240
and tried to lead a complete ascetic life.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.520
Very difficult life it was and they thought

06:48.720 --> 06:53.160
that by doing all that, they will achieve their realization.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.640
They say that two of His disciples did achieve,

06:57.160 --> 06:59.560
their names are Moggallana and Sariputta.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.200
These two people got their realization.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.680
But the whole thing was absolutely a life,

07:07.880 --> 07:10.240
dry and insipid,

07:11.160 --> 07:12.760
had no fun either,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
no children were allowed,

07:15.200 --> 07:18.760
no family life was allowed.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.720
So it became a very secluded, very harsh,

07:24.240 --> 07:27.400
I can say, very dry life.

07:27.600 --> 07:31.000
Though it was called as a sangha, means the collectivity;

07:31.360 --> 07:33.640
but in that collectivity

07:34.160 --> 07:35.920
there was no rapport as such

07:36.120 --> 07:38.840
because they were not supposed to talk too much,

07:39.080 --> 07:41.800
they were not supposed to

07:43.880 --> 07:46.520
discuss anything about, say, politics

07:46.720 --> 07:48.800
or economics or anything.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.960
Only they could talk about meditation,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.520
of achieving the highest life.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.320
So you can imagine

07:58.520 --> 08:01.040
what sort of life they had to lead

08:01.240 --> 08:02.880
to become enlightened.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.400
And that idea continued in so many [places],

08:07.720 --> 08:08.800
religions,

08:09.040 --> 08:10.600
specially,

08:11.560 --> 08:13.640
it then started making people

08:13.880 --> 08:17.280
take away the money of the householders

08:17.480 --> 08:19.720
by saying that you have to give up everything.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.360
Of course, at the time of Buddha also,

08:21.560 --> 08:25.320
they had to give up everything and join the sangha,

08:26.520 --> 08:31.720
but here it was a genuine effort of Buddha

08:31.920 --> 08:33.800
to take them to enlightenment,

08:34.120 --> 08:37.280
to make them people who were

08:38.600 --> 08:42.040
knowledgeable about the absolute realities.

08:42.640 --> 08:46.280
But it did not happen, and that is the reason why

08:46.560 --> 08:49.000
we find that Buddhists have gone

08:49.200 --> 08:53.600
into different types of funny Buddhism.

08:53.960 --> 08:58.880
For example, now we have some Buddhism, say in Japan,

08:59.440 --> 09:03.920
where it was not allowed to kill any animal.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.000
So, they said, “All right, we are not killing any animal

09:06.240 --> 09:08.960
but we can eat killed animals,” you see.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.680
They found out a solution out of that.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.200
Then also, then they can

09:15.600 --> 09:17.480
they could kill human beings, because

09:17.680 --> 09:20.920
it’s not allowed to kill animals, but we can kill human beings.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.320
So Japanese become experts in killing human beings, you see.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.840
How people find out loopholes, you can see this very clearly.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.520
Then the second type of Buddhism came,

09:32.800 --> 09:36.560
where this Lao-Tse taught about Tao.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.320
But Tao actually is

09:38.520 --> 09:42.080
He’s the only one who started talking about Kundalini.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.160
Tao is the Kundalini.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.240
But, that too, was too much for these people.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.120
They just couldn't understand what He was talking about.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.440
But the way He expressed Himself in paintings,

09:53.640 --> 09:56.120
and other things, just to deviate

09:56.320 --> 09:59.200
from that kind of a harsh Buddhism.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.200
But somehow, despite that,

10:02.520 --> 10:06.000
it never took proper roots,

10:06.680 --> 10:09.320
and I have met people who follow Tao

10:09.560 --> 10:10.680
and absolutely you don't understand

10:10.960 --> 10:12.840
how these people are following

10:13.080 --> 10:15.200
the path of Kundalini.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.800
There's a river called Yangtze by which when you travel,

10:19.080 --> 10:21.120
you find variety of things.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.400
After every five minutes, the scene changes,

10:24.640 --> 10:30.040
all the beautiful mountains take another form,

10:30.240 --> 10:34.320
and you have lots of waterfalls, and it’s very interesting.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.800
That is the Kundalini.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.200
Tao is that river.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.880
But it’s said that you should not divert your attention

10:42.080 --> 10:46.200
to these temptations which are outside.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.840
You should see them, but move.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.400
And that is what is Tao, which He brought in,

10:52.680 --> 10:57.000
but they got lost because they started painting all those things and

10:57.320 --> 11:01.760
doing all kinds of, more into art.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.000
Basically, Buddha never thought of any art,

11:05.200 --> 11:07.080
He never wanted to have any art,

11:07.280 --> 11:09.480
and He didnt want to do anything with art, He said,

11:09.760 --> 11:12.640
but only thing is that you have to

11:12.880 --> 11:15.840
introspect and go within, and deep down,

11:16.080 --> 11:18.880
and find out what is the absolute truth.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.080
So the whole thing started deviating like this.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.360
Then this Zen system was the same, as mixed up with Kundalini,

11:26.600 --> 11:30.760
which Viditama, one of His great disciples, who started in Japan.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.400
Now, the Zen system is

11:33.640 --> 11:38.000
that they used to put, I mean sometimes hit also,

11:38.280 --> 11:41.040
on the back of

11:41.560 --> 11:45.960
the – what you call – spinal cord, on the chakras

11:46.240 --> 11:49.000
and they would try to raise the kundalini,

11:49.240 --> 11:50.960
all kinds of horrible things.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.920
In the Zen system, they developed very harsh methods

11:55.160 --> 11:56.640
of raising the Kundalini.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.040
It went to such a limit that

11:58.240 --> 12:01.920
I have met people who have broken their spinal cords,

12:02.320 --> 12:05.080
then Kundalini will never rise in any case if the spinal cord …

12:05.280 --> 12:06.320
… please pay attention here.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.880
One lady walks out then attention goes out.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.400
I mean, if your attention is so poor ...

12:11.600 --> 12:15.040
Please pay attention here, do you understand that?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.800
If one person walks out, your attention should not go

12:18.000 --> 12:19.400
and please don't come inside to disturb.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.400
You see, the trouble is we must understand

12:21.600 --> 12:24.480
that our attention has to be steady.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.680
Any lady walks out if your attention moves out

12:27.880 --> 12:30.600
then understand that you have to meditate more.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.840
Please keep the attention.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.040
So now, then this Viditama Zen

12:37.280 --> 12:39.880
also took a very different form.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.800
I met one of the head of the Viditama Zen system,

12:44.040 --> 12:48.000
and I was surprised because – they called Me because he was very sick,

12:48.200 --> 12:50.360
so they said that “Mother, please help him to cure.”

12:50.600 --> 12:52.960
But I found he was not at all a realized soul

12:53.200 --> 12:55.400
and did not know a word about Kundalini.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
So I said, “How are you the head,

12:57.800 --> 13:01.000
how is it that you have become the head when you do not know

13:01.200 --> 13:04.680
the meaning of Kundalini?”

13:05.640 --> 13:09.360
So he said, “What is Kundalini?”

13:09.840 --> 13:11.320
He couldn't understand anything.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.080
I said, “What is Zen?”

13:13.320 --> 13:15.800
Zen is to meditate, dhyana.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.480
I said, “All right, but what about it?”

13:18.760 --> 13:19.840
“Yes, yes there is.”

13:20.080 --> 13:22.520
I mean so confused he was.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.560
Then I asked him, “You are not a realized soul,

13:26.760 --> 13:28.280
then how is it you are the head?”

13:28.480 --> 13:31.000
He said, “We never had any realized soul

13:31.240 --> 13:32.840
for now, ages.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.440
Only for six centuries we had some kashayapas –

13:36.680 --> 13:37.880
they call them kashayapas.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.480
And after that we had no realized souls at all.”

13:42.400 --> 13:44.000
So, just think,

13:44.760 --> 13:49.960
under what circumstances you got your realization.

13:50.480 --> 13:54.120
Without sacrificing anything,

13:54.360 --> 13:56.920
without giving up anything,

13:57.200 --> 14:00.880
without working out any one of these

14:01.400 --> 14:04.440
tapasyas – penances.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.400
Because Buddha is the Tapa.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.400
These three Deities on your Agnya Chakra:

14:10.640 --> 14:13.440
Christ, Mahavira and Buddha.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.920
Three of them are Tapa.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.800
Tapa means penance.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.920
You have to do penance;

14:22.160 --> 14:24.720
and penance, now in Sahaja Yoga,

14:24.920 --> 14:27.240
doesn't mean that you give up your wife

14:27.520 --> 14:31.080
or give up your husband, give up your children, give up your family.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.080
But here Tapa means meditation.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.280
And for meditation, you must know when to get up,

14:38.520 --> 14:42.240
that should be the most important thing for a Sahaja Yogi.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.360
The rest of the things automatically will work out,

14:45.600 --> 14:46.640
and you'll understand.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.120
To grow your depth you have to meditate,

14:49.360 --> 14:51.200
is a absolutely simple thing.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.200
You don't have to shave your head,

14:53.400 --> 14:55.120
you don't have to starve yourself,

14:55.320 --> 14:56.880
you don't have to walk bare feet,

14:57.120 --> 14:59.080
you can sing, you can dance,

14:59.320 --> 15:02.040
I mean, you can entertain yourself with music.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.200
There, you are not even allowed to see a drama,

15:04.400 --> 15:06.560
or a play, or anything like that.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.480
I mean, so many things if you see the list,

15:08.680 --> 15:11.760
you'd go really crazy, how could people exist?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.640
But there were thousand peoples with Him,

15:14.840 --> 15:16.800
who were traveling with Him

15:17.040 --> 15:21.480
and they became so poor, they were just wearing rags.

15:21.680 --> 15:26.560
Ultimately, a big

15:28.320 --> 15:29.840
trader was passing by

15:30.040 --> 15:31.400
and he saw them and he thought,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.880
“What poor people these are, just beggars.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.160
God knows they are lepers or what are they?”

15:36.400 --> 15:38.480
And he had a great feeling for them.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.400
And he gave them some food to eat

15:41.680 --> 15:44.920
and everything and still he did not know that it was the tathāgata -

15:45.120 --> 15:48.520
means it was "Buddha who was going".

15:48.840 --> 15:50.680
So Buddha's main thing,

15:50.880 --> 15:53.280
Buddha itself means bodh,

15:53.480 --> 15:55.240
from bodha, and the bodh means:

15:55.480 --> 16:00.440
to know the reality on your central nervous system

16:00.680 --> 16:02.960
is the bodha.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.240
You all have become now Buddhas,

16:05.440 --> 16:08.360
without giving up anything

16:08.640 --> 16:12.560
because whatever He gave up was all nonsense.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.520
It was a myth.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.920
If it was a myth, what's the use of giving up the myth?

16:18.200 --> 16:20.760
What does it matter if you listen to music,

16:20.960 --> 16:24.680
what does it matter if you dance, it doesn't matter at all.

16:24.960 --> 16:29.240
But these ideas went so deep into these people

16:29.440 --> 16:32.760
that you really feel such pity and such compassion

16:32.960 --> 16:35.160
that look at them, where are they getting lost?

16:35.360 --> 16:36.520
They don't eat their food,

16:36.720 --> 16:38.600
they have their food only once in a while

16:38.800 --> 16:43.360
and they are starving, they look like really worse than TB patients.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.600
But while you people look like really roses,

16:46.800 --> 16:51.280
beautifully all of you are enjoying life and everything is there.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.800
But still one has to know that

16:53.000 --> 16:56.600
we have to have that principle of Buddha within ourselves.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.840
And what is that principle of Buddha,

16:59.040 --> 17:02.320
is that we have to do tapa.

17:02.960 --> 17:06.640
Tapa doesn't mean -I don't say - you starve yourself.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.960
But also if you have too much interest in food,

17:09.160 --> 17:12.960
is better to take to little fasting.

17:13.480 --> 17:18.200
I never said that you should not enjoy music, never.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.880
No question, you should.

17:20.120 --> 17:25.240
But then you should enjoy music which is for your emancipation,

17:25.440 --> 17:29.000
for your awakening, for your ascent.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.640
I don't say don't do, because yourself now you are a Buddha.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.120
Buddha was not to be told anything,

17:34.320 --> 17:37.040
He told everyone, but He was not to be told.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.960
In the same way, I don't have to tell you.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.800
It is only you have to understand.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.360
But sometimes we are really bound by so many conditionings

17:46.560 --> 17:49.080
that I find very difficult for people

17:49.280 --> 17:54.840
to understand what is the spirit.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.080
Spirit is boundless.

17:57.400 --> 18:05.240
It is a free expression of God's love.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.320
So, when it comes to the free expression of God's love,

18:09.520 --> 18:12.440
the compassion, the love,

18:13.400 --> 18:16.960
then one has to understand, do we do that or not?

18:17.640 --> 18:22.360
Even now there are many conditionings which are still working in us.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.200
For example, some of you are like this

18:25.440 --> 18:28.160
that “I belong to this nationality, to that nationality,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.080
I am this, I am that.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.680
We are very proud of that.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.240
We cannot mix up with other people,

18:34.440 --> 18:37.520
we are too high for the other people."

18:37.800 --> 18:39.680
Or something like that.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.480
You are now become a universal being.

18:44.120 --> 18:48.000
So, you – how can you have these stupid limitations

18:48.240 --> 18:50.040
which are mythical again.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.960
So, one must see, introspect and find out

18:53.200 --> 18:54.760
if you are having

18:56.000 --> 18:58.800
what's the matter with her, take her away

19:01.680 --> 19:03.680
Also with your children, you must see, you see,

19:03.880 --> 19:05.680
very important how they behave,

19:05.880 --> 19:09.000
if they are aggressive or how they behave.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.480
Is very important because they are also Buddhas,

19:12.680 --> 19:14.080
they are also realized souls.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.760
But they have certain conditionings in them

19:17.000 --> 19:20.560
and they are behaving according to those conditioning.

19:21.520 --> 19:26.800
Now as it is, we can see there is light within us.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.400
What happens that we start seeing

19:30.600 --> 19:33.600
what's wrong with us and we just drop it out.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.840
But even when you see that,

19:36.080 --> 19:39.480
if you cannot drop it out then must know that you need

19:39.720 --> 19:42.760
more of power.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.760
Then you must learn how to raise your kundalini,

19:45.960 --> 19:49.080
how to be connected with the

19:49.680 --> 19:52.040
divine Power all the time,

19:52.240 --> 19:54.280
so that you are in thoughtless awareness

19:54.520 --> 19:58.240
and that you grow within yourself in a depth.

19:59.080 --> 20:04.240
I find the conditioning that is very much lurking still

20:04.440 --> 20:07.360
is “my and mine”

20:07.720 --> 20:09.920
in, still in Sahaja Yogis.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.640
Like before this what I had heard about,

20:12.840 --> 20:14.840
say English or all Western people,

20:15.080 --> 20:17.720
because I am talking to the Western people here,

20:17.960 --> 20:21.400
that they didn't care for their family, their wives, their children,

20:21.640 --> 20:24.960
every third day they were divorcing, or fourth day

20:25.200 --> 20:28.400
they are running off with some other husbands or something like that.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.040
Now I find they stick, like glue.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.160
Wife becomes very important, husband becomes very important.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.200
My house becomes very important,

20:37.400 --> 20:39.200
my children become very important,

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
and first they were not interested in children,

20:41.640 --> 20:44.880
now they are sticking on to children like,

20:45.160 --> 20:46.960
as if with some glue.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.760
It's impossible for them to tell that, see

20:50.960 --> 20:54.360
children belong to the sangha, to the collectivity.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.160
You don't think this is your child.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.160
Once you start thinking like that, then you are limiting yourself

21:00.400 --> 21:02.600
and getting into problems.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.000
The country-wise also

21:05.280 --> 21:09.280
the problems are reducing very much, I should say.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.360
Also we are, we don't like to be racist,

21:12.600 --> 21:15.560
I know people hate those who are racist,

21:15.760 --> 21:18.080
they want racialism to go away.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.840
As in India, I’ve seen, Sahaja Yogis want

21:21.040 --> 21:22.840
all the caste system must go away.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.800
Because these are self-destructive.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.600
So we start seeing in ourselves what is self-destructive.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.000
What will destroy me;

21:32.720 --> 21:34.800
then what will destroy my family;

21:35.000 --> 21:38.720
then what will destroy my country and what will destroy the whole world?

21:39.120 --> 21:40.520
All these

21:42.560 --> 21:46.160
ventures which are just the opposite

21:46.360 --> 21:48.320
of your constructive life,

21:48.560 --> 21:50.800
you start seeing, you see your derailment,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.080
you see you are going towards destruction,

21:53.360 --> 21:55.440
and you can stop it

21:56.760 --> 21:59.120
and that is very important.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.880
Only possible if you try

22:03.400 --> 22:06.040
to introspect yourself and meditate

22:06.280 --> 22:08.560
and see, have I got this quality?

22:08.760 --> 22:13.800
Some of them are very proud of their certain temperaments,

22:14.040 --> 22:17.960
like “I am like this, what to do Mother? I am like this.”

22:18.720 --> 22:19.920
No more.

22:20.640 --> 22:25.240
Now all your beautiful qualities have been awakened by your Kundalini.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.320
Shows that nothing was dead, nothing was finished,

22:28.560 --> 22:30.280
they were all there intact

22:30.480 --> 22:33.480
and when the Kundalini started rising,

22:33.680 --> 22:37.800
she just awakened all those beautiful qualities.

22:38.040 --> 22:43.040
Apart from that, in the Guru Puja, I'll tell you what all has happened.

22:43.280 --> 22:47.000
Of course, you must have seen in Sahashrara Puja, I told you about yourself,

22:47.240 --> 22:51.320
that what you have achieved, you have no idea as to what powers you have got.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.480
But in Guru Puja, I'll definitely tell you

22:54.720 --> 22:56.880
what is the thing that

22:57.360 --> 22:58.560
is Sahaja Yoga.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.280
It's one of the most

23:03.120 --> 23:07.880
precious thing, that a human being should have known, long time back.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.800
It is not only talking about God,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.320
it is not only saying there's divinity within you

23:16.600 --> 23:20.400
but the effectiveness of that.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.520
So you don't need any science,

23:22.720 --> 23:26.240
you have any problem, all right, give a bandhan, finished.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.840
So simple.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.680
If you want anything, just give a bandhan, it’s finished.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.400
You want to give realization, you raise that much.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.080
That’s kundalini is raised.

23:41.360 --> 23:46.280
Everything that you can do with science, you can do with Sahaja Yoga.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.400
We are also computers.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.880
Sometimes I say something, you say “Mother, how do You know?”

23:51.080 --> 23:53.360
I say, “I am a computer, no doubt.”

23:55.200 --> 23:56.800
But you all are computers,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.040
only thing you have to develop your depth.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.400
Now you are on the right lines,

24:01.600 --> 24:06.640
so we don't need this science which can destroy all of us.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.480
Everything can be done through Sahaja Yoga.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.800
And this is what I'll explain to you in Guru Puja –

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
how you become so capable.

24:16.200 --> 24:19.000
So, please have self-esteem.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.880
You must have self-esteem and understand that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.200
First and foremost, you are a Sahaja Yogi

24:25.400 --> 24:29.400
and as Sahaja Yogi, you have to achieve that state

24:29.640 --> 24:32.840
where you become absolutely capable

24:33.080 --> 24:37.520
of doing whatever science can do,

24:37.960 --> 24:40.400
whatever anybody could do,

24:40.600 --> 24:43.400
this is the real siddhi,

24:43.600 --> 24:49.920
means you become a embodiment of all the powers.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.000
There's some people who come and tell Me,

24:52.240 --> 24:53.480
“Mother, We can’t open our heart.”

24:53.720 --> 24:56.600
I mean I don't say you have an open heart surgery.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.680
But to “open my heart” means

24:58.920 --> 25:01.400
just see what's wrong with you.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.680
Can't you feel compassion?

25:04.880 --> 25:09.080
But I’ve seen people having an open heart for a dog, or for a cat.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.480
But they don't have open heart for their children sometimes.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.040
Now how can you not have open heart in Sahaja Yoga?

25:16.240 --> 25:19.480
That's the first place where the spirit exists

25:19.680 --> 25:23.440
and it emits its light and when it emits its light,

25:23.640 --> 25:28.400
that's the first place where you see the life

25:28.680 --> 25:33.360
of a person who is full of love.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.160
So, how can it be, there is

25:36.400 --> 25:39.320
this problem that “I can't open my heart.”

25:39.520 --> 25:41.600
This must be coming because

25:41.840 --> 25:45.640
you have only ego but no self-esteem.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.200
So, Buddha is the one who is the killer of ego.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.200
He's the killer of ego.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.480
He is, as you have seen it,

25:56.680 --> 26:00.480
He is moving on your

26:01.600 --> 26:02.640
Pingala Nadi

26:02.880 --> 26:05.720
and comes and then settles down on this side,

26:05.920 --> 26:07.800
the left side.

26:09.400 --> 26:14.240
He's the one who is the controller of our ego,

26:14.520 --> 26:17.280
and how He has tried

26:18.600 --> 26:21.520
to compensate this right side.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.440
First of all, you must have seen the laughing Buddha.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.000
He’s very fat,

26:26.200 --> 26:29.560
and a person who is right-sided is very thin,

26:29.760 --> 26:32.200
is never laughing, never smiles even.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.960
Even if you tickle, he may not.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.760
So, they have shown Buddha as a person,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.040
He'll have many children sitting on His stomach, all over His body

26:44.280 --> 26:47.160
and everywhere, and He’ll be laughing.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.880
So, just see how they have shown the compensation

26:51.120 --> 26:53.640
of Buddha, the one

26:53.880 --> 26:56.960
who is the controller of our right side.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.600
So, how He controls our right side, just laughs out and out.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.120
He makes fun of Himself,

27:02.320 --> 27:04.480
He makes fun of everything.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.160
Anything they see – for example, now

27:07.360 --> 27:10.600
as He said, “Don't see any drama.” All right.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.920
I say, “You see every drama.”

27:13.160 --> 27:16.840
But in that you see with your enlightened consciousness,

27:17.080 --> 27:21.080
you can see the stupidity of it and enjoy the stupidity.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.760
For example, this Elizabeth lady

27:24.960 --> 27:27.760
was married eight times, or something – nine,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I don't know how many times she was married, I’ve lost count.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.880
So these stupid people went there,

27:34.080 --> 27:38.200
three, four thousand, imagine, more than you people,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.480
were standing around,

27:42.680 --> 27:44.160
and there were helicopters

27:44.360 --> 27:46.880
who were sending parachutes, you see,

27:47.520 --> 27:50.800
down, and everybody was so much enamored

27:51.040 --> 27:53.480
and the parachuters were falling on the trees,

27:53.720 --> 27:57.120
sometimes falling on the people.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.760
And it was all in the newspaper,

27:58.960 --> 28:01.760
a big news for these Americans, you see.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.560
So, you should see the stupidity of that.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.480
If you could see the stupidity,

28:08.680 --> 28:09.760
then it's all right.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
But if you become one of those spectators

28:12.240 --> 28:14.360
and think, “Oh, what a thing is that ...

28:17.000 --> 28:20.480
what a luck that I have been able to see this lady,

28:21.840 --> 28:24.120
such an inauspicious person,

28:25.800 --> 28:28.240
going for her honeymoon.”

28:29.840 --> 28:31.600
Then you see, anything you see,

28:31.840 --> 28:33.920
now say I went to Rio and I -

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
they showed Me the way they are having carnival.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.000
My God. I felt like vomiting, it’s so repulsive.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.400
So how will you react to things

28:43.600 --> 28:47.160
depends on your attention.

28:47.440 --> 28:51.840
Buddha chitta, means the one which is enlightened attention;

28:52.080 --> 28:54.000
how you react.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.720
Of course, if it is something Divine,

28:57.960 --> 29:00.280
then you have a rapt attention, absolutely,

29:00.520 --> 29:01.960
you won't put your attention here and there

29:02.160 --> 29:06.120
to you, it does not matter whatever may happen in the whole world;

29:06.360 --> 29:09.160
a complete attention on that.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.080
But if it is something stupid,

29:13.360 --> 29:15.240
you can see the essence of it;

29:15.480 --> 29:17.000
if it is something humorous,

29:17.200 --> 29:18.920
you can see the essence of it.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.200
So what happens with that attention,

29:21.400 --> 29:24.600
that you see to the essence of the whole thing,

29:24.840 --> 29:28.160
related to reality,

29:29.040 --> 29:33.680
compared to reality, it is stupid.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.720
In the light of reality, it is stupid.

29:37.960 --> 29:41.440
It can be mythical, it could be false,

29:41.640 --> 29:43.560
it could be hypocritical,

29:43.760 --> 29:45.480
all kinds of things

29:45.680 --> 29:47.600
which are not reality.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.480
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

29:51.720 --> 29:55.240
you should be able to see that point and enjoy.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.520
I've seen children do that very easily

29:59.720 --> 30:01.400
and they understand up to a certain age,

30:01.600 --> 30:03.360
then I don't know what happens to them.

30:03.600 --> 30:07.480
But, say, when I had My children,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.000
they used to go to see

30:10.600 --> 30:12.480
Ram Leela, you see.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.160
Very small they were, at the school, they were studying [it] in the school.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.680
Every day they would go with our servant to see.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.840
All the servants would have a Ram Leela

30:21.040 --> 30:21.960
and they would go and see

30:22.160 --> 30:25.280
and they would come back and tell Me all the fun about it.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.080
They said, “Today Dashratha and his wife, you see,

30:29.280 --> 30:32.160
had such a fight and

30:32.360 --> 30:35.440
suddenly we discovered both were men in that fight, you know.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.320
They were fighting each other.”

30:38.560 --> 30:39.880
Something like that,

30:40.080 --> 30:42.320
and every time they used to tell Me the fun of it.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.000
But My servant said, “Look at our...”

30:45.200 --> 30:48.000
they, 'baby' they called them. "…the babies."

30:48.240 --> 30:50.280
See how they were enjoying. All the time laughing,

30:50.480 --> 30:53.800
they were so enjoying this Ram Leela as we were enjoying.”

30:54.000 --> 30:55.080
You see, see the difference?

30:55.320 --> 30:58.480
These girls were laughing at the ridiculousness of the whole thing,

30:58.680 --> 31:00.480
while this fellow was thinking that,

31:00.720 --> 31:05.000
they were really enjoying it and all that whole thing.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.880
So this is the understanding.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.520
Same thing when you see what is your reaction.

31:11.760 --> 31:16.000
That depends upon your chitta, on your attention, which is enlightened

31:16.200 --> 31:19.120
and enlightened attention reacts

31:19.320 --> 31:22.280
in a very different manner than a stupid attention,

31:22.480 --> 31:25.960
or a confused attention or the attention

31:26.200 --> 31:29.600
which is full of negativity.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.680
So, one has to judge how you react.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.480
Like,

31:36.680 --> 31:41.560
I saw one funny punk fellow come to Me

31:42.120 --> 31:44.040
and I said, “Why do you do like this?”

31:44.400 --> 31:46.400
So one Sahaja Yogi said, “Mother, You shouldn't say like that.”

31:46.640 --> 31:47.760
I said, “Why?”

31:48.040 --> 31:49.920
“You see after all, that’s his religion.”

31:50.120 --> 31:53.280
I said, “Really, this is his religion?”

31:53.520 --> 31:55.400
So the fellow says, “What's wrong?”

31:55.600 --> 31:58.280
I said, “Wrong is that

31:58.680 --> 32:00.360
you have no identity.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.720
You have no self-esteem, that's why you try to paint yourself

32:03.960 --> 32:07.280
and try to show that you are this and you are that, which you are not.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.960
Why don't you become what you are?”

32:09.160 --> 32:11.960
And that fellow became a Sahaja Yogi later on.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.120
And this is what we have to see

32:14.360 --> 32:18.520
that we have to accept what we are and we are the spirit.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.080
If we are the spirit,

32:20.320 --> 32:22.800
then we have to live and enjoy

32:23.040 --> 32:25.400
and do whatever is necessary.

32:25.720 --> 32:29.440
But there are four things which Buddha has said very nicely,

32:29.720 --> 32:33.400
which all of you should say every morning, I think, to understand.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.720
So first He says, “Buddham sharanam gacchami."

32:36.920 --> 32:38.960
I surrender myself to Buddha.

32:39.200 --> 32:43.320
Means, “I surrender myself to my awakened attention,

32:44.000 --> 32:45.760
to my awakened consciousness.”

32:45.960 --> 32:48.200
Buddham sharanam gacchami

32:48.400 --> 32:52.280
Is very important to know that He said it again and again.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.520
Then He said, “Dhammam sharanam gacchami.”

32:55.800 --> 33:00.120
That is, “I surrender myself to my dharma.”

33:00.360 --> 33:04.320
Dharma is not what is outside, these religions which are mythical

33:04.520 --> 33:07.880
and which are gone into some sort of a perversions.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.080
But the religion within myself,

33:10.320 --> 33:12.200
the innate religion,

33:12.400 --> 33:14.160
I surrender myself to that,

33:14.400 --> 33:15.640
which is righteousness,

33:15.840 --> 33:17.200
which you know very well

33:17.440 --> 33:21.000
what are the real things within us,

33:21.240 --> 33:24.680
which gives us all the value system.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.480
Then the third thing He has said,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.600
"Sangham sharanam gacchami."

33:31.840 --> 33:35.560
I surrender myself to collective.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.600
You have to meet.

33:37.840 --> 33:41.400
I’m trying My level best to get some place where you can all meet,

33:41.640 --> 33:44.200
even in the name of a picnic or anything,

33:44.400 --> 33:46.120
at least once a month.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.160
Sangham sharanam gacchami, is very important

33:49.360 --> 33:53.600
because then you’ll know that you are part and parcel of the whole;

33:53.800 --> 33:57.280
that a microcosm has become the macrocosm;

33:57.600 --> 33:59.800
that you are a part and parcel of the Virat

34:00.000 --> 34:02.080
that you become aware of it.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.760
And that is how things work out very fast,

34:04.960 --> 34:06.360
that is how we help each other.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.080
That is how we discover a person who is negative;

34:09.280 --> 34:11.160
that's how we discover who is not.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.360
We discover a person who is egoist, who is not egoist.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.760
That's how we discover the people who are

34:18.000 --> 34:21.120
not at all Sahaja Yogis, claim themselves to be Sahaja Yogis,

34:21.360 --> 34:24.520
and we just give them up, we understand.

34:25.680 --> 34:27.560
Without coming to the collective,

34:27.760 --> 34:33.320
without being collective, you can never understand

34:34.800 --> 34:37.840
the value of collectivity.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.800
It is so great,

34:41.040 --> 34:43.680
it gives you so many powers,

34:43.880 --> 34:48.360
it gives you so much satisfaction, and joy,

34:48.600 --> 34:54.400
that one must, in Sahaja Yoga first pay attention to collectivity.

34:54.680 --> 34:58.280
Even supposing there's something missing, doesn't matter.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.680
You just become collective.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.520
While coming to collective,

35:02.720 --> 35:04.920
you don't have to criticize others;

35:05.120 --> 35:07.560
you don't have to call names of others.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.720
Don't find faults with them. But you introspect yourself

35:11.920 --> 35:15.040
and know that “Why, when everybody is enjoying themselves,

35:15.240 --> 35:18.720
why am I the one sitting down and trying to find faults?

35:18.960 --> 35:21.360
Must be something wrong with me.”

35:21.840 --> 35:25.320
If you can just pay attention to yourself,

35:25.560 --> 35:28.800
as far as the defects are concerned,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.200
then I’m sure you will become much more collective,

35:33.400 --> 35:37.000
than when you start seeing the defects in other people.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.000
And no use, I mean no use seeing.

35:40.200 --> 35:44.120
Supposing, I have a spot on My sari, I better clean it.

35:44.360 --> 35:48.040
But if you have a spot on your sari, what's the use of looking at it?

35:48.240 --> 35:51.160
I cannot clean it. You have to do it yourself.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.880
Is a simple thing, is a very practical thing and this kind of a practical...

35:55.120 --> 35:56.760
Can you hear Me all of you?

35:59.280 --> 36:02.240
Such a practical thing has to be done

36:02.480 --> 36:07.720
to understand that Sahaja Yoga is the most practical;

36:08.120 --> 36:13.400
is the most practical because it is absolute reality.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.680
So, with all these powers,

36:15.920 --> 36:18.200
with all these understandings,

36:18.440 --> 36:19.600
with

36:19.880 --> 36:23.280
all this compassionate love,

36:24.080 --> 36:27.880
you have to be sure about yourself

36:28.760 --> 36:33.120
and know that you are all the time protected, guided,

36:33.320 --> 36:37.880
looked after, nourished, and

36:38.520 --> 36:41.840
helped to grow by this divine Power,

36:42.080 --> 36:43.920
which is all-pervading.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.400
May God bless you all.
