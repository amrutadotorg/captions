1
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:39,760
Today 
we are going 

2
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:53,050
to worship Shri Ganesha.
Shri Ganesha resides in Mooladhara, on the

3
00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:07,460
chakra, Mooladhara chakra. And not on mooladhar.
In the mooladhar is placed the Kundalini.

4
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:20,650
She is the mother of Shri Ganesh, we call
her Gauri. Yesterday you saw the picture,

5
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:41,869
the drama, how Shri Ganesha got his head of
an elephant. All these things have happened

6
00:01:41,869 --> 00:02:07,909
in another world. There 
are many worlds of which we know of this world,

7
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:24,910
is a question of our awareness. Now we are
at a human awareness, and we have risen to

8
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:41,959
a higher awareness which is called as the
fourth dimension. Without Shri Ganesha it

9
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:57,720
is not possible. As you know he is the symbol
of innocence within us. This innocence never

10
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:13,760
gets destroyed because it is eternal. But
it may happen that it will get covered with

11
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,870
some clouds by our mistakes that we commit.
But once you get your realization, your innocence

12
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,519
is re-established, it manifests. And you become
innocent, your attention becomes innocent.

13
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,519
It is impossible to follow your religion,
either Christ or Mohammed-Sahib or Jews, if

14
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,670
you do not have enlightenment.This is one
thing they did not realize, because they were

15
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,500
of a very high level people. They did not
know what is the condition of human beings.

16
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,090
As in the Bible is written that if your right
eye commits sins – means goes against Shri

17
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,739
Ganesha- you take it away. Or if your right
hand does anything wrong against Shri Ganesha

18
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,329
, then cut it out. Just imagine, if Christians
were really practising Christianity, they

19
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:45,079
all would have been without hands, without
eyes. Because it is said that if you make

20
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:54,160
any mistakes you better cut out, yourself.
Christ said that you should do it, and also

21
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:02,940
for men he was very strict, not for women
so much. So Mohammed-Saheb thought , that

22
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,330
why not say about women also? Why not restrict
them, why only men? So he made strict rules

23
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,630
for women also. In this case he said that
you should hurt the woman or hit the woman

24
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,709
or should try to restrict the woman, that
is on the husband. But to do so, the husband

25
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,390
himself has to be an innocent person. If he
himself committed such mistakes, then what

26
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:29,500
right he has got to become strict with his
wife or with his sister? And the worst thing

27
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,340
was, were the Jews, when Moses brought the
Ten Commandments, he found that the Jews were

28
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,300
having a decadent society as they have now.

29
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,580
Nowadays we have this decadent society in
America, in.. everywhere. There are no morals,

30
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,810
and nobody talks of morality. I feel that
Sahaj is the only way where human beings can

31
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,979
become innocent. Because Jews were given what
you call the Sheriat (sp?). Where it was , if

32
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,230
you are a thief , cut your hands, cut your
nose, cut this portion, cut that portion…

33
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,650
it’s very serious. I saw that it is impossible
to follow them because they are too pure,

34
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,650
too important.

35
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,979
If you are Christians, you can’t have two
eyes, you can’t have your hands. And if

36
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:15,080
you are Muslims, your wives and your daughters
and your sisters are always in danger. And

37
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,400
if you are a Jew then all kinds of punishments
are written for them. On the contrary , only

38
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,389
the saints have been punished. All the good
people are punished. Because there are so

39
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,360
many people who are extremely aggressive and
sinful. And they also do not know that there

40
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,770
is wrong with them , something very much against
the dharma, against the religion.

41
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,710
With Sahaj only , you get the light of the
spirit. Shri Ganesha is the spirit within

42
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,169
us. And he incarnated on this earth as our
lord Jesus Christ. But all kinds of things

43
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,669
have been done against such great people.
And they made separate religions. None of

44
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,530
these books have separated themselves from
each other. For example, Mohammed-Saheb has

45
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,490
described about Moses, Abraham, Christ, Mother
of Christ. So he never established another

46
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,990
religion, he was talking about all the religions
woven together in one. But we have now people

47
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,099
who do not believe that all the religions
are born out of one tree of spirituality.

48
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:09,990
They are not only fighting with others, but
among themselves. In the name of God they

49
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,830
are killing so many people.

50
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,030
Innocence is the source of love. Like small
children , when you see them sweetly dancing,

51
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:25,360
you feel such tremendous love for them. When
you see a little baby, very sweet baby smiling

52
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,540
at you, you feel tremendous love for that
child. If you do not respect your innocence,

53
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:38,099
you can never be a loving person. And without
love you cannot know truth. Only thing is

54
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:43,689
that we feel rather sometimes awkward, sometimes
frightened, to love the innocent people. The

55
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:47,319
innocent are most harmless people. I do not
like parents to beat their children at all.

56
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:54,340
They are in innocence do something, so you
must be really kind to them, and understand

57
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:03,460
them. Nowadays, in Russia also, there are
many children who are born realized. Because

58
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,509
you all are now enlightened, and there are
so many great saints who want to be born.

59
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:15,590
But you have to be innocent yourself. The
countries where the children are not respected,

60
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:23,960
children don’t want to be born there. There
is a minus growth in those countries. But

61
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,810
in a country like India, where there is so
much love for children, they want to take

62
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,669
birth in India though there is poverty. Children
don’t understand money and material things.

63
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:32,669
They understand love.

64
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,900
If you don’t have love in your heart, Shri
Ganesha cannot shine within you. Now the difference

65
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,490
between a mother and a mother who is very
angry with her children is this: the mother

66
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,770
who loves her child, enjoys everything she
has to do for her child, while the mother

67
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,440
who doesn’t love the child feels that she
is doing too much, she can’t do it, it’s

68
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:03,479
too much. If you ask her what’s the matter
, she will say I have to wash this, I have

69
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,430
to clean this, I have to look after this child,
all kinds of stories. But a mother who is

70
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,680
enlightened will love doing all that, and
enjoy it. She will have respect for her children,

71
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,289
and she will make them respectable. There
is no need to be harsh with your children.

72
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:28,150
Children are very sensitive and intelligent.
Maybe among thousands you might find one child

73
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,289
who is not so good. But later on , they pick
up things from elders, especially from parents,

74
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,490
and from the atmosphere, and they start becoming
troublesome.

75
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,950
That doesn’t mean that you should not control
and restrict your children, and train them.

76
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,370
Best way is to be yourself innocent and dharmic.
Ganesha is the basis of morality. Moral behavior,

77
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,919
when it is lost in a society, that society
becomes destroyed. Whatever maybe the economic

78
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,890
advantages they have, or they have financial
advantages, or political advantages, but,

79
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,190
they get destroyed from within. For example,
take the case of America, which is supposed

80
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,420
to be an affluent country. Which is doubtful
to me that they are affluent, because they

81
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,480
are indebted. But what is happening there?
Small children of twelve years are killing

82
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,570
and selling drugs. In some other countries
in the west, so many children are killed by

83
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,920
the parents. Every country which is affluent
has some sort of a specialty of immorality.

84
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,740
They are absolutely violent people, arrogant
and egoistical. Innocence, first of all, absolutely

85
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,829
dissolves the ego. And when you talk to children
they make such sweet comments, such intelligent

86
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:22,120
comments, that you are amazed how they are
saying all these things. They are extremely

87
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
affectionate, and extremely kind.

88
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,430
I’ll tell you a story of some friends went
to see the grave of president of America,

89
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:36,230
Kennedy. So the child was looking at it, you
see, and everybody was very solemn. Then the

90
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,959
child turned to his father and mother and
said “Mommy, why should you put this president

91
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,060
under the earth, all the worms will eat him
up.. Why this punishment?” There are so

92
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,079
many things which you can see from these children
when they talk, how they describe about other

93
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,149
people. One day we had gone to the airport,
and one child was doing like that, like that.

94
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:01,320
So I said, “What are you doing?” He said
, “I am trying to tie up these people, they

95
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,120
are all off their heads.” Like yesterday’s
swadisthana chakra, they were. So children

96
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,040
see also the game, and the whole drama is
absurd. They are very innocent and so its

97
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,490
the easiest thing to give them good manners.
In the case of Shri Ganesha, you have heard

98
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,810
about the story that they had given – the
parents, the father specially- said that the

99
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:27,649
one who will go around the mother earth, I’ll
give him some present. And Shri Ganesha thought

100
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:33,079
that look at this Kartikkeya, he can go faster
because he’s going on this peacock, which

101
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:41,149
is a bird, which can fly, what about me? I’m
just going on a little rat. But as he is the

102
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:47,600
source of all wisdom , in his wise wisdom
he thought, “My mother is greater than this

103
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,130
mother earth . ” So he went three times
around his mother, and he got the present.

104
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,070
A person who is innocent is extremely humble.
He doesn’t try to show off . He doesn’t

105
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:06,110
know how to show off. For example, Shri Ganesha
has a little rat as his conveyance. But if

106
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:17,519
you see people who are show offs, they try
to buy cars beyond their means, with big loans,

107
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,830
just to show off that they are rich. This
is a disease of people who are not innocent.

108
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:31,740
And people take advantage of this very much
in the world. Like in the west, you see, they

109
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,240
have designers. And they put their stamp as
designers. And one has to pay a lot for that.

110
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:47,600
So if it is on the coat written the designer’s
name, they always try to show like that, while

111
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:57,190
going on the road. But nowadays, they are
putting the sign here, of the designer. Is

112
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,180
a very much in the west, not so much in Russia,
but it will come. And the enrepreneurs take

113
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,450
full advantage of it.

114
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,870
That way I must say Indians are very very
wise. Not all, but most of them. And because

115
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,509
they believe in Shri Ganesha, they would not
waste their money for showing off. So thus

116
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:21,400
the entrepreneurs take full advantage of the
people who try to show off.

117
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:30,060
Innocent person is not bothered about his
own body. About any fashions or about any

118
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:37,660
additions to his body, like people wear things
just to show off. I’m just telling you because

119
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,890
all this nonsense is coming to your country.
I hope you people will understand that the

120
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,959
greatest quality of beauty of personality
is innocence. When the innocence is lost,

121
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,889
people play into the hands of these designers
who make funny clothes. They make clothes

122
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,430
for women which expose their bodies. And the
more it exposes, the more it is expensive.

123
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:06,880
And despite all the cold, they try to wear
clothes which are very scanty. And you can’t

124
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,699
even look at them. But they think no end of
themselves. And all our films in the west

125
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:20,269
are so horrible now that you just don’t
want to see. If they make some films out of

126
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:24,730
children which are innocent, I tell you they
can earn a lot of money.

127
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:33,050
The foundation of dharma is Shri Ganesh. If
you see children, they don’t know how to

128
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:39,279
tell lies, very difficult. And they say things
sometimes which might be embarassing. Like

129
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,160
one mother was saying in the presence of the
child to her husband that the man who is coming

130
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:54,580
in the evening, he eats like a hog. So this
boy heard it and when that gentleman came

131
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:04,120
and started eating , he was looking at him.
And then he says, “Mother, he doesn’t

132
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:13,720
eat like a hog, why did you say that he eats
like a hog? You should not tell lies.” And

133
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:21,310
the mother was so embarassed. So they minimize
also, innocent person by his innocence minimizes

134
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,350
the judgement of others and criticism of others.
Because they don’t see things which normally

135
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:32,610
a person who is immoral can see. Or who is
not innocent can see. I remember my own granddaughter

136
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,399
once she saw a lady in a swimming dress. It
was a picture. So she said “Hey, you go

137
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,740
and dress up properly, otherwise my grandma
will be angry with you.

138
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,829
So when you see all these small little children
talking, the way they behave, the way they

139
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:50,980
are innocent, you really enjoy because innocence
is the source of love. And it is the source

140
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,250
of joy. Because if you do not have love , you
cannot enjoy anything. And you start criticising

141
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,610
and judging and wasting your energy on nonsensical
things. Like the other day I was listening

142
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,550
to some good music, and the gentleman was
singing with his hands, a little bit more

143
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:11,790
of action. But he had closed his eyes and
music was wonderful. I really got lost into

144
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:19,029
it. But there were some ladies who said what
clothes he was wearing, how he was putting

145
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:25,560
his hands, all these superficial things they
were saying, not the essence. But innocence

146
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,750
takes to the essence. And the essence is love.
Thus we have to understand that the quality

147
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,490
of Ganesha we must all imbibe within ourselves.
His quality of innocence which is already

148
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,190
there within us has to be manifested. Like
I was with one sahaja yogi in his house, and

149
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,060
we had a meeting there of about 25 people.
And the meeting was over, I thought that he

150
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,360
had said that I’ll have my dinner there.
So I just waited for all of them to go away.

151
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:04,269
This gentleman was in the kitchen when they
all went away. He came back and he said, “Mother

152
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:09,200
what have you done?Why have they gone? I have
cooked for all of them.” And tears came

153
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:16,820
into his eyes. I was so much overwhelmed by
his generosity, by his kindness. And when

154
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,750
the generosity is done innocently, you are
not even aware of what you are doing. You

155
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,329
just enjoy your generosity, and you don’t
bother as to see what is the reaction of another

156
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,329
person.

157
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:35,389
We have in our shastras description of such
people. Like Shri Rama, he went into the forest

158
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:39,290
and there was a very old lady of, what you
call, a tribal area. Very old, only she had

159
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,673
two teeth left. Her name was Shabari. And
she came before Shri Ram and offered him some

160
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:49,850
plums, you can say, pears. And she very innocently
told him, “See, all these I have tested

161
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,970
with my teeth and those who are sour I have
thrown away because you don’t like sour

162
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,610
ones. But they are all sweet.” Normally
in India people don’t eat anything which

163
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,980
has been touched by another mouth. So Shri
Ram says “Oh , I see, you have done this

164
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:07,350
work, so please may I have all these?” But
his brother Lakshmana was angry, what is this

165
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,860
lady she has no manners? So when she started
putting this pear into the mouth of Shri Rama

166
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,100
, he was getting even worse. So she said “See
how carefully I have done this testing and

167
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,120
you are enjoying , otherwise you would not
have enjoyed them.”

168
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,850
And here Lakshmana was getting angry, very
angry. So Shri Rama says, “Oh, what wonderful

169
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,610
fruits, I have never eaten such fruits in
my lifetime.” So his wife Sita she said

170
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,800
“Why don’t you give me some?” He said
“No, no these are for me, I can’t give

171
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,370
you.” So Sitaji said that “After all,
I am your wife, and you have to share everything

172
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:41,520
with me.” So he said, “All right, as a
matter of right, I am giving you.” So he

173
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:50,090
gave those pears, those fruits to her.
So Sita said, “What ? This is just like

174
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:59,200
ambrosia, such beautiful fruits I have never
eaten!” So she tells her brother in law,

175
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,640
“See, what fruits, these are heavenly fruits!”
So he got tempted. So Lakshmana said, “Give

176
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,610
me some to taste also.” So Sitaji said “No
no no, I am not going to share, after all,

177
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:21,980
I have got it with great difficulty from your
brother, I am not going to share.” So Shri

178
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,600
Rama said, “all right, give him some.”
So this innocent old lady says, “No, I have

179
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,110
some more, I can give him. You can have your
share, I have some more, I can give him.”

180
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:46,010
And she gave it to Lakshmana. He started eating
and he really enjoyed, so much he enjoyed,

181
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,310
he said “My god, I have never eaten such
beautiful fruits.” Even Shri Krishna, whenever

182
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:54,900
he used to go to the capital of Hastinapur,
he would not live with the kings there, with

183
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,310
Duryodana, but with Vidura, who was the son
of a maidservant. Because Vidura was an enlightened

184
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:05,840
man, and he used to respect Vidura much more
than anybody else.

185
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:14,170
But sometimes a mistake we commit that we
get too much attached to innocent children.

186
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:20,843
Give them too much importance. Innocence is
like a river flowing, but if you try to stagnate

187
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:24,520
it then the children get spoiled. They must
be respected, but one should not try to make

188
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,050
them look like something very exceptional.
They are all just the same, they have certain

189
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:37,590
various facets, but I have seen, children
are just the same. Firstly, they never get

190
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:43,630
bored. If you are innocent you will never
be bored, you see beauty all the time, and

191
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,970
even if you are alone you enjoy yourself.
It is only the grownups get bored. Now supposing

192
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,310
you are in the airport and its late, and the
plane is late. All the others, all the older

193
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,240
people will be very upset. But children will
start playing with something that is in the

194
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,430
airport – anything, a railing is there,
or a steps are there, they will go up and

195
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,590
down, enjoy themselves. They don’t want
to make a sort of a life miserable by just

196
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,480
bringing everything to some meticulous definition.
I have seen in the airport many a times people

197
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:23,500
just feeling very bored and terrible and while
the children are running up and down and playing

198
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,510
and enjoying and making friends with other
children whom they have never met. Only by

199
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,490
innocence you can transcend your limited ideas.

200
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:41,310
I have seen parents who are extremely racist.
Their children take to other people in no

201
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:50,230
time. An innocent person is like that. He
just can carry on with any type of person

202
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:56,190
without even thinking what sort of a color
he has, what sort of face he has, or what

203
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:04,270
sort of hair he has done. These things do
not matter. These are superficial. But children

204
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:14,710
do not bother about superficial things. They
just want to see the heart of the person.

205
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:22,070
If the person is loving, whatever may be the
race, religion, anything, children will jump.

206
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:30,350
I’ve already told you 
that innocence dissolves the ego. Innocent

207
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:37,170
person cannot be aggressive. And if the aggression
is there that is also very loving aggression.

208
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:44,070
Like a child would come and say that ” Why
don’t you give my clothes to this boy?”

209
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:58,470
And if you say, “Oh God, I paid so much
money and you want to give it to this boy?”

210
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:12,030
So he’ll say “Alright, next time again
you buy for me, but let me give this to this

211
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:18,650
boy” innocently. Innocent children do not
have sense of possession. Also they do not

212
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:25,110
hesitate to share their things if they are
innocent. But if they are brought up in a

213
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:40,170
way that they show that “This is yours and
this should be kept as yours” all the time

214
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,630
put into his head that this is yours, then
they start becoming possessive of their things.

215
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:55,430
The best thing to enjoy is to live with children.
And to be like them. And to enjoy them. This

216
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:03,240
is how our innocence gets nourishment. In
Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people become really

217
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,890
very innocent. Shri Ganesha who is on the
backside of your head also, who is MahaGanesha

218
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:19,090
here, starts acting on the eyes. The lust
and greed from the eyes just drop out, because

219
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:25,580
you become innocent in your attention. So
you don’t have to take out your eyes as

220
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,890
Christ has said. Nor you have to cut your
hands. Because you really become moral. I

221
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,510
don’t know how many of you know that all
of you have become saints. As Ganesha was

222
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,290
created, you are also created as innocent
saints. Try to respect your innocence. That

223
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:50,300
will make you feel young and happy.
Is a , in India, in Maharastra, we have eight

224
00:23:50,300 --> 00:24:04,560
swayambu Ganeshas. And I have seen the people
of Maharastra are quite innocent. Somehow,

225
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:14,730
its a very ancient country, and in that area
specially Shri Ganesha is worshipped, so people

226
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:22,000
have become very innocent.
They have a Ganesha being established during

227
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:51,110
certain time, now is the time, for ten days.
Made out of clay and later on is put in the

228
00:24:51,110 --> 00:25:01,380
water, sea or river. But as this Coca cola
culture has also come to India, in the presence

229
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:11,670
of Shri Ganesha they were singing horrible
vulgar song and drinking in his presence.

230
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:21,860
These were all public Ganeshas, you see. So
I warned them in two lectures, that don’t

231
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:29,190
do this, because if Shri Ganesha gets angry,
y u will get earthquakes. They would not believe

232
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:45,060
me.
So third year these people in a village, quite

233
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:58,480
a big place, went to the Ganesha resurgion,
means where they put it Ganesha 

234
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:11,860
in the water, and they came back. And they
were all drunk and they were dancing in the

235
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:20,420
night. And suddenly this great earthquake
came in, and all of them were buried. Except

236
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:33,910
for Sahaja Yogis, and the Sahaja Yoga Center
which was there was not at all hit by the

237
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:44,130
earthquake. And there was a big gap round
the Center, so the people ran toward the Center

238
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:56,970
that they can be saved. But they all fell
in that big gap and died.

239
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:14,230
So on the other side, the innocence is very
powerful. Anybody who tries to molest or to

240
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:26,250
try to destroy somebody’s innocence is ultimately
very badly punished by Shri Ganesha. Those

241
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:36,840
people who do not worship Ganesha in their
heart can become right- sided or can become

242
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,430
left-sided. If they become right-sided they
get all kinds of diseases, which are more

243
00:27:44,430 --> 00:28:52,410
physical. And if they become left sided then
they get diseases which are psycho-somatic.

244
00:28:52,410 --> 00:29:36,360
Which are incurable. We have had some horrible
people 

245
00:29:36,360 --> 00:30:00,060
in our country who preached that through mooladhara
chakra , through sex, you can raise the kundalini.

246
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:15,710
And they became tantrikas. People who were
tantrikas did all kinds of horrible things

247
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:41,360
in the temples they put erotics, insult to
Shri Ganesha. They 

248
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,520
are all now being destroyed.

249
00:30:46,520 --> 00:31:48,580
So one should never try to challenge a person
who is innocent, who has the blessings of

250
00:31:48,580 --> 00:37:16,319
Shri Ganesha. Only through enlightenment one
can awaken Shri Ganesha within yourself.

251
00:37:16,319 --> 01:00:12,889
May God Bless You All.
