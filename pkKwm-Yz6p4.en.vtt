00:01.931 --> 00:03.900
Warren: They are just asking questions, Mother.

00:04.101 --> 00:06.064
Shri Mataji: What kind? Warren: Just practical.

00:06.265 --> 00:08.140
Shri Mataji: Practical? That’s good,

00:08.738 --> 00:11.207
practical questions are very good.

00:27.405 --> 00:29.695
Warren: Would you like to talk to them for a while?

00:29.895 --> 00:31.578
Shri Mataji: First I talk to them and then

00:31.779 --> 00:34.140
ask the questions.

00:40.053 --> 00:42.499
I am overjoyed to see you all here.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.580
Actually the whole night I was working

00:44.780 --> 00:46.500
on Melbourne seekers,

00:46.701 --> 00:49.368
that they should come today and

00:49.568 --> 00:52.980
should establish their realisation very well.

00:54.994 --> 00:57.549
Now we have to understand

00:57.749 --> 01:00.669
a few things about Sahaja Yoga very clearly

01:00.869 --> 01:03.860
and there is no compromise on these few things

01:04.060 --> 01:05.820
that we have to accept.

01:06.265 --> 01:07.916
Because, as I told you,

01:08.117 --> 01:10.062
Truth cannot compromise for you,

01:10.263 --> 01:12.700
you have to compromise for Truth.

01:12.981 --> 01:14.836
So the first is that

01:15.037 --> 01:17.976
Sahaja Yoga is not just a precept,

01:18.176 --> 01:19.980
is not just a precept:

01:20.180 --> 01:21.704
it is practice.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.115
It is not just a mental idea.

01:25.316 --> 01:27.820
Now you got realisation, all right,

01:28.020 --> 01:29.420
but it is not sufficient.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.354
Even if you think that you got realisation so, now,

01:32.554 --> 01:35.500
you are all right, you become the Spirit,

01:37.498 --> 01:40.620
all right; but still, it is more a mental conception

01:40.820 --> 01:43.860
than a real identification.

01:44.342 --> 01:46.220
So it is not that

01:48.085 --> 01:50.780
if you get your realisation, and you start the

01:50.980 --> 01:53.500
awakening of your Kundalini, starts very well.

01:53.701 --> 01:55.992
Still, it is

01:56.192 --> 01:58.940
to be understood that it is the practice of Sahaja Yoga

01:59.140 --> 02:02.234
which is more important than the precept of it.

02:03.235 --> 02:05.464
There are many people in India

02:05.664 --> 02:07.715
who can’t read or write,

02:08.770 --> 02:11.899
who don’t have all these mental activities as you have

02:12.131 --> 02:14.740
and are not so complicated as you are;

02:14.940 --> 02:17.259
some of them are aboriginal people,

02:17.459 --> 02:20.285
just living in the villages, very simple people.

02:21.288 --> 02:23.340
They get realisation,

02:24.572 --> 02:28.419
they feel the joy much faster than the complicated ones will

02:28.638 --> 02:32.220
and they just start working on it. You have to work it out.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.860
This is not the compassion that speaks, talks,

02:36.465 --> 02:40.160
elaborates and advertises, but it works.

02:40.580 --> 02:44.300
Sahaja Yoga is a thing that works, the religion that works.

02:44.782 --> 02:47.522
And this is what we must understand first of all,

02:47.723 --> 02:50.780
that it is not the talking, it is not the

02:54.993 --> 02:58.107
precept that you are a great soul:

02:58.641 --> 03:00.435
you have to become.

03:01.251 --> 03:04.678
Not that you are not, you are. But you have to be aware of it.

03:04.878 --> 03:07.378
More light has to flow into you.

03:07.723 --> 03:10.995
Definitely, you must be something special to get it, no doubt.

03:11.196 --> 03:12.817
But you must allow

03:13.207 --> 03:15.740
your lamp to be cleared out,

03:15.940 --> 03:18.740
cleansed, so that more light is given.

03:19.246 --> 03:21.700
And it works wonders for people

03:21.900 --> 03:24.020
who honestly want to ascend

03:24.220 --> 03:25.620
in spirituality.

03:26.595 --> 03:30.110
As I told you before also that it is a concept

03:30.742 --> 03:34.180
many people have that Sahaja Yoga cures people.

03:34.524 --> 03:36.024
It is not true.

03:36.225 --> 03:39.140
It is just as a by-product it may cure you;

03:39.716 --> 03:41.415
just as a by-product.

03:42.048 --> 03:45.380
So one must understand the blessing has come to you

03:45.580 --> 03:47.152
only because

03:48.253 --> 03:50.123
you are a seeker,

03:50.689 --> 03:54.327
you have done a lot of good in your past life and this life also

03:54.601 --> 03:58.088
and that God has chosen you to be in His Kingdom.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.180
But it cannot be demanding, you cannot demand,

04:03.852 --> 04:05.780
you cannot demand anything from God,

04:05.980 --> 04:08.900
He has to give you because He knows what you deserve.

04:09.102 --> 04:11.782
And He gives you much, much, much more than what you deserve.

04:11.983 --> 04:13.830
I mean, I have seen people who have been in

04:14.030 --> 04:16.060
Sahaja Yoga that after one year they start asking,

04:16.260 --> 04:19.020
“Mother, what did we do to deserve all this?”.

04:19.916 --> 04:22.660
They just can’t believe it. I said, “Must be something,

04:22.860 --> 04:24.780
you must know there must be something

04:24.980 --> 04:27.380
that the blessings have come to you”.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.766
This is one thing that one has to understand

04:30.966 --> 04:34.220
that you cannot make Sahaja Yoga compromise for you,

04:34.420 --> 04:37.980
you have to understand all the techniques and things

04:38.180 --> 04:39.718
about Sahaja Yoga.

04:39.918 --> 04:42.580
Now the thing could be that you may start doubting,

04:42.780 --> 04:45.580
you see, so that’s what we have people who

04:45.780 --> 04:48.290
are doubting about it and doing all kinds of things; you see,

04:48.490 --> 04:51.300
in the beginning, they are rather slow movers.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.067
So we have to sort them out, to begin with, because the second

04:55.552 --> 04:58.580
stage of awareness is doubtless awareness:

04:59.765 --> 05:01.794
you are doubtless about yourself,

05:01.994 --> 05:04.603
doubtless about the working of Sahaja Yoga,

05:04.803 --> 05:06.780
doubtless about God’s existence,

05:06.980 --> 05:08.613
doubtless about His Laws.

05:08.813 --> 05:11.907
You become absolutely doubtless, not mentally, it’s a state,

05:12.107 --> 05:14.060
it’s a state of your being

05:14.260 --> 05:17.380
by which you achieve lots of

05:18.206 --> 05:21.124
results and you really become powerful:

05:21.324 --> 05:23.420
you can see your compassion so powerful,

05:23.620 --> 05:25.504
so discrete, so understanding,

05:25.704 --> 05:27.998
so forbearing. And you are amazed of yourself,

05:28.198 --> 05:30.107
you really become a saint

05:30.308 --> 05:33.340
in the real sense of the word, that you become humble,

05:33.541 --> 05:35.137
flowering,

05:35.338 --> 05:37.820
beautifully, not taking anything

05:38.020 --> 05:41.620
aggressive upon yourself; and you are really

05:41.820 --> 05:45.478
in the Kingdom of God that you
feel that you are looked after, protected,

05:45.678 --> 05:49.300
guided, blessed, every moment you walk along.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.373
And that’s the state everybody should aspire

05:53.933 --> 05:55.795
to reach this doubtless awareness;

05:55.995 --> 05:58.369
and unless and until you reach that state,

05:58.570 --> 06:00.700
we don’t call you Sahaja Yogi,

06:00.901 --> 06:02.693
you may start calling yourself,

06:02.893 --> 06:04.426
but that’s left to yourself.

06:04.627 --> 06:07.906
There are not sort of… we do not have sort of certification,

06:08.106 --> 06:11.001
or things going on; or we do not give any written

06:11.201 --> 06:13.215
certificates to people, nothing of the kind.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.903
It is you who have to certify yourself.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.755
So gradually people grow up

06:20.100 --> 06:22.100
into beautiful beings.

06:22.369 --> 06:23.773
They start

06:23.974 --> 06:26.320
having their self esteem fully established,

06:26.520 --> 06:28.092
understanding themselves.

06:28.293 --> 06:30.740
But practice of Sahaja Yoga must be done

06:30.940 --> 06:32.474
without thinking too much about it.

06:32.674 --> 06:35.061
First, you just try it, more trying

06:35.261 --> 06:37.060
– because if you start doubting, I tell you,

06:37.260 --> 06:39.101
your progress will be much less.

06:39.528 --> 06:42.399
So first, just like a scientist, to try to

06:42.600 --> 06:45.100
accept one by… there is nothing that has to be done,

06:45.300 --> 06:47.556
you do not have to pay Me anything, of course,

06:47.756 --> 06:50.847
you do not have to do any acrobatics or anything.

06:51.048 --> 06:53.420
But for example a small thing like my photograph, you see,

06:53.620 --> 06:55.260
many people say, “Why Your photograph?”

06:55.460 --> 06:58.300
So “Use your photograph,” I say, if that works out, you see.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.220
It is something surprising: that’s how people challenging Me

07:01.420 --> 07:03.020
“Why Your photograph?”. “Why not use yours?

07:03.220 --> 07:06.540
I will be very happy, use anybody’s”
but doesn’t work out, what to do now?

07:06.740 --> 07:08.674
It’s My photograph that works out, but

07:08.874 --> 07:11.780
even if you do not like it, you have to use it – what can I do?

07:13.700 --> 07:15.740
Is as simple like that, you see,

07:15.940 --> 07:17.900
but in that, I do not gain anything from you,

07:18.100 --> 07:20.980
I do not want anything from you, nothing material

07:21.180 --> 07:23.006
that you can give Me.

07:23.206 --> 07:26.899
But you will enjoy, you will enjoy My love, you will enjoy.

07:27.099 --> 07:29.980
It is all for your own enjoyment, everything is done.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.660
And this is a special time we are born in,

07:32.860 --> 07:35.100
we have a special responsibility.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.724
Today we had a lady who came,

07:37.924 --> 07:41.124
her husband came, and they were saying that

07:42.120 --> 07:44.900
“We had a son who was very well equipped

07:45.100 --> 07:48.460
and he went to one of the gurus and he got completely ruined.”

07:48.879 --> 07:50.381
And this particular guru

07:50.581 --> 07:53.420
we need to be rather careful about, it’s this Rajaneesh fellow.

07:53.620 --> 07:55.732
His disciples are rather difficult.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.220
They come to Sahaja Yoga, all right, but they are a very

07:58.420 --> 08:00.346
extreme type of people.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.142
They come with a great force to Sahaja Yoga, again go back;

08:03.342 --> 08:06.326
so all those who have been to Rajaneesh and have taken his initiation,

08:06.526 --> 08:09.940
have to be extremely careful. All of you who have been to gurus

08:10.140 --> 08:13.100
must know that they will be again and again attacked.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.140
So you need to be rather

08:15.340 --> 08:17.660
patient with yourselves as we are with you,

08:17.860 --> 08:21.100
and must know that you must assert your will power a little bit,

08:21.300 --> 08:23.660
to come up, and shed off all that

08:23.860 --> 08:27.300
was screwed into your head…

08:27.500 --> 08:30.060
and you paid for it, you see. Forget it.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.660
Some time people say that “We have paid for it, so better have it”.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.340
That’s not the way. You’d better through it away.

08:36.540 --> 08:40.020
It is horrible, you have bought a snake on your head, on your neck.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.808
So just through away all these things that they have put

08:43.008 --> 08:44.466
you on.

08:44.666 --> 08:47.580
You all forget it and become your Self, first of all,

08:47.780 --> 08:50.660
and become your own guru. Ask your vibrations,

08:50.860 --> 08:53.740
develop your vibratory awareness and grow with it.

08:54.416 --> 08:56.860
Some people will find also that

08:57.060 --> 08:59.278
their vibrations are not showing

08:59.478 --> 09:02.540
very good results, some of you will find that kind of thing.

09:03.702 --> 09:05.247
And when you find

09:05.447 --> 09:07.980
that your vibrations are not

09:08.180 --> 09:11.740
working out in your hands and
things, you should not get worried about it.

09:11.940 --> 09:14.060
Maybe your Vishuddhi chakra is not all right.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.460
There are ways and methods to
improve your Vishuddhi chakra, by which

09:17.660 --> 09:19.491
you know the exact

09:20.025 --> 09:21.630
mantras to be said

09:21.831 --> 09:24.715
and how to improve it; and we also

09:24.915 --> 09:27.660
vibrated oil and all that, you can apply here.

09:27.860 --> 09:31.433
And also there are other methods
by which you can improve your sinus.

09:31.633 --> 09:35.339
And if you have any problem with the
Vishuddhi because of over-smoking or anything,

09:35.540 --> 09:37.060
there are so many ways

09:37.260 --> 09:40.500
which you can call the
Grandmother’s medicine, simple, simple things

09:40.700 --> 09:43.020
which will work it out, should try to clear out.

09:43.220 --> 09:45.780
So whatever centre is not working out,

09:45.980 --> 09:47.860
you should get after that and

09:48.060 --> 09:51.152
don’t worry about the centres that are
good because those who are good are good.

09:51.352 --> 09:54.460
So we have to look after the centres which are in trouble

09:54.660 --> 09:58.021
and try to improve our centres and

09:58.772 --> 10:01.886
complete being has to be brought into balance.

10:02.086 --> 10:04.011
Some people have some centres

10:04.211 --> 10:05.700
so badly off that,

10:05.900 --> 10:08.060
despite the fact they have all the centres all right,

10:08.260 --> 10:09.902
because of one centre, you see,

10:10.102 --> 10:13.020
they are in imbalance. So, the first thing in Sahaja Yoga

10:13.220 --> 10:15.286
is to establish a balance.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.550
Now certain things about morality and all that,

10:18.750 --> 10:22.623
I do not want to talk to you; gradually your self will realise

10:22.823 --> 10:24.860
what is good for you and bad for you.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.300
But in Sahaja Yoga, you will be given a proper guidance

10:27.500 --> 10:31.100
as to what is to be done, how to lead a life and

10:31.300 --> 10:33.571
how to have a normal, good

10:33.772 --> 10:36.020
married life, how to have children,

10:36.220 --> 10:39.020
how to look after them, how to get to your parents.

10:39.220 --> 10:40.930
So the social side also

10:41.130 --> 10:44.300
you can learn very well by which you really feel happy.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.340
But the main society that you have is that of Sahaja yogis.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.940
Of course, you do not have to cut off from
anyone, you do not have to give up anyone.

10:52.140 --> 10:54.700
But you grow among your

10:54.900 --> 10:57.740
Sahaja yogis, these are called sajñānas, you see.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.620
“Sa-jñāna”, the people

10:59.820 --> 11:01.860
who are the followers of Truth.

11:02.060 --> 11:05.580
So once you come together, it is a collective happening

11:05.780 --> 11:09.540
and it works out more collectively and it helps you much more.

11:09.740 --> 11:12.790
But if you say “Individually,
Mother, I can do it”, it doesn't work out.

11:12.990 --> 11:15.051
In Sahaja Yoga, I have seen, you do not go too far.

11:15.252 --> 11:18.431
You all have to work it together, you have to meet.

11:18.631 --> 11:20.660
Luckily, you have a very good ashram here.

11:20.860 --> 11:24.620
You all can come and meditate and
take a proper help from these people.

11:24.820 --> 11:26.987
God has already blessed this place so much.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.900
And when I came to Melbourne,

11:29.100 --> 11:31.454
I stayed in a very small little house, with, I think,

11:31.654 --> 11:33.820
two bedrooms and some sort of a thing like that.

11:34.020 --> 11:37.396
And this time I find a big, huge thing given to you,

11:37.596 --> 11:40.860
and they may start here also a nice school for

11:41.864 --> 11:43.420
small children here.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.660
Your small children can go to that school

11:45.860 --> 11:47.500
where they can be looked after well,

11:47.700 --> 11:49.540
they won’t have any complications.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.903
And everything can be done at a

11:53.104 --> 11:54.604
much better level

11:54.805 --> 11:57.354
than what you find in mundane life.

11:57.609 --> 12:00.260
Everything has a meaning, spiritual meaning,

12:00.460 --> 12:02.620
everything in life has a meaning!

12:02.820 --> 12:06.540
So you should try to find out whatever is good for your ascent

12:06.740 --> 12:08.571
and for your nourishing

12:08.771 --> 12:10.660
of your spiritual being!

12:11.829 --> 12:14.700
I hope next time when I come,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.660
all of you will be great Sahaja Yogis

12:17.861 --> 12:19.740
and will be great people!

12:19.940 --> 12:22.500
Individually everyone will be working out

12:22.700 --> 12:26.549
on many people, and we have to
change the face of Melbourne completely!

12:26.750 --> 12:28.353
May God Bless you all.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.925
So if you have any questions, you ask Me. Now…

12:31.126 --> 12:33.008
Warren: Mother, there was one gentleman – he asked me a question.

12:33.209 --> 12:36.496
He has got a son at home who's;
he is mentally disturbed. He was asking

12:37.274 --> 12:40.154
how he can deal with that. Because he won’t come.

12:40.355 --> 12:43.460
I suggested that first he and his wife should get it.

12:43.660 --> 12:45.820
This gentleman here, in the suit.

12:46.785 --> 12:49.864
Shri Mataji: What’s the problem exactly? What is it called?

12:50.072 --> 12:52.386
Seeker: Well, schizophrenia.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.848
He was very, very religious once upon a time.

12:57.049 --> 12:58.977
Shri Mataji: Where did he go? To what place?

12:59.177 --> 13:02.226
Warren: What religious cult? What religious group?

13:02.427 --> 13:04.340
Seeker: Well, he belongs to the Catholic religion as I am.

13:04.540 --> 13:06.373
Shri Mataji: What is that?

13:07.504 --> 13:09.068
Warren: Catholic, Mother.

13:09.269 --> 13:12.248
He himself is a Catholic and he is a great believer in Christ.

13:12.448 --> 13:14.031
But his son became …

13:15.065 --> 13:18.395
Seeker: He had a love affair which did not go right.

13:18.596 --> 13:22.140
Shri Mataji: With a? Warren: I am just, I am not interrupting, I am just passing on.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.420
She does not hear you too clearly.

13:24.620 --> 13:27.533
He had a love affair and it did not go right.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.308
Shri Mataji: What is his age?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.340
Seeker: Pardon? Shri Mataji: What is his age?

13:31.540 --> 13:33.707
Warren: Age. Seeker: Twenty-four now.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.940
Shri Mataji: Now I don’t want to criticise Catholicism,

13:37.140 --> 13:39.890
I say because as you are a believer of Christ, it is all right.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.500
But there are certain practices they have taken to,

13:42.700 --> 13:45.118
which are quite injurious to human beings.

13:45.318 --> 13:47.836
Seeker: The thing is he is schizophrenic.

13:48.552 --> 13:50.460
That can happen to any Catholic.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.620
Why? See, the reason I will tell you. Please be seated.

13:52.820 --> 13:55.102
If you listen to Me patiently there,

13:55.302 --> 13:57.140
two things which they do very wrong.

13:57.340 --> 13:59.389
One is to build churches

13:59.589 --> 14:01.740
and then put all the dead bodies in it.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.782
It is absolutely absurd you see,

14:03.982 --> 14:06.390
to have a graveyard in the church. Absolutely.

14:06.591 --> 14:09.572
That is so dangerous. Now I have had many Catholic

14:09.772 --> 14:11.272
people coming to Me.

14:11.473 --> 14:14.540
And they had very big problems with two centres.

14:14.852 --> 14:18.679
One is this back centre and another is left this one.

14:19.918 --> 14:23.143
Of course, left Swadishthana is there because it is unauthorised.

14:23.344 --> 14:26.260
They are not realised souls and they cannot preach about God.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.718
They have no authority to preach about God. Or to baptise anyone.

14:30.406 --> 14:33.140
No human being has got the authority to touch this

14:33.340 --> 14:35.780
precious place without being baptised.

14:35.980 --> 14:37.820
They themselves should be really baptised.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.980
Actualisation of baptism is needed.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.919
You think about it, logically.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.208
Anybody can become a priest you see, and you cannot elect them.

14:46.408 --> 14:48.260
It has to come from God, isn’t it?

14:48.460 --> 14:50.500
So that is one thing that is wrong there.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.405
And another thing they are always caught up

14:53.605 --> 14:55.158
is the left Vishuddhi, is here.

14:55.359 --> 14:59.220
When they do this confession business,
you see – who are these priests to confess to?

14:59.420 --> 15:02.220
Actually, I have seen the priests also go mad.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.100
So many priests have come to Me.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.712
Because the people have confessed
to them. And in that confession, poor

15:07.912 --> 15:11.740
– the priests have gone off their heads.
Because they couldn’t bear it anymore you see.

15:11.940 --> 15:15.780
The kind of confessions people did, that –
“I have murdered someone, I have done this and that”.

15:15.980 --> 15:19.100
And they couldn’t keep it you see;
their conscience couldn’t keep it in themselves.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.540
So one has to face it clearly;

15:21.740 --> 15:23.620
anybody can get mad like that.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.420
I have known people who really got very mad.

15:26.620 --> 15:29.060
So one has to understand that

15:29.260 --> 15:31.767
you must get your realisation first of all.

15:32.007 --> 15:34.897
Seeker: Yeah but Mother, I have noticed when I pray,

15:35.879 --> 15:38.580
it has an influence and

15:39.111 --> 15:41.139
he really calms down.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.340
Shri Mataji: He will. Of course, I agree.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.993
Seeker: He hasn't been cured, but it changes him.

15:48.194 --> 15:50.262
Shri Mataji: Must be. Because if you pray to Christ,

15:50.462 --> 15:52.570
He will definitely help. But not through your church.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.693
What I am saying, must be…

15:55.415 --> 15:58.036
Seeker: I am a believer in Christ. Shri Mataji: That’s all right.

15:58.236 --> 16:01.085
Then it’s all right. But what I am saying, that,

16:01.285 --> 16:03.619
to get a complete connection with God

16:03.820 --> 16:06.740
or with Christ, you have to be born again, isn’t it?

16:06.940 --> 16:08.799
So you must get your realisation. Seeker: Yes.

16:08.999 --> 16:12.420
Shri Mataji: And if you can get your
realisation, you can help your son immensely.

16:12.620 --> 16:13.820
Seeker: That is what I want.

16:14.020 --> 16:17.300
Shri Mataji: So you all must get realisation. All parents

16:17.500 --> 16:19.545
who are interested in their children;

16:19.745 --> 16:22.540
all children who are interested in their parents,

16:22.740 --> 16:25.500
must get their realisation. Seeker: I want to tell you Mother,

16:25.700 --> 16:28.140
that since he became sick four years ago,

16:28.340 --> 16:30.620
I have turned to Christ more than ever.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.780
And I have found very great comfort.

16:32.980 --> 16:35.540
And I have found all the answers.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.747
That is why I want to help You.

16:37.950 --> 16:41.180
Shri Mataji: Yes, but one thing must
be - Seeker: I know that this life is a lie.

16:41.380 --> 16:44.244
The life we are leading is a lie. I know that.

16:45.418 --> 16:48.260
Shri Mataji: So you must get
your realisation and understand Christ

16:48.460 --> 16:50.516
and in a better way, in a fuller way,

16:50.716 --> 16:52.780
in a real way, how He helps you.

16:52.980 --> 16:54.606
Otherwise, you cannot understand Him.

16:54.806 --> 16:58.140
Superficially how far can you go? He’s been kind to you,

16:58.340 --> 17:00.180
but now you have to be

17:00.380 --> 17:02.960
more realistic about it. All right?

17:03.168 --> 17:05.025
Seeker: That is why I wanted to help of you.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.780
Shri Mataji: No, don’t bring your son.

17:06.980 --> 17:10.286
We can work it out. Have you got a photograph of his?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.620
Seeker: I haven’t got it, but I can bring a photograph.

17:12.820 --> 17:15.340
Shri Mataji: You send Me the photograph. All right? I can work…

17:15.540 --> 17:16.918
Seeker: I send you the photograph.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.714
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s better.
You send Me the photograph, all right.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.074
To our Sydney address. When I'm there…

17:22.275 --> 17:25.700
Seeker: You'll be going. I will give it to one of your - Shri Mataji: No, no. You can give it to one of them.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.081
They will bring it along. All right?

17:28.282 --> 17:31.300
That’s all. Now what else, My child?

17:50.689 --> 17:54.631
Warren: He is asking whether there are
different degrees of Kundalini awakening

17:54.831 --> 17:57.060
because he has heard or read that -

17:57.714 --> 17:59.260
that can be very dangerous.

17:59.460 --> 18:02.940
Shri Mataji: No, no, it’s not. It
is all people who are absolutely;

18:03.140 --> 18:06.227
you see, they – people as I told you the other day that

18:06.427 --> 18:09.140
a person comes from the village and puts his fingers into the

18:09.340 --> 18:12.060
holes of a plug and says it is the electricity

18:12.260 --> 18:14.140
gives you the shock and something like that.

18:14.340 --> 18:16.578
But I, I can assure you that Kundalini is

18:16.778 --> 18:19.242
never, never dangerous. She is your mother.

18:19.442 --> 18:22.610
But, there is another centre down below

18:22.810 --> 18:26.100
which might sometimes give you a little heat

18:26.300 --> 18:28.820
or some sparking in the finger.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.740
Or maybe a little electrical discharge.

18:31.940 --> 18:34.460
For a while. Just for a while. If there is a problem.

18:34.660 --> 18:37.386
On that centre. A little bit, not much.

18:38.019 --> 18:41.190
But you can gradually feel that

18:41.390 --> 18:43.700
cool breeze after the tingling is over.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.402
In the beginning, you might feel a little tingling.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.406
So far I have given realisation, I think,

18:48.606 --> 18:50.879
to so many people. The Sahaja Yoga has worked out so well.

18:51.079 --> 18:53.131
Nobody has suffered. Everybody has gained.

18:53.331 --> 18:56.375
But if you have been to some guru. For example, take,

18:57.280 --> 19:01.220
say, people who have been to say,

19:01.420 --> 19:04.580
Mahesh Yogi. Now, about thirty people came to Me

19:04.780 --> 19:07.139
and only I could save eight of them.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.246
Because of the rest of them; they used to come,

19:09.453 --> 19:11.926
go back, come, go back. Like that,

19:12.207 --> 19:14.860
to that state. I could save only eight of them

19:15.060 --> 19:17.220
because they were so badly damaged you see.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.561
But even, they went back to the lunatic asylum,

19:20.761 --> 19:23.100
this, that – but still they were remembering Me.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.381
I don’t know, they are still coming out,

19:25.581 --> 19:27.686
going in, like that. So they take time.

19:27.886 --> 19:30.641
But it is not, never dangerous. It tries to improve you.

19:30.841 --> 19:33.100
Even when I go you will find

19:33.300 --> 19:35.460
it will rise and gradually tickle you here and there.

19:35.660 --> 19:38.147
It doesn't trouble you at all. It is a very

19:38.347 --> 19:40.580
kind, compassionate mother of yours

19:40.780 --> 19:42.660
who has been with you all your lives.

19:42.860 --> 19:46.300
And now she is anxious to establish your realisation.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.154
She is one who gives your second birth.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.420
So she cannot be unkind.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.138
See, she is your pure mother.

19:52.338 --> 19:55.535
She has no interest in you but to give you your second birth.

19:55.735 --> 19:57.380
And she is your individual mother.

19:57.580 --> 20:01.500
Of course, some of you have
harmed her very much. I have seen her

20:01.700 --> 20:03.540
very much upset.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.249
But doesn’t matter.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.171
She looks after you. She is the one who does all this job.

20:10.371 --> 20:12.300
She is the one who cures you, she is one

20:12.500 --> 20:15.372
who gives you realisation, she is the one who gives you peace,

20:15.572 --> 20:18.060
she is the one who takes you to the Spirit.

20:19.243 --> 20:22.290
All right? So nothing; don’t have any fears.

20:22.491 --> 20:23.870
May God Bless You.

20:24.071 --> 20:26.972
This is all funny people. You see,
everybody has written about Kundalini.

20:27.172 --> 20:28.820
I am Myself, I am amazed.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.100
They had no fear of God, no fear of anything

20:31.300 --> 20:32.940
– all lies, they have written and

20:33.140 --> 20:36.509
those who really suffered must be unauthorised, horrible people

20:36.710 --> 20:39.310
who must have tried. You have to have a proper, holy life, isn’t it?

20:39.510 --> 20:42.099
You have to be a holy person. Because Kundalini

20:42.353 --> 20:44.420
is a kanya,

20:44.620 --> 20:46.833
means a virgin. Now imagine,

20:47.550 --> 20:51.120
they call the sleeping serpent on this

20:51.320 --> 20:54.180
Ayers Rock you see –

20:54.381 --> 20:56.047
for the “kuniya”.

20:56.248 --> 20:58.700
That is what it is – Kundalini is a virgin.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.260
Can you imagine how it is so much so here?

21:01.460 --> 21:04.191
And if you see the photographs, it is all Ganesha’s things.

21:04.391 --> 21:07.309
Absolutely the same colour, everything – just imagine.

21:07.510 --> 21:09.780
I told them a long time back when he met Me first,

21:09.980 --> 21:12.273
that your country is the country of Mooladhara.

21:12.473 --> 21:14.776
And then he sent Me this photograph from there.

21:14.976 --> 21:18.138
And I saw and I was amazed – even
the trunk is there. Can you imagine?

21:18.338 --> 21:20.175
And the whole colour, everything is the same.

21:20.375 --> 21:23.044
You have such a blessing of God; why should you worry?

21:24.760 --> 21:26.900
Your land is very holy.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.620
Is a holy land. Is written about this land.

21:29.820 --> 21:33.220
In the ancient books of India, where a

21:33.898 --> 21:37.061
saint was, had done something wrong.

21:37.261 --> 21:38.959
So God cursed him.

21:39.160 --> 21:42.660
And said, “You will go”, is called
Trishanku – your Southern Cross.

21:42.860 --> 21:46.540
That you will go to a land and create a heaven there for yourself.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.700
See, first, he was cursed to go

21:49.440 --> 21:51.099
in the Southern Hemisphere.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.660
And then it was told that you will create your own heaven.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.390
That is what it is.

21:56.740 --> 21:59.180
Warren: They may have not heard of the word Southern Cross, Mother.

21:59.381 --> 22:00.940
Shri Mataji: Southern Cross.

22:01.140 --> 22:03.820
You know the Southern Cross. It is called as Trishanku.

22:04.020 --> 22:06.807
It was hanging down, made hanging upside down.

22:07.007 --> 22:09.340
And the curse was, a little bit what you call

22:09.540 --> 22:11.260
concession given we can say.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.418
As a concession to him that,

22:13.618 --> 22:16.849
“No because you are a saint, you will create your own heaven”.

22:17.189 --> 22:20.095
That’s what it is, Australia.

22:21.860 --> 22:23.808
“Aus” itself is,

22:24.070 --> 22:25.900
“Terra” means the land and “aus” means

22:26.100 --> 22:28.050
“antariksha” – antariskha means what?

22:28.251 --> 22:31.319
Warren: There is a lady, blind
lady up there who is asking questions.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.787
Shri Mataji: What is she saying?

22:37.983 --> 22:39.483
Warren: No.

22:45.396 --> 22:48.380
Warren: A Christian scientist, practitioner told her once

22:48.580 --> 22:52.109
there is no such thing as birth. Is that correct?

22:52.600 --> 22:55.620
Shri Mataji: Do you believe him?
What good has he done to the world?

22:55.820 --> 22:57.994
They can say anything. You must ask,

22:58.194 --> 23:00.421
“What good have they done?”. All right.

23:00.622 --> 23:03.459
What is the criteria, see, of a saint? You must find.

23:03.660 --> 23:05.769
Everybody can talk about God. Who is going to check them?

23:05.970 --> 23:09.260
Even Hitler talked on God, even Napoleon talked, I don’t know.

23:09.460 --> 23:13.140
See, you must understand if they have
any right to talk? Are they saintly people?

23:13.340 --> 23:16.537
All these Christian scientists, do you think they are saintly people?

23:16.738 --> 23:19.084
Have they done any saintly work?

23:20.155 --> 23:21.999
Warren: He does healing work.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.660
Shri Mataji: You see, you can also heal with spirits. With dead spirits.

23:25.860 --> 23:29.003
That’s one thing you can do. Horrible. Keep away from them.

23:33.675 --> 23:36.309
She doesn’t know what she is talking about.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.339
Warren: Any other question?

23:41.641 --> 23:44.767
Shri Mataji: You see, anybody can say anything. I am not here answerable to them.

23:44.967 --> 23:47.750
There can be a lot of mad people,

23:47.951 --> 23:51.499
funny people, people who are anti-God, any sort but

23:51.700 --> 23:54.740
what I am talking is talking for myself. All right?

23:58.713 --> 24:00.216
What is she saying?

24:00.417 --> 24:02.470
Warren: She brought some sugar
and she would like Your vibrations in it.

24:02.671 --> 24:05.992
Shri Mataji: All right. I will give you but what about your eyes?

24:09.067 --> 24:11.167
Warren: She’s got very poor vision.

24:11.484 --> 24:15.198
Shri Mataji: All right. Now for that,
we have to work out for you, all right?

24:15.398 --> 24:18.445
We will tell you what is to be done. Have you got somebody to be with you?

24:18.645 --> 24:21.430
Have you got someone with you, who lives with you? Warren: Okay we could show them.

24:21.631 --> 24:25.002
Shri Mataji: All right. We can tell you what is to be done. That can be cured. All right?

24:25.202 --> 24:28.580
That thing can be done. So you have to come back again.

24:28.780 --> 24:31.990
And they will tell you precisely what is to be done.

24:32.190 --> 24:34.300
So work it out. You can get back your vision.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.898
All of you who have got poor vision

24:37.098 --> 24:40.271
also must know what is to be done about it. What is it?

24:41.626 --> 24:43.892
Seeker: Can we hear something about hearing?

24:44.104 --> 24:47.040
Shri Mataji: Healing? Yes, yes, hearing can also be done.

24:47.241 --> 24:48.860
Seeker: Migraine? Warren: Migraine, headaches.

24:49.061 --> 24:52.515
Shri Mataji: Of course, migraine,
can be worked out very easily, no doubt.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.535
Yes, of course, migraine is very simple.

24:55.629 --> 24:57.325
Seeker: High blood pressure.

24:58.005 --> 24:59.553
Shri Mataji: Of course. He is another;

24:59.753 --> 25:01.855
he had high blood pressure.

25:05.786 --> 25:08.786
Warren: She was born partially
deaf; that may be a little more difficult.

25:08.958 --> 25:10.336
Seeker: Yes, she's three years.

25:10.537 --> 25:14.056
Shri Mataji: It is all right – still we
will work it out. You see it is, what I am saying,

25:14.256 --> 25:16.140
you don’t have to pay for it,

25:16.340 --> 25:19.259
you don’t have to do anything – if it works out, well and good.

25:19.459 --> 25:20.909
You should try.

25:21.110 --> 25:23.550
You should try everything, all right, but…

25:24.598 --> 25:26.100
Warren: She brought her with her.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.980
Shri Mataji: Good. Where is she?

25:28.180 --> 25:31.098
Seeker: In the car. I will go and get her? Shri Mataji: All right.

25:31.298 --> 25:35.860
We will see. Little later, little later, all right. Let’s finish the whole thing.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.700
What else?

25:37.955 --> 25:39.540
Seeker: Falling of the hair.

25:39.740 --> 25:43.164
Shri Mataji: What’s she…. Warren: Falling hair. Shri Mataji: You have?

25:46.120 --> 25:48.040
Warren: Alopecia.

25:48.740 --> 25:52.661
Shri Mataji: You have the kind where you lose part, part of…

25:52.862 --> 25:56.560
Warren: Yes, clumps of hair goes.
Shri Mataji: That we have got cured now of somebody.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.375
He's much better.

26:04.259 --> 26:06.340
Shri Mataji: Who is it? Warren: What’s the question?

26:06.540 --> 26:08.490
Seeker: Supposing you get realisation

26:08.690 --> 26:10.698
and wake up the Kundalini -

26:10.898 --> 26:12.442
Warren: How would you get it?

26:12.643 --> 26:14.271
Shri Mataji: We will work it out.

26:14.472 --> 26:15.958
You come for the first time.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.955
All right we will work it out.

26:18.179 --> 26:20.471
Warren: How will we get Kundalini awakening, he is saying.

26:20.644 --> 26:22.220
Shri Mataji: We will work it out.

26:22.747 --> 26:26.235
His Agyna is too much. What, are you Christian or…?

26:27.742 --> 26:29.280
Your,

26:30.053 --> 26:32.860
centre of Christ is catching so badly.

26:33.208 --> 26:35.398
Just imagine. We will work it out. All right?

26:35.598 --> 26:37.319
Doesn’t matter.

26:39.700 --> 26:43.540
What Christ has said, “Humble down yourself in your heart”.

26:43.860 --> 26:46.580
First of all, humble down yourself in your heart.

26:46.780 --> 26:49.220
Then it works out. Humble down.

26:50.904 --> 26:52.604
All right?

26:52.920 --> 26:55.980
Agyna. This centre is very important.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.700
It works out better, you see.

27:01.866 --> 27:04.060
Don’t take up responsibility upon yourself.

27:04.260 --> 27:07.562
God is doing everything for you. Don’t worry.

27:09.623 --> 27:12.420
Seeker: Earlier on, we heard that,

27:13.020 --> 27:16.380
there is good and there is bad.

27:16.919 --> 27:19.780
But if God is in all people. Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

27:19.980 --> 27:22.736
Seeker: But then if you say
something is bad, you say God is bad?

27:22.937 --> 27:24.740
Warren: Earlier on, he heard that

27:25.840 --> 27:28.140
there a Good and bad people.

27:28.340 --> 27:31.029
But if God is Good

27:31.230 --> 27:35.213
how is it that we can reach such a conclusion?

27:35.890 --> 27:37.614
Shri Mataji: You see, you should not

27:37.814 --> 27:40.700
decide mentally who is good and who is bad, all right.

27:40.900 --> 27:43.029
And you should not give up anyone as such;

27:43.230 --> 27:45.454
as an absolutely wretched person.

27:45.655 --> 27:48.340
But on vibrations you realise

27:48.915 --> 27:50.500
that you can help

27:50.700 --> 27:53.660
quite a lot of people. Some of them you have to give up.

27:53.860 --> 27:57.360
But you just can’t help it, you just can’t help it. You can try.

27:57.412 --> 27:59.422
Like people are getting drowned, all right?.

27:59.623 --> 28:01.780
They are overloaded with things.

28:02.450 --> 28:05.682
You can bring, in the West about,

28:06.214 --> 28:09.276
I would say about forty per cent people.

28:09.477 --> 28:11.067
easily up

28:11.267 --> 28:13.106
and twenty more with little

28:13.306 --> 28:15.615
effort or quite a great effort.

28:15.816 --> 28:18.860
And ten more with really

28:19.060 --> 28:22.060
very great struggle with them.

28:22.260 --> 28:25.740
But such an ego-oriented society; it is difficult to reach them.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.285
Because the ego covers them completely.

28:29.393 --> 28:31.808
But never discard anyone; just try.

28:32.008 --> 28:35.100
But don’t try very difficult words just now, you know.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.120
Try simple words. When we want to first learn a new language,

28:38.320 --> 28:40.100
we try simple words, you see.

28:40.300 --> 28:43.392
In the same way, first, try simple people.

28:43.620 --> 28:46.198
But don’t discard anyone,

28:46.398 --> 28:47.812
but postpone.

28:48.013 --> 28:50.007
Till you become a master.

28:50.207 --> 28:53.220
Then you can try the most difficult ones also.

28:53.420 --> 28:56.780
But just now don’t think of the
most difficult. Normally what happens,

28:56.980 --> 29:00.060
people stick on to someone very difficult, like an ego challenge.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.380
“I must transform” – and then you go wrong.

29:02.580 --> 29:04.650
You don’t have to transform anyone, God has to do it.

29:04.850 --> 29:07.900
But as you are a beginner, try with simple people.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.340
All right?

29:18.485 --> 29:22.256
Warren: You spoke about Ayers
Rock. What was it you were saying?

29:23.850 --> 29:26.692
Shri Mataji: Ayers Rock is the

29:27.815 --> 29:29.497
first centre.

29:29.698 --> 29:32.580
Which shows. The deity of the first centre.

29:32.780 --> 29:34.360
It’s very vibrated.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.220
You get tremendous vibrations from it.

29:37.904 --> 29:40.500
And the whole story about it they will let you later on.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.908
Because, actually I told him that

29:43.109 --> 29:46.060
the centre is, the first centre is –
and then they sent Me the photograph

29:46.260 --> 29:49.220
of the Ayers Rock. It is true. It has vibrations.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.633
Such a great thing that has come out of the Mother Earth.

29:51.834 --> 29:53.596
Seeker: What vibrations? Will it vibrate?

29:53.797 --> 29:55.475
Shri Mataji: Yes, Holy vibrations.

29:55.676 --> 29:57.424
Seeker: Evil? Shri Mataji: Good.

29:57.598 --> 29:59.855
Seeker: Holy vibrations? Shri Mataji: Holy vibrations.

30:00.056 --> 30:01.576
Seeker: Ayers Rock?

30:04.081 --> 30:06.045
Warren: From primordial times. From way back.

30:06.246 --> 30:07.671
Shri Mataji: It has come from Mother Earth.

30:07.871 --> 30:10.330
Which is told in the Bible.

30:10.530 --> 30:14.420
That you shall now worship anything that is created by Mother Earth.

30:14.620 --> 30:16.860
Now, what is created by Mother Earth?

30:17.131 --> 30:19.801
We should not reproduce and worship.

30:20.002 --> 30:22.558
But whatever is created by Mother Earth. And this is one of them.

30:22.758 --> 30:24.773
You have got such a great thing here.

30:25.685 --> 30:27.786
It is tremendous. When you become aware of it,

30:27.986 --> 30:30.443
you will be amazed. It just emits vibrations all over.

30:30.643 --> 30:34.180
But people who are evil, who are following black magic,

30:34.380 --> 30:36.820
wrong practices – may call it an evil one.

30:37.020 --> 30:39.740
Because for them, you see, it is evil, isn’t it?

30:39.940 --> 30:43.447
Because that destroys all black magic and all that.

30:46.965 --> 30:49.740
Seeker: Something’s gone wrong with my Kundalini.

30:49.940 --> 30:53.638
It has been burning at the bottom of my spine for years.

30:54.337 --> 30:56.060
Shri Mataji: When was this?

30:57.353 --> 30:59.185
How many years back?

30:59.386 --> 31:01.853
Seeker: Must have been four years.

31:02.201 --> 31:04.869
Warren: Did you go to anybody? Shri Mataji: Did you go to anyone?

31:05.070 --> 31:06.980
Seeker: Yeah, Maharishi. Warren: Maharishi.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.580
Shri Mataji: That’s a difficult fellow. But I will work it out.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.740
Sit down on Mother Earth.

31:14.644 --> 31:16.550
Maharishi is one person; is horrid.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.967
Warren: Take your shoes off. Shri Mataji: Take it out.

31:24.745 --> 31:26.825
Warren: This is a good example.

31:30.285 --> 31:32.980
Shri Mataji: But despite all this you see, nobody has made

31:33.180 --> 31:35.300
a very joint effort.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.780
Why don’t you write to our government or someone?

31:37.980 --> 31:39.578
You see, it can be done.

31:39.778 --> 31:42.660
Actually, when I talk to the government people because

31:42.876 --> 31:45.558
I am quite highly connected. My brother himself is a minister.

31:45.758 --> 31:48.660
I know the President and everyone there.

31:48.861 --> 31:51.908
What they said is that is it You only who says these things.

31:52.109 --> 31:55.220
I openly say. But nobody says anything you see;

31:55.420 --> 31:58.020
nobody has anything written against it.

31:59.325 --> 32:01.570
So if you people write from here,

32:01.770 --> 32:04.530
join together that they have taken so much money from us,

32:04.730 --> 32:07.300
they have ruined us, they have done this and that, isn’t it?

32:07.500 --> 32:09.607
Then it will be better.

32:10.020 --> 32:13.460
Because they think that you are all very much satisfied with them.

32:14.418 --> 32:16.114
And it so happens that in the beginning,

32:16.314 --> 32:18.540
some people come, they get ruined; the others come.

32:18.740 --> 32:21.660
It’s like a moving train, you see, that takes passengers ahead.

32:21.860 --> 32:23.786
And the passengers who have suffered are

32:23.986 --> 32:26.568
left behind without any combined effort.

32:26.769 --> 32:29.420
But in Paris, they have started a thing like that now.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.500
Which is a very good thing.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.381
Which is trying to oppose this.

32:34.581 --> 32:36.420
But unless and until you write something,

32:36.620 --> 32:38.900
I don’t know how to take up with the government.

32:45.116 --> 32:46.671
What’s it?

32:48.186 --> 32:50.460
This one is talking too much.

32:55.581 --> 32:58.300
Warren: Look, you have asked quite a few questions.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.924
I'll give this one to Mother and we will make it the last.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.220
Warren: Doctor McDonald Baynes who was

33:03.420 --> 33:05.199
a writer who lived in the Himalayas,

33:05.399 --> 33:08.180
about the spiritual development said there is a celestial city

33:08.380 --> 33:10.634
over the Dandenong ranges which is

33:10.835 --> 33:12.739
nearby to Melbourne here.

33:13.236 --> 33:14.744
What are your views?

33:15.659 --> 33:17.660
Shri Mataji: I haven’t seen them as yet.

33:17.860 --> 33:20.984
But must be, must be celestial here, no doubt.

33:21.184 --> 33:24.240
Is it towards the sea, the Southern side?

33:24.441 --> 33:27.118
Warren: To the…what is it, the east? To the east.

33:27.418 --> 33:29.420
Shri Mataji: I don’t know this Baynes fellow,

33:29.620 --> 33:31.660
how much to depend on him also.

33:31.860 --> 33:33.460
Warren: He’s not realised.

33:34.239 --> 33:36.585
He has good vibrations, but not realised.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.220
Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Makes no difference, you see.

33:39.420 --> 33:41.163
You have to have vibrations.

33:41.363 --> 33:43.420
What is the use of having these ranges around?

33:43.620 --> 33:45.220
You better have them.

33:51.535 --> 33:53.939
Now done, everyone?

33:55.718 --> 33:58.980
How many of you did feel the cool breeze the other day?

33:59.180 --> 34:00.700
Let's raise your hands.

34:03.024 --> 34:05.500
Warren: Put your both hands up so Mother can see.

34:09.503 --> 34:11.651
A lot of them haven’t been before.

34:11.852 --> 34:15.852
Shri Mataji: All right. If you all put your
hands, let us see how many of you feel again.

34:16.844 --> 34:19.900
Just sit down, comfortably, put your hands towards Me.

34:20.859 --> 34:24.100
You can’t sit like that. Can you get some chair for the lady?

34:24.684 --> 34:27.620
Just, there are some chairs. You get a chair.

34:27.820 --> 34:30.384
You are not supposed to sit with your feet towards Me, you see.

34:30.584 --> 34:33.300
It is not regarded as good, all right? Better take chairs.

34:34.901 --> 34:37.540
I am sorry. I know why you feel…

34:37.740 --> 34:40.856
you can put the chair here on the sides. Come along.

34:42.411 --> 34:44.660
Then you, that’s what it is. Then you can’t…

34:44.860 --> 34:46.500
hello, how are you?

34:47.966 --> 34:49.820
Put yourself like that

34:50.020 --> 34:51.175
or you can sit on the chair.

34:51.375 --> 34:53.780
Come along, it is all right. Just come here.

34:53.980 --> 34:56.703
This doesn’t matter, If you have to sit on the chair, doesn't matter

34:56.903 --> 34:58.365
it is all right.

35:02.429 --> 35:04.700
Shri Mataji: Anyway, anyway, but not towards Me, you see.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.136
You just can’t put your feet like that.

35:08.566 --> 35:12.256
That’s what it is supposed to be.
Doesn’t matter, after all, you are children.

35:12.457 --> 35:15.757
And I am the Mother. Doesn’t matter what you do.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.870
Some of them are great people over here.

35:27.404 --> 35:30.380
Now, put your hands towards Me like this.

35:37.025 --> 35:39.246
I think, better close your eyes.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.660
Can you take out this a little? I will put My feet on the ground.

35:43.289 --> 35:45.061
Mother Earth.

35:49.697 --> 35:52.937
Warren: Would you like me to pull the
chair forward? Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

36:16.697 --> 36:18.881
What’s the matter with the lady?

36:19.580 --> 36:21.620
Are you shaking too much?

36:21.983 --> 36:24.700
You been to some clairvoyant person?

36:25.915 --> 36:28.746
That’s the reason. All right. You come sit on the Mother grass,

36:28.946 --> 36:30.750
all right, would be better. Yes.

36:30.951 --> 36:32.606
Shri Mataji: Anyone shaking there?

36:32.807 --> 36:34.398
Anyone shaking in the body?

36:34.598 --> 36:38.100
Keep your eyes open and sit on the Mother
Earth. She takes away the problem, you see.

36:38.300 --> 36:41.576
If you have been to a clairvoyant or someone, you may.

36:45.510 --> 36:47.675
Shri Mataji: If you are not shaking it’s all right.

36:47.875 --> 36:50.377
Everyone doesn’t get affected but some do, you see,

36:50.577 --> 36:52.577
it’s those horrible things they do.

36:53.369 --> 36:55.460
Sit on the Mother Earth, it’s better.

36:57.088 --> 36:59.499
What’s she saying? Warren: A bit giddy.

36:59.700 --> 37:03.308
Shri Mataji: Better sit on the Mother Earth.
You have been to some clairvoyant person?

37:03.509 --> 37:05.019
No?

37:07.925 --> 37:09.660
Been to a guru?

37:11.329 --> 37:13.367
Must be having a liver.

37:13.681 --> 37:15.820
All right, come along here, let me see.

37:18.248 --> 37:21.700
She has a liver. Very bad liver you have.

37:23.315 --> 37:25.420
Did you feel giddy also before?

37:25.620 --> 37:27.420
Seeker: I just had a serious operation.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.820
Shri Mataji: What operation? Seeker: Brain surgery.

37:30.020 --> 37:31.535
Warren: Brain surgery.

37:31.736 --> 37:33.860
Shri Mataji: It's all right. Keep your eyes open all right.

37:34.060 --> 37:35.940
Don’t close them. Keep your eyes open.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.940
You had an accident?

37:40.775 --> 37:42.275
Doesn’t matter.

37:50.110 --> 37:51.620
Nabhi is too much.

37:51.820 --> 37:53.904
Keep your eyes open, please.

37:54.104 --> 37:55.780
How are you feeling now?

37:56.551 --> 37:58.096
Still giddy?

37:59.166 --> 38:01.601
Better? Would you like to lie down?

38:02.028 --> 38:04.133
We can get you a pillow. All right.

38:04.347 --> 38:07.269
Better lie down. You can let her
lie down here. You can lie down here.

38:07.470 --> 38:09.300
Warren: Come over here. Shri Mataji: Put the pillow there.

38:09.501 --> 38:12.100
Put the pillow on that side and the feet at the back, yes.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.900
Let her lie down.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.614
Warren: Put your head down here.

38:15.814 --> 38:18.060
Shri Mataji: Don’t cry. Don’t cry. You are going to be alright.

38:18.260 --> 38:20.180
You just don’t worry. Put your head here.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.707
Towards Me. Yes, just…

38:24.559 --> 38:27.860
You have to work it out. Don’t cry. You wanted to see Me, is it?

38:28.075 --> 38:29.675
Or lie this way.

38:30.303 --> 38:32.580
Parallel to, will be better.

38:34.778 --> 38:38.778
It shows, you see there's any problem, it shows, it shows.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.780
Just lie down. Be comfortable.

38:49.664 --> 38:51.930
Will work out. Don’t you worry.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.940
You are going to be all right.

39:01.180 --> 39:04.420
It’s good, fine. May God Bless You.

39:04.971 --> 39:06.660
All right?

39:10.905 --> 39:13.948
Now those who are feeling the cool breeze,

39:14.148 --> 39:15.654
already,

39:16.412 --> 39:18.820
can get up and see others,

39:19.146 --> 39:20.940
who are not feeling it.

39:21.147 --> 39:22.859
And you can stand behind one person each.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.675
I will teach you how to give them realisation also.

39:25.876 --> 39:27.435
Can be done now.

39:27.635 --> 39:30.900
All right. Those who are really feeling the cool breeze, can get up.

39:31.501 --> 39:33.700
It’s a good idea to help others. Yes. Let’s have it.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.695
Warren: Can the Sahaja Yogis do the same thing.

39:35.896 --> 39:39.340
Shri Mataji: Also the Sahaja Yogis. Those
who are feeling the cool breeze. Come along.

39:44.609 --> 39:47.444
Now, all of you should put your

39:48.008 --> 39:51.580
left hand towards Me and right hand on top of the head of the person.

39:52.094 --> 39:54.041
Left hand towards me, yes.

39:54.241 --> 39:56.580
On top, not touching, not touching.

39:56.780 --> 39:58.460
Higher. Like this, yes.

40:02.870 --> 40:05.009
See. It works better.

40:05.712 --> 40:08.100
You act as a sort of  a

40:08.300 --> 40:10.740
wire, thing.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.965
It passes. See, now, ha, better?

40:13.165 --> 40:14.860
All right.

40:16.529 --> 40:18.540
What about you? You feeling it?

40:18.740 --> 40:22.060
Now get up. You can get up. Those who are feeling can get up.

40:22.557 --> 40:24.420
Now, are you better now?

40:24.620 --> 40:26.125
Not yet.

40:27.287 --> 40:30.540
You put your right hand out like that, yourself.

40:30.849 --> 40:33.367
The Indian gentleman put your right hand.

40:33.567 --> 40:36.860
Like this, at the back, yes. And put left towards Me.

40:39.434 --> 40:41.500
All right? Good.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.220
You getting it?

40:43.686 --> 40:46.299
Are you? No, not yet.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.427
All right. It will work out. Just don’t you worry.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.894
Maybe some of you can put your left hand and see

40:54.094 --> 40:56.700
with the right hand like this. It will work out.

40:57.198 --> 41:00.020
Left towards Me and right hand out.

41:01.276 --> 41:04.300
No, no, left towards Me like this, left like this

41:04.500 --> 41:06.145
and the right like that.

41:06.346 --> 41:08.220
Just try, some of you.

41:08.874 --> 41:11.301
If it works out better. Or the other way round.

41:11.502 --> 41:13.694
She’s got it. You feeling it?

41:14.036 --> 41:17.780
Good. She’s got it. Now work on ….you feeling now?

41:17.980 --> 41:19.493
Good, good.

41:20.899 --> 41:23.980
It’s good. Put it like that

41:24.180 --> 41:25.700
and this one like that.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.420
You can put it towards Me. The right hand if you want.

41:28.620 --> 41:31.580
Right towards Me. One hand has to be towards Me.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.828
Put one hand towards Me, like that. That’s it.

41:34.028 --> 41:35.540
Now, tell her also.

41:35.740 --> 41:37.540
Put the other hand,

41:37.740 --> 41:40.478
the way she is doing. No. Yes, good.

41:40.679 --> 41:42.380
Good.

41:42.761 --> 41:45.500
Are you feeling? No.

41:46.787 --> 41:50.140
Sit on the Mother Earth. Move on the Mother Earth more.

42:03.124 --> 42:04.749
Now try another lady.

42:04.958 --> 42:07.428
Yes, yes, you go on trying. She’s very good.

42:07.745 --> 42:10.605
She doing very well, yeah. Just put one hand

42:10.805 --> 42:12.759
towards Me, that's all. Simple. Is it?

42:12.960 --> 42:15.900
Seeker: Hot vibration. Shri Mataji: But not cool.

42:16.140 --> 42:18.433
Not cool as yet. Seeker: Not much though.

42:18.633 --> 42:20.940
Shri Mataji: It will, it will work out. What about you?

42:21.140 --> 42:23.460
Not yet? Try on her. Maybe.

42:24.051 --> 42:26.051
Seeker: Very hot, Mother.

42:27.171 --> 42:28.788
Shri Mataji: You are feeling hot?

42:28.989 --> 42:30.834
On her?

42:31.066 --> 42:33.020
What’s the problem?

42:33.735 --> 42:35.804
You think too much, do you?

42:35.999 --> 42:38.287
Seeker: I don't know what I supposed to be feeling?

42:38.561 --> 42:40.900
Shri Mataji: You feel the cool breeze on the hand do you?

42:41.490 --> 42:44.263
No, no. No, no. That’s a different thing. You feel a

42:44.463 --> 42:47.090
sensation in your hand. No?

42:55.662 --> 42:57.165
All right?

42:58.352 --> 42:59.940
She’s good.

43:00.258 --> 43:02.010
It’s rising, it’s rising.

43:02.210 --> 43:03.797
She’s got it.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.380
You got it, no. Not feeling it?

43:06.580 --> 43:09.340
Can you take out that necklace a little bit?

43:09.540 --> 43:12.269
These things a little bit, sometimes that also affects.

43:12.470 --> 43:14.027
Are you better, My child?

43:14.227 --> 43:16.862
Better now? Good. Good.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.380
Put your left hand up that way.

43:26.078 --> 43:28.491
All right? It will work out.

43:34.462 --> 43:36.180
Is she better?

43:36.380 --> 43:38.763
Little bit. She's improving. Put your hand like this.

43:38.964 --> 43:41.899
Have patience with yourself. You
must have some patience with yourself.

43:42.099 --> 43:43.613
That’s the main point is.

43:45.855 --> 43:48.143
Better now? It's Better?

43:48.344 --> 43:50.980
Yes, it is. Working out?

43:51.242 --> 43:52.762
Better.

43:59.774 --> 44:01.580
Keep your eyes open.

44:02.748 --> 44:04.992
Tell her to keep her eyes open.

44:05.192 --> 44:07.580
All right? Better?

44:12.506 --> 44:14.111
No?

44:14.633 --> 44:17.049
Her Vishuddhi is not all…yes?

44:18.482 --> 44:19.982
Very hot?

44:20.358 --> 44:23.100
All right. She has been to some guru?

44:23.510 --> 44:25.020
No one.

44:26.673 --> 44:28.700
To no clairvoyant or anyone?

44:28.900 --> 44:30.479
Not at all?

44:36.987 --> 44:40.699
Put your left hand on the right-hand side of your stomach.

44:45.554 --> 44:47.300
Is it all right?

44:48.563 --> 44:51.060
Put your left hand

44:51.260 --> 44:52.740
on the Mother Earth.

44:53.119 --> 44:56.393
Like that, yes. And right hand towards Me.

44:58.448 --> 44:59.948
Like this.

45:12.253 --> 45:14.188
Did you feel the cool breeze? Good.

45:14.388 --> 45:16.100
Why not work on these two gentlemen?

45:16.300 --> 45:18.100
This gentleman and this lady?

45:18.300 --> 45:21.660
Did you feel? No? All right, you get up and work on them.

45:21.860 --> 45:24.986
Not on your relations or friends all right? Other people.

45:25.186 --> 45:27.980
That’s important. In the beginning.

45:29.117 --> 45:30.762
It’s better now?

45:30.962 --> 45:32.767
No? No?

45:33.590 --> 45:36.340
He is a very difficult, horrible person I tell you.

45:36.540 --> 45:39.600
One of the worst you can think of this Mahesh Yogi.

45:39.801 --> 45:42.223
And how much money has amassed do you know?

45:46.485 --> 45:49.860
We have someone there from him. The whole family is ruined.

45:50.060 --> 45:51.642
It's Terrible.

45:58.383 --> 45:59.888
Is it?

46:07.157 --> 46:08.893
Comes and goes. All right. Don’t think.

46:09.093 --> 46:10.660
Just watch Me without thinking.

46:10.860 --> 46:12.500
If it comes. Are you better?

46:19.505 --> 46:22.151
She has an Agyna, I think. This lady.

46:22.352 --> 46:23.740
What about you?

46:23.940 --> 46:26.340
Did you feel? Good.

46:28.974 --> 46:32.819
He has to put his left hand on his stomach. Liver, you see.

46:33.192 --> 46:36.187
Liver and Vishuddhi both the Center.

46:39.551 --> 46:41.974
He is difficult. He is very difficult.

46:42.174 --> 46:46.067
You sit on Mother Earth. Let him sit.
He is difficult. He’s from that horrible

46:46.268 --> 46:48.390
Satya Sai Baba. He’s the worst.

46:48.590 --> 46:50.860
Till you get a heart attack he won’t leave you.

46:55.264 --> 46:58.356
Put your right hand on Mother Earth and left hand towards Me.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.100
Is she better?

47:15.017 --> 47:17.288
Little hot is she?

47:17.605 --> 47:19.249
She has a liver too.

47:21.378 --> 47:23.900
Hello? You put your left hand

47:24.131 --> 47:26.260
on your stomach on the right side.

47:26.460 --> 47:27.945
Right side.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.643
Right side, yes.

47:29.737 --> 47:31.920
Who is the gentleman with migraine?

47:32.356 --> 47:34.292
You have got migraine?

47:34.488 --> 47:36.073
Seeker: No, my wife has.

47:36.273 --> 47:37.944
My wife has it, I have nothing!

47:38.145 --> 47:40.780
Shri Mataji: All right. You watch at Me. Watch this side.

47:40.980 --> 47:42.958
You see, don’t watch other people.

47:47.236 --> 47:48.736
She?

47:49.010 --> 47:51.566
She’s all right, she's coming. She a liver, it's true.

47:51.767 --> 47:53.948
So many have livers, livers – I don’t know why.

47:54.149 --> 47:56.380
What about this lady? Did she feel any?

47:56.580 --> 47:58.660
Good, good. But keep your hands, have more.

47:58.860 --> 48:02.012
You see, I am here for a short time. I'll go away.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.780
Now don’t put your shoes towards Me, all right.

48:04.980 --> 48:06.867
If you can take out, thank you.

48:08.206 --> 48:11.206
Is she crying? Put her right to the left.

48:14.113 --> 48:16.247
You are all right. She’s got it.

48:17.959 --> 48:20.398
I can see from your eyes. Good.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.820
You are doing a good job.

48:23.020 --> 48:24.375
Seeker: Mother, can I ask you,

48:24.575 --> 48:26.873
I know I shouldn't be asking you questions

48:27.468 --> 48:30.187
but I've been ill for twelve years with

48:30.387 --> 48:31.860
kidneys and...

48:32.374 --> 48:34.218
Shri Mataji: Now no more. It’s finished.

48:34.418 --> 48:36.381
It is done, it's done.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.740
Got some water for Me?

48:38.940 --> 48:40.804
Seeker: You saw me at a lecture.

48:41.004 --> 48:42.426
Shri Mataji: Did you bring water?

48:42.626 --> 48:44.980
Seeker: No, I have been drinking the water you gave me.

48:45.411 --> 48:47.140
Shri Mataji: Good. You are all right.

48:47.340 --> 48:49.924
No kidneys, nothing. Finished.

48:50.124 --> 48:53.898
Did you go on the machine anytime with the kidney?

48:54.098 --> 48:57.090
Seeker: What machine?
Shri Mataji: That they do circulation of the -

48:57.290 --> 48:57.966
Seeker: No.

48:58.166 --> 49:00.408
Shri Mataji: Thank God. Then its all right, no problem.

49:00.608 --> 49:03.500
What about this gentleman here? Did you feel?

49:04.701 --> 49:06.420
Hot? Hot?

49:09.870 --> 49:13.420
You put your left hand on your stomach, on the right-hand side.

49:14.418 --> 49:15.992
Can you?

49:16.921 --> 49:18.296
What is it?

49:19.099 --> 49:21.069
Can you try this gentleman here?

49:21.269 --> 49:22.903
He will be all right.

49:23.103 --> 49:24.779
Keep your eyes open.

49:24.979 --> 49:26.468
This lady.

49:27.550 --> 49:30.665
Ask her also to open her eyes.

49:33.327 --> 49:35.089
Very pale.

49:35.297 --> 49:36.815
What about you?

49:39.010 --> 49:40.573
Left hand?

49:41.844 --> 49:43.346
Not right hand?

49:46.200 --> 49:50.000
You also put your left hand on
the stomach, on the right-hand side.

49:52.976 --> 49:54.742
Good. It will work out.

49:54.942 --> 49:57.120
It will slowly work out in everyone.

49:58.562 --> 50:00.118
Good.

50:02.124 --> 50:05.129
You still have? All right. Come along here.

50:07.117 --> 50:08.810
Can you sit facing that side?

50:09.010 --> 50:10.700
I have to put My foot if you don’t mind.

50:10.900 --> 50:12.595
Seeker: On the back? Lovely.

50:12.796 --> 50:15.146
Shri Mataji: Just sit comfortability.

50:15.732 --> 50:18.540
No, I think it’s here.

50:22.109 --> 50:24.843
There are certain exercises you have to do for this.

50:25.043 --> 50:27.492
But in any case, I will cure you now.

50:27.813 --> 50:29.500
This will dissolve out.

50:34.714 --> 50:37.346
How are these people? Are you all right? Good.

50:37.547 --> 50:39.510
I am happy you are working it.

50:39.710 --> 50:41.748
From Mauritius, yes, good.

50:41.948 --> 50:43.820
Good, good, I'm happy.

50:45.154 --> 50:46.940
They are not getting it?

50:54.564 --> 50:56.686
They will, they will. All of them have to get it.

50:56.886 --> 50:58.903
They will get it, don’t you worry.

51:00.095 --> 51:01.995
It's better now?

51:04.153 --> 51:06.940
Some ossification has taken place.

51:07.546 --> 51:09.340
What were you doing?

51:09.541 --> 51:12.540
Seeker: Hatha yoga. Shri Mataji: Hatha yoga!

51:14.122 --> 51:16.136
That’s it, without your...

51:16.336 --> 51:18.460
I was wondering how it’s gone into that.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.028
Seeker: Yeah, it is difficult.

51:20.228 --> 51:22.378
Shri Mataji: It is horrible. Stop all Hatha yoga.

51:22.579 --> 51:26.202
No, no, no, no. I will tell you what exercises are to be done.

51:26.403 --> 51:29.100
For everyone, not the same exercise

51:29.300 --> 51:32.328
– for everyone there is a different exercise, all right.

51:35.391 --> 51:37.180
Good. Enjoy.

51:46.232 --> 51:47.740
Is he all right?

51:51.222 --> 51:53.540
He’s been to some guru or someone?

51:54.843 --> 51:57.436
No, not you. Him. Have you been?

52:01.955 --> 52:03.623
Seeker: Don't believe in gurus.

52:03.824 --> 52:05.820
No? Thank God.

52:06.654 --> 52:08.140
Shri Mataji: But...

52:08.340 --> 52:10.340
Seeker: I practice meditation.

52:10.541 --> 52:11.777
Shri Mataji: Your own?

52:11.977 --> 52:14.020
Seeker: No not my own, it's

52:14.220 --> 52:15.677
Buddhist meditation.

52:15.880 --> 52:18.295
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s just the same.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.740
Just the same, all right?

52:24.480 --> 52:27.602
Ask him to put his right hand
towards Me and left hand on his stomach.

52:27.803 --> 52:30.525
And say, “Mother, make me my own guru”.

52:33.581 --> 52:36.717
Better now, madam? All right?

52:37.082 --> 52:40.154
Seeker: There is blue light in the Agyna centre.

52:41.949 --> 52:44.856
Shri Mataji: No, that should not be so. It should go away.

52:45.057 --> 52:47.314
All must go away. It’s a horrible thing.

52:49.559 --> 52:51.191
You ought to be.

52:51.391 --> 52:54.740
You are to become the light.
The light does not see the light, does it?

52:55.605 --> 52:58.275
You have to become. Not see something.

52:58.475 --> 53:01.469
If you see the sky, you don’t become the sky, do you?

53:02.360 --> 53:05.660
But when you are the sky, you don’t see the sky.

53:07.166 --> 53:09.787
All right? Now better?

53:13.407 --> 53:15.249
What about you? Didn’t feel it?

53:15.449 --> 53:17.178
Don’t be upset about it. Nothing to be

53:17.378 --> 53:19.363
– you have a liver problem, do you know that.

53:19.563 --> 53:22.060
That’s all. It’s very simple. Now do one thing.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.140
You put your right hand towards Me

53:24.340 --> 53:26.218
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

53:26.419 --> 53:28.488
Just on the backside.

53:28.870 --> 53:31.297
No, that side. Behind your hand.

53:32.719 --> 53:35.375
Yes. It will work out. Now don’t get upset.

53:36.211 --> 53:39.620
Nobody should be upset. Now those who are not feeling anything,

53:39.820 --> 53:41.660
please raise your hand. Let’s see.

53:42.970 --> 53:45.370
Keep your hands raised, all right?

53:50.898 --> 53:53.542
You put both your hands and say, “Mother, is this the

53:53.743 --> 53:56.753
power of God? Is this the power of Brahma?.

53:56.954 --> 53:59.018
Is this the Brahmashakti?”.

54:13.805 --> 54:15.820
Are you feeling, some of you?

54:21.232 --> 54:22.820
Don’t doubt it, you see.

54:23.020 --> 54:25.900
It’s a kind of feeling you get in your fingers.

54:26.357 --> 54:28.514
Raise them higher. Let’s see.

54:33.136 --> 54:34.768
You are all right.

54:38.130 --> 54:40.460
Higher, on your heads.

54:45.033 --> 54:46.612
It’s there.

54:52.336 --> 54:54.300
Now, are you feeling it now?

54:54.944 --> 54:56.940
It’s there. Good.

55:00.102 --> 55:03.631
Are you feeling? Seeker: Tingling. Tingling.

55:03.861 --> 55:06.512
Shri Mataji: Tingling? Tingling has to go away a little bit.

55:06.729 --> 55:10.100
You can put both your hands on the
Mother Earth. Now let’s see. On the Mother Earth.

55:10.300 --> 55:12.615
For a while. There’s tingling.

55:42.619 --> 55:45.820
Now just see. Tingling has gone? Raise your hands and see.

55:46.121 --> 55:48.263
Tingling is gone.

55:54.841 --> 55:56.341
Better?

56:34.901 --> 56:36.583
It’s better now.

56:37.542 --> 56:39.894
All right, now bring it down, see.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.911
Let her sit on the Mother Earth. Is she sitting on the Mother Earth?

56:56.112 --> 56:59.540
Let her put her left hand... left hand on the Mother Earth.

56:59.740 --> 57:01.564
Is she been to some guru?

57:01.765 --> 57:03.395
Warren: It’s a man.

57:04.199 --> 57:06.197
He’s getting hotter and hotter.

57:06.397 --> 57:08.160
Have you been to a guru?

57:08.550 --> 57:10.135
Shri Mataji: Rajneesh?

57:11.447 --> 57:13.250
Warren: Has he been to a guru?

57:15.927 --> 57:17.939
An Indian fellow or…?

57:18.795 --> 57:20.420
Muktananda.

57:38.064 --> 57:41.238
Shri Mataji: Put your left hand towards
Me and right hand on the Mother Earth.

57:44.289 --> 57:47.820
You have to work hard I must tell you, this Muktananda.

57:50.896 --> 57:53.287
Warren: He had only one visit to the centre, it wasn't by

57:53.487 --> 57:56.660
-Was it by him, himself or by the people?

57:57.922 --> 57:59.454
Was it the guru himself?

57:59.663 --> 58:02.820
Shri Mataji: He also is left
Swadishthana is so catching, how can that be?

58:03.020 --> 58:04.974
Warren: Yes, they were affected by him.

58:05.174 --> 58:07.300
Shri Mataji: Very bad left Swadishthana.

58:07.500 --> 58:10.180
Better now? Are they cooler?

58:11.225 --> 58:14.225
Good, good, it’s working out, all right.

58:32.240 --> 58:34.259
Warren: Even if you go to meetings where

58:34.459 --> 58:36.367
you don’t get initiated but

58:36.567 --> 58:38.512
mixing with these people, do you get affected?

58:38.713 --> 58:42.300
Shri Mataji: Of course. You see, to get dirty is easy, isn’t it?

58:42.507 --> 58:44.820
But to get holy is difficult.

58:45.578 --> 58:48.860
Seeker: I've been hot and my hands radiant heat

58:49.061 --> 58:51.045
and my body has gotten very, very hot.

58:51.245 --> 58:53.522
Shri Mataji: Why don’t you sit on the Mother Earth?

58:54.278 --> 58:55.869
She will clear out.

58:56.852 --> 58:58.993
Shri Mataji: Which meetings you have been to?

59:01.449 --> 59:03.029
Warren: She visits any.

59:05.503 --> 59:09.380
Shri Mataji: Let the Mother Earth help you.
All right, come along on the Mother Earth. Please.

59:09.580 --> 59:12.538
All right? She will help you. That’s a very good thing.

59:12.739 --> 59:15.620
Mother Earth, those who are sitting are better helped, here.

59:15.882 --> 59:17.614
It’s all for that.

59:19.543 --> 59:22.155
Warren: Anyone who’s not feeling should move on the earth.

59:22.356 --> 59:25.263
Shri Mataji: She helps. Definitely helps, definitely helps.

59:25.464 --> 59:27.270
If you are even sitting on this

59:27.506 --> 59:30.140
impervious material, whatever it is.

59:31.722 --> 59:33.940
something artificial in those,

59:34.140 --> 59:36.515
things stuck inside those.

59:40.056 --> 59:42.190
Warren: And slip your shoes off too.

59:46.220 --> 59:48.847
Shri Mataji: It’s very pleasant today, isn’t it?

59:53.535 --> 59:57.464
How is he? Keep his eyes open. All this thing just see this.

59:57.782 --> 01:00:00.685
He’s got all this, Hamsa. Keep your eyes open.

01:00:00.886 --> 01:00:04.125
Warren: He’s been to Muktananda and
he’s got it. But he can’t feel it, unfortunately.

01:00:04.326 --> 01:00:08.094
Shri Mataji: Hamsa, you see. Hamsa
is there. Hamsa and Vishuddhi both.

01:00:10.279 --> 01:00:12.140
You get it, sinus?

01:00:14.222 --> 01:00:15.904
So only Hamsa.

01:00:16.339 --> 01:00:20.140
All people who have been to gurus put your left
hand towards Me and right hand on Mother Earth.

01:00:20.341 --> 01:00:22.161
That’s the simple thing as that.

01:00:22.362 --> 01:00:24.495
Let him sit on the Mother Earth. Let him work it out.

01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:28.658
Warren: If you have been to a guru and see if it works out.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:30.359
Shri Mataji: It will improve your,

01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:33.996
always improve your sensitivity. See, better.

01:00:36.796 --> 01:00:39.743
He is a Hamsa fellow, problem with his...

01:00:39.944 --> 01:00:42.559
What are you wearing in your hand? Take it out also.

01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:45.303
Right Vishuddhi. You can take it out for a while.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.700
You sit on the Mother Earth. All right? It is better.

01:00:50.462 --> 01:00:51.997
It’s good.

01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:55.380
Warren: Anyone having problems, come up to the front here.

01:00:57.855 --> 01:01:01.026
Shri Mataji: On the Mother Earth.
Mother Earth helps you, the sun helps you,

01:01:01.227 --> 01:01:03.442
the light helps you. Everything helps you.

01:01:03.643 --> 01:01:06.334
All right let’s see. What the problem is now.

01:01:06.723 --> 01:01:10.500
Can you take out the cross for a while, for a while, just for a while?

01:01:12.365 --> 01:01:14.786
If you could. Ha!

01:01:15.726 --> 01:01:17.620
Been to a Muktanand?

01:01:19.085 --> 01:01:21.809
He’s horrible – gives such a bad Vishuddhi and

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.393
all this, Ekadasha?

01:01:25.336 --> 01:01:28.649
Keep your eyes open, My child.
Keep your eyes open. Watch Me, please.

01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:33.540
I will let you know, I'm talking to him.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.555
Right, it’s all right. Don’t you worry. We have clear it out.

01:01:38.138 --> 01:01:39.638
Are you all right?

01:01:40.524 --> 01:01:42.293
Sahaja Yogi: She doesn't feel it, Mother.

01:01:44.171 --> 01:01:45.673
She doesn't what?

01:01:45.874 --> 01:01:47.795
Warren: She has Vishuddhi catching.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:49.783
Shri Mataji: She’s been to some guru?

01:02:04.236 --> 01:02:05.736
She will be all right.

01:02:06.046 --> 01:02:07.546
She will be all right.

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:09.459
Whom do you worship?

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.241
Whom do you worship? Seeker: Ram, Shri Ram.

01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:14.694
Shri Mataji: All right. Ask her to say the mantra.

01:02:14.895 --> 01:02:17.437
Just let her put her left hand on the heart.

01:02:19.117 --> 01:02:21.048
Right heart. Right heart.

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:23.335
Just ask her, all right.

01:02:23.535 --> 01:02:25.820
It is good. It will work out in no time.

01:02:54.603 --> 01:02:56.323
Just see on her head.

01:03:09.221 --> 01:03:10.721
Good.

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:13.620
The time has come for you to recognise

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.620
and get the reward for all your bhakti, isn’t it?

01:03:17.118 --> 01:03:20.098
The time has to come. May God Bless You.

01:03:20.298 --> 01:03:22.380
Indians are very easy to handle. Ask her.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.460
Is she an Indian lady?

01:03:28.001 --> 01:03:29.700
Krishna. All right.

01:03:31.901 --> 01:03:34.100
Good. Better, this will work out.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.300
Close your eyes now. Enjoy.

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:43.671
Good.

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:47.756
All right?

01:03:50.699 --> 01:03:53.776
We have to get over all these evil forces, isn’t it?

01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:56.807
You have to. Are you all right, My child?

01:03:58.298 --> 01:03:59.870
All right?

01:04:00.406 --> 01:04:02.515
You can come here, on the Mother Earth.

01:04:02.716 --> 01:04:05.284
Anyone who needs help, come along. Come here.

01:04:05.485 --> 01:04:08.605
Warren: She is feeling it too, the
other lady. She’s from Ceylon. She’s asked,

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:10.338
“Are you Krishna?”.

01:04:10.503 --> 01:04:12.669
Shri Mataji: All right. Now keep both the hands.

01:04:12.869 --> 01:04:15.860
And you enjoy yourself. Is she, what’s your name please?

01:04:16.684 --> 01:04:18.447
She’s from Ceylon?

01:04:21.469 --> 01:04:23.100
Seeker: Prabha. Shri Mataji: Prabha?

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.353
And the surname? Seeker: Rao.

01:04:25.554 --> 01:04:27.081
Shri Mataji: Prabha Rao. All right.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:29.270
It will work out in no time.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:33.470
You put your bag on the ground
below and put both your hands towards Me.

01:04:35.364 --> 01:04:38.198
It will work out Mrs Rao, yes it's working out.

01:04:38.398 --> 01:04:41.724
Sit down. Yes. Be comfortable. Be comfortable.

01:04:44.153 --> 01:04:47.027
Better? Are you? No, same?

01:04:51.218 --> 01:04:53.486
Seeker: I seem so very tired.

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.100
Shri Mataji: It’s horrible, I tell you.

01:04:57.676 --> 01:05:00.351
We have to work it and work it out. It will work out, all right?

01:05:00.551 --> 01:05:02.580
Don’t give up. Patience. It will work out.

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:05.780
Touch your, Mother Earth. Little.

01:05:06.878 --> 01:05:09.878
You have lost your fingers? Seeker: Yes. Shri Mataji: How?

01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:11.903
Seeker: From a saw.

01:05:12.585 --> 01:05:14.260
Shri Mataji: Are you?

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:18.033
Put your, all right, no, no.

01:05:18.233 --> 01:05:20.348
Put your left hand on the Mother Earth. Left hand.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.260
Now, what about you My child?

01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:24.998
You feel it and

01:05:25.753 --> 01:05:27.391
goes away, is it?

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:31.714
Put your right hand towards Me. Right hand like that.

01:05:32.858 --> 01:05:34.544
Put it on your, on your lap.

01:05:35.149 --> 01:05:38.259
All right? Comfortably on the Mother Earth.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.220
Be relaxed, yes,

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.208
at the back you can put it.

01:05:42.408 --> 01:05:45.620
Just be relaxed, be relaxed. Just, it will work out.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.385
Gradually it will works out.

01:05:47.585 --> 01:05:50.493
It’s like the power flowing, all right.

01:05:54.028 --> 01:05:55.700
Shri Mataji: Hamsa.

01:05:56.847 --> 01:05:58.355
What is it?

01:05:59.731 --> 01:06:02.540
I couldn’t hear. What is the word he is using?

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.980
In Sanskrit, you are saying something?

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:07.816
I didn’t follow your word. Just ask him.

01:06:08.647 --> 01:06:11.615
What word is he using in Sanskrit language?

01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:17.228
Warren: Varashamsa.

01:06:17.429 --> 01:06:21.066
Shri Mataji: Varsamsha is not a
Sanskrit word, My child. Who’s told you?

01:06:21.502 --> 01:06:23.604
It’s not a Sanskrit word.

01:06:31.272 --> 01:06:34.128
Shri Mataji: No, no, just don’t do any mantras. Don’t chant.

01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:36.290
Don’t chant just now. You have to learn the whole

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:39.270
science about it, all right? Don’t chant.

01:06:41.406 --> 01:06:45.371
Don’t do any chanting of mantras.
You have to know the whole science of it.

01:06:45.572 --> 01:06:49.107
Don't do it with your closed eyes and closed brains.

01:06:49.307 --> 01:06:51.300
Have to understand why you are doing that.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.722
Put your hand like this, My child.

01:06:54.156 --> 01:06:55.740
In the blue.

01:06:57.103 --> 01:06:59.201
It works out better this way.

01:07:02.861 --> 01:07:04.361
Better?

01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:24.617
Shri Mataji: He has already.

01:07:25.217 --> 01:07:26.721
And then?

01:07:27.066 --> 01:07:28.860
He had it, before?

01:07:29.154 --> 01:07:30.775
What cancer?

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.860
You got pain there?

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.180
Just watch him. On the Vishuddhi.

01:07:43.243 --> 01:07:47.180
Can you, Warren, look after the gentleman there? It’s all right.

01:07:49.391 --> 01:07:52.180
You see, all these are chakras which are showing.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.864
He has a right Swadishthana.

01:07:55.682 --> 01:07:57.420
What sort of a cancer?

01:07:57.684 --> 01:07:59.684
He’s been to some guru?

01:08:00.211 --> 01:08:02.917
Sahaja Yogi: You been to any guru at all or nothing?

01:08:03.423 --> 01:08:05.956
Shri Mataji: Is it on the right-hand side you have a liver?

01:08:06.157 --> 01:08:07.860
Cirrhosis or something?

01:08:14.793 --> 01:08:16.740
Where do you have?

01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:18.740
In the liver?

01:08:25.804 --> 01:08:27.305
Muscle?

01:08:38.233 --> 01:08:40.500
Put your left up like that.

01:08:41.035 --> 01:08:44.687
Left hand like that, yes, left hand. Right towards Me.

01:08:48.527 --> 01:08:50.220
Can you bring some vibrated water?

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.020
Put it on his feet. So the Mother Earth can take away.

01:08:56.246 --> 01:08:58.801
Or ordinary water. Just put it on his feet.

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:01.820
Are you better now?

01:09:04.526 --> 01:09:06.303
Shri Mataji: There’s no breeze passing.

01:09:06.504 --> 01:09:08.899
Seeker: Only the physical one. Shri Mataji: No, no, not physical.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:12.930
It will be all right. You just stay, we will
tell you, if you have got it or not, all right.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.195
Ask this lady to put her hand towards Me like that. This way.

01:09:18.395 --> 01:09:20.260
Towards Me, you have put like this as if

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.984
you are asking for something. This one.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.973
You are all right. You got it.

01:09:27.924 --> 01:09:29.900
Now still those haven’t felt

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.381
any cool breeze, raise your hand, please.

01:09:37.371 --> 01:09:39.193
Warren: This fella has a cancer of the muscle

01:09:39.393 --> 01:09:41.735
on the right space of the right side.

01:09:41.936 --> 01:09:44.540
Shri Mataji: Is he, has he been running too much?

01:09:46.653 --> 01:09:49.820
Now stop all that jogging business! All right.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.202
Everything you do to such an extreme.

01:09:52.402 --> 01:09:54.020
Jogging, sun tanning,

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.853
I mean it’s madness. I just don’t understand.

01:09:57.701 --> 01:09:59.467
Going too far with your body.

01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:02.980
Then you develop cancer, you develop this problem, that problem.

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.420
What is the need to tan yourself to that extent?

01:10:13.838 --> 01:10:16.900
Now give up that jogger of yours, all right.

01:10:25.451 --> 01:10:27.940
Some possessions to do this kind of madness.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:32.140
Even old people of eighty years are
jogging – For what? I just don't know.

01:10:37.384 --> 01:10:39.380
They look quite funny, don’t they?

01:10:41.319 --> 01:10:44.340
To Me, I don’t know, if you feel that.

01:10:48.002 --> 01:10:50.260
You must accept your age and live with it.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.220
And be decent about it.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:55.300
The more grown-up you are, the more mature you are.

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:01.020
We can’t be horses, can we?

01:11:06.386 --> 01:11:09.425
All kinds of fads we accept; we shouldn’t.

01:11:09.626 --> 01:11:11.260
It’s not sensible.

01:11:13.014 --> 01:11:14.820
No common sense in that.

01:11:15.098 --> 01:11:17.540
Better. Are you better sir?

01:11:18.513 --> 01:11:20.300
Muktananda is it?

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.460
Did…Muktananda?

01:11:23.917 --> 01:11:26.187
You know how much money he’s got now?

01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:28.258
He’s got

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:31.463
sixty thousand – he’s dead now, thank God.

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:33.889
Sixty thousand

01:11:36.635 --> 01:11:39.053
crores. I don’t know if you understand crores.

01:11:39.254 --> 01:11:42.054
Warren: Six billion. Six thousand million.

01:11:42.273 --> 01:11:45.300
Shri Mataji: Six thousand million worth of

01:11:46.031 --> 01:11:49.362
diamonds he’s got. And both the disciples are fighting now.

01:11:49.616 --> 01:11:52.352
Must have also contributed to that.

01:12:00.085 --> 01:12:02.791
Are you all right? Better, Mrs Rao?

01:12:03.345 --> 01:12:05.427
Mrs Rao: I haven't so much tingling now.

01:12:05.628 --> 01:12:07.540
Shri Mataji: No, it’s better. It is passing.

01:12:07.748 --> 01:12:10.131
It will work out. You see, gradually it will works out.

01:12:10.331 --> 01:12:13.420
Have patience in yourself. You's better, aren’t you?

01:12:15.573 --> 01:12:17.260
Put on your hand, head.

01:12:17.754 --> 01:12:19.740
Left, Left hand. Just see

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.440
if there’s a cool breeze.

01:12:21.641 --> 01:12:24.841
Warren: Don’t look. Just put your attention there.

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:29.511
Shri Mataji: All right?

01:12:31.731 --> 01:12:34.454
It will work out. How are you? Are you better? Good.

01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:37.346
Be peaceful. First thing you feel is peaceful.

01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:39.604
You feel your peace within yourself.

01:12:42.823 --> 01:12:45.491
Now if the people who haven’t got it;

01:12:47.532 --> 01:12:49.572
if you raise your hands.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.529
Can you attend to them, some of the Sahaja Yogis?

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:58.101
Where are the Sahaja Yogis now?

01:12:58.302 --> 01:13:01.203
Can you attend to the people who haven’t got it there? One or two.

01:13:01.403 --> 01:13:03.580
Please keep your hands raised, all right.

01:13:05.228 --> 01:13:08.220
This lady hasn’t got it yet? What’s the problem with this one?

01:13:08.421 --> 01:13:12.421
What’s the problem? Are you keeping
all right, your health is all right, My child?

01:13:12.766 --> 01:13:14.269
What’s the problem?

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.441
Come here.

01:13:22.496 --> 01:13:25.070
You fell down? Seeker: No, motor car accident.

01:13:26.225 --> 01:13:28.476
Warren: Motor car accident. Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s why.

01:13:28.677 --> 01:13:30.967
Seeker: Also I am on medication of lithium. Shri Mataji: Medication?

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.147
Seeker: Of lithium. Warren: Lithium.

01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.700
She’s an alcoholic. Are you an alcoholic?

01:13:35.901 --> 01:13:37.020
Seeker: No. Oh yeah.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.260
Warren: A bit of everything drugs, alcohol. The whole thing.

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.848
She’s addicted, Mother.

01:13:42.144 --> 01:13:44.260
Shri Mataji: All right. Sit down. Turn around.

01:13:45.108 --> 01:13:47.005
All right? Now put your,

01:13:48.145 --> 01:13:49.890
take your feet

01:13:50.091 --> 01:13:52.931
that side and sit on the ground. Can you?

01:13:53.131 --> 01:13:55.437
Or can you give her a seat or something to sit down?

01:13:55.637 --> 01:13:57.260
It’s all right? Can you?

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:03.900
It’s terrible.

01:14:08.161 --> 01:14:10.672
It’s all right, but it’s working out.

01:14:11.659 --> 01:14:13.159
Warren: The right side.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.383
Shri Mataji: I know, it is the right side.

01:14:19.465 --> 01:14:20.965
Yes, my child?

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:23.632
Seeker: My hands are warm on the inside, cold on the outside.

01:14:25.656 --> 01:14:27.820
Shri Mataji: All right. Now put it up like that.

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:30.184
Just take it out like that, you see.

01:14:30.385 --> 01:14:33.260
No, no, no… Warren: Up, up and down.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.969
Up and down.

01:14:38.271 --> 01:14:41.475
Shri Mataji: Some people haven’t got
as yet attended? Ask somebody else?

01:14:41.675 --> 01:14:43.500
Some of the girls can come out.

01:14:54.302 --> 01:14:56.890
Have they made the rice alright? Warren: I don’t know Mother.

01:14:57.091 --> 01:14:58.940
Shri Mataji: Did they prepared the rice.

01:15:00.484 --> 01:15:02.700
Have you got some plates and things?

01:15:03.853 --> 01:15:06.845
This lady hasn’t been attended to, just see. Warren: Which one?

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:08.824
Shri Mataji: This one, there.

01:15:20.464 --> 01:15:21.984
Shri Mataji: Veins?

01:15:24.366 --> 01:15:26.778
I will work it out. All right. Don't you worry.

01:15:26.979 --> 01:15:28.672
Seeker: It doesn’t really worry me.

01:15:30.892 --> 01:15:33.425
Shri Mataji: It worries Me.

01:15:35.086 --> 01:15:37.002
Better now My child?

01:15:37.202 --> 01:15:38.984
Still the pain?

01:15:52.241 --> 01:15:55.099
Shri Mataji: Still taking a lot of these drugs are you?

01:15:56.929 --> 01:15:59.666
Sahaja Yogi: The lady is coming in forty minutes at the most.

01:16:00.047 --> 01:16:01.643
Forty minutes?

01:16:01.844 --> 01:16:04.260
Shri Mataji: To put the rice? Sahaja Yogi: Rice is on, yeah.

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.100
Shri Mataji: And what I have given should be put in a…,

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:11.140
should be put in a little... It is all right if the rice is very hot.

01:16:11.489 --> 01:16:14.412
Rice is ready? Sahaja Yogi: Nearly ready.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.220
Shri Mataji: But see that it is cooked well, otherwise…

01:16:17.452 --> 01:16:19.898
Ask Bill to look at it.

01:16:20.098 --> 01:16:23.420
Ask him to cook it well. See that’s very important.

01:16:50.132 --> 01:16:51.660
It’s here.

01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:02.445
Now give up all that. Give up all the drugs. You can.

01:17:02.645 --> 01:17:04.429
Have you reduced it now?

01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:06.263
Since you met Me?

01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:10.620
All right. You can give up overnight. Just put a little bit power.

01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:16.140
Right side is your willpower.

01:17:18.332 --> 01:17:20.298
Which is out of gear.

01:17:23.351 --> 01:17:26.820
How is this lady? Ask her to open her eyes.

01:17:27.451 --> 01:17:30.188
It’s on the Vishuddhi, what the problem is.

01:17:31.062 --> 01:17:33.896
Ask her to take out the cross for a while. Rosary.

01:17:34.112 --> 01:17:35.860
Just for a while.

01:17:40.795 --> 01:17:42.580
All you all right, My child?

01:17:43.015 --> 01:17:46.014
Better? Did you feel? No?

01:17:46.427 --> 01:17:49.090
Now we should see. You should feel it, why not?

01:17:49.814 --> 01:17:51.900
What’s that? Are you better?

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.599
No.

01:17:58.085 --> 01:18:01.300
I will see. All right? Are you better?

01:18:01.792 --> 01:18:04.492
Yeah. Yes.

01:18:07.388 --> 01:18:09.020
Are you all right?

01:18:10.315 --> 01:18:12.380
All right, I will see.

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:18.980
This is the place. All right?

01:18:19.619 --> 01:18:22.420
It’s your willpower. It’s finished.

01:18:23.535 --> 01:18:25.458
Now you must have a willpower

01:18:25.658 --> 01:18:27.640
because you have to live more

01:18:28.297 --> 01:18:30.037
and you have to enjoy your spirit

01:18:30.245 --> 01:18:32.753
and you have to give it to others, the enjoyment, all right?

01:18:32.954 --> 01:18:35.054
You have a purpose now.

01:18:48.829 --> 01:18:51.966
Right to the left. Right to the left.

01:18:54.546 --> 01:18:56.420
No, you are all right. I will work that out.

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.359
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.378
It’s all right, put your hand on the sciatica on the back.

01:19:01.579 --> 01:19:04.802
Ah, that’s all. You can put your
hand towards Me. You can do it yourself.

01:19:05.003 --> 01:19:06.695
You can cure yourself.

01:19:06.896 --> 01:19:09.140
Yes, of course, you can.

01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:12.408
That’s the minimum.

01:19:12.608 --> 01:19:14.220
Are you all right?

01:19:14.648 --> 01:19:16.590
Just don’t go into thinking just,

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:18.340
be alert.

01:19:19.173 --> 01:19:20.673
Be alert.

01:19:20.874 --> 01:19:24.222
Seeker: Mother, I think I am starting to feel the cool breeze.

01:19:25.059 --> 01:19:29.059
Old drugs when I was in my teens, you see taking drugs.

01:19:29.269 --> 01:19:31.715
Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Everything will be cleared.

01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:33.580
It’s like a flood.

01:19:35.628 --> 01:19:38.300
Don’t worry. Don’t worry about your past.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.260
Just don’t worry.

01:19:41.453 --> 01:19:43.401
That doesn’t exist for Me.

01:19:43.601 --> 01:19:45.580
You just go on thinking about

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.300
what wrong you have done. Forget it.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.785
I told you a hundred times to forget it. Let Me look after you.

01:20:00.446 --> 01:20:03.409
Actually, I don’t want to know about it. All right?

01:20:05.494 --> 01:20:09.202
But some were still very worried, so I said write to Me.

01:20:09.535 --> 01:20:11.513
They wrote and I never read them.

01:20:11.714 --> 01:20:13.344
Burnt them off.

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.460
What to do? How to convince them that…

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.936
Seeker: What can I do for my high blood pressure?

01:20:29.617 --> 01:20:33.540
Shri Mataji: No, no that will be automatically
taken over. Don’t you worry. You will be all right.

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.460
Blood pressure takes no time.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.816
Are you better My child now?

01:20:38.144 --> 01:20:39.780
All right?

01:21:13.115 --> 01:21:14.615
What’s it?

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.740
Warren: She's been to Muktananda. Why don't you just say,

01:21:17.947 --> 01:21:20.980
“Please forgive me Mother, for going
to him and give me my Self-realisation”.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.135
and straight away she felt it.
Shri Mataji: Really? Let's, better try.

01:21:24.335 --> 01:21:26.300
Say that. Come along, let’s see.

01:21:26.561 --> 01:21:29.961
Mother, forgive me, all right. Tell them. These two.

01:22:06.519 --> 01:22:08.019
Better?

01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:10.288
Seeker: Don’t know.

01:22:10.489 --> 01:22:12.460
Shri Mataji: Touch your hand yourself.

01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:16.927
No, see the pain.

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:21.340
Still there? Where?

01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:23.638
Wherever is the pain you put your hand.

01:22:25.128 --> 01:22:27.020
Just you put your hand.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.500
Better now?

01:22:38.498 --> 01:22:41.180
You have got every kind of a drug in your body, is it?

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:43.180
Left, right both sides.

01:22:48.622 --> 01:22:51.820
They are so particular in customs; we saw.

01:22:52.918 --> 01:22:54.740
Went round every

01:22:55.689 --> 01:22:59.380
bit of it, even pencils and the

01:23:00.222 --> 01:23:04.221
even the fountain pens they opened out to see the drugs.

01:23:04.421 --> 01:23:06.309
I don’t know how they penetrate.

01:23:06.509 --> 01:23:09.120
Yes, despite all that effort.

01:23:13.017 --> 01:23:16.140
You must help the police to find them out. Really.

01:23:19.466 --> 01:23:21.660
These are all anti-God things.

01:23:23.572 --> 01:23:25.605
Yes, I came out because

01:23:25.805 --> 01:23:27.507
I have a diplomatic passport.

01:23:27.707 --> 01:23:30.851
They didn’t bother Me at all. But these people were held up for

01:23:31.051 --> 01:23:33.798
about an hour. They went thoroughly into everything.

01:23:33.998 --> 01:23:37.291
Every bit of it, you see. Even a pencil, even a

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.660
sharpener every bit of it was opened out completely by them.

01:23:45.369 --> 01:23:47.380
Such a thorough examination.

01:23:49.377 --> 01:23:50.877
Better now?

01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:54.380
Ask for forgiveness.

01:23:54.839 --> 01:23:56.580
You too ask for forgiveness.

01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.865
For going to this horrible fellow.

01:23:59.066 --> 01:24:01.540
Take a chair. I think you will be better off.

01:24:03.546 --> 01:24:05.540
Are you all right now, My child?

01:24:23.237 --> 01:24:25.627
You're all right, I think you are better now?

01:24:26.534 --> 01:24:28.934
May God Bless You. Let’s see.

01:24:29.134 --> 01:24:31.642
May God Bless You. Now see if you feel the cool breeze.

01:24:31.842 --> 01:24:33.842
It is looking better.

01:24:35.233 --> 01:24:37.633
Now, who else? Sciatica. Come along.

01:24:40.878 --> 01:24:42.380
Turn around.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.940
Left side?

01:24:45.201 --> 01:24:47.701
More on the left hand? Seeker: It's on the left, yes.

01:24:47.902 --> 01:24:50.729
Shri Mataji: All right, just sit down with your stretched legs here.

01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:52.980
Stretch your legs fully.

01:24:54.427 --> 01:24:56.860
Let’s see. It's here.

01:24:58.709 --> 01:25:01.740
I have done medicine for the same reason.

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:03.659
All right?

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.140
To know the names, what you call them.

01:25:08.598 --> 01:25:11.205
How, how are you, My child? Felt it?

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:12.906
Good.

01:25:33.985 --> 01:25:35.500
Are you all right?

01:25:36.217 --> 01:25:39.087
Nothing much. What is you feel the

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:42.860
You feel the pull in the muscle?

01:25:45.153 --> 01:25:46.653
I see.

01:25:47.416 --> 01:25:49.006
You are better.

01:25:50.042 --> 01:25:52.853
Isn’t it? It is flowing down there.

01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:06.251
Good. But don’t do too strenuous exercise, all right.

01:26:06.451 --> 01:26:09.900
Try to avoid for the time being. You can walk at the most.

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.885
Be careful When you have your bath especially.

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:14.700
Just wipe out yourself well.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:17.515
All right, that is the thing – you leave yourself open

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:19.660
and you catch this as a cold thing.

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:21.887
It is melting. It is all right.

01:26:24.735 --> 01:26:26.264
What’s the matter?

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.780
Is she all right?

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.653
Sahaja Yogi: Liver. Shri Mataji: Got a liver?

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.540
Come on the Mother Earth. The best to cure your liver all right?

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:41.420
Just sit on Her, put your left hand

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:43.940
on the right side of your stomach.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.252
Lower, little lower, little lower. Just a little higher.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:49.347
Little high. Under the ribs.

01:26:49.547 --> 01:26:51.860
All right. Now push it hard and put your hand

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.931
on the Mother Earth. Right hand.

01:26:56.983 --> 01:26:58.940
You've cleared out.

01:26:59.243 --> 01:27:02.111
All right? Cleared out. May God Bless You.

01:27:02.502 --> 01:27:05.902
So sweet of you. Thank you very
much. Thank you. Are you going now?

01:27:06.103 --> 01:27:08.502
Seeker: This is my friend. Can you do something for her at home?

01:27:08.729 --> 01:27:11.899
Shri Mataji: Whom? She’s all right now. She’s all right.

01:27:12.099 --> 01:27:15.188
Yeah, she’s all right. May God Bless You. Thank you very much.

01:27:18.812 --> 01:27:21.345
Seeker: I'm in a lot of pain with my back at moment?

01:27:21.698 --> 01:27:23.229
Shri Mataji: So what do you want?

01:27:23.907 --> 01:27:25.420
All right. Come along.

01:27:25.862 --> 01:27:27.380
What do you do?

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:30.016
Seeker: I'm in the bank. And I have traction once a week.

01:27:30.217 --> 01:27:32.402
I've had that... twisted spine.

01:27:32.605 --> 01:27:35.167
Shri Mataji: All right. Now put your hand towards Me. Right one.

01:27:35.368 --> 01:27:37.232
Put this one on the stomach.

01:27:37.433 --> 01:27:39.264
Lower. Little bit.

01:27:40.392 --> 01:27:43.840
You just say, “Mother, are you the source of all the banks?”.

01:27:45.334 --> 01:27:46.852
Shri Mataji: Again.

01:27:47.889 --> 01:27:49.391
Again.

01:28:01.631 --> 01:28:03.940
All right? It’s working out.

01:28:05.506 --> 01:28:08.412
And the pain? All right. Come along, turn round.

01:28:08.613 --> 01:28:10.113
Sit down.

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.768
You see, in the bank, we are just cashiers aren’t we?

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.593
We don’t do anything.

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:21.559
We don’t own it, do we? Seeker: Exactly.

01:28:25.441 --> 01:28:28.528
Shri Mataji: Did you fix his right Vishuddhi?

01:28:28.729 --> 01:28:30.657
Warren: Which one, Mother? Shri Mataji: This gentleman.

01:28:30.857 --> 01:28:32.900
Warren: He’s got a total spine problem.

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.380
From top to bottom. And I…

01:28:38.025 --> 01:28:41.180
he’s a major problem from early,

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.904
what is it, curvature?

01:28:45.281 --> 01:28:47.822
Shri Mataji: Can you go forward a little bit?

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.802
It’s left Swadishthana. Have you been to anyone like that?

01:28:52.217 --> 01:28:54.005
Seeker: Nah, nah nothing like that, no.

01:28:54.206 --> 01:28:56.770
Warren: Who have you been to? Any spiritual seeking?

01:28:57.195 --> 01:29:00.720
Warren:  No. But who, what sort of seeking?

01:29:00.921 --> 01:29:04.080
Seeker: I am a Catholic.
Warren: You're Catholic. He is Catholic.

01:29:04.409 --> 01:29:07.311
Shri Mataji: All right, let him ask
the question of the Holy Ghost then.

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:10.180
Warren: Turn around and face Mother.

01:29:12.379 --> 01:29:14.220
Shri Mataji: Put your left hand towards Me.

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:18.340
And right hand on the Mother Earth.
On Mother Earth. Now ask a question.

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:20.420
Warren: Ask the question – “Mother, are you

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.571
incarnation of the Holy Ghost?”.

01:29:24.713 --> 01:29:27.380
Seeker: Are you incarnation of the Holy Ghost?

01:29:36.476 --> 01:29:38.745
Seems like cool, cool breeze.

01:29:40.433 --> 01:29:44.433
Shri Mataji: Ask the question,
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”.

01:29:52.405 --> 01:29:56.128
Shri Mataji: All right. It’s more physical. Just turn around.

01:29:57.809 --> 01:30:00.540
Warren: Did you feel that cool? Shri Mataji: Yes he did.

01:30:02.215 --> 01:30:05.900
Just move further. All Nabhi, see catching.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.340
He’s got it on the Nabhi. It's a very bad Nabhi.

01:30:10.026 --> 01:30:11.747
Now, what have you got?

01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.460
To begin with, this?

01:30:18.661 --> 01:30:21.057
Warren: Left swadhisthan the Nabhi is there.

01:30:21.758 --> 01:30:23.540
This little boy’s got,

01:30:23.911 --> 01:30:25.911
Shri Mataji: What’s it? Warren: - Diabetes.

01:30:26.057 --> 01:30:27.980
Shri Mataji: What this, Diabetes? Come along.

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.680
Come here.

01:30:30.122 --> 01:30:33.547
Take out their shoes. Please take out their shoes. Both?

01:30:36.247 --> 01:30:38.500
Shri Mataji: Take out your shoes, please.

01:30:45.465 --> 01:30:47.657
Very bad Nabhi he has got.

01:30:50.554 --> 01:30:53.421
Warren: Sit down, just sit down. That’s it.

01:30:54.027 --> 01:30:55.527
Shri Mataji: Let me see.

01:30:57.655 --> 01:30:59.522
No, towards Me.

01:30:59.723 --> 01:31:01.460
Warren: Turn your tummy towards…

01:31:02.925 --> 01:31:05.000
A bit closer still, bit closer.

01:31:27.757 --> 01:31:29.620
Shri Mataji: Did you feel the cool breeze,

01:31:29.866 --> 01:31:31.423
these two ladies?

01:31:34.697 --> 01:31:36.197
Good.

01:31:56.203 --> 01:31:58.179
Did you feel the cool breeze yourself?

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.460
Good now. Are you feeling peaceful now?

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:02.161
Better.

01:32:02.461 --> 01:32:05.904
Put your right hand on the spleen yourself.

01:32:10.956 --> 01:32:13.500
Shri Mataji: She’s more on the spleen, he’s more on the

01:32:13.766 --> 01:32:15.260
pancreas.

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.100
Warren: She’s on the spleen, he is on the pancreas.

01:32:22.031 --> 01:32:24.231
Shri Mataji: Better sir? Are you?

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.180
Warren: Is it easing?

01:32:30.648 --> 01:32:33.900
Shri Mataji: First of all, to ease out this centre is very bad you see,

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:35.600
than that one.

01:32:38.548 --> 01:32:41.180
Now push back, My foot.

01:32:43.535 --> 01:32:45.035
That’s good.

01:32:52.154 --> 01:32:54.597
Well feeling hot there? Seeker: Yes.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.717
Shri Mataji: Little hot? Seeker: Yes.

01:33:05.541 --> 01:33:08.226
Shri Mataji: How are you feeling now, this lady?

01:33:08.426 --> 01:33:11.100
Are you feeling better now? Good, good.

01:33:11.995 --> 01:33:13.751
Better. And in the hands?

01:33:13.952 --> 01:33:15.452
Seeker: I am still very hot.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.023
Shri Mataji: Now what you do is put left hand like that.

01:33:36.464 --> 01:33:38.106
Is she better? She’s all right.

01:33:38.306 --> 01:33:40.399
She’s all right. She’s very good I should say.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.751
Warren: Clearing nicely.

01:33:41.952 --> 01:33:44.276
Shri Mataji: You must get her some
olive oil or something to put in the head.

01:33:44.477 --> 01:33:47.752
Warren: But she’s having acupuncture
at the moment, Mother. She should stop it.

01:33:55.695 --> 01:33:57.195
Shri Mataji: No need.

01:33:59.154 --> 01:34:00.667
Acupuncture.

01:34:02.088 --> 01:34:03.679
You did too?

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.238
Seeker: Four times.

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:07.388
Shri Mataji: Oh God! Are you all right now?

01:34:07.584 --> 01:34:09.472
Seeker: I've just finished now I suppose.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.925
Shri Mataji: Better now my child? Seeker: It is easing now.

01:34:22.097 --> 01:34:25.580
Shri Mataji: Easing now, it is out.
It has to melt away. How are you?

01:34:26.551 --> 01:34:28.051
Terrible.

01:34:31.024 --> 01:34:33.988
Warren: Is it always on the left side?

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:36.252
Warren: Left Swadishthan.

01:34:36.453 --> 01:34:39.393
Shri Mataji: Is there any Sahaja Yogi here? Available?

01:34:39.594 --> 01:34:40.881
Warren: Who would you like Mother?

01:34:41.082 --> 01:34:43.490
Shri Mataji: Anyone. Get some ice for Me.

01:34:53.905 --> 01:34:55.780
He’s better now.

01:34:57.018 --> 01:34:58.603
Warren: It's good to clear him.

01:35:16.757 --> 01:35:19.765
Shri Mataji: Right heart. What about your father?

01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:28.939
Warren: Where is he, is he alive or? But he's incapacitated?

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.743
He was in an accident nine years ago but is he well otherwise?

01:35:33.186 --> 01:35:35.168
How is your relationship with him?

01:35:45.042 --> 01:35:47.804
Shri Mataji: Where is that? Have you kept the masala?

01:35:48.005 --> 01:35:50.405
Sahaja Yogini: Masala? I don’t know.

01:35:55.345 --> 01:35:57.506
Sahaja Yogini: Garam masala?

01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:18.611
Sahaja Yogini: Cut that fast and into smaller pieces.

01:36:25.728 --> 01:36:27.454
Shri Mataji: Where is it?

01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:40.339
This is My profession. I live by that.

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:42.815
That’s how I earn My living.

01:37:04.608 --> 01:37:06.999
This will bring about the whole thing.

01:37:34.879 --> 01:37:37.612
Hold it with the whole hand.

01:38:23.946 --> 01:38:25.973
Cumin seeds must be jeera.

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:41.111
This can be done in the blender?
Can you make smaller pieces in the blender?

01:38:58.594 --> 01:39:01.220
They are very nice some of these plates aren't they.

01:39:03.279 --> 01:39:06.606
They are old, aren’t they? You can’t get these nowadays.

01:39:15.151 --> 01:39:17.019
Cardamom powder?

01:39:50.977 --> 01:39:53.742
I am sorry we are using quite a lot of this.

01:41:01.263 --> 01:41:03.196
Shri Mataji: Are you sure this is saffron?

01:41:03.722 --> 01:41:07.376
Yogini: It's saffron, Mother but
I don’t think, I think it’s imitation.

01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:10.024
Shri Mataji: Salt?

01:41:20.295 --> 01:41:21.984
It's the colour?

01:41:32.701 --> 01:41:36.100
We can use it just to make the colour.

01:41:39.668 --> 01:41:41.465
They have written it is artificial.

01:41:41.666 --> 01:41:42.686
Yoginis: Yes, yes.

01:41:42.823 --> 01:41:45.580
Shri Mataji: But the thing is, if it would have been real

01:41:45.851 --> 01:41:48.260
it would have been better because

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:51.256
this gives the colour you see. Saffron.
