00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:19.630
I welcome
all of you from abroad, and this Kolhapur

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:32.800
is regarded as one of the deities’ temple,
which have three-and-a-half deities, or you

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.170
can say three-and-a-half coils of the Kundalini,
so it is said that, in this triangular bone

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:54.170
of Maharashtra - because it is surrounded
by, on all three sides by mountains, and the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:06.360
plateau is in the center so the all the three
sides make a nice triangle - is the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:21.009
Kundalini of the whole universe, of the whole
world, is expressed by Mother Earth in Maharashtra.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.789
These are three-and-a-half energies, which
are coiled together.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.079
The first one is of Mahakali.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:46.810
This Mahakali power is expressed in Tuljapur
as Bhavani, and Shivaji Maharaj used to come

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.590
on a horse all the way for miles together,
to get the darshan of this Bhavani at Tuljapur:

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.079
he knew this; and he had a sword which was
called as Bhavani talwar, and people said

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:12.599
that the Goddess Herself has given this sword
to him.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.010
Now the second one is Mahasaraswati, is at
Mahurgadh.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:32.810
We always sing Mahurgadawari song, that is
the one is Mahasaraswati, which is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.709
also called as Renuka Devi, that’s the right-sided
Mahasaraswati.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.769
Then the third one is Mahalakshmi, that is
at Kolhapur.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:03:00.549
Here a very bad demon called Kolasur was killed
by the Mother, so this place is specially

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:12.239
very holy for all of us; because you got your
Realization as the Kundalini went through

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:20.360
your Sushumna nadi, which is being nourished
by Mahalakshmi principle.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.940
So in the Temple they sit down - it’s a
Mahalakshmi’s Temple, but they sing that:

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.519
“Oh Ambe, please rise, please rise, please
rise.”

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:42.519
This comes with the full understanding of
the Sushumna nadi, but ninety-nine-point-nine

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:53.810
percent people don’t know, because all the
knowledge about Shakti is being lost due to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.379
the different timings, and people never worried
about it.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:27.060
So, one has to realize that in Indian shastras,
scriptures, Shakti is the most important thing.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:41.450
It is to be understood why: because, say now,
if you have a light or if you have fire, what

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.180
is the power of fire?

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.320
The power of fire can be that it can give
you light, it can burn away things, but supposing

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.260
it does not have its power, then who’ll
care for fire?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.090
Nothing.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:14.010
So anybody who hasn’t got the power of being
the Spirit, it is useless.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:23.440
So this power, this Shakti, has to be awakened
within us, because we do not have the power

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.610
of the Spirit.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.700
We have to have the power of the Spirit.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.120
That’s only possible if you get your Self
Realization.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.640
That is the reason it is very important that
we should pay attention to our power.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.610
Now this power is made as the power of a Mother.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:55.680
Mother is the most loving relationship, and
through that relationship all the love is

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.820
expressed.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:10.500
That is why the Shakti is that of a Mother,
and the affection, the love, the patience

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.160
that Mother has for Her children, the Shakti
too has the same powers, you see, and that

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.800
is how this Shakti never can harm you.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:32.160
Out of all these Shaktis, all these powers,
highest of all is what we call as the Kundalini,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.130
because without Her you cannot get Realization.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.430
But also we can say, higher than that, or
complementary to that, is Mahalakshmi power.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.190
Without the Mahalakshmi you cannot rise.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.410
This is the ladder through which this power
of Kundalini can rise.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:07:01.580
So both the powers are very important and
very much related to each other.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.230
Mahalakshmi principle starts when we have
finished with Lakshmi principle.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.490
Like in the West, people are fed up with affluence,
fed up with all the riches and all that, so

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.521
they are thinking: “What have we achieved?

00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:18.310
We have gone into imbalances, so what should
we do?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.380
We have to balance ourselves.”

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.020
So how do we balance ourselves?

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.150
We have to have the knowledge of the Spirit.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.940
That is called as aadhyatma.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.870
You have to know what is the knowledge of
the Spirit, and to know the knowledge of the

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:40.720
Spirit Kundalini has to be awakened, and that
you are to be connected to this all-pervading

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.520
Power.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:54.800
Once that happens, you just become one with
that energy and you get transformation within

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:02.010
yourself, because there is light and in the
light you can see all your problems, all your

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:07.280
defects; and also if you know how to correct
it, is the easiest thing to do is to get transformation

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.840
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.190
All of you have been very much transformed,
and now I find it difficult even to recognize

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:20.850
you, because all your faces are changed, your
attitudes are changed, you look so different,

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.790
so beautiful.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:37.340
Today it seems to be a special day for Me,
here in Mahalakshmi Temple, that Mahalakshmi

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:45.950
is being awakened, and I’m feeling really
in that state of thoughtless awareness.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:53.420
I don’t know how I’m talking; and I am
merged just in the meditative mood, absolutely

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.710
into meditative mood.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:04.460
Because when you are in the center you don’t
think, you are in meditation.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.450
That is why Mahalakshmi is very important.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:18.070
So when you are fed up, you can feel there’s
something missing, and then you take to Mahalakshmi

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.500
principle.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:26.210
But in India because of so many saints, we
feel that we should short-circuit it.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:37.380
First let us develop our own aadhyatma, let
us develop our knowledge of atma and then

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:44.510
take to science, so there is no more imbalance
within us; because without the foundation

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:51.350
of aadhyatma, knowledge of the Spirit, you
take to any kind of progress, you can topple

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.350
down.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:59.180
That’s why all the Western entrepreneurs,
enterprises and also projections of religion

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.860
have gone to waste, because there has been
no balance.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.370
It is important that we must have the balance
within ourselves.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:20.260
Now in India we have people who have this
idea, at least that you have to rise higher

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:31.230
than materialism and that you have to become
one with the Virata, part and parcel of the

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.230
whole.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:38.130
This they know, and that’s what, by knowing
that, once they get to Sahaja Yoga, they grow

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:45.840
very deeply; the depth, the depth they have
achieved with this faith, that we have to

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:53.700
be self-realized, and that we have to feel
the all-pervading Power.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.750
This conviction itself gives them the depth
and so when they achieve Realization, they

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.470
just go down very deep.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:08.430
But most surprising, people who have never
heard about Ganesha, who have never heard

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:15.680
about Kolhapur, have never heard about Mahalakshmi
are sometimes much, much better, much more

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:22.270
deeper than the people who know all these
things by heart.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:30.970
So one can deduct that those who know outwardly,
those who know through their books, or through

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:37.160
some gurus who teach them something, are absolutely
outside.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:48.890
They have nothing in them to tell us because
they have had no experience of the Self, no

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.920
experience of the Self.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:01.410
That’s only possible when your Kundalini
rises and breaks your Brahmarandra.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:07.779
That is the time the first experience comes
to you of this all-pervading Power.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:17.040
So all those people who have been only just
praying to Mahalakshmi, have been going to

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:26.360
Her, doing a lot of penances, fasting, this,
that, have no idea as to what Mahalakshmi

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:33.230
wants, and they always complain to Me: “Mother,
we have done this, we have done that.”

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.440
People are very religious.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.250
They are doing all kinds of ritualism, what
we call as karmakanda, but with that you do

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:45.250
not reach where you have to reach.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:53.150
So one has to understand that whatever has
been written and told about all these great

00:12:53.150 --> 00:13:02.370
things in India, people may know in words,
but in experience they do not know.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:08.630
So Sahaja Yoga is very important to give them
this experience, so that they can really verify

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:20.960
whatever is said in the science of spirituality
about getting Realization, is absolutely true.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.089
Not only that but it’s very practical, and
every person who gets Realization can understand

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:32.040
it very well.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.240
So we are here in a very holy place, full
of unholy people.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:49.450
But still there are some very, very good people
here also, and because of Mahalakshmi, they

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:58.970
make very good ornaments because these ornaments
are offered to the Goddess.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:09.490
You can feel there a kind of a subdued feeling
for God, feeling for spirituality, but they

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:16.940
do not have the experience that you have got,
so you are much higher than all of them.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:22.040
And those who have the experience can feel
more, once they go to the Temple, if you can

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.690
go to the Temple to see the place also; but
give yourself a big bandhan because I have

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.920
seen it, next to the deity there are very
funny people sitting.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.950
They’re doing all kinds of commercial activities.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.490
They are selling flowers, they are selling
this, selling everything.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.220
So you have to be careful, with a bandhan
you can go and see for yourself.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:53.830
Now they say that this Temple is made because
it’s a swayambhu – it’s the one that

00:14:53.830 --> 00:15:01.560
has come out of Mother Earth – you can see
yourself if there are vibrations and moreover,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:09.290
you must know that this puja of these deities
are done by people who are not at all in any

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:16.220
way religious, but are just commercial people.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:26.010
Commercialism can never give you any satisfaction,
can never give you at all any satisfaction.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:37.040
Apart from that it can take you to something
unknown, of dangerous shores.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:49.120
But if your faith is pure, without any greed,
without any demands, then you develop your

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:58.390
depth within yourself; which is very helpful
after Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:11.470
It’s a remarkable thing how this Shri Chakra
is here and how they have made the complete

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.490
calculation of Shri Chakra.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:24.630
I met a scientist in Russia, in Moscow, who
has done a research, very much big research

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.050
on this Shri Chakra.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:33.700
Now, so we have Shri Chakra on the right side,
on the left-hand side we have Lalita Chakra,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:46.360
so all the things that we do with hands after
Realization are worked through, on the right-hand

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.610
side Shri Chakra, on the left-hand side Lalita
Chakra.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:58.170
Now how it works is a very complicated thing,
but we don’t have to worry about that.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:04.630
As soon as you put your hand on somebody,
the chakra knows how to work it out.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:12.899
It works by itself, as if it is a built-in
mechanism within us, which knows what sort

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:18.559
of vibrations to be given to a particular
person for a particular cause, or a particular

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:22.860
purpose.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:29.289
If that person has certain defects also, these
chakras know what is to be emitted, how to

00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:31.309
work it out.

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:41.299
So it is not that we have the Kundalini awakening
only, these chakras are awakened, we also

00:17:41.299 --> 00:17:47.159
have these two chakras awakened within us
because of Kundalini.

00:17:47.159 --> 00:17:53.049
But if you have Vishuddi problem, then you
can find that your hands are stiff and you

00:17:53.049 --> 00:18:07.289
cannot feel guidance, or you can say, the
Divine intentions of Realization; because

00:18:07.289 --> 00:18:11.549
when you start using your hands you don’t
feel any vibrations, so how will you know

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:12.789
what’s happening?

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:20.160
It’s a very complicated thing, and for that
complicated thing these instruments are made

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.559
already, are prepared already; they are quite
equipped with all the knowledge that is necessary,

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:34.129
like a feedback as you call it, or we can
call it a complete programming is there.

00:18:34.129 --> 00:18:41.789
So as soon as you put your hand on a person,
the programming starts working it out.

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:48.440
Because it is programming is done by God Almighty,
it can never be wrong.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:19:01.679
It cannot be two different things, as far
as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:14.980
I have been thinking about writing about all
these big, big peethas that are in India,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:22.840
so it will be helpful to you as well as to
others in India.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:30.259
But here the atmosphere is so bad, as if to
think of God, to talk of God is absolutely

00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:34.090
wrong, you cannot say.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:43.139
The people are in illusion, and they think
that all these talks has brought us nothing.

00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:57.740
To them it is the progress of the West is
more effective, more apparent, that they can

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:05.720
see how you have progressed in materialism,
and they can’t understand how we could progress

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:18.539
with aadhyatma very much in the area of physical
development or mental development.

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:25.450
So now we come to a point where we realize
that it is very important for all the Western

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:32.580
people to have the foundation of aadhyatma.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:42.129
For that it is important to give up some of
your conditionings, because this knowledge

00:20:42.129 --> 00:20:45.639
is coming definitely from India.

00:20:45.639 --> 00:20:51.200
I mean the Indians had all the knowledge of
your medical science, this science, that science,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200
that science.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:02.690
But God’s science is in India, and for that,
what are you going to do?

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:09.029
When the question of God’s science is concerned,
what are you going to do about it?

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:15.769
How are you going to work it out, that this
is the science of God, and the God’s science

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:26.200
has to be understood with full dedication
and devotion?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:34.009
Because of the conditioning of the Western
influence, the Western progress, sometimes

00:21:34.009 --> 00:21:43.799
we just do not know how to grasp this knowledge
within ourselves; very difficult.

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:51.250
But if you can understand that, as for science
we had to accept it fully from the West, you

00:21:51.250 --> 00:22:00.750
have to accept the knowledge of your Spirit
from the East, East has the knowledge of the

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:06.970
Spirit: for that you have to be ready to receive
it.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:12.460
But if you are still in your arrogance, if
you are still in your own conditionings, then

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.580
you cannot do it.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:23.879
Like a boy who comes from a village, who has
never known about science, and you suddenly

00:22:23.879 --> 00:22:27.909
put him in a science college, he’ll say:
“What is this nonsense, what’s all this

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:28.909
all?

00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:30.039
I have never known these things.

00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:33.799
Why should I use a test tube, why should I
go in the laboratory?”

00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:39.860
All kinds of things he can start saying, and
this conditioning is there.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:45.169
Then he’ll run away from school within one
year or two year, maybe earlier, and that

00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:58.659
is what I find is their conditioning, which
turns away many people from Sahaja Yoga after

00:22:58.659 --> 00:23:01.879
some time.

00:23:01.879 --> 00:23:06.669
So we must watch our conditionings, what sort
of conditionings we have; while the Indians

00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:13.489
have conditionings of so-called religious
beliefs and this ritualism, this, that, they

00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:17.169
are very much conditioned also.

00:23:17.169 --> 00:23:22.669
But is easy to overcome that when you realize
that whatever your worship: for example, in

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:31.549
India everybody has a kuladevata, means the
family’s goddess, everybody has; they must

00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:35.789
worship that goddess, particular goddess,
everybody has.

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:43.859
So they have to, if they just ask: “Mother,
are You that Goddess?” the vibrations start

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:44.859
flowing.

00:23:44.859 --> 00:24:03.269
So the conditioning gets very easily eradicated,
but the mental acceptance of something is

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:05.789
very difficult to go.

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:13.419
And I’ve seen also when they get married
or marriage is arranged, they go mental.

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:14.419
They go mental.

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:22.559
If you go mental, then you cannot understand
many things.

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:25.809
But if you are spiritual, then you can understand.

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:30.899
For example, we see Mother Earth giving us
these flowers and all that, how can we go

00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:31.899
mental about it?

00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:32.899
It’s a living process.

00:24:32.899 --> 00:24:36.259
For any living process we cannot get mental.

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:40.730
So now you will say: “All right, this is
because of seed has got this, and the seed

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.399
is planted”; but how, why?

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:46.509
That you can’t answer, can never answer.

00:24:46.509 --> 00:24:47.879
Then you’ll keep quiet.

00:24:47.879 --> 00:24:54.859
But say if there’s a sage, he’ll say:
“All right, this is Mother Earth, She wants

00:24:54.859 --> 00:25:03.600
to give to Her children, these flowers, fruits,
these trees, so She’s working it out.”

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:12.179
So one has to jump from one conditioning of
materialism.

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:17.950
Now you should see in matter, energy never
moves.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.149
Energy is stationary, it never moves.

00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:30.889
And also energies which are moving, so-called,
like electricity, this, that, are absolutely

00:25:30.889 --> 00:25:32.369
blind.

00:25:32.369 --> 00:25:37.150
Supposing there is electricity here flowing,
all right, well and good, but supposing somebody

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.710
stops it, it will stop.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.649
It has no mind, it is a mindless thing.

00:25:43.649 --> 00:25:46.989
So in materialism you become mindless.

00:25:46.989 --> 00:25:52.000
You start seeing also that within yourself,
that you have become mindless; and becoming

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:03.299
absolutely, absolutely, I should say, like
robots sometimes, which is mindless, which

00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:06.640
is fixed, fixed quantity.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.899
And I see very much clearly, in the West I’ve
seen, that people have very fixed ideas.

00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:19.429
It’s difficult for them to get out of it
because they don’t have that movement towards

00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:31.870
the spiritual subtlety, where one can use
the mind to do something.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.659
We would say that Mother Earth has got the
mind.

00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:40.380
Now that nobody can believe in the West, except
for Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:47.559
That the Mother Earth produces these vigrahas,
She produces these deities, nobody will believe.

00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:53.100
How can you believe such a thing, that this
Mother Earth thinks, that this Mother Earth

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.379
produces these things?

00:26:55.379 --> 00:26:58.389
But logically you can see, logically.

00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:59.389
Logically.

00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:07.470
Say a tree has a certain height, the fruits
have a certain shape, certain colors, flowers

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:13.200
same: who changes all the seasons, specially
in India is very clear-cut six seasons?

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:19.900
It’s called as Ritambhara pragya in the
Hatha Yoga.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:27.350
Now that is the One which is a Lady, which
thinks.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:36.210
She has a mind of Her own, She decides and
She works out everything.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:46.320
This concept was doubly denied in the West,
is first is that they cannot accept a Goddess.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.499
Woman has no part.

00:27:48.499 --> 00:27:56.499
Right from Socrates onward, nobody has talked
much about a Woman, except of course there

00:27:56.499 --> 00:28:01.190
is Athena and all that, but it’s very minor
roles they have.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:09.860
Greeks had goddesses who were just like human
beings, so that also gets ruled out, and very

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.999
little was accepted; and when Christianity
came, somehow or other Christians saw to it

00:28:14.999 --> 00:28:19.779
that there should be no mention of the Mother
in any way.

00:28:19.779 --> 00:28:22.871
But despite that, people worshipped the Mother.

00:28:22.871 --> 00:28:27.950
They worshipped the Mother of Christ as, some
like a Goddess; though in the Bible She’s

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:37.479
talked as a “woman”, in a very derogatory
style She’s addressed.

00:28:37.479 --> 00:28:47.269
So the conditioning of people is about the
power of God who hangs somewhere in the air,

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:58.289
that He’s there and that He gives us everything;
but what is the communication?

00:28:58.289 --> 00:29:02.419
What is the justification or what is the logical
thing, how to explain?

00:29:02.419 --> 00:29:04.340
So you have to say: “It is a mystery.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.669
God is a mystery.

00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:07.350
He hangs somewhere in the air.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.350
He does everything.”

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.289
And how can people believe in it?

00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:17.249
So the Christian conditioning has been even
worse than, I think, Jew conditioning because

00:29:17.249 --> 00:29:21.249
they just took it out, Christ’s Mother,
away; though the painters, artists wouldn’t

00:29:21.249 --> 00:29:25.690
do that, they wouldn’t accept: they had
the Mother there.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:30.593
But despite all that, the Motherhood has not
been respected that should have been, in the

00:29:30.593 --> 00:29:40.419
Bible, which is a very wrong thing, while
Mahalakshmi Herself incarnated as Mother Mary

00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:41.419
Herself.

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:47.679
And to say about Mahalakshmi as “a woman”,
I think is a great insult.

00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:53.489
And where women are insulted like this, where
the Goddesses are insulted, we cannot expect

00:29:53.489 --> 00:30:02.220
any spiritual growth unless and until you
accept that it’s the Shakti, is the Motherhood,

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:12.320
who is the only thing that’s the communication
between us and the Divinity.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:18.360
So this conditioning, Christian conditioning
has to go out, as far as the Motherhood is

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360
concerned.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:26.440
It’s very surprising sometimes when I see
how these people have tried to bring down

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:33.320
the level of a Goddess to just a woman.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:41.379
So this is a very big blessing in India, that
they respect Mother as the Shakti, and that

00:30:41.379 --> 00:30:47.440
the whole thing is done by the movement of
the Shakti, by the thinking of the Shakti,

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.840
by the coordination and the understanding
and the planning of the Shakti only.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:58.619
It’s not done by God Almighty, He’s just
a spectator.

00:30:58.619 --> 00:31:00.729
She does everything.

00:31:00.729 --> 00:31:07.789
Once that concept can fit into your heads
properly, then you will see so many conditionings

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:14.249
will drop out; because religion was organized,
and in an organized religion you can put whatever

00:31:14.249 --> 00:31:18.259
you like, the way you want to put it, and
it was such a big mistake.

00:31:18.259 --> 00:31:30.999
By that people developed a lot of ego, lot
of things against women, and also the first

00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:38.350
sin they call the “original sin” and all
that is because of a woman, they really ill-treated

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.679
women and they have no respect for them.

00:31:42.679 --> 00:31:48.760
So the women have changed their role, and
instead of becoming mothers and goddesses,

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:55.599
they have tried to become something like actresses.

00:31:55.599 --> 00:32:04.779
But you can understand that without the power
there is no sense in anything, and this is

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:09.989
the power of Love and this is the power of
Truth.

00:32:09.989 --> 00:32:20.389
And once you get that power we should humble
down, and know that this power is within us,

00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:26.759
which has given us all this knowledge, which
has given us all this ability to raise the

00:32:26.759 --> 00:32:28.039
Kundalini.

00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:32.200
All this is because of energy within us, the
Shakti within us.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.281
Without that we are nothing.

00:32:33.281 --> 00:32:44.429
And that too is the Mother who has done it.

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:55.669
I do not know how much to press this point,
but it’s important; because I find, specially

00:32:55.669 --> 00:33:03.820
in England some newspaper people came: “How
do you feel as a guru, as a woman?”

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:14.210
I mean, it’s a kind of a thing, “a woman”,
as if I am sort of a, that movement where

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:19.409
women are starting a fight with the men, sort
of a thing, and now: “This is another guru

00:33:19.409 --> 00:33:24.529
who is a woman, so She should be supported,”
or some sort of a nonsense like that.

00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:29.990
It’s the only the Mother who does this job,
so there’s no question of asking such a

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.169
question.

00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:40.729
But that’s what it is, that we should first
know that it’s the feminine quality of a

00:33:40.729 --> 00:33:50.369
woman as a mother, is very powerful.

00:33:50.369 --> 00:33:59.950
But we should encourage it and try to develop
it, so that spiritually you can communicate,

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:06.210
spiritually you can imbibe these qualities
for your own children.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:15.659
The mothers who do not have aadhyatma can
never develop good children with proper emotions,

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:25.940
with proper value system of morality.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:33.950
So it is very important for every mother to
be very proud that they are mothers, and for

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:39.520
girls who are going to be mothers to be very
proud that they are going to be mothers, and

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.039
that they represent the Shakti.

00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:51.079
So now then, what is the part of the men is
to take full advantage of that power, by understanding

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:57.230
it, by complementing, by looking after that
power.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.730
I’m not talking only about your wives.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:11.000
I’m talking about your sisters, your daughters,
your mothers, and the whole society, where

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.840
women are to be respected, and they have to
be respectable.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:22.349
And women should try to be respectable, to
try to know that they are the powers and they

00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:27.650
are the ones who will be used by this Divine
power as channels, more than men.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:34.570
But if they are useless, then of course they
wouldn’t bother about them, they would like

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:38.000
to bother then about men, much more than what
you are.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.329
So it is important to understand what is your
role in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:45.210
This is your role in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.250
And I am sure you can work it out.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.130
You can manage this part.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:58.270
You can equip yourself for this role, which
is so beautiful and so good.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:04.819
So much can be said about Mahalakshmi, and
there’s no end to it, but I think later

00:36:04.819 --> 00:36:10.520
on we should keep this program on every year,
and you all should come to Mahalakshmi Temple

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:17.220
here, to the, I mean the Kolhapur, and then
I’ll again tell you all about the Mother’s

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.270
qualities, what She is as Mahalakshmi.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:29.420
And today we’ll have the Shri Sukta.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:38.819
Shri Sukta is about Mahalakshmi’s qualities.

00:36:38.819 --> 00:36:44.819
I think we’ll have Ganesha Stuthi and then
we’ll have this.

00:36:44.819 --> 00:36:49.619
So seriously you must understand what is it…

00:36:49.619 --> 00:37:11.470
I’m just in meditative mood today, I don’t
know what I’m talking; because this Mahalakshmi

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:17.290
is a thing that goes, finishes everything
else.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:22.080
Left, right is finished now, you are just
in Mahalakshmi state: what to do?

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:28.950
“Mahalakshmi state” means nirvichar, nirvikalp,
beyond that, I don’t know what stages it

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:29.950
is.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:37.619
It comes down a little bit, then again it
goes back to

00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:38.619
the same.

00:37:38.619 --> 00:38:08.890
[End of English part of talk]
