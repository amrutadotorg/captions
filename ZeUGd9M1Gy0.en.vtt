00:00:01.796 --> 00:00:08.476
You can't imagine how a Mother who has so many beautiful children

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:14.236
sees them in such joyous mood

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:20.796
with their families, their children, nicely settled down.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:27.436
It's very satisfying to see you all so much

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:35.236
in joy and complete oneness with the Divine.

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:40.716
One has to realize only one thing:

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.236
that though you are many,

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:48.996
still compared to the population of this world, we are very few

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:55.236
who really know the true knowledge, the real knowledge.

00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:59.316
You are the people who are knowledgeable, no doubt,

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:08.156
but also knowledge which is not being adorned with truth

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:12.756
or which is not the true knowledge has no meaning.

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:18.916
All that vanishes into thin air because it is artificial.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:23.476
By your Kundalini awakening you all have achieved

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:27.396
that state where we can say you know.

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:31.636
You know what is the real knowledge is,

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:37.916
but think of the people who do not know what knowledge is.

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:43.556
We take, for example we say that

00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:46.716
our knowledge is nothing but love,

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:50.396
but one should understand the discrimination.

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:54.236
The knowledge that is love within you

00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:59.076
is just emitting out from your being.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:03.076
You don't have to assert, you don't have to think,

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:05.716
you don't have to read some sort of a poetry

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.276
or go into some romantic mood

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:18.156
just pure love which emits, and this is the knowledge also.

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:22.836
How you have to relate it is this way:

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:29.436
the knowledge that you have about yourself is evident,

00:02:29.596 --> 00:02:32.796
is absolutely expressed on your fingertips,

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:35.396
and about others also.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:39.236
You know about others and about yourself.

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:48.436
This is the greatest subtle knowledge you have.

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:50.316
No one knows like that.

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:56.396
Apart from you people, no one knows about themselves or about others.

00:02:56.556 --> 00:02:59.556
So this knowledge that has come to you,

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:04.996
which is extremely subtle,

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:10.156
extremely secretive, absolutely secret.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:13.916
If you know about somebody, you know.

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:17.916
Others do not know that you know about them,

00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:23.316
and so this knowledge that you have got is nothing but love.

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:29.076
It's very difficult to make knowledge and love put together,

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:32.636
because our idea of knowledge is very different,

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.156
what we read from the books.

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:38.236
How can you love from the books?

00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:40.996
What love means, our attachments

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:44.916
to us, in ignorance we get attached

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:51.436
to people, to children, to family, to things.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:58.476
By getting attachment it is proved that we do not have the knowledge.

00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:01.916
If you have the knowledge then all attachments

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:06.316
should just drop out and you should become a global personality,

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:08.116
a drop in the ocean.

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:10.356
For example, we are attached to many things,

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:14.316
like we are attached to our family.

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:18.396
Something happens in the family we get very disturbed,

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:19.796
we can't bear it.

00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:23.276
If anything happens to our children, we feel horrible,

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:26.236
it's just the whole world is falling on you.

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:32.316
Then from family you move on. You are attached to your friends,

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:36.796
to your neighbors; you are also attached to your country.

00:04:36.956 --> 00:04:41.836
Attachment to your country is also not knowledge.

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:44.796
Once you are a realized soul,

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:48.636
you just start seeing your country clearly:

00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:55.076
what wrong it has got, what ignorance it has got,

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:57.556
in what darkness it exists,

00:04:57.716 --> 00:05:03.836
and in what way it is quarrelling, fighting for rights and things.

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:07.556
But with the knowledge that you have within yourself,

00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:12.396
you see it so clearly what is the problem of your country

00:05:12.556 --> 00:05:19.156
then you try to improve that through your love,

00:05:19.316 --> 00:05:23.596
means the power of your knowledge is love.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:26.236
If you have all the knowledge within you,

00:05:26.396 --> 00:05:31.716
and if you are just sitting at home and meditating, it has no meaning.

00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:35.916
What you have to go is to go about, tell people

00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:40.156
you have to meet other people, your friends, your family

00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:45.716
and other relations about your knowledge.

00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:51.596
If you cannot do that, then your knowledge is not with love.

00:05:51.756 --> 00:05:54.396
It's such a connection between the two.

00:05:54.556 --> 00:05:58.076
You feel like telling everybody that you've got your realization.

00:05:58.236 --> 00:06:02.236
You feel like telling everyone that you are a realized soul,

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:05.476
but in that you feel that you are expressing your ego.

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:08.996
All right, by some other ways, some other methods,

00:06:09.156 --> 00:06:13.956
you can express to them that you have the true knowledge.

00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:18.916
When you have the false knowledge you can get ego.

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:22.836
You can think that "I know so much, I know about this,

00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:29.756
I know the color of the carpets, all the shades, everything."

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:34.316
Any stupid thing if you know, you think that you are very great.

00:06:34.476 --> 00:06:37.316
That's the sign of stupidity in your head also,

00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:40.836
that you think this is very great to know.

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:42.916
Now we have discovered

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:49.356
that through all kinds of acquiring knowledge in the whole world,

00:06:49.516 --> 00:06:52.716
what we have achieved? Nothing.

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:56.716
There are wars going on.

00:06:56.876 --> 00:07:00.556
There's all kinds of destructions coming in.

00:07:00.716 --> 00:07:06.436
I saw on the television this George.

00:07:06.596 --> 00:07:10.716
It's a whirlwind which is going round and is killing so many people;

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:15.156
is destroying so many people without understanding what he is doing,

00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:18.116
but he's there and he's acting very well.

00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:21.436
So is it that he doesn't understand,

00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:24.356
or is it that he understands

00:07:24.516 --> 00:07:28.876
and that he is doing something just to correct people?

00:07:29.036 --> 00:07:31.556
This also we should have full idea.

00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:36.556
Like yesterday when I came here it was raining heavily,

00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:40.236
and then I sat down and suddenly it stopped,

00:07:40.396 --> 00:07:42.996
stopped till the whole program was over.

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:47.636
Till I spoke it was not working,

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:52.316
but suddenly when you started clapping, also it started clapping

00:07:52.476 --> 00:08:00.556
that's what it was. So even the nature knows who you are,

00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:04.236
but you must know the nature, this is the point.

00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:10.836
Nature will act according to what your level of spirituality is.

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:13.356
Surprisingly I always felt

00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:16.396
that there cannot be levels of spirituality.

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:20.476
I felt that once you get realization you are there,

00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:24.476
but later on discovered I was wrong; it is not so.

00:08:24.636 --> 00:08:27.516
Even after getting realization, I found

00:08:27.676 --> 00:08:33.476
people had so many obstructions in rising.

00:08:33.636 --> 00:08:38.716
There were so many temptations which were keeping them down.

00:08:38.876 --> 00:08:45.396
So one had to work out on different chakras, different nadis,

00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:48.396
somehow or other to make you perfect,

00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:52.276
because the perfection within only will give you

00:08:52.436 --> 00:08:56.316
the authority to use this knowledge.

00:08:56.476 --> 00:09:00.196
There are as I told you two ways of doing it.

00:09:00.356 --> 00:09:04.276
The other day I told you that you should not react.

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:06.796
It's human nature to react.

00:09:06.956 --> 00:09:08.516
It's absolutely human,

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:12.476
but if you have to become superhuman, you should not react.

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:16.316
By not reacting you will grow, definitely you'll grow,

00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:19.316
but if you react then you cannot grow,

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:24.356
because you are working under the pressure of other thing

00:09:24.516 --> 00:09:26.436
that is not yourself.

00:09:26.596 --> 00:09:29.276
Now supposing as I said I see these carpets,

00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:31.556
I know the color and this and that,

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:33.996
and I react to it - finished.

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:38.796
I will not have any sense of judgment if I react to it,

00:09:38.956 --> 00:09:40.796
but if I don't react,

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:45.236
then I'll know whether these carpets have got vibrations or not.

00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:47.756
Are they emitting vibrations or not?

00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:53.556
Now what are these vibrations? That is the love.

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:56.556
So the communication is like this: if you have the light

00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:58.916
you can see things.

00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:01.556
So when you see things the light is there,

00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:04.396
and light gives you the perception,

00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:07.156
gives you the vision to see things.

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:10.316
In the same way when you are enlightened,

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:14.356
what happens that these vibrations start flowing,

00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:15.916
just like the light,

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:21.236
and in that light you can see things which are good and which are bad.

00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:29.236
But sometimes you put the same parameters as human beings do.

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:34.476
Like you go to some house, a very nice house, very good house.

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:37.476
All these things make you very happy;

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:40.876
but actually, what about that house?

00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:48.396
Is it having good vibrations or it's having bad vibrations?

00:10:48.556 --> 00:10:51.636
Is it worth living there or not?

00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:54.156
Like the other day they told Me they can

00:10:54.316 --> 00:10:57.116
get a very nice place in Milan,

00:10:57.276 --> 00:11:00.916
little beyond Milan, on rent, very cheap.

00:11:01.076 --> 00:11:03.556
I said, "Why is it so cheap?"

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:06.396
Immediately I felt the vibrations of the place.

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:10.076
I said, "Did you go and see the vibrations of that place?"

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:13.236
They went and saw - this was all burning.

00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:17.556
Then they found out that there was a Scientology there for years together.

00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:21.156
I said, "That's not the place where you can live.

00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:24.956
You have to have a very pure place.

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:29.196
Even hut of a poor man would be better

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.076
than this comfortable so-called place."

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:36.356
So one has to use the vibrations all the time

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:39.596
to understand everything that you are doing.

00:11:39.756 --> 00:11:42.116
In that also it can be misleading them.

00:11:42.276 --> 00:11:44.876
Some people feel vibrations

00:11:45.036 --> 00:11:48.076
and they tell Me, "Mother, I felt the vibrations

00:11:48.236 --> 00:11:50.876
and I felt I should marry this man."

00:11:51.036 --> 00:11:53.716
I said, "You did fel the vibrations?"  "Yes"

00:11:53.876 --> 00:11:57.556
"Yes I did, very much, and I must marry this man."

00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:00.636
And when I see the man I see the bhoot in him.

00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:05.596
I said, "My God, what sort of vibrations this lady

00:12:05.756 --> 00:12:06.916
has felt about him?"

00:12:07.076 --> 00:12:11.436
So in your judgment what is there: there's no pure knowledge.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:15.996
So see how, how connected they are

00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:18.996
vibrations which is love;

00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:25.396
and also the other thing which you have to have is the knowledge,

00:12:25.556 --> 00:12:28.156
the pure knowledge, the true knowledge.

00:12:28.316 --> 00:12:34.196
We can say that pure knowledge and true knowledge is like the energy

00:12:34.356 --> 00:12:36.316
like electricity.

00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:43.796
And the way you feel it, the way you understand it,

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:48.316
it exists. That is love.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:52.396
People don't understand also what is the love is.

00:12:52.556 --> 00:12:56.316
They get mad after someone and say that,

00:12:56.476 --> 00:13:00.316
"Mother, I say I think that I am in love with that person."

00:13:00.476 --> 00:13:02.716
And after five days they'll come and say,

00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:06.556
"Mother, no, I won't have anything to do with that person."

00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:11.716
Why? Because you have not got the pure knowledge.

00:13:11.876 --> 00:13:16.196
You did not feel the pure knowledge

00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:19.156
in that person through your vibrations.

00:13:19.316 --> 00:13:21.436
Now see how connected it is.

00:13:21.596 --> 00:13:24.276
Like we can say the sun and the sunlight,

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.836
what is the difference between the two?

00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:30.556
Sun is there. When sun comes, there's sunlight.

00:13:30.716 --> 00:13:32.516
So what is the difference?

00:13:32.676 --> 00:13:37.236
Or we can say the moon and the moonlight; what is the difference?

00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:41.236
There is no difference in these two things

00:13:41.396 --> 00:13:44.636
one is the moon and another is the light.

00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:51.636
So all these things are very, very confusing,

00:13:51.796 --> 00:13:55.716
that we don't understand how confused we are about it,

00:13:55.876 --> 00:14:01.836
and we don't understand how our vibrations can mislead us.

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:07.236
Because vibrations are there, all right,

00:14:07.396 --> 00:14:10.716
but sometimes even if they are missing,

00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:13.636
just to justify yourself you will say,

00:14:13.796 --> 00:14:19.556
"We have vibrations and we feel that it's very good, excellent,"

00:14:19.716 --> 00:14:23.236
and later on you'll discover that it's not so.

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:26.916
So even now when we are realized souls,

00:14:27.076 --> 00:14:32.716
we should know what is encompassing us, which is around us;

00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:38.076
what is that which makes us feel that

00:14:38.236 --> 00:14:42.316
it's all right, it is good, we should have it.

00:14:42.476 --> 00:14:48.836
Once we start understanding that vibrations of pure knowledge

00:14:48.996 --> 00:14:51.996
are of a very different nature,

00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:54.956
then you're not attached to that person,

00:14:55.116 --> 00:14:57.236
you're not attached to that family,

00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:00.476
you're not attached to that country - nothing.

00:15:00.636 --> 00:15:06.076
But what you feel is the pure vibrations coming to you.

00:15:06.236 --> 00:15:09.076
This is the point which is very confusing

00:15:09.236 --> 00:15:13.436
when you say, "My vibrations are good. I like those vibrations"

00:15:13.596 --> 00:15:19.236
and while you jump into the ocean of filth.

00:15:19.396 --> 00:15:21.316
Many people have asked Me, "Mother,

00:15:21.476 --> 00:15:24.636
why is it sometimes we make mistakes?"

00:15:24.796 --> 00:15:30.076
You do not make mistakes. It's your ignorance, which is darkness,

00:15:30.236 --> 00:15:34.756
and that's why whenever you plunge into it you fall into trouble.

00:15:34.916 --> 00:15:43.236
So to understand that our knowledge has to be completely clear.

00:15:43.396 --> 00:15:47.756
Like in our house supposing we have a lamp that's dirty,

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:49.996
you cannot get the light.

00:15:50.156 --> 00:15:53.796
In the same way if our heart is not clean

00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:57.236
specially our heart, if it is not clean,

00:15:57.396 --> 00:16:02.236
then we start doing things believing that it's right,

00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:06.476
and by which we hurt yourself or others.

00:16:06.636 --> 00:16:10.556
It's a very, very common error in human nature

00:16:10.716 --> 00:16:15.396
to identify wrong things as right

00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:23.716
and just to make themselves look such a great, such a divine thing.

00:16:23.876 --> 00:16:26.796
As I told you now there are people who want to

00:16:26.956 --> 00:16:29.316
say, divide the country;

00:16:29.476 --> 00:16:32.396
simple reason they want to divide.

00:16:32.556 --> 00:16:36.036
Now they want to divide this thing

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:38.476
because they want to have importance.

00:16:38.636 --> 00:16:41.156
The few people who want their importance

00:16:41.316 --> 00:16:45.396
will instigate others, tell them, "All right, we must have freedom.

00:16:45.556 --> 00:16:48.956
If we have freedom we'll have this country for ourselves

00:16:49.116 --> 00:16:50.916
then we can develop ourselves."

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:54.836
Or a part of the country which is richer, which is better off,

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:57.476
they will think that "It's all right, we'll have

00:16:57.636 --> 00:17:00.716
all the money to ourselves, we'll have everything to ourselves,"

00:17:00.876 --> 00:17:05.796
so they divide. They can divide in the name of religion,

00:17:05.956 --> 00:17:09.236
in the name of prosperity - whatever it is.

00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:14.756
But if you divide the country actually you are facing a big problem,

00:17:14.916 --> 00:17:21.156
because you have seen that wherever people divide they fall into

00:17:21.316 --> 00:17:29.716
a kind of a dark, dark dungeon from where they cannot come out.

00:17:29.876 --> 00:17:31.836
It's just a few people

00:17:31.996 --> 00:17:38.676
whose ego is that they want to have some land as their own,

00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:43.436
but they die; not only die, some of them are murdered,

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:46.716
and like that idea

00:17:46.876 --> 00:17:50.996
that idea that "We'll have this possession of the land" goes away.

00:17:51.156 --> 00:17:55.636
So in the same way we can see on smaller things also.

00:17:55.796 --> 00:17:59.076
In smaller things also we are very much identified,

00:17:59.236 --> 00:18:02.996
that "If I have this thing then everything will be fine."

00:18:03.156 --> 00:18:07.316
You cannot understand how people just jump at things and say,

00:18:07.476 --> 00:18:09.916
"Oh Mother, this is ours,

00:18:10.076 --> 00:18:16.916
this is ours, we must do this for ourselves," openly.

00:18:17.076 --> 00:18:20.356
They don't think it's wrong to say that

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.796
"This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:28.316
And another says that "This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:18:28.476 --> 00:18:30.996
As long as there is this "my and I"

00:18:31.156 --> 00:18:34.236
that means there is no knowledge.

00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:36.876
The knowledge as I told you, pure knowledge

00:18:37.036 --> 00:18:40.756
is that which gives you a pure light.

00:18:40.916 --> 00:18:43.156
Pure light means pure vibrations.

00:18:43.316 --> 00:18:46.156
Now vibrations can be misleading as I told you,

00:18:46.316 --> 00:18:50.516
or could be the quantity of vibrations can be less or more.

00:18:50.676 --> 00:18:55.076
But there's another way to see - is to see for yourself,

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:58.636
why do you want to do a particular thing?

00:18:58.796 --> 00:19:04.316
Mental also you can use, parameter of mental understanding.

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:08.916
"Why do I want to do it? What is the gain for all the people?"

00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:12.236
If you start thinking from that angle

00:19:12.396 --> 00:19:15.236
that "What is the gain for others, what will they gain by this,

00:19:15.396 --> 00:19:17.636
why should I do it?" - you'll be amazed.

00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:21.556
You will get the real picture of what you are doing.

00:19:21.716 --> 00:19:26.276
So you must keep yourself all the time

00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:28.956
in a state where you witness yourself.

00:19:29.116 --> 00:19:34.556
You see yourself, that "Why am I doing this? What is the purpose?"

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.236
Sometimes it could be some conditioning,

00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:41.236
could be some sort of a psychological thing, could be anything.

00:19:41.396 --> 00:19:45.836
But if you start watching carefully "Why I'm doing it?"

00:19:45.996 --> 00:19:49.956
you'd be amazed that your vibrations itself

00:19:50.116 --> 00:19:52.916
will start telling you on your fingertips.

00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:56.636
But sometimes the vibrations are so superficially coming,

00:19:56.796 --> 00:20:00.996
"Ah, I got the vibrations, I'm this, I'm that."

00:20:01.156 --> 00:20:03.836
For this reason I am saying again and again,

00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:06.436
though you are such a nice family of Mine

00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:08.636
and we are all so much blessed

00:20:08.796 --> 00:20:12.596
and we have so much of knowledge with us,

00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:16.756
we should be very wise.

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:21.156
If there is no wisdom, if there is no wisdom,

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:24.996
we can never understand what we are doing.

00:20:25.156 --> 00:20:28.236
Now to develop this wisdom, what have you to do?

00:20:28.396 --> 00:20:31.836
See every time, if I say anything they'll come otherwise,

00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:36.756
"Mother, how do we get wisdom? What is the way to get the wisdom?"

00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:39.396
Wisdom you have already within you,

00:20:39.556 --> 00:20:43.236
Shri Ganesha is already there, who gives you the wisdom.

00:20:43.396 --> 00:20:46.636
But you must take to Shri Ganesh.

00:20:46.796 --> 00:20:50.636
There I find people become so much addicted to Shri Ganesh

00:20:50.796 --> 00:20:55.836
that they lose His identity completely,

00:20:55.996 --> 00:21:02.916
they become very slavish about the whole thing

00:21:03.076 --> 00:21:05.636
and they just believe that,

00:21:05.796 --> 00:21:10.836
oh, they are very spiritual, they are very great.

00:21:10.996 --> 00:21:15.116
All these false ideas are no good.

00:21:15.276 --> 00:21:19.596
Does your Ganesha gives you wisdom?

00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:25.796
Now you must count, how many wise things have you done so far?

00:21:25.956 --> 00:21:30.556
Where did you take a very wise decision?

00:21:30.716 --> 00:21:33.556
Have you been wise to do something,

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:37.156
or you have been just doing it because you are identified

00:21:37.316 --> 00:21:42.916
with a particular type of life or particular type of answer?

00:21:43.076 --> 00:21:48.476
So wisdom is a thing that gives you, first of all, complete peace.

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:53.236
If your wisdom is developed then you become very peaceful.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:56.596
Because whatever people may say, whatever they may do,

00:21:56.756 --> 00:22:00.396
whatever aggression they may do, whatever it is, you are peaceful.

00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:05.236
And you see the stupidity of the other person, of the other nations,

00:22:05.396 --> 00:22:08.556
and you understand why they are doing it.

00:22:08.716 --> 00:22:12.556
This wisdom is such an important thing in human being,

00:22:12.716 --> 00:22:17.396
because animals don't have so much wisdom as we have.

00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:21.516
Sometimes of course, sometimes we have even less than animals have.

00:22:21.676 --> 00:22:25.636
But still, by experience, you see,

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:29.156
we have to learn that we have been making mistakes.

00:22:29.316 --> 00:22:31.916
So many mistakes we have committed so far.

00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:37.316
Now are we going to commit more mistakes or are we going to be wise?

00:22:37.476 --> 00:22:41.036
Wisdom is not apparent outside.

00:22:41.196 --> 00:22:46.476
You can't say somebody is wise by looking at that person,

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:51.116
but in vibrations you will know that that person is extremely wise.

00:22:51.276 --> 00:22:53.316
He may speak; he may not speak.

00:22:53.476 --> 00:22:58.756
If he speaks he'll speak about something so deep,

00:22:58.916 --> 00:23:03.236
so wise, and so nice, without hurting you.

00:23:03.396 --> 00:23:05.916
This kind of a temperament

00:23:06.076 --> 00:23:10.396
if you develop is to become wise for every question.

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:14.316
For example, some are very attached to their children;

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:19.156
so much attached that they forget that they are part and parcel

00:23:19.316 --> 00:23:21.476
of this divine Force,

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:24.316
and they just start doing all kinds of things.

00:23:24.476 --> 00:23:28.716
The other day I met one lady whose son was very sick,

00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:30.956
and she took him to the hospital

00:23:31.116 --> 00:23:33.556
and doctors gave him all kinds of medicines,

00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:35.836
and he became even worse.

00:23:35.996 --> 00:23:39.156
Then she telephones to Me, "Mother, I don't know what happened,

00:23:39.316 --> 00:23:43.716
I went to the doctor and doctor gave him this and that treatment,

00:23:43.876 --> 00:23:45.996
and the child has become sick."

00:23:46.156 --> 00:23:48.556
But why didn't you ask Me before?

00:23:48.716 --> 00:23:51.316
Why did you go to the hospital first?

00:23:51.476 --> 00:23:55.916
Lack of wisdom. I'm there, why don't you ask?

00:23:56.076 --> 00:23:58.556
We had one case here in Cabella.

00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:04.156
There was one child who fell down and broke his arm.

00:24:04.316 --> 00:24:07.396
Now the mother didn't show any wisdom.

00:24:07.556 --> 00:24:09.556
She took the child to the hospital

00:24:09.716 --> 00:24:11.996
and the doctor said, "Tomorrow we are going to operate her

00:24:12.156 --> 00:24:15.036
and put some artificial arm inside."

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:19.556
But the father was sensible. He said, "All right, tomorrow, no?

00:24:19.716 --> 00:24:21.676
Today I'll take the child at home."

00:24:21.836 --> 00:24:24.716
He brought the child to Me in the night about three o'clock.

00:24:24.876 --> 00:24:27.996
I said, "All right." I put it right.

00:24:28.156 --> 00:24:31.396
Next day when he took it to the hospital the doctor said,

00:24:31.556 --> 00:24:35.556
"But now there's no need to operate because his arm is all right."

00:24:35.716 --> 00:24:36.996
See the difference?

00:24:37.156 --> 00:24:40.836
One is worried, immediately they'll go to the doctor,

00:24:40.996 --> 00:24:44.796
instead of consulting Me, asking Me. They are Sahaja yogis,

00:24:44.956 --> 00:24:48.916
but they will go and ask the doctor to do something or other.

00:24:49.076 --> 00:24:52.676
Once the doctors start doing something then they'll come to Me.

00:24:52.836 --> 00:24:57.756
There's lots of miracles must have taken place

00:24:57.916 --> 00:25:00.156
about Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

00:25:00.316 --> 00:25:04.316
and in that you should see the wisdom helps you.

00:25:04.476 --> 00:25:07.916
Of course My attention is there always, no doubt,

00:25:08.076 --> 00:25:14.396
but still you should not take it for granted; you have to ask.

00:25:14.556 --> 00:25:18.076
One day, you see, I was just sitting; I just thought

00:25:18.236 --> 00:25:23.396
that I should telephone somebody in the ashram of New York.

00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:25.516
I never telephone there.

00:25:25.676 --> 00:25:33.156
So I found out the phone number, we telephoned and asked if ...

00:25:33.316 --> 00:25:41.356
I said, "Is the child all right?" So the leader there was surprised,

00:25:41.516 --> 00:25:44.116
because that boy had fallen in the water

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:47.396
and was in the water for quite some time,

00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:50.796
and he was all filled with water, even his brain was

00:25:50.956 --> 00:25:54.876
filled with water. As usual there were some doctors who said

00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:57.716
that he cannot survive and even if he survives,

00:25:57.876 --> 00:26:02.236
his brain has so much water that he cannot be normal.

00:26:02.396 --> 00:26:08.716
So I just said that "Don't worry." I didn't know. Nobody told Me.

00:26:08.876 --> 00:26:13.076
"Don't worry. The boy will be all right completely."

00:26:13.236 --> 00:26:17.036
So they were surprised how I said so.

00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:19.476
Firstly how I knew

00:26:19.636 --> 00:26:21.996
that the boy had fallen, there was some boy like that.

00:26:22.156 --> 00:26:26.676
And then they didn't know how I said he'll be all right,

00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:31.156
and he was all right. He's perfectly all right.

00:26:31.316 --> 00:26:36.716
So they were surprised at My knowing about it

00:26:36.876 --> 00:26:43.636
how is it that Mother knows that there's a boy who is so sick?

00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:48.716
Here I will say it is pure knowledge.

00:26:48.876 --> 00:26:52.836
You see, My attention is always around you people

00:26:52.996 --> 00:26:55.636
always dealing with you people.

00:26:55.796 --> 00:27:01.636
And how I know is this: that this attention of Mine is global

00:27:01.796 --> 00:27:06.076
so anything happens to you, any upsetting takes place, any,

00:27:06.236 --> 00:27:11.716
I should say, deviation takes place

00:27:11.876 --> 00:27:14.156
My attention is there.

00:27:14.316 --> 00:27:17.716
And immediately I know there's something wrong somewhere,

00:27:17.916 --> 00:27:21.876
and I don't know how My attention goes to particular places,

00:27:22.036 --> 00:27:25.396
which makes it

00:27:25.556 --> 00:27:31.396
life better, it helps people in need.

00:27:31.556 --> 00:27:34.436
I don't do anything about this attention

00:27:34.596 --> 00:27:37.476
but this attention is the wisdom,

00:27:37.636 --> 00:27:39.916
the wisdom that spreads all over.

00:27:40.076 --> 00:27:44.836
With that wisdom you know what's wrong with another person

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:49.756
or any other organization that is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:52.036
Everything you come to know.

00:27:52.196 --> 00:27:56.276
If you want to know it's different, it just you know.

00:27:56.436 --> 00:27:58.556
Like you spread out everywhere.

00:27:58.716 --> 00:28:00.236
For example, if you have to telephone,

00:28:00.396 --> 00:28:02.156
then you have to use the telephone,

00:28:02.316 --> 00:28:05.996
but for Me I don't have to use the telephone, I just know.

00:28:06.156 --> 00:28:10.836
So this has come from a pure innocent wisdom.

00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:15.036
The innocent wisdom is just like a child

00:28:15.196 --> 00:28:18.236
It is everywhere, and it communicates

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:23.196
and it tells what's the matter, what's the problem is.

00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:27.156
Many people have been cured with Sahaja Yoga, many have been cured.

00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:30.356
Now if they can say that "Mother, how did we get cured,

00:28:30.516 --> 00:28:33.436
what have You done? Did You see our chakras?

00:28:33.596 --> 00:28:36.276
Did You find out what was wrong with us?"

00:28:36.436 --> 00:28:40.396
No, I haven't. I haven't, but I leave it,

00:28:40.556 --> 00:28:45.196
in My wisdom I leave it to Paramchaitanya to do the job.

00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:48.076
This is the main point is, that can you leave

00:28:48.236 --> 00:28:52.716
that can you leave everything to Paramchaitanya in your wisdom?

00:28:52.876 --> 00:28:55.876
If you cannot, then yet you have not felt

00:28:56.036 --> 00:29:00.236
the real knowledge within you.

00:29:00.396 --> 00:29:02.596
That is the level of some people are.

00:29:02.756 --> 00:29:06.436
I am not now so sure about those who get realization

00:29:06.596 --> 00:29:09.436
are all so much filled with pure knowledge.

00:29:09.596 --> 00:29:12.476
Some of them are, but not all of them.

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:18.756
With experience they learn. With meeting people, they learn.

00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:24.156
But as the wisdom, pure wisdom, is difficult for them

00:29:24.316 --> 00:29:31.476
because they do not rely entirely on the Paramchaitanya.

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:37.636
Everything happens, just Paramchaitanya knows,

00:29:37.796 --> 00:29:40.876
it understands, it organizes, it loves,

00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:45.596
it does everything. That's the Energy it is. It does everything.

00:29:45.756 --> 00:29:50.956
And how it manages, how we call coincidences are really organized

00:29:51.116 --> 00:29:52.836
by Paramchaitanya.

00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:57.556
As I told you yesterday the way the rain was,

00:29:57.716 --> 00:30:04.476
the rain came and went away. It has wisdom.

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:09.636
Innately it knows I am sitting here, the program is going to start

00:30:09.796 --> 00:30:11.316
stops!

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.236
Flowers know Me.

00:30:13.396 --> 00:30:15.996
You don't know, when we have flowers,

00:30:16.156 --> 00:30:18.836
they are of this size, I don't do anything to them;

00:30:18.996 --> 00:30:22.356
they start growing, growing like this, they blast like that.

00:30:22.516 --> 00:30:25.076
Now one would say, "Mother, how do they know?"

00:30:25.236 --> 00:30:29.996
Because they are natural. We are unnatural.

00:30:30.156 --> 00:30:34.836
We have taken so many artificialities as part and parcel of life.

00:30:34.996 --> 00:30:39.716
See all kinds of courtesies, this, that - all that's not necessary.

00:30:39.876 --> 00:30:43.716
All these stupid practices

00:30:43.876 --> 00:30:46.836
that we have adopted sometimes keep us away

00:30:46.996 --> 00:30:51.676
from pure knowledge. And when there's no pure knowledge,

00:30:51.836 --> 00:30:53.636
we don't know anything what's happening.

00:30:53.796 --> 00:30:57.196
We just get frightened for small things, upset for something.

00:30:57.356 --> 00:30:59.996
I mean it's something very surprising to see

00:31:00.156 --> 00:31:03.156
Sahaja yogis getting upset.

00:31:03.316 --> 00:31:07.196
Among the hundred people if supposing there's a problem,

00:31:07.356 --> 00:31:15.716
so if you are a Sahaja yogi you have to just witness, and see.

00:31:15.876 --> 00:31:20.716
If you cannot do that then you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:31:20.876 --> 00:31:27.156
But it's not like practicing, you know, like they say

00:31:27.316 --> 00:31:32.716
if you have to have the blessings of Shiva,

00:31:32.876 --> 00:31:36.076
you must say a hundred-and-eight times His name.

00:31:36.236 --> 00:31:39.076
That's not the way - He doesn't like it.

00:31:39.236 --> 00:31:44.156
You see, nobody likes that kind of a murmuring.

00:31:44.316 --> 00:31:47.516
You see somebody comes and takes your name all the time

00:31:47.676 --> 00:31:49.916
near your door, you will throw him out.

00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:52.516
So that's not the way, this is a wrong idea

00:31:52.676 --> 00:31:55.476
that you go on taking the name of somebody

00:31:55.636 --> 00:32:00.676
and that deity will help you.

00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:05.756
First of all you have to become wise enough to understand

00:32:05.916 --> 00:32:11.716
that you are a part and parcel of Paramchaitanya.

00:32:11.876 --> 00:32:14.916
Everything will work out by that,

00:32:15.076 --> 00:32:18.156
and it works out so beautifully.

00:32:18.316 --> 00:32:22.036
Of course some people have hard time, I don't say they don't have.

00:32:22.196 --> 00:32:26.596
But it is not hard, because if you are one with Paramchaitanya

00:32:26.756 --> 00:32:30.076
and you know that it is doing the job, you are not feeling

00:32:30.236 --> 00:32:35.476
that hardness or sickness or anything.

00:32:35.636 --> 00:32:39.516
All the people who'll write to Me about their problems,

00:32:39.676 --> 00:32:41.396
I don't know what to say.

00:32:41.556 --> 00:32:45.156
Could just say that "Do you believe in Paramchaitanya?"

00:32:45.316 --> 00:32:50.396
All right. It knows. It knows what is to be done.

00:32:50.556 --> 00:32:54.996
It knows what is to be corrected. It knows what is to be said.

00:32:55.156 --> 00:32:59.516
See, it can create poetry, it can create music, it can create everything;

00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:03.676
but do you leave everything to the Paramchaitanya?

00:33:03.836 --> 00:33:06.236
This is the second point in wisdom:

00:33:06.396 --> 00:33:11.716
do you have wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya?

00:33:11.876 --> 00:33:14.476
After experiencing also.

00:33:14.636 --> 00:33:17.316
Like there was one lady who was going in the car

00:33:17.476 --> 00:33:23.396
and she found her car and the brakes weren't braking,

00:33:23.556 --> 00:33:27.316
and she didn't know what to do. Now if the brakes are no more,

00:33:27.476 --> 00:33:29.756
how will she manage? It was in Germany,

00:33:29.916 --> 00:33:32.476
and all the cars were moving very fast

00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:36.036
and she didn't know what to do. So she put her head

00:33:36.196 --> 00:33:43.916
on the steering wheel and she said, "I leave it to Paramchaitanya."

00:33:44.076 --> 00:33:47.476
She said, she leaves it to Me - all right, this is the same.

00:33:47.636 --> 00:33:51.716
So by saying that, what happened? She said, "Mother I don't know,

00:33:51.876 --> 00:33:55.596
when I raised my head I found my car was taken

00:33:55.756 --> 00:34:04.836
on one side of the road and nobody was there.

00:34:04.996 --> 00:34:07.076
All the cars were passing by,

00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:10.316
but somehow or other this car was taken there

00:34:10.476 --> 00:34:13.076
very nicely by some Force."

00:34:13.236 --> 00:34:18.556
So the wisdom lies in understanding the working of Paramchaitanya:

00:34:18.716 --> 00:34:22.996
how it guides you, how it helps you, how it preserves you;

00:34:23.156 --> 00:34:25.916
how, depending on Paramchaitanya,

00:34:26.076 --> 00:34:32.596
you can continue to be living very happily.

00:34:32.756 --> 00:34:37.716
I think in Sahaja Yoga we have lost very few Sahaja yogis.

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:40.996
They live for long, they don't die,

00:34:41.156 --> 00:34:45.476
and if you ask their experiences, it's very amazing

00:34:45.636 --> 00:34:48.156
how it works out.

00:34:48.316 --> 00:34:52.636
If they don't want to live also they can pass,

00:34:52.796 --> 00:34:55.876
but if they want to live, Paramchaitanya takes over

00:34:56.036 --> 00:34:57.636
and you can live long.

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:01.396
But living long doesn't mean that you go on bothering yourself

00:35:01.556 --> 00:35:04.156
as to what you will do with your money,

00:35:04.316 --> 00:35:08.236
how will you live, what will be the source.

00:35:08.396 --> 00:35:11.796
All these nonsensical things, worries, come to you, all right.

00:35:11.956 --> 00:35:18.156
Then the Paramchaitanya says, "All right, go on worrying."

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:22.156
If you go on worrying, all right go on worrying, doesn't matter.

00:35:22.316 --> 00:35:24.876
What will happen?

00:35:25.036 --> 00:35:27.396
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:35:27.556 --> 00:35:30.036
But Paramchaitanya can interfere,

00:35:30.196 --> 00:35:32.916
in case you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:35:33.076 --> 00:35:37.916
It's said many a times, "Leave it to God, leave it to God,"

00:35:38.076 --> 00:35:42.556
but "God" means ... I don't know what they mean by God.

00:35:42.716 --> 00:35:45.036
God means Paramchaitanya,

00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:51.756
God means living divine Force that is working everything.

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:54.796
So the another way of looking at it

00:35:54.956 --> 00:35:57.556
is the wisdom that we should understand,

00:35:57.716 --> 00:36:03.756
that each and every particle of this world is created by Divine,

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:05.516
by the divine Force.

00:36:05.676 --> 00:36:10.476
And this particle and everything is completely under

00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:15.476
the guidance and supervision of Paramchaitanya.

00:36:15.636 --> 00:36:20.556
Nothing can move unless until Paramchaitanya works on them.

00:36:20.716 --> 00:36:24.916
It is something so connected; globally it's so much there

00:36:25.076 --> 00:36:27.556
that people don't realize

00:36:27.716 --> 00:36:32.236
what they are doing, what they should have done.

00:36:32.396 --> 00:36:36.756
I mean on many scales you find something happening.

00:36:36.916 --> 00:36:41.756
Like supposing something is happening now in America.

00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:48.036
Just try to find out what America has done to other countries;

00:36:48.196 --> 00:36:50.636
immediately you'll get the answer.

00:36:50.796 --> 00:36:54.596
So also it takes

00:36:54.756 --> 00:36:59.756
full care of the persons who believe in Paramchaitanya,

00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:03.236
who give everything in the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:37:03.396 --> 00:37:07.756
We give things to the police, we'll give to the doctors,

00:37:07.916 --> 00:37:11.076
we give it to the some civil people,

00:37:11.236 --> 00:37:13.716
civil what you call them, engineers

00:37:13.876 --> 00:37:16.396
to do some things.

00:37:16.556 --> 00:37:25.236
But they can make mistakes; they can create problems.

00:37:25.396 --> 00:37:27.996
But you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:37:28.156 --> 00:37:32.836
It's something so remarkable that in My own life

00:37:32.996 --> 00:37:38.236
I have seen that all the time it works for Me.

00:37:38.396 --> 00:37:42.476
I was building a house in Pune

00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:47.636
and we had to put a slab - very, very big slab

00:37:47.796 --> 00:37:51.836
needed about three hundred bags of cement for that.

00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:55.436
So I got the cement and I got the people,

00:37:55.596 --> 00:37:58.516
but they said, "You're to start early in the morning

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:02.196
and you can finish next morning, twenty-four hours."

00:38:02.356 --> 00:38:07.276
I said, "All right." So at about five o'clock I told,

00:38:07.436 --> 00:38:09.676
"Let's go, the work is over."

00:38:09.836 --> 00:38:12.756
They said, "How do you know?" I said, "I know, let's go and see."

00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:16.796
So imagine, which was going to finish

00:38:16.956 --> 00:38:17.996
after twelve hours was already finished

00:38:18.156 --> 00:38:21.076
and all the workers were walking about.

00:38:21.236 --> 00:38:23.316
And everybody said, "Mother, it's a miracle.

00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:27.316
How can such a big slab be laid in such a short time?"

00:38:27.476 --> 00:38:29.996
I said, you see, to make them understand I said,

00:38:30.156 --> 00:38:33.076
"Must be Hanumana must have done the job."

00:38:33.236 --> 00:38:34.236
But all these people, all these deities

00:38:34.396 --> 00:38:38.556
are part and parcel of that Paramchaitanya.

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:41.556
Now you are worshipping the Mother.

00:38:41.716 --> 00:38:44.756
To worship the Mother is the biggest thing because

00:38:44.876 --> 00:38:49.276
all these deities and everybody are Her children,

00:38:49.436 --> 00:38:52.436
under Her command, under Her desire.

00:38:52.596 --> 00:39:01.036
So to worship the Mother, the story of as you know about Ganesha,

00:39:01.196 --> 00:39:03.316
that the Mother said that

00:39:03.476 --> 00:39:06.476
"The one who goes round the Mother Earth three times,

00:39:06.636 --> 00:39:09.676
I will give Him a present."

00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:12.236
So Shri Ganesha thought in His wisdom,

00:39:12.396 --> 00:39:15.996
"Who is greater than My Mother? No one else."

00:39:16.156 --> 00:39:18.556
Because He knew He cannot compete with His brother

00:39:18.716 --> 00:39:26.996
who has got a peacock for a conveyance.

00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:34.716
So He said, "How can I go round and win over this person?"

00:39:34.876 --> 00:39:39.036
So best is to take to wisdom.

00:39:39.196 --> 00:39:43.756
"My Mother is greater than everything else."

00:39:43.876 --> 00:39:47.556
So He went around His Mother three times and He got the prize,

00:39:47.716 --> 00:39:51.116
and the other brother was just still moving on.

00:39:51.276 --> 00:39:55.476
When He came back He found that the present is already lost.

00:39:55.636 --> 00:40:01.796
So again and again I'll say it is the wisdom that helps you,

00:40:01.956 --> 00:40:06.116
the wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya.

00:40:06.276 --> 00:40:08.876
And this is something,

00:40:09.036 --> 00:40:12.236
for a modern person, very difficult to understand.

00:40:12.396 --> 00:40:14.676
He can't calculate two plus two.

00:40:14.836 --> 00:40:19.556
He's so bad because of this computers and things like that,

00:40:19.716 --> 00:40:22.276
is absolutely hopeless

00:40:22.436 --> 00:40:30.516
as far as any mathematical calculations are needed or...

00:40:30.676 --> 00:40:32.956
Now I am, I must say,

00:40:33.116 --> 00:40:37.156
I don't know how to handle any computer or any calculator;

00:40:37.316 --> 00:40:41.756
but if you ask Me just like that, "Mother, how much will it be?"

00:40:41.916 --> 00:40:47.916
I'll say so much, and it will be that. It will be that.

00:40:48.076 --> 00:40:53.756
But I am so sure about it, it cannot be anything else but that,

00:40:53.916 --> 00:40:55.716
and it works that way.

00:40:55.876 --> 00:41:02.276
Sometimes of course, if I want to tell some wrong thing

00:41:02.436 --> 00:41:04.396
just to mislead the person

00:41:04.556 --> 00:41:08.716
then I may say something, but normally I know it is that.

00:41:08.876 --> 00:41:12.796
But I know not like the way we know;

00:41:12.956 --> 00:41:16.316
I just know it, that's what it is, just know it.

00:41:16.475 --> 00:41:23.995
So I am not saying that you develop your knowledge to that extent

00:41:24.156 --> 00:41:27.196
that you can do it, but your wisdom.

00:41:27.356 --> 00:41:31.276
If you start using your wisdom, it will always come handy.

00:41:31.436 --> 00:41:36.236
In anything that you do, think of the wisdom.

00:41:36.396 --> 00:41:40.596
My advice to you is

00:41:40.756 --> 00:41:46.916
that as your Mother loves the whole world, loves all of you,

00:41:47.076 --> 00:41:50.996
and cares for those who haven't even got realization,

00:41:51.156 --> 00:41:57.236
you should also strive to create more people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:57.396 --> 00:42:01.076
But in that if you start behaving in a manner all the time saying,

00:42:01.236 --> 00:42:05.076
"You are catching this, you are a bhoot, you are this, you are that."

00:42:05.236 --> 00:42:11.076
I never said that to anyone, so you shouldn't say like that.

00:42:11.236 --> 00:42:14.356
That's no love, that's no understanding.

00:42:14.516 --> 00:42:19.116
The understanding is that you were just the same as the person was

00:42:19.316 --> 00:42:21.316
and now you are knowledgeable,

00:42:21.476 --> 00:42:25.316
so you must use your knowledge to correct that person,

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:28.676
not to put him down.

00:42:28.836 --> 00:42:32.076
And that correction is also not verbal;

00:42:32.236 --> 00:42:36.756
it's just through your vibrations you can correct the other person.

00:42:36.876 --> 00:42:41.316
Most of the Sahaja Yoga work sometimes I've seen that it stops

00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:45.836
because we are very methodical, we become like great teachers,

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:51.596
we start telling them stories, and then they get fed up with you.

00:42:53.236 --> 00:42:56.396
So when you are handling other people, as I said,

00:42:56.556 --> 00:42:59.156
we have to spread the knowledge, very important,

00:42:59.316 --> 00:43:01.556
we cannot keep it to ourselves.

00:43:01.716 --> 00:43:05.356
But it's not for any ambition, for any leadership,

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.236
for any kind of recognition;

00:43:07.396 --> 00:43:13.836
but just the use of our wisdom, use of our knowledge

00:43:13.996 --> 00:43:17.716
that we want to help others out of love.

00:43:17.876 --> 00:43:21.636
Not for any recognition, not for any position, nothing.

00:43:21.796 --> 00:43:24.916
Just we want to do it because we love them.

00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:30.756
And I am sure this will work out very effectively.

00:43:30.916 --> 00:43:34.916
And the person who will be helped, or the persons who will be helped

00:43:35.076 --> 00:43:38.316
will be just, be bound to you

00:43:38.476 --> 00:43:41.236
because they find the true knowledge.

00:43:41.396 --> 00:43:43.316
But supposing somebody comes to you and says

00:43:43.476 --> 00:43:45.316
"I know the true knowledge."

00:43:45.476 --> 00:43:52.396
You say, "You might be knowing, but I have to know what you know."

00:43:52.556 --> 00:43:56.596
Then you ask that person; then he'll give you a big lecture.

00:43:56.756 --> 00:43:58.676
You should say, "No, that's not the thing."

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:01.236
Just smile. Say, "That's not the thing."

00:44:01.396 --> 00:44:09.036
The thing is, true knowledge is a part and parcel of your being.

00:44:10.156 --> 00:44:17.796
It's just within you. It is not some sort of a concrete stuff

00:44:17.956 --> 00:44:19.956
that you have read or you have understood,

00:44:20.116 --> 00:44:24.156
but it just has become a light within you,

00:44:24.316 --> 00:44:29.476
and that light is there. It has no ...

00:44:29.636 --> 00:44:33.396
it's no necessity for you to be very well educated,

00:44:33.556 --> 00:44:35.076
or to be very intelligent,

00:44:35.236 --> 00:44:38.436
or to be very highly placed, not necessary.

00:44:38.596 --> 00:44:44.316
It is how your heart is clean.

00:44:44.476 --> 00:44:46.556
In the heart it resides.

00:44:46.716 --> 00:44:49.476
Imagine, all other knowledge resides in the brain,

00:44:49.636 --> 00:44:53.996
while the pure knowledge resides in the heart. Very surprising.

00:44:54.156 --> 00:45:00.316
But we do not know also that actually our heart rules the head.

00:45:00.476 --> 00:45:06.196
There are seven auras around the heart which control the brain

00:45:06.356 --> 00:45:11.756
in such a manner that we act in the hands of the Paramchaitanya.

00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:14.996
Unless and until your heart is clean,

00:45:15.156 --> 00:45:20.396
unless and until in your heart you have a beautiful image

00:45:20.556 --> 00:45:31.116
of a person who is very, very pure,

00:45:31.276 --> 00:45:36.316
you cannot, you cannot do anything mentally.

00:45:36.476 --> 00:45:40.156
And from your heart if you have to do, your heart has to be

00:45:40.316 --> 00:45:44.156
very clean and extremely wise.

00:45:44.316 --> 00:45:49.716
This is the point one has to jump into: that your heart, is it wise?

00:45:49.876 --> 00:45:53.836
For example, to get attached to someone too much,

00:45:53.996 --> 00:45:58.396
identified with some much shows that your heart is not clean.

00:45:58.556 --> 00:46:01.716
It has so many bondages.

00:46:01.876 --> 00:46:05.116
Open your heart, fully.

00:46:05.276 --> 00:46:10.636
And that's why they say that the Goddess resides in the Heart,

00:46:10.796 --> 00:46:12.876
in the center Heart.

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:17.996
She resides in the center Heart because She's so balanced.

00:46:18.156 --> 00:46:21.556
She resides in the center Heart as Shakti,

00:46:21.716 --> 00:46:26.876
and She gives you all that you want.

00:46:27.036 --> 00:46:30.716
Within you She's settled down as many things.

00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:32.836
You know the Shlokas which says

00:46:32.996 --> 00:46:38.636
that She's settled within us like knowledge,

00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:42.076
She's settled within us as memory,

00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:44.716
She is settled within us as sleep,

00:46:44.876 --> 00:46:50.796
also She's settled within us as illusion, bhranti.

00:46:50.956 --> 00:46:53.476
She's the one who puts us into illusions

00:46:53.636 --> 00:46:58.836
because we are not yet fully perfected.

00:46:58.996 --> 00:47:11.996
We have to become paripakwa - means absolutely, absolutely matured.

00:47:12.156 --> 00:47:16.916
Till we are matured this Mother Herself puts you into illusions

00:47:17.076 --> 00:47:20.996
and plays around, so that you learn how to be wise.

00:47:21.156 --> 00:47:24.196
So one should understand that She's playing around with you.

00:47:24.356 --> 00:47:27.276
And you should try to be very careful

00:47:27.436 --> 00:47:31.356
and not to be falling into Her maya,

00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:33.556
because if She puts you in the maya,

00:47:33.716 --> 00:47:37.196
you'll go round and round and you will reach nowhere.

00:47:37.356 --> 00:47:41.916
So this power of bhranti is also very important,

00:47:42.076 --> 00:47:47.036
this delusion you can call it, or else you can call it

00:47:47.196 --> 00:47:49.756
a thing by which She creates a drama,

00:47:49.916 --> 00:47:57.676
in which you become like a stupid man being found out.

00:47:57.836 --> 00:48:01.596
So this stupidity and all that

00:48:01.756 --> 00:48:06.916
can be removed by this bhranti that She creates.

00:48:07.076 --> 00:48:13.076
And this power of bhranti is because of human beings as they are,

00:48:13.236 --> 00:48:17.396
because they will not understand something straightforward;

00:48:17.556 --> 00:48:19.396
so it has to go round and round,

00:48:19.556 --> 00:48:21.156
till they reach a point to understand

00:48:21.316 --> 00:48:24.196
that it was the play of the Mother

00:48:24.356 --> 00:48:28.916
that brought them to this shore of wisdom.

00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:33.436
So for us it is important to see that

00:48:33.596 --> 00:48:37.996
so much has been done by Paramchaitanya for us,

00:48:38.156 --> 00:48:40.596
the Mother has done so much for us.

00:48:40.756 --> 00:48:44.756
Now what are we going to do ourselves

00:48:44.876 --> 00:48:48.396
to get all these powers that She has given us,

00:48:48.556 --> 00:48:52.116
to be completely enlightened and developed?

00:48:52.276 --> 00:48:54.556
What have we done so far?

00:48:54.716 --> 00:49:07.236
Nothing to be done as such but to develop a kind of a deep devotion,

00:49:07.396 --> 00:49:13.876
deep understanding; and that depth is possible, absolutely possible,

00:49:14.036 --> 00:49:19.156
because now you are on your way to that perfection.

00:49:19.316 --> 00:49:22.756
So today in Cabella is the last puja,

00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:26.276
and I want to tell you as a Mother

00:49:26.436 --> 00:49:30.876
that you all should depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:49:31.076 --> 00:49:35.036
That's very important, to depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:49:35.196 --> 00:49:38.476
Also there's a habit of many people

00:49:38.636 --> 00:49:40.756
to put the blame on others, like,

00:49:40.916 --> 00:49:45.276
"I got caught up from this person and got caught up from that person."

00:49:45.436 --> 00:49:53.116
You are caught up by yourself only. All such ideas are of no use.

00:49:53.276 --> 00:49:54.596
Face yourself,

00:49:54.756 --> 00:49:56.316
find out about yourself,

00:49:56.476 --> 00:50:00.196
and you have to perfect yourself. That's so important,

00:50:00.356 --> 00:50:03.276
because at this juncture of the time

00:50:03.436 --> 00:50:06.596
people think that something great is going to happen.

00:50:06.756 --> 00:50:08.316
I don't know.

00:50:08.476 --> 00:50:12.236
Two thousand years according to them would be something great,

00:50:12.396 --> 00:50:15.556
but I don't know, because is all man-made,

00:50:15.716 --> 00:50:19.396
all this two thousand year and three thousand year is man-made.

00:50:19.556 --> 00:50:25.516
But I Myself feel, as predicted by many, that possibly

00:50:25.676 --> 00:50:30.196
because of your understanding and your wisdom

00:50:30.356 --> 00:50:33.996
I'm sure something great may happen in this world,

00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:38.636
and things may be brought to a proper level

00:50:38.796 --> 00:50:41.196
of understanding of spirituality.

00:50:41.356 --> 00:50:44.996
Because this is the Last Judgment, and in this Last Judgment

00:50:45.156 --> 00:50:50.396
you have to play a very vital role, which I am sure you can do it,

00:50:50.556 --> 00:50:55.716
if you decide to achieve something for the future.

00:50:55.716 --> 00:50:58.676
May God bless you.
