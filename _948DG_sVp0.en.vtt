00:00:02.587 --> 00:00:06.856
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:08.756
and everybody has said

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:12.865
that, "Mother please tell us about Shri Rama".

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:19.390
As you know that Shri Rama has taken

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:23.009
a very important place in our chakras.

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:28.350
He is seated on our right heart.

00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:33.741
Shri Rama

00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:40.218
represents the place of the father (right heart),

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:46.444
so lack of father's responsibility

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.371
or father's love

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:55.039
can cause a catch of this chakra.

00:00:57.464 --> 00:01:02.513
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand that Rama

00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:08.774
and all other Gods

00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:15.407
came on earth as different manifestations of divine energy (shakti);

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.430
they came to do their jobs.

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.942
In that sense Shri Rama has a special job.

00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:30.729
Like Socrates has said benevolent king has to come.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.212
As a reflection of that Shri Rama came.

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:41.350
Shri Rama came in complete human form

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:46.425
He even forgot that he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:49.390
He was made to forget this.

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:53.577
However for the world

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.688
He was Purushottam (Ideal human being).

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:06.867
You all must have heard of his qualities and his childhood

00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:14.651
In Sahaja yoga we should understand

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.975
that when we worship any of the Gods,

00:02:20.252 --> 00:02:24.616
when we consider them as our ideal,

00:02:24.807 --> 00:02:29.806
then which qualities we can gain from them,

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.340
which qualities we have received?

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:36.918
Shri Rama has many noble qualities.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.843
One quality was that He was Purushotam (ideal),

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:47.783
another was how He ruled as a king.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.030
He kept his people's opinions higher than Himself,

00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:58.052
higher than his wife and children.

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:02.472
In the present time,

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:10.703
if people and politicians understand this point,

00:03:10.904 --> 00:03:14.932
they wouldn't be called as selfish,

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:17.130
they wouldn't be selfish,

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:19.650
they would be followers of Dharma.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:28.209
However, none has tried to adopt Shri Rama as a role model till now.

00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:31.723
On the other hand, they will sing His bhajans

00:03:31.924 --> 00:03:39.302
or in his name build large organisations and temples.

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:44.380
By doing all this, has Shri Rama come in the hearts of these people?

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:48.120
Can you get His light in your life?

00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:50.269
Only Sahaja Yogis can do this

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.058
that is to bring the light of Shri Rama into their attention.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.306
He is totally without any attachments.

00:04:02.507 --> 00:04:07.063
As it is, all the deities are free from sins and punyas(good deeds),

00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:10.614
Whatever we deem as a sin

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:13.281
if they do, is not a sin.

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:16.571
For example, Shri Krishna killed many people,

00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:19.394
Shri Rama killed Ravana.

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:25.869
It can be considered a sin in worldly sense

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.394
but not in the eyes of God.

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:34.437
Because they destroy evil people and remove evils

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.311
and they have the right to do whatever is needed for this purpose.

00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:46.433
Like when Shri Devi slayed rakshasas, She killed the demons.

00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:49.338
Some people may ask if She has committed a sin.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.288
However Her responsibility is to destroy the rakshasas

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:59.146
and protect the saints.

00:05:01.765 --> 00:05:07.767
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's redemption is the most important event.

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:10.354
He reedemed Ahilya.

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:14.752
She was cursed by her husband.

00:05:15.238 --> 00:05:20.009
In those times if any women goes out of dharma,

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.336
and if her husband was a saint of high stature,

00:05:24.537 --> 00:05:26.933
he could curse her.

00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:32.047
But Ahillya was blamed falsely.

00:05:32.277 --> 00:05:34.822
and false allegations were made.

00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:37.784
And she was made into stone.

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:42.325
So Shri Rama saved Ahilya.

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:49.994
Particularly His attitude towards His wife,

00:05:51.042 --> 00:05:53.743
His love for Her,

00:05:53.944 --> 00:05:59.390
His commitment to having only one wife

00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:02.716
is something to be really understood.

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:07.028
Even though He knew that Sitaji was the incarnation of Shri Mahalaxmi

00:06:07.227 --> 00:06:09.161
She Herself was a Devi.

00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:12.030
But in His human form

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:18.221
He never raised His eyes to look at any other women but his wife.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.944
When we talk about Shri Rama

00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:27.006
the husband like qualities inside us should be pure.

00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:31.860
When any lady thinks about Shri Rama

00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:35.991
she should have the same faith in her husband

00:06:36.198 --> 00:06:38.973
like Shri Sita had in Her husband.

00:06:39.174 --> 00:06:42.791
Similarly, husbands also need to adopt the quality of Shri Rama

00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:45.376
of being devoted to their one wife.

00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:48.055
This is not difficult for Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:53.008
Women should be respected. Have respect for your wife!

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:56.938
Although Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.599
Shri Rama felt it is His duty to rescue Her.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.651
But in His kingdom it was His duty to follow the will of the people

00:07:06.842 --> 00:07:08.643
and He had so much balance

00:07:08.844 --> 00:07:13.474
that Shri Sita only for whom He woeked hard to rescue

00:07:13.675 --> 00:07:16.697
He left Her because of the will of the people.

00:07:16.898 --> 00:07:19.210
As Sitaji Herself was the Goddess,

00:07:19.417 --> 00:07:22.768
this had no particular impact on Her,

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:24.847
it had no consequence.

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:26.819
So Shri Rama sacrificied Her.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.329
People talk about such things which are not in public interest.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.488
Being their ideal, He did not want them to think that He condoned

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:43.933
keeping the company of women whose character is under doubt.

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.852
Although She was the unblemishable Devi (Nishkalanka),

00:07:47.053 --> 00:07:49.778
She was the embodiment of the purity of the Devi,

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:54.570
when He left Her, in one way She left Him too.

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:58.220
She left Him in a manner a woman would do

00:07:58.403 --> 00:08:00.915
and Shri Rama as a man would do.

00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:03.599
Sitaji disappeared into the Mother Earth

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:09.167
and then in the end Shri Rama went into River Sarayu.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:16.318
Their life was very eventful and full of miracles.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.656
In their whole life you can see how Shri Sita and Shri Rama

00:08:19.847 --> 00:08:25.736
had respect and were faithful to each other.

00:08:25.937 --> 00:08:28.683
Even though Shri Rama left Shri Sita,

00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:31.895
She understood that it was His royal duty,

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:36.121
and She never complained or talked ill of Him.

00:08:36.323 --> 00:08:41.260
And effortlessly She raised Her children,

00:08:41.462 --> 00:08:44.668
and made them flourish and develop.

00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:50.632
Shri Rama's two children are called Luv and Kush.

00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:54.478
They came like devotees

00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:59.784
and in this world we can see them as the ideal disciples.

00:08:59.985 --> 00:09:01.581
They represent the disciple principle

00:09:01.782 --> 00:09:07.403
and for us they are the power of disciplehood

00:09:07.745 --> 00:09:10.682
with which we can become disciple of someone.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:16.800
As disciples they learned archery at a very young age.

00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:20.398
In their young age they learned Ramayana

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:24.579
and got proficiency in music.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:32.115
It means that the disciples must surrender completely to their guru.

00:09:32.316 --> 00:09:36.741
We also have the qualities of a disciple innately within us.

00:09:36.942 --> 00:09:44.464
They were completely surrendered to their Mother, who was Shakti.

00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:50.110
Even they were about to fight against Shri Rama for their Mother,

00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:53.721
so they kept their Mother as the highest in the world.

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:56.662
The Mother also cared for them,

00:09:56.863 --> 00:10:00.015
nurtured them and made them stand on dharma.

00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:03.270
To make them progress was Her foremost priority and duty.

00:10:03.471 --> 00:10:05.860
Not like today's wives who would have cried:

00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:08.320
"My husband left me, my husband has left me".

00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:11.579
But when they get a husband they will fight all the time

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.417
and when the husband leaves them then they will cry.

00:10:14.618 --> 00:10:17.001
Unlike Sitaji who felt: "If He has left Me, no problem.

00:10:17.202 --> 00:10:20.012
These are My children, I will take care of them.

00:10:20.195 --> 00:10:28.056
And nothing should happen that deprive them of anything".

00:10:28.257 --> 00:10:34.317
Shri Sita's bravery and fortitude

00:10:34.518 --> 00:10:37.849
were the special qualities seen in Her life.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.744
Every lady must imbibe these qualities.

00:10:40.945 --> 00:10:43.527
Even if you are separated from your husband

00:10:43.728 --> 00:10:45.829
and you are not longer together,

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.408
even then, because of your husband,

00:10:49.595 --> 00:10:53.732
you should not let that create a loss for you or your children.

00:10:53.933 --> 00:10:59.353
Because your duty is the most important thing.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.276
You should not give up this most important thing.

00:11:02.477 --> 00:11:09.455
All Sahaja Yoginis should try to get this power of Shakti.

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:14.088
Shri Rama's life was also very pure and spotless (nirmal)

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:18.439
and He gave up everything for His wife.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:24.074
When his wife was exiled to the forest,

00:11:24.281 --> 00:11:26.289
and He had to live alone,

00:11:26.488 --> 00:11:30.032
and when He sacrificed Her,

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:34.303
He gave up all the comforts of the royal life.

00:11:34.504 --> 00:11:39.126
You know He used to sleep on the grass, on the floor

00:11:39.327 --> 00:11:45.156
walked barefeet and wore clothes like an ascetic.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.850
All these are not stories This is the truth,

00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:53.205
In our world, in India, many people were born

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.030
whose life had a high standard of morals

00:11:57.231 --> 00:12:00.774
and they never thought about small or low level things.

00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:04.202
But all these ideal people of our country

00:12:04.403 --> 00:12:09.770
have become superfluous over time.

00:12:10.134 --> 00:12:13.664
We think that Shri Rama is ours, we are His devotees

00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:16.564
and we can attain Him by only singing bhajans to Him.

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:19.980
We have developed a kind of hypocrisy.

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:23.727
In other countries where they do not have such models (like Shri Rama)

00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:27.232
the people there try to correct themselves.

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:29.142
They try to make themselves ok.

00:12:29.343 --> 00:12:31.557
Because you have a model like Shri Ram

00:12:31.748 --> 00:12:33.850
you say you can never become like Him,

00:12:34.051 --> 00:12:36.508
or like Shri Krishna.

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:38.274
We feel they became models,

00:12:38.473 --> 00:12:40.589
but we are not able to relate with Them.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.919
We get feelings like that.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.824
But if we have Shri Rama inside,

00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:49.517
His light can certainly come in our attention.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.016
Why cannot it come? Why should we not attain this?

00:12:53.217 --> 00:12:56.615
Why should we not try to learn about the circumstances

00:12:56.822 --> 00:12:59.450
around which Shri Rama came on this earth?

00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:02.199
A Sahaja Yogi must consider this -

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.697
if we can attain Shri Rama's spiritual state,

00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:07.866
then all our political problems will be resolved,

00:13:08.049 --> 00:13:12.032
all our problems will be over.

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:15.026
This will happen the day Sahay Yogis resolve in their heart

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:17.294
that they would like to become like Shri Rama.

00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:20.985
In our country, where Shri Ram ruled,

00:13:21.216 --> 00:13:25.491
He conducted His rule in a selfless state

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:32.206
and in a state of enlightment.

00:13:32.774 --> 00:13:36.226
And He desired all good qualities should come in His people.

00:13:36.427 --> 00:13:38.834
And He wanted that firstly His people to become dharmic,

00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:42.268
get educated and evolved.

00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:47.639
He wanted many high ideals should be established in them.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.433
This He tried to do all the time.

00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:54.893
And for this He made His life very idealistic (for others to follow).

00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:59.421
Just think, if someone tells you something

00:13:59.622 --> 00:14:01.706
but he himself does not follow his own advise

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:04.669
then how can you have faith in such a person?

00:14:04.876 --> 00:14:06.857
Therefore you cannot get the qualities.

00:14:07.058 --> 00:14:10.790
However, many people say, "We follow this person or that person".

00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:13.760
But in reality, they are just the opposite of whom they follow.

00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:17.763
Followers of Ram seems to be the most corrupt politicians possible?

00:14:17.964 --> 00:14:19.638
or they have more than ten wives.

00:14:19.837 --> 00:14:22.899
How can they say they follow Shri Rama?

00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:28.926
What is the duty of a Sahaja Yogi in his life?

00:14:29.127 --> 00:14:34.199
We also have to bring the light of the Gods in our attention.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:40.179
For every situation we must think: "What would Shri Rama have done?"

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.387
If such a question arose then what woud Shri Rama have replied.

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:48.207
If such a question arose then what woud Shri Sita have replied.

00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:50.479
What would Sita ji say?

00:14:50.654 --> 00:14:52.699
How would Shri Sita behave?

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.603
If any lady thinks like that

00:14:54.804 --> 00:14:57.839
she would certainly become the Gruhlaxmi of her house.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.837
As you Sahaja Yogis know, Sitaji took many births after that.

00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:09.260
And She came as incarnation of Gruhlaxmi as Fatima-bi.

00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:12.087
She used to stay at home under a veil,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.334
but all dharma was done by Her power.

00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:20.408
Not necessary for you to go out and give big lectures

00:15:20.599 --> 00:15:22.845
or become a leader. There is no need.

00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:26.665
You can do this work from home,

00:15:26.866 --> 00:15:34.801
you can spread Sahaja Yoga to your children, relatives and friends.

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:37.536
But at first you should attain this (Sahaja Yoga).

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:41.708
After all this work is done, you can spread it to society.

00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:45.236
After that you can go elsewhere to spread it, if you want.

00:15:45.437 --> 00:15:52.149
But first ladies should have pure character like Sitaji.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.409
First reflection of this purity is a strong maternal feeling of love.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.629
When She was exiled in the jungle along with Her husband

00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:03.691
She never complained that, "My husband doesn't earn, He doesn't earn.

00:16:03.892 --> 00:16:05.688
Just like the women here complain,

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:08.383
"He doesn't do this, he doesn't buy this or that".

00:16:08.584 --> 00:16:10.889
If he is in jungle, then so am I.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.436
Whatever he will eat, I will also eat.

00:16:13.637 --> 00:16:15.843
Will I eat before he eats?

00:16:16.026 --> 00:16:17.619
Shri Sita would not have done that.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.526
Let me serve him first and then the brother in law, let them finish

00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:22.896
then I will eat.

00:16:23.097 --> 00:16:27.449
Nowadays women think there is too much...

00:16:29.505 --> 00:16:35.520
there is too much pressure of the work on them.

00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:37.149
But it is not so.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.243
A woman is like earth element.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.965
She has so much power that she can absorb a lot of pressure.

00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:48.898
So much is being given by the earth: flowers, fruit, leaves etc.

00:16:49.099 --> 00:16:52.912
In the same manner, women are like the earth element.

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:58.702
We have got so many powers that we can absorb everything inside.

00:16:58.903 --> 00:17:02.542
and shower the rain of love which is inside us.

00:17:02.743 --> 00:17:04.964
God has given us this power.

00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:07.295
So if you have this power -

00:17:07.496 --> 00:17:11.248
for example if this fan is moving, it is due to the electricity.

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:15.280
Then which one is greater, the electricity or the fan?

00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:21.220
If you think the fan is greater because it is moving

00:17:21.403 --> 00:17:23.329
then you are under an illusion.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.585
The manifestation of feminine energy is huge, like an ocean.

00:17:27.786 --> 00:17:32.550
With that support men do their work.

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:35.839
This is like potential and kinetic states of energy.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.908
So women are the potential energy and men are the kinetic energy.

00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:43.473
But wanting to emulate men, because they can run faster.

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.205
women also start running.

00:17:45.406 --> 00:17:48.512
There is no need for a woman to do that. She needs to sit.

00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:52.308
Roles of both are different

00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:55.289
so each of them need to play their role in solving a problem.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.529
Actually, women can thrive in both activities (potential and kinetic).

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.695
When the time comes women can be more productive than men.

00:18:02.896 --> 00:18:06.165
As you may be aware, in Maharashtra there was a widow named Tarabai

00:18:06.366 --> 00:18:09.230
who was 17 years, 17 years only.

00:18:09.431 --> 00:18:13.648
She was the younger daughter-in-law of Shivaji

00:18:13.849 --> 00:18:18.103
All lost against Aurangzeb and she defeated him at only 17 years.

00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:21.175
and built his grave in a place called Aurangabad.

00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:22.835
You can understand today

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:28.114
that if a woman is able to concentrate all her powers.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:32.578
Like it is said that when her powers are in a manifested state,

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.988
then she can become fierce (prachand).

00:18:35.189 --> 00:18:41.727
But if she wastes or fritters away her powers

00:18:41.928 --> 00:18:47.290
by wasting it in fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things,

00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:50.340
then her power is completely destroyed.

00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:53.770
Women are so powerful

00:18:53.969 --> 00:18:58.708
that if they want, they can work more than men.

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:02.192
However, first of all, they must respect their powers.

00:19:02.393 --> 00:19:06.303
By throwing her powers here and there, by destroying her powers,

00:19:06.494 --> 00:19:08.396
she becomes powerless.

00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:11.192
These powerless women are of no use to anyone.

00:19:11.393 --> 00:19:13.829
Therefore, the woman's role

00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:16.442
is of utmost importance and full of dignity.

00:19:16.643 --> 00:19:23.147
Women should therefore be very modest and very wise.

00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:27.795
For example, sometimes men use swear words but real women do not.

00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:31.765
You might have seen that men argue and can even have physical fights.

00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:34.639
Let them! But women do not do that.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.989
Their job is to emit peace,

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:39.545
their job is to give protection

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:42.769
and their job is to save everyone.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.354
For example, there is a shield.

00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:47.700
A shield cannot function as a sword

00:19:47.901 --> 00:19:50.103
and a sword cannot function as a shield.

00:19:50.304 --> 00:19:53.464
So is the shield more important or the sword?

00:19:53.647 --> 00:19:57.151
Obviously the shield, as it can withstand the attack of the sword.

00:19:57.352 --> 00:20:00.210
Sometimes the sword may even break but not the shield.

00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:03.968
So women must be engulfed in their power.

00:20:04.143 --> 00:20:07.217
And the main lever for manifesting this strength

00:20:07.408 --> 00:20:09.969
is the power of humility.

00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:14.220
With humility we should establish these powers within us.

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:16.827
This work is not difficult for Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:17.018 --> 00:20:19.200
For Sahaja Yogis this is not difficult at all.

00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:23.195
I see many Sahaja Yoginis talking so much nonsense.

00:20:23.396 --> 00:20:26.887
I don't know why, but anywhere they want to chat non-stop with men.

00:20:27.088 --> 00:20:29.180
Once a gentleman came running to Me and said, "Mother save me, save me!"

00:20:29.381 --> 00:20:30.888
I asked ”What happened?”, He said "She is after me".

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:32.940
I asked, ”Who?”, "The one who talks a lot."

00:20:33.141 --> 00:20:34.662
I said, ”The one who talks a lot?”.

00:20:34.863 --> 00:20:36.723
He said, "Yes, save me, I am fed up with her".

00:20:36.924 --> 00:20:38.648
So he came to hide in My room.

00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:41.949
There is no need to excessively talk with men.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.234
What is the need to talk nonsense?

00:20:44.435 --> 00:20:47.555
Amongst women also, no need to talk about unimportant things.

00:20:47.756 --> 00:20:51.523
In Sahaja Yoga, I have seen that men make more effort to study.

00:20:51.739 --> 00:20:53.123
Women should also do that,

00:20:53.324 --> 00:20:55.475
what is Sahaja Yoga and what chakras there are,

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.049
which chakra have what impact,

00:20:58.255 --> 00:21:01.718
which chakra causes which problem.

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:03.652
They should have full knowledge of this.

00:21:03.853 --> 00:21:06.843
If only men learn this knowledge, then women will be left behind.

00:21:07.044 --> 00:21:09.300
Women must learn all this.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:14.779
Now for men, Shri Rama is their role model.

00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:21.398
I feel in a way, Muslims have played a good role for us.

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:24.931
I do not criticize them. This problem is not in their country.

00:21:25.132 --> 00:21:26.882
Say if you go to Riyad,

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:29.905
no Muslim will stare at you.

00:21:30.136 --> 00:21:31.736
I have not seem anyone doing that.

00:21:31.937 --> 00:21:33.962
If there is a lady, they will give her respect.

00:21:34.129 --> 00:21:36.069
If any lady is crossing the street,

00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:38.154
they will stop the car out of respect.

00:21:38.355 --> 00:21:40.288
There is so much respect for women there.

00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:43.228
But here in India, I do not understand why,

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:45.736
the impact of the muslim culture has been the opposite.

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:49.816
that we see women as an object to be exploited.

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.766
They want to see every woman in their path,

00:21:51.967 --> 00:21:54.859
twisting the neck but continue staring.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.423
It is a big sin to stare at every woman.

00:21:59.828 --> 00:22:02.057
In Sahaja Yoga, it is considered as an prohibited act.

00:22:02.225 --> 00:22:03.574
Absolutely prohibited.

00:22:03.775 --> 00:22:05.943
Firstly you will spoil your eyes.

00:22:06.126 --> 00:22:08.661
And being in Sahaja Yoga it will cause even more damage.

00:22:08.862 --> 00:22:13.216
If more damage does not happen, then you may even become blind.

00:22:13.748 --> 00:22:17.666
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes.

00:22:17.867 --> 00:22:20.524
They are talking to someone but eyes are wandering elsewhere.

00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:22.616
Nowadays, even women too are learning this.

00:22:22.817 --> 00:22:27.210
The biggest loss by doing this is your attention.

00:22:27.591 --> 00:22:30.670
If your attention goes here and there,

00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:32.857
if your attention goes here and there,

00:22:33.032 --> 00:22:35.179
then what's the use of Self-Realization?

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.826
Because without focussing attention

00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:41.404
it can't become active.

00:22:41.605 --> 00:22:44.098
Focussed attention can only become active.

00:22:44.281 --> 00:22:46.524
A focussed attention must be attained.

00:22:46.725 --> 00:22:49.137
In the west, this disease is more among men.

00:22:49.338 --> 00:22:51.589
It's there in women also but not as much as in the men.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.103
So the western yogis asked me the cure for this disease.

00:22:54.304 --> 00:22:57.238
They are not like Indians, they do not think this is good thing.

00:22:57.439 --> 00:22:58.829
They consider it a negative thing.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.561
Since they came to Sahaj Yoga, they are asking Me to remove it.

00:23:01.762 --> 00:23:05.615
I told them to look only at the ground

00:23:05.798 --> 00:23:08.441
and up to 3 feet on top.

00:23:08.642 --> 00:23:10.849
You have no need to see above that.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.735
Look at the ground while walking.

00:23:12.936 --> 00:23:16.710
So you will recognise Sahaja Yogis anywhere in the world.

00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:19.205
They are the ones walking with their eyes lowered.

00:23:19.406 --> 00:23:24.696
You see all good things below 3 feet, such as flowers and children.

00:23:24.898 --> 00:23:27.502
Nothing good to see above.

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:32.920
So, that's how you should control your attention.

00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.092
Now Shri Rama did not need to do this.

00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:38.756
However, if you have respect towards Shri Rama,

00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:43.505
you must control your attention like Him.

00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:48.849
Explain to your wife,

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.540
that she is a shakti and you respect that quality.

00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:54.986
But she must also prove herself worthy of this respect.

00:23:55.187 --> 00:23:59.192
Like the shloka: "Yatra nāryastu pūjyanté ramanté tatra devatāḥ" -

00:23:59.393 --> 00:24:03.932
"Where women are worshipped, in such places do Gods reside."

00:24:04.139 --> 00:24:07.978
But those women must also be worth respecting.

00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.788
[to audience] What is it? Please sit down.

00:24:14.235 --> 00:24:18.307
Ok, sit down. One should not move around during the Puja.

00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:22.154
So if the woman is to be worshipped,

00:24:22.355 --> 00:24:24.598
she needs to be worthy of worship.

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:27.126
Who would worship a dirty woman?

00:24:27.317 --> 00:24:29.735
Who would worship a cruel woman?

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:32.669
Or someone with a demonic temperament? Will anyone worship?

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.386
Only those who are worth of worship

00:24:35.589 --> 00:24:37.982
should be worshipped

00:24:38.183 --> 00:24:40.281
and only in that place God would reside as well.

00:24:40.482 --> 00:24:42.352
Firstly, men should realise

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.818
that this lady is the mother of their children.

00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:50.088
If husband scolds or mocks his wife in front of children,

00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:52.035
gives her no respect,

00:24:52.226 --> 00:24:54.564
then children will never respect their mother.

00:24:54.765 --> 00:24:56.505
Think of it as a relationship

00:24:56.706 --> 00:24:59.054
between a prime minister and a deputy prime minister.

00:24:59.255 --> 00:25:01.811
Women should not insult their husbands as well.

00:25:02.012 --> 00:25:05.539
Like the delegation of authority from prime minister (father)

00:25:05.746 --> 00:25:07.229
to deputy (mother),

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.789
it can be wrongly delegated to children by the father.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.993
But if the couple are such that they do not have this subtlety,

00:25:15.194 --> 00:25:18.310
then the lady feels she should dominate, the man feels he should.

00:25:18.511 --> 00:25:21.076
If woman understand how to handle her man,

00:25:21.277 --> 00:25:22.986
then there would not be any fights.

00:25:23.187 --> 00:25:26.610
You should understand that it's very easy to manage men,

00:25:26.811 --> 00:25:28.995
because they are like children.

00:25:29.196 --> 00:25:31.411
Its very easy to manage them.

00:25:31.612 --> 00:25:34.660
Their temperament is simple, like that of children.

00:25:34.861 --> 00:25:38.245
With arguments or by talking a lot, you can't handle them.

00:25:38.446 --> 00:25:41.757
You must also forgive them like you forgive children.

00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:45.323
They go outside, have fights or arguments and return home stressed.

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:47.269
And then carry this frustration home to the wife.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.304
If they express it outside they will get beaten.

00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:51.993
So the wife can sometimes ignore these outbursts.

00:25:52.194 --> 00:25:57.141
Until the wife has this attitude towards her husband,

00:25:57.342 --> 00:26:01.186
there cannot be mutual understanding, love and joy between them.

00:26:01.387 --> 00:26:05.088
However, the husband should also think about what wife needs

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:07.374
and what does not.

00:26:07.575 --> 00:26:09.536
But this does not mean because she is the wife,

00:26:09.737 --> 00:26:12.396
she can say something wrong or give wrong advise.

00:26:12.597 --> 00:26:14.114
In this situation, he must tell her:

00:26:14.315 --> 00:26:16.347
"This is wrong, I won't do this".

00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:19.094
"This is a lie. I won't do that."

00:26:19.295 --> 00:26:23.353
But no need to fight on small-small matters.

00:26:23.554 --> 00:26:25.707
And fighting on trivial issues,

00:26:25.908 --> 00:26:27.929
does not behove a Sahaja Yogi.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.582
I am surprised when Sahaja couples keep on fighting.

00:26:32.765 --> 00:26:35.162
They come to complain about each other.

00:26:35.363 --> 00:26:39.181
If one Sahaja couple cannot stay peacefully with each other,

00:26:39.382 --> 00:26:44.448
then how can we talk about bringing love to the entire world?

00:26:44.649 --> 00:26:47.694
It will not work out, if you keep fighting like this.

00:26:47.895 --> 00:26:53.002
So first thing is, the husband must be fully in a way

00:26:53.203 --> 00:26:56.277
alert to the needs of his wife,

00:26:56.478 --> 00:26:59.898
and know that all the other women in the world,

00:27:00.081 --> 00:27:03.049
are like his sisters and mother.

00:27:04.765 --> 00:27:07.012
If this does not manifest even after Sahaja Yoga

00:27:07.213 --> 00:27:09.400
then it cannot happen anywhere else.

00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:12.278
There was a gentleman,

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:16.345
that too a Swiss person and not an Indian.

00:27:16.546 --> 00:27:19.878
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:24.478
Girl's husband had wandering eyes,

00:27:24.679 --> 00:27:27.123
although he had come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:27.324 --> 00:27:29.010
They both came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:29.211 --> 00:27:31.941
The girl was a very good, chaste girl.

00:27:32.142 --> 00:27:35.267
He continued with this behavior wherever he went.

00:27:35.468 --> 00:27:37.696
So her father, who was not a Sahaja Yogi,

00:27:37.887 --> 00:27:40.497
told his daughter that it was better to leave him,

00:27:40.698 --> 00:27:43.540
saying that, "If someone cannot be cleansed even with Sahaja yoga,

00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:46.728
then he can never be cleansed. You leave him".

00:27:46.929 --> 00:27:48.655
She said "He has improved slightly."

00:27:48.838 --> 00:27:51.552
Father replied: "If he cannot be fully clean,

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:55.637
he is not a Sahaja Yogi. Leave him and have no relations with him".

00:27:55.838 --> 00:28:00.343
Even someone who is not a Sahaja Yogi can understand

00:28:00.544 --> 00:28:04.031
that if a person's eyes cannot be stable after Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:04.227 --> 00:28:07.780
if his attention does not become stable,

00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:10.716
then there is something wrong.

00:28:10.917 --> 00:28:13.391
Another key feature of our Indian culture

00:28:13.592 --> 00:28:16.163
is that men's and women's circle of social interactions

00:28:16.364 --> 00:28:18.372
should be restricted to brother and sister relationship.

00:28:18.573 --> 00:28:19.857
But this does not happen.

00:28:20.058 --> 00:28:22.794
I see immeadiately frivolous women

00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:25.300
just falling over to talk to men.

00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:27.772
They will chatter on with the men.

00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:31.503
I do not understand the need.

00:28:31.704 --> 00:28:34.121
They will not sit together with other women but with men.

00:28:34.322 --> 00:28:36.505
Same with some men who are engrossed by women.

00:28:36.704 --> 00:28:39.773
They see some lady and start pursuing her -

00:28:39.974 --> 00:28:43.385
any woman, even if she is a house maid or anyone else.

00:28:43.586 --> 00:28:46.063
Anyone they can reach, they will pursue.

00:28:46.238 --> 00:28:49.605
They have no self respect.

00:28:50.105 --> 00:28:52.140
They think this is manhood.

00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:55.161
but the pinnacle of manhood is Shri Rama.

00:28:55.344 --> 00:28:59.186
He is sitting up there, who is the epitome of manhood

00:28:59.387 --> 00:29:01.501
But the people who are at the lowest level,

00:29:01.684 --> 00:29:03.521
they think they represent perfect manhood.

00:29:03.704 --> 00:29:05.058
How can this be manhood?

00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:07.043
They should either not worship Shri Rama

00:29:07.218 --> 00:29:08.866
and follow the devil instead,

00:29:09.067 --> 00:29:12.212
or if they actually believe in Shri Rama, they should follow His ideals.

00:29:12.413 --> 00:29:17.634
And that is why nowadays, children and women are getting spoiled.

00:29:17.835 --> 00:29:21.025
Even then, it's a unique feature of Indian culture

00:29:21.199 --> 00:29:23.230
that women have managed well.

00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:25.140
If they were like Americans women,

00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:27.911
then all of you would have been finished.

00:29:28.112 --> 00:29:31.456
In America, they have caused trouble

00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:33.445
and the men are in a pitiable state.

00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:38.237
I tell you there if a man gets married 2-3 times,

00:29:38.428 --> 00:29:40.536
he is bankrupted

00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.722
and if a lady marries 2-3 times,

00:29:42.923 --> 00:29:45.717
she will have the means to build a palace.

00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:47.813
So what's good there?

00:29:48.014 --> 00:29:50.736
Children run away from home. What is their social structure?

00:29:50.937 --> 00:29:53.188
So this is a speciality of our Indian women,

00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:55.383
because they have grown up in Indian traditions,

00:29:55.584 --> 00:29:59.687
they manage the house and children well, know their responsibility.

00:29:59.888 --> 00:30:01.420
But this is changing.

00:30:01.621 --> 00:30:05.603
They say, "If my husband does like this, so why cannot I"?

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.931
They ask, "If he does this to me, why shouldn't I?".

00:30:08.132 --> 00:30:11.051
If he runs after 10 women, then we go with 15 men.

00:30:11.252 --> 00:30:15.467
They say, "If he is doing bad things and going to hell,

00:30:15.668 --> 00:30:17.052
then I will go before him".

00:30:17.253 --> 00:30:18.898
Women should not talk like this.

00:30:19.074 --> 00:30:22.224
The foundation of dharma is in women's hands.

00:30:22.425 --> 00:30:23.840
Women must manage this.

00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:26.525
They must bring their husband on the path of dharma

00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:29.875
by explaining and by cajoling him to keep him close.

00:30:30.076 --> 00:30:32.912
This is her biggest duty and she has this power in her.

00:30:33.095 --> 00:30:35.703
However, if she herself is not dharmic...

00:30:35.904 --> 00:30:38.112
In dharma, the biggest dharma is forgiveness.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.168
If she does not know how to forgive,

00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:43.301
then even if she follows any religion, it will be of no use.

00:30:43.502 --> 00:30:45.553
First thing she must have forgiveness.

00:30:45.784 --> 00:30:48.471
She should forgive her children, her husband,

00:30:48.672 --> 00:30:51.444
give refuge to people working in the house and everyone else.

00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:52.933
This is her duty.

00:30:53.134 --> 00:30:55.589
Some challenges come like this.

00:30:55.804 --> 00:30:57.372
Now see, this work that I am doing,

00:30:57.573 --> 00:31:01.200
even Shri Rama could not have done it, nor Shri Krishna,

00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.676
nor Lord Jesus.

00:31:03.877 --> 00:31:08.931
Had it been Shri Rama, he would cut everyone's head off.

00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:11.343
He would have killed everyone saying, "Now you go.

00:31:11.544 --> 00:31:13.326
You are useless, adharmic,

00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:16.686
you run after women, you are licentious, hence you go".

00:31:16.887 --> 00:31:19.965
Do not know how many he would be finished right away?

00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:23.984
Second, if Shri Krishna came, He would have used his sudarshan chakra.

00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:25.937
That too would have spoilt the situation.

00:31:26.138 --> 00:31:29.031
Had Lord Christ came, He would have allowed Himself to be crucified.

00:31:29.232 --> 00:31:32.071
This is very good - go for crucifixion once, work is done.

00:31:32.262 --> 00:31:35.114
Better than being crucified everyday.

00:31:35.315 --> 00:31:37.461
Only a Mother can do this work.

00:31:37.683 --> 00:31:41.351
Only a Mother can do it, because of Her power of love is so strong,

00:31:41.552 --> 00:31:45.943
that anything can be worked out by relying on Her power of love.

00:31:46.144 --> 00:31:47.860
She takes up everything

00:31:48.044 --> 00:31:50.113
and her ways are so endearing

00:31:50.314 --> 00:31:52.689
that children do not react negatively on being corrected by her.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.313
Suppose something happens, something goes wrong,

00:31:55.494 --> 00:31:57.890
it's the mother who knows how to handle it.

00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:00.002
She may scold the children later.

00:32:00.203 --> 00:32:03.659
As they know that mother loves them, scolds them for their benefit

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.517
and hence they do not grudge it.

00:32:05.748 --> 00:32:09.305
With father scolding, children may react but not with mother's.

00:32:09.496 --> 00:32:12.909
Because her love is without any self-interest.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.896
She does not want anything for herself.

00:32:15.095 --> 00:32:18.545
She wants that her children should be good, get all her powers,

00:32:18.746 --> 00:32:21.996
gain everything good that exists inside her.

00:32:22.197 --> 00:32:25.308
If a mother has these feelings

00:32:25.903 --> 00:32:27.435
then her children will turn out fine.

00:32:27.636 --> 00:32:30.918
But many mothers are very forward, abrasive,

00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:34.578
get involved in everything, will speak on everything.

00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:36.924
The poor husband will keep sitting quietly.

00:32:37.154 --> 00:32:38.977
while she will be standing in the front.

00:32:39.178 --> 00:32:41.797
When this happens, then children will become spoiled.

00:32:41.998 --> 00:32:44.733
Growing under such a adverse environment,

00:32:44.934 --> 00:32:47.737
children can grow up to be destructive,

00:32:47.938 --> 00:32:50.161
which can be very harmful.

00:32:50.362 --> 00:32:53.346
The lady, being the potential energy, should be behind

00:32:53.547 --> 00:32:55.194
and keep her husband in front.

00:32:55.395 --> 00:32:57.669
Its ok. Whatever the husband does,

00:32:57.844 --> 00:32:59.809
the wife must help him from behind.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:05.149
The source of his power is wife - this you must understand.

00:33:05.356 --> 00:33:09.081
Therefore how pure and hard-working the lady needs to be.

00:33:09.282 --> 00:33:11.650
You will say that Mother is leaving all the onus on the women.

00:33:11.851 --> 00:33:13.831
I do this because I know you are very powerful,

00:33:14.032 --> 00:33:16.045
I know we women have many powers.

00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:17.416
Because I am Myself a Mother.

00:33:17.617 --> 00:33:21.000
Now see, it's been left to Me to redeem thousands,

00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:22.564
to cure so many diseases.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.833
From morning to evening, I am curing sick people.

00:33:25.034 --> 00:33:27.623
After that, give them Realisation. Did anyone work like this?

00:33:27.824 --> 00:33:31.170
Only Ahilya was saved (by Lord Rama) and that was it.

00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:34.435
Lord Christ cured in total only about 21 people.

00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:37.662
I must have cured 21,000 people by now.

00:33:37.863 --> 00:33:42.801
I roam around the planet, doing this or that work for everyone.

00:33:43.002 --> 00:33:45.014
It's still going on, but I do not feel it's work,

00:33:45.215 --> 00:33:49.259
because it's the power of love. This power of love runs ahead of Me.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.841
Now, before going outside I think of taking a bandhan,

00:33:53.042 --> 00:33:55.127
as I don't know what kind of people touch My feet.

00:33:55.328 --> 00:33:56.722
But I forget doing this.

00:33:56.923 --> 00:33:59.090
As soon as a troubled person comes in front of Me,

00:33:59.289 --> 00:34:00.978
I absorb all their problems.

00:34:01.179 --> 00:34:04.512
The love is like that - it acts on its own.

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:08.415
I know that it is this love acting and doing all the work.

00:34:08.616 --> 00:34:10.990
I do not feel bad about this. Whatever is happening is ok.

00:34:11.205 --> 00:34:13.780
There will be some discomfort, let it happen.

00:34:13.963 --> 00:34:15.634
All this only a Mother can do.

00:34:15.835 --> 00:34:19.032
Therefore, I have my special attention on you,

00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:23.849
that you do work in a peaceful and steady manner.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:29.951
Also men need to now fully support their women,

00:34:30.152 --> 00:34:32.456
fully understand and respect them.

00:34:32.657 --> 00:34:38.451
Until the two wheels of a chariot are of the same size,

00:34:38.642 --> 00:34:40.420
it goes around in circles.

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:42.909
It does not go forward.

00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:46.426
They both should be the similar,

00:34:46.627 --> 00:34:49.958
but one is for the left and the other for the right.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:54.309
The left wheel will not fit on the right side, nor the opposite way.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.693
That is why there are two types of wheel.

00:34:56.876 --> 00:35:00.240
These both types of wheel are working well

00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:04.184
because they are alike in some sense

00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:07.176
and not alike in another sense.

00:35:08.053 --> 00:35:10.454
Compared to each other

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:17.819
they are similar in sense of height, length and width

00:35:18.002 --> 00:35:22.451
but they work differently.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:27.372
Similarly, this happens in our life.

00:35:28.078 --> 00:35:30.204
So Shri Ramachandra ji

00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:34.468
did not think only about the husband and wife.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:45.073
He did not also only think about His children and the dynasty.

00:35:45.723 --> 00:35:50.988
He thought about everyone, his brother, sister, mother, father etc.,

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.536
just like a normal human being should.

00:35:54.737 --> 00:36:00.833
After that, He thought about society as well.

00:36:01.365 --> 00:36:03.353
He thought about the general public,

00:36:03.552 --> 00:36:05.235
about the country,

00:36:05.436 --> 00:36:07.274
and kingdom.

00:36:07.475 --> 00:36:12.349
Across His life, in all normal and typical human activities,

00:36:12.532 --> 00:36:18.601
He showed how a human should ideally behave.

00:36:18.802 --> 00:36:21.808
The man who loved His wife so much,

00:36:22.015 --> 00:36:27.903
left Her despite knowing that She was completely pure.

00:36:29.016 --> 00:36:31.143
Nowadays, they make properties for the wife

00:36:31.344 --> 00:36:35.513
or the wife needs this or that thing or wants to built something.

00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:40.196
And if it's said, give 2 paisa to the poor then will not.

00:36:40.918 --> 00:36:44.310
Otherwise they give to their childen, nephews etc.

00:36:44.511 --> 00:36:46.548
It is a disease among the ruling class.

00:36:46.749 --> 00:36:50.536
And Shri Rama, He renounced even such a wife

00:36:50.737 --> 00:36:56.310
who was the incarnation of the Devi and extremely pure.

00:36:56.511 --> 00:37:00.275
Then we must re-think about our attachments,

00:37:00.476 --> 00:37:03.240
about our relationships or properties.

00:37:03.441 --> 00:37:05.161
And some people are just...

00:37:05.344 --> 00:37:08.164
Previously in the West, husband-wife relation was not good.

00:37:08.365 --> 00:37:12.124
After Sahaja Yoga relation is good, but the wife became everything.

00:37:12.325 --> 00:37:15.255
In our collective, at least 4-5 leaders had to leave Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:15.438 --> 00:37:17.566
because of their wives.

00:37:17.767 --> 00:37:20.254
Because the wife was not good, though the husband was good.

00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:24.770
Their wife brainwashed them, leading to their ruin.

00:37:24.971 --> 00:37:29.019
At least five yogis went out because of their wives.

00:37:29.561 --> 00:37:34.379
So even here I would say, that the wives should understand

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.866
what Sahaja Yoga is

00:37:37.067 --> 00:37:40.303
and what is their place in it.

00:37:40.644 --> 00:37:43.009
And the husband too, in such situations,

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.144
should not agree to his wife at all.

00:37:46.345 --> 00:37:51.540
Should tell her that, “You talk and run about too much. Be quiet!

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.630
You are of no use. Your chakras are not alright".

00:37:55.831 --> 00:37:58.949
When the husband responds to her like that,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.781
only then will she become alright.

00:38:00.982 --> 00:38:03.891
Instead you accept to spoil your chakras, if she spoils hers.

00:38:04.092 --> 00:38:06.884
If she says, "Do this", then you do that.

00:38:07.085 --> 00:38:09.979
If she tells you to steal money, then you do it.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.281
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:12.482 --> 00:38:15.366
your subtle catches still stick on.

00:38:15.567 --> 00:38:18.508
In this you must give full attention.

00:38:18.709 --> 00:38:20.333
On the occasion of Shri Rama today,

00:38:20.534 --> 00:38:23.025
we must reflect on Shri Hanuman,

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:28.706
how He was so devoted to Shri Rama

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.500
and how He was busy at His service and disposal.

00:38:34.243 --> 00:38:38.807
And being all the time at Shri Rama's service,

00:38:38.998 --> 00:38:45.077
He knew that His entire life would have significance.

00:38:46.198 --> 00:38:52.716
We should also adopt Shri Hanuman's wisdom in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:53.426 --> 00:38:55.109
This does not mean

00:38:55.316 --> 00:38:58.416
that you keep on cooking and sending food for Me. Absolutely not.

00:38:58.617 --> 00:39:00.255
Because I hardly eat anything

00:39:00.456 --> 00:39:03.938
and by cooking too much, you put Me in a difficult situation.

00:39:04.139 --> 00:39:06.359
One person sends some dish, another something else.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.255
Like it is said that food should be offered to God first,

00:39:09.462 --> 00:39:12.383
but for a God who does not eat, why trouble Her with food?

00:39:12.584 --> 00:39:14.526
Food is not needed. Nothing is needed.

00:39:14.749 --> 00:39:18.437
What is required is a commitment to serve without any delay.

00:39:18.638 --> 00:39:22.032
Did Shri Hanuman ever cook and send food to Shri Rama?

00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:25.483
Delhi people have bothered Me so much cooking for Me all the time,

00:39:25.684 --> 00:39:27.221
that I have stipulated

00:39:27.404 --> 00:39:30.841
that if they cook anymore, I would not come to Delhi.

00:39:32.032 --> 00:39:34.937
Do what is required.

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:39.572
It is useless to force food on someone who does not eat.

00:39:39.773 --> 00:39:43.182
Or for someone without any needs, getting bangles or something else.

00:39:43.383 --> 00:39:45.047
Your Mother does not need anything.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.579
My house is full. I am troubled by all this.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.716
I say that get only flowers and nothing else.

00:39:50.917 --> 00:39:52.589
I need nothing. Flowers are enough.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.324
And decoration with flowers should not be of thousands rupees.

00:39:55.525 --> 00:39:57.946
Today you have decorated flowers modestly, not too much.

00:39:58.147 --> 00:40:02.381
Sometimes I'm worried with how many flowers you put on the stage.

00:40:02.868 --> 00:40:06.269
So do things in balance, so that your Mother will appreciate it.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:10.801
Your Mother is simple. She has no appreciation for these things.

00:40:11.622 --> 00:40:16.982
So I want to emphasise, that you need to learn from Shri Hanuman,

00:40:17.183 --> 00:40:19.045
to find contentment in serving.

00:40:19.246 --> 00:40:21.180
So what service is specifically needed?

00:40:21.363 --> 00:40:24.050
I need no special service.

00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:27.476
I am healthy and need not much service.

00:40:27.677 --> 00:40:32.141
However, if you want to serve Me, then do service to Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:32.989 --> 00:40:36.243
Whoever will be serving in Sahaja Yoga, will be serving Me.

00:40:36.444 --> 00:40:38.720
How many people have you given Realisation?

00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:41.124
How many women have you given Realisation to?

00:40:41.325 --> 00:40:44.622
How many did you transform? How many did you take interest in?

00:40:44.823 --> 00:40:46.657
Whenever someone new comes to the program

00:40:46.887 --> 00:40:49.868
yogis say, "You have this or that possession", they get after him.

00:40:50.067 --> 00:40:51.135
So he runs away.

00:40:51.336 --> 00:40:54.933
I asked a gentleman, "You got your Realisation. Why did you leave?"

00:40:55.134 --> 00:40:56.483
He said that after the program,

00:40:56.651 --> 00:40:59.849
yogis told him he had three possessions inside.

00:41:01.196 --> 00:41:04.186
He was even told the number of bhoots.

00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:08.504
I asked him why did he believe the yogi?

00:41:08.695 --> 00:41:10.673
He said that he seemed like an authority

00:41:10.874 --> 00:41:14.453
and came running to tell him that he had three possessions.

00:41:14.654 --> 00:41:17.745
I do not know who said that to him, but the newcomer ran away.

00:41:17.946 --> 00:41:20.613
So in Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:24.230
what we need to learn from Shri Hanuman is His eagerness.

00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:28.045
"Ram kaj karne ko tatpar" (eager to do Shri Rama's work).

00:41:28.246 --> 00:41:30.050
What is our kaj (work)?

00:41:30.225 --> 00:41:32.519
"My work is Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.245
My work is Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:35.446 --> 00:41:38.446
to raise the Kundalini, to give Realisation to people,

00:41:38.647 --> 00:41:42.007
to get peace and love in them,

00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:46.230
to talk about love.

00:41:47.753 --> 00:41:53.174
explaining about all chakras etc. in Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:53.375 --> 00:41:55.314
whatever they need - to explain that".

00:41:55.515 --> 00:41:58.791
Now when I said this, people started giving long lectures.

00:41:58.998 --> 00:42:02.350
Some people started giving so many lectures

00:42:02.551 --> 00:42:06.136
that I had to tell them to stop

00:42:06.337 --> 00:42:08.278
otherwise the other yogis will be finished.

00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:11.145
People complained that they lecture for 2 hours.

00:42:11.344 --> 00:42:14.190
There is no time to hear Your talk and do Aarti.

00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:16.017
We have to go home just with this.

00:42:16.218 --> 00:42:18.118
So I had that person's lecture stopped.

00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:20.952
He said that when I go then he doesn't know what happens to him.

00:42:21.153 --> 00:42:25.197
He told Me, "I feel like giving a lecture. How can I correct this?".

00:42:25.398 --> 00:42:28.589
I told him, "You put supari (betel nut) in your mouth."

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.780
"How large the nut should be?" - he asked Me.

00:42:33.862 --> 00:42:37.524
I said, "It depends on the size of your mouth.

00:42:37.725 --> 00:42:40.745
If you do not even know how big should be the betel nut,

00:42:40.946 --> 00:42:43.249
then what do you talk about Sahaja Yoga?

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.426
You do not have this wisdom either".

00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:49.357
People like talking a lot in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:49.558 --> 00:42:51.944
They think they have got a platform to give lectures.

00:42:52.145 --> 00:42:55.919
They have got the mike and want to speak. Cannot leave the mike.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.492
Once they got hold of the mic they cannot leave it.

00:42:58.723 --> 00:43:01.327
This is a new disease.

00:43:02.147 --> 00:43:05.899
So you must understand, "Why to give a lecture?

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.674
There are so many of Mother's lectures, listen to those only".

00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:11.794
So whenever you have a function,

00:43:11.995 --> 00:43:15.764
display a video of Mine

00:43:15.943 --> 00:43:17.784
or play My tapes.

00:43:17.985 --> 00:43:22.868
Give pencil and paper to people, after, to write their questions.

00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:26.320
Then you give them Realisation

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.469
and ask them to write any of their problems and bring it next time,

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.970
any problem in the beginning like someone is sick or in trouble.

00:43:35.183 --> 00:43:37.249
Now there are also people like this -

00:43:37.447 --> 00:43:41.579
there is one person, he would even come to Calcutta to cure someone.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.990
Now he will go...

00:43:44.173 --> 00:43:49.109
Now people are inviting him to come to Russia to cure people.

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:53.498
One person only is running from here to there like Shri Hanuman.

00:43:53.699 --> 00:43:55.538
All of you can cure.

00:43:55.713 --> 00:43:57.963
All of you can cure everyone.

00:43:58.164 --> 00:44:00.507
All women can do it, all men can do it as well,

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:02.623
but no one tries.

00:44:02.824 --> 00:44:06.939
By giving lectures how many have been cured?

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.100
I don't know why there is only one person in India

00:44:11.276 --> 00:44:12.788
who can cure people,

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:17.573
while in London there are 15-20 people who can cure

00:44:17.843 --> 00:44:20.082
and there are in France as well.

00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:23.750
One should learn the technique to clear people.

00:44:23.972 --> 00:44:26.418
Take a bandhan and do it.

00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:29.676
For this, will you call people from outside?

00:44:29.877 --> 00:44:31.702
For what purpose are you a Sahaja Yogi?

00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:35.210
You roam around wearing a badge of Sahaja Yoga but cannot even cure.

00:44:35.358 --> 00:44:37.099
Then, remove the badge.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.769
You cannot even clear yourself or cure your diseases,

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.338
so how will you cure others?

00:44:42.539 --> 00:44:48.217
I must tell you that everybody has got all the power to cure anyone.

00:44:48.418 --> 00:44:51.071
You must learn this. You must master it.

00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:54.145
Instead of inviting someone to Calcutta,

00:44:54.336 --> 00:44:57.009
people from Calcutta should go out to cure.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.975
It's a matter of a little courage. Nohting will happen to you.

00:45:00.158 --> 00:45:02.891
Neither can you get sick or anything else can happen.

00:45:03.092 --> 00:45:06.159
The more you work in Sahaja Yoga, the deeper you will become.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.986
Because the wider the tree is, the deeper its roots are.

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:18.237
Between Sahaja Yoga and work of other incarnations,

00:45:18.436 --> 00:45:20.749
there is one major difference.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:25.737
The other incarnations had never worked in society before.

00:45:25.938 --> 00:45:28.404
Nobody had got these powers.

00:45:28.722 --> 00:45:30.409
It was not for the masses.

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.182
Only one or two people had attained this power.

00:45:33.383 --> 00:45:36.495
Like King Janaka who gave Realisation to Nachiketa.

00:45:36.696 --> 00:45:39.235
But now you all have got this power.

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:45.125
Now just grow in such a manner that you do not need anything else.

00:45:45.637 --> 00:45:49.073
You can cure yourself, you can cure others.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.387
You can understand Sahaja Yoga. You have everything you need.

00:45:52.588 --> 00:45:55.603
But even now your attention is wandering.

00:45:55.808 --> 00:45:58.068
I do not understand, what are you running after?

00:45:58.269 --> 00:46:01.077
You have still not grasped this.

00:46:01.278 --> 00:46:04.791
In Sahaja Yoga, for everyone there is nothing but blessings.

00:46:04.992 --> 00:46:09.060
You will not have any shortage of anything.

00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:12.176
That is if you contribute to something in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:12.377 --> 00:46:14.444
Even if you do not work, you will get blessings.

00:46:14.645 --> 00:46:18.191
Whoever I see, his business increased or career progressed,

00:46:18.382 --> 00:46:20.800
this or that worked out for him.

00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:24.662
Everyone is continously receiving something or the other.

00:46:25.488 --> 00:46:27.731
There was no sacrifice needed.

00:46:27.932 --> 00:46:29.828
On the other hand, let me tell you

00:46:30.029 --> 00:46:33.343
when the freedom struggle in India happened,

00:46:33.544 --> 00:46:36.569
even we were troubled so much.

00:46:36.833 --> 00:46:39.414
made to lie down on ice, given electric shocks.

00:46:39.615 --> 00:46:43.951
My father and mother went to jail so many times. Our house was sold.

00:46:44.152 --> 00:46:46.729
We started living in a hut... our cars were also sold.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.762
We sacrified so much. You do not have to do anything like that.

00:46:51.824 --> 00:46:54.796
But it should not be only receiving all the time.

00:46:55.011 --> 00:46:56.555
You need to give as well.

00:46:56.756 --> 00:46:59.317
If one door is open,

00:46:59.754 --> 00:47:02.008
you should open another one as well.

00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:04.435
Keeping only one door open does not make the air flow.

00:47:04.636 --> 00:47:07.328
Everyone tells Me that "I received this blessing or that blessing".

00:47:07.527 --> 00:47:10.757
What benevolence have you done to others?

00:47:12.192 --> 00:47:14.202
We must pay attention to this aspect:

00:47:14.403 --> 00:47:18.859
"What benevolent action did we do?".

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.431
But there are many fights for leadership.

00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:25.302
Who will be the leader? Many big fights.

00:47:25.461 --> 00:47:27.990
There is a readymade platform so people want to lead.

00:47:28.197 --> 00:47:31.394
You should know that all this is Mother's play.

00:47:31.595 --> 00:47:35.469
You will not know the day that you fall from there.

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.807
Specially women should not get involved in leadership politics.

00:47:39.014 --> 00:47:42.313
They will fall from the top to the bottom immediately.

00:47:42.514 --> 00:47:47.268
And men should also understand, that there is no leader as such.

00:47:47.469 --> 00:47:51.025
This is a game made by Mother and do not get entangled in this.

00:47:51.226 --> 00:47:54.586
So I said that, "Let the leaders come forward". Leaders of what?

00:47:54.824 --> 00:47:57.073
All this is a game made by the Mother.

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:59.121
There are no leaders.

00:47:59.322 --> 00:48:02.936
This is just a test of your wisdom.

00:48:03.137 --> 00:48:06.779
If you ego rises due to leadership, then you are gone.

00:48:07.842 --> 00:48:09.374
It will be revealed immediately.

00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:14.081
In Sahaja Yoga nothing is hidden. Everything is exposed.

00:48:14.582 --> 00:48:17.553
Even if I say something or not,

00:48:17.754 --> 00:48:21.084
they will expose their faces by themselves, on their own.

00:48:21.285 --> 00:48:25.093
He says, "I am the leader" - and tomorrow he will shame himself. Why?

00:48:25.268 --> 00:48:27.416
They say that they did this bad thing.

00:48:27.617 --> 00:48:30.934
So the leader has greater responsibility

00:48:31.102 --> 00:48:35.792
to be better, sweet, humble and loving than others

00:48:36.939 --> 00:48:41.049
and taking everyone along, consulting them and moving forward.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.628
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama special day today,

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:50.385
we should pray for all qualities demonstrated in His life.

00:48:50.607 --> 00:48:52.897
If you can do only even a fraction of what He did,

00:48:53.098 --> 00:48:56.430
your Mother's life would be most worthwhile.

00:48:56.631 --> 00:48:59.547
He was in exile in the jungle for so many days.

00:48:59.746 --> 00:49:07.285
He wandered in jungles barefeet, did so much hard work.

00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:11.250
And He did this just to obey the order of His father.

00:49:11.451 --> 00:49:15.405
Now to obey Me, you need not to go into the forest for exile.

00:49:15.606 --> 00:49:18.956
Nor to be barefeet or go hungry. Nothing at all.

00:49:19.147 --> 00:49:20.731
Everything is ok.

00:49:20.932 --> 00:49:24.741
But in Sahaja Yoga, you must know how to cure people

00:49:24.939 --> 00:49:27.159
and their diseases.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.680
And you should have complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:30.881 --> 00:49:32.885
and most importantly you should know,

00:49:33.084 --> 00:49:35.279
that Sahaja Yoga is love.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.254
It is the power of love that is working things out and no one else.

00:49:39.455 --> 00:49:43.039
Because of that power, everyone can prosper.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.673
This is not for one person

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.579
or for any special people.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.169
This is neither for any one country

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:56.558
but for the whole world.

00:49:57.536 --> 00:50:01.562
We should see also is how our attention is and where does it go.

00:50:01.776 --> 00:50:06.300
If again and again it wanders, we should restrain it, stop it.

00:50:06.501 --> 00:50:09.455
Fill the power of Spirit in your attention.

00:50:09.638 --> 00:50:13.535
And a person should do every task with unwavering attention.

00:50:13.736 --> 00:50:17.037
The person who will do this with devotion and love,

00:50:17.238 --> 00:50:19.722
will go very deep.

00:50:20.214 --> 00:50:26.719
Or if not, there is anyways a lot of rubbish around.

00:50:27.089 --> 00:50:32.436
And you know how garbage is finally disposed off.

00:50:32.637 --> 00:50:35.076
So if you want to become garbage

00:50:35.277 --> 00:50:37.234
and you feel that you are very special,

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:39.890
you are very good and can do this or that...

00:50:40.091 --> 00:50:42.815
First thing is humility,

00:50:43.164 --> 00:50:46.114
not only towards Me but towards everyone.

00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:49.865
Talk humbly and with love.

00:50:50.119 --> 00:50:55.665
You will see how an ordinary human, who is useless,

00:50:55.866 --> 00:50:58.829
can blossom like a lotus in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.290
And his fragrance spreads in all four direction.

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:03.290
People come and tell Me immediately,

00:51:03.491 --> 00:51:07.316
"Mother, he is a wonderful person, he is indeed like this".

00:51:07.517 --> 00:51:10.061
Like that you should work.

00:51:10.262 --> 00:51:13.229
Like people say about Maryada Purushottama that He was wonderful,

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:15.131
similarly they will say about you.

00:51:15.332 --> 00:51:18.625
The biggest thing is that for Me, you are the temple of Shri Rama

00:51:18.832 --> 00:51:21.079
and you have to develop this temple within you.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.179
Let it be worshipped. Take care of it.

00:51:24.386 --> 00:51:27.777
Watch it and live with your self-esteem intact.

00:51:27.978 --> 00:51:34.156
Take the full benefit

00:51:34.331 --> 00:51:36.875
of your Self-Realization.

00:51:37.076 --> 00:51:41.308
Along with that, you must have full respect and devotion towards it.

00:51:41.509 --> 00:51:44.808
You should think, "Now we are realized. How can we do this?"

00:51:45.009 --> 00:51:47.120
"We are yogis. We cannot do this.

00:51:47.321 --> 00:51:49.722
This cannot be done by us as this is wrong."

00:51:49.923 --> 00:51:54.078
You will see that you will receive blessings immediately,

00:51:54.685 --> 00:51:56.389
immediately, at that time.

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:59.568
People are calling me Rokhra (money) Devi,

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:02.716
as they decide something and money come in for that.

00:52:02.917 --> 00:52:06.257
So many results, so much benefits everyone is getting.

00:52:06.448 --> 00:52:11.416
Now based on your blessings, pass them to the world as well.

00:52:12.308 --> 00:52:18.836
Like Shri Rama used all His powers for the benevolence of people

00:52:19.037 --> 00:52:22.649
and for the world to see an ideal man,

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.839
the embodiment of an ideal man.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:30.244
Whenever this occurs inside us, you will be surprised,

00:52:30.412 --> 00:52:33.664
what level you will reach.

00:52:33.865 --> 00:52:37.632
You should not have any disease left. All diseases should go away.

00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:41.699
Clear off everything. All bad habits should be dropped.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.749
Eat what is needed, talk as much as needed.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:48.088
Witness everything

00:52:48.289 --> 00:52:50.336
and for this you must look inward.

00:52:50.537 --> 00:52:56.424
You should have a perceptive mind and introspect,

00:52:56.623 --> 00:52:58.569
that is looking inside yourself,

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:00.389
looking inside yourself -

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:02.422
"antar nirikshan" (internal inspection).

00:53:02.623 --> 00:53:06.081
Keep on watching, "What am I doing? Why am I doing this or that?

00:53:06.284 --> 00:53:07.891
What should I be doing?

00:53:08.092 --> 00:53:11.037
There is no need for this. I am a Sahaja Yogi. Why am I doing this?

00:53:11.238 --> 00:53:13.967
Where is my mind going? Stop it."

00:53:14.476 --> 00:53:18.172
By doing this all the time, you will get into meditation.

00:53:18.373 --> 00:53:21.650
And on its own, your Kundalini will be pleased with this

00:53:21.851 --> 00:53:24.594
and bless you with a lot of contentment,

00:53:24.795 --> 00:53:27.408
that you will say, "Mother, what a blessing I have received!"

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:32.283
But only when you jump into it, you know what it is.

00:53:32.484 --> 00:53:36.554
Jumping into it is the only small bit of hard work.

00:53:36.755 --> 00:53:40.574
Shri Rama was born at midnight,

00:53:40.775 --> 00:53:43.399
so I had said, "Let's have the Puja at leisure". So that's how it is.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.597
In Shri Rama's Puja, there is not much work

00:53:46.798 --> 00:53:50.046
as is not very elaborate or long.

00:53:50.247 --> 00:53:52.688
But there is certainly something to understand,

00:53:52.879 --> 00:53:55.019
because He was in human form,

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.190
so being in human form,

00:53:57.391 --> 00:54:03.916
He represents the humanity within us

00:54:04.117 --> 00:54:06.317
through which we understand the world,

00:54:06.518 --> 00:54:12.386
through which our intellect, our interest and our thoughts

00:54:12.632 --> 00:54:14.419
get changed.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.306
All these things are Shri Rama.

00:54:17.478 --> 00:54:21.689
Only through Him, can our ideas change.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:25.000
Only through Him, can our nature change

00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:27.859
because He is our ideal.

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.468
Only after achieving Him as an ideal,

00:54:30.669 --> 00:54:32.856
you can reach other higher ideals

00:54:33.057 --> 00:54:35.380
as He was the ideal human being.

00:54:35.581 --> 00:54:36.923
It is such a big thing,

00:54:37.145 --> 00:54:39.811
that God decided to come to this world in a human form

00:54:40.012 --> 00:54:41.762
to became our ideal.

00:54:41.963 --> 00:54:44.822
He went through all hardships and adversity,

00:54:45.021 --> 00:54:48.888
to show us that despite any adversity,

00:54:49.095 --> 00:54:51.319
a person should not abandon his Dharma.

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.731
You should not leave the path of Vishwa Dharma

00:54:53.932 --> 00:54:56.838
and maintain your state of yoga.

00:54:57.039 --> 00:55:00.850
My unending blessings to you all.
