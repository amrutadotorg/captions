00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.640
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.700
everybody has said

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.610
Mother please tell us about Shri Ram

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:23.670
As you know that Shri Rama has taken
a very important place in our chakras

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.010
He is sitting on our right heart

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.910
Shri Rama has taken a place of a father

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:54.847
so lack of father's duty and love
can cause a catch of this chakra

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.513
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand
that Rama and all other gods

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.440
came on earth with different power (shakti),

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.530
they came to do their jobs

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:22.356
In the sense Shri Rama has a special job

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.730
Socrates has said
benevolent king has to come

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.212
For that Shri Rama came

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.350
Shri Rama came in complete human form

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.700
He even forgot that

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.410
he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu
He was made to be forgotten

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:59.420
But he was Purushottam on earth
(perfect human being)

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.150
you all must have heard of
his qualities and his childhood

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.686
In Sahaja yoga
when we worship any god

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:30.800
what quality we gain from them

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.440
which qualities we will receive?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.900
Shri Rama has many

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:47.910
One that he was ideal
another that he is a king

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.030
he kept his people higher than himself

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.000
than his wife and children

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:06.290
If politicians today

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.840
understand this point

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.940
they wouldn't be called selfish

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.130
they wouldn't be selfish

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.480
would be follower of Dharma.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.720
Nobody has followed

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.720
Shri Rama as a role model
till today

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.680
By singing his bhajans

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.901
or building an institutions and temples
in his name

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:44.380
Shri Rama come to you?

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.120
Do you get his light in your life?

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:57.416
Only sahaj yogi can bring the light
of Shri Rama into the attention

00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:02.306
He is totally beyond

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.105
Basically all the deities are
free from papas and punyas

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.285
so called sins
they never sin

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:16.645
Shri Krishna killed many people

00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:20.933
Shri Rama killed Ravana

00:04:20.943 --> 00:04:25.895
It can be a sin in worldly sense

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.005
but not in the eyes of god

00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:41.240
As they destroy and remove evils
they have rights to do anything

00:04:41.265 --> 00:04:49.350
When Devi slayed Rakshas
she has committed a sin?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.899
Their work is to destroy the
rakshas and protect the saints

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.465
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is
the most important

00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:14.336
she was cursed by her husband

00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:19.902
In those times if any women
goes out of dharma

00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:26.215
and if her husband is high saint
he could curse

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:32.075
But Ahillya was blamed falsely

00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:37.481
And she was made into stone falsely

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.710
So shri Rama saved Ahilya

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:55.779
Especially his quality to have only one wife

00:05:56.263 --> 00:06:01.103
his love to one wife must be understood

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.185
Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi
she herself is a Goddess

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:18.745
But as a Human he never looked
at any other women but his wife

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.269
When we talk about Rama
we should have the husband pure

00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:28.433
To worships shri Rama

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:38.825
Women should have the same faith
in husbands as Sitaji used to

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:45.103
Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram
who believed one wife

00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:48.055
Not difficult for sahaja yogis

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.030
Women should be respected
Have respect for wifes

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.040
When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.705
Shri Rama felt his duty
to rescue her

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:10.330
But in his kingdom
he was so just that

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.670
For people he left her
after spending so many years to rescue

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.820
As Sitaji herself a Devi
so there's no effect

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.706
So Shri Rama did it

00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:33.227
to keep the benevolence
of public opinion

00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:37.340
that society wouln't accpect the women

00:07:37.365 --> 00:07:43.330
who are questioned.

00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:49.788
Although she is a Devi
Pure and Nirmala

00:07:49.813 --> 00:07:54.216
Later that
Sita also left him somehow

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.915
She left him as a woman
and Shri Rama as a man

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:09.234
Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth
and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:16.318
Their life is very eventful
and full of Miracles

00:08:16.485 --> 00:08:25.817
You see how shri Sita and Rama
have good attitude and are faithful each other

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:31.895
Even if she was left
Sita thought it her duty

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:37.985
She never complained
or talked ill of him

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:44.467
And effortlessly
she has raised her children

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:50.632
Shri Rama's children are
called Luv and Kush

00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:59.534
They came as devotees
and we can see them as disciples

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.770
They represents Shisya (disciples)

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:10.770
the power of Shisya
so we can be disciple of someone

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.800
As disciples they learned archery
when they were small

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:24.218
And learned Ramayana
and got proficiency in the music

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:32.115
Showing the disciples must surrender completely
to the Guru

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:36.745
We also have a disciples in us

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:44.228
They were  completely surrendered to
the Mother who is Shakti

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:50.180
Even they were about to fight
against Shri Rama

00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:53.680
they kept Mother highest in the world

00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:00.350
The mother cared them
and made them completely dharmic

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.270
It was her first duty

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.330
Not like today wives just cry
"my husband left me"

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:14.323
But with husband they fight always
and if he leaves they will cry

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:23.117
He has left no problem
I have children, I will care for them

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:28.110
they will get all they need

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:37.890
Sitaj's life was special
with bravery and strength

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.810
Every woman must have it

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.880
Even if you are separated with your
husband or far away

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:53.680
there shouldn't be any loss
or shortage for children

00:10:53.825 --> 00:10:59.353
Because her duty
is the most important thing

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.698
We shouldn't give up
most important thing

00:11:02.884 --> 00:11:09.455
In sahaja yoga
all women should get this power

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.650
Shri Rama's life was
very pure and Nirmal

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.720
he gave up everything
for his wife

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:30.000
His wife had gone, he had to live alone
and he had to leave her

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.360
He gave up all the comforts of the life

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:41.560
You know he used to sleep
on grass, on floor and walked barefeet

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.156
and wear clothes like saints

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.930
All these are not stories
it's a fact

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:57.030
In India many people used to have
high standard life

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.850
and they have never thought about
small and low level things

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:09.946
But all these ideals of our country
have beccome fake

00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:16.765
By singing bhajans to Ram
we think we are done

00:12:16.765 --> 00:12:19.895
we have got a kind of hypocracy

00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:23.727
In countries without
these ideals

00:12:23.752 --> 00:12:29.095
people try to become the ideals
correcting themselves

00:12:29.151 --> 00:12:33.886
If you have the ideal in front of us

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.240
you don't  become Shri Rama or Krishna

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.780
or you have anything to do with them

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.110
We feel like that

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.733
But if we have Shri Rama inside
his light can be in our attention

00:12:49.788 --> 00:12:52.828
Let's understand

00:12:52.987 --> 00:12:59.371
the circumstances when
Shri Rama came on earth

00:12:59.499 --> 00:13:01.993
Sahaja Yogi must understand

00:13:02.026 --> 00:13:12.000
If we get Shri Rama's state
All our political problems will go

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:17.083
when we decide to
become like shri Rama

00:13:32.573 --> 00:13:36.300
Then everyone becomes good

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:47.830
firstly dharma, success and education
then the ideals

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.970
for that he made his life very idealistic

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:01.950
When someone tells you something
but he doesn't do it himself

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.532
Then how can you trust him and get his quality

00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:10.790
There are many people who say
we believe in this and that

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.760
But they are opposite

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:22.694
Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician
and they have many wives, impossible

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.390
What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life?

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.871
we have to bring the light of god
in our attention

00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:39.555
We must see and behave as Shri Rama

00:14:39.873 --> 00:14:47.198
What would Shri Rama or Sita do
in this situation

00:14:47.208 --> 00:14:52.875
What would Sita ji say?

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.154
How would Sita behave?
She is also Gruhlaxmi

00:14:57.265 --> 00:15:02.780
As you know Sitaji took many births

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:09.350
Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:16.535
She was humbly in the house but all
dharma was done by her power

00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:22.845
Not necessary for her to go out
and give big lectures

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:32.730
You can do that work at home
with children relatives and friends

00:15:32.755 --> 00:15:37.620
you can spread sahaja Yoga at the house

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.850
After getting all of it
you can go out to society

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:52.340
But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.600
First thing of the purity is
motherhood and love

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:03.230
When she was in exile never complained
that my husband doesn't earn

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.445
He doesn't do this
he doesn't buy this and that

00:16:08.445 --> 00:16:13.500
If he is in jungle so I am
What he will eat I wil

00:16:13.525 --> 00:16:18.307
I don't eat before him
I serve him first

00:16:18.457 --> 00:16:22.671
and  brother in law then I will eat

00:16:22.751 --> 00:16:36.750
Nowadays women think there is
much pressure of the work But it is not

00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:43.706
A woman is like earth element
she can absorb

00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:48.652
So many are given by the earth

00:16:48.677 --> 00:16:53.460
In the same way
women are like the earth

00:16:53.485 --> 00:16:58.511
We have got so many powers
that we can take everything inside

00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:04.892
and shower the rain of love
God has given us the power

00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:14.842
For example this fan is moving
Which one is greater, the power or fan?

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:23.230
If you think fan is greater as  it's moving
Then it's wrong

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.570
Women are ocean of shakti

00:17:27.595 --> 00:17:32.445
With that support Men does their work

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:39.709
They are potential and kinetic
Women are potential and men are kinetic

00:17:39.812 --> 00:17:45.025
But if you start running like them

00:17:45.025 --> 00:17:48.375
It's not good
No need for women

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:58.056
Each one is unique but equally important
But women can be good for both

00:17:58.136 --> 00:18:02.695
When the time comes
women can be more productive

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.230
In Maharashtra
there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.640
She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.070
Only she could defeat Aurangzeb

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.175
Her grave was built

00:18:21.175 --> 00:18:34.789
You must understand women can keep all her
power within her to become ferocious

00:18:34.911 --> 00:18:47.210
But  if she waste her powers in
fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.340
then her power would be gone

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:58.640
Women are so powerful that
she can work more than men if she want

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.117
But first of all
she must respect her powers

00:19:02.134 --> 00:19:08.303
by scattering and wasting she becomes powerless

00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:10.954
this kind of woman is not good

00:19:11.168 --> 00:19:18.214
Women's job is very important and full of dignity

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:22.901
Women should be very modest and very wise

00:19:23.005 --> 00:19:27.795
Let Men use bad words but women cannot

00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:34.459
Men can argue and would fight
let them do but not Women

00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:42.483
Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people

00:19:42.824 --> 00:19:50.170
She is like shield not like sword
and sword cannot be shield

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:57.120
Shield is greater than sword
as shield can bear the sword

00:19:57.145 --> 00:20:01.590
Sword can be broken
but not shield

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:10.210
So her most important power is humility

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.220
With humility comes all the powers

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:19.050
It's not difficult for sahaj yogis
not at all

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.120
I see many sahaja yoginis chat a lot

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.820
anywhere they will chat with men

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.110
"Mother help me" "what happened"

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.670
"The lady talks a lot please help me"

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.595
"I am tired of her"

00:20:38.605 --> 00:20:43.851
There isn't much to talk with men
What's the need?

00:20:44.091 --> 00:20:47.453
Among women also

00:20:47.553 --> 00:20:53.115
In sahaja yoga men study more

00:20:53.115 --> 00:20:55.475
About Sahaja Yoga and the chakras

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:03.370
Which chakra is driving people and is catching?

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.260
Man knows all
women would be left behind

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.172
Women must learn

00:21:09.322 --> 00:21:15.735
For men Shri Rama is our ideal

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.435
In this sense Muslims are amazing

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.865
I don't want to say bad things

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:31.550
Say if you go to Riyad
no  Muslim will see you

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.180
they will respect women
If women are crossing the street

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.350
they will stop the car
respecting women

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.220
But here it's opposite
I don't know why

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.780
we see women with some intention

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.870
Seeing every woman
they will break the neck

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.390
It's a big sin to see every woman

00:21:59.409 --> 00:22:03.289
In sahaja yoga it's prohibited completely

00:22:03.314 --> 00:22:08.585
Firstly you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:13.630
Otherwise you may become blind

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.740
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes

00:22:17.765 --> 00:22:22.115
While talking eyes are wandering
women too

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.430
The biggest loss is your attention

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.670
Your attention goes here and there

00:22:30.695 --> 00:22:35.055
then what's the use of self-realization

00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:41.390
Without concentration Chitta can't be active

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.580
Concentration must be obtained

00:22:46.613 --> 00:22:51.253
In the west the disease is
more common among men

00:22:51.285 --> 00:22:57.185
Western yogis are not alike
They know it's bad

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.300
They asked me the solution

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:10.815
Look at only ground and up to 3 feets
you don't have to see above

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:19.210
Look at the ground
Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:29.380
You see all good things, flowers and children
Nothing to see above

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.920
So, that's how you should control your chitta

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:38.780
Shri Rama didn't need it
If you have a respect to shri Rama

00:23:38.805 --> 00:23:43.505
You must control your chitta like him

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:54.778
Tell your wife you respect her as shakti
But she has to deserve it

00:23:54.888 --> 00:23:59.155
"Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata"

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:09.994
"Where women are respected resides
god" But they have to be respectable

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.788
Please sit down

00:24:14.002 --> 00:24:18.780
Don't move during Puja

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:24.520
If the woman is worshipable
"Pujyante" means "worshipable"

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:32.670
Who like to worship a bad woman
cruel Rakshasi?

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:40.030
Those who are worshpable should be worshipped
There resides gods

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.936
Firstly they are mothers of children

00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:49.984
If husband scolds wife in front of children

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.540
then children will never respect mother

00:24:54.565 --> 00:24:58.675
It's prime minister and deputy minister

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.760
Women shouldn't insult her husband too

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:09.710
Power goes to children from father

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:18.167
Without this basic understanding
they fight to take control

00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:22.690
If woman knows handling of man
there won't be any fights

00:25:22.715 --> 00:25:28.970
Handling men is very easy
as they are just like children

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:34.655
they are innocent like children

00:25:34.655 --> 00:25:38.295
By talking nonsense
you can't handle them

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.564
You must forgive them as children

00:25:41.775 --> 00:25:45.355
If they fight outside
they get troubled

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.820
They can get angry only to wife

00:25:48.845 --> 00:25:51.905
Getting angry at home is OK

00:25:51.930 --> 00:26:01.067
Until you get this feeling, you cannot have
mutual understanding, love and joy

00:26:01.242 --> 00:26:07.162
Men also should care for wife's needs

00:26:07.187 --> 00:26:19.145
if wife is wrong, husband has duty to say no
"It's wrong, I won't do this"

00:26:19.145 --> 00:26:25.565
But no need to fight on small things
It doesn't look good as sahaja yogis

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.320
I am surprised that
Sahaja couples fight each other

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:35.250
They come to complain about each other

00:26:35.275 --> 00:26:44.475
How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully
while I'm talking about peace to the whole world

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.760
It won't work out if you are fighting like that

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:55.919
Husband has to have complete
understanding of his wife first

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:04.570
And know that all the other women
are like your sisters and mothers

00:27:04.595 --> 00:27:09.375
If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga
then there's no way out

00:27:09.375 --> 00:27:14.405
There was a swiss man
not a Sahaja Yogi

00:27:14.405 --> 00:27:20.310
Not Indian
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:27.155
Girl's husband had wandering
eyes but came to sahaja yoga

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:35.178
They both came to Sahaja Yoga
The girl is very good but he went on doing it

00:27:35.297 --> 00:27:40.480
The non-yogi father told her to leave him

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.840
"Even after sahaja yoga if he can't be cleansed
then leave him"

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:54.980
"He is not a Sahaja Yogi don't relate with him"

00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:04.020
Even Non-Sahaja Yogi can understand
that the person can't be cleansed

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:10.830
He doesn't have stable attention
then it is bad

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:18.390
Our culture is that men and women
must be brother and sister

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:25.350
But I see a talkative woman
just go to talk to men

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:34.060
I don't understand it
They don't sit with other ladies but with men

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:39.735
Same with men just start chatting with women

00:28:39.735 --> 00:28:49.905
Even with maid or anyone
just start talking, no self-esteem

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:57.350
We think it's masculinity but Shri Rama is
the perfect man who is highest

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.350
But the one at the bottom
think they are perfect

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:08.630
Where is perfection?
Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.280
If you believe in Shri Rama
follow his ideal

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:17.716
Therefore children and women
are getting spoiled

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:23.230
But still Indian women maintained
good culture here

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:33.050
If they were like Americans what it would have been
Men are fixed in terrible condition there

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:46.650
After 2-3 marriages Men becomes
bunkrupt but women make a palace

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.680
It's bad in America
Children are running away from home

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:59.820
Indian woman manage their house
husband and children

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:05.695
But it's changing
They think the same like husbands

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:11.120
If he runs away with 10 women
then we go with 15 men

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.970
If he is going to hell then I go before him

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:22.305
Women shouldn't do it
The base of dharma is in woman's hand

00:30:22.305 --> 00:30:29.925
Woman must manage husband dharmic
making him understand

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:35.527
This is the biggest duty and power
of woman to be Dharmaic

00:30:35.552 --> 00:30:43.190
Biggest dharma is forgiveness
Without it nothing works out

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:48.440
First thing she must have forgiveness
Forgive children, husband

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.900
give refuge to house servants
all are her duty

00:30:52.925 --> 00:31:03.521
This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do
neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus

00:31:03.713 --> 00:31:16.690
Rama would have killed everyone
who is useless, adharmic and flirt

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.100
Don't know how many he would be finished

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.710
Krishna would use his sudarshan
chakra and there would be a battle

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.945
Christ would crucify himself

00:31:28.945 --> 00:31:35.215
One crucifiction is better than everyday

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:41.370
Only Mother can do this work
With such a power of love

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:45.943
Anything can be worked out with her power of love

00:31:45.975 --> 00:31:52.600
She holds everything with so much love
that children don't mind correcting

00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:00.040
For instance when trouble comes only mother
knows how to handle it and scold later

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:05.260
Because children understands mother's love
and it is for them

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:12.970
With father children may react
but not with mother's love without expectation

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:22.105
She doesn't want anything but her children to be good
and get all my powers, all good in me

00:32:22.105 --> 00:32:27.165
If mother feels it children will be fine

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:34.640
But some mothers are very interfering
and get involved in everything

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.970
She comes always in front
while husband is at the back

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.970
Children will be spoiled by it

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:50.043
Under such harmful environment children
can be very emotional

00:32:50.043 --> 00:32:55.195
So woman should be behind
and make her husband in front

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.880
Whatever husbands do
wifes must help him behind

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:09.270
The source of his power is wife
Then how pure and hard-working she should be

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:16.100
I put everything on woman
because I know you have great powers inside

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:21.090
Look at me as a Mother
I must make everyone saints

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:26.020
Curing many diseases
to make people saints

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:31.170
Did anyone do this job?
Only Ahilya was saved

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.435
Jesus saved 21 people

00:33:34.435 --> 00:33:37.715
I must have saved 21000 now

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.745
Going around the world to do
everyone's job

00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:49.435
it's still going on but I don't feel
because of love

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:56.480
Maybe I should put bandhan
as I don't know what kind of people I meet

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.960
But as soon as people comes to me
I absorb all the problems

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:08.485
So love acts by itself
I know everything is done by love

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:15.463
I don't feel bad whatever happens
Only Mother can bear the pain

00:34:15.622 --> 00:34:24.040
So I want you to grow consistantly
without hurdles

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:32.500
Also men should help their wives fully
Understand and respect them

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:41.811
Until the 2 wheels gets balanced
the chariot doesn't go forward

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:49.625
They both should be the same but
one on the left and the other on the right

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:54.510
It won't work if you change it

00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:07.935
It is moving and working
because they are the same but unique

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:22.910
Same in the sense of height
length and width but they work differently

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:27.960
It's the same in our life

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:39.940
Shri Rama didn't think
only about husband and wife

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:45.630
Didn't think only about children and family

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:54.645
Also of brother, sister, mother, father
and everyone as a normal human being

00:35:54.645 --> 00:36:01.195
After he thought about society

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.380
About public, state and country

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:18.730
As a human being he has shown
human ideals in his activities

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:28.960
The person who loved his wife so much
knew she was pure and hed left her

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:40.755
Now people give so much to their own wife
but they never give to poor people

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:46.645
Otherwise they give to their relatives
It's a disease among politicians

00:36:46.645 --> 00:36:56.415
But the one who has wife who is sakshat
devi had to leave her

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:04.980
We must understand it's attachment
to relatives and possessions

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:12.300
In west marriage relation wasn't alright
but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything

00:37:12.325 --> 00:37:20.188
Here leaders had to leave
because their wives were not alright

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.770
Their attention got spoiled
by wife's preaching

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.019
At least five yogi left
because of their wives

00:37:29.485 --> 00:37:40.510
Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga
and their role in it

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:46.250
In this case husbands shouldn't
agree with their wives at all

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:52.210
Tell her that “You talk and move
too much, Be quiet"

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.630
You are useless
Your chakras are not alright

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.755
She will be alright only in this way

00:38:00.755 --> 00:38:07.060
But instead you blame yourself
and obey your wife?

00:38:07.085 --> 00:38:10.155
If she tells you to steal, you do it?

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:18.670
Even after Sahaja Yoga you still
have some catches to take care

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:29.670
On the occasion of Shri Rama
Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.150
And how he was busy at his service

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:46.145
He was aware that his life is
for serving Shri Rama

00:38:46.145 --> 00:38:53.325
We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga

00:38:53.350 --> 00:39:00.090
But it doesn't mean you cook food for
me which I don't eat

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:06.425
You trouble me cooking so much
this and that

00:39:06.425 --> 00:39:12.425
Don't keep on serving someone forcefully

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:18.610
What we need is zeal to serve (Sewa)

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.105
Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama

00:39:22.105 --> 00:39:25.508
Delhi people kept on
serving food so much

00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:31.360
that I had to tell them
I wouln't come if you don't stop

00:39:31.527 --> 00:39:35.310
Do what you have to do

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.572
It's bad to force someone to eat

00:39:39.572 --> 00:39:43.195
serving one after another

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.260
I don't need anything
and I am tired

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:55.039
I told you only flowers
But don't spend too much also

00:39:55.125 --> 00:40:02.725
A lot of flowers make me
worry sometimes

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:11.027
Please your Mother in balance
She is a simple woman who don't understand these

00:40:11.485 --> 00:40:19.055
We have to learn that zeal to serve is
from Hanuman ji

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:24.020
There is no special service for me

00:40:24.045 --> 00:40:31.135
But if you want to serve me
serve to Sahaj Yoga

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.340
Serving to Sahaja Yoga is
serving to me

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.920
How many realisation have you given

00:40:40.945 --> 00:40:44.444
How many did you transform and inspire

00:40:44.563 --> 00:40:50.900
But if you say to new people
they have bhoot, they just leave

00:40:50.925 --> 00:41:01.760
One gentleman was told he has
3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.560
he was told number of bhoots even

00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:13.344
he believed it because the Yogi
was an authority in the local area

00:41:13.501 --> 00:41:17.860
I don't know who
but the person left

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.300
So what we have to learn
from Hanuman is the zeal

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.180
" Ram kaj karne ko tatpar"
(eager to do Ram's work)

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.720
What is our work?
My work is sahaj yoga

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.070
My work is sahaj yoga
To raise kundalini

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.813
To make people peaceful and lovable
talking about love

00:41:41.838 --> 00:41:55.270
Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras
Make them understand

00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:02.480
Doesn't mean you start giving lecture
Some people started to give so much lecture

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.140
I had to tell them to stop
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:16.030
Only long lectures
No time for Mother's talk and Aarti

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.945
He said he just can't stop

00:42:20.945 --> 00:42:25.275
He doesn't know why
"How can I fix it?"

00:42:25.275 --> 00:42:28.765
"You put supari (spice) in your mouth"

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:33.760
Then "How much?"

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.620
"It depends on the size of your mouth"

00:42:37.645 --> 00:42:43.450
"You don't know it even then
how come you talk aobut Sahaja Yoga"

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.950
you don't know it even

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.500
People like giving lecture

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:56.120
Get on a stage and won't leave a mic

00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:02.100
Once with mic they cant't leave
It's a new disease

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:08.850
So you must understand
why to give lecture

00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:17.800
There are so many Mother's talk
you can put a tape or video in every program

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:30.670
After people can write question on paper
And ask them to bring it next program

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.970
If there are someone
who is sick or in trouble

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:41.780
Now there is a Yogi
He comes to cure in Calcutta

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:49.230
Now he was called to Russia

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.572
One person is running like
Hanuman all over to cure

00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:58.957
You all can cure
All women can do

00:43:58.982 --> 00:44:02.364
All men also
But nobody tries

00:44:02.618 --> 00:44:06.920
By giving lecture how many were cured?

00:44:07.046 --> 00:44:08.555
I don't know why only one in India

00:44:08.555 --> 00:44:09.055
don't know what's the matter
that till now there is only one man in India
who can cure people

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:20.160
In London there are 15~20 people
who can cure and in France also

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:26.502
One should learn working on people
like giving bandhan

00:44:26.558 --> 00:44:37.300
No need to invite someone from abroad
Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:42.275
How do you work on others
if you can't cure even yourself

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:48.315
Everybody has got
all the power to cure anyone

00:44:48.315 --> 00:44:52.200
Learn to become masters

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.170
Instead of inviting someone
They should go out to cure

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:02.693
Just have some courage to work
Nothing will happen

00:45:02.892 --> 00:45:12.512
By working, you become deeper like
a tree grows deeper as it expands

00:45:12.978 --> 00:45:20.925
Sahaja Yogis are very much different
from Incarnations

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:26.010
They have never worked in society before

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:30.440
Nobody had the power for a mass

00:45:30.465 --> 00:45:36.325
Only one to one
Like King Janaka to Nachiketa

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:45.585
But now you all have it
Just grow it, that's all

00:45:45.585 --> 00:45:52.470
Cure yourself and others
Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything

00:45:52.525 --> 00:45:58.190
But still your attention is wondering
What are you running after?

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:04.838
You still don't understand it
Sahaja Yoga is just blessing

00:46:04.918 --> 00:46:09.190
You won't be in short of anything

00:46:09.215 --> 00:46:14.590
Just work for sahaja Yoga
Even if you don't work you will be blessed

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:20.720
Business or promotion,
this and that

00:46:20.745 --> 00:46:27.563
Everyone is blessed and
nothing to give up

00:46:27.588 --> 00:46:33.243
Otherwise in time of freedom fight

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:39.486
we were tortured
Lied on ice, got electric shocks

00:46:39.525 --> 00:46:44.015
My parents went to jail
Our house was sold

00:46:44.015 --> 00:46:51.780
Lived in a hut... had to sacrifice a lot
And you don't have to do it

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:56.750
But not only recieving
You have to give

00:46:56.756 --> 00:47:04.088
If one door is open so should be the other one
Only one doesn't work

00:47:04.107 --> 00:47:10.816
Everyone reports me
about blessings they got

00:47:12.055 --> 00:47:19.010
We must see what we have done for others

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:31.520
But there are many fights for leadership
It's all mother's play

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:35.670
You will know it when you will fall from there

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:42.399
Specially women shouldn't get involved
They fall very soon

00:47:42.424 --> 00:47:47.390
And men should know
there is nothing like ministers

00:47:47.469 --> 00:47:51.025
This is Mother's play
Don't get involved in

00:47:51.025 --> 00:47:59.037
Why I call a leader? It's a play
There are no leaders

00:47:59.124 --> 00:48:07.780
It's just a test if you have ego
If you have, you are gone

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:14.550
It will be shown immediately
In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed

00:48:14.582 --> 00:48:19.453
Even if I say something
it shows on the faces

00:48:19.469 --> 00:48:27.192
Once some leaders came and
confessed their mistakes

00:48:27.248 --> 00:48:36.860
They have more responsibilities to be
better, sweet, humble and loving

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.250
and become close and sharing with everyone

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:50.320
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama
we must understand what he had showen

00:48:50.345 --> 00:48:56.272
Only a bit of it would please our Mother

00:48:56.310 --> 00:49:07.445
He was in exile for a long time in Jungle
Walked barefeet, worked so hard

00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:11.395
Just to obey his father

00:49:11.395 --> 00:49:15.405
Now to obey me
you don't need to go into exile

00:49:15.405 --> 00:49:20.690
Not barefeet, nor starving nothing
All are there for you

00:49:20.806 --> 00:49:27.290
But you must know how to cure people
in Sahaja Yoga

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.770
everything about sahaj yoga

00:49:30.797 --> 00:49:35.455
and mostly about love

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:43.240
it's nothing but power of love
Everybody will be benefited

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:49.770
This is not only for special people

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:56.983
This is not only for one country
but for the whole world

00:49:57.445 --> 00:50:06.290
Watch how your attention is
If it's disturbed we should correct it

00:50:06.367 --> 00:50:13.480
Put the power of spirit in it
Do everything with concentration

00:50:13.584 --> 00:50:20.123
And devotion and love will
make you deep

00:50:20.123 --> 00:50:27.013
Otherwise there is lots of rubbish

00:50:27.038 --> 00:50:34.939
If you wish to stay like rubbish
you know where it goes at the end

00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:39.770
If you want to feel you are
specially good capable of anything

00:50:39.985 --> 00:50:45.969
First humility, not only towards me
but everyone

00:50:46.136 --> 00:50:58.848
Talk humbly with love and show that
people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga

00:50:58.951 --> 00:51:01.445
to spread fragrance everywhere

00:51:01.445 --> 00:51:10.050
People will tell me you are wonderful
if you will do it in that way

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:15.171
One day you too will be called as
Maryada Purushottama

00:51:15.251 --> 00:51:21.232
You are the temple of Rama
so have it within yourself

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:27.319
Perform puja to it
Take care of your self-esteem

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:36.808
Take the benefit of self-realization
inside yourself

00:51:36.855 --> 00:51:41.440
You must have respect and devotion to it

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:49.738
"Now we are realized"
"How can we do wrong, we are yogi"

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:56.430
Soon you will have blessings
immediately

00:51:56.430 --> 00:52:02.568
As I am called Rokra devi, you will get
blessing as soon as you assert it

00:52:02.814 --> 00:52:12.220
Everyone is getting blessed with it
give it back to the world

00:52:12.245 --> 00:52:25.955
Shri Rama used all his powers for the
benevolence of people to show the ideal

00:52:25.955 --> 00:52:33.855
You will be surprised to achieve so high
when the time comes

00:52:33.865 --> 00:52:41.875
You won't have any disease and
all bad habits will be dropped

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:50.085
You will eat, talk and watch
as much as you need

00:52:50.133 --> 00:53:02.462
You will watch your mind
for introspection

00:53:02.494 --> 00:53:13.248
"Where is my mind going?"
"I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it"

00:53:14.168 --> 00:53:18.046
By doing so
you will be in meditation

00:53:18.071 --> 00:53:24.403
Your kundalini will be satisfied
and give you blessings

00:53:24.428 --> 00:53:27.408
You say,
"Mother what a blessing"

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:32.283
But you have to jump into it
Only then will you know it

00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:36.755
Till then you need to work hard

00:53:36.755 --> 00:53:42.835
Shri Rama was born
at midnight so let's have puja late

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:49.922
Shri Rama Puja is not
a specially long one

00:53:50.103 --> 00:54:01.834
As he is in a human form
he is humanity within us

00:54:02.086 --> 00:54:14.595
by which we understand our intellect
and our thoughts get changed

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:21.890
Shri Rama is that
Through him we can change our thoughts

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:28.060
Our nature can change
Because he is our ideal

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:35.481
After achieving his ideals we reach another
because he was human ideal

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:41.710
It is great that God came to this world
in a human form to became our ideal

00:54:41.741 --> 00:54:51.515
He has gone through all the hardships
to show us strength to keep Dharma

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:56.223
That is Vishwa Dharma
and the state of yoga

00:54:56.834 --> 00:55:00.850
May God bless you all
