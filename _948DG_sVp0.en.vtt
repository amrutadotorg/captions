WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:06.640
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

00:06.650 --> 00:08.700
everybody has said

00:08.710 --> 00:14.610
Mother please tell us about Shri Ram

00:14.620 --> 00:23.670
As you know that Shri Rama has taken
a very important place in our chakras

00:23.680 --> 00:31.010
He is sitting on our right heart

00:31.020 --> 00:38.910
Shri Rama has taken a place of a father

00:38.920 --> 00:54.847
so lack of father's duty and love
can cause a catch of this chakra

00:57.290 --> 01:02.513
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand
that Rama and all other gods

01:02.580 --> 01:09.440
came on earth with different power (shakti),

01:09.450 --> 01:17.530
they came to do their jobs

01:17.571 --> 01:22.356
In the sense Shri Rama has a special job

01:24.870 --> 01:30.730
Socrates has said
benevolent king has to come

01:30.740 --> 01:35.212
For that Shri Rama came

01:36.470 --> 01:41.350
Shri Rama came in complete human form

01:41.360 --> 01:44.700
He even forgot that

01:44.710 --> 01:49.410
he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu
He was made to be forgotten

01:49.420 --> 01:59.420
But he was Purushottam on earth
(perfect human being)

01:59.430 --> 02:08.150
you all must have heard of
his qualities and his childhood

02:08.160 --> 02:15.686
In Sahaja yoga
when we worship any god

02:17.380 --> 02:30.800
what quality we gain from them

02:30.810 --> 02:34.440
which qualities we will receive?

02:34.450 --> 02:36.900
Shri Rama has many

02:36.910 --> 02:47.910
One that he was ideal
another that he is a king

02:47.920 --> 02:53.030
he kept his people higher than himself

02:53.040 --> 02:58.000
than his wife and children

02:58.010 --> 03:06.290
If politicians today

03:06.300 --> 03:10.840
understand this point

03:10.850 --> 03:14.940
they wouldn't be called selfish

03:14.950 --> 03:17.130
they wouldn't be selfish

03:17.140 --> 03:19.480
would be follower of Dharma.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.720
Nobody has followed

03:21.730 --> 03:28.720
Shri Rama as a role model
till today

03:28.730 --> 03:31.680
By singing his bhajans

03:31.690 --> 03:38.901
or building an institutions and temples
in his name

03:39.234 --> 03:44.380
Shri Rama come to you?

03:44.390 --> 03:48.120
Do you get his light in your life?

03:48.177 --> 03:57.416
Only sahaj yogi can bring the light
of Shri Rama into the attention

03:59.147 --> 04:02.306
He is totally beyond

04:02.340 --> 04:07.105
Basically all the deities are
free from papas and punyas

04:07.130 --> 04:13.285
so called sins
they never sin

04:13.295 --> 04:16.645
Shri Krishna killed many people

04:16.772 --> 04:20.933
Shri Rama killed Ravana

04:20.943 --> 04:25.895
It can be a sin in worldly sense

04:25.920 --> 04:29.005
but not in the eyes of god

04:29.307 --> 04:41.240
As they destroy and remove evils
they have rights to do anything

04:41.265 --> 04:49.350
When Devi slayed Rakshas
she has committed a sin?

04:49.360 --> 04:58.899
Their work is to destroy the
rakshas and protect the saints

05:01.770 --> 05:10.465
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is
the most important

05:10.465 --> 05:14.336
she was cursed by her husband

05:14.953 --> 05:19.902
In those times if any women
goes out of dharma

05:19.927 --> 05:26.215
and if her husband is high saint
he could curse

05:27.565 --> 05:32.075
But Ahillya was blamed falsely

05:32.107 --> 05:37.481
And she was made into stone falsely

05:37.760 --> 05:42.710
So shri Rama saved Ahilya

05:42.720 --> 05:55.779
Especially his quality to have only one wife

05:56.263 --> 06:01.103
his love to one wife must be understood

06:02.730 --> 06:09.185
Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi
she herself is a Goddess

06:09.185 --> 06:18.745
But as a Human he never looked
at any other women but his wife

06:18.770 --> 06:24.269
When we talk about Rama
we should have the husband pure

06:24.507 --> 06:28.433
To worships shri Rama

06:28.706 --> 06:38.825
Women should have the same faith
in husbands as Sitaji used to

06:38.931 --> 06:45.103
Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram
who believed one wife

06:45.128 --> 06:48.055
Not difficult for sahaja yogis

06:48.080 --> 06:53.030
Women should be respected
Have respect for wifes

06:53.040 --> 06:57.040
When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

06:57.050 --> 07:02.705
Shri Rama felt his duty
to rescue her

07:02.705 --> 07:10.330
But in his kingdom
he was so just that

07:10.340 --> 07:16.670
For people he left her
after spending so many years to rescue

07:16.680 --> 07:22.820
As Sitaji herself a Devi
so there's no effect

07:22.830 --> 07:26.706
So Shri Rama did it

07:26.785 --> 07:33.227
to keep the benevolence
of public opinion

07:33.346 --> 07:37.340
that society wouln't accpect the women

07:37.365 --> 07:43.330
who are questioned.

07:44.417 --> 07:49.788
Although she is a Devi
Pure and Nirmala

07:49.813 --> 07:54.216
Later that
Sita also left him somehow

07:54.420 --> 08:00.915
She left him as a woman
and Shri Rama as a man

08:00.940 --> 08:09.234
Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth
and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

08:09.553 --> 08:16.318
Their life is very eventful
and full of Miracles

08:16.485 --> 08:25.817
You see how shri Sita and Rama
have good attitude and are faithful each other

08:25.850 --> 08:31.895
Even if she was left
Sita thought it her duty

08:31.895 --> 08:37.985
She never complained
or talked ill of him

08:38.010 --> 08:44.467
And effortlessly
she has raised her children

08:45.195 --> 08:50.632
Shri Rama's children are
called Luv and Kush

08:50.675 --> 08:59.534
They came as devotees
and we can see them as disciples

08:59.730 --> 09:02.770
They represents Shisya (disciples)

09:02.780 --> 09:10.770
the power of Shisya
so we can be disciple of someone

09:10.780 --> 09:16.800
As disciples they learned archery
when they were small

09:16.810 --> 09:24.218
And learned Ramayana
and got proficiency in the music

09:24.590 --> 09:32.115
Showing the disciples must surrender completely
to the Guru

09:32.125 --> 09:36.745
We also have a disciples in us

09:36.770 --> 09:44.228
They were  completely surrendered to
the Mother who is Shakti

09:44.510 --> 09:50.180
Even they were about to fight
against Shri Rama

09:50.205 --> 09:53.680
they kept Mother highest in the world

09:53.680 --> 10:00.350
The mother cared them
and made them completely dharmic

10:00.360 --> 10:03.270
It was her first duty

10:03.280 --> 10:08.330
Not like today wives just cry
"my husband left me"

10:08.340 --> 10:14.323
But with husband they fight always
and if he leaves they will cry

10:14.510 --> 10:23.117
He has left no problem
I have children, I will care for them

10:23.150 --> 10:28.110
they will get all they need

10:28.120 --> 10:37.890
Sitaj's life was special
with bravery and strength

10:37.900 --> 10:40.810
Every woman must have it

10:40.820 --> 10:45.880
Even if you are separated with your
husband or far away

10:45.890 --> 10:53.680
there shouldn't be any loss
or shortage for children

10:53.825 --> 10:59.353
Because her duty
is the most important thing

10:59.550 --> 11:02.698
We shouldn't give up
most important thing

11:02.884 --> 11:09.455
In sahaja yoga
all women should get this power

11:10.250 --> 11:14.650
Shri Rama's life was
very pure and Nirmal

11:14.660 --> 11:17.720
he gave up everything
for his wife

11:18.640 --> 11:30.000
His wife had gone, he had to live alone
and he had to leave her

11:30.010 --> 11:34.360
He gave up all the comforts of the life

11:34.370 --> 11:41.560
You know he used to sleep
on grass, on floor and walked barefeet

11:41.570 --> 11:45.156
and wear clothes like saints

11:45.960 --> 11:48.930
All these are not stories
it's a fact

11:48.940 --> 11:57.030
In India many people used to have
high standard life

11:57.040 --> 12:00.850
and they have never thought about
small and low level things

12:00.860 --> 12:09.946
But all these ideals of our country
have beccome fake

12:09.971 --> 12:16.765
By singing bhajans to Ram
we think we are done

12:16.765 --> 12:19.895
we have got a kind of hypocracy

12:20.181 --> 12:23.727
In countries without
these ideals

12:23.752 --> 12:29.095
people try to become the ideals
correcting themselves

12:29.151 --> 12:33.886
If you have the ideal in front of us

12:33.940 --> 12:38.240
you don't  become Shri Rama or Krishna

12:38.250 --> 12:40.780
or you have anything to do with them

12:40.790 --> 12:43.110
We feel like that

12:43.120 --> 12:49.733
But if we have Shri Rama inside
his light can be in our attention

12:49.788 --> 12:52.828
Let's understand

12:52.987 --> 12:59.371
the circumstances when
Shri Rama came on earth

12:59.499 --> 13:01.993
Sahaja Yogi must understand

13:02.026 --> 13:12.000
If we get Shri Rama's state
All our political problems will go

13:12.010 --> 13:17.083
when we decide to
become like shri Rama

13:32.573 --> 13:36.300
Then everyone becomes good

13:36.310 --> 13:47.830
firstly dharma, success and education
then the ideals

13:47.840 --> 13:54.970
for that he made his life very idealistic

13:54.980 --> 14:01.950
When someone tells you something
but he doesn't do it himself

14:01.960 --> 14:06.532
Then how can you trust him and get his quality

14:06.572 --> 14:10.790
There are many people who say
we believe in this and that

14:10.800 --> 14:13.760
But they are opposite

14:13.770 --> 14:22.694
Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician
and they have many wives, impossible

14:23.100 --> 14:28.390
What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life?

14:28.540 --> 14:33.871
we have to bring the light of god
in our attention

14:34.189 --> 14:39.555
We must see and behave as Shri Rama

14:39.873 --> 14:47.198
What would Shri Rama or Sita do
in this situation

14:47.208 --> 14:52.875
What would Sita ji say?

14:52.900 --> 14:57.154
How would Sita behave?
She is also Gruhlaxmi

14:57.265 --> 15:02.780
As you know Sitaji took many births

15:02.790 --> 15:09.350
Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi

15:09.375 --> 15:16.535
She was humbly in the house but all
dharma was done by her power

15:16.535 --> 15:22.845
Not necessary for her to go out
and give big lectures

15:22.870 --> 15:32.730
You can do that work at home
with children relatives and friends

15:32.755 --> 15:37.620
you can spread sahaja Yoga at the house

15:37.620 --> 15:41.850
After getting all of it
you can go out to society

15:41.860 --> 15:52.340
But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first

15:52.350 --> 15:56.600
First thing of the purity is
motherhood and love

15:56.610 --> 16:03.230
When she was in exile never complained
that my husband doesn't earn

16:03.240 --> 16:08.445
He doesn't do this
he doesn't buy this and that

16:08.445 --> 16:13.500
If he is in jungle so I am
What he will eat I wil

16:13.525 --> 16:18.307
I don't eat before him
I serve him first

16:18.457 --> 16:22.671
and  brother in law then I will eat

16:22.751 --> 16:36.750
Nowadays women think there is
much pressure of the work But it is not

16:37.148 --> 16:43.706
A woman is like earth element
she can absorb

16:43.937 --> 16:48.652
So many are given by the earth

16:48.677 --> 16:53.460
In the same way
women are like the earth

16:53.485 --> 16:58.511
We have got so many powers
that we can take everything inside

16:58.591 --> 17:04.892
and shower the rain of love
God has given us the power

17:04.931 --> 17:14.842
For example this fan is moving
Which one is greater, the power or fan?

17:16.500 --> 17:23.230
If you think fan is greater as  it's moving
Then it's wrong

17:23.230 --> 17:27.570
Women are ocean of shakti

17:27.595 --> 17:32.445
With that support Men does their work

17:32.470 --> 17:39.709
They are potential and kinetic
Women are potential and men are kinetic

17:39.812 --> 17:45.025
But if you start running like them

17:45.025 --> 17:48.375
It's not good
No need for women

17:48.400 --> 17:58.056
Each one is unique but equally important
But women can be good for both

17:58.136 --> 18:02.695
When the time comes
women can be more productive

18:02.720 --> 18:09.230
In Maharashtra
there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai

18:09.240 --> 18:13.640
She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji

18:13.650 --> 18:18.070
Only she could defeat Aurangzeb

18:18.080 --> 18:21.175
Her grave was built

18:21.175 --> 18:34.789
You must understand women can keep all her
power within her to become ferocious

18:34.911 --> 18:47.210
But  if she waste her powers in
fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things

18:47.220 --> 18:50.340
then her power would be gone

18:50.350 --> 18:58.640
Women are so powerful that
she can work more than men if she want

18:58.650 --> 19:02.117
But first of all
she must respect her powers

19:02.134 --> 19:08.303
by scattering and wasting she becomes powerless

19:08.335 --> 19:10.954
this kind of woman is not good

19:11.168 --> 19:18.214
Women's job is very important and full of dignity

19:18.333 --> 19:22.901
Women should be very modest and very wise

19:23.005 --> 19:27.795
Let Men use bad words but women cannot

19:27.992 --> 19:34.459
Men can argue and would fight
let them do but not Women

19:34.499 --> 19:42.483
Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people

19:42.824 --> 19:50.170
She is like shield not like sword
and sword cannot be shield

19:50.180 --> 19:57.120
Shield is greater than sword
as shield can bear the sword

19:57.145 --> 20:01.590
Sword can be broken
but not shield

20:01.590 --> 20:10.210
So her most important power is humility

20:10.220 --> 20:14.220
With humility comes all the powers

20:14.230 --> 20:19.050
It's not difficult for sahaj yogis
not at all

20:19.060 --> 20:23.120
I see many sahaja yoginis chat a lot

20:23.130 --> 20:26.820
anywhere they will chat with men

20:26.830 --> 20:31.110
"Mother help me" "what happened"

20:31.120 --> 20:35.670
"The lady talks a lot please help me"

20:35.680 --> 20:38.595
"I am tired of her"

20:38.605 --> 20:43.851
There isn't much to talk with men
What's the need?

20:44.091 --> 20:47.453
Among women also

20:47.553 --> 20:53.115
In sahaja yoga men study more

20:53.115 --> 20:55.475
About Sahaja Yoga and the chakras

20:55.500 --> 21:03.370
Which chakra is driving people and is catching?

21:03.380 --> 21:07.260
Man knows all
women would be left behind

21:07.270 --> 21:09.172
Women must learn

21:09.322 --> 21:15.735
For men Shri Rama is our ideal

21:15.760 --> 21:21.435
In this sense Muslims are amazing

21:21.440 --> 21:24.865
I don't want to say bad things

21:24.890 --> 21:31.550
Say if you go to Riyad
no  Muslim will see you

21:31.560 --> 21:36.180
they will respect women
If women are crossing the street

21:36.190 --> 21:40.350
they will stop the car
respecting women

21:40.360 --> 21:45.220
But here it's opposite
I don't know why

21:45.230 --> 21:49.780
we see women with some intention

21:49.790 --> 21:54.870
Seeing every woman
they will break the neck

21:54.880 --> 21:59.390
It's a big sin to see every woman

21:59.409 --> 22:03.289
In sahaja yoga it's prohibited completely

22:03.314 --> 22:08.585
Firstly you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga

22:08.610 --> 22:13.630
Otherwise you may become blind

22:13.640 --> 22:17.740
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes

22:17.765 --> 22:22.115
While talking eyes are wandering
women too

22:22.140 --> 22:27.430
The biggest loss is your attention

22:27.440 --> 22:30.670
Your attention goes here and there

22:30.695 --> 22:35.055
then what's the use of self-realization

22:35.065 --> 22:41.390
Without concentration Chitta can't be active

22:41.400 --> 22:46.580
Concentration must be obtained

22:46.613 --> 22:51.253
In the west the disease is
more common among men

22:51.285 --> 22:57.185
Western yogis are not alike
They know it's bad

22:57.290 --> 23:01.300
They asked me the solution

23:01.310 --> 23:10.815
Look at only ground and up to 3 feets
you don't have to see above

23:10.840 --> 23:19.210
Look at the ground
Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad

23:19.220 --> 23:29.380
You see all good things, flowers and children
Nothing to see above

23:29.390 --> 23:32.920
So, that's how you should control your chitta

23:32.920 --> 23:38.780
Shri Rama didn't need it
If you have a respect to shri Rama

23:38.805 --> 23:43.505
You must control your chitta like him

23:43.530 --> 23:54.778
Tell your wife you respect her as shakti
But she has to deserve it

23:54.888 --> 23:59.155
"Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata"

23:59.180 --> 24:09.994
"Where women are respected resides
god" But they have to be respectable

24:10.280 --> 24:13.788
Please sit down

24:14.002 --> 24:18.780
Don't move during Puja

24:18.780 --> 24:24.520
If the woman is worshipable
"Pujyante" means "worshipable"

24:24.520 --> 24:32.670
Who like to worship a bad woman
cruel Rakshasi?

24:32.670 --> 24:40.030
Those who are worshpable should be worshipped
There resides gods

24:40.030 --> 24:44.936
Firstly they are mothers of children

24:44.961 --> 24:49.984
If husband scolds wife in front of children

24:50.020 --> 24:54.540
then children will never respect mother

24:54.565 --> 24:58.675
It's prime minister and deputy minister

24:58.700 --> 25:01.760
Women shouldn't insult her husband too

25:01.760 --> 25:09.710
Power goes to children from father

25:09.750 --> 25:18.167
Without this basic understanding
they fight to take control

25:18.245 --> 25:22.690
If woman knows handling of man
there won't be any fights

25:22.715 --> 25:28.970
Handling men is very easy
as they are just like children

25:28.970 --> 25:34.655
they are innocent like children

25:34.655 --> 25:38.295
By talking nonsense
you can't handle them

25:38.320 --> 25:41.564
You must forgive them as children

25:41.775 --> 25:45.355
If they fight outside
they get troubled

25:45.380 --> 25:48.820
They can get angry only to wife

25:48.845 --> 25:51.905
Getting angry at home is OK

25:51.930 --> 26:01.067
Until you get this feeling, you cannot have
mutual understanding, love and joy

26:01.242 --> 26:07.162
Men also should care for wife's needs

26:07.187 --> 26:19.145
if wife is wrong, husband has duty to say no
"It's wrong, I won't do this"

26:19.145 --> 26:25.565
But no need to fight on small things
It doesn't look good as sahaja yogis

26:25.590 --> 26:29.320
I am surprised that
Sahaja couples fight each other

26:29.320 --> 26:35.250
They come to complain about each other

26:35.275 --> 26:44.475
How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully
while I'm talking about peace to the whole world

26:44.500 --> 26:47.760
It won't work out if you are fighting like that

26:47.760 --> 26:55.919
Husband has to have complete
understanding of his wife first

26:55.990 --> 27:04.570
And know that all the other women
are like your sisters and mothers

27:04.595 --> 27:09.375
If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga
then there's no way out

27:09.375 --> 27:14.405
There was a swiss man
not a Sahaja Yogi

27:14.405 --> 27:20.310
Not Indian
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini

27:20.310 --> 27:27.155
Girl's husband had wandering
eyes but came to sahaja yoga

27:27.180 --> 27:35.178
They both came to Sahaja Yoga
The girl is very good but he went on doing it

27:35.297 --> 27:40.480
The non-yogi father told her to leave him

27:40.480 --> 27:46.840
"Even after sahaja yoga if he can't be cleansed
then leave him"

27:46.840 --> 27:54.980
"He is not a Sahaja Yogi don't relate with him"

27:54.990 --> 28:04.020
Even Non-Sahaja Yogi can understand
that the person can't be cleansed

28:04.020 --> 28:10.830
He doesn't have stable attention
then it is bad

28:10.830 --> 28:18.390
Our culture is that men and women
must be brother and sister

28:18.390 --> 28:25.350
But I see a talkative woman
just go to talk to men

28:25.350 --> 28:34.060
I don't understand it
They don't sit with other ladies but with men

28:34.060 --> 28:39.735
Same with men just start chatting with women

28:39.735 --> 28:49.905
Even with maid or anyone
just start talking, no self-esteem

28:49.930 --> 28:57.350
We think it's masculinity but Shri Rama is
the perfect man who is highest

28:57.360 --> 29:03.350
But the one at the bottom
think they are perfect

29:03.350 --> 29:08.630
Where is perfection?
Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil

29:08.640 --> 29:12.280
If you believe in Shri Rama
follow his ideal

29:12.280 --> 29:17.716
Therefore children and women
are getting spoiled

29:17.755 --> 29:23.230
But still Indian women maintained
good culture here

29:23.230 --> 29:33.050
If they were like Americans what it would have been
Men are fixed in terrible condition there

29:33.050 --> 29:46.650
After 2-3 marriages Men becomes
bunkrupt but women make a palace

29:46.650 --> 29:50.680
It's bad in America
Children are running away from home

29:50.680 --> 29:59.820
Indian woman manage their house
husband and children

29:59.820 --> 30:05.695
But it's changing
They think the same like husbands

30:05.720 --> 30:11.120
If he runs away with 10 women
then we go with 15 men

30:11.120 --> 30:16.970
If he is going to hell then I go before him

30:16.970 --> 30:22.305
Women shouldn't do it
The base of dharma is in woman's hand

30:22.305 --> 30:29.925
Woman must manage husband dharmic
making him understand

30:29.950 --> 30:35.527
This is the biggest duty and power
of woman to be Dharmaic

30:35.552 --> 30:43.190
Biggest dharma is forgiveness
Without it nothing works out

30:43.190 --> 30:48.440
First thing she must have forgiveness
Forgive children, husband

30:48.440 --> 30:52.900
give refuge to house servants
all are her duty

30:52.925 --> 31:03.521
This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do
neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus

31:03.713 --> 31:16.690
Rama would have killed everyone
who is useless, adharmic and flirt

31:16.690 --> 31:20.100
Don't know how many he would be finished

31:20.100 --> 31:25.710
Krishna would use his sudarshan
chakra and there would be a battle

31:25.720 --> 31:28.945
Christ would crucify himself

31:28.945 --> 31:35.215
One crucifiction is better than everyday

31:35.240 --> 31:41.370
Only Mother can do this work
With such a power of love

31:41.370 --> 31:45.943
Anything can be worked out with her power of love

31:45.975 --> 31:52.600
She holds everything with so much love
that children don't mind correcting

31:52.600 --> 32:00.040
For instance when trouble comes only mother
knows how to handle it and scold later

32:00.040 --> 32:05.260
Because children understands mother's love
and it is for them

32:05.260 --> 32:12.970
With father children may react
but not with mother's love without expectation

32:12.970 --> 32:22.105
She doesn't want anything but her children to be good
and get all my powers, all good in me

32:22.105 --> 32:27.165
If mother feels it children will be fine

32:27.190 --> 32:34.640
But some mothers are very interfering
and get involved in everything

32:34.640 --> 32:38.970
She comes always in front
while husband is at the back

32:38.980 --> 32:41.970
Children will be spoiled by it

32:41.970 --> 32:50.043
Under such harmful environment children
can be very emotional

32:50.043 --> 32:55.195
So woman should be behind
and make her husband in front

32:55.220 --> 32:59.880
Whatever husbands do
wifes must help him behind

32:59.880 --> 33:09.270
The source of his power is wife
Then how pure and hard-working she should be

33:09.270 --> 33:16.100
I put everything on woman
because I know you have great powers inside

33:16.110 --> 33:21.090
Look at me as a Mother
I must make everyone saints

33:21.090 --> 33:26.020
Curing many diseases
to make people saints

33:26.020 --> 33:31.170
Did anyone do this job?
Only Ahilya was saved

33:31.170 --> 33:34.435
Jesus saved 21 people

33:34.435 --> 33:37.715
I must have saved 21000 now

33:37.740 --> 33:42.745
Going around the world to do
everyone's job

33:42.745 --> 33:49.435
it's still going on but I don't feel
because of love

33:49.460 --> 33:56.480
Maybe I should put bandhan
as I don't know what kind of people I meet

33:56.480 --> 34:00.960
But as soon as people comes to me
I absorb all the problems

34:00.960 --> 34:08.485
So love acts by itself
I know everything is done by love

34:08.510 --> 34:15.463
I don't feel bad whatever happens
Only Mother can bear the pain

34:15.622 --> 34:24.040
So I want you to grow consistantly
without hurdles

34:24.050 --> 34:32.500
Also men should help their wives fully
Understand and respect them

34:32.510 --> 34:41.811
Until the 2 wheels gets balanced
the chariot doesn't go forward

34:43.110 --> 34:49.625
They both should be the same but
one on the left and the other on the right

34:50.090 --> 34:54.510
It won't work if you change it

34:54.510 --> 35:07.935
It is moving and working
because they are the same but unique

35:07.960 --> 35:22.910
Same in the sense of height
length and width but they work differently

35:22.910 --> 35:27.960
It's the same in our life

35:27.960 --> 35:39.940
Shri Rama didn't think
only about husband and wife

35:39.940 --> 35:45.630
Didn't think only about children and family

35:45.630 --> 35:54.645
Also of brother, sister, mother, father
and everyone as a normal human being

35:54.645 --> 36:01.195
After he thought about society

36:01.220 --> 36:07.380
About public, state and country

36:07.380 --> 36:18.730
As a human being he has shown
human ideals in his activities

36:18.730 --> 36:28.960
The person who loved his wife so much
knew she was pure and hed left her

36:28.960 --> 36:40.755
Now people give so much to their own wife
but they never give to poor people

36:40.780 --> 36:46.645
Otherwise they give to their relatives
It's a disease among politicians

36:46.645 --> 36:56.415
But the one who has wife who is sakshat
devi had to leave her

36:56.440 --> 37:04.980
We must understand it's attachment
to relatives and possessions

37:04.980 --> 37:12.300
In west marriage relation wasn't alright
but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything

37:12.325 --> 37:20.188
Here leaders had to leave
because their wives were not alright

37:20.330 --> 37:24.770
Their attention got spoiled
by wife's preaching

37:24.780 --> 37:29.019
At least five yogi left
because of their wives

37:29.485 --> 37:40.510
Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga
and their role in it

37:40.510 --> 37:46.250
In this case husbands shouldn't
agree with their wives at all

37:46.250 --> 37:52.210
Tell her that “You talk and move
too much, Be quiet"

37:52.210 --> 37:55.630
You are useless
Your chakras are not alright

37:55.640 --> 38:00.755
She will be alright only in this way

38:00.755 --> 38:07.060
But instead you blame yourself
and obey your wife?

38:07.085 --> 38:10.155
If she tells you to steal, you do it?

38:10.180 --> 38:18.670
Even after Sahaja Yoga you still
have some catches to take care

38:18.670 --> 38:29.670
On the occasion of Shri Rama
Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee

38:29.670 --> 38:34.150
And how he was busy at his service

38:34.150 --> 38:46.145
He was aware that his life is
for serving Shri Rama

38:46.145 --> 38:53.325
We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga

38:53.350 --> 39:00.090
But it doesn't mean you cook food for
me which I don't eat

39:00.090 --> 39:06.425
You trouble me cooking so much
this and that

39:06.425 --> 39:12.425
Don't keep on serving someone forcefully

39:12.450 --> 39:18.610
What we need is zeal to serve (Sewa)

39:18.620 --> 39:22.105
Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama

39:22.105 --> 39:25.508
Delhi people kept on
serving food so much

39:25.533 --> 39:31.360
that I had to tell them
I wouln't come if you don't stop

39:31.527 --> 39:35.310
Do what you have to do

39:35.310 --> 39:39.572
It's bad to force someone to eat

39:39.572 --> 39:43.195
serving one after another

39:43.220 --> 39:47.260
I don't need anything
and I am tired

39:47.270 --> 39:55.039
I told you only flowers
But don't spend too much also

39:55.125 --> 40:02.725
A lot of flowers make me
worry sometimes

40:02.750 --> 40:11.027
Please your Mother in balance
She is a simple woman who don't understand these

40:11.485 --> 40:19.055
We have to learn that zeal to serve is
from Hanuman ji

40:19.080 --> 40:24.020
There is no special service for me

40:24.045 --> 40:31.135
But if you want to serve me
serve to Sahaj Yoga

40:32.840 --> 40:36.340
Serving to Sahaja Yoga is
serving to me

40:36.340 --> 40:40.920
How many realisation have you given

40:40.945 --> 40:44.444
How many did you transform and inspire

40:44.563 --> 40:50.900
But if you say to new people
they have bhoot, they just leave

40:50.925 --> 41:01.760
One gentleman was told he has
3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga

41:01.760 --> 41:06.560
he was told number of bhoots even

41:06.585 --> 41:13.344
he believed it because the Yogi
was an authority in the local area

41:13.501 --> 41:17.860
I don't know who
but the person left

41:17.860 --> 41:24.300
So what we have to learn
from Hanuman is the zeal

41:24.300 --> 41:28.180
" Ram kaj karne ko tatpar"
(eager to do Ram's work)

41:28.180 --> 41:32.720
What is our work?
My work is sahaj yoga

41:32.720 --> 41:37.070
My work is sahaj yoga
To raise kundalini

41:37.080 --> 41:41.813
To make people peaceful and lovable
talking about love

41:41.838 --> 41:55.270
Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras
Make them understand

41:55.280 --> 42:02.480
Doesn't mean you start giving lecture
Some people started to give so much lecture

42:02.480 --> 42:08.140
I had to tell them to stop
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished

42:08.150 --> 42:16.030
Only long lectures
No time for Mother's talk and Aarti

42:16.040 --> 42:20.945
He said he just can't stop

42:20.945 --> 42:25.275
He doesn't know why
"How can I fix it?"

42:25.275 --> 42:28.765
"You put supari (spice) in your mouth"

42:28.790 --> 42:33.760
Then "How much?"

42:33.760 --> 42:37.620
"It depends on the size of your mouth"

42:37.645 --> 42:43.450
"You don't know it even then
how come you talk aobut Sahaja Yoga"

42:43.450 --> 42:46.950
you don't know it even

42:46.950 --> 42:49.500
People like giving lecture

42:49.510 --> 42:56.120
Get on a stage and won't leave a mic

42:56.120 --> 43:02.100
Once with mic they cant't leave
It's a new disease

43:02.100 --> 43:08.850
So you must understand
why to give lecture

43:08.875 --> 43:17.800
There are so many Mother's talk
you can put a tape or video in every program

43:17.800 --> 43:30.670
After people can write question on paper
And ask them to bring it next program

43:30.670 --> 43:34.970
If there are someone
who is sick or in trouble

43:34.980 --> 43:41.780
Now there is a Yogi
He comes to cure in Calcutta

43:41.780 --> 43:49.230
Now he was called to Russia

43:49.240 --> 43:53.572
One person is running like
Hanuman all over to cure

43:53.597 --> 43:58.957
You all can cure
All women can do

43:58.982 --> 44:02.364
All men also
But nobody tries

44:02.618 --> 44:06.920
By giving lecture how many were cured?

44:07.046 --> 44:08.555
I don't know why only one in India

44:08.555 --> 44:09.055
don't know what's the matter
that till now there is only one man in India
who can cure people

44:12.710 --> 44:20.160
In London there are 15~20 people
who can cure and in France also

44:20.160 --> 44:26.502
One should learn working on people
like giving bandhan

44:26.558 --> 44:37.300
No need to invite someone from abroad
Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure

44:37.300 --> 44:42.275
How do you work on others
if you can't cure even yourself

44:42.300 --> 44:48.315
Everybody has got
all the power to cure anyone

44:48.315 --> 44:52.200
Learn to become masters

44:52.200 --> 44:57.170
Instead of inviting someone
They should go out to cure

44:57.210 --> 45:02.693
Just have some courage to work
Nothing will happen

45:02.892 --> 45:12.512
By working, you become deeper like
a tree grows deeper as it expands

45:12.978 --> 45:20.925
Sahaja Yogis are very much different
from Incarnations

45:20.950 --> 45:26.010
They have never worked in society before

45:26.010 --> 45:30.440
Nobody had the power for a mass

45:30.465 --> 45:36.325
Only one to one
Like King Janaka to Nachiketa

45:36.340 --> 45:45.585
But now you all have it
Just grow it, that's all

45:45.585 --> 45:52.470
Cure yourself and others
Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything

45:52.525 --> 45:58.190
But still your attention is wondering
What are you running after?

45:58.190 --> 46:04.838
You still don't understand it
Sahaja Yoga is just blessing

46:04.918 --> 46:09.190
You won't be in short of anything

46:09.215 --> 46:14.590
Just work for sahaja Yoga
Even if you don't work you will be blessed

46:14.590 --> 46:20.720
Business or promotion,
this and that

46:20.745 --> 46:27.563
Everyone is blessed and
nothing to give up

46:27.588 --> 46:33.243
Otherwise in time of freedom fight

46:33.430 --> 46:39.486
we were tortured
Lied on ice, got electric shocks

46:39.525 --> 46:44.015
My parents went to jail
Our house was sold

46:44.015 --> 46:51.780
Lived in a hut... had to sacrifice a lot
And you don't have to do it

46:51.780 --> 46:56.750
But not only recieving
You have to give

46:56.756 --> 47:04.088
If one door is open so should be the other one
Only one doesn't work

47:04.107 --> 47:10.816
Everyone reports me
about blessings they got

47:12.055 --> 47:19.010
We must see what we have done for others

47:19.060 --> 47:31.520
But there are many fights for leadership
It's all mother's play

47:31.530 --> 47:35.670
You will know it when you will fall from there

47:35.670 --> 47:42.399
Specially women shouldn't get involved
They fall very soon

47:42.424 --> 47:47.390
And men should know
there is nothing like ministers

47:47.469 --> 47:51.025
This is Mother's play
Don't get involved in

47:51.025 --> 47:59.037
Why I call a leader? It's a play
There are no leaders

47:59.124 --> 48:07.780
It's just a test if you have ego
If you have, you are gone

48:07.780 --> 48:14.550
It will be shown immediately
In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed

48:14.582 --> 48:19.453
Even if I say something
it shows on the faces

48:19.469 --> 48:27.192
Once some leaders came and
confessed their mistakes

48:27.248 --> 48:36.860
They have more responsibilities to be
better, sweet, humble and loving

48:36.860 --> 48:41.250
and become close and sharing with everyone

48:41.250 --> 48:50.320
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama
we must understand what he had showen

48:50.345 --> 48:56.272
Only a bit of it would please our Mother

48:56.310 --> 49:07.445
He was in exile for a long time in Jungle
Walked barefeet, worked so hard

49:07.445 --> 49:11.395
Just to obey his father

49:11.395 --> 49:15.405
Now to obey me
you don't need to go into exile

49:15.405 --> 49:20.690
Not barefeet, nor starving nothing
All are there for you

49:20.806 --> 49:27.290
But you must know how to cure people
in Sahaja Yoga

49:27.290 --> 49:30.770
everything about sahaj yoga

49:30.797 --> 49:35.455
and mostly about love

49:35.480 --> 49:43.240
it's nothing but power of love
Everybody will be benefited

49:43.240 --> 49:49.770
This is not only for special people

49:49.780 --> 49:56.983
This is not only for one country
but for the whole world

49:57.445 --> 50:06.290
Watch how your attention is
If it's disturbed we should correct it

50:06.367 --> 50:13.480
Put the power of spirit in it
Do everything with concentration

50:13.584 --> 50:20.123
And devotion and love will
make you deep

50:20.123 --> 50:27.013
Otherwise there is lots of rubbish

50:27.038 --> 50:34.939
If you wish to stay like rubbish
you know where it goes at the end

50:35.026 --> 50:39.770
If you want to feel you are
specially good capable of anything

50:39.985 --> 50:45.969
First humility, not only towards me
but everyone

50:46.136 --> 50:58.848
Talk humbly with love and show that
people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga

50:58.951 --> 51:01.445
to spread fragrance everywhere

51:01.445 --> 51:10.050
People will tell me you are wonderful
if you will do it in that way

51:10.050 --> 51:15.171
One day you too will be called as
Maryada Purushottama

51:15.251 --> 51:21.232
You are the temple of Rama
so have it within yourself

51:21.280 --> 51:27.319
Perform puja to it
Take care of your self-esteem

51:27.851 --> 51:36.808
Take the benefit of self-realization
inside yourself

51:36.855 --> 51:41.440
You must have respect and devotion to it

51:41.440 --> 51:49.738
"Now we are realized"
"How can we do wrong, we are yogi"

51:49.810 --> 51:56.430
Soon you will have blessings
immediately

51:56.430 --> 52:02.568
As I am called Rokra devi, you will get
blessing as soon as you assert it

52:02.814 --> 52:12.220
Everyone is getting blessed with it
give it back to the world

52:12.245 --> 52:25.955
Shri Rama used all his powers for the
benevolence of people to show the ideal

52:25.955 --> 52:33.855
You will be surprised to achieve so high
when the time comes

52:33.865 --> 52:41.875
You won't have any disease and
all bad habits will be dropped

52:41.900 --> 52:50.085
You will eat, talk and watch
as much as you need

52:50.133 --> 53:02.462
You will watch your mind
for introspection

53:02.494 --> 53:13.248
"Where is my mind going?"
"I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it"

53:14.168 --> 53:18.046
By doing so
you will be in meditation

53:18.071 --> 53:24.403
Your kundalini will be satisfied
and give you blessings

53:24.428 --> 53:27.408
You say,
"Mother what a blessing"

53:27.580 --> 53:32.283
But you have to jump into it
Only then will you know it

53:32.418 --> 53:36.755
Till then you need to work hard

53:36.755 --> 53:42.835
Shri Rama was born
at midnight so let's have puja late

53:42.860 --> 53:49.922
Shri Rama Puja is not
a specially long one

53:50.103 --> 54:01.834
As he is in a human form
he is humanity within us

54:02.086 --> 54:14.595
by which we understand our intellect
and our thoughts get changed

54:14.620 --> 54:21.890
Shri Rama is that
Through him we can change our thoughts

54:21.890 --> 54:28.060
Our nature can change
Because he is our ideal

54:28.060 --> 54:35.481
After achieving his ideals we reach another
because he was human ideal

54:35.530 --> 54:41.710
It is great that God came to this world
in a human form to became our ideal

54:41.741 --> 54:51.515
He has gone through all the hardships
to show us strength to keep Dharma

54:51.540 --> 54:56.223
That is Vishwa Dharma
and the state of yoga

54:56.834 --> 55:00.850
May God bless you all
