00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:13.887
So, today, I want to tell you about purity.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:21.483
That is my name, 'nir', Nir-mala.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:25.851
’Ni’ means ‘no’; ’mala’ means ‘impure’.

00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:29.293
The one who has no impurities is Nirmala.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:33.836
and that’s one of the names of the Goddess also.

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:46.222
Purity is a quality which is silent,

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:49.292
it speaks in silence.

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:54.372
It is one of the most non-aggressive activities.

00:00:58.137 --> 00:01:01.289
It probes into you.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.335
It doesn’t express in any way.

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:07.220
Even love may express: in words,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.753
it may express in action.

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:15.972
But this is the one which is expressionless, the purity.

00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:23.054
And it washes off all that is impure.

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:29.004
So let us see what are the things which we think

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.446
create impurities in us.

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:42.778
They say it in two words, you see: lust and greed.

00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:49.340
Now let us see if really these are impure things,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.718
or they create impurity in us,

00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:04.014
or why these two things have become the source of impurity to us?

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:14.739
Because we do not understand the right perspective

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.746
of matter and of sex.

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:26.552
If we can understand them in right perspective,

00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:32.969
then these two become the source of happiness and joy to us.

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.421
This is where we must understand that

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:42.145
we do not have proper feelers

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:45.997
for our own nourishment

00:02:46.077 --> 00:02:50.301
and we blame God, or we blame nature, we blame societies,

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:55.223
we blame cultures, we blame our parents, we blame our governments,

00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:58.217
we blame this and that.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:04.162
Because we have no feelers,

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:08.750
we suck in that is impure,

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:13.324
which will create more problems for us

00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:18.980
than joy and happiness and nourishment.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.074
If the tree has to grow,

00:03:21.154 --> 00:03:25.772
it should avoid all that is poisonous to it,

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.722
all that is impure.

00:03:28.802 --> 00:03:32.689
We go on collecting impurities very fast.

00:03:35.762 --> 00:03:39.489
And that’s what I call, is the human freedom:

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.118
if he wants he can collect impurities.

00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:46.819
A tree is not. It will not collect impurities.

00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:51.005
but if impurities invade it,

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:54.560
it will die, it cannot protect either.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.118
Human beings have a freedom to choose.

00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:02.647
Also they have the power to protect

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:12.893
from the new impurities. And Sahaja
Yogis, as you know, have much more powers.

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:21.223
So our roots have to go down, into what? Into dharma,

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:26.772
into sustaining power of love.

00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:32.283
If that is weak, then the roots are taken off

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.283
and such people are uprooted.

00:04:35.363 --> 00:04:40.449
Now how do you suck impurities?

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:47.403
You suck them because your feelers become blunt.

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:51.039
When your feelers are blunt,

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.937
you don’t know what you are sucking.

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:02.295
It only is possible when you are lob-headed, is the word.

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:08.406
But most of the human beings are born in innocence

00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:11.632
and they resist.

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:19.292
Gradually you start making your feelers damaged

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:24.571
and then the impurity starts coming in.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.367
All these things start, people say, from desire,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.807
clearly:

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.303
desire to be the king, desire to be most beautiful person,

00:05:44.383 --> 00:05:47.315
desire to be leader of the whole world,

00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:53.700
desire to eat, desire to have, possess — all desires.

00:05:56.673 --> 00:06:01.193
But here also, I would say, is an impurity.

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:13.124
Shri Ganesha is the source of purity, of purity.

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:19.623
The first thing established in this world was purity .

00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:26.397
So that, whatever living beings, the human beings

00:06:26.477 --> 00:06:30.574
all those who came into this world

00:06:30.654 --> 00:06:36.482
should be protected by purity.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:43.108
and be away from impure things.

00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:55.380
That is why, the whole creation was drenched with purity by Gauri ji.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.332
And after that the creation came into existence.

00:07:00.412 --> 00:07:05.542
So in our lives, the most important work is that

00:07:05.622 --> 00:07:12.090
that within ourselves, we should place purity at the highest level.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:21.494
But purity does not mean

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:25.083
that we take our bath, wash ourselves

00:07:25.163 --> 00:07:30.463
clean up, keep our body alright

00:07:30.543 --> 00:07:35.845
but to clean our hearts.

00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:41.378
The biggest disorder of the heart is anger.

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:45.962
Anger is the highest disorder of heart.

00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:51.086
And when a man gets angry

00:07:51.166 --> 00:08:00.896
that which is purity gets destroyed.

00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:08.837
Because another name of purity is selfless love.

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:17.952
That love which always flows and does not expect anything.

00:08:18.032 --> 00:08:23.375
The satisfaction of this love is that it is just flowing.

00:08:23.455 --> 00:08:31.508
And when it does not flow, it gets suffocated and disturbed.

00:08:31.588 --> 00:08:39.488
So, purity means that you fill your heart with love, not with anger.

00:08:39.568 --> 00:08:46.069
And you should fill yourself with purity, like Shri Ganesha.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:50.945
Only with purity can the wisdom settle down in human beings.

00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:55.490
Because the other name of love is 'Purity'.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:00.664
But wisdom also means love only.

00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:03.806
Every thing means love.

00:09:03.886 --> 00:09:10.396
If you are not able to acquire this wisdom

00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:14.482
and don't consider 'Love' as your own

00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:19.299
You are wasting your time by coming to Sahajyoga.

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:23.711
Now the time has come as such

00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.573
that everybody has to be united

00:09:26.653 --> 00:09:29.716
and have to transform ourselves.

00:09:29.796 --> 00:09:35.008
We have to transform ourselves, we have drawbacks.

00:09:35.088 --> 00:09:39.524
We have to purify ourselves completely.

00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:43.855
How much you are loving yourself

00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:51.864
And as a result of this transformation

00:09:51.944 --> 00:09:56.552
there is blessing of that life

00:09:56.632 --> 00:10:00.745
which cannot be described.

00:10:00.825 --> 00:10:02.317
which Kabir said

00:10:02.397 --> 00:10:07.025
"Aab mast hue, phir kya bole” (Now I
am drenched in joy, what shall i say?).

00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:09.850
So, you all be in that state of joy!

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.264
you all achieve that state of joy!

00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:16.888
and in that joy, you be joyous!

00:10:16.968 --> 00:10:20.366
These are My blessings!

00:10:24.618 --> 00:10:32.245
Christ’s life is a - symbolically can be called

00:10:32.325 --> 00:10:43.232
as the symbol of purity and holiness, He was purity and holiness.

00:10:43.312 --> 00:10:47.856
Holiness is very important today, when in this ghor Kali Yuga

00:10:47.936 --> 00:10:52.328
you find all kinds of horrible things happening.

00:10:52.408 --> 00:10:58.033
If you believe in holiness, in your chastity and in your purity,

00:10:58.113 --> 00:11:04.554
then your morality is within yourself, is not outside.

00:11:04.634 --> 00:11:07.137
Whatever people may say about Christ today,

00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:13.818
but you know as Sahaja Yogis that He was purest of pure.

00:11:13.898 --> 00:11:20.126
In the same way, we should try to
keep our purity above everything else.

00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:24.019
The most important thing for us to be pure people:

00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:30.055
pure from heart, pure in our morality, pure in our thinking

00:11:30.135 --> 00:11:35.179
and pure in our rapport that we have with others.

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:39.984
So the first and foremost thing we have to aspire is purity,

00:11:40.064 --> 00:11:44.254
as you know very well that Adi Shakti first created Shri Ganesha

00:11:44.334 --> 00:11:47.322
who is the symbol of purity.

00:11:47.402 --> 00:11:51.789
So today we have to take a vow, that henceforth

00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:57.429
we are going to follow a life of complete purity and detachment.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:00.933
That’s not so difficult if you understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:05.585
If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy to purify yourself.

00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:14.982
What we need are the people who are completely drenched

00:12:15.062 --> 00:12:19.342
into the purity of love.

00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:26.569
So, from love we go to another point which is purity.

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:34.529
And the purity is a subject

00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:37.929
which has been talked about by many people.

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:46.969
That you should be pure, you should be absolutely open

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:51.609
and people should know everything about you.

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:56.249
I don't think that is purity.

00:12:56.329 --> 00:13:00.129
Purity is that which purifies others!

00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:07.849
If you are a pure person, then others will be purified.

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:11.529
They have to be purified.

00:13:11.609 --> 00:13:16.609
Now supposing you have certain ideas about yourself,

00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:24.689
you think that you are very highly placed as a Sahaja Yogi

00:13:26.689 --> 00:13:34.016
and that you are full of love. Maybe it's all imaginary.

00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:38.489
Does it purify others?

00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:45.449
Does your purity purify ohters?

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:52.729
Can it give them awakening? Can they be Realised Souls?

00:13:54.049 --> 00:13:58.009
And then, how much do you value the purity,

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:03.409
the power of purity? And how many people you give Realisation

00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:06.929
Or you have kept it to yourself?

00:14:08.089 --> 00:14:13.729
How many places you have been to spread this purity?

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:18.009
Purity has to be spread.

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:26.569
And without any doubt, in your own purity,

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:32.249
you should do it because it's a very, very powerful thing.

00:14:33.929 --> 00:14:36.809
Purity is very powerful.

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:41.409
It may not act on one or two persons, doesn't matter.

00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:43.649
There could be some very,very

00:14:43.729 --> 00:14:46.489
nasty, horrible fellows, doesn`t matter.

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:55.569
But it will have an effect on very many sensitive persons

00:14:56.449 --> 00:15:02.249
who want to become Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:10.969
You have to just test it. How people like you

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:14.729
and how they are impressed by you.

00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:29.969
The Paramchaitanya, this all pervading power of Divine Love,

00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:34.689
flows through you because you are pure.

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:43.529
If you are impure, then it will stop at different chakras,

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:52.609
it won't work. So purity of temperament, purity of love

00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:56.729
what does that mean? That you love somebody

00:15:56.809 --> 00:16:04.169
because that person has got spirituality!

00:16:05.929 --> 00:16:10.969
You love that person because there is purity,

00:16:11.049 --> 00:16:18.169
and you go to places just to spread the purity among them.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:25.168
A pure person will never create a problem.

00:16:25.248 --> 00:16:28.569
It's the impure person who every day

00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:33.609
can start with this problem or that problem and that ...

00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:38.729
So the character of a Yogi is

00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:48.319
to worship the purity of your own and the purity of others.

00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:55.778
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

00:16:55.858 --> 00:17:01.858
then you must get a good amount of health,

00:17:02.493 --> 00:17:04.284
money

00:17:07.743 --> 00:17:09.619
and position,

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:11.533
power.

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:26.017
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha, Nirmal Ganesha.

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:36.785
“Oh, Mother, please give us

00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:43.402
the blessings of establishment of purity

00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:46.529
in our Ganesha principle.”

00:17:46.609 --> 00:17:52.205
Shri Ganesha is My Son

00:17:52.285 --> 00:17:56.410
because He is pure.

00:17:58.784 --> 00:18:02.579
Now He is not the only son I have.

00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:06.079
I have so many sons and daughters

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:08.929
and I have made you in the same way

00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:12.910
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.073
on My own.

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:24.496
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

00:18:24.576 --> 00:18:33.410
and purity of your body is going to please.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.328
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

00:18:39.408 --> 00:18:44.241
My name itself means purity.

00:18:45.701 --> 00:18:47.871
You can do it.

00:18:47.951 --> 00:18:49.829
You are empowered to do it.

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:51.704
You have a Kundalini to do it.

00:18:51.784 --> 00:18:57.659
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

00:18:59.826 --> 00:19:02.452
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:04.574
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

00:19:04.654 --> 00:19:09.034
Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:13.573
So what is this magnet?

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:17.903
Is pure love.

00:19:18.612 --> 00:19:21.324
Is pure love

00:19:21.404 --> 00:19:25.633
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

00:19:26.454 --> 00:19:30.582
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

00:19:30.662 --> 00:19:34.829
It is the support of itself.

00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:39.374
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

00:19:39.454 --> 00:19:43.297
doesn’t want anything, doesn’t expect anything.

00:19:43.377 --> 00:19:49.333
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

00:19:49.413 --> 00:19:51.468
That’s why they get attracted.

00:19:54.967 --> 00:20:01.071
Also we must understand the innocence means purity, purity of thought.

00:20:01.151 --> 00:20:05.726
As I explained yesterday I hope you understood the meaning of purity.

00:20:05.806 --> 00:20:14.053
Purity is to be understood much more by Europeans. Very important.

00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:22.325
Specially French. Because the whole society is suffering.

00:20:22.405 --> 00:20:28.944
Society can only be pure if the family life is pure.

00:20:29.024 --> 00:20:32.998
Not only that but your relations with each other are pure.

00:20:33.078 --> 00:20:40.821
One must understand that purity means chastity.

00:20:40.901 --> 00:20:44.469
Innocence means chastity,

00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:50.423
not only physical also mental chastity.

00:20:50.503 --> 00:20:53.146
You have to have mental chastity,

00:20:53.226 --> 00:20:57.846
if you don’t have mental chastity you cannot ascend.

00:20:57.926 --> 00:21:03.668
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali is that She is purity.

00:21:03.748 --> 00:21:06.788
Absolute purity.

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:16.081
And that purity if we cannot imbibe
within us, we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:20.673
Now this mind is so much conditioned, I know.

00:21:20.753 --> 00:21:23.876
Our children will be much better off than ourselves.

00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:29.277
Then they won’t have these conditionings as we have had.

00:21:29.357 --> 00:21:35.736
And so many problems can be just
avoided if you really become pure people.

00:21:35.816 --> 00:21:41.603
So the, She, She’s the one, She gives you stithi, the state.

00:21:41.683 --> 00:21:46.399
Stithi means consolidation.

00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:52.770
Without your proper consolidation into your purity,

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:59.519
not into your romantic life, you cannot rise.

00:22:01.099 --> 00:22:06.124
Like when we make the aeroplane, first we have to consolidate it.

00:22:06.204 --> 00:22:10.831
Fix it up properly, work it out, so that when it goes in the air

00:22:10.911 --> 00:22:17.235
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:26.548
In the same way when we are ascending Shri Ganesha does that,

00:22:26.628 --> 00:22:33.405
he just stops the action of excretion
completely and the ascent starts.

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:39.965
if the Sahasrara is spoilt, how can Sahaja Yoga work out?

00:22:40.045 --> 00:22:43.338
The whole play is of the Sahasrara.

00:22:45.946 --> 00:22:50.545
And that purity should manifest.

00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:56.613
Through you we are going to change the world, through no one else.

00:22:56.693 --> 00:22:59.432
It’s the Sahaja Yogis who are going to change it.

00:22:59.512 --> 00:23:02.921
So the whole night we enjoyed ourselves.

00:23:05.613 --> 00:23:15.435
Now this enjoyment cannot come to you if
you do not have purity of your mind — nirananda.

00:23:15.515 --> 00:23:20.312
You can get other ‘anands’ of other things, other chakras.

00:23:20.392 --> 00:23:25.100
How to bring the purity?

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:31.747
Just by developing thoughtless awareness
and looking at things without thinking.

00:23:35.244 --> 00:23:42.153
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

00:23:42.233 --> 00:23:50.332
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:58.570
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:08.231
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

00:24:08.851 --> 00:24:15.451
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:22.572
and if you use that glass on top of
the light, how can the light pass out?

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:30.973
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:34.954
and cannot show your inner light also.

00:24:35.034 --> 00:24:43.350
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

00:24:43.964 --> 00:24:48.233
But people say that we have to accept

00:24:48.313 --> 00:24:53.338
because if you have to have more people for your religion

00:24:53.418 --> 00:25:00.335
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:04.807
And just think of it.

00:25:04.887 --> 00:25:09.844
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

00:25:09.924 --> 00:25:16.456
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

00:25:16.536 --> 00:25:24.627
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

00:25:26.045 --> 00:25:33.888
If your eyes are clean and pure,

00:25:33.968 --> 00:25:43.270
then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

00:25:44.313 --> 00:25:51.738
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

00:25:51.818 --> 00:25:56.783
in completeness if your eyes are clean.

00:25:56.863 --> 00:26:03.846
If you think Christ is the one who was
resurrected and you are to be resurrected,

00:26:03.926 --> 00:26:10.531
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:18.925
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

00:26:19.005 --> 00:26:24.211
cannot have lust and greed in them.

00:26:25.786 --> 00:26:31.088
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

00:26:31.168 --> 00:26:38.904
You have to be aware of yourself and of
your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

00:26:38.984 --> 00:26:43.636
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

00:26:43.716 --> 00:26:49.786
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

00:26:49.866 --> 00:26:55.626
Purity is the basis of your existence.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:59.213
Purity is the message,

00:26:59.293 --> 00:27:05.009
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

00:27:05.089 --> 00:27:08.406
As I love you, you will love you also.

00:27:08.486 --> 00:27:15.547
And then you will understand this
word love which comes out of the purity.

00:27:15.627 --> 00:27:24.836
The blossoming of your purity, the
fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:30.949
and the love that you have flows,

00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:37.175
flows towards all those who are to
be loved, who have to be looked after.

00:27:38.447 --> 00:27:40.171
May God bless you.
