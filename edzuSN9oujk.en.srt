1
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:13,059
This place, Nasik, has a special significance,
that long time back, say about eight thousands

2
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:26,359
years back, when Shri Rama went away for His
exile, He came to Maharashtra and He passed

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:39,700
through various places and He settled down
in Nasik, this place, with His wife.

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:54,149
And here a lady who was actually the wife,
was the sister of Ravana, called Shurpanakha,

5
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:04,780
she tried to entice Shri Rama.

6
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:20,250
Now this quality of enticing men or enticing
women are really demonic and that is how people

7
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,290
call them rakshasas.

8
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:37,060
Because those who are demonic people are people
who are by nature aggressive, full of ego,

9
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:43,770
who want to overpower everyone.

10
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,670
And they feel quite satisfied if their ego
is satisfied.

11
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:57,530
So all the people who were like that, were
called as rakshasas in this country.

12
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:05,950
Was not a normal human behavior, according
to them.

13
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:23,440
So these rakshasas were more living in the
northern part, northern most part of India

14
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,420
and they have different categories like described.

15
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,390
So those who run after women were called by
some other name and where the women tried

16
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,000
to dominate them are called by some other
name.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,810
Where the men tried to become like women,
there is another name.

18
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,780
But they were never called as human beings.

19
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:56,840
They were called as “Rakshasas” or “Betalas”
and all other names.

20
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:05,900
But now-a-days you find such a confusion that
you don’t know whom to call what.

21
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:16,460
But the human beings in those days were sensible,
matured, deep, who with the age matured.

22
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:25,470
Now you have to notice on the streets of Maharashtra,
just now I was coming by train, I saw, no

23
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,920
men, there were nobody who were interested
in women, no women were interested in men,

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,260
some men were hugging each other, walking
around, holding innocently.

25
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:47,590
I mean, the whole thing was, that life is
innocence.

26
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,790
And that is what it was here when this rakshasa’s
sister, Shurpanakha.

27
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,630
So nowadays, if there is a woman in India
who behaves like that, tries to entice men

28
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,510
is called Shurpanakha.

29
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,290
So this woman came and tried to entice Shri
Rama.

30
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,620
Imagine what audacity.

31
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:17,600
So, Shri Rama being sankochit, he was a man
full of grace, He told her, “See now, what’s

32
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,060
the use of running after Me?

33
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,650
I’ve already got a beautiful wife.

34
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,490
So why do you run after Me?

35
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:34,150
Better try My brother who has no wife.

36
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:47,320
” Because He knew that His brother is a
Sheshnaga, he is the serpent on which, very

37
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,310
big serpent called Shesha, Shesha.

38
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:58,780
And he is a hot tempered fellow and he will
just know how to deal with this woman and

39
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,530
“I can’t manage this show.

40
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,330
” Because He would not ill-treat a woman,
it was too much for Him.

41
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:12,220
Though she was Shurpanakha, and not only that,
but she was also a woman.

42
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:24,780
So when He went, no, He asked her that, “You
go and see him.

43
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,090
” Lakshmana was sitting outside.

44
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:39,169
Lakshmana had taken a vow to be a brahmachari,
a celibate man, with fourteen years penance,

45
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,740
though he was a married man.

46
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,600
This he had to do and that’s the only way
he could kill another demon, whose name was

47
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,840
Meghnad, who had run away with his daughter,
called as Sulochana.

48
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,560
It’s a long story.

49
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:08,639
So, make it short, this fellow went to this
brahmachari, Lakshmana, thou he had a wife

50
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,080
in Ayodhya, was leading a life of brahmachari.

51
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,840
It is very common in India.

52
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,490
I mean, if your wife is away, you just think
about her, and you are in separation, still

53
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,890
you enjoy your wife thinking about her.

54
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,180
You think about the good things she has done
to you.

55
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,570
But if she has done all the time bad things,
you don’t want too think about her.

56
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,070
And then all these demonic things start.

57
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,320
All right.

58
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,710
So this, when she went and started.

59
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:48,520
She dressed up very well, in a very attractive
manner, tried to show off her body and all

60
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:55,890
that, in a very funny way, and not in the
traditional, decent way, but a very indecent,

61
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,680
indecorous manner, just to attract.

62
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,570
He was so angry with her, He just cut her
nose.

63
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:14,700
So she should not do this to anybody else
and get rid of her pride of nonsense, to kill

64
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,220
her ego.

65
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:24,360
Because nose is the one that expresses actually
the ego part.

66
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:33,680
So when he cut his nose, the nose is called
as nasika, in Sanskrit, is called as nasika.

67
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:41,360
This was the place where the nose was cut
and that’s why this place was called as

68
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,650
Nasik.

69
00:07:42,650 --> 00:08:01,690
So now we have to remember we have come to
an area where noses can be cut.

70
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:16,370
So one has to be careful 
and on the watch out that we do not show any,

71
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,930
any symptom that Shurpanakha did, hence forth.

72
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:29,810
We should behave in a manner that we are Sahaja
Yogis and Sahaja Yoginis.

73
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:44,800
And we have to have that right type of conduct
which comes from the purity inside.

74
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:55,940
So, as this is now actually the beginning
of the tour in the real sense of the word,

75
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:07,550
I have to make certain suggestions to all
of you, that our behavior should be very decent

76
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:20,300
and decorous so that all the vibrations that
are flowing through us, which are holy vibrations,

77
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:30,759
auspicious vibrations, should not be spoiled
by our ego or our Shurpanakha ideas, or any

78
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:37,160
such nonsense which has no relevance to your
ascent.

79
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,389
All these come from decadence, the decadence
we have gone through.

80
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:47,209
And because you have come up you can see the
decadence of the society.

81
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:57,879
So here you have to show through your good
behavior, good dress and good conduct, the

82
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:05,239
beauty that you have developed within yourself
and that now you belong to a society which

83
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:09,579
has ascent and the decadence is over now.

84
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:21,740
It is only for you to watch that and to help
others to come out of it.

85
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,009
Beginning of the tour at Nasik is a very holy
and auspicious thing that has happened to

86
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,380
all of you.

87
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:38,259
Because the river here Godhavari is called
as the Ganges of the south.

88
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:50,649
But as in every pure thing all the filth is
put in, this great kshetra, the pilgrimage,

89
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:57,769
is ruined by many people who want to exploit.

90
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,489
We call them as “vadjees”.

91
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:06,009
They are the ones who are making money out
of the temples, out of the holiness of this

92
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:07,449
place.

93
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:14,230
To them Sahaja Yoga is a challenge because
you can do it without any money, without any

94
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:22,220
work, without any extra sacrifices.

95
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,829
That they can’t understand.

96
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:32,080
According to the theory of all these people,
all over the world, if you see, is this, that

97
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,010
all those who are seeking should hand over
the purse to the people who are in charge,

98
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,369
first of all.

99
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:44,529
Secondly, those who are seeking should become
absolutely miserable in their seeking.

100
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,510
They should suffer, suffer and suffer.

101
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,879
Till they become just bones and die.

102
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:59,019
They have to go on sacrificing everything,
going through tortures till they reach God.

103
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:05,019
This is not the way the ascent has to be achieved,
as you have learned it.

104
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:16,059
This is true not only of Hindus, also of Jains,
also of Christianity, also of Islam.

105
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:21,860
The way it is preached today is all adharma,
there is no dharma in it.

106
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:29,959
That’s why the establishment of our dharma
is very important, which is the pure religion

107
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:39,839
which gives you ascent, joy, peace and the
blessings of God.

108
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:47,440
This is what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

109
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,720
Now I have to also say that this place has
another significance that we have a very powerful

110
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,809
Jain, a gentleman who has come to this dharma.

111
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:06,699
Now, Jainism again the same style it’s going,
same perversions as we have seen.

112
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:12,230
Like about Jains if I’m going tell you,
you will laugh and laugh, and laugh and just

113
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,230
won’t stop.

114
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,339
So I don’t want to go about it.

115
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,269
Again, the Jains are mad about vegetarianism.

116
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:24,559
They want to save all the mosquitoes, bugs,
everything and kill the human beings, all

117
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,230
right, with money.

118
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,639
They are the Jews of our country and they
have really extracted people, their money

119
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,639
and everything.

120
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,980
Very rich people here but they don’t kill
a mosquito or kill a bug.

121
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,019
That’s what they are.

122
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:50,910
So now this kind of thing is on and doctor
Sanghvi, who is a very learned man, his wife

123
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:58,110
is another very affectionate and dedicated
Sahaja Yogini, the son, daughter in law, all

124
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:05,370
of them have understood that religion cannot
be such madness that you start saving the

125
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,079
mosquitoes and not the human beings.

126
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:14,230
The attention is from the other end, which,
of course, against Mahavira’s principle.

127
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,819
Mahavira on the contrary had described the
hell the best.

128
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:27,230
He is the one who being the Incarnation of
the essence of Bhairava and described the

129
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,299
hell very well.

130
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:33,850
And in England we have William Blake, who
has also done the same way because he is the

131
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,009
same style, he is the same thing.

132
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,549
What is hell that he described, there are
worms, there are mosquitoes, this, that.

133
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:48,230
And just the opposite of that is to save the
mosquitoes and bugs, shows how we go just

134
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:56,970
the other way round, how we oppose the religious
achievements of these great people, those

135
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,730
who tried to teach something sensible, how
they make a nonsense out of it.

136
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:16,949
That is how, here we see that the Jains should
see how Shri Mahavira is being misinterpreted

137
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,949
and insulted in many ways.

138
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:26,059
This is a very big achievement I feel that
some people have started seeing this light

139
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,879
and they will start seeing it more and more.

140
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:40,730
Also we have some very good here musicians,
as you have heard him and it’s a whole party

141
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,800
was so beautiful, I heard about him, that
he sang beautiful songs for you and you enjoyed

142
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,420
all the music program.

143
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,160
And he also sang some very nice English songs.

144
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,389
It’s a good beginning.

145
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:02,519
Because as you are singing Marathi songs and
Hindi songs, our Indians also should sing.

146
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,359
But they make a melody out of everything.

147
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:13,499
So you have to little bit guide them, because
they are, you see, they are melody oriented

148
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,499
musicians.

149
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:21,549
So we try to make melody out of everything,
otherwise it doesn’t go with our minds all

150
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,549
right.

151
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,029
So you have to give some guidance and you
have to forgive them if you think it is not

152
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:32,759
absolutely all right.

153
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:40,609
So we have to thank all the people over here
for being so kind and so nice to us, and the

154
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:41,609
singing.

155
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,869
And I hope you are all very comfortable in
that place.

156
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:52,690
The only problem was we couldn’t get a proper
place, as doctor Sanghvi was worried.

157
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,459
Because, you see, Indians are too much hospitable.

158
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,329
And he said, “I’ll have to cover all the
sides, I don’t want them to get the cold,

159
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:01,329
this, that.

160
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:03,329
I’ll put some heaters there.

161
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:10,740
” But by God’s grace, there’s no need.

162
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,230
And so pleasant.

163
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,490
I was just smiling at him, I said, “don’t
you worry, everything will work out.

164
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,210
” And it has worked out, you know, we don’t
need any heaters, and if we need anything,

165
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,690
we might need some fans.

166
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:31,030
Like in Madras they said, “We have no water,
we have to buy water now from other places

167
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,710
going to be, we are all going to be dying.

168
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,790
” I said, “All right, you’ll have water.

169
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:46,080
” So it rained, rained, rained so much that
they had floods.

170
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:55,960
So it should not be felt that there is a problem
with the nature.

171
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,420
Nature is always with you, will always help
you, will be kind.

172
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,760
But we have to be kind to ourselves, to our
nature.

173
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,490
The nature that we have is that we are human
beings, we are not rakshasas, we are not devils,

174
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:18,420
we can’t do all these things which are devilish,
which are nonsensical.

175
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:29,450
And once we understand that we are saints,
we will know that we have to keep our saintly

176
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:37,310
hood in such a manner that others can see
through our behavior.

177
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:46,620
Nasik has another great heritage that many
saints came and did tapasyas, tapoguni.

178
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:56,690
Nasik area is the tapoguni, is the land of
tapas, tapasyas and that’s why this is a

179
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,310
very, very auspicious land.

180
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,290
And here it is.

181
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:22,070
You will see on your way to Dhulia, the Incarnation
of the Adi Shakti, which is the three powers

182
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:49,480
of the Kundalini completely integrated, expressed
here as Sapta Shringi, meaning seven peaks.

183
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,120
Now seven peaks are the seven centers in the
brain.

184
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:05,230
And the Kundalini, though she has seven centers
to pass through, the governing pithas, the

185
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:17,020
seats, are in the peak, in the head and so
Adi Shakti takes place in the Sahastrara.

186
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,290
She incarnates in the Sahastrara.

187
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:27,620
So we can say that this is the Sahastrara
of Maharashtra, or of the Universe in a way,

188
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:36,580
though Himalaya is regarded as the real abode
of Sadashiva, which is on top.

189
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:44,090
But the Sahastrara part, which is the limbic
area, should be here because we have three

190
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,050
and a half coils settled here.

191
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,200
That’s why the Kundalini of the Universe
is here.

192
00:20:51,200 --> 00:21:01,960
But as the Sapta Shringi has come out of Mother
Earth, this is the place where we can say

193
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,300
resides the Sahastrara.

194
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:13,890
Though the, on top is the Himalaya, and Himalaya
we can say is beyond Sahastrara, the three

195
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:20,850
powers of the Goddess I don’t know if you’ll
be seeing all these, three expressed in three

196
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:27,270
different places in the Maharashtra, but this
is the Ardha Matra, the half Matra, which

197
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,430
is the Adi Shakti Herself.

198
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:39,110
And this is what you see in this place and
I’m sure you’ll enjoy it tomorrow when

199
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,290
you go on your way to Dhulia.

200
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:52,280
With this understanding that in a subtle way
we are in a very important place, I hope you

201
00:21:52,280 --> 00:22:12,960
all will raise above mundane gross attention
into a subtler attention, into a higher attention and enjoy  the bliss of God.

202
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,380
May God bless you.
