00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
It was such an unexpected,\h
joyous event for us, that\h\h

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.080
Srimati Padma Menon has agreed to\h
give this beautiful performance, and\h\h

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.320
to again remind us what we saw in Madras.
Actually her guru was there and we went to her,\h\h

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.720
foundation, where there were\h
fifty ladies who danced before Me.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.520
It was a great, pleasure to see you here,\h\h

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
that in a foreign country, you are\h
spreading the Art of our country.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
I am sure you must have understood\h
most of her actions but,\h\h

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.440
what you have to see is the, her\h
mastery over rhythm, firstly.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.080
And secondly on the, Abhinaya, means the Maya.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.000
Such a master she is.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.080
And it’s a very vigorous vibrant dance.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.080
I’m seeing one better than\h
the other as I would say.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.040
I saw lots of them in Madras and now here\h
to see her, it was a great pleasure to Me.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.600
And to all of us, because we know a lot about\h
Ramayana, we know lot about Mahabharata.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.680
But to weave it into such beautiful patterns, is\h
something, of a great art, and a great talent.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.920
It’s not possible for\h
everybody to dance like this.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.360
Neither, even if you practice\h
you cannot dance like this.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.160
It’s something innate.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.360
Something inner force that works it out so well.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.040
For such a long she danced.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.240
I mean, one would feel completely exhausted.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.480
But with such vigor, with such power,\h
she’s shown different expressions.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.400
One minute she is this.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.840
One minute she is that.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.440
It’s really very remarkable.
I’m really proud of her that,\h\h

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.000
she has come to Australia to spread this beautiful\h
dancing pattern, and to teach others, here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010
May God bless her.
