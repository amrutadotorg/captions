00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
I've gotten so used to it, it's so hard to look back.

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120
One thing I go maybe in retrospect,

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.560
I couldn't imagine not being married to Sad Yogi,

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.960
I would not be married otherwise.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.880
I only want to be married to Sad Yogi and only to Alan.

6
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.880
So because we have learned many lessons of the past

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480
and the marriage has evolved and we found out things about each other,

8
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.200
especially about ourselves through the process,

9
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.160
that were invaluable and for me it only has to be with Sad Yogi

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.240
to be able to share every Sadhic experience

11
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.280
with someone who is right there.

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.800
This is absolutely a privilege.

13
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.000
I can't thank him enough for that.

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.040
And for his patience to listen to me when I go on and on.

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.920
In his manly fashion he wants to be short and brief,

16
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.560
I sometimes go on.

17
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.240
So these are little things but they are very entertaining also.

18
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.800
For instance, lately I have to tell him,

19
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.760
I'm so grateful because how we complement each other.

20
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.240
For instance, in the beginning I didn't know this.

21
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.520
In the beginning I thought,

22
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.440
oh, Alan is also calm and detached and nothing can move him.

23
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.960
Whereas I was more bubbly and I had a bit more temperamental perhaps.

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.880
Yeah, so there.

25
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.800
Now I think, thank God I have him like a soundboard

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.440
to witness my things and then we all come down again nicely.

27
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.360
This is just an example that I, over the years,

28
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.120
I didn't see this at the beginning.

29
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.720
I thought, my goodness, he's such a yogi but he's not so emotional.

30
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.640
He's so, whereas I am, so now I know for sure this is very, very good

31
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.800
for both of us to balance each other and we enjoy this

32
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.600
and find it quite humorous most of the time.

33
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.040
So...

34
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.440
And which year was that?

35
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.680
Which year did you get married?

36
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.040
All right, so we got married in 1987.

37
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.120
Let's go back to that point.

38
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.720
Why it happened, I have to say at that time,

39
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.400
it was quite a different situation for me.

40
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.040
In 1987, I was...

41
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.560
No, that was 87, 86, I was still married.

42
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240
That was my first...

43
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280
To someone else.

44
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.040
Of course, to someone else.

45
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.120
I said, what do you think?

46
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.080
It was a Sahaj marriage.

47
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.680
I wasn't involved.

48
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.320
Shimata never asked me anything.

49
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.200
It was organized by others.

50
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200
Then when Shimata...

51
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.600
And also I had a small child.

52
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.440
So in 86, and that small child was at that time about a year old.

53
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.680
So in 1986, Shimataji came to Vienna.

54
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.000
She called me to her room.

55
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.920
I had no idea what to expect.

56
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.400
There were other Sahaja yogis in the room.

57
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.680
She asked me a few questions about that first marriage.

58
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.560
And then she said to me,

59
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.960
you know, I think it's better to divorce.

60
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.120
And that took me completely by surprise.

61
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.840
I had never asked for that.

62
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.160
I had never talked to anyone about this first marriage,

63
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.320
except to one person.

64
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.480
Because I don't want to go into details now,

65
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.160
but that's what happened.

66
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.400
So Shimataji helped me there in front of witnesses.

67
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.400
She dissolved that first marriage.

68
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.000
And I did not ask for it.

69
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.280
I was completely surprised.

70
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.400
But inside of me, I knew it was the right thing.

71
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.360
And at the same...

72
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.720
Her same state, a day later, a day later,

73
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.160
she looked at me and gave me direct advice.

74
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.520
Well, she didn't say what she said.

75
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.200
Okay, she said, you know, there are many good Sahaja yogis,

76
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.920
many good husbands in Sahaja yoga.

77
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.320
And that... Okay, why does she say that?

78
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.000
And she said it twice, directly in my face.

79
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.440
And that really startled me,

80
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.480
because I've never...

81
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.440
This was all very overwhelming for me, this procedure.

82
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.520
I didn't have time to think.

83
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.440
But I had been the help of brothers and sisters

84
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.240
who gently coaxed me to put my name on the marriage list again,

85
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.800
which I've never done, never without all these experiences.

86
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.760
So I said, okay, well...

87
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.440
But of course, now I had a child.

88
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.600
And so just...

89
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.000
Just...

90
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.440
I did get put my name on the marriage list.

91
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.280
Yes, then I got divorced.

92
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.000
So in India then, Shimataji matched me to Alan.

93
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.600
And there I was, I didn't talk to her.

94
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.240
She didn't talk to me in India personally at all.

95
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.920
And when I came, of course, I have different backgrounds

96
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.360
than many other yogis who went there for the first time to get married.

97
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.360
So in my heart was just, if it is meant to be,

98
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.680
please, this Sahaja Yogi who will be solid and who will be kind to my daughter

99
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.560
and who will accept her unreservedly.

100
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.720
That was my wish.

101
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.840
From then on, we can manage.

102
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.600
And so I got introduced to Alan.

103
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.520
I'm sure, brothers, I can't remember.

104
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.080
It was a bit exciting.

105
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.520
Someone put us in front of each other.

106
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.640
Edward Socks did.

107
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.360
Oh, it was Edward Socks.

108
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.120
He was very excited.

109
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.600
Very excited.

110
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.560
So again, I looked at him and I said, well, I didn't feel anything different.

111
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.080
I can't say it when I saw Alan for the first time.

112
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.280
It was, uh-huh, OK.

113
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.000
Like there was nothing deeply exploding in myself.

114
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.480
But we got a little time to talk and I wanted to feel him out,

115
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.160
how he felt about sucking on my daughter.

116
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.800
And that really reassured me that he was very fine, very good, very nice.

117
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.760
So I said, wow.

118
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.760
So that convinced me on a level that, well, this is a husband I want

119
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.400
because he accepts my daughter.

120
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.200
And who was that?

121
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.200
And I felt he was honest there.

122
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.000
And so we took it from there.

123
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.480
I tell you, it was such an intense time.

124
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.360
All these things happening that I can't really remember many details.

125
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.480
They would come back to me, of course, how we had to treat each other at the ceremony,

126
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.920
how we had to write poetry about each other.

127
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.920
I was told we were the greatest poets.

128
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:41.120
But anyway, so in general, in a nutshell, for me, it was just the beginning

129
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.040
of an evolving, very beautiful story.

130
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.960
And that I now every day appreciate more.

131
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.680
And I don't know why things happen the way they did.

132
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.160
I have no idea.

133
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.800
At least it's all in traumatically loving hearts.

134
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.880
I don't need to know everything.

135
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.600
But now it's good.

136
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.560
And the main thing, we have two more children.

137
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.960
They have been inside, they have been brought up.

138
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.840
They now take hiatus and they are not currently involved,

139
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.600
and involved in Sahaja Yoga.

140
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.640
They respect all the Sahaja Yogis.

141
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.520
And I hope it will go on many, many years.

142
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.560
That's the main thing.

143
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280
Nice.

144
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.240
Yeah. Okay.

145
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.680
Well, a little background.

146
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.960
I came to Sahaja Yoga in the fall of 1985.

147
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800
Pardon me?

149
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840
No?

150
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880
Okay.

151
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.160
I came in the fall of 1985.

152
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200
I was in Sahaja Yoga for about three months.

153
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.880
Then I moved into the ashram in January.

154
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.320
And then the following year in December, I left for the India tour.

155
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:13.960
So I was actually the only Canadian that was on the whole tour there at the time.

156
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:25.320
So I felt I found the tour to be interesting because I didn't know what to expect.

157
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.520
Everything was new.

158
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.560
Everything was fresh.

159
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.120
Of course, there were times when the vibrations were wonderful.

160
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.000
And there were times when it was more difficult.

161
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
People were tough.

162
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.160
You'd get sick, you'd yell.

163
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.800
And then, of course, I had my name on the marriage list.

164
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.600
I remember the leader at that time said, maybe I want to wait another year.

165
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.080
And I said, no, I want my name on the list this year.

166
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.120
I went there and we got matched.

167
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.120
And as Edward Sogstead introduced us together.

168
00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.760
And I guess like a lot of people from the West, I had my own fair share of conditioning.

169
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.240
And I mean, expectations.

170
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:13.680
It's one thing to say that you are detached and you will accept whoever Shri Mataji marries you to.

171
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.240
It's another thing to deal with the reality.

172
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:27.440
So like Inga said, when I first saw her, I didn't feel one way or the other, whether this person or not that I should marry.

173
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.880
I just sort of took a wait and see.

174
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.520
But I do remember distinctly that I was quite happy about the fact that she had a child.

175
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:44.160
So, yeah, I mean, I've always really liked all children for that matter.

176
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.000
I like that.

177
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.520
But especially little girls, because I knew that my family, the dominant tendency was just for boys as well.

178
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.400
So I thought, okay, to get a little girl, that's nice.

179
00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:01.760
And the idea or concept that it's someone else's child never took hold of me.

180
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.640
For some reason, I felt, okay, yeah, they're all God's children.

181
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.720
And it doesn't matter who biologically they came from.

182
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:18.960
The main thing about children is you just love them and you experience the love they have to give.

183
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.520
So we went along.

184
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.120
I had my up periods and I had my down periods.

185
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:38.240
But much like Inga was saying in retrospect, you see clearly all the reasons Srimadaji had for putting me together.

186
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.640
And I am very thankful to Srimadaji for matching me with Inga,

187
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:54.120
because my one main concern was having a strong ill-being by my side in my life.

188
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.360
And this is the one thing she's always been.

189
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.440
She's been a real rock there.

190
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.800
She had more experience in sahaja matters than I did.

191
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:19.640
And I think that she has such strong positive qualities that I can really see helped me to balance and offset my imbalances as well.

192
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.040
So that we're very happy.

193
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:30.840
And I mean, other than that, we had a very traditional marriage that at least for sahaja at that time, we got a khatikule.

194
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:38.360
And we rode on the grooms all rode on bullock carts in before.

195
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.280
So do a cart.

196
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:45.200
And we had the sheets of the fire and all the rest of the vibrations were, of course, wonderful.

197
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:51.160
Whenever I put my attention on the vibrations, they were very good for us to be as a match.

198
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.160
So I thought, OK.

199
00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:02.520
And then I remember very distinctly, Sharmataji talking before the marriages actually took place.

200
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.160
And there was all of us that were matched and some people refused the match.

201
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.080
I remember somewhere around two or three women declined.

202
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:22.640
And boy, oh boy, I was really glad I accepted because Sharmataji really gave it to them left and right.

203
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.520
And I know the other thing, of course, I had some doubts and I know I'm not the only groom like that.

204
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.960
I've seen men faint when they were announced their marriage is as far as that goes.

205
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.280
Because it is, you know, you just face all this stuff in yourself and it has very little to do with the person.

206
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.280
It's just facing your own stuff.

207
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:55.280
But I also remember very distinctly that I had some very powerful, rocky brothers,

208
00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.480
people like Greg Warr and leaders, this country and that country and so ever.

209
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.240
And they're all coming up to me, yeah, congratulations.

210
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.280
This will be a very good match.

211
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:15.000
And, you know, I felt like it would be nice to discuss things in general without having people just telling me this, this, this, encouraging.

212
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.160
But all said and done, like I say, Felicity mentioned it, that you see a lot of the reasons inside.

213
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.400
And it's the inside things that really count.

214
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:35.240
It's mainly, is this person a good yogini and is it someone that will love you and look after you and vice versa?

215
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.920
And someone that's a good mother for your children?

216
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:51.480
All of these qualities that are not found in today's society very much that you see in the gift that Sharmaji gave you.

217
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.800
So, yeah.

218
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.080
And then, oh, we got married again.

219
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.120
We had a second marriage.

220
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.480
I believe it, I don't know if it's called an Aryan Samaj.

221
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:21.480
But we were married legally in a Hindu ceremony that was arranged, which was, yeah, a bit strange, you know, because that would give us the legal paperwork that we needed in order to have Inga come to America.

222
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.800
So a lot of, I don't know if they've done that very many times.

223
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.880
I haven't heard of anyone else.

224
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.320
Kind of a funny little incident.

225
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:42.560
There was a woman there who, at any rate, so yeah, we had that ceremony.

226
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:50.240
And so we got married in January and somewhere in May, I believe Inga was able to make it.

227
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.280
So it was really quick to immigrate into Canada.

228
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.120
But I would not recommend any Aryan Samaj wedding.

229
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.720
It was only adding complications.

230
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:12.560
In the end, I had to be a bride to be sent to India so that they sent the certificate.

231
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.320
I hope the bride was worthy to hear.

232
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.600
So anyway, this is the site.

233
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.080
I don't think this happens afterwards ever again.

234
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:30.240
Oh, we had a honeymoon, which is great.

235
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.200
Yeah, we did.

236
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.600
That was actually nice.

237
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.400
You wanted to send it on a honeymoon.

238
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:34.960
That's true.

239
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.840
In India, in the hotel.

240
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880
It was strange.

241
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.920
You sit there and look at each other.

242
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.600
It was interesting.

243
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.960
You got room service.

244
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.360
You could order whatever you want.

245
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.880
And your dobi actually came back cleaner than when you sent it out.

246
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.760
So I remember those little things.

247
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.280
But it's sure an adventure, and I can only recommend it.

248
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.440
You have to go with it.

249
00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.840
You have to go forward.

250
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.640
It'll work out.

251
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.520
So interesting.

252
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.120
Yes.

253
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.520
Each year, each marriage and each marriage ceremony has been so different.

254
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.320
Thank you so much.

255
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.280
Very nice.

256
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:21.960
And so I think we should quickly go on to our last speaker for the evening.

257
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.560
Victoria.

258
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.200
So can we have you on the camera, Victoria?

259
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.960
Yes.

260
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.440
Let's hear from you.

261
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.640
I can't hear you.

262
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.440
Are you muted?

263
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:51.480
I was saying, I just want to know what happened to the 12th groom who didn't have a horse.

264
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.200
Did he have to run behind the other horses, or did he double up with someone else?

265
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.240
But I'm sure we'll get there.

266
00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.240
No, he didn't double up.

267
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.800
They were very skinny horses.

268
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.320
They weren't looking very healthy.

269
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.440
I can't remember.

270
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.480
I have to ask Richard.

271
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.600
He used to look up me, but everybody got there.

272
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.880
Everybody got there.

273
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.720
Excellent.

274
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.080
Yeah, so I guess mine kind of fits a little bit.

275
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:22.040
Later, it was 91, and I was still rather new in Sahaj.

276
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:28.360
Had not put my name on the list, and somehow had just heard a talk before going to India,

277
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:36.120
which was the Pappach talk about how dare anyone say no to anyone I would match them

278
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.120
with to be married in Sahaj.

279
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.080
I don't know if anyone had heard that, but it was really a blast.

280
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.200
It was like 40 minutes of that.

281
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.400
And so for that and other reasons, I just thought, I just want to meditate.

282
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.680
I don't want to be putting my attention on that.

283
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.680
So I went on the tour without that intention.

284
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.800
Then one fine day, I woke up and thought, oh, this left Nabi.

285
00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.800
It's never going to clear.

286
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.400
I guess I should get married.

287
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:08.080
But kind of envisioning a life of suffering and tapas, because that's what I sort of thought

288
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.640
Sahaj marriage was at that point, because I had only met couples who were rather suffering

289
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.280
tapas type of couples, and thought, OK, I'll just throw my lot in.

290
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.000
And yeah, so put my name down rather late, as we really discourage people to do.

291
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:33.520
And as the Divine, this is always about how Shri Mataji finds exactly the thing for your

292
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.800
ascent, for your understanding and widening as a person.

293
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.680
And so for me, it was the year you weren't supposed to say no.

294
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.400
She matched me with someone who was kind of a crazy person.

295
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.960
And obviously not really.

296
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.160
Well, who was I to say, but didn't seem like a Sahaj Yogi to me.

297
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.240
So there I was matched with this gentleman.

298
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:02.480
And she sent us off sort of the window of the car rolled down.

299
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.360
And I think it was Yogi Mahajan who said, have you decided yet?

300
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.280
And we had literally just been announced, like I hadn't even met the person.

301
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.320
You have 24 hours kind of wagging a finger.

302
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.560
And I think Shri Mataji was in the back of the car.

303
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.080
And so off we went to, you know, get to know each other, etc.

304
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:25.800
So, yeah, to try to squeeze it into the time, the allotted time, I would just say I felt

305
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.480
there's no way I could marry this person.

306
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.560
And yet I can't say no to Shri Mataji.

307
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.880
So there's the situation.

308
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.920
I find myself in.

309
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.960
And then the next morning I woke up feeling, OK, come what may, you know, whether I get

310
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.040
thrown out of Sahaj, I just I just can't really marry this person.

311
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.040
It just doesn't feel like a Sahaj Yogi.

312
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.600
And so he said, oh, if you want to say no, that's great.

313
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.720
But you have to be the one to tell.

314
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.800
Because I already got in trouble for saying no to a foreigner.

315
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.200
You know, I don't particularly want to marry you either.

316
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.080
But, you know, I don't want to get the heat for it.

317
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.680
So he kind of packed me up on a jeep or a rickshaw or something and sent me off to the

318
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.560
ACDC huts where Shri Mataji was staying, you know, trembling all the way.

319
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.040
And then I arrived there and someone was just coming out of the place Shri Mataji was

320
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.280
staying. And, you know, what do you want kind of thing?

321
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.640
And I said, um, I just wanted to see Shri Mataji.

322
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.800
Oh, she's resting. You know, what do you want?

323
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:32.160
I said, I'm just kind of saying no to the match.

324
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.880
And he said, oh, Shri Mataji cancelled that ages ago.

325
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.840
She said he's not a Sahaj Yogi.

326
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.920
And she'll find you a nice tall boy or something like that.

327
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.640
Because earlier there was one other Maya where I was on stage.

328
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.800
There was four of us called up at the same time and she was kind of mixing and matching.

329
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.680
And I was next to one boy and the leader at the time said, oh, but Shri Mataji, these two

330
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.720
like each other and they know each other already.

331
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.360
And she said, OK.

332
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.400
And then that found me next to the very short boy.

333
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.160
So she said, you're very tall, aren't you?

334
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.240
And hence the I'll find you a nice tall boy comment.

335
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.880
So, yeah.

336
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.480
So then it was the night before the weddings.

337
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.320
There was no more announcements as such.

338
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.200
They were just throwing a last call for buying a wedding.

339
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.680
Sorry. And I thought, well, you know, I'll just go ask, I guess.

340
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:32.960
So I popped down and asked someone at the side of the stage, do you know if there's any, you know, going to be any more announcements or like just wondering if I should buy a sari or not?

341
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.720
And they said, oh, haven't you met Christian?

342
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.200
Like as if it was common knowledge that I was matched.

343
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.320
Haven't you met Christian?

344
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.080
Said no. And.

345
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.160
And then someone ran off to get Christian and Shri Mataji kind of beckoned for me to come up on the stage and.

346
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:55.480
Was sort of showing some saris and and then Christian arrived and we have two versions of how it happened.

347
00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.880
My version is she looked at me when he came and said, I chose this match myself.

348
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.240
And his version is her pointing to a sari and saying, I chose these saris myself.

349
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.480
So whichever one fits into your memory better.

350
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:17.040
So for me, but it was because there was another Maya of a leader arranging a match and that didn't really happen.

351
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.280
And so for me, that was just the last the last little stamp of approval from the Divine.

352
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.960
And so.

353
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.680
Yeah.

354
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.480
Yeah, we met and of course it was yes, right away, the weddings were the next day.

355
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.240
So there wasn't much time to think.

356
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.680
And then just the last little thing I remember is.

357
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:45.800
We were sitting after the marriages, we were sitting on those kind of steps made out of mud or whatever and that in particular, the kind of the rise.

358
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.880
And we were, you know, some steps back, definitely not within hearing distance.

359
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.320
And all of a sudden I just heard Shri Mataji say, Victoria.

360
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.760
And like I looked up and she was doing that with her hand, like come up here.

361
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.800
And I did that thing of like looking all around.

362
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.400
And but she definitely said my name.

363
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.320
So I sort of hopped down the steps and went up and went to her feet.

364
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:14.200
And she leaned over, kind of said, I just wanted to tell you that your shawl is on inside out.

365
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.160
Like, you know, those shawls where the embroidery is only on one side and it's all kind of loose threads on the other.

366
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.520
So she said, I just want to tell you your shawl is on the wrong way.

367
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.800
You know, it's your wedding day.

368
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.360
I want you to look your best.

369
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.440
And which was so sweet.

370
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.400
And again, that personal attention.

371
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.800
And we were one of, at the time, one of the most photographed couples ever.

372
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:42.640
It was just somehow everyone, Christiane, knew had a camera and they were all at every angle, your nose, your ear, your everything.

373
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.240
And she also finished with like, I hope someone was there to take pictures of you.

374
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.640
So many other stories.

375
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.120
I also met my beautiful mother-in-law on that very occasion.

376
00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:04.240
And yeah, so much, very beautiful memories.

377
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:11.440
And again, just the mother always finding what you need and when you need it.

378
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.600
And with all the grace and the love as well.

379
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.120
Yeah.

380
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.640
I just want to say, Victoria, it's resonating with me.

381
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.280
I don't know if you remember, but I was with you on that tour.

382
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.600
I do remember some of those little things that happened to you.

383
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:39.680
I mean, we don't see each other much now, but sometimes, you know, when we used to get together, we'd hear little things that had been, I don't remember all of it, but I was with you on that tour.

384
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.720
Oh, yay.

385
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760
Yeah.

386
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.240
I saw you get married and it was wonderful.

387
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280
Yeah.

388
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.840
Well, nice to see you.

389
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.360
Yeah, nice to see you.

390
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.800
Yes, very beautiful stories.

391
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.240
It's really talking about marriages.

392
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.640
I think it comes out so much from the heart.

393
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:05.680
It's been very, very nice hearing all these stories and nice to see Marie-Louise.

394
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.720
Yes.

395
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.680
So with that, we conclude.

396
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:17.160
The session and for next month, we have.

397
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200
Yes.

398
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:29.400
And October, we will be meeting again and any other couples or any other people would like to share their wedding stories.

399
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.440
That would be very nice.

400
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:39.920
Yes, we have we may have written record, but oral records, they have their own value.

401
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.440
You know, the feelings come forth.

402
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.160
It's really so precious.

403
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:51.080
We are recording them and we will see how we will share them.

404
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.200
So we can conclude.

405
00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.200
Is there anyone else who would like to make comment or ask any questions?

406
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.000
Hi, there's a question in the chat.

407
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.040
When is the next session and how do we get the link?

408
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.040
So we have a question.

409
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.040
Yes, I have a question.

410
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.040
Yes, I have a question.

411
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.040
Yes, I have a question.

412
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:21.000
When is the next session and how do we get the link?

413
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:28.000
OK, so the next session, these sessions are always on the second Wednesday of every month.

414
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:35.000
The links are posted on this early Yogi's group connect chat group.

415
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:46.000
And you can also send these invitations to other established Yogi's as many established Yogi's who would like to attend and listen to these.

416
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.000
Beautiful, very precious stories.

417
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:56.000
You're welcome to come by and join these sessions.

418
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.000
So just a question.

419
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.000
So if somebody is not on that group.

420
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.000
Yes.

421
00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.000
Yes.

422
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:11.000
So I just sent my phone number to the lady, a sister from Macedonia and any one of us.

423
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.960
I just put my number so you can contact us and we can add you to the cosmos and the bigger group.

424
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.960
Maybe somebody is new and not in the group yet.

425
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.960
So welcome.

426
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.960
And we are hoping to expand and hoping to have more brothers also.

427
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.960
It was so nice to hear in both of you.

428
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:40.960
So looking forward to more stories because it shows the complementarity and how the Param Chaitanya through Sri through the Adi Shakti knows.

429
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.960
How to balance out and get.

430
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.960
So I think it would be wonderful to actually have we've had in the past both husband and wife.

431
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.960
Yes.

432
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.960
So please spread the word and just any of us.
