00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.996
Announcement about speech and date

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:35.179
Today on the occasion of Mahashivratri I am going to tell you the importance of Shiva .You have to understand it.

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:51.375
Even though Shri Bramhadeva created this creation and in that creation [UNCLEAR] and evolution

00:00:51.375 --> 00:01:03.407
we got human birth and this human form is given to us by the power of Vishnu

00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:10.437
Even so, this human being has to attain the principle of Shiva.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:19.106
Finally Vishnu also has to worship Shri Shiva hence is the importance of Shiva.

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:24.814
Shiva Tattva (Principle) is our spirit.

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:36.926
all this effort, all this evolution is for knowing that principle which is Shiva Tattva,

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:44.007
Shiva Tattva is the Primodial Tattva, it is the principle of Sada Shiva,

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:53.587
it is Eternal, and from that all the other principles came out and human beings were created.

00:01:53.587 --> 00:02:01.666
Now human beings should know that Shiva who wished to make this creation

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:06.713
and create humans beings in it and those human beings should know God,

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:14.413
Have his power and should be engrossed in the joy of that power and in his work

00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:22.391
and he also wanted human beings experience it.

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:25.560
This has happened through Sahaja yoga.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.248
Even if you received your Realisation through Vishnu Tattva, what you obtain is Shiv Tattwa.

00:02:33.248 --> 00:02:37.596
This Shiva principle flows from the hand and we feel it as a Chaitanya Lahari(vibrations),

00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:50.664
this is the yoga you have attained Shiva has put his power, that is Shiva Shakti, we call it Mahakali Shakti,

00:02:50.664 --> 00:03:04.963
only a small part is put in every human being as kundalini which pierces the six chakras and ultimately unites with Shiva.

00:03:04.963 --> 00:03:08.432
This is the principle of Shiva.

00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:20.081
Shiva means the ocean of compassion, ocean of mercy, Treasure of love. This is all the principle of love.

00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:27.289
To know Shiva is to know the truth and he is the ocean of joy. Joy flows from him.

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:36.295
It is very easy to please Shiva. He is very naïve.

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:42.956
He is a love hungry lord (so) it is a very easy job.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.421
He never looks up, always looks down,

00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:56.292
He doesn’t see other useless things, so he sees only the devotees who are worshipping him at his feet

00:03:56.292 --> 00:04:06.690
[unclear] He is so much naive that even the demons also pleased Shiva.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:17.192
They were ready to serve him They did not want to displease Shiva whatever happens.

00:04:17.192 --> 00:04:23.790
With this cleverness they have pleased Shiva

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:43.832
(no voice ) ……..

00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:53.317
If they have overcome or awakened their Shiva principle a little too much and have pleased Shiva,

00:04:53.317 --> 00:05:03.340
they are doing whatever they like,thinking that no matter what they do, their existence cannot be destroyed easily.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:11.554
Today you should seek that Shiva Tattva in your prayer that now open the eyes,

00:05:11.554 --> 00:05:19.053
open the third eye and see with those eyes all the demons should be destroyed

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:24.536
The devotees have suffered a lot , they have been troubled a lot

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:28.404
and now the devotees have come to that state where only they have authority over Shiva

00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:34.080
If you do such a prayer to Shiva today is a great day,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:42.401
then that Shiva Tattva will give you a great blessing

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:48.207
and that blessing will be for the well being of the whole world

00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:53.744
We have all the right, all the desires to take his blessing,

00:05:53.744 --> 00:06:01.521
so we should take his blessing today similarly, we should take the blessings today for our own Shiva tattva also.

00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:10.563
The Shiva principle is the principle of the spirit itself which is detached,tranquil and saintly.

00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:18.291
When one’s attention is on his spirit , then he progresses very well

00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:27.257
One should always worship the spirit within, the self, the inner spirit,

00:06:27.257 --> 00:06:32.905
Attention should be on the spirit so that we get detached from what is happening outside.

00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:34.800
Everything outside is all an illusion.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.238
Bramha Tattva is the thrill of Shiva’s body

00:06:38.238 --> 00:06:42.676
So our aim should be just to please Shiva and we do not want anything else.

00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:49.946
That’s what we want to experience, that’s what we want to enjoy, that’s how we want to look at the world.

00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:56.129
so we should see the outside world through the eyes of the spirit. we should pray to God for ourselves in this manner.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:04.818
That means, slowly, after getting rid of the external worries, you will become one with the principles,

00:07:04.818 --> 00:07:08.648
you will live in the principles. The principle is not attached to anything,

00:07:08.648 --> 00:07:14.072
it is detached and disinterested and then there is only joy everywhere.

00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:16.126
There is no limit to that joy.

00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:23.649
For that, we should not show anything outside that we have discarded this and that, it goes away from within

00:07:23.649 --> 00:07:32.844
and our attention is completely absorbed in that Shiva Tattva..

00:07:32.844 --> 00:07:35.126
I bless you that all of you attain that state today.

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:39.255
Today you should do this Shiva puja very humbly

00:07:39.255 --> 00:07:49.340
and get the most important thing for which all this Sahaja Yoga is built and I hope you all will get it.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:08:04.944
It must first be holy The second thing after sanctification is our Kundalini.

00:08:04.944 --> 00:08:11.105
Kundalini as just now I said that Sadashiva has installed his Shakti which is Kundalini. It is Mahakali’s Shakti.

00:08:11.105 --> 00:08:14.126
All the other Shaktis come out the Mahakali Shakti

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:20.657
and some fraction of it, is the Kundalini Shakti..

00:08:20.657 --> 00:08:27.351
And it is sitting in the triangular bone. But she is Gauri Swaroop which means she is still chaste.

00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:32.846
she is still married but she is still a virgin waiting for a husband

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:41.228
so this is Kundalini And that Kundalini has created Ganesha, as the sacred protector.

00:08:41.228 --> 00:08:46.824
Now we have appealed to Gauri i.e. Virgin girl .

00:08:46.824 --> 00:08:54.091
And after that, which way should she go now, it is Mahalakshmi’s way, She has to go through Shushumana path.

00:08:54.091 --> 00:09:03.196
And through Shushumana paths she met Shri SadaShiva at the Feet of Sadashiva meaning that the Divine Shiva Tattva, which resides in the heart, was satisfied.

00:09:03.196 --> 00:09:08.578
It gets satisfies. It shines and becomes enlightened Its only then that our yoga happens.

00:09:08.578 --> 00:09:13.270
So, first of all, before reaching Shiva, we should understand his path.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.872
So now Mahalakshmi should be invoked.

00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:21.758
After the invocation of Mahalakshmi, then we will come into the state of Shiva.

00:09:21.758 --> 00:09:27.687
And this is by Kundalini, and Kundalini is Shiva Shakti.

00:09:27.687 --> 00:09:35.633
This is the power of Shiva, that is, it is the power of Mahakali and it is sitting in our triangular bone

00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:48.150
But then, Shiva Shakti, mounts on Mahalakshmi path and rises and gets one with Shiva. It happens like this.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:10:04.672
It means always Lakshmi should worship Parvati or Shiva has always given boon and Vishnu has always worshipped Him.

00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:09.065
Thus we have to understand that Shiv tattwa is the highest.

00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:19.071
… and innocence on this earth.

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:28.652
Then we worship Gauri, that is the Kundalini, because through Kundalini only we get to our ascent.

00:10:28.652 --> 00:10:35.875
Kundalini is the power, residual power, of the Mahakali.

00:10:35.875 --> 00:10:48.220
And She is settled in the triangular bone, as you know, and is worshipped as a “Kanya”, because though She is married, yet She’s a Virgin, so She’s worshipped there.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:11:00.447
After that, the Kundalini has to rise through the central path of Sushumna which is guarded and nurtured by Mahalakshmi,

00:11:00.447 --> 00:11:05.691
so we have to worship Mahalakshmi’s force, that’s how we worship Her.

00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:13.221
Through the Mahalakshmi we prepare the path for Kundalini to cross over;

00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:21.694
when the Kundalini crosses the Mahalakshmi path, it comes up to the Sahasrara and breaks the Brahmarandra,

00:11:21.694 --> 00:11:26.194
becoming One with the All Pervading Power of Shiva Tattva,

00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:36.800
because Sadashiva is on our fontanelle bone – is, His Legs are resting on our fontanelle bone area.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:52.075
When the Kundalini touches His feet, then the Shiva Tattva in our heart, which is the Spirit, is enlightened and we get the enlightenment.

00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:57.268
This is the yoga which we achieve through our Sahaja system

00:11:57.268 --> 00:12:01.971
– and that is why we have now worshipped the Mahalakshmi.

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:15.000
After that, now we have to in… we have to invite, avahana as they call it, inovation; invite the deity of Shiva and Parvati,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:29.679
and then we have to put our hearts to pour its love, which is called as “abhisheka”, through the symbol of water.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:43.810
The… the water container is like a heart which pours the water all the time on the Feet, showing that it is our heart which is pouring our love on Shiva,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.040
by which we win Him over and call Him, invite Him.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:55.967
And after that, we will give Him what He likes the most, is the Bel Patra,

00:12:55.967 --> 00:13:07.455
which is a leaf which has got three leaves on one stem, which means His three powers, Trigunatmika, three powers.

00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:14.025
So with our three powers, ours trigunas, our three powers, we surrender ourselves to Shiva

00:13:14.025 --> 00:13:22.970
and by that we show that we give our trigunas to You, so that we become gunateet.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.013
This is what is the Shiva puja.

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:31.073
May God bless you!
