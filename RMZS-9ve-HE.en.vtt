05:27.280 --> 05:36.040
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

05:36.880 --> 05:42.360
It is said about him, that

05:42.560 --> 05:48.960
He is the first deity that was created on this earth

05:49.160 --> 05:57.240
by Adi Shakti.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.800
And about his creation, you know the story.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.880
And also you know

06:07.080 --> 06:12.400
how an elephant´s head was attached to him.

06:14.400 --> 06:20.720
Today, I am going to tell something more subtler

06:20.960 --> 06:29.600
about him, Kundalini and the Mother Earth.

06:29.880 --> 06:34.080
He was made out of the Mother Earth,

06:37.280 --> 06:42.080
with the vibrations of his Mother.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.320
Now, the significance of Mother Earth,

06:48.520 --> 06:51.760
we have never understood.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.800
Now look at the Mother Earth,

06:57.040 --> 07:02.960
She is the one who produces all kinds of

07:03.200 --> 07:08.120
beautiful flowers of different fragrance,

07:08.320 --> 07:15.280
of different nature, color, heights.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.680
The trees are different.

07:18.960 --> 07:23.720
Trees, when they grow up,

07:23.920 --> 07:29.160
they grow in such a manner that every leaf,

07:31.040 --> 07:35.440
every leaf of that tree, gets the sun.

07:35.640 --> 07:39.160
Look at the collective sense

07:39.360 --> 07:44.400
which is given to us by this Mother Earth.

07:44.600 --> 07:49.480
We have never realized that this Mother Earth,

07:49.680 --> 07:55.280
which is giving us everything that we want

07:55.480 --> 07:59.040
and the sun helps the Mother Earth,

07:59.240 --> 08:02.760
cooperates, coordinates with Her.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.600
To go further with it, you have seen that picture

08:08.800 --> 08:13.840
where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth,

08:14.040 --> 08:17.520
and half of it is seen.

08:19.080 --> 08:24.280
So what does this Kundalini do for us?

08:24.480 --> 08:28.240
Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?

08:29.000 --> 08:35.480
The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection,

08:35.800 --> 08:40.960
and what does She do within us,

08:41.160 --> 08:45.960
to build us up in which way?

08:46.320 --> 08:50.600
So it is the primordial power

08:51.040 --> 08:54.560
which is coming out of the Mother Earth.

08:54.760 --> 08:59.000
Mother Earth itself acts like a Mother,

08:59.240 --> 09:03.080
She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want,

09:03.280 --> 09:05.600
and another miraculous thing is

09:05.800 --> 09:09.240
that the highest tree is a coconut tree,

09:09.440 --> 09:11.680
and a coconut will never fall

09:11.880 --> 09:16.280
on any creature or any human being.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.960
That means it´s all thinking,

09:19.160 --> 09:21.840
all understanding, all consciousness,

09:22.040 --> 09:26.160
all awareness is coming from the Mother Earth.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.360
But we never understand.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.200
As it is we take it for granted.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.160
Now what does She do for us, for us human beings?

09:41.560 --> 09:44.640
She´s the primordial power.

09:44.840 --> 09:50.440
What she does is to build in us a primordial

09:50.640 --> 09:53.240
– what we can call – restrictions

09:53.440 --> 09:58.360
or primordial taboos or primordial dharmas.

10:00.800 --> 10:05.680
For example, you see the steel is here.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.040
It has its own dharma,

10:08.240 --> 10:11.640
it cannot behave like wood.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.120
Wood has its own dharma,

10:14.320 --> 10:20.160
it cannot behave like silver.

10:20.360 --> 10:27.800
They all have their dharma and they are bound in that dharma.

10:29.400 --> 10:33.760
Everything that is in the nature has its own dharma.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.720
If you see the tiger, if you see the lion,

10:36.920 --> 10:41.960
if you see a mongoose or if you see a snake,

10:42.160 --> 10:46.440
they all have their dharma, their style, their everything.

10:46.640 --> 10:51.440
It´s very surprising, how they are bound by it.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.920
Once in Prathisthan,

10:54.120 --> 10:57.760
I went from the other side to my bedroom,

10:58.080 --> 11:02.400
and I saw a very big snake came out of a hole.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.760
Of course I was quite away from it,

11:04.960 --> 11:08.240
but it felt my vibrations and started running away.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.880
It fell in the swimming pool and it wouldn´t come out.

11:12.080 --> 11:16.400
So somebody went down and killed it

11:16.880 --> 11:18.960
and brought his body up there.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.440
I was surprised; it was such a big one, about six feet,

11:23.640 --> 11:30.280
but it intertwined itself in a very beautiful pattern,

11:30.760 --> 11:34.200
surprisingly, when it was there. Alright.

11:34.800 --> 11:39.720
Then what they did, they said that, “Mother, if we leave it,

11:39.920 --> 11:44.840
it will fall in the water and again it will come to life,

11:45.040 --> 11:47.240
so what should we do?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.800
I said “Let it be then. What do you do?"

11:50.000 --> 11:53.920
They said “we burn it”. So they burned the snake.

11:54.400 --> 12:01.160
But the female of the snake came out after 10 days.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.440
They said “there must be a female”,

12:03.640 --> 12:05.960
and she was searching for him

12:06.160 --> 12:08.800
when suddenly somebody saw her.

12:09.040 --> 12:13.080
They killed her also, they killed her

12:13.240 --> 12:16.760
and she also made the same kind of a pattern.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.280
I was amazed,

12:18.480 --> 12:20.200
very beautiful pattern

12:20.400 --> 12:24.160
of the body going round, like this, like this, like this.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.480
Exactly the same, she also made.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.560
So I was surprised

12:30.760 --> 12:35.280
how is it that this lady knows how

12:35.480 --> 12:37.600
to copy her husband?

12:37.800 --> 12:40.720
She did it, and when we burnt her,

12:40.920 --> 12:44.280
she was finished of course, both of them were killed.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.920
But what I felt is that animals,

12:49.480 --> 12:53.360
creepers, those who creep permanently,

12:53.560 --> 12:57.760
other people also, every type of animal,

12:58.040 --> 13:03.560
the whole of biology I studied, I was amazed

13:03.760 --> 13:09.560
that every type of animal has the exact,

13:09.760 --> 13:13.760
the same sample of behavior.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.280
For example, you can put the dog in the water

13:19.480 --> 13:22.960
he´ll swim, but the cat may not.

13:23.200 --> 13:28.200
See it´s a thing that is built in, the dharma,

13:28.400 --> 13:33.440
what I call the primordial taboos.

13:34.120 --> 13:38.400
We have in the same way, primordial taboos

13:38.600 --> 13:43.200
built within us, which are dharma.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.640
A human being has to be like that.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.600
If he tries to be something else

13:50.800 --> 13:53.560
something goes wrong with his life.

13:53.760 --> 13:57.360
It´s like say if you, you have a glass,

13:57.560 --> 14:01.760
you drop it on the ground, it will break, that is the dharma.

14:01.960 --> 14:05.320
In the same way when human beings

14:05.520 --> 14:09.360
start deviating from the line of dharma,

14:09.560 --> 14:11.760
they get into trouble.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.480
But it is only human beings who can do that.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.240
They can only cross over these taboos, these primordial taboos,

14:20.440 --> 14:23.920
and can become horrible.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.320
You see a person,

14:26.520 --> 14:30.400
sometimes I wonder what´s wrong with him.

14:31.480 --> 14:36.240
He has a nice home, very good wife, everything,

14:36.440 --> 14:41.720
then he has a keep (another woman), what is the need?

14:41.920 --> 14:44.880
For a man it is primordial that he should have

14:45.080 --> 14:50.680
only one wife, and she, one husband.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.520
It´s a taboo, as soon as you deviate from that

14:55.720 --> 14:58.320
something goes wrong.

14:59.040 --> 15:03.240
Now who punishes, or who corrects or who destroys

15:03.440 --> 15:10.120
is this primordial power which we call as Paramchaitanya.

15:13.600 --> 15:19.200
If you can understand that it´s a structure.

15:19.400 --> 15:24.520
Say this is the structure of this hangar,

15:24.720 --> 15:28.520
now you want to break it, you can break it

15:28.720 --> 15:31.320
because you are human beings,

15:31.520 --> 15:33.840
but it will be broken.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.720
As simple as that,

15:35.920 --> 15:39.400
we have to understand we are human beings

15:39.600 --> 15:41.800
and we cannot do things

15:42.000 --> 15:46.320
which go against our dharma.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.160
Now why the dharma?

15:49.360 --> 15:54.240
Dharma has to be there for our ascent.

15:55.640 --> 16:00.960
Now man, in his intelligence and his progressiveness

16:01.160 --> 16:05.800
thinks that anything he does – what´s wrong?

16:06.080 --> 16:09.440
Especially in the west, this is very common.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.080
But I must say, for the aboriginal people,

16:13.280 --> 16:15.640
or people who are,

16:15.840 --> 16:19.240
I mean I don´t know if I should call Indians aboriginal or not.

16:19.440 --> 16:23.400
But those people who were made aware

16:23.600 --> 16:28.120
of their primordial taboos somehow.

16:28.960 --> 16:33.480
As the animals know what is bad for them

16:34.280 --> 16:42.520
and that knowledge was there with aboriginals.

16:42.720 --> 16:47.520
Today we are here with Australians,

16:47.720 --> 16:53.080
and in Australia aboriginals are so many

16:53.280 --> 16:58.400
I was surprised, most of their words were Sanskrit.

16:58.600 --> 17:04.520
So might be they might have got it from India,

17:04.720 --> 17:08.080
or maybe they have gone there from India.

17:08.280 --> 17:12.960
So many words they have got which are Sanskrit.

17:13.520 --> 17:18.720
So I started thinking about them.

17:19.040 --> 17:23.240
Normally aboriginals, say in India we have aboriginals.

17:23.440 --> 17:28.760
We call them “gorn, korku, peel”.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.760
We had a lady who was a maid with us,

17:33.960 --> 17:36.320
Gaynabai was her name,

17:36.520 --> 17:38.440
she was an excellent cook,

17:38.640 --> 17:42.600
but she had her maryadas.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.200
All the time, like if my father came

17:46.400 --> 17:48.760
she would immediately cover her head

17:48.960 --> 17:52.120
and go in the other room, to respect him.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.760
Nobody told her to do that.

17:59.400 --> 18:04.840
Their marriage system was also very surprisingly good,

18:05.120 --> 18:08.320
and their relationships with the children also was very good.

18:08.520 --> 18:12.960
Somehow or another in my childhood I met many of them

18:13.160 --> 18:16.280
because I also had a habit of going to the jungles

18:16.480 --> 18:18.440
where I used to meet them

18:18.640 --> 18:21.520
and I was surprised, they would not drink

18:21.720 --> 18:27.400
this I´m telling you was about 60 years back, maybe more.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.400
They would not drink,

18:29.640 --> 18:35.120
very “lajashi” means shame of everything.

18:35.320 --> 18:40.760
A matter of, sort of prestige, for them was important.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.040
They would never steal anything,

18:44.240 --> 18:46.960
and I was really very impressed,

18:47.200 --> 18:50.080
how these people were so dharmic,

18:50.280 --> 18:52.520
so good and happy.

18:52.720 --> 18:55.520
They lived in huts, they didn´t mind,

18:55.720 --> 18:59.920
but they were very clean and neat people.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.880
It is now changed.

19:06.240 --> 19:10.200
The same people have changed so much.

19:18.480 --> 19:23.120
I mean they were like sacred people, I tell you, holy people.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.120
They worship Mother,

19:27.320 --> 19:31.440
they worship Mother Earth, nothing else,

19:31.800 --> 19:35.440
and I asked this lady “why do you worship Mother Earth?”.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.040
She said “she gives us everything.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.440
She is a just Mother,

19:40.640 --> 19:44.040
we live in the jungles, she looks after us,

19:44.240 --> 19:49.280
and she is the most conscious person,

19:49.480 --> 19:54.000
she knows that we are there and she has to look after us”.

19:55.680 --> 20:02.480
Even to take out some leaves from the trees,

20:02.680 --> 20:06.440
they used to think about it.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.320
But then the missionaries came,

20:09.520 --> 20:11.840
they converted them,

20:12.040 --> 20:13.760
they gave them skirts and blouses

20:13.960 --> 20:16.120
and I don´t know what all they did.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.920
But Gaynabai did not take,

20:18.120 --> 20:20.000
she said “what is this?”

20:20.200 --> 20:22.360
Why should I wear a dress like this

20:22.560 --> 20:24.880
where the whole body is exposed?

20:25.080 --> 20:28.640
No I´ll wear a sari, I can never give it up.

20:28.840 --> 20:32.600
Why should I wear this kind of a useless dress?”

20:32.800 --> 20:39.720
But when they met with these so called advanced people

20:39.920 --> 20:44.400
so many of them started living like that.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.120
They said “you have no freedom;

20:48.320 --> 20:51.880
you are just bound by something, by someone”.

20:52.080 --> 20:57.040
But actually they were bound by the sacredness,

20:57.240 --> 21:01.400
by the divine understanding

21:01.600 --> 21:05.160
and then they started changing.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.200
She was alright, her husband was alright

21:08.400 --> 21:10.640
but her son started drinking,

21:10.840 --> 21:12.720
this is the beginning of the end,

21:12.920 --> 21:17.960
then gambling and all other sorts of things he started.

21:18.160 --> 21:23.960
Then her grandson started going to prostitutes,

21:25.200 --> 21:29.320
and the idea was only that “we are free,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.960
what´s wrong?”

21:34.960 --> 21:37.320
Now these primordial taboos

21:37.520 --> 21:42.240
are in you, built in. They are there.

21:43.480 --> 21:49.320
These are existing maybe in a potential state,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.280
maybe you have curbed them down,

21:51.480 --> 21:55.160
maybe you have turned them out,

21:55.840 --> 21:58.160
but they are there.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.480
All the time they are there,

22:02.200 --> 22:07.160
and that´s what we say that you are leaving the maryadas,

22:07.360 --> 22:12.400
or else we say that you are insulting Shri Ganesh.

22:12.600 --> 22:17.840
So when Mother created this universe,

22:18.040 --> 22:23.280
first deity was Shri Ganesh.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.120
Auspiciousness was created.

22:28.320 --> 22:32.320
Now, we don´t understand what is auspiciousness.

22:32.560 --> 22:40.000
Auspiciousness is a complete understanding

22:40.200 --> 22:52.200
of primordial restrictions, and also of the protocol.

22:54.440 --> 22:58.480
For example, in India we all used to do that,

22:58.680 --> 23:02.200
though I was in a Christian family,

23:02.400 --> 23:04.760
that before touching the Mother Earth,

23:04.960 --> 23:07.040
getting up from the bed,

23:07.240 --> 23:10.320
we used to say “Oh Mother Earth, please forgive us

23:10.520 --> 23:14.640
because we are touching you with our feet”.

23:17.160 --> 23:21.440
So respect for the Mother Earth and for nature

23:21.640 --> 23:23.280
is built in within us,

23:23.480 --> 23:28.040
it´s part and parcel, we are part and parcel of this whole

23:28.240 --> 23:32.960
we can call it whole universe.

23:33.400 --> 23:40.400
But when you get into this nonsensical idea of freedom

23:40.760 --> 23:45.520
then you are leaving your Mother Earth,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.080
your gravity itself reduces.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.600
This Mother Earth has to teach us,

23:57.440 --> 23:59.720
while we are plundering everything,

23:59.920 --> 24:02.880
the ecology, their ecology – ecology people are trying.

24:03.080 --> 24:07.000
Whatever is outside is also inside.

24:07.200 --> 24:12.480
If you want to exploit your Mother inside,

24:12.680 --> 24:16.880
or if you want to trouble your Mother inside,

24:17.080 --> 24:21.360
you can also trouble this Mother Earth.

24:22.400 --> 24:30.480
Now what has replaced our understanding is very simple,

24:30.680 --> 24:42.240
is that we are paying more attention to money.

24:44.160 --> 24:48.600
If you can cut a tree you say, to get money,

24:49.080 --> 24:52.360
then it is hurting the Mother.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.240
But if you are cutting the tree for beautifying her,

24:56.440 --> 24:58.440
then she´s happy.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.920
Her discretion is so great,

25:02.120 --> 25:06.280
see the way she produces flowers.

25:06.480 --> 25:09.080
Different, different types of flowers.

25:09.280 --> 25:13.520
In different countries, different types of flowers.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.160
Like I saw in my country

25:16.360 --> 25:19.920
that flowers are extremely fragrant,

25:20.400 --> 25:22.840
very fragrant.

25:23.040 --> 25:30.080
And she understands so much.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.600
Once I went to Australia

25:33.960 --> 25:37.600
and this flower you call hibiscus,

25:39.480 --> 25:43.360
it´s a red flower, it becomes pink and then red,

25:43.560 --> 25:46.400
imagine it becomes first pink

25:46.600 --> 25:49.320
and then gradually it becomes red.

25:49.520 --> 25:54.400
Even the sunflower goes on turning its face with the sun.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.200
Now how can you say there is no connection

25:57.400 --> 26:01.400
between a sunflower and the sun?

26:02.080 --> 26:05.520
Automatically it goes on changing.

26:06.160 --> 26:10.920
So these hibiscus flowers are the flowers

26:11.120 --> 26:15.040
which we use to worship Shri Ganesh,

26:15.240 --> 26:19.400
and the program was to worship Shri Ganesh.

26:19.600 --> 26:25.960
On the way I saw so many trees of hibiscus, just flowering.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.760
I said “at this time so many flowers”.

26:29.960 --> 26:34.600
I said “I think you´d better get these flowers for the puja”.

26:34.800 --> 26:40.920
I went and when I arrived in the hall

26:41.120 --> 26:46.360
all the Sahaja Yogis had got hibiscus on their own.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.480
I never talked to them, just on their own.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.760
They didn´t know that it is to be used for Shri Ganesh

26:52.960 --> 26:57.600
but the Mother Earth herself created at that time.

26:58.680 --> 27:03.880
This is the time of Shri Ganesh when you should get hibiscus.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.560
It´s very remarkable

27:07.760 --> 27:11.800
how the nature is so much within us

27:11.960 --> 27:15.480
and how this, whatever it is within us,

27:15.680 --> 27:21.240
guides outside and receives the blessings.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.160
We are not something separate.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.600
This Mother Earth is our home,

27:27.800 --> 27:33.720
we have a home in her and she has a home within us.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.080
I said today that for Shri Ganesha,

27:38.280 --> 27:40.800
He had a body of the clay,

27:40.960 --> 27:43.160
just ordinary clay.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.920
So you can imagine,

27:46.120 --> 27:48.200
if you can really think of it,

27:48.400 --> 27:54.400
how this whole universe has created us;

27:56.400 --> 27:59.360
all of it is within us

27:59.560 --> 28:03.360
and when we try to hurt something,

28:05.040 --> 28:09.440
then we are hurting ourselves.

28:11.640 --> 28:15.600
The intelligence of Mother Earth

28:15.800 --> 28:19.120
I have seen from my childhood.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.800
It´s such a beautiful thing to know the nature

28:26.000 --> 28:27.320
and the Mother Earth

28:27.520 --> 28:30.840
that´s why all the saints, in India especially,

28:31.040 --> 28:34.400
used to go and live in the forest.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.680
Only in the forest you could see clearly

28:38.880 --> 28:47.920
how this primordial bondage was absolutely obeyed,

28:48.120 --> 28:52.720
absolutely obeyed, naturally by the nature.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.280
For us it is difficult,

28:56.480 --> 29:02.000
we are rather, “free” people.

29:04.120 --> 29:10.840
So simple things, simple things like a woman

29:11.520 --> 29:16.680
should be always covered properly in her body.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.280
Because she respects her body,

29:19.480 --> 29:21.960
she respects her chastity.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.720
But if you tell this to somebody

29:24.920 --> 29:26.960
they won´t listen.

29:27.160 --> 29:31.920
As you see the evergreens, they are always clad,

29:33.240 --> 29:35.560
no leaf falls off.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.600
I call them as the females,

29:39.800 --> 29:42.960
and the other trees, deciduous,

29:43.160 --> 29:49.000
they do lose their leaves so I call them as men.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.040
Because they are men.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.640
Here it´s the other way round, I have seen.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.520
If I used to go to any party

29:56.720 --> 30:00.200
somehow or another they thought I was a very serene person,

30:00.400 --> 30:02.040
you meet someone, immediately

30:02.240 --> 30:05.120
the man will button up himself

30:05.320 --> 30:08.120
and the women will open themselves.

30:08.320 --> 30:12.160
I said the whole brain from here has gone to this side

30:12.360 --> 30:14.960
and this one has gone this side.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.840
It´s so stupid.

30:18.040 --> 30:21.440
But even Mrs. Thatcher they said that she said,

30:21.640 --> 30:27.400
that it is our culture that women must expose their bodies.

30:27.600 --> 30:31.840
For what? Are they prostitutes or what?

30:35.360 --> 30:38.840
So this craze of exposure of the body

30:39.040 --> 30:43.680
has become so strong now that even in India,

30:43.880 --> 30:46.520
it´s not on the streets or in the household,

30:46.720 --> 30:49.400
but in the cinema, in films, you see women,

30:49.600 --> 30:52.320
really this never happens in India.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.960
What you see in the films, never happens!

30:55.160 --> 30:57.080
If they start wearing dresses like that

30:57.280 --> 31:01.120
so many people will throw stones at them.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.400
Then all other sorts of,

31:07.880 --> 31:12.680
I shouldn´t say clumpsy but very grotesque

31:12.880 --> 31:18.320
things happened, like, I can´t understand

31:18.520 --> 31:23.680
man having relation with man, woman having relation with woman,

31:23.880 --> 31:27.840
and children, and this and that and that.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.960
We didn´t know these things in India, I didn´t know.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.960
Why? Why has it happened here?

31:36.160 --> 31:39.560
I don´t think 50 years back they used to do that,

31:39.760 --> 31:42.440
also in these countries.

31:42.640 --> 31:47.120
Why have we given up our sense of shame?

31:47.320 --> 31:51.160
And this kind of nonsense that has come into us.

31:51.320 --> 31:55.640
I think must be some bhoots in them or badhas in them

31:55.840 --> 31:57.320
or something horrible,

31:57.520 --> 32:01.320
but this is something absolutely unnatural.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.400
Absurd!

32:06.040 --> 32:10.920
Then a married man having eyes on unmarried women

32:11.120 --> 32:17.600
and unmarried men are having relations.

32:17.800 --> 32:21.240
All kinds of things people do.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.920
And you won´t believe, this doesn´t happen in India.

32:26.120 --> 32:31.320
Really I tell you, these days it sort of spread out,

32:31.520 --> 32:36.800
but I would say in good families you don´t have it.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.480
Somebody told me there is AIDS in India,

32:39.680 --> 32:43.040
yes because they take bath in the river.

32:43.240 --> 32:47.840
If they stopped taking bath in the river this will stop.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.960
I was a medical student, I have studied,

32:51.160 --> 32:53.560
I came from a very open family,

32:53.760 --> 32:55.720
I never knew these things,

32:55.920 --> 33:00.080
that men can do such things, it´s stupid!

33:01.920 --> 33:04.600
Even in the lunatic asylum in India

33:04.800 --> 33:07.440
we have never heard of such reports.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.920
This is absurd!!

33:17.760 --> 33:20.440
You see the children.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.760
The other day Guido gave me a present of a girl,

33:23.960 --> 33:25.520
who was feeling shy,

33:25.720 --> 33:29.520
you know, the little girl was holding her frock like this and feeling shy.

33:30.000 --> 33:37.560
Shyness is the ornament of women.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.080
Children are all shy.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.560
I remember my granddaughter

33:43.760 --> 33:47.960
she was once watching one magazine,

33:48.200 --> 33:51.440
she was very small, two years or so.

33:51.640 --> 33:56.120
So she saw one woman in a bikini or something,

33:56.320 --> 33:58.440
she was hitting her, “what are you doing?”

33:58.640 --> 33:59.960
She saw in the magazine.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.760
My grandmother will come

34:02.960 --> 34:05.280
and give you two slaps, you shut up!

34:05.480 --> 34:07.320
Please wear your dresses”.

34:07.520 --> 34:11.920
They would not. Children don´t like, have you noticed it.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.920
I don´t know if they are advanced,

34:15.120 --> 34:20.080
but normally children don´t like it, this shamelessness.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.240
But the shamelessness has gone,

34:23.440 --> 34:25.880
to such an extent

34:26.080 --> 34:31.760
that to them keeping nude is a very great advancement.

34:36.360 --> 34:41.120
This is nothing.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.720
Somebody told me that he wanted to save the aboriginals

34:46.920 --> 34:49.440
but they were so much,

34:49.640 --> 34:55.400
so much impressed by the white skin,

34:55.600 --> 34:57.800
that they accepted everything.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.120
But they were even having relations

35:00.320 --> 35:04.160
with their own sister, daughter, mother.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.160
Competition.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.880
These are the subjects,

35:12.080 --> 35:14.920
it´s rather heinous to talk about,

35:15.120 --> 35:18.680
and I can´t understand

35:18.880 --> 35:23.440
how can a human being go to that level.

35:24.160 --> 35:30.200
And at this time we have Sahaja Yoga,

35:32.840 --> 35:36.320
where you have become aware, aware

35:36.520 --> 35:40.600
of your natural taboos.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.800
It is there, because I told you, potentially it is there,

35:43.960 --> 35:48.280
it is enlightened and suddenly you have accepted.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.600
I never expected so much, I tell you,

35:51.800 --> 35:55.360
but you have accepted it,

35:56.120 --> 35:59.000
and not only that, but you are enjoying it,

35:59.200 --> 36:01.880
your practicing it.

36:03.560 --> 36:07.800
You see the lives of all the great saints.

36:10.560 --> 36:14.480
You can´t have something, like Diana,

36:14.680 --> 36:16.600
see, they are going to call her a saint.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.640
She had no maryadas.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.040
Oh I have sympathies with her because

36:22.240 --> 36:24.840
her husband tortured her or maybe something,

36:25.040 --> 36:29.200
but maryadas are very important.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.520
How can she be a saint?

36:32.720 --> 36:38.160
Now if you become just an ordinary human being

36:38.360 --> 36:43.720
who has his taboos, who understands, who is aware,

36:44.600 --> 36:47.920
then they will say, “Oh what a man he was”,

36:48.120 --> 36:51.160
I mean that´s what he was,

36:51.360 --> 36:53.320
he was born like that,

36:53.520 --> 36:57.840
so such a man is praised, in the West especially.

36:58.040 --> 37:01.200
Also the other way round is that,

37:01.400 --> 37:05.200
now the majority is the law.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.280
If the majority is stupid,

37:08.480 --> 37:13.880
then all the stupidity is regarded as great.

37:14.600 --> 37:19.680
They have no brains they have no intelligence

37:19.880 --> 37:23.360
to understand how can these things help;

37:23.560 --> 37:26.320
alcohol for example.

37:26.520 --> 37:32.040
I mean alcohol, it has done no good to anyone,

37:32.840 --> 37:38.880
but alcohol, without alcohol you are no good.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.640
They won´t talk to you they say that

37:40.840 --> 37:44.720
unless you have alcohol you cannot talk.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.240
And it is so rampant,

37:49.440 --> 37:53.280
it is so much in the society

37:53.480 --> 37:55.880
that all the parties I attended,

37:56.080 --> 37:59.880
except for me and my husband, everybody was drinking,

38:00.080 --> 38:05.400
and drinking much more than normal because it was free.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.040
They are all poisons,

38:09.240 --> 38:11.720
these are all poisons

38:11.880 --> 38:18.320
spoiling us completely from one to another.

38:18.520 --> 38:25.640
This one is a taboo now, for cigarettes,

38:25.840 --> 38:29.680
imagine – why to smoke?

38:29.880 --> 38:34.120
I don´t understand, like a chimney people are smoking.

38:34.320 --> 38:38.960
But they have no courage to give it up now.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.200
Everywhere, no smoke, no smoke, no smoke.

38:42.400 --> 38:48.720
When will they start “no alcohol?”

38:50.600 --> 38:55.920
Everybody sees that it´s so dangerous.

38:56.120 --> 38:59.640
It is against human awareness, everybody sees it.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.440
You see people falling down,

39:01.640 --> 39:06.120
you see people cursing each other, fighting.

39:06.320 --> 39:09.840
I tell you, if you stop this alcoholism

39:10.040 --> 39:14.160
all this shamelessness will go away.

39:14.840 --> 39:18.920
Because when you take alcohol your awareness is abated.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.760
One alcoholic told me

39:20.960 --> 39:26.320
“when I take alcohol I don´t see my sister as my sister,

39:26.520 --> 39:30.160
but see her as my beloved”.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.200
Well how do you do that? “Yes”.

39:34.520 --> 39:40.760
But for all social status and all that you must drink.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.920
Now, we don´t even understand how

39:44.120 --> 39:50.680
our primordial taboos are completely battered

39:50.880 --> 39:54.520
by the society here.

39:56.360 --> 40:02.120
The simple thing is that

40:09.720 --> 40:16.960
to understand your own self,

40:17.160 --> 40:21.280
better sometimes to see the stupid people,

40:21.480 --> 40:25.640
you´ll be amazed what sort of things they are doing

40:25.800 --> 40:29.040
because I have seen, I used to be very amazed

40:29.240 --> 40:31.720
what are they doing?

40:31.920 --> 40:36.360
And then to cover it up, to cover it up,

40:37.640 --> 40:43.000
they have etiquettes you know, very elite.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.360
They talk in a very special manner,

40:46.560 --> 40:50.680
move themselves in a very,

40:52.760 --> 40:58.040
I should say, like a trained personality

40:58.240 --> 41:06.040
and anybody who doesn´t do that is out of their sight.

41:06.680 --> 41:11.680
They think that He lacks eliteness.

41:13.240 --> 41:19.800
So another idea is that we have to be elite.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.760
Ganesha is how made – you see that.

41:27.760 --> 41:33.040
Look at him, He´s by no means elite.

41:33.720 --> 41:38.440
He eats like a glutton

41:43.360 --> 41:48.520
and He looks at you

41:48.720 --> 41:55.960
as if He´s going to hit you with his mace.

41:59.760 --> 42:07.040
For Ganesha there is no forgiveness,

42:07.240 --> 42:13.600
when he became Christ there He developed,

42:14.120 --> 42:17.720
I don´t know how it worked out,

42:17.920 --> 42:27.760
but as Ganesha there is not at all forgiveness.

42:28.920 --> 42:32.080
Don´t try to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha,

42:32.280 --> 42:35.040
He´ll never forgive,

42:35.240 --> 42:37.840
even if his mother says “now you´d better forgive”,

42:38.040 --> 42:41.240
“No, that I´ll not do”.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.560
He never forgives!!

42:45.760 --> 42:49.600
Then only it comes to the point that the Mother has to say

42:49.800 --> 42:52.720
“I forgive you”, then He can do it,

42:52.920 --> 42:54.640
because one thing about Him is,

42:54.840 --> 42:59.040
He´s extremely obedient to his Mother, absolutely,

42:59.240 --> 43:01.400
so if the Mother has forgiven, finished.

43:01.600 --> 43:06.200
But otherwise, he will never, never forgive,

43:06.400 --> 43:13.920
and that´s why all kinds of these horrible diseases are here.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.920
Thousands of them.

43:18.120 --> 43:24.960
Also if you don´t respect Him then impotency can come

43:25.160 --> 43:32.400
or AIDS and all these secret diseases that people have.

43:34.520 --> 43:40.640
I had a very bad time with people who suffered

43:40.840 --> 43:43.440
from these secret diseases,

43:43.640 --> 43:49.920
because Shri Ganesha accepts my forgiveness

43:50.200 --> 43:54.200
but whenever he has a chance, again He comes back!

43:54.400 --> 44:00.640
Now see, they are deities with their own dharma.

44:01.120 --> 44:04.560
They too have their own dharma.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.960
He gives you a lot of things, he gives you

44:08.200 --> 44:12.320
mainly wisdom, discretion, understanding,

44:12.520 --> 44:16.960
but if you don´t obey Him, his qualities,

44:17.160 --> 44:21.520
then he´s a very difficult man.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.880
So to tell somebody “Don´t do it” is very difficult,

44:27.080 --> 44:30.600
but the nature takes respite.

44:34.120 --> 44:40.640
If you want to become patient it´s not difficult;

44:41.240 --> 44:44.920
but to get you cured on the Mooladhara

44:45.120 --> 44:48.320
is very, very difficult.

44:48.560 --> 44:53.240
You do get cured no doubt, ultimately,

44:53.440 --> 45:00.360
but the most difficult disease is from Mooladhara.

45:00.840 --> 45:04.720
He´s a child, alright,

45:05.440 --> 45:11.000
He´s an eternal child, He´s innocence,

45:11.640 --> 45:17.720
despite all that He cannot forgive you

45:17.920 --> 45:22.040
if you disturb your innocence.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.320
Mother is just the opposite,

45:26.520 --> 45:30.400
she wants to save at any cost, she wants to save people.

45:31.320 --> 45:34.080
But not Ganesha,

45:34.280 --> 45:38.160
Ganesha says “alright,

45:40.960 --> 45:44.680
you better go to hell”

45:44.880 --> 45:47.840
and hell is in our own lives here, you see,

45:48.040 --> 45:51.080
those people who like drinking, smoking,

45:51.280 --> 45:54.160
prostitution all this – this is all hell.

45:54.360 --> 45:57.440
What else is hell?

45:57.800 --> 46:05.080
And he will never save you from hell.

46:11.880 --> 46:17.320
Only in your Aarti, in Marathi, of Shri Ganesha,

46:17.520 --> 46:20.360
they say that at the time

46:20.560 --> 46:24.800
when I am getting my realization

46:25.000 --> 46:29.080
you must save me.

46:29.280 --> 46:32.600
That´s the only thing they ask,

46:32.800 --> 46:39.000
at the time of my resurrection you must save me.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.320
It does not say that

46:41.520 --> 46:45.520
at the time of my resurrection you protect me, no!

46:45.720 --> 46:48.360
You save me.

46:49.720 --> 46:56.080
Because he´s the one who is sitting on every chakra

46:56.280 --> 47:00.880
like a vice-chancellor of the university.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.720
Even if you have Vishnu on your side,

47:05.920 --> 47:08.440
Mahadeva on your side,

47:08.640 --> 47:12.440
but if Shri Ganesha is there sitting

47:12.640 --> 47:17.200
and He says “no, not his ascent”,

47:17.400 --> 47:22.720
it doesn´t work out, it´s very difficult.

47:23.160 --> 47:28.320
So now I am telling you this that your children are here.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.560
In these modern times

47:30.760 --> 47:34.560
horrible things are happening to children.

47:34.760 --> 47:40.560
I mean, I think the whole of this negativity is against the innocence.

47:40.760 --> 47:44.160
Wherever they get the children they misuse them,

47:44.360 --> 47:46.320
they teach them bad things.

47:46.520 --> 47:51.320
Even the schools everything is so horrid.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.680
So then we have to be careful.

47:54.880 --> 47:59.920
We have to be very very careful about our children.

48:00.120 --> 48:02.760
We have to guide them properly, look after them,

48:02.960 --> 48:09.360
and let their primordial taboos should be that,

48:09.560 --> 48:20.400
that restriction, that taboo, that is to be preserved.

48:20.760 --> 48:25.880
So if a child does something nice, appreciate it.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.400
I´m not worried about a child

48:28.600 --> 48:31.000
being little bit, what you can call,

48:31.200 --> 48:36.880
being a little bit mischievous, here they have to be.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.480
It´s alright.

48:38.680 --> 48:46.640
But if he takes to anything that is anti Ganesha, be careful!

48:48.200 --> 48:52.440
All kinds of diseases can develop,

48:52.920 --> 48:57.800
and if they are destroyed in childhood, these taboos,

48:57.960 --> 49:00.960
then they are very difficult to revive.

49:01.200 --> 49:05.360
Still I have always said that innocence is never lost,

49:05.560 --> 49:08.880
only there are some clouds

49:09.080 --> 49:13.080
which try to cover innocence

49:13.280 --> 49:18.600
and we become rather ignorant about it,

49:19.160 --> 49:23.480
that we have done anything wrong.

49:24.200 --> 49:27.440
That is your duty.

49:28.240 --> 49:31.480
Your society is horrible.

49:31.680 --> 49:35.280
Next generation I don´t know where it is going to end up.

49:35.480 --> 49:39.240
When I think about it I really get a fright.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.160
The solution is that you have to be

49:48.320 --> 49:53.720
careful about your children and their thinking

49:53.920 --> 50:01.200
and their attitude towards Shri Ganesha.

50:01.440 --> 50:08.160
They are special lovable things for Shri Ganesha.

50:08.360 --> 50:12.640
You can´t imagine how he loves the children

50:12.840 --> 50:17.520
and he´s always there to protect your children,

50:17.720 --> 50:22.320
if he protects anything it is the children he protects,

50:22.560 --> 50:29.160
and if you people really understand what I am saying now,

50:29.320 --> 50:36.560
because if you have to cross this margin

50:36.720 --> 50:41.360
of human life and spiritual life,

50:41.560 --> 50:46.280
first thing is your Shri Ganesh!

50:48.840 --> 50:53.640
When Kundalini rises Shri Ganesh is quiet,

50:53.840 --> 50:58.360
he just supports the Kundalini to rise.

51:00.120 --> 51:04.440
He´s the one who also suggests to you

51:04.640 --> 51:08.840
that it´s the wrong way you are doing things.

51:11.400 --> 51:17.520
He looks after you, but he´ll not forgive you.

51:17.720 --> 51:22.120
It is not so difficult.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.720
The way people talk

51:24.960 --> 51:28.560
about their physical needs and all this nonsense,

51:28.760 --> 51:33.040
even the animals don't talk like that.

51:33.240 --> 51:39.280
Try to enjoy things which will give you real enjoyment.

51:39.480 --> 51:45.640
For example flowers, nature, garden.

51:45.840 --> 51:49.480
Instead of destroying this nature, try to build it up,

51:49.680 --> 51:54.840
try to see how you can make it a beautiful garden,

51:55.040 --> 51:59.880
or a beautiful place.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.600
Every time I am here

52:02.800 --> 52:06.960
I am thinking what should I do with this land here

52:07.160 --> 52:12.160
which is very barren, how can I change it.

52:12.360 --> 52:15.520
All the time there is thought

52:15.720 --> 52:21.760
about how to make it beautiful,

52:24.960 --> 52:28.720
and in that, if there is innocence,

52:28.960 --> 52:30.760
no greed,

52:30.960 --> 52:34.520
there is no competition,

52:34.720 --> 52:36.600
there is no attachment,

52:36.800 --> 52:39.760
but just to enjoy the beauty

52:39.960 --> 52:45.520
of your own creation, to see how things are.

52:48.080 --> 52:51.120
Out of proportion people have gone,

52:51.320 --> 52:54.360
out of understanding.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.920
For example, here or anywhere else in Europe

52:58.120 --> 53:03.000
you are not supposed to grow anymore fruits.

53:03.200 --> 53:06.480
Why? Because the price must be kept low.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.440
If you have so many fruits

53:08.640 --> 53:14.960
why don´t you send it to places where they don´t have fruits?

53:15.400 --> 53:20.880
They will destroy it, finish it, but they will not do that.

53:21.880 --> 53:30.920
So the love and feeling for others is not there,

53:31.600 --> 53:37.560
and they destroy if something is overproduced by the Mother Earth

53:37.760 --> 53:41.360
just to keep the prices high.

53:41.560 --> 53:44.360
Very cruel!

53:44.560 --> 53:47.440
They are very cruel still.

53:47.640 --> 53:52.760
Only thinking about money, money, money, money.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.760
All this happens.

53:56.640 --> 54:01.760
So it´s still happening

54:01.960 --> 54:07.960
and I´m sure one day will come when it will all stop.

54:10.800 --> 54:18.480
The pubs are the best buildings in the village.

54:19.080 --> 54:26.240
Then the way they glorify drinking

54:26.440 --> 54:29.440
is the best part of it.

54:29.640 --> 54:34.480
It´s all done, you see it.

54:34.920 --> 54:38.760
Now only thing I would like you to have a desire

54:38.960 --> 54:44.400
that let drinking be finished, like smoking.

54:44.840 --> 54:50.760
If you think like that might solve a little bit.

54:50.960 --> 54:52.880
I personally think

54:53.080 --> 55:01.000
it is with drinking you develop all these perverted attitudes.

55:01.360 --> 55:06.840
Otherwise if it´s a normal man with a normal brain

55:07.040 --> 55:10.240
why should he do such things?

55:10.440 --> 55:15.120
Fighting, quarrelling, killing, violence.

55:16.600 --> 55:20.120
It´s impossible to understand

55:20.320 --> 55:24.880
how can a normal person do such a thing.

55:25.080 --> 55:28.120
Shri Ganesha gives you balance,

55:28.320 --> 55:32.720
he keeps you on the proper track.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.600
But if you don´t want to listen to him,

55:35.800 --> 55:38.600
you are thrown away.

55:45.120 --> 55:51.080
I hope you understand our relationship with nature,

55:51.280 --> 55:53.240
with Shri Ganesha

55:53.440 --> 56:00.200
and with our Kundalini is like,

56:00.400 --> 56:08.520
absolutely identified with each other, absolutely.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.240
If you start loving the nature

56:12.440 --> 56:18.560
all these ideas of spoiling your innocence will be finished.

56:20.480 --> 56:24.240
I used to write poetry, I´m very fond of nature,

56:24.440 --> 56:29.320
but then I told myself you have to do work for Sahaja Yoga.

56:29.520 --> 56:33.320
If you take to poetry they´ll all call you a poetess

56:33.520 --> 56:36.520
and I don´t want to have any such position

56:36.720 --> 56:39.680
to be a poetess and all that, I gave it up.

56:39.880 --> 56:42.240
And I was a very good sportswoman.

56:42.440 --> 56:47.200
I used to play things, I used to be first in every sort of game

56:47.400 --> 56:51.360
and I had championship, this and that. I gave it up.

56:51.560 --> 56:54.680
Whatever I did I used to get into it,

56:54.880 --> 56:56.520
I studied medicine

56:56.720 --> 57:01.200
I stood in the first at the whole university. I gave it up.

57:02.160 --> 57:09.200
Why? Because I´m the Primordial Mother,

57:09.400 --> 57:13.160
and I have to do the job

57:13.360 --> 57:18.120
of awakening the primordial nature,

57:18.320 --> 57:20.680
the dharma within human beings,

57:20.880 --> 57:24.240
and that´s what I have to do

57:25.240 --> 57:28.160
and nothing else.

57:28.360 --> 57:31.200
But for that I don´t do anything I am “Nishkriya”

57:31.400 --> 57:34.080
I don´t do anything, really I don´t do.

57:34.280 --> 57:36.280
It is done by the nature.

57:36.480 --> 57:38.040
Done by Shri Ganesha.

57:38.240 --> 57:41.920
Vishnu, Mahesha, everybody, they are doing it.

57:42.120 --> 57:48.920
But, then what is the relationship?

57:51.000 --> 57:56.480
The relationship is, they are all in my body

57:56.680 --> 58:00.680
and they are all bound by their own dharma,

58:00.880 --> 58:02.880
and they act.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.800
This is the relationship,

58:04.960 --> 58:09.760
spontaneous, automatic, like a built-in relationship.

58:09.960 --> 58:12.120
For example, the fan is built in

58:12.320 --> 58:16.040
so as soon as you push the button it starts moving.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.560
It´s like that.

58:18.760 --> 58:22.120
All of them are related to me,

58:22.320 --> 58:26.240
and they have a tremendous protocol,

58:26.440 --> 58:28.680
tremendous respect,

58:28.880 --> 58:36.680
that if I say anything they will not finish it.

58:36.880 --> 58:39.320
You see this thing is that

58:39.520 --> 58:45.840
very very deep thing that I am telling you,

58:46.040 --> 58:51.040
that you are a human being,

58:51.240 --> 58:53.640
that there is built in.

58:53.840 --> 58:57.920
Within you are your dharmas

58:58.120 --> 59:01.840
and if you go against your dharmas

59:02.040 --> 59:05.720
then you´ll be finished.

59:05.920 --> 59:09.360
They´re all built in within you,

59:09.560 --> 59:15.440
they are all there, potentially.

59:15.640 --> 59:21.600
I hope you´ll understand how important it is

59:21.800 --> 59:28.440
to be aware of your restrictions within yourself.

59:29.280 --> 59:32.080
So thank you very much all of you.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.000
May God bless you!!
