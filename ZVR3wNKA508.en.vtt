00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.300
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.920
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.340
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.320
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.480
However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:00.600
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:25.700
and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:40.460
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.220
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.360
A small boy who came into the world and did such great work!

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:05.000
He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:23.100
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:47.940
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:58.760
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything, but you cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:08.900
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is. Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:19.540
When He is awakened within us, then we have no questions left.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.700
Then we are successful, in whichever task
we undertake.We find joy in everything we do.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:40.000
He is the embodiment of joy and gives joy to everyone.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.540
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.240
This pleases Him very much.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:13.180
Such an embodiment of love, such a pure-hearted

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.100
Shri Ganesha was born today.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.480
This is the importance of this day.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.660
Today if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:45.380
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.300
Ask Him with all your heart and He will help you

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.480
in every way, every moment, every instant.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.380
Today is a very big day,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.040
because the actual
pure spirit has taken birth today.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:28.160
And He already had such an eternal state,
that many people could not comprehend it

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.240
or write about it.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.760
They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.700
that by the power of Shri Ganesha’s name
you can get your realization.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:53.000
By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.420
He is eternal.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:11.180
He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.440
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him.

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:27.860
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:44.800
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings you can
do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will you have any problems.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:53.120
Because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.700
Though He is a little boy, He looks after
you.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.840
Shri Ganesha is a very great power by which so much work is getting done.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.300
For Me, He is the purest and My own.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:23.840
I trouble Him a lot, when somebody tries to trouble Me, I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him all right.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:35.640
When this fellow is unmanageable for Me, when
there is a difficult person and it is possible

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:42.860
for Me to handle him, then He does the job.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:52.000
So today’s day is very auspicious as today
He is born.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.920
Secondly today is Panchami (the Fifth Day).

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:12.480
This Panchami is recognized because on this day we wear a dress,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:21.960
whatever we wear today is so that our body is properly covered.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:39.640
The sense of shame and chastity that our body
has is because of Him.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.120
Lajja Rupena Samstitha.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:54.220
So if you have any sense of chastity and shame, it is because of Him.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.740
That will benefit you immensely.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:08.760
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.040
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.380
you become joyous, because He is the personification.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:31.260
Because of this, both things are today, His
birthday and His help.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:42.560
We take His help in any work what we do.
Such is our way. In that direction our attention does not go.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:52.600
But we don't see what we have to do to awaken Him.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.480
We do not feel that we should become like
Him, that we should have a state in which

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:07.200
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.320
With which we may never venture on the wrong path.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:18.720
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:27.620
they despise all the wrong things in this
world and they do not do anything wrong

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.500
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.400
They cannot enjoy any wrong activities.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.180
This is Shri Ganesha's great blessing that
you have come into such a joyous life.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:11:02.120
So today in His service you sing His praise
and glory, so that He may be pleased.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.200
My Eternal Blessings to all of you.
