1
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,533
Now, we are starting a New Year,

2
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:20,616
and I wish you all a very happy and
prosperous New Year.

3
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:40,593
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very
deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

4
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:58,999
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all
have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:10,844
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am
sure you are doing meditation, introspection

6
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:18,566
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals,
I should say.

7
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:33,670
In this New Year, I’ll think there is
greater chance

8
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:39,607
for you to do much better,

9
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:48,114
because all those years of ordeals are
over.

10
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:02,983
We are now entering into the New Era. I say
now the Satya Yuga is established.

11
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:15,024
In the beginning you may not feel
the atmosphere

12
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:21,165
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

13
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:28,319
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all
clearing out

14
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:36,305
and all the people who are dangerous
for your spiritual life,

15
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:46,953
for your national life, for your family
life, will have to take back their way;

16
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:50,711
they cannot be successful here.

17
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:05,680
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far
they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

18
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:10,132
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

19
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:16,852
There should be many more waiting for you
this year,

20
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:23,852
and maybe this year, if you all decide to
work it out, I am sure

21
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:32,218
you can get lots of people who will be
saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

22
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:40,344
This is going to be your vow on the New
Year day,

23
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:47,696
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga
in a new way,

24
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:52,069
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

25
00:40:52,270 --> 00:41:00,173
For that, first thing is needed is your
Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

26
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:07,493
This collectivity has to be extremely well
built-in, well made,

27
00:41:07,694 --> 00:41:13,225
well understood and absolutely loveable.

28
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:20,805
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga,
because practically all your jealousies,

29
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:30,537
all your baser ideas have been completely
washed out by your Kundalini.

30
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:37,477
She has transformed you, you are different
people; you are very, very different.

31
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:46,265
Not only that, but you have now understood
yourselves.

32
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:52,305
You are knowing your Self. And all those
who know their self

33
00:41:52,506 --> 00:41:55,994
cannot fight with each other.

34
00:41:57,155 --> 00:42:05,155
Because this Self is the reflection of one
person,

35
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:13,390
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can
you fight?

36
00:42:13,591 --> 00:42:21,155
When He is within your heart, how can you
fight with each other?

37
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:25,133
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting
with yourself.

38
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,727
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

39
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:38,186
So all the fights and all the funny things
that you have been thinking about

40
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:44,272
will of course disappear, no doubt. But
you’ll become very dynamic.

41
00:42:44,473 --> 00:42:48,710
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you
have to rise;

42
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:54,780
just you have to expect your Self
to manifest.

43
00:42:54,981 --> 00:43:01,579
You can become very, very collective,
progressive

44
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,209
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

45
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:15,071
You have been given Realization; you have
been given the knowledge of Realization;

46
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:23,016
whatever was possible has been done
for your health and prosperity,

47
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:32,608
but now it’s your duty to repay to
the Divine by your creative methods.

48
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:36,194
You have to be very creative.

49
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:44,461
You'll find so many people in this world
are full of lots of problems,

50
00:43:44,662 --> 00:43:51,093
which you have got out of it. But you can
help them.

51
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:56,092
You don’t need any help because you are
yourself full of power –

52
00:43:56,293 --> 00:44:03,220
power of Divinity within you. This Divine
power should be used.

53
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:09,134
It’s not given just to be rusted. This
power has to be used.

54
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:13,385
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming
powerful?

55
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:18,417
Supposing we have electrical power here,
and it doesn’t even give light,

56
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:22,237
so what’s the use of having electrical
power?

57
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:28,330
So the power that you have is for
the emancipation of human beings.

58
00:44:30,787 --> 00:44:38,534
It is for you to raise the Kundalini
of people – you can do it.

59
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:41,721
One person can do it for thousands!

60
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:48,222
And I hope now you take up this
responsibility upon yourself.

61
00:44:48,423 --> 00:44:54,278
This would be the greatest blessing for
you, for Sahaja Yoga

62
00:44:54,479 --> 00:45:02,231
and for the whole world. Because in My
vision, we have to change the whole world.

63
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:06,176
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can
achieve it or not.

64
00:45:06,377 --> 00:45:09,964
But if you people really join hands with Me,

65
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:15,778
with full effort, it will work out.

66
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:25,270
Firstly I hear many people don’t go
to meditation, into collective meditation.

67
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:33,200
They do not join together. It’s surprising
after so many years of work I’ve done –

68
00:45:33,401 --> 00:45:38,958
thirty years I’ve been working, and there
are some, some people

69
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:45,917
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t
understand your responsibility.

70
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:50,395
You have to meditate collectively.

71
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:55,518
Whenever there is collective meditation
you must join that.

72
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:03,932
You can also start something in your areas,
a collective meditation.

73
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:10,182
And it will work out. Many people who are
in Sahaja Yoga

74
00:46:10,383 --> 00:46:14,018
are now meditating, I can make them out.

75
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:18,417
I know who are the ones who are meditating
and who are not.

76
00:46:18,618 --> 00:46:22,278
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then
you come out

77
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:27,833
with other problems like my mother’s,
father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

78
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:34,020
There’s no need to worry about that. Even
if you are a realized soul,

79
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:41,237
and when you are connected with the Divine,
even your own wish will be fulfilled.

80
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:49,520
But it does not. Why? Because you still do
not understand what you have become.

81
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:56,065
You first try giving Realizations to others.
See what joy you feel.

82
00:46:56,266 --> 00:47:01,536
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get
in anything else.

83
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:06,424
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may
have,

84
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:11,004
you cannot get this joy of giving
Realization.

85
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:16,676
And you will be so very happy; not because
you expect anything,

86
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:23,481
you want anything, nothing of the kind –
but only thing is pure joy –

87
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:31,253
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis.
This is what you are there.

88
00:47:31,454 --> 00:47:40,458
This is what the Divine wants you to do.
Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

89
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:45,520
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure
my sister… ”

90
00:47:45,721 --> 00:47:50,051
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then
somebody says,

91
00:47:50,252 --> 00:47:56,801
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife
says that… so the husband says this...

92
00:47:57,002 --> 00:48:00,222
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

93
00:48:00,423 --> 00:48:04,168
You are now above everything, above all
these things.

94
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:09,598
And you have become absolutely powerful,
believe Me.

95
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:15,206
If you haven’t used your power, then how
will you know what powers you have got?

96
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:20,083
It’s as simple as that. Those who have
used it

97
00:48:20,284 --> 00:48:25,200
go on telling Me what miracles they had,
what things have happened to them,

98
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:31,268
how they were protected, whatever they
wanted – how they got it.

99
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:38,364
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be
hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

100
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:41,753
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows
you are a hypocritical.

101
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:47,145
It is for your good, for your growth you
have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

102
00:48:47,346 --> 00:48:51,520
It’s not for somebody else that you are
doing it, but for yourself.

103
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:58,997
When people are that powerful I am
amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

104
00:48:59,198 --> 00:49:04,050
But they must meditate, and they must join
collective meditation.

105
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:08,729
Most of the people don’t join collective
meditation. I am surprised.

106
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:14,118
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is
no sufficient space,

107
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:19,166
so people have to come twice, either
Saturday or Sunday;

108
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:22,568
some of them have to wait outside –
doesn’t matter.

109
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:26,932
But going for the collective meditation,

110
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:33,330
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing
there. Vibrations are flowing there.

111
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:40,899
I am there. It’s not that you are just
going there just as a ritual.

112
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:49,094
Problem is you people don’t realize that you
have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

113
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:56,307
responsible for giving Realizations
to others and attend

114
00:49:56,508 --> 00:50:03,657
all the programs you have of meditation.

115
00:50:03,858 --> 00:50:08,198
With collective meditation you get
all right.

116
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:14,772
All your problems are solved if you go to
the collective meditation regularly –

117
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:21,409
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t
go; you will write letters to Me,

118
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:26,743
you want to meet Me. This is not going
to help.

119
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:31,987
You may come and trouble Me like that, or
do something like that, but doesn’t help.

120
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:41,930
What helps that you help yourself. Next
year is going to be a great year for you.

121
00:50:42,985 --> 00:50:48,992
In the West now I was surprised how things
are spreading fast.

122
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:58,618
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

123
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:05,962
Once they get Realization, they understand
the value of Realization.

124
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:11,744
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t
want anything.

125
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:17,291
They’ve never desired for anything. Though
they have gone through horrible

126
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:24,540
problems of communism, and now this
reaction to that.

127
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:33,627
Despite that, all these five countries
which I call as ‘real’

128
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:40,914
Divine countries, because the way they have
accepted it.

129
00:51:41,524 --> 00:51:45,266
They are poor according to the modern
standards,

130
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:50,242
but from their heart they are very,
very rich.

131
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:56,758
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,
they are very, very rich.

132
00:51:56,959 --> 00:52:03,290
And their scientists are so well qualified.
In every type of thing now,

133
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:10,744
there is one scientist who has come
to India and who has discovered a method

134
00:52:10,945 --> 00:52:16,088
by which you can see all the chakras, and
the Kundalini

135
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:22,174
and the obstructions and everything –
something he can show you.

136
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:30,190
While our scientists are busy opposing Me.
Little knowledge is very dangerous.

137
00:52:30,391 --> 00:52:34,118
They don’t want to see what I am doing and
how I am doing it.

138
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:40,416
They just want to criticize Me – all
so-called intellectuals.

139
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:42,790
Especially in Maharashtra,

140
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:47,252
the intellectuals – I think they are
something has gone wrong with their heads.

141
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:53,073
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just
beyond them.

142
00:52:53,274 --> 00:52:59,471
What has happened to them I don’t know,
but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

143
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:05,073
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with
their rituals.

144
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:09,079
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up,
take their baths, do this,

145
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,198
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

146
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:18,837
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes
to Me,

147
00:53:19,038 --> 00:53:22,399
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do
any rituals,

148
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,634
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

149
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:30,385
As if doing by that you mean you are
a Sahaja Yogi.

150
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:34,916
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing
can happen to you.

151
00:53:35,117 --> 00:53:39,010
But you have been just under wrong
impression.

152
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:44,441
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go
to wrong places

153
00:53:44,642 --> 00:53:51,785
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never
helped anyone.

154
00:53:51,986 --> 00:53:58,394
So first you have to empty yourself. If you
are already filled with these ideas,

155
00:53:58,595 --> 00:54:03,931
these age old ideas, and you are still
carrying on with them,

156
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:06,316
how can the Divine be filled?

157
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:12,785
If there’s a pot already full of water or
anything – you cannot fill it.

158
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:20,736
So you have to empty it completely. Empty
yourself, empty your mind.

159
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:29,324
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can
take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

160
00:54:29,525 --> 00:54:34,910
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst
thing,

161
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:40,933
because reaction comes through your Agnya,
as I told you the other day,

162
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:49,728
and it is due to your conditioning or due
to your ego.

163
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:54,785
So some people react because of their
conditioning,

164
00:54:54,986 --> 00:55:04,113
and some people react because of their ego.
So why should you react to anything?

165
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:09,019
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting.
You just watch.

166
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:16,253
See how beautifully they have made
beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

167
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:20,714
What is the need – some will find some
faults, somebody will say

168
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:23,853
this should not have been there, how did
they manage this,

169
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:31,456
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy
of its creation is there.

170
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:37,042
And you should be able to see it, feel it,
enjoy it.

171
00:55:37,243 --> 00:55:42,321
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise
you are not.

172
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:48,416
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be
a Sahaja Yogi.

173
00:55:48,617 --> 00:55:52,924
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

174
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:59,212
I think there are so many various styles
of Sahaja Yogis.

175
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:06,527
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little
plus, somebody’s like that.

176
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:12,439
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

177
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,324
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous
and happy.

178
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:23,527
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting
angry with others,

179
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:28,579
all these things are going on, and he
thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

180
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:36,370
In our Divine University we have no
degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

181
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:39,495
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got
your Realization.

182
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:45,462
If the Kundalini has burst opened here –
it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

183
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:52,195
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real
Sahaja Yogi.

184
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:58,993
It only depends when you are joyous and you
are anxious

185
00:56:59,194 --> 00:57:04,822
to give Realizations to others. You want
to share your Realization,

186
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:11,493
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself.
If that is not your condition,

187
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:15,679
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

188
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,905
You should find out how many people you
have given Realization.

189
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:26,134
It’s very important. Because next year, as
I’ve said, is a very important,

190
00:57:26,335 --> 00:57:31,664
very, very important year.

191
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:42,158
In that year I would like to see all of you
going round and giving Realization.

192
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:49,355
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus
who are getting exposed one by one.

193
00:57:50,215 --> 00:57:58,267
If you see their attitude, anywhere you
meet them – once I was travelling

194
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:02,702
by plane and there was a lady sitting next
to Me, she was so hot.

195
00:58:02,903 --> 00:58:07,079
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?”
So she told Me the name.

196
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,859
She said “He’s very good, this guru is
the best” … this and that.

197
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:16,423
Such heat coming from her body! I never
said anything,

198
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:23,267
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly
talking about her guru

199
00:58:23,468 --> 00:58:31,275
who is such a bad man – and without knowing
Me, I was just a stranger to her.

200
00:58:31,476 --> 00:58:35,468
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

201
00:58:35,669 --> 00:58:41,702
You should talk to your neighbors, you
should talk in your circle.

202
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:51,126
Like, we have in India so many customs when
we meet people:

203
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:55,312
Like in India we do haldi kumkum
in Maharashtra.

204
00:58:55,513 --> 00:59:00,313
They will never talk to those women who
come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:59:00,514 --> 00:59:04,210
They won’t even have My photograph.

206
00:59:04,772 --> 00:59:07,593
If they want, they can do it. But they
are -

207
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:12,469
I don’t know what are they frightened
about. It’s a very good chance.

208
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:18,751
You have any dinner, you have any public
meeting, anything.

209
00:59:18,952 --> 00:59:23,054
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very surprising.

210
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:25,194
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

211
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,649
that, “We have got this through Sahaja
Yoga.”

212
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:33,376
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

213
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:40,790
One has to understand you all should find
out how much responsible you have been

214
00:59:40,991 --> 00:59:45,962
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course,
you are all protected,

215
00:59:46,163 --> 00:59:55,719
you are all blessed, everyone has got
whatever they wanted. Most of them.

216
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,265
But how many of them are returning
this debt?

217
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:07,969
How many are working to give Realization
to others?

218
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:17,626
This is a debt on you. But if your
attention is haphazard,

219
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:26,491
if your attention is not clear, is not
nirmal,

220
01:00:26,692 --> 01:00:36,946
then you are involved into all kinds
of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

221
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:39,679
You become like an octopus,

222
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,743
you go on getting attached to this,
attached to that, attached to that.

223
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:53,194
You have to be a free bird. All these
attachments that you have

224
01:00:54,514 --> 01:01:01,884
are going to take you nowhere. You should
be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

225
01:01:02,085 --> 01:01:07,632
and should be conscious that you have known
yourself.

226
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:14,579
If you can just understand your value,
your level,

227
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:19,944
I can tell you – we can change the whole
world!

228
01:01:20,145 --> 01:01:23,716
We have such a good heritage in this
country;

229
01:01:23,908 --> 01:01:27,624
we have such good culture in this country.

230
01:01:27,825 --> 01:01:33,803
I have seen the problems of America and
other places, we don’t have these problems.

231
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:38,981
At least they’re not so prevalent.

232
01:01:39,182 --> 01:01:44,099
But only the thing that we have to do

233
01:01:44,754 --> 01:01:48,694
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

234
01:01:48,895 --> 01:01:54,475
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows
it’s a tree.

235
01:01:54,676 --> 01:02:00,686
It knows it has to produce roots, it has
not come up ‘like that’.

236
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:07,499
It has not been brought up just like
a stick, no.

237
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:14,975
It has to do something. In this world
everything has to do something.

238
01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:19,669
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such
a rare thing to happen

239
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:25,178
that you have got your Realization. So
where should we waste our attention?

240
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:32,444
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why?
We have to grow, we are a different people.

241
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:38,505
We are a different race altogether in this
world. We are realized souls.

242
01:02:38,706 --> 01:02:45,045
There were hardly any number during
the time of Christ, practically nil.

243
01:02:45,246 --> 01:02:51,325
And even before that I was surprised that
in China and other places,

244
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:59,309
in one age there used to be one guru – one
master. While you are so many masters,

245
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:04,255
but you don’t want to use your power
as a master.

246
01:03:04,456 --> 01:03:09,280
Why not the women use it also? I find women
are more lethargic

247
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:14,121
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should
show – I am a woman Myself,

248
01:03:14,322 --> 01:03:18,536
single-handed I’ve done all this work;
and why shouldn’t you do it?

249
01:03:18,737 --> 01:03:24,749
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform
people all over the world.

250
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:31,389
But it’s very easy for you – if I can
do it, why can’t you do it?

251
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:40,116
But put your complete attention to it that:
‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

252
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:44,397
not for ourselves, but for the betterment
of humanity.’

253
01:03:44,598 --> 01:03:49,474
We need it, we need it very much.

254
01:03:49,675 --> 01:03:55,967
Your compassion, your love, is all being
wasted

255
01:03:56,168 --> 01:04:02,036
if you just think about yourself,
your family – what’s the use?

256
01:04:02,518 --> 01:04:06,116
People do that even before Realization.

257
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:12,833
So what is the use of completely getting
attached to your families,

258
01:04:13,034 --> 01:04:18,888
attached to all other things? You should
get attached to the whole world!

259
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:24,669
You belong to the whole world now, you are
no more individualistic.

260
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:31,210
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop
has become the ocean.

261
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:38,686
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is
the lowest, if you have seen,

262
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:44,786
lowest so much that the zero point starts
from the ocean.

263
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:51,186
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point –
it lives,

264
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:55,036
but all the rivers flow into it.

265
01:04:55,237 --> 01:05:02,280
And the ocean does the work of throwing
clouds in the sky.

266
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:10,528
And these then burst and become rain
falling to the same ocean.

267
01:05:10,729 --> 01:05:16,893
They come back to the same ocean. So those
who are humble

268
01:05:17,094 --> 01:05:20,723
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

269
01:05:20,924 --> 01:05:25,739
Those who are kind will attract much more
Sahaja Yogis.

270
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:31,090
So it is important to see that you change
your temperament.

271
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:37,081
If you try to show off, nobody is going
to be impressed by you.

272
01:05:39,112 --> 01:05:46,176
If you think you are something very great,
nobody is going to look at you.

273
01:05:46,377 --> 01:05:56,121
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very
joyous person.

274
01:05:56,322 --> 01:06:00,753
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group
and telling them,

275
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:07,667
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying
and this thing is happening,

276
01:06:07,868 --> 01:06:15,653
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will
say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

277
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:19,895
You go and cry and weep and sit down
there!”

278
01:06:20,096 --> 01:06:27,942
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no
sickness can come, no trouble can come.

279
01:06:28,143 --> 01:06:33,401
It is a fact. Try to understand.

280
01:06:33,602 --> 01:06:40,403
With you only these people who are
supposed to be there, they will rise.

281
01:06:40,604 --> 01:06:46,714
But no use having identification with
people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

282
01:06:46,915 --> 01:06:50,276
They may be your relations, they may be
anything. No use,

283
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:54,073
because you are at a different level, they
are at a different level.

284
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:59,590
Either try to raise their level, or have
nothing to do with them,

285
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:05,246
because they will pull you down. They will
not see your height,

286
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:11,581
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear
to hear,

287
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:18,246
and they have no feelings of any kind.
If they have seen how you are changed,

288
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:25,980
how your life is changed, they would have
gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

289
01:07:26,181 --> 01:07:31,825
But if they are not, that’s not your job.
You shouldn’t bother about them.

290
01:07:32,026 --> 01:07:36,395
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good,
otherwise they are no your relations.

291
01:07:36,596 --> 01:07:41,244
In no way they are related to you. How will
you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

292
01:07:41,445 --> 01:07:45,425
How will you explain anything to them?
It’s going to be impossible

293
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:48,463
to talk to these people.

294
01:07:50,494 --> 01:07:55,356
So what I have to tell you today is that
our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

295
01:07:55,557 --> 01:08:02,465
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and
it’s doing very well.

296
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:07,339
But what we have to see – that you do
belong to that ocean,

297
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,684
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

298
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:17,963
But it is for you to increase the size
of this.

299
01:08:18,174 --> 01:08:23,942
You have to increase, you have to talk
about it, and you have to change people.

300
01:08:24,143 --> 01:08:33,246
This is your responsibility. You were not
given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

301
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:39,637
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis,
better Sahaja Yogis;

302
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,823
and you yourself meditate, not only
meditate

303
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:50,903
but also attend all the collective programs
as far as possible.

304
01:08:51,104 --> 01:08:56,385
I am happy the way you have stayed on and
have come here.

305
01:08:56,586 --> 01:09:05,371
It has rained – still you are here and you
still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

306
01:09:05,572 --> 01:09:11,448
I again and again bless you from my heart,
and I want you to have

307
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:16,762
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

308
01:09:16,963 --> 01:09:25,004
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is
the pure desire,

309
01:09:25,205 --> 01:09:31,356
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but
to create more Sahaja Yogis.

310
01:09:31,557 --> 01:09:37,455
That is actually your pure desire. You may
not have recognized it,

311
01:09:37,656 --> 01:09:43,465
but unless and until you fulfill that
desire,

312
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:48,252
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi.
It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

313
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:56,143
in every level, in everywhere, with every
one – that you can do it.

314
01:09:56,344 --> 01:10:01,653
And it will spread very well, and so many
people can be saved.

315
01:10:01,854 --> 01:10:08,012
So many people who are just lost
in the maya of stupidity

316
01:10:08,213 --> 01:10:11,112
will be back on the right path.

317
01:10:11,313 --> 01:10:15,887
How much good you are going to do for them
you just think.

318
01:10:16,088 --> 01:10:20,369
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja
Yogis,

319
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:27,840
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja
Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

320
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:31,731
The whole problem – whenever I see
newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

321
01:10:31,932 --> 01:10:35,887
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there
would have been no problem’.

322
01:10:36,088 --> 01:10:41,885
But I find that still people are roaming
about, and going round and round,

323
01:10:42,086 --> 01:10:47,690
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or
they’ve no understanding

324
01:10:47,898 --> 01:10:53,970
that ‘where is this world going?’ and
‘Who’s going to save this world?’

325
01:10:54,854 --> 01:11:00,979
I am not here to tell you what you should
do in your private life.

326
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:05,297
But you yourself should know to keep
yourself cleansed

327
01:11:05,498 --> 01:11:09,016
and beautiful, what you have to do
to yourself.

328
01:11:09,217 --> 01:11:13,674
Some people are so superficial that it
doesn’t go into their heads.

329
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:17,268
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their
heads – very, very superficial.

330
01:11:17,469 --> 01:11:22,580
So forget them. I don’t think they can
be saved. So forget them,

331
01:11:22,781 --> 01:11:27,153
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about
some nonsensical things always.

332
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:32,338
So with such people you need not – but
there are still so many people,

333
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:39,738
at least I think 80% people, who are
seeking and you should give them help.

334
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:43,349
This is one thing, is the desire of your
Mother

335
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,296
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga
upon yourself

336
01:11:47,497 --> 01:11:51,380
and go on telling about this to everyone
who comes.

337
01:11:51,581 --> 01:12:00,541
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I
do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.
