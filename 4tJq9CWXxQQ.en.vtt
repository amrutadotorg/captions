00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:18.719
its,

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:20.878
awakening of religion

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:24.823
which we know as Kundalini

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.030
With any practice,

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:30.961
with any effort,

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.141
with money,

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:38.744
hard work,

00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:40.922
influence

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.982
will not happen due to

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:46.621
any external reasons.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.786
In every religion

00:00:57.228 --> 00:00:58.404
their own, individual

00:00:58.667 --> 00:00:59.674
separate separate

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:02.049
modes

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.471
for
Kundalini awakening.

00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:08.088
have been created

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:12.760
Like the 'Namaz' of Muslims,

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:15.342
is Kundalini awakening,

00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:17.030
 a process in its entirety.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:21.390
Completely, putting hands like this,

00:01:21.872 --> 00:01:23.055
bending down,

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:26.703
then stand on your head,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.703
holding the ear,

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:30.241
putting fingers in ears,
etc.;

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:31.291
 Everything is a

00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:33.261
Kundalini awakening

00:01:33.488 --> 00:01:34.494
system only.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:37.121
But everything is mechanical,

00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:38.860
It is artificial.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.327
As, in any

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:53.038
parts making

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:56.024
Can't be done without energy,

00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.434
In the same way that inside us

00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:03.745
dormant

00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:05.525
consciousness,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:08.281
that we know as Kundalini

00:02:08.948 --> 00:02:10.695
also cannot be awakened

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.258
by any human effort or by

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:16.970
any artificial measure.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.110
Similarly,

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:21.422
In the Christians

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.335
the prayer, that they have

00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:25.319
In this also

00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:27.403
Kundalini awakening
provision is there in too.

00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:33.850
from the very beginning when the child is
Given initiation, it is called Bakshai.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.875
Before Jesus Christ,

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:45.838
When people were given
initiation Of the religion, they

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:49.995
Used to drown in the river
itself, and you just know that

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:52.340
even after realization when
you go into the river how

00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:54.550
much comfort do you
people get from this?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.580
But those, drowning them, were no real
souls.

00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:05.326
There were no truely advanced
people to tell them about religion.

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:07.697
They also do all
such artificial work,

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:10.224
Brought some, dipped
some, kept them,

00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:12.874
They thought that
they accomplished very big task,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.921
He did the religious
work and gave initiation.

00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:23.665
Among them also

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.540
the Kamilion Christians, in particular,

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.694
In which that wine,
although it is not wine,

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.116
It must be grape juice,
that was converted into wine.

00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:45.934
And bread, two things that they
give to everyone, so that you can eat,

00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:48.201
You know that we also

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.610
to open the navel chakra we give you
water and advise to eat something.

00:03:57.663 --> 00:03:59.920
This is also a system
to open the navel chakra.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.019
And in our Hindu religion

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:11.839
For centuries, all the substitutes
for Kundalini Jagurti were devised,

00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:15.420
But the most beautiful
form of that in Krishna's

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:18.861
incarnation only could be seen.

00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:24.153
Krishna's stealing butter

00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:29.295
And tieing everyone with Him,

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:34.673
He only meant was that from
His navel chakra if

00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:37.987
everyone get tied, He will also
clean up everyone's navel chakra.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.944
Radha ji's going to
Jamna and filling water,

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:46.530
just meant that the water
of Jamna Ji should get vibrated.

00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:50.371
And when They put up
'Gagar' a pitcher on their

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:53.802
head, then Krishna ji
will hit them from behind.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.648
So the water that falls from their backs,
So again the water gets vibrated double

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.756
and goes down the
Kundilini and to the ground,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.678
then the whole
earth will get vibrated.

00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:08.984
What a perfect plan
had been set;

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:13.188
This was Radha ji's trait only,
none the else could do it.

00:05:14.888 --> 00:05:18.493
And that of the Gopis

00:05:20.496 --> 00:05:24.634
going to Panghat, it is of
immense importance for us.

00:05:25.373 --> 00:05:27.708
What is there in the
incarnation of Lord Krishna?

00:05:27.732 --> 00:05:29.921
Why did the Gopis
do all these numerous tasks?

00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:33.671
And their bringing water from Panghat
was also considered very special.

00:05:35.388 --> 00:05:37.960
Its symbol is that
Radha ji used to sit

00:05:37.984 --> 00:05:41.099
putting her legs crossed
in the Jamna water,

00:05:42.356 --> 00:05:47.290
and due to this, the water
there would get vibrated, and

00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:50.810
the gopis would take
it in pitcherfuls to their homes

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:53.610
so that their navel
chakras etc. would open.

00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:58.283
Raas Leela was also nothing
else, it was Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:02.788
You've seen me sometimes say; I
want everyone to sit holding hands.

00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:11.495
This is not a matter
of restlessness, our

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.028
In Sahaja Yoga! many people
become very restless,

00:06:14.402 --> 00:06:16.502
and start doing something
even, out of restlessness;

00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:19.969
This is not a matter
of concern at all.

00:06:21.593 --> 00:06:25.085
You must perform
each action very

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:29.697
carefully. must
understand what it means

00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:35.003
And by doing this you are
giving rest to the navel chakra.

00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:42.801
All the chakras in our body,

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:47.623
in all those chakras

00:06:50.964 --> 00:06:55.740
Our powers are implicit.

00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:01.919
And when we use them

00:07:02.992 --> 00:07:07.556
those chakras become dimnished,
these inherent powers go away.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.246
There is only one such nadi, Sushmana
Nadi, that the power within which

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:19.875
gets stretched becomes
Kundilini and we can't use it.

00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:24.032
And in that Nadi system, the respective

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:33.466
Ishta Dev, Ishta Devis

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.433
sitting on each Chakra

00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:42.273
Which, when we
from our chakras

00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:50.030
spend that energy

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.950
And if we consume it then a situation comes

00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:58.254
where The power
of God is completely

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:02.666
exhausted, and then

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.078
the Gods there become

00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:10.811
silent, sleep, become
extinct or become annoyed.

00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:19.037
In such a situation, there then cancer
like ailments, such diseases commense.

00:08:20.995 --> 00:08:25.484
To put any chakra to good use

00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:31.553
These Chakras, the surrounding
space around them, it is

00:08:35.726 --> 00:08:38.442
nurtured by its own Chakra power;

00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:42.792
All these calves of the body

00:08:46.682 --> 00:08:48.682
they suffer from this.

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:54.247
But we have to use this power,

00:08:55.037 --> 00:08:58.880
And that power has to
be used in every situation.

00:09:01.554 --> 00:09:07.622
Therefore in matters like
religion when we start using it

00:09:07.912 --> 00:09:11.609
So the power of our religion
also ends up and gets spent.

00:09:12.092 --> 00:09:16.819
Similarly, our powers get
exhausted due to usage of any chakra;

00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:20.226
Like chanting a mantra,

00:09:24.216 --> 00:09:28.984
By chanting the mantra,
such as this vocal system, Which

00:09:29.008 --> 00:09:33.581
we should say that the
sound comes from there,

00:09:34.271 --> 00:09:36.348
and used for a long time

00:09:37.022 --> 00:09:43.985
When we keep reciting the mantra

00:09:44.925 --> 00:09:49.347
So our power here
becomes very weak,

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.189
and you will be surprised

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:57.939
That this place of Krishna,
which we call Vishuddhi,

00:09:59.496 --> 00:10:02.397
And those who chant the name
of Radha Krishna from morning till night

00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:04.922
They keep on cramming
, their this Chakra is effected.

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:11.146
it's a big surprise

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.521
That you recite the name of Radha Krishna
and your Vishuddhi Chakra gets bad.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.377
A lot of people

00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:22.254
Keep chanting the
name of Lord Shiva,

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:26.953
And till now, I have never
seen anything like this.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.603
Those who worshiped Lord
Shiva before realization You

00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:31.936
take names and that their
heart Chakra is not caught.

00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:36.866
This shows that the heart Chakra, but
if name of Lord Shiva is taken then

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.950
In this way your
Vishuddhi The chakra will

00:10:39.974 --> 00:10:43.096
also be effected and
so will your heart chakra.

00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:51.825
Similarly, we keep making
all kinds of mistakes.

00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:57.769
Because otherwise someone
imposes something (unclear)

00:10:57.926 --> 00:11:56.283
AUDIO SYSTEM FAILURE

00:11:56.607 --> 00:11:59.176
And our powers are pulling,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.430
And sometimes it
pulls so hard that

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:37.465
AUDIO SYSTEM FAILURE

00:12:37.922 --> 00:12:41.621
And which door did you close?
and when the door opens from behind

00:12:41.945 --> 00:13:45.293
AUDIO SYSTEM FAILURE

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.918
Same is the condition of all
efforts like Pranayama etc.

00:13:49.842 --> 00:13:52.089
People who do hatha yoga,

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:54.123
Or those who say that
we are doing Hatha Yoga;

00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:56.479
Not everyone can do Hatha Yoga.

00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:01.296
Because Hatha Yoga means
two nerves âHaâ and âThâ.

00:14:01.936 --> 00:14:05.250
There is âHaâ nadi
which we call Ida nadi,

00:14:05.924 --> 00:14:07.603
Those people do ALL about it?

00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:10.636
they do, whatever efforts
we have to on the entire Nadi.

00:14:10.753 --> 00:14:13.595
But it is very difficult
to get down to 'Tha' nadi.

00:14:15.335 --> 00:14:17.016
The 'Tha' nadi is Chandra Nadi.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:24.389
And landing on the lunar Nadi would
mean That you can go beyond your mind.

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:29.972
Some of then people
who land on Chandra Nadi

00:14:30.262 --> 00:14:32.262
They learn the
knowledge of ghosts.

00:14:33.569 --> 00:14:40.321
And those who run on Ida Nadi
They become arrogant monsters.

00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:43.233
Or become the arrogant
great sages,

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:48.275
whom you call brilliant but they
Cannot do anyone any good or charity.

00:14:49.257 --> 00:14:52.262
he doesn't save anyone
, however can curse someone.

00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:59.804
That's why many
mistakes did happen in matters of religion.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.875
and keep happening,

00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:08.666
And because of this the man
who appears fine to us from outside

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.266
he does not cross,

00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:13.749
And the person who appears to
be a blank gets enlightened.

00:15:14.973 --> 00:15:16.973
What is the truth?

00:15:21.447 --> 00:15:26.667
Will say that one is there is
less of interiority , or less desire;

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.704
We should understand what is
the difference between the two.

00:15:34.144 --> 00:15:39.218
A man's conciousness is completely
involved, whereas in other case a bit less.

00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:44.381
Now this is the mind of a
man that I will fast on Saturday,

00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:48.354
Now if he is unable to fast on Saturday

00:15:48.712 --> 00:15:51.440
So he will not get sleep for
at least the whole week;

00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:54.513
Such a man will never get enlightened.

00:15:55.337 --> 00:15:57.337
you keep fast on saturday

00:15:57.528 --> 00:16:00.751
And even if you do it
on Sunday, how does God care!

00:16:02.557 --> 00:16:05.820
Did he gave you birth for fasting?

00:16:06.493 --> 00:16:08.874
But you were not even
created to only eat either.

00:16:09.364 --> 00:16:13.102
The mind of a man is on
eating only as he is to fast

00:16:13.909 --> 00:16:14.915
and if not

00:16:18.605 --> 00:16:21.491
he is to only keep on eating
and thinking about it day and night

00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:24.341
In both of them
their concious is lost.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.727
Then there are many people who

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.629
must wake up at four in the morning,
even if the world turns upside down

00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:35.853
And the day he didn't
wake up at four o'clock

00:16:35.877 --> 00:16:39.020
So from five o'clock he makes it a
hell for every one; Note it secretly;

00:16:39.277 --> 00:16:41.440
Hey brother, I will wake up only
when I will feel like. If i feel good

00:16:41.464 --> 00:16:43.791
will get up,
otherwise will not get up.

00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:47.568
resolution of anything
by getting kind of wisdom

00:16:47.617 --> 00:16:51.302
Our conciousness gets maligned. (unclear:
As in Akhadi) it sticks to it.

00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:54.741
Some have this, some
have that; That man lies

00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:57.424
there like a lazy person,
in a state of oblivion;

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.913
His mind is also for this
reason that in laziness.

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:03.077
When to sleep and
where to sleep comfortably.

00:17:03.268 --> 00:17:05.268
All thoughts are about sleep

00:17:07.441 --> 00:17:11.039
Then the sleeping bed should be like this;
This arrangement should be made for him.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:13.789
I want this comfort,
I want that comfort;

00:17:14.146 --> 00:17:17.082
I want such clothes, if he doesn't
get that clothes, If different

00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:20.042
ones he gets, he will not wear
it, he will remain sitting like that.

00:17:21.182 --> 00:17:24.037
If one day his suit is not
pressed, the whole house will be on

00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:26.915
turmoil, but his
suit has to be pressed first.

00:17:30.106 --> 00:17:32.405
If her saree does not
match even slightly, then

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:34.728
she is gone;
that her body didn't match

00:17:35.068 --> 00:17:38.530
Whether she is matched
in the whole world or not?

00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:41.620
it doesn't matter, whether she has some
harmony present in her or not;

00:17:41.653 --> 00:17:43.670
It was very important that
the saree did not match;

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.680
Then from mother-in-law
to father-in-law, from top

00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:48.789
everything will get set.

00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:52.614
This is the hold of the mind,

00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:56.414
When the mind focuses on
anything considers it so important.

00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:58.167
So he can never transcend.

00:18:02.507 --> 00:18:09.632
Whenever the mind....

00:18:11.449 --> 00:18:17.074
Whenever a person's
mind gets stuck in anything,

00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:19.404
So it takes hold like this,

00:18:19.428 --> 00:18:21.658
That it gets detached with the rest of
the whole world.

00:18:21.698 --> 00:18:25.042
and no one can tell that
What are you thinking about?

00:18:25.449 --> 00:18:29.863
And it becomes mania again,
Madness, a worm enters the brain

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.206
And you tell that insect guy That
a worm has entered your mind,

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:36.708
So he will never agree;

00:18:36.714 --> 00:18:38.683
But if one does not
gets realization in Sahajayoga

00:18:38.707 --> 00:18:40.775
Then they will say
sir why didn't I transcended?

00:18:40.782 --> 00:18:42.782
Hey, a worm has
entered your mind,

00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:48.800
We can call this nervousness

00:18:49.441 --> 00:18:53.479
But that hesitation is so much;
sometimes increases to its limit.

00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:57.791
Like some people are concerned about
cleanliness, especially if it is Marathi.

00:18:58.297 --> 00:19:00.562
(Unclear: Urte can be
cleaned, Marathi can be cleaned),

00:19:01.019 --> 00:19:07.706
So that a man gets shaved in it; Let
everyone have a place inside the house

00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:11.323
(Marathi: unclear)

00:19:11.664 --> 00:19:12.710
this kind of

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:15.897
madness, sometimes you
wonder, you might have heard,

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.613
that I have some People
come for treatment, recently

00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:21.536
This one also came, I asked,
what disease does she have?

00:19:21.626 --> 00:19:24.271
She said that she
washes her hands very often

00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:27.924
and when she goes to the
bathroom, she remains sitting for hours.

00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:32.291
She scratches her hair, she doesn't
like it Looks, says, that here (unclear)

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:35.282
One is madness and
the other is that you have

00:19:35.622 --> 00:19:38.349
completely messed
up. Nothing if there is

00:19:39.273 --> 00:19:44.041
itching all over the body,
if something happens,

00:19:44.764 --> 00:19:47.941
what if malaria happens -
itching happens, no matter what!

00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:52.266
(Unclear) There is an
extreme thing, extreme is an

00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:56.086
extreme, there is
an extreme extreme.

00:19:56.459 --> 00:19:59.325
This is why your mind remains
in turmoil, it goes there, comes

00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:01.757
out there and comes
here. Like as in alcohol, one gets

00:20:02.615 --> 00:20:06.094
intoxicated; There is
intoxication of such extremes also,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.464
Now man does not understand;
He slowly descends into despair.

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:12.501
And he again says that
it is my proven my birth

00:20:12.526 --> 00:20:14.422
right that I will always
remain an extra person,

00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:17.822
And the whole world is asking for
it saying, Baba, keep them cool.

00:20:18.612 --> 00:20:20.612
Baba, may God protect them?

00:20:20.768 --> 00:20:22.768
Baba, please fix them somehow.

00:20:24.742 --> 00:20:27.917
Descent into extremeness is
not the path of Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.190
The path of Sahaja
Yoga is in the middle.

00:20:36.831 --> 00:20:40.528
Now if someone wants to earn money,
Like mad he started earning money.

00:20:42.018 --> 00:20:44.018
This is a madness,

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:47.635
He was not satisfied, He
has been earning all his life.

00:20:48.241 --> 00:20:50.468
If someone is after a
position, then he will follow the

00:20:50.492 --> 00:20:53.061
position; They were just running
after position, they were not satisfied.

00:20:53.134 --> 00:20:56.598
The other side is that also

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.756
AUDIO SYSTEM FAILURE

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:03.852
That he also wrote
a poem on beggary;

00:21:09.193 --> 00:21:11.193
So those who live in slum areas,

00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:14.031
and the palaces that
for those who live in

00:21:14.055 --> 00:21:16.784
this world, this Sahaja
Yoga is not for them;

00:21:18.324 --> 00:21:20.785
Who can build ten palaces
even after living in one

00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:23.270
palace Want to, this
Sahaja Yoga is not for them.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.003
Sahaja Yoga is for the
one and for the human being

00:21:29.027 --> 00:21:31.269
who has satisfaction in his mind.

00:21:33.026 --> 00:21:36.801
He thinks that enough is
enough, its enough of earning,

00:21:37.158 --> 00:21:38.375
And it's too much to achieve,

00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:40.566
A little just more for food
and drinks; Once the

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.521
arrangements are made, it
continues and I am satisfied.

00:21:44.445 --> 00:21:46.861
The man who lives in
palaces to be satisfied and

00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:49.300
now opts for Sahaja
Yoga, he is behind in que.

00:21:49.757 --> 00:21:52.059
Inside the man who
lives in the slum I should there be

00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:54.933
satisfaction and if he opts, he is
behind in the que for Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:55.056 --> 00:21:57.198
Contentment is a middle path,

00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:03.328
And when man
lives in contentment

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:05.885
Then his chakras
do not open much

00:22:06.424 --> 00:22:08.424
There is not much
pressure on it;

00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:16.993
Many ideas of duty are
also present in our mind,

00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:21.899
overdoing; it falls
against Sahaja Yoga

00:22:22.106 --> 00:22:24.106
The extreme worker does
not engage in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:25.629 --> 00:22:29.037
Its meaning, what it is; this
must be told clearly to you;

00:22:31.561 --> 00:22:35.743
I am not against anything, Those who want
to earn money like crazy should earn it

00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:38.001
And those who have
to beg, let them beg.

00:22:38.207 --> 00:22:40.732
Anyone doesn't care
about reforming them.

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:44.989
But those who want to come to Sahaja
Yoga They should understand that

00:22:45.096 --> 00:22:47.396
There will definitely be
some satisfaction to be had.

00:22:52.585 --> 00:22:57.284
The second thing is that when
those people,who are very vindictive,

00:22:58.808 --> 00:23:02.145
Like I know Marathi a little bit
well; I can better explain in Marathi;

00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:05.506
Because I have seen it
extensively, that's why.

00:23:05.647 --> 00:23:08.543
(Marathi: I like it better in Marathi)
NOT CLEAR

00:23:11.508 --> 00:23:14.033
(Marathi: I like it better in Marathi)
NOT CLEAR

00:23:14.057 --> 00:23:16.582
(Marathi: I like it better in Marathi)
NOT CLEAR

00:23:19.038 --> 00:23:22.357
Here's what I
don't like about it,

00:23:22.765 --> 00:23:25.460
Who are you and where
have you become a cannon?

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.717
I don't like this, I don't like that
I don't like whose language it is.

00:23:34.224 --> 00:23:37.107
It is of no use for Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.644
And the man who is vindictive

00:23:39.768 --> 00:23:41.679
Someone molested you; Get lost.

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:44.296
I don't have time to
talk to such a beggar.

00:23:45.352 --> 00:23:47.352
Nor I have time for the calls of the rich,

00:23:47.542 --> 00:23:50.202
I don't have time like this
To talk to useless people.

00:23:50.709 --> 00:23:53.055
Only when this is achieved,
Sahaja Yoga is formed;

00:23:53.195 --> 00:23:57.143
Because Sahaja Yoga is this evolution;
This is a path which is in the middle.

00:23:57.816 --> 00:23:59.738
These people who
are at a crease, I told

00:23:59.762 --> 00:24:01.966
you earlier that there
they will be missing links.

00:24:02.756 --> 00:24:07.588
When you live in the state of evolution;
Then people will call them missing links

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:09.205
who will remain on one crease;

00:24:13.578 --> 00:24:17.028
Therefore, its cure will be to
bring forgiveness in man.

00:24:19.568 --> 00:24:21.568
First there should
be satisfaction and

00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:26.719
second if you forgive someone; If you
forgive, half your energy will increase.

00:24:28.227 --> 00:24:29.775
Understand that you abused me;

00:24:30.898 --> 00:24:35.378
Now let me see how I am to
abuse; Now I don't know how to abuse!

00:24:36.451 --> 00:24:39.614
So I went to my friend saying I
heard that you know; If he

00:24:39.638 --> 00:24:42.801
abuses me then you tell me
which abuse I should give him.

00:24:43.708 --> 00:24:46.810
Now I am thinking that;
I ran here and there;

00:24:47.384 --> 00:24:49.770
Now, one abused me; i said
ok Forgive him, the work

00:24:49.794 --> 00:24:52.128
is finished. That's
the end of one chapter,

00:24:53.084 --> 00:24:55.084
nothing further to do.

00:24:56.724 --> 00:25:00.104
And as soon as you forgive; On the
other hand, that man will also change.

00:25:01.794 --> 00:25:05.629
There is no greater effort than this;
There is no better weapon than this;

00:25:05.853 --> 00:25:07.853
So know to forgive!

00:25:12.076 --> 00:25:15.158
The day you learn this mantra
âForgivenessâ, the same very day.

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:20.841
Your Kundilini will
pierce Sahastrar.

00:25:23.282 --> 00:25:25.282
Similarly on Agnya Chakra

00:25:26.089 --> 00:25:28.569
It is very difficult to
pierce for the Kundilini here.

00:25:33.792 --> 00:25:36.658
If Kundilini stops
at this place,

00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:40.348
If there are some problems
in your Ajna Chakra So

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:42.951
the first thing is that you
have to learn to forgive.

00:25:43.891 --> 00:25:49.051
When thoughts come in mind against
someone, you ask to be careful; Forgive.

00:25:51.624 --> 00:25:54.375
If anyone comes, please give
him a ticket, saying I forgive!

00:25:54.899 --> 00:25:57.852
Come on now, you come
second you You hit me the

00:25:57.876 --> 00:26:00.829
day before yesterday;
Forgave! Come on, go out;

00:26:01.707 --> 00:26:06.487
You came third, you
abused me; forgave! Let's go.

00:26:07.627 --> 00:26:12.108
He came fourth and dis-respected; Forgave!

00:26:14.898 --> 00:26:17.103
The man who cannot
forgive on Agnya Chakra, his

00:26:17.127 --> 00:26:19.332
Agnya Chakra can be
cured with great difficulty.

00:26:24.639 --> 00:26:28.061
Not this; Only to tell this mother!
Yes, I have forgiven everyone;

00:26:28.318 --> 00:26:30.867
You are for yourself,
this in your own mind,

00:26:31.074 --> 00:26:33.566
Say with pure
emotion that I forgive.

00:26:38.056 --> 00:26:40.025
Because not forgiving means that

00:26:40.082 --> 00:26:42.242
all your energy is used up

00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:46.281
In this very thing that how to beat him,
set him right, Do this to him, to book him,

00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:49.064
Give him four abuses, he
gives four abuses, you abuse ten,

00:26:49.337 --> 00:26:52.334
go this way, for this fear, for four
months, go that way for four months;

00:27:05.341 --> 00:27:08.583
By saying name of forgiveness, it will
make a difference to your Agnya Chakra.

00:27:09.656 --> 00:27:11.454
Your forgiveness
is such a big thing.

00:27:14.195 --> 00:27:18.796
And the third thing, for Sahaj
Yogi's it is very necessary for

00:27:19.419 --> 00:27:21.419
there should be
love in their heart.

00:27:23.042 --> 00:27:25.042
The heart must be clean,

00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:29.083
There must be
purification of the heart;

00:27:29.623 --> 00:27:33.190
Those who cheat,
do backbiting, tell lies

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.310
Sometimes they say to this, sometime
to that, they speak evil behind one's back.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:47.541
Such people never ascend.

00:27:48.547 --> 00:27:50.965
Even after realization, they
continue to behave like this.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.408
Yes, will catch again and
again, will do this, will do that.

00:27:53.915 --> 00:27:56.920
the Heart Chakra of those
people, who do passing

00:27:56.944 --> 00:27:59.948
game of events from one
to another, gets caught.

00:28:01.455 --> 00:28:03.822
And Agnya Chakra too will
definitely catch up with it,

00:28:04.112 --> 00:28:06.412
Because there is less sense
of forgiveness in that also.

00:28:11.536 --> 00:28:14.699
Its very hard for the God to
forgive such people

00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:20.188
who are deceit, fraud,
arrogant, lie

00:28:21.879 --> 00:28:23.491
Without any realization,

00:28:24.647 --> 00:28:26.445
the man without ascent

00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:29.819
preaches on religion

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.201
commits a big crime,
that God never forgives.

00:28:37.492 --> 00:28:39.492
without realization

00:28:39.849 --> 00:28:43.558
One who does any work
in the name of religion

00:28:44.531 --> 00:28:47.784
that person is a great
sinner in the eyes of God.

00:28:48.057 --> 00:28:50.168
And that is why God
does not forgive this.

00:28:54.092 --> 00:28:55.542
Who in the society,

00:28:57.615 --> 00:29:01.282
by sitting in temples
and mosques

00:29:02.872 --> 00:29:05.282
earns money in
the name of religion

00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:09.403
there is no one more unrighteous
and despicable than him.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.208
I told you that I
went to Mathura

00:29:14.181 --> 00:29:20.233
So I noticed that as many Kansa's
Generals were there

00:29:21.156 --> 00:29:24.016
and all the demons he had,

00:29:24.456 --> 00:29:27.337
after being born in Kalyuga,
Panda Giri has fallen there.

00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:33.228
It is like this in
every religion.

00:29:36.118 --> 00:29:39.366
All the demons wore
the garb of religion

00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:43.790
But their crime is unpardonable;

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:52.048
By standing in the court of God
and you daring to cheat God,

00:29:54.705 --> 00:30:00.039
There is no greater
foolishness than this.

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:13.279
And of all things,

00:30:15.219 --> 00:30:17.758
The 'True' way of all things,

00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:24.848
which is inside man

00:30:25.355 --> 00:30:29.453
the quality that
should be there is purity.

00:30:30.476 --> 00:30:31.586
You say innocence,

00:30:34.775 --> 00:30:35.925
holy!

00:30:39.898 --> 00:30:41.898
Keep yourself pure.

00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:44.901
Do not listen to anyone's evil,

00:30:45.674 --> 00:30:47.185
Do not harm anyone,

00:30:48.492 --> 00:30:51.405
Don't let any impure
feelings come into your mind,

00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:53.754
This is the truth

00:30:55.449 --> 00:31:00.101
that Sahaja Yoga
Comes to fruition after.

00:31:02.491 --> 00:31:05.401
That's why small
children transcend very quickly,

00:31:06.023 --> 00:31:07.425
And get it.

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:13.529
Truth of all things

00:31:14.786 --> 00:31:16.786
Flows from the feet
of Shri Ganesha,

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.243
Which we know as purity.

00:31:21.132 --> 00:31:23.404
due to which the entire
universe was created

00:31:24.162 --> 00:31:27.441
And due to which the
creation will also be destroyed;

00:31:28.164 --> 00:31:31.529
And due to which the
entire universe may evolve

00:31:31.553 --> 00:31:34.918
and doing this a new human
being can also be created,

00:31:36.008 --> 00:31:38.668
Who has to establish
Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:41.425 --> 00:31:43.694
Therefore the man in whom

00:31:43.817 --> 00:31:45.817
there no ritual of purity

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.640
He is not human!
