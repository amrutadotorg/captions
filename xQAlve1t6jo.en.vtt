00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.100
I bow to all the seekers of absolute truth.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:24.460
At the very outset, I have to say that truth is truth.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.340
This absolute truth cannot be changed because it is absolute.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.380
It cannot be transformed.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.980
It cannot be explained

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.300
because it cannot be described: truth has to be experienced.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.540
It’s an experience.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.940
In Sanskrit language, we have a word called Veda.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.780
It comes from the word ‘vida’. ‘Vida’ means to know on your central nervous system.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.940
Like, I can feel this [armchair].

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.420
In the same way, you must know the truth on your fingertips.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.220
‘Bodh” also, from where the word Buddha has come, is that enlightenment;

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.740
you have to feel it on your central nervous system.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:44.740
So, this absolute truth is what it was and is and will be.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.420
But I would request you not to believe me

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.300
because this blind faith has caused so much trouble to us.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.100
All the people are fighting all over the world with this blind faith.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.420
They believe in this and they believe in that, believe in that.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.380
This kind of faith is not going to help us.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.060
We have to feel it ourselves and experience it.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.020
Unless and until you experience,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.140
please don’t have faith in me or in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:33.820
Very important it is to understand that this absolute truth is beyond your mind.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.620
We think no end of our mind.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.660
And all those who came from my country as well as from your own country,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:55.020
to deceive you and make money out of you, have used their mind very well.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.060
And your mind could not detect it. Even today, they are there.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.180
So, for you to see what is the truth, you must know that you cannot purchase it with money.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.380
This is very difficult to digest it.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.980
Many people told me in America, “Mother you can never be successful you cannot get people

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.700
because they just believe that the person who doesn’t take money has no validity.”

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.980
My experience was so horrible!

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.460
In Boston, they asked me, in the television,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.820
“How many Roll Royces you have?” [

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.380
“I have none”.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.620
I said, “My husband has only one car”. “So, you are not in the business?”

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.100
“No”.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.940
Then they said, “We cannot, we are sorry, you have to be in the business”.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.220
So, all these mental acrobats that have been going on in this country …

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.620
I’ve been hoping to come to Berkeley

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:22.900
that everybody told me that Berkeley is a place where there are people who are truly seeking the truth

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.180
and they are revolutionary.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.380
They do not accept anything that is just established.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.900
Imagine after so many years, 27 years,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.940
I am coming to Berkeley, where I was really very anxious to come.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.660
So, now the time has come that we have to know the truth.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.300
We have to know the absolute truth.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.060
I call it as a blossom time,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.780
because I find there are so many seekers of truth all over the world.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.580
And this time has come for these flowers to become the fruit.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:27.900
Very simple thing to understand that this is done by a Power within you as explained to you.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.620
Whether you believe it or not, it is there.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.580
This power has to be awakened, that’s all.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.340
A very simple thing, a journey of three to four feet that’s all.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.020
But such a simple thing, people don’t want to accept.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.700
If you say, “Eat this way”, they’ll say, “No, why not this and this way?”

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.900
Because of this mind!

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.900
This mind is the one which has created real problems for us.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.660
I am told some gentleman is making big money by telling

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.780
that how to project this mind here, and project mind there.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.980
It’s like a cocoon.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.340
In a cocoon, you dash here and dash there.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.180
When they said, “You are to be born again”. Clearly,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.700
that doesn’t mean that you put a sign board here:

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.700
‘born again’. No.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.700
Born again means something has to happen to your consciousness,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.700
to your awareness. You have to be truthful about it.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.180
How can you be satisfied with something which is not the truth?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.940
So, what is the truth?

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:06.540
Truth, if you understand, is not this body, this mind, these emotions, these thoughts, and this ego.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.340
But it is that you are the pure Spirit.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.980
You are the pure Spirit.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.820
You have to become the pure Spirit, that’s all.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.180
This is what is the second birth.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.820
In the Bible, Christ has said, “You have to be born again”.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.060
In every religion, it is said that you are to be born again.
