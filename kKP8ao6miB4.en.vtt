00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.875
Today, we are going to worship the Maha Lakshmi

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:40.417
which I think is very much worshipped in this country where they worship Her as Maria

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:46.542
and also there’s a swayambu of Maria, you must have seen.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:53.959
And also there was an apparition of Her. First I never believed that it could be,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:06:00.291
but then after feeling the vibrations, now I know it was true,

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.917
that She did appear here in an apparition.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:08.667
She appeared before Me, also, you must have seen, in a photograph.

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:22.792
This is the principle by which you have risen to this state.

00:06:22.834 --> 00:06:30.417
The central path of your ascent is created by Maha Lakshmi power

00:06:30.417 --> 00:06:33.750
for the Kundalini to rise.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.125
In the temple of Maha Lakshmi in Kholapur

00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:42.041
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude, Ambe.”

00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:48.375
So I asked the people there, “Why do you sing Ambe’s song

00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:52.333
in Maha Lakshmi’s temple?” So they said that,

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:59.667
“We don’t know why we do it, but is it wrong?” I said, “No,

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:08.417
because only in the Maha Lakshmi channel Kundalini can rise

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:15.000
and Kundalini is the Umba.” That’s how, you see, they understood

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:19.500
and they were really amazed that I explained it very well

00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:23.375
‘cause from ancient times this song has been sung there

00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:26.375
and they never knew why this song is sung.

00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:36.583
Coming to the point of Maha Lakshmi, we have to understand

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:48.709
what does it do, what it’s help is that this Maha Lakshmi channel or the Maha Lakshmi’s powers have created within us

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:58.500
a proper balance, a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:04.208
Left and right has been balanced and She is the one who creates

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:13.250
and makes a wider path for Kundalini to rise.

00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:24.083
This is the path of compassion and love. Through that compassion and love

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:30.959
She creates this path because She knows that if the path is not wide enough

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:34.250
the Kundalini cannot rise.

00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:43.000
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking and when you start seeking,

00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:46.375
your Maha Lakshmi principle has been awakened.

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:54.709
That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.792
I am sorry to say that many

00:08:56.792 --> 00:09:00.625
are already lost in seeking, but there are so many

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:06.875
who have now come to the right path and to the right ascent.

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:11.417
Another thing this Maha Lakshmi principle does

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:18.000
is to allow the Kundalini’s power to go to different chakras also.

00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:23.417
To make a way to different chakras and corrects all the chakras.

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:31.999
She is a very flexible force, I should say, which guides the Kundalini into different chakras

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:37.750
and She understands which chakra needs the help of the Kundalini.

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:42.834
So you must have seen that when the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:48.542
where She goes, where She shows the need is of your awakening.

00:09:48.542 --> 00:10:00.792
All this works out because She is full of compassion and love

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:03.999
that you should get your absolute truth.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.208
We have many problems as it is, you know, in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.917
because when people are ascending they carry on with them

00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:19.542
some of their past stones and they cannot climb.

00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:24.750
They try then they fall, they try then they fall, then they go up again, they fall.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:32.500
But today I’m going to tell you about what is the state one has to achieve.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:41.667
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,” describes Sitha Pragya,

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:45.792
the second chapter, but it’s very difficult to understand Him,

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:48.250
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

00:10:48.291 --> 00:11:01.500
So people don’t understand what He is saying. And they ask the question,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.542
“How, how do you reach that state of Sitha Pragya? How do you get to that stage?”

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:12.500
But Ganeshwara, when he wrote his “Ganeshwari,”

00:11:12.542 --> 00:11:18.458
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means the state of Sahaj.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:32.709
He didn’t call Sitha Pragya. He called it as Sahaja Stithi, meaning the state of Sahaj.

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:40.333
So he describes the Sahaj in a very beautiful manner and very subtle.

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:44.166
Of course, Ganeshwara also, very few people understand, I think.

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:52.583
A person who reaches that state is like a mirror

00:11:52.583 --> 00:12:01.291
and so many faces pass over that mirror, so many look into that mirror,

00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:05.875
so many decorate in front of the mirror,

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:09.625
but mirror is the same as it is.

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:15.625
So the person who is a Sitha Pragya or the person who is Sahaja

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:22.458
is not bothered about what is facing him,

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:25.583
who is facing whom, where he is.

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:31.917
He stays within himself. He contains within himself.

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:39.875
Like the sun. If the sun plays with his different rays,

00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:46.542
he is not lost. All the rays again return to him.

00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:54.083
In the same way, all the senses that we have,

00:12:54.125 --> 00:13:04.542
all the senses that are there do play around, but for a person who is in a Sahaja state

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:09.959
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference. He’s not involved. He just plays around.

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:16.999
Again, all of them come back to him. This is a state you all have to achieve.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.250
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis. But I still find people

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:23.542
lost, getting money out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:35.000
some people lost getting out of leaderships, some are lost in getting jealousies and envies and all that. So that means

00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:38.250
a lot of work has to be done, still, within.

00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:41.583
There is no need to work as such

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:43.458
if you leave everything.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.291
That’s why I always say meditate, because when you meditate,

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:54.959
what happens, that all these things that are pulling you down are finished.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:14:00.667
Gradually they disappear because you become yourself.

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:05.583
You get contained by yourself and you are never bored.

00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:08.999
I am never bored. I don’t know what boring word means, you see.

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:12.750
When it is with you or alone, I never get bored.

00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:18.542
What is there to get bored? If you are not involved into anything you never get bored.

00:14:18.583 --> 00:14:23.959
Another thing is you rise above all these things, like greed.

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:28.875
Now people who are greedy are still involved making money

00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:33.999
here, making money there, all that thing. Those people who are still full of lust

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.417
are still making, organizing, some things like that.

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:42.875
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just watch.

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:51.625
You are just a witness. You are not lost into anything that is pulling you down.

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:56.583
This state is not difficult to achieve for you, at all,

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:59.208
because you have crossed over your mind.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.709
Now all these things come to you through your mind.

00:15:02.709 --> 00:15:08.458
I’ve already said that mind is a myth, which you must accept.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.625
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas. Some people think,

00:15:14.667 --> 00:15:22.834
“Yes Mother, but - yes Mother, but - .” This “but” is coming from your brain, from your mind.

00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:26.709
The brain is reality, but not the mind.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.625
The mind says “but” and then you start feeling very depressed sometimes,

00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:35.291
unhappy, because some people feel even bad

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:43.583
because they are very good people, that there are so few Sahaja Yogis. Doesn’t matter. Just watch

00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:49.583
and this watching state, this witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:54.542
In that you become so subtle, you become yourself,

00:15:54.583 --> 00:16:00.458
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb you, nothing can change you.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:07.083
Now see the nature as it is. You know there are ninety-two elements

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:11.375
and ninety-two elements, none of them can be,

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:19.583
say for example, you cannot make silver into gold. Gold into silver.

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:24.792
The atoms are so arranged that

00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:28.208
they have certain valencies and apart from atom,

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:35.208
even molecules are so arranged that they have their own structure. You cannot change.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.041
If you try to change then you will create bombs, atomic bomb, this bomb.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.709
It’s absolutely destructive.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:47.875
It’s only human beings who can change, who can transform.

00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:53.583
Now look at the blessings that you are a human being and you can be transformed

00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:59.667
and you can be made into a new element that is the Self.

00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:02.834
This is the specialty of human beings.

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:05.875
But if somebody there is a false guru or somebody,

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:09.041
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:13.792
I have seen people who have been to false gurus, they still faint,

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:22.125
they still have problems, they still get troubled more than people who have been without them.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:26.542
They are also all right now, most of them are improved

00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:35.208
but this is one thing one should understand, that in one way when you are analyzing

00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:41.333
and when you are breaking an atom or you are breaking a molecule and trying to transform,

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:52.625
it explodes. It doesn’t work out. The other way round is that when you try to synthesize,

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:56.542
then you can form anything in the nature.

00:17:56.583 --> 00:18:04.458
Like, this has now been brought out by synthesizing, this plastic is created by synthesizing.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.583
Matter can be synthesized and can be brought together

00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:15.291
Human beings have to be synthesized also

00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:23.625
They can be synthesized better than matter because they change,

00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:30.834
they transform. Now say example, there is gold. You make gold into ornaments,

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:40.542
make into anything. It remains all the time, all the time gold. Gold is gold.

00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:49.333
It is there. It is not that by changing them into ornaments it changes. Its element is there. Gold is there.

00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:54.750
But for human beings they get transformed. When they are synthesized.

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:59.709
This is a very big difference between the matter and the nature

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:07.083
and human beings. Matter, nature, are different absolutely

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:12.792
from human beings. Human beings, once they are transformed,

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:19.834
it’s like a living process. They become like flowers

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:28.750
but still it is not that you see in the nature. It’s not the same as you see in the nature

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:35.291
because nature doesn’t have a mind. It doesn’t have a mind. It just is

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:42.834
under the control of the Divine or nature that it’s working out that way.

00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:46.959
But here you are under your own control.

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:52.291
Here you can control yourself.

00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:56.792
In this synthesis which is growing inside you

00:19:56.792 --> 00:20:01.875
what you find, that you are completely in control of yourself.

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:05.458
You know what is happening to you.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.750
Now you start seeing yourself separating from all these things.

00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:16.709
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother, see, my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:24.834
He sees his ego, he sees what is the problem is. Somebody says, “Mother, my nabhi is very bad,

00:20:24.834 --> 00:20:28.250
I’m still busy with the money.” He sees it.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:33.458
First starts the knowledge about yourself,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:40.417
we call as self-knowledge. But one has to even go beyond self-knowledge.

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:53.250
By that knowledge, what do you do, we have to see? When you have the knowledge, first we say there’s no knowledge,

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:56.208
people have no knowledge, they are ignorant, there’s darkness,

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:02.750
all that. Now the light has come, you can see. You can know what’s wrong within you.

00:21:02.792 --> 00:21:09.709
Now you start separating yourself from all those things that you see as wrong with you.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.792
You see them getting out.

00:21:12.792 --> 00:21:20.709
So many nonsensical things there are. Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed and lust.

00:21:20.709 --> 00:21:24.583
I mean, it’s horrible things to say on a Diwali function, see.

00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:31.375
So the Diwali is that one by one so many lights are enlightened

00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:39.583
and you start seeing it first. First you start seeing what is wrong with you and then,

00:21:39.625 --> 00:21:46.583
as you see it, you don’t want it. Then you work out to get rid of it,

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:49.000
to become clean.

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:53.625
Now this also knowledge disappears.

00:21:53.667 --> 00:22:01.166
You don’t have to have any knowledge. You are there. You are there.

00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:06.333
There is no need to know about your chakras, you are just there.

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:14.959
At that stage nothing matters. You become just like a stone,

00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:19.875
I can say. Stone with a brain intact and a heart intact

00:22:19.917 --> 00:22:26.458
and a liver intact. You just don’t mind anything, don’t get upset with anything.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:35.999
You just enjoy the love and compassion that’s flowing.

00:22:35.999 --> 00:22:38.834
And the ripples that come back to you,

00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:41.875
even that is lost after some time

00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:44.750
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:51.500
That is the state people achieved. In those days they achieved this state.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:58.750
But with that, what lacking happened, that they’d get lost. They all got lost. They couldn’t do anything to others.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:04.458
One person getting it, becoming great, finished. Or two persons at the most.

00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:11.208
So now Sahaja Yoga stands first of all at the knowledge state,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:16.583
where you have the knowledge. First, you should first of all have full knowledge

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:20.333
about yourself. The self-knowledge should be complete.

00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:25.667
Then in the third stage we should say that when the knowledge is full

00:23:25.709 --> 00:23:31.250
you should get rid of all those things that you know about yourself,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.083
which are useless, which are hampering your progress,

00:23:34.083 --> 00:23:36.250
which you know is wrong.

00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:40.667
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari, I’ll just clean it out like that.

00:23:40.667 --> 00:23:46.417
Then you start separating yourself into that Sahaja state.

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:53.417
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop another dimension

00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:59.875
which is collective consciousness. That is the modern Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:05.625
In the olden days they didn’t have this, so they just all got lost.

00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:13.959
Now you have collective consciousness and in that collective consciousness you start feeling others,

00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:21.333
feeling for others, compassion for others and you start working out for others.

00:24:21.375 --> 00:24:27.542
In that also, sometimes, you know, when you are working around, you think how much money I can make,

00:24:27.542 --> 00:24:32.709
what I can achieve as a leader or some sort of thing is still there.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:37.458
But this collective consciousness starts growing.

00:24:37.458 --> 00:24:45.458
When it starts growing then you become as I said, drop in the ocean, means complete ocean.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:54.041
You become complete ocean. So the ocean has its own mariadas.

00:24:54.083 --> 00:24:58.999
It doesn’t bother. It has to live with its mariadas, it lives with its mariadas.

00:24:58.999 --> 00:25:05.417
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries, all right. Accept it. It will not cross its boundaries.

00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:11.083
In the same way it happens that you are very self-contained.

00:25:11.125 --> 00:25:19.166
You are not selfish, but you become very self-contained. You are contained within yourself.

00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:22.750
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.500
that I have not punished many horrible people

00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:27.208
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.709
I don’t have to bother. There’s Paramchaitanya

00:25:30.709 --> 00:25:34.333
which is doing a lot of work. Let it look after it.

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:39.417
Why should I bother about anyone? You see, after all, things are working out

00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:49.792
so why to interfere? My job is just to watch, just to see.

00:25:49.834 --> 00:25:56.625
That’s sufficient. There’s no need for Me to kill anybody

00:25:56.667 --> 00:26:01.041
in this lifetime or to destroy. They are destroyed by themselves.

00:26:01.083 --> 00:26:05.583
I have told you that I need not expose people,

00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:09.834
but whichever country I go, I find people get exposed.

00:26:09.875 --> 00:26:12.458
I run away from there, really, sometimes, thinking,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.750
God knows what more is going to come.

00:26:14.792 --> 00:26:18.041
Even little attention on any country,

00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:23.792
it just works out. Even without My knowledge,

00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:26.041
“Oh My God,” I said, “When did I do that?”

00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:36.083
So one has to become, of course, he becomes the power of Divine love, no doubt.

00:26:36.125 --> 00:26:43.999
He becomes the power of Divine love, but he doesn’t handle it. Left to this Divine power

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:47.709
which is working, which is also separated from Me,

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.375
you’ll be surprised. I am alone. Absolutely alone.

00:26:52.417 --> 00:26:58.083
Even this power is separated from Me, but this power knows

00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:02.709
what is good for human beings, what is good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:02.709 --> 00:27:07.458
It works on it’s own. I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex action,

00:27:07.458 --> 00:27:11.000
believe Me, it’s a reflex action. Maybe you might say,

00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:17.041
“Mother, you have made it.” All right, whatever it is, but I don’t interfere with it.

00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:23.083
I don’t have to tell anything to it. It just works and it’s working so well.

00:27:23.125 --> 00:27:27.500
I’ll give you an example. Once in England long time back, they said,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.583
“Mother, we want to have a very long summer.” I said,

00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:31.999
“Why do you want to ask such things?” “No, no, Mother,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.250
we must have a long summer, a very long summer, very - “

00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:41.208
Three or four times they said it and it was a very long, horrible summer in London.

00:27:41.208 --> 00:27:46.959
And it’s not like India where we have air conditioning, fans,

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:51.250
something we have, at least hand fans. There was nothing there.

00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:55.208
So we didn’t know. We had a little gallery, we used to sleep in that.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:04.208
So we went to the shop in England and we asked in London City, for a fan. So they said,

00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:08.667
“All right, after three months. You order us.” After three months

00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:13.458
when it will be very cold they will give us the fan. We said, “We don’t want any fans.”

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:17.500
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

00:28:17.542 --> 00:28:20.792
And that’s how we managed. You see, Indians, we feel very hot

00:28:20.834 --> 00:28:23.750
because we have had a lot of sun in our country,

00:28:23.792 --> 00:28:25.875
we feel much hotter than any one of you.

00:28:25.875 --> 00:28:30.750
The way you sit in the sun, you know, we can’t understand. You know, in India they used to say

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:34.709
an Englishman and a mad dog can only go in the sun.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:41.041
So our situation is like that, that we cannot go in the sun

00:28:41.083 --> 00:28:43.000
because we have had too much.

00:28:43.041 --> 00:28:49.792
And this summer, you see, was so tremendous, so tremendous that after that one thing good happened.

00:28:49.834 --> 00:28:56.333
That ochre color appeared on the leaves and then gradually the red

00:28:56.375 --> 00:29:00.750
and all that of the autumn season was best at that time

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.375
and then one Sahaja Yogi dreamt that, “Mother asked me

00:29:05.417 --> 00:29:07.875
to drive in Her back yard.”

00:29:07.917 --> 00:29:13.750
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been asking me to drive in the back yard.”

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.667
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t know he had dreamt like that, that,

00:29:17.709 --> 00:29:23.709
“Can you come along for a while, I want to go and see this autumn all over England.”

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.417
So he came and we were driving, miles together

00:29:27.458 --> 00:29:32.583
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was so, he told us that that was My back yard.”

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:35.750
Can you imagine that he was driving for miles together,

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.917
beautiful, just like Canada,

00:29:37.917 --> 00:29:42.333
the whole England was filled with the beauty of autumn.

00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:48.000
So even if there’s something like that happens, it is compensated.

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:54.166
It is compensated and so beautiful it was, all the people were out in the autumn

00:29:54.208 --> 00:29:57.041
to see the beautiful colors of the nature,

00:29:57.083 --> 00:30:03.417
of different greenery, yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were there.

00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:07.041
Surprisingly, in that country you never see all that.

00:30:07.083 --> 00:30:12.750
And because of the sun shining so bright, it was compensated.

00:30:12.792 --> 00:30:18.333
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya. So the Paramchaitanya

00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:29.208
is looking after this. All these things are managed by Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing. I am Nishkriya.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.625
I’m just sitting down and watching.

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:36.291
To Me nothing matters. You see, it’s working out slowly and steadily.

00:30:36.333 --> 00:30:40.417
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing, they said, “Mother, we prayed to You

00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:42.709
and it happened.” All right, maybe,

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.709
these people must have heard, around Me, Not me, you see,

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:54.417
and they must have done the job and for that I’m not responsible, in no way.

00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:58.041
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was very sick

00:30:58.041 --> 00:31:02.333
and was about to die. She wrote a letter to Me, three letters

00:31:02.333 --> 00:31:05.333
she wrote that, “My son is going to die, he’s a young fellow,

00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:09.750
studying in Harvard.” I didn’t do anything.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.999
I never wrote to her. Fourth letter came

00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:14.166
that he’s completely cured.

00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:16.959
Now I didn’t do that because I was just sitting in one place

00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:19.291
and how is it, it has worked out.

00:31:19.333 --> 00:31:22.583
So everything, you see, you think I do

00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:26.041
is not done by Me. Is done by this Paramchaitanya.

00:31:26.083 --> 00:31:30.959
Because I’m also separated from you, completely, absolutely separated.

00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:35.999
So they say, “You pray, now.” You can pray. If you pray, you pray to these deities

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.250
that are around, you pray to all these ganas and all that, not to Me.

00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:45.333
Because I have nothing to do with it. You see, they don’t tell Me

00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:48.417
that I have to do this or I have to do that, so why should I tell them

00:31:48.458 --> 00:31:52.875
do this or do that? It is like that. And in that state only

00:31:52.917 --> 00:31:55.166
we can say you are in a Sahaja state,

00:31:55.208 --> 00:31:58.375
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t want anything.

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:03.959
I do everything. All kinds of things, I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

00:32:03.959 --> 00:32:11.875
I am also doing in the sense that I’m looking after things, flowers, this that.

00:32:11.875 --> 00:32:20.500
I am also receiving presents from you, I’m receiving this from you and then see, I don’t receive anything.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.000
I don’t have anything. I have no interest in it.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.166
But you want to give for your joy, all right,

00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:31.667
have it. You want to put flowers, all right, you can have flowers.

00:32:31.709 --> 00:32:37.291
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:43.333
But as Your Mother I love you. All of you I love.

00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:46.834
But I don’t do anything as such to love you. And everybody says,

00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:48.834
“Mother, You love us so much.” When?

00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:51.458
When did I love you. I never even kissed you.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.083
But you always say I love you very much. So

00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:57.458
what is this. Who is working it out, this?

00:32:57.458 --> 00:33:02.875
Is something which is not Me, beyond Me. This is the state in which,

00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:05.917
once we rise, we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:09.375
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are doing nothing.

00:33:09.417 --> 00:33:11.333
Everything is working out.

00:33:11.375 --> 00:33:14.041
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,

00:33:14.083 --> 00:33:15.750
“Oh, we are not doing anything.

00:33:15.792 --> 00:33:19.333
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga, it’s not our job?”

00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:26.750
Just now, that’s not your stithi, that’s why. So you have to rise up

00:33:26.792 --> 00:33:28.834
to that state. That’s only possible

00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:36.792
when you are in the knowledge state, where you have self-knowledge, the knowledge of the whole world.

00:33:36.834 --> 00:33:38.750
But if you go beyond knowledge

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.792
then you must have seen many a times, I just say something.

00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:49.125
I just say something and it is there. I never feel vibrations of anyone

00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:53.208
or anything. I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor any chakras, nothing,

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.959
but I know, know automatically

00:33:55.999 --> 00:33:59.000
like a computer. But that computer also I am not.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.166
Just it’s trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:07.166
what is this stithi is because you have to achieve it. Once you achieve it

00:34:07.208 --> 00:34:11.959
then you are in a very subtle state and that subtle state

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:17.875
is nothing but bliss. But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

00:34:17.917 --> 00:34:22.917
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.

00:34:22.959 --> 00:34:26.542
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

00:34:26.583 --> 00:34:29.166
I forget even you are calling Me.

00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:32.583
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:38.166
See it is such a simple thing one has to understand

00:34:38.208 --> 00:34:41.625
that the state in which one has to rise

00:34:41.667 --> 00:34:48.083
is a state where without doing anything, everything works out. If that is your state, all right.

00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:52.208
But it’s not so. So you have to rise up to that state

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.500
by doing. First you have to do it. First you have to know

00:34:56.542 --> 00:35:01.875
and then knowledge has no need, you don’t have to know,

00:35:01.917 --> 00:35:05.792
but first that has to be worked out and brought to that level.

00:35:05.792 --> 00:35:13.208
Now Diwali has the significance that on Diwali day, what we do, we put lights all over.

00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:18.375
So that we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:35:18.417 --> 00:35:29.917
But does the light know about itself? Does the candle knows about itself?

00:35:29.959 --> 00:35:34.125
She enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

00:35:34.125 --> 00:35:44.166
Like the moon, which is giving moonlight, does it know itself?

00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:55.333
Does he enjoy? Nothing. In the same way it happens that on a Diwali day

00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:59.458
you are, what you are doing is enlightening people, you are enlightening them,

00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:04.208
you are doing all this for them, it’s a good idea. You must do it.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.375
But also know that you have to become the lamp yourself

00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:11.333
which doesn’t know yourself.

00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:16.208
So there are two messages. The first one is

00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:19.999
that we have to enlighten the world, we have to enlighten others.

00:36:19.999 --> 00:36:21.959
This is the first one. Then

00:36:21.959 --> 00:36:29.208
we have to become that which is the light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.959
Yesterday you were singing, “You are the light,” you are this thing.

00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:39.041
All right, so what? I was just saying, ‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

00:36:39.041 --> 00:36:44.583
That’s the state where you don’t know you are the light.

00:36:44.583 --> 00:36:47.750
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come into your head.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:51.750
Even so many times you have sung, you have said thousand names there are,

00:36:51.792 --> 00:36:56.583
everything, but it doesn’t come into My head that this is Me you are talking about.

00:36:56.625 --> 00:37:02.500
Now when I say this I don’t know how you will react.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.583
Because human beings are queer birds, you see.

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:10.625
You tell them something. Maybe that your ego might come up and you say,

00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:13.000
“Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.750
There are many, many who came like that, that,

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.375
“I am higher than Mataji.”

00:37:18.417 --> 00:37:22.125
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There are many who said that,

00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:29.834
“I am Kalki.” Nowadays there’s one fellow going round saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

00:37:29.834 --> 00:37:34.875
All right doesn’t matter. You be that, very good idea.

00:37:34.917 --> 00:37:50.709
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means

00:37:50.709 --> 00:37:54.999
I don’t know what I am, really. I had to say

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.417
because people said, “Mother, you have to declare.”

00:37:57.458 --> 00:38:02.375
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am. Now I find

00:38:02.417 --> 00:38:07.333
by declaration you people started growing more,

00:38:07.375 --> 00:38:09.583
so all right, have it that way.

00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:15.166
But there is no need for anyone to declare anything or to say anything.

00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:18.542
That is the state one has to achieve.

00:38:18.542 --> 00:38:22.583
But to get to that state you have to work.

00:38:22.625 --> 00:38:27.792
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have to enlighten many lights.

00:38:27.834 --> 00:38:32.333
That means you will realize that you are the light

00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:34.625
which is enlightening all that,

00:38:34.625 --> 00:38:40.208
and then in a subtle way you will realize that, “I am the light.”

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.333
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing a lot of work

00:38:43.375 --> 00:38:46.458
and working it out, spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:51.625
It’s a very great thing that has happened. In so many countries,

00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:58.959
the way it has spread, it has removed the darkness of religion which was outside.

00:38:58.959 --> 00:39:05.875
It was darkness of so many - racialism, thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:14.458
So this has worked out, the cleansing. For you to have the clean water to swim.

00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:21.000
Once you start doing that then you realize gradually

00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:26.333
that now the sea is clean, we just watch,

00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:32.667
we just see how it is working. I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve this state

00:39:32.709 --> 00:39:41.000
where you achieve your complete work of self-realization to others.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.583
Those who do not give self-realization to others,

00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:47.542
who just come for the pujas, this thing, are mediocres.

00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:50.333
They cannot rise very high.

00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:53.542
This coming to puja is what, like, you just rise higher with the puja

00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:57.583
then again you go down. But those who steadily grow

00:39:57.625 --> 00:40:01.166
will grow into this state, I am sure, in My lifetime

00:40:01.208 --> 00:40:08.125
I should be able to see such people who are such that if they stand here they emit peace,

00:40:08.166 --> 00:40:13.500
they emit light, they emit everything. Because they are the light. They don’t have to enlighten,

00:40:13.542 --> 00:40:18.417
but they are the light. Such a stage has to be developed

00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:20.959
and to be worked out within yourself.

00:40:20.999 --> 00:40:26.917
And this state has been described by so many poets, so many saints and everything,

00:40:26.917 --> 00:40:29.834
but they were at that stage and people thought,

00:40:29.875 --> 00:40:32.375
what is this they are talking? They thought they were mad.

00:40:32.417 --> 00:40:36.583
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be crucified, because they couldn’t understand it.

00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:40.999
Now you are gradually growing one by one, step by step,

00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:46.166
so now you understand this. You understand Christ, you understand all these people

00:40:46.208 --> 00:40:50.333
and at this stage you have still to work.

00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:54.542
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga cannot rise higher.

00:40:54.583 --> 00:41:01.000
You have to work for Sahaja Yoga, you have to spread it more, you have to work it out,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.542
enjoy each other, this brotherhood, everything.

00:41:04.583 --> 00:41:11.500
All the qualities of a beautiful personality should be there.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:19.583
Unless and until you achieve that state, then you can only rise higher

00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:22.667
to that stage which I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi.

00:41:22.709 --> 00:41:25.250
In that state you will be perfect.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.834
But you must get rid of all these things

00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:34.166
and today is a day, also of Maha Lakshmi. The first thing is, I think,

00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:38.542
this madness about money. This should be understood

00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:43.000
that it’s real madness. Those who are rich have no money.

00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:44.917
You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

00:41:44.917 --> 00:41:48.792
“Oh, I have no money.” Why? What is all this? This is no money.

00:41:48.834 --> 00:41:51.333
You ask the poor man, he has no money.

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:53.083
A rich man has no money.

00:41:53.125 --> 00:41:59.333
So it’s a kind of a greed which is never satisfied,

00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:05.208
which never helps you. All these little, little things have to first drop out.

00:42:05.208 --> 00:42:08.375
Then your work should cleanse you. In your work

00:42:08.375 --> 00:42:10.999
you will know whether you are cleansing or not.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.709
In the work you will know how you are doing your work.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:17.583
Once that is done, then I think

00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:20.583
I am sure some of you will achieve that state

00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:27.083
in My lifetime, in your lifetime. That’s what I want today to tell you, on a Diwali day,

00:42:27.125 --> 00:42:31.583
that we have to become subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:42:31.625 --> 00:42:35.041
We should not be influenced by outside things.

00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:41.959
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort of a fashion starts.

00:42:41.999 --> 00:42:49.999
People who follow fashions are stupid. They are like blind mices.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.999
Anybody can lead them into anything,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.375
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

00:42:54.417 --> 00:43:02.000
So if you try to follow any kind of a thought which is given to us by somebody else,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.291
in that thought you’ll completely lose yourself

00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:09.999
and you’ll become, “I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu, I am Muslim.”

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.875
And when you become the Spirit then you start knowing so much

00:43:25.875 --> 00:43:28.875
and this knowledge is very important.

00:43:28.917 --> 00:43:34.333
This is the gap between a saint and a normal human being,

00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:36.999
which you have crossed gradually

00:43:36.999 --> 00:43:40.166
so you know what are the problems of the human beings are

00:43:40.208 --> 00:43:44.291
and dealing with human beings, you know how to deal with them.

00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:48.250
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective consciousness,

00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:50.458
in modern times, has come.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.125
This collective consciousness, also the saints had,

00:43:54.125 --> 00:44:01.125
but they would not say. They would not say anything. They would not bother.

00:44:01.166 --> 00:44:03.417
All right, this fellow has this chakra,

00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:06.041
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

00:44:06.083 --> 00:44:09.291
It’s not a question of not caring, but not bothered.

00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:11.375
They were sitting in a state which

00:44:11.417 --> 00:44:14.667
was just recording, all right.

00:44:14.709 --> 00:44:21.667
An ugly man goes before the mirror, all right, if a beautiful person goes before the mirror is all right.

00:44:21.709 --> 00:44:28.834
In the same way these people start allowing people to pass through

00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:32.041
but we have to understand, still we have to grow.

00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:37.917
We have to still grow by working it out. Those people who are working it out

00:44:37.917 --> 00:44:47.709
and spreading it all over are the ones which are really very much there

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:56.834
and to them, I must say, the Paramchaitanya is just their servant.

00:44:56.875 --> 00:45:02.250
I have seen people who desire something, it works out.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:07.917
They ask for something, it works out. For that, now,

00:45:07.917 --> 00:45:09.959
what should we have, is the point.

00:45:09.959 --> 00:45:14.417
After getting realization, after getting everything,

00:45:14.458 --> 00:45:20.375
what should we have that we develop is the faith. Faith in yourself.

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:29.999
Faith in that you are the Spirit, that you have the light

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.667
and you have to enlighten others.

00:45:32.709 --> 00:45:41.125
This faith when it grows deeper and deeper then you think,

00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:46.083
oh, what I am. I am the Spirit.

00:45:46.083 --> 00:45:50.792
If you are the Spirit then this whole nature is with you.

00:45:50.834 --> 00:45:58.208
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them was a fisherman.

00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:02.834
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has tremendous faith in Me

00:46:02.834 --> 00:46:09.542
and somehow he was going to another village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:16.917
When he came out of his little hut he found it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

00:46:16.917 --> 00:46:21.291
So he raised his hand and said, “See now, I’m going for Mother’s work.

00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:23.917
And you dare not start raining.

00:46:23.917 --> 00:46:28.875
You keep as you are, hanging there till I finish my work,” you see.

00:46:28.917 --> 00:46:31.291
Because he was going by boat.

00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:34.417
And other Sahaja Yogis thought, “What is he talking about?”

00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:38.083
They all got into the boat, they reached the other village.

00:46:38.083 --> 00:46:42.083
They gave realization to others, he finished his lecturing, everything,

00:46:42.125 --> 00:46:45.250
he came back on the shore and he entered his house.

00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:46.083
When he was closing the door,

00:46:46.125 --> 00:46:50.750
“All right, so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

00:46:50.792 --> 00:46:56.041
So the complete faith that this Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

00:46:56.083 --> 00:46:59.667
is all the time waiting there to serve you.

00:46:59.667 --> 00:47:02.083
Whatever you say will happen.

00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:06.083
But first you must have complete faith in yourself

00:47:06.083 --> 00:47:07.999
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:12.000
Even now I find, you see, people have some lust,

00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:15.709
some sort of a horrible things in them.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.291
So first you must be established in Dharma.

00:47:19.333 --> 00:47:24.834
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness. If you are in the righteousness,

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:29.792
there’s no question. There’s no question that this Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

00:47:29.834 --> 00:47:34.834
But supposing you want today something and it doesn’t work out,

00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:39.125
then even to get disappointed itself is not a very good thing.

00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:48.583
Disappointment also is a sign of your immaturity.

00:47:48.625 --> 00:47:50.667
What is there to be disappointed?

00:47:50.709 --> 00:47:57.208
Maybe that that was good for you.

00:47:57.208 --> 00:48:02.959
Supposing I lose My way. I’m going this way and I lose My way,

00:48:02.999 --> 00:48:07.041
I don’t know where to go. So I get lost, it’s all right. What is there? Wherever I am,

00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:10.667
I am there. How can I be lost to Myself.

00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:14.208
And then what I find, that I had to go that way

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:18.542
because I was to meet somebody, I’ve been wanting to meet somebody

00:48:18.542 --> 00:48:24.792
and meet that person there. Can you imagine? Such things happen with Me,

00:48:24.834 --> 00:48:26.917
and even if I don’t meet, so what?

00:48:26.917 --> 00:48:30.917
I was to go that side. I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.

00:48:30.959 --> 00:48:35.834
It’s like that. So once you know that whatever you are doing

00:48:35.834 --> 00:48:40.959
in command, full command, full faith,

00:48:40.999 --> 00:48:45.417
actually the whole authority comes to you

00:48:45.458 --> 00:48:49.375
through your faith which word is satta in Sanskrit,

00:48:49.375 --> 00:48:51.291
meaning the truth. The truth gives you the authority.

00:48:51.333 --> 00:49:00.083
Now another thing which is important is the faith in your guru.

00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:07.375
If you have faith in your guru, Paramchaitanya is kind

00:49:07.417 --> 00:49:10.875
to you. It’s very helpful. But if you doubt,

00:49:10.875 --> 00:49:14.291
then Paramchaitanya also doubts you

00:49:14.333 --> 00:49:18.291
because Paramchaitanya knows you through your guru,

00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:21.750
whether it is Me or any other real guru, it’s the same.

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:25.999
But with Me, of course, because, you know,

00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:27.458
I’m very forgiving so people

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.999
start taking liberties.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.792
With another guru, you see, he will beat them.

00:49:32.834 --> 00:49:38.041
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things to you if you are not there.

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:40.750
So I’ve told you many stories about the gurus,

00:49:40.792 --> 00:49:43.625
how they treat - good gurus - their disciples.

00:49:43.667 --> 00:49:47.291
But I forgive. I don’t say anything. Let it be, it doesn’t matter.

00:49:47.333 --> 00:49:50.583
Because I think by leaving them alone only,

00:49:50.583 --> 00:49:53.291
they will rise and they will come up to this stage.

00:49:53.291 --> 00:49:58.083
But it happens sometimes that it may work the other way round,

00:49:58.125 --> 00:50:05.041
that if they are forgiven, then they take it for granted.

00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:08.959
All rigth , there is freedom, you can take it for granted

00:50:18.417 --> 00:50:19.792
So the faith in yourself is with patience you watch

00:50:19.834 --> 00:50:24.125
and do not get disappointed with anything whatsoever.

00:50:24.166 --> 00:50:29.625
Now, just imagine so many people have got realization, so many saints in this world,

00:50:29.667 --> 00:50:35.458
have you seen? Yesterday I was surprised the way the French were singing so well.

00:50:35.458 --> 00:50:40.375
You know, first time I had to take a harmonium to teach them how to sing one line

00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:44.792
Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

00:50:44.834 --> 00:50:48.959
The same French have reached

00:50:50.417 --> 00:50:52.333
that state of creativity. You see,

00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:56.208
all your potential will rise. It will express itself,

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:00.500
but be careful not to get into ego about it.

00:51:00.542 --> 00:51:07.583
Gradually it will flower and others who are surrounding you will get the fragrance of it

00:51:07.583 --> 00:51:13.999
and they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga. That is the blessing at that time, the blessing of the real Divine

00:51:13.999 --> 00:51:18.458
will be that you’ll be raised to the state which we call as a perfect,

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:25.291
‘purnattwa’, complete. That completeness will come. But you judge yourself.

00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:34.375
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj? Are you absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

00:51:34.375 --> 00:51:37.959
Or other things are more important to you than Sahaja Yoga?

00:51:37.999 --> 00:51:43.291
Then, go ahead.

00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:49.667
There is something to be understood very clearly that there’s no competition

00:51:49.709 --> 00:51:53.291
in Sahaja Yoga. Cannot be. There’s no competition.

00:51:53.333 --> 00:52:01.625
There’s no envy, there is no back biting, nothing. It is, you are different people. You are saints.

00:52:01.792 --> 00:52:07.083
Your style is different. You are absolutely above

00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:10.125
all these things. You cannot be dishonest,

00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:14.750
you cannot cheat people, you cannot do this. And if you are doing that,

00:52:14.792 --> 00:52:21.500
even now, then please try to understand that you have still to grow into it.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.834
Some big people think

00:52:23.834 --> 00:52:30.542
they are very high up in Sahaja Yoga. It’s not so, it’s not so.

00:52:30.583 --> 00:52:36.750
If by thinking what you are, then you are lost.

00:52:36.792 --> 00:52:42.542
What you have to do is to understand “What have I done?

00:52:42.542 --> 00:52:45.583
How many people have I given realization,

00:52:45.583 --> 00:52:48.208
to how many people have talked about it?”

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:51.500
People are shy, even, to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:51.542 --> 00:52:54.375
I have seen one lady was traveling with Me. Very hot.

00:52:54.375 --> 00:53:01.959
I said, “Ba, ba who is she, this one? I don’t know.” So she told Me the name of her guru. She said, “My guru is like this, guru like that, like that.”

00:53:01.999 --> 00:53:06.750
I said, “My God, this heat coming out of this woman and she’s talking so much.”

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:11.208
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:16.542
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends but they will never

00:53:16.583 --> 00:53:20.041
tell them what Sahaja Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:24.333
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties, you see, if the others are drinking they’ll say,

00:53:24.333 --> 00:53:27.250
“All right, I don’t drink.” But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:31.542
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.” They will not say that.

00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:38.291
So this is the third point, one has to know the announcement.

00:53:38.291 --> 00:53:42.500
You must have faith in yourself and you must announce.

00:53:42.542 --> 00:53:45.041
All the saints announced.

00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:49.792
They were killed for that, you saw how Socrates was given poison.

00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:53.417
Doesn’t matter. Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these modern times,

00:53:53.458 --> 00:53:58.208
there’s fundamental rights to exist. So nobody can kill you, take it from Me,

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:03.125
but you must announce. And the announcement should be with full faith

00:54:03.125 --> 00:54:07.500
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga, how important it is.

00:54:07.542 --> 00:54:13.417
The purpose is to transform the whole world.

00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:17.709
With your transformation the whole world transforms.

00:54:17.709 --> 00:54:22.875
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise, Sahaja Yoga

00:54:22.917 --> 00:54:26.041
is extremely complicated because how it works.

00:54:26.083 --> 00:54:31.625
The other day, you remember, the mike had failed completely

00:54:31.667 --> 00:54:36.041
and I was giving the lecture and still I was talking.

00:54:36.083 --> 00:54:40.542
The mike had failed but everybody was listening to Me.

00:54:40.542 --> 00:54:45.959
What had happened? Did I enter into the ether? What happened? I don’t know.

00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:50.583
I didn’t even know that mike had failed. I was thinking there is mike,

00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:54.999
that the way people were listening to Me,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.041
but then they told that half lecture was without the mike.

00:54:58.083 --> 00:55:02.583
And everybody was absolutely listening to Me.

00:55:02.625 --> 00:55:15.000
You see, it is something that one has to wonder and appreciate

00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:18.291
what things are happening now, where are we going.

00:55:20.291 --> 00:55:21.500
We are going into the Kingdom of God

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:26.500
and all the blessings, all the bliss will be on you.

00:55:26.542 --> 00:55:34.166
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything becomes one, nothing but bliss

00:55:34.208 --> 00:55:39.709
and you are in that state of bliss which you don’t even know,

00:55:39.709 --> 00:55:44.959
you are just there. The greatest bliss is that you don’t know even anything,

00:55:44.959 --> 00:55:47.583
you’re just there.

00:55:47.625 --> 00:55:50.458
I hope all of you achieve that state

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.291
with this Diwali being done in Portugal,

00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:58.333
which is a special place, I think, of Maha Lakshmi because She appeared here

00:55:58.333 --> 00:56:01.583
as they say and also this swayambu that we have,

00:56:01.583 --> 00:56:05.375
also is that of Maha Lakshmi face, so I’m sure

00:56:05.417 --> 00:56:07.500
it will work out for all of you.

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.542
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking about

00:56:10.583 --> 00:56:17.375
but it is, I have to tell you, that one has to rise up to that state

00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:22.583
and that state is very, very easy to achieve for you.

00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:26.667
It slowly, gradually it - then you don’t have to do anything,

00:56:26.667 --> 00:56:29.208
you go into a village and everything would be there.

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.375
See, now, what happened. I went to Cairo.

00:56:31.375 --> 00:56:34.583
Everybody was saluting Me. I was wondering,

00:56:34.583 --> 00:56:37.500
what has happened to them? I went to Leningrad,

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.625
thousands came to My program. I asked them,

00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:41.542
“How did you come to My program?” They said,

00:56:41.583 --> 00:56:48.166
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s obvious.” They just saw a small, little advertisement in the newspaper,

00:56:48.208 --> 00:56:50.542
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.”

00:56:50.583 --> 00:56:54.959
That should happen. And then you can announce

00:56:54.999 --> 00:56:58.500
that Sahaja Yoga is the only way, then you can announce.

00:56:58.542 --> 00:57:03.959
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to say something to their friends and things.

00:57:03.999 --> 00:57:08.333
And you must know that all of those who you love, who you know,

00:57:08.375 --> 00:57:11.999
will go to hell or where - they’ll hang in the limbo or what?

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.083
If you have achieved it you should pull them out also.

00:57:15.125 --> 00:57:19.041
They may not. They may not be seekers, doesn’t matter now.

00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:21.625
I think we are finished with the seekers now,

00:57:21.667 --> 00:57:23.417
must be - we must have people

00:57:23.458 --> 00:57:26.917
who are not so seeking, it looks like that.

00:57:26.959 --> 00:57:30.375
So may God bless you all
