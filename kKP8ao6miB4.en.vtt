WEBVTT

05:22.750 --> 05:29.875
Today, we are going to worship the Maha Lakshmi

05:29.917 --> 05:40.417
which I think is very much worshipped in this country where they worship Her as Maria

05:40.417 --> 05:46.542
and also there’s a swayambu of Maria, you must have seen.

05:46.583 --> 05:53.959
And also there was an apparition of Her. First I never believed that it could be,

05:53.959 --> 06:00.291
but then after feeling the vibrations, now I know it was true,

06:00.291 --> 06:03.917
that She did appear here in an apparition.

06:03.959 --> 06:08.667
She appeared before Me, also, you must have seen, in a photograph.

06:08.709 --> 06:22.792
This is the principle by which you have risen to this state.

06:22.834 --> 06:30.417
The central path of your ascent is created by Maha Lakshmi power

06:30.417 --> 06:33.750
for the Kundalini to rise.

06:33.750 --> 06:38.125
In the temple of Maha Lakshmi in Kholapur

06:38.125 --> 06:42.041
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude, Ambe.”

06:42.041 --> 06:48.375
So I asked the people there, “Why do you sing Ambe’s song

06:48.417 --> 06:52.333
in Maha Lakshmi’s temple?” So they said that,

06:52.375 --> 06:59.667
“We don’t know why we do it, but is it wrong?” I said, “No,

06:59.667 --> 07:08.417
because only in the Maha Lakshmi channel Kundalini can rise

07:08.458 --> 07:15.000
and Kundalini is the Umba.” That’s how, you see, they understood

07:15.041 --> 07:19.500
and they were really amazed that I explained it very well

07:19.542 --> 07:23.375
‘cause from ancient times this song has been sung there

07:23.417 --> 07:26.375
and they never knew why this song is sung.

07:26.417 --> 07:36.583
Coming to the point of Maha Lakshmi, we have to understand

07:36.625 --> 07:48.709
what does it do, what it’s help is that this Maha Lakshmi channel or the Maha Lakshmi’s powers have created within us

07:48.750 --> 07:58.500
a proper balance, a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

07:58.542 --> 08:04.208
Left and right has been balanced and She is the one who creates

08:04.208 --> 08:13.250
and makes a wider path for Kundalini to rise.

08:13.291 --> 08:24.083
This is the path of compassion and love. Through that compassion and love

08:24.083 --> 08:30.959
She creates this path because She knows that if the path is not wide enough

08:30.959 --> 08:34.250
the Kundalini cannot rise.

08:34.291 --> 08:43.000
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking and when you start seeking,

08:43.041 --> 08:46.375
your Maha Lakshmi principle has been awakened.

08:46.375 --> 08:54.709
That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.792
I am sorry to say that many

08:56.792 --> 09:00.625
are already lost in seeking, but there are so many

09:00.625 --> 09:06.875
who have now come to the right path and to the right ascent.

09:06.917 --> 09:11.417
Another thing this Maha Lakshmi principle does

09:11.417 --> 09:18.000
is to allow the Kundalini’s power to go to different chakras also.

09:18.041 --> 09:23.417
To make a way to different chakras and corrects all the chakras.

09:23.417 --> 09:31.999
She is a very flexible force, I should say, which guides the Kundalini into different chakras

09:31.999 --> 09:37.750
and She understands which chakra needs the help of the Kundalini.

09:37.792 --> 09:42.834
So you must have seen that when the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

09:42.834 --> 09:48.542
where She goes, where She shows the need is of your awakening.

09:48.542 --> 10:00.792
All this works out because She is full of compassion and love

10:00.834 --> 10:03.999
that you should get your absolute truth.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.208
We have many problems as it is, you know, in Sahaja Yoga

10:09.250 --> 10:12.917
because when people are ascending they carry on with them

10:12.917 --> 10:19.542
some of their past stones and they cannot climb.

10:19.583 --> 10:24.750
They try then they fall, they try then they fall, then they go up again, they fall.

10:24.792 --> 10:32.500
But today I’m going to tell you about what is the state one has to achieve.

10:32.500 --> 10:41.667
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,” describes Sitha Pragya,

10:41.709 --> 10:45.792
the second chapter, but it’s very difficult to understand Him,

10:45.834 --> 10:48.250
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

10:48.291 --> 11:01.500
So people don’t understand what He is saying. And they ask the question,

11:01.500 --> 11:08.542
“How, how do you reach that state of Sitha Pragya? How do you get to that stage?”

11:08.542 --> 11:12.500
But Ganeshwara, when he wrote his “Ganeshwari,”

11:12.542 --> 11:18.458
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means the state of Sahaj.

11:18.500 --> 11:32.709
He didn’t call Sitha Pragya. He called it as Sahaja Stithi, meaning the state of Sahaj.

11:32.709 --> 11:40.333
So he describes the Sahaj in a very beautiful manner and very subtle.

11:40.375 --> 11:44.166
Of course, Ganeshwara also, very few people understand, I think.

11:44.166 --> 11:52.583
A person who reaches that state is like a mirror

11:52.583 --> 12:01.291
and so many faces pass over that mirror, so many look into that mirror,

12:01.333 --> 12:05.875
so many decorate in front of the mirror,

12:05.875 --> 12:09.625
but mirror is the same as it is.

12:09.625 --> 12:15.625
So the person who is a Sitha Pragya or the person who is Sahaja

12:15.667 --> 12:22.458
is not bothered about what is facing him,

12:22.458 --> 12:25.583
who is facing whom, where he is.

12:25.583 --> 12:31.917
He stays within himself. He contains within himself.

12:31.959 --> 12:39.875
Like the sun. If the sun plays with his different rays,

12:39.917 --> 12:46.542
he is not lost. All the rays again return to him.

12:46.542 --> 12:54.083
In the same way, all the senses that we have,

12:54.125 --> 13:04.542
all the senses that are there do play around, but for a person who is in a Sahaja state

13:04.583 --> 13:09.959
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference. He’s not involved. He just plays around.

13:09.999 --> 13:16.999
Again, all of them come back to him. This is a state you all have to achieve.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.250
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis. But I still find people

13:21.291 --> 13:23.542
lost, getting money out of Sahaja Yoga,

13:23.583 --> 13:35.000
some people lost getting out of leaderships, some are lost in getting jealousies and envies and all that. So that means

13:35.041 --> 13:38.250
a lot of work has to be done, still, within.

13:38.291 --> 13:41.583
There is no need to work as such

13:41.625 --> 13:43.458
if you leave everything.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.291
That’s why I always say meditate, because when you meditate,

13:47.333 --> 13:54.959
what happens, that all these things that are pulling you down are finished.

13:54.959 --> 14:00.667
Gradually they disappear because you become yourself.

14:00.709 --> 14:05.583
You get contained by yourself and you are never bored.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.999
I am never bored. I don’t know what boring word means, you see.

14:08.999 --> 14:12.750
When it is with you or alone, I never get bored.

14:12.792 --> 14:18.542
What is there to get bored? If you are not involved into anything you never get bored.

14:18.583 --> 14:23.959
Another thing is you rise above all these things, like greed.

14:23.999 --> 14:28.875
Now people who are greedy are still involved making money

14:28.917 --> 14:33.999
here, making money there, all that thing. Those people who are still full of lust

14:34.000 --> 14:38.417
are still making, organizing, some things like that.

14:38.458 --> 14:42.875
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just watch.

14:42.875 --> 14:51.625
You are just a witness. You are not lost into anything that is pulling you down.

14:51.625 --> 14:56.583
This state is not difficult to achieve for you, at all,

14:56.583 --> 14:59.208
because you have crossed over your mind.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.709
Now all these things come to you through your mind.

15:02.709 --> 15:08.458
I’ve already said that mind is a myth, which you must accept.

15:08.500 --> 15:14.625
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas. Some people think,

15:14.667 --> 15:22.834
“Yes Mother, but - yes Mother, but - .” This “but” is coming from your brain, from your mind.

15:22.834 --> 15:26.709
The brain is reality, but not the mind.

15:26.750 --> 15:31.625
The mind says “but” and then you start feeling very depressed sometimes,

15:31.667 --> 15:35.291
unhappy, because some people feel even bad

15:35.333 --> 15:43.583
because they are very good people, that there are so few Sahaja Yogis. Doesn’t matter. Just watch

15:43.625 --> 15:49.583
and this watching state, this witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

15:49.583 --> 15:54.542
In that you become so subtle, you become yourself,

15:54.583 --> 16:00.458
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb you, nothing can change you.

16:00.500 --> 16:07.083
Now see the nature as it is. You know there are ninety-two elements

16:07.125 --> 16:11.375
and ninety-two elements, none of them can be,

16:11.375 --> 16:19.583
say for example, you cannot make silver into gold. Gold into silver.

16:19.583 --> 16:24.792
The atoms are so arranged that

16:24.834 --> 16:28.208
they have certain valencies and apart from atom,

16:28.250 --> 16:35.208
even molecules are so arranged that they have their own structure. You cannot change.

16:35.250 --> 16:40.041
If you try to change then you will create bombs, atomic bomb, this bomb.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.709
It’s absolutely destructive.

16:42.750 --> 16:47.875
It’s only human beings who can change, who can transform.

16:47.917 --> 16:53.583
Now look at the blessings that you are a human being and you can be transformed

16:53.583 --> 16:59.667
and you can be made into a new element that is the Self.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.834
This is the specialty of human beings.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.875
But if somebody there is a false guru or somebody,

17:05.917 --> 17:09.041
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

17:09.083 --> 17:13.792
I have seen people who have been to false gurus, they still faint,

17:13.834 --> 17:22.125
they still have problems, they still get troubled more than people who have been without them.

17:22.125 --> 17:26.542
They are also all right now, most of them are improved

17:26.583 --> 17:35.208
but this is one thing one should understand, that in one way when you are analyzing

17:35.208 --> 17:41.333
and when you are breaking an atom or you are breaking a molecule and trying to transform,

17:41.375 --> 17:52.625
it explodes. It doesn’t work out. The other way round is that when you try to synthesize,

17:52.667 --> 17:56.542
then you can form anything in the nature.

17:56.583 --> 18:04.458
Like, this has now been brought out by synthesizing, this plastic is created by synthesizing.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.583
Matter can be synthesized and can be brought together

18:08.583 --> 18:15.291
Human beings have to be synthesized also

18:15.417 --> 18:23.625
They can be synthesized better than matter because they change,

18:23.667 --> 18:30.834
they transform. Now say example, there is gold. You make gold into ornaments,

18:30.875 --> 18:40.542
make into anything. It remains all the time, all the time gold. Gold is gold.

18:40.583 --> 18:49.333
It is there. It is not that by changing them into ornaments it changes. Its element is there. Gold is there.

18:49.375 --> 18:54.750
But for human beings they get transformed. When they are synthesized.

18:54.792 --> 18:59.709
This is a very big difference between the matter and the nature

18:59.750 --> 19:07.083
and human beings. Matter, nature, are different absolutely

19:07.125 --> 19:12.792
from human beings. Human beings, once they are transformed,

19:12.834 --> 19:19.834
it’s like a living process. They become like flowers

19:19.834 --> 19:28.750
but still it is not that you see in the nature. It’s not the same as you see in the nature

19:28.750 --> 19:35.291
because nature doesn’t have a mind. It doesn’t have a mind. It just is

19:35.333 --> 19:42.834
under the control of the Divine or nature that it’s working out that way.

19:42.875 --> 19:46.959
But here you are under your own control.

19:46.999 --> 19:52.291
Here you can control yourself.

19:52.333 --> 19:56.792
In this synthesis which is growing inside you

19:56.792 --> 20:01.875
what you find, that you are completely in control of yourself.

20:01.917 --> 20:05.458
You know what is happening to you.

20:05.500 --> 20:11.750
Now you start seeing yourself separating from all these things.

20:11.792 --> 20:16.709
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother, see, my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

20:16.750 --> 20:24.834
He sees his ego, he sees what is the problem is. Somebody says, “Mother, my nabhi is very bad,

20:24.834 --> 20:28.250
I’m still busy with the money.” He sees it.

20:28.250 --> 20:33.458
First starts the knowledge about yourself,

20:33.500 --> 20:40.417
we call as self-knowledge. But one has to even go beyond self-knowledge.

20:40.458 --> 20:53.250
By that knowledge, what do you do, we have to see? When you have the knowledge, first we say there’s no knowledge,

20:53.291 --> 20:56.208
people have no knowledge, they are ignorant, there’s darkness,

20:56.250 --> 21:02.750
all that. Now the light has come, you can see. You can know what’s wrong within you.

21:02.792 --> 21:09.709
Now you start separating yourself from all those things that you see as wrong with you.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.792
You see them getting out.

21:12.792 --> 21:20.709
So many nonsensical things there are. Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed and lust.

21:20.709 --> 21:24.583
I mean, it’s horrible things to say on a Diwali function, see.

21:24.625 --> 21:31.375
So the Diwali is that one by one so many lights are enlightened

21:31.417 --> 21:39.583
and you start seeing it first. First you start seeing what is wrong with you and then,

21:39.625 --> 21:46.583
as you see it, you don’t want it. Then you work out to get rid of it,

21:46.625 --> 21:49.000
to become clean.

21:49.041 --> 21:53.625
Now this also knowledge disappears.

21:53.667 --> 22:01.166
You don’t have to have any knowledge. You are there. You are there.

22:01.208 --> 22:06.333
There is no need to know about your chakras, you are just there.

22:06.375 --> 22:14.959
At that stage nothing matters. You become just like a stone,

22:14.999 --> 22:19.875
I can say. Stone with a brain intact and a heart intact

22:19.917 --> 22:26.458
and a liver intact. You just don’t mind anything, don’t get upset with anything.

22:26.500 --> 22:35.999
You just enjoy the love and compassion that’s flowing.

22:35.999 --> 22:38.834
And the ripples that come back to you,

22:38.875 --> 22:41.875
even that is lost after some time

22:41.875 --> 22:44.750
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

22:44.750 --> 22:51.500
That is the state people achieved. In those days they achieved this state.

22:51.500 --> 22:58.750
But with that, what lacking happened, that they’d get lost. They all got lost. They couldn’t do anything to others.

22:58.750 --> 23:04.458
One person getting it, becoming great, finished. Or two persons at the most.

23:04.458 --> 23:11.208
So now Sahaja Yoga stands first of all at the knowledge state,

23:11.250 --> 23:16.583
where you have the knowledge. First, you should first of all have full knowledge

23:16.583 --> 23:20.333
about yourself. The self-knowledge should be complete.

23:20.375 --> 23:25.667
Then in the third stage we should say that when the knowledge is full

23:25.709 --> 23:31.250
you should get rid of all those things that you know about yourself,

23:31.250 --> 23:34.083
which are useless, which are hampering your progress,

23:34.083 --> 23:36.250
which you know is wrong.

23:36.291 --> 23:40.667
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari, I’ll just clean it out like that.

23:40.667 --> 23:46.417
Then you start separating yourself into that Sahaja state.

23:46.458 --> 23:53.417
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop another dimension

23:53.458 --> 23:59.875
which is collective consciousness. That is the modern Sahaja Yoga.

23:59.875 --> 24:05.625
In the olden days they didn’t have this, so they just all got lost.

24:05.625 --> 24:13.959
Now you have collective consciousness and in that collective consciousness you start feeling others,

24:13.999 --> 24:21.333
feeling for others, compassion for others and you start working out for others.

24:21.375 --> 24:27.542
In that also, sometimes, you know, when you are working around, you think how much money I can make,

24:27.542 --> 24:32.709
what I can achieve as a leader or some sort of thing is still there.

24:32.750 --> 24:37.458
But this collective consciousness starts growing.

24:37.458 --> 24:45.458
When it starts growing then you become as I said, drop in the ocean, means complete ocean.

24:45.500 --> 24:54.041
You become complete ocean. So the ocean has its own mariadas.

24:54.083 --> 24:58.999
It doesn’t bother. It has to live with its mariadas, it lives with its mariadas.

24:58.999 --> 25:05.417
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries, all right. Accept it. It will not cross its boundaries.

25:05.458 --> 25:11.083
In the same way it happens that you are very self-contained.

25:11.125 --> 25:19.166
You are not selfish, but you become very self-contained. You are contained within yourself.

25:19.208 --> 25:22.750
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry

25:22.750 --> 25:25.500
that I have not punished many horrible people

25:25.542 --> 25:27.208
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.

25:27.250 --> 25:30.709
I don’t have to bother. There’s Paramchaitanya

25:30.709 --> 25:34.333
which is doing a lot of work. Let it look after it.

25:34.333 --> 25:39.417
Why should I bother about anyone? You see, after all, things are working out

25:39.458 --> 25:49.792
so why to interfere? My job is just to watch, just to see.

25:49.834 --> 25:56.625
That’s sufficient. There’s no need for Me to kill anybody

25:56.667 --> 26:01.041
in this lifetime or to destroy. They are destroyed by themselves.

26:01.083 --> 26:05.583
I have told you that I need not expose people,

26:05.625 --> 26:09.834
but whichever country I go, I find people get exposed.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.458
I run away from there, really, sometimes, thinking,

26:12.500 --> 26:14.750
God knows what more is going to come.

26:14.792 --> 26:18.041
Even little attention on any country,

26:18.041 --> 26:23.792
it just works out. Even without My knowledge,

26:23.834 --> 26:26.041
“Oh My God,” I said, “When did I do that?”

26:26.041 --> 26:36.083
So one has to become, of course, he becomes the power of Divine love, no doubt.

26:36.125 --> 26:43.999
He becomes the power of Divine love, but he doesn’t handle it. Left to this Divine power

26:43.999 --> 26:47.709
which is working, which is also separated from Me,

26:47.750 --> 26:52.375
you’ll be surprised. I am alone. Absolutely alone.

26:52.417 --> 26:58.083
Even this power is separated from Me, but this power knows

26:58.083 --> 27:02.709
what is good for human beings, what is good for Sahaja Yoga.

27:02.709 --> 27:07.458
It works on it’s own. I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex action,

27:07.458 --> 27:11.000
believe Me, it’s a reflex action. Maybe you might say,

27:11.041 --> 27:17.041
“Mother, you have made it.” All right, whatever it is, but I don’t interfere with it.

27:17.041 --> 27:23.083
I don’t have to tell anything to it. It just works and it’s working so well.

27:23.125 --> 27:27.500
I’ll give you an example. Once in England long time back, they said,

27:27.500 --> 27:29.583
“Mother, we want to have a very long summer.” I said,

27:29.625 --> 27:31.999
“Why do you want to ask such things?” “No, no, Mother,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.250
we must have a long summer, a very long summer, very - “

27:34.291 --> 27:41.208
Three or four times they said it and it was a very long, horrible summer in London.

27:41.208 --> 27:46.959
And it’s not like India where we have air conditioning, fans,

27:46.999 --> 27:51.250
something we have, at least hand fans. There was nothing there.

27:51.291 --> 27:55.208
So we didn’t know. We had a little gallery, we used to sleep in that.

27:55.250 --> 28:04.208
So we went to the shop in England and we asked in London City, for a fan. So they said,

28:04.208 --> 28:08.667
“All right, after three months. You order us.” After three months

28:08.709 --> 28:13.458
when it will be very cold they will give us the fan. We said, “We don’t want any fans.”

28:13.458 --> 28:17.500
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

28:17.542 --> 28:20.792
And that’s how we managed. You see, Indians, we feel very hot

28:20.834 --> 28:23.750
because we have had a lot of sun in our country,

28:23.792 --> 28:25.875
we feel much hotter than any one of you.

28:25.875 --> 28:30.750
The way you sit in the sun, you know, we can’t understand. You know, in India they used to say

28:30.792 --> 28:34.709
an Englishman and a mad dog can only go in the sun.

28:34.750 --> 28:41.041
So our situation is like that, that we cannot go in the sun

28:41.083 --> 28:43.000
because we have had too much.

28:43.041 --> 28:49.792
And this summer, you see, was so tremendous, so tremendous that after that one thing good happened.

28:49.834 --> 28:56.333
That ochre color appeared on the leaves and then gradually the red

28:56.375 --> 29:00.750
and all that of the autumn season was best at that time

29:00.750 --> 29:05.375
and then one Sahaja Yogi dreamt that, “Mother asked me

29:05.417 --> 29:07.875
to drive in Her back yard.”

29:07.917 --> 29:13.750
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been asking me to drive in the back yard.”

29:13.750 --> 29:17.667
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t know he had dreamt like that, that,

29:17.709 --> 29:23.709
“Can you come along for a while, I want to go and see this autumn all over England.”

29:23.750 --> 29:27.417
So he came and we were driving, miles together

29:27.458 --> 29:32.583
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was so, he told us that that was My back yard.”

29:32.625 --> 29:35.750
Can you imagine that he was driving for miles together,

29:35.750 --> 29:37.917
beautiful, just like Canada,

29:37.917 --> 29:42.333
the whole England was filled with the beauty of autumn.

29:42.375 --> 29:48.000
So even if there’s something like that happens, it is compensated.

29:48.041 --> 29:54.166
It is compensated and so beautiful it was, all the people were out in the autumn

29:54.208 --> 29:57.041
to see the beautiful colors of the nature,

29:57.083 --> 30:03.417
of different greenery, yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were there.

30:03.458 --> 30:07.041
Surprisingly, in that country you never see all that.

30:07.083 --> 30:12.750
And because of the sun shining so bright, it was compensated.

30:12.792 --> 30:18.333
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya. So the Paramchaitanya

30:18.375 --> 30:29.208
is looking after this. All these things are managed by Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing. I am Nishkriya.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.625
I’m just sitting down and watching.

30:31.625 --> 30:36.291
To Me nothing matters. You see, it’s working out slowly and steadily.

30:36.333 --> 30:40.417
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing, they said, “Mother, we prayed to You

30:40.458 --> 30:42.709
and it happened.” All right, maybe,

30:42.750 --> 30:47.709
these people must have heard, around Me, Not me, you see,

30:47.750 --> 30:54.417
and they must have done the job and for that I’m not responsible, in no way.

30:54.458 --> 30:58.041
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was very sick

30:58.041 --> 31:02.333
and was about to die. She wrote a letter to Me, three letters

31:02.333 --> 31:05.333
she wrote that, “My son is going to die, he’s a young fellow,

31:05.375 --> 31:09.750
studying in Harvard.” I didn’t do anything.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.999
I never wrote to her. Fourth letter came

31:11.999 --> 31:14.166
that he’s completely cured.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.959
Now I didn’t do that because I was just sitting in one place

31:16.959 --> 31:19.291
and how is it, it has worked out.

31:19.333 --> 31:22.583
So everything, you see, you think I do

31:22.583 --> 31:26.041
is not done by Me. Is done by this Paramchaitanya.

31:26.083 --> 31:30.959
Because I’m also separated from you, completely, absolutely separated.

31:30.959 --> 31:35.999
So they say, “You pray, now.” You can pray. If you pray, you pray to these deities

31:36.000 --> 31:40.250
that are around, you pray to all these ganas and all that, not to Me.

31:40.291 --> 31:45.333
Because I have nothing to do with it. You see, they don’t tell Me

31:45.375 --> 31:48.417
that I have to do this or I have to do that, so why should I tell them

31:48.458 --> 31:52.875
do this or do that? It is like that. And in that state only

31:52.917 --> 31:55.166
we can say you are in a Sahaja state,

31:55.208 --> 31:58.375
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t want anything.

31:58.417 --> 32:03.959
I do everything. All kinds of things, I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

32:03.959 --> 32:11.875
I am also doing in the sense that I’m looking after things, flowers, this that.

32:11.875 --> 32:20.500
I am also receiving presents from you, I’m receiving this from you and then see, I don’t receive anything.

32:20.500 --> 32:25.000
I don’t have anything. I have no interest in it.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.166
But you want to give for your joy, all right,

32:28.166 --> 32:31.667
have it. You want to put flowers, all right, you can have flowers.

32:31.709 --> 32:37.291
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

32:37.333 --> 32:43.333
But as Your Mother I love you. All of you I love.

32:43.333 --> 32:46.834
But I don’t do anything as such to love you. And everybody says,

32:46.834 --> 32:48.834
“Mother, You love us so much.” When?

32:48.875 --> 32:51.458
When did I love you. I never even kissed you.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.083
But you always say I love you very much. So

32:54.125 --> 32:57.458
what is this. Who is working it out, this?

32:57.458 --> 33:02.875
Is something which is not Me, beyond Me. This is the state in which,

33:02.875 --> 33:05.917
once we rise, we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

33:05.917 --> 33:09.375
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are doing nothing.

33:09.417 --> 33:11.333
Everything is working out.

33:11.375 --> 33:14.041
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,

33:14.083 --> 33:15.750
“Oh, we are not doing anything.

33:15.792 --> 33:19.333
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga, it’s not our job?”

33:19.333 --> 33:26.750
Just now, that’s not your stithi, that’s why. So you have to rise up

33:26.792 --> 33:28.834
to that state. That’s only possible

33:28.875 --> 33:36.792
when you are in the knowledge state, where you have self-knowledge, the knowledge of the whole world.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.750
But if you go beyond knowledge

33:38.750 --> 33:41.792
then you must have seen many a times, I just say something.

33:41.792 --> 33:49.125
I just say something and it is there. I never feel vibrations of anyone

33:49.166 --> 33:53.208
or anything. I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor any chakras, nothing,

33:53.250 --> 33:55.959
but I know, know automatically

33:55.999 --> 33:59.000
like a computer. But that computer also I am not.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.166
Just it’s trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

34:02.166 --> 34:07.166
what is this stithi is because you have to achieve it. Once you achieve it

34:07.208 --> 34:11.959
then you are in a very subtle state and that subtle state

34:11.999 --> 34:17.875
is nothing but bliss. But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

34:17.917 --> 34:22.917
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.

34:22.959 --> 34:26.542
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

34:26.583 --> 34:29.166
I forget even you are calling Me.

34:29.166 --> 34:32.583
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

34:32.625 --> 34:38.166
See it is such a simple thing one has to understand

34:38.208 --> 34:41.625
that the state in which one has to rise

34:41.667 --> 34:48.083
is a state where without doing anything, everything works out. If that is your state, all right.

34:48.125 --> 34:52.208
But it’s not so. So you have to rise up to that state

34:52.250 --> 34:56.500
by doing. First you have to do it. First you have to know

34:56.542 --> 35:01.875
and then knowledge has no need, you don’t have to know,

35:01.917 --> 35:05.792
but first that has to be worked out and brought to that level.

35:05.792 --> 35:13.208
Now Diwali has the significance that on Diwali day, what we do, we put lights all over.

35:13.208 --> 35:18.375
So that we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

35:18.417 --> 35:29.917
But does the light know about itself? Does the candle knows about itself?

35:29.959 --> 35:34.125
She enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

35:34.125 --> 35:44.166
Like the moon, which is giving moonlight, does it know itself?

35:44.166 --> 35:55.333
Does he enjoy? Nothing. In the same way it happens that on a Diwali day

35:55.333 --> 35:59.458
you are, what you are doing is enlightening people, you are enlightening them,

35:59.458 --> 36:04.208
you are doing all this for them, it’s a good idea. You must do it.

36:04.250 --> 36:08.375
But also know that you have to become the lamp yourself

36:08.417 --> 36:11.333
which doesn’t know yourself.

36:11.333 --> 36:16.208
So there are two messages. The first one is

36:16.208 --> 36:19.999
that we have to enlighten the world, we have to enlighten others.

36:19.999 --> 36:21.959
This is the first one. Then

36:21.959 --> 36:29.208
we have to become that which is the light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

36:29.250 --> 36:32.959
Yesterday you were singing, “You are the light,” you are this thing.

36:32.999 --> 36:39.041
All right, so what? I was just saying, ‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

36:39.041 --> 36:44.583
That’s the state where you don’t know you are the light.

36:44.583 --> 36:47.750
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come into your head.

36:47.750 --> 36:51.750
Even so many times you have sung, you have said thousand names there are,

36:51.792 --> 36:56.583
everything, but it doesn’t come into My head that this is Me you are talking about.

36:56.625 --> 37:02.500
Now when I say this I don’t know how you will react.

37:02.500 --> 37:05.583
Because human beings are queer birds, you see.

37:05.625 --> 37:10.625
You tell them something. Maybe that your ego might come up and you say,

37:10.667 --> 37:13.000
“Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

37:13.000 --> 37:16.750
There are many, many who came like that, that,

37:16.750 --> 37:18.375
“I am higher than Mataji.”

37:18.417 --> 37:22.125
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There are many who said that,

37:22.166 --> 37:29.834
“I am Kalki.” Nowadays there’s one fellow going round saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

37:29.834 --> 37:34.875
All right doesn’t matter. You be that, very good idea.

37:34.917 --> 37:50.709
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means

37:50.709 --> 37:54.999
I don’t know what I am, really. I had to say

37:55.000 --> 37:57.417
because people said, “Mother, you have to declare.”

37:57.458 --> 38:02.375
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am. Now I find

38:02.417 --> 38:07.333
by declaration you people started growing more,

38:07.375 --> 38:09.583
so all right, have it that way.

38:09.583 --> 38:15.166
But there is no need for anyone to declare anything or to say anything.

38:15.208 --> 38:18.542
That is the state one has to achieve.

38:18.542 --> 38:22.583
But to get to that state you have to work.

38:22.625 --> 38:27.792
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have to enlighten many lights.

38:27.834 --> 38:32.333
That means you will realize that you are the light

38:32.333 --> 38:34.625
which is enlightening all that,

38:34.625 --> 38:40.208
and then in a subtle way you will realize that, “I am the light.”

38:40.250 --> 38:43.333
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing a lot of work

38:43.375 --> 38:46.458
and working it out, spreading Sahaja Yoga.

38:46.458 --> 38:51.625
It’s a very great thing that has happened. In so many countries,

38:51.625 --> 38:58.959
the way it has spread, it has removed the darkness of religion which was outside.

38:58.959 --> 39:05.875
It was darkness of so many - racialism, thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

39:05.875 --> 39:14.458
So this has worked out, the cleansing. For you to have the clean water to swim.

39:14.458 --> 39:21.000
Once you start doing that then you realize gradually

39:21.041 --> 39:26.333
that now the sea is clean, we just watch,

39:26.333 --> 39:32.667
we just see how it is working. I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve this state

39:32.709 --> 39:41.000
where you achieve your complete work of self-realization to others.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.583
Those who do not give self-realization to others,

39:43.583 --> 39:47.542
who just come for the pujas, this thing, are mediocres.

39:47.583 --> 39:50.333
They cannot rise very high.

39:50.333 --> 39:53.542
This coming to puja is what, like, you just rise higher with the puja

39:53.583 --> 39:57.583
then again you go down. But those who steadily grow

39:57.625 --> 40:01.166
will grow into this state, I am sure, in My lifetime

40:01.208 --> 40:08.125
I should be able to see such people who are such that if they stand here they emit peace,

40:08.166 --> 40:13.500
they emit light, they emit everything. Because they are the light. They don’t have to enlighten,

40:13.542 --> 40:18.417
but they are the light. Such a stage has to be developed

40:18.458 --> 40:20.959
and to be worked out within yourself.

40:20.999 --> 40:26.917
And this state has been described by so many poets, so many saints and everything,

40:26.917 --> 40:29.834
but they were at that stage and people thought,

40:29.875 --> 40:32.375
what is this they are talking? They thought they were mad.

40:32.417 --> 40:36.583
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be crucified, because they couldn’t understand it.

40:36.625 --> 40:40.999
Now you are gradually growing one by one, step by step,

40:40.999 --> 40:46.166
so now you understand this. You understand Christ, you understand all these people

40:46.208 --> 40:50.333
and at this stage you have still to work.

40:50.333 --> 40:54.542
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga cannot rise higher.

40:54.583 --> 41:01.000
You have to work for Sahaja Yoga, you have to spread it more, you have to work it out,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.542
enjoy each other, this brotherhood, everything.

41:04.583 --> 41:11.500
All the qualities of a beautiful personality should be there.

41:11.500 --> 41:19.583
Unless and until you achieve that state, then you can only rise higher

41:19.583 --> 41:22.667
to that stage which I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi.

41:22.709 --> 41:25.250
In that state you will be perfect.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.834
But you must get rid of all these things

41:27.875 --> 41:34.166
and today is a day, also of Maha Lakshmi. The first thing is, I think,

41:34.208 --> 41:38.542
this madness about money. This should be understood

41:38.583 --> 41:43.000
that it’s real madness. Those who are rich have no money.

41:43.041 --> 41:44.917
You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

41:44.917 --> 41:48.792
“Oh, I have no money.” Why? What is all this? This is no money.

41:48.834 --> 41:51.333
You ask the poor man, he has no money.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.083
A rich man has no money.

41:53.125 --> 41:59.333
So it’s a kind of a greed which is never satisfied,

41:59.375 --> 42:05.208
which never helps you. All these little, little things have to first drop out.

42:05.208 --> 42:08.375
Then your work should cleanse you. In your work

42:08.375 --> 42:10.999
you will know whether you are cleansing or not.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.709
In the work you will know how you are doing your work.

42:13.750 --> 42:17.583
Once that is done, then I think

42:17.625 --> 42:20.583
I am sure some of you will achieve that state

42:20.625 --> 42:27.083
in My lifetime, in your lifetime. That’s what I want today to tell you, on a Diwali day,

42:27.125 --> 42:31.583
that we have to become subtler and subtler and subtler.

42:31.625 --> 42:35.041
We should not be influenced by outside things.

42:35.041 --> 42:41.959
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort of a fashion starts.

42:41.999 --> 42:49.999
People who follow fashions are stupid. They are like blind mices.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.999
Anybody can lead them into anything,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.375
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

42:54.417 --> 43:02.000
So if you try to follow any kind of a thought which is given to us by somebody else,

43:02.000 --> 43:06.291
in that thought you’ll completely lose yourself

43:06.333 --> 43:09.999
and you’ll become, “I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu, I am Muslim.”

43:19.000 --> 43:25.875
And when you become the Spirit then you start knowing so much

43:25.875 --> 43:28.875
and this knowledge is very important.

43:28.917 --> 43:34.333
This is the gap between a saint and a normal human being,

43:34.375 --> 43:36.999
which you have crossed gradually

43:36.999 --> 43:40.166
so you know what are the problems of the human beings are

43:40.208 --> 43:44.291
and dealing with human beings, you know how to deal with them.

43:44.291 --> 43:48.250
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective consciousness,

43:48.291 --> 43:50.458
in modern times, has come.

43:50.500 --> 43:54.125
This collective consciousness, also the saints had,

43:54.125 --> 44:01.125
but they would not say. They would not say anything. They would not bother.

44:01.166 --> 44:03.417
All right, this fellow has this chakra,

44:03.458 --> 44:06.041
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

44:06.083 --> 44:09.291
It’s not a question of not caring, but not bothered.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.375
They were sitting in a state which

44:11.417 --> 44:14.667
was just recording, all right.

44:14.709 --> 44:21.667
An ugly man goes before the mirror, all right, if a beautiful person goes before the mirror is all right.

44:21.709 --> 44:28.834
In the same way these people start allowing people to pass through

44:28.875 --> 44:32.041
but we have to understand, still we have to grow.

44:32.083 --> 44:37.917
We have to still grow by working it out. Those people who are working it out

44:37.917 --> 44:47.709
and spreading it all over are the ones which are really very much there

44:47.750 --> 44:56.834
and to them, I must say, the Paramchaitanya is just their servant.

44:56.875 --> 45:02.250
I have seen people who desire something, it works out.

45:02.250 --> 45:07.917
They ask for something, it works out. For that, now,

45:07.917 --> 45:09.959
what should we have, is the point.

45:09.959 --> 45:14.417
After getting realization, after getting everything,

45:14.458 --> 45:20.375
what should we have that we develop is the faith. Faith in yourself.

45:20.417 --> 45:29.999
Faith in that you are the Spirit, that you have the light

45:30.000 --> 45:32.667
and you have to enlighten others.

45:32.709 --> 45:41.125
This faith when it grows deeper and deeper then you think,

45:41.166 --> 45:46.083
oh, what I am. I am the Spirit.

45:46.083 --> 45:50.792
If you are the Spirit then this whole nature is with you.

45:50.834 --> 45:58.208
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them was a fisherman.

45:58.208 --> 46:02.834
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has tremendous faith in Me

46:02.834 --> 46:09.542
and somehow he was going to another village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

46:09.583 --> 46:16.917
When he came out of his little hut he found it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

46:16.917 --> 46:21.291
So he raised his hand and said, “See now, I’m going for Mother’s work.

46:21.333 --> 46:23.917
And you dare not start raining.

46:23.917 --> 46:28.875
You keep as you are, hanging there till I finish my work,” you see.

46:28.917 --> 46:31.291
Because he was going by boat.

46:31.333 --> 46:34.417
And other Sahaja Yogis thought, “What is he talking about?”

46:34.417 --> 46:38.083
They all got into the boat, they reached the other village.

46:38.083 --> 46:42.083
They gave realization to others, he finished his lecturing, everything,

46:42.125 --> 46:45.250
he came back on the shore and he entered his house.

46:45.291 --> 46:46.083
When he was closing the door,

46:46.125 --> 46:50.750
“All right, so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

46:50.792 --> 46:56.041
So the complete faith that this Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

46:56.083 --> 46:59.667
is all the time waiting there to serve you.

46:59.667 --> 47:02.083
Whatever you say will happen.

47:02.083 --> 47:06.083
But first you must have complete faith in yourself

47:06.083 --> 47:07.999
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

47:07.999 --> 47:12.000
Even now I find, you see, people have some lust,

47:12.041 --> 47:15.709
some sort of a horrible things in them.

47:15.750 --> 47:19.291
So first you must be established in Dharma.

47:19.333 --> 47:24.834
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness. If you are in the righteousness,

47:24.875 --> 47:29.792
there’s no question. There’s no question that this Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

47:29.834 --> 47:34.834
But supposing you want today something and it doesn’t work out,

47:34.875 --> 47:39.125
then even to get disappointed itself is not a very good thing.

47:39.125 --> 47:48.583
Disappointment also is a sign of your immaturity.

47:48.625 --> 47:50.667
What is there to be disappointed?

47:50.709 --> 47:57.208
Maybe that that was good for you.

47:57.208 --> 48:02.959
Supposing I lose My way. I’m going this way and I lose My way,

48:02.999 --> 48:07.041
I don’t know where to go. So I get lost, it’s all right. What is there? Wherever I am,

48:07.083 --> 48:10.667
I am there. How can I be lost to Myself.

48:10.667 --> 48:14.208
And then what I find, that I had to go that way

48:14.250 --> 48:18.542
because I was to meet somebody, I’ve been wanting to meet somebody

48:18.542 --> 48:24.792
and meet that person there. Can you imagine? Such things happen with Me,

48:24.834 --> 48:26.917
and even if I don’t meet, so what?

48:26.917 --> 48:30.917
I was to go that side. I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.

48:30.959 --> 48:35.834
It’s like that. So once you know that whatever you are doing

48:35.834 --> 48:40.959
in command, full command, full faith,

48:40.999 --> 48:45.417
actually the whole authority comes to you

48:45.458 --> 48:49.375
through your faith which word is satta in Sanskrit,

48:49.375 --> 48:51.291
meaning the truth. The truth gives you the authority.

48:51.333 --> 49:00.083
Now another thing which is important is the faith in your guru.

49:00.083 --> 49:07.375
If you have faith in your guru, Paramchaitanya is kind

49:07.417 --> 49:10.875
to you. It’s very helpful. But if you doubt,

49:10.875 --> 49:14.291
then Paramchaitanya also doubts you

49:14.333 --> 49:18.291
because Paramchaitanya knows you through your guru,

49:18.291 --> 49:21.750
whether it is Me or any other real guru, it’s the same.

49:21.792 --> 49:25.999
But with Me, of course, because, you know,

49:25.999 --> 49:27.458
I’m very forgiving so people

49:27.500 --> 49:29.999
start taking liberties.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.792
With another guru, you see, he will beat them.

49:32.834 --> 49:38.041
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things to you if you are not there.

49:38.041 --> 49:40.750
So I’ve told you many stories about the gurus,

49:40.792 --> 49:43.625
how they treat - good gurus - their disciples.

49:43.667 --> 49:47.291
But I forgive. I don’t say anything. Let it be, it doesn’t matter.

49:47.333 --> 49:50.583
Because I think by leaving them alone only,

49:50.583 --> 49:53.291
they will rise and they will come up to this stage.

49:53.291 --> 49:58.083
But it happens sometimes that it may work the other way round,

49:58.125 --> 50:05.041
that if they are forgiven, then they take it for granted.

50:05.041 --> 50:08.959
All rigth , there is freedom, you can take it for granted

50:18.417 --> 50:19.792
So the faith in yourself is with patience you watch

50:19.834 --> 50:24.125
and do not get disappointed with anything whatsoever.

50:24.166 --> 50:29.625
Now, just imagine so many people have got realization, so many saints in this world,

50:29.667 --> 50:35.458
have you seen? Yesterday I was surprised the way the French were singing so well.

50:35.458 --> 50:40.375
You know, first time I had to take a harmonium to teach them how to sing one line

50:40.375 --> 50:44.792
Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

50:44.834 --> 50:48.959
The same French have reached

50:50.417 --> 50:52.333
that state of creativity. You see,

50:52.333 --> 50:56.208
all your potential will rise. It will express itself,

50:56.250 --> 51:00.500
but be careful not to get into ego about it.

51:00.542 --> 51:07.583
Gradually it will flower and others who are surrounding you will get the fragrance of it

51:07.583 --> 51:13.999
and they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga. That is the blessing at that time, the blessing of the real Divine

51:13.999 --> 51:18.458
will be that you’ll be raised to the state which we call as a perfect,

51:18.500 --> 51:25.291
‘purnattwa’, complete. That completeness will come. But you judge yourself.

51:25.333 --> 51:34.375
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj? Are you absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

51:34.375 --> 51:37.959
Or other things are more important to you than Sahaja Yoga?

51:37.999 --> 51:43.291
Then, go ahead.

51:43.333 --> 51:49.667
There is something to be understood very clearly that there’s no competition

51:49.709 --> 51:53.291
in Sahaja Yoga. Cannot be. There’s no competition.

51:53.333 --> 52:01.625
There’s no envy, there is no back biting, nothing. It is, you are different people. You are saints.

52:01.792 --> 52:07.083
Your style is different. You are absolutely above

52:07.083 --> 52:10.125
all these things. You cannot be dishonest,

52:10.166 --> 52:14.750
you cannot cheat people, you cannot do this. And if you are doing that,

52:14.792 --> 52:21.500
even now, then please try to understand that you have still to grow into it.

52:21.500 --> 52:23.834
Some big people think

52:23.834 --> 52:30.542
they are very high up in Sahaja Yoga. It’s not so, it’s not so.

52:30.583 --> 52:36.750
If by thinking what you are, then you are lost.

52:36.792 --> 52:42.542
What you have to do is to understand “What have I done?

52:42.542 --> 52:45.583
How many people have I given realization,

52:45.583 --> 52:48.208
to how many people have talked about it?”

52:48.250 --> 52:51.500
People are shy, even, to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

52:51.542 --> 52:54.375
I have seen one lady was traveling with Me. Very hot.

52:54.375 --> 53:01.959
I said, “Ba, ba who is she, this one? I don’t know.” So she told Me the name of her guru. She said, “My guru is like this, guru like that, like that.”

53:01.999 --> 53:06.750
I said, “My God, this heat coming out of this woman and she’s talking so much.”

53:06.750 --> 53:11.208
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody what is Sahaja Yoga.

53:11.250 --> 53:16.542
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends but they will never

53:16.583 --> 53:20.041
tell them what Sahaja Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

53:20.041 --> 53:24.333
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties, you see, if the others are drinking they’ll say,

53:24.333 --> 53:27.250
“All right, I don’t drink.” But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

53:27.291 --> 53:31.542
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.” They will not say that.

53:31.542 --> 53:38.291
So this is the third point, one has to know the announcement.

53:38.291 --> 53:42.500
You must have faith in yourself and you must announce.

53:42.542 --> 53:45.041
All the saints announced.

53:45.041 --> 53:49.792
They were killed for that, you saw how Socrates was given poison.

53:49.792 --> 53:53.417
Doesn’t matter. Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these modern times,

53:53.458 --> 53:58.208
there’s fundamental rights to exist. So nobody can kill you, take it from Me,

53:58.250 --> 54:03.125
but you must announce. And the announcement should be with full faith

54:03.125 --> 54:07.500
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga, how important it is.

54:07.542 --> 54:13.417
The purpose is to transform the whole world.

54:13.458 --> 54:17.709
With your transformation the whole world transforms.

54:17.709 --> 54:22.875
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise, Sahaja Yoga

54:22.917 --> 54:26.041
is extremely complicated because how it works.

54:26.083 --> 54:31.625
The other day, you remember, the mike had failed completely

54:31.667 --> 54:36.041
and I was giving the lecture and still I was talking.

54:36.083 --> 54:40.542
The mike had failed but everybody was listening to Me.

54:40.542 --> 54:45.959
What had happened? Did I enter into the ether? What happened? I don’t know.

54:45.999 --> 54:50.583
I didn’t even know that mike had failed. I was thinking there is mike,

54:50.625 --> 54:54.999
that the way people were listening to Me,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.041
but then they told that half lecture was without the mike.

54:58.083 --> 55:02.583
And everybody was absolutely listening to Me.

55:02.625 --> 55:15.000
You see, it is something that one has to wonder and appreciate

55:15.041 --> 55:18.291
what things are happening now, where are we going.

55:20.291 --> 55:21.500
We are going into the Kingdom of God

55:21.500 --> 55:26.500
and all the blessings, all the bliss will be on you.

55:26.542 --> 55:34.166
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything becomes one, nothing but bliss

55:34.208 --> 55:39.709
and you are in that state of bliss which you don’t even know,

55:39.709 --> 55:44.959
you are just there. The greatest bliss is that you don’t know even anything,

55:44.959 --> 55:47.583
you’re just there.

55:47.625 --> 55:50.458
I hope all of you achieve that state

55:50.500 --> 55:53.291
with this Diwali being done in Portugal,

55:53.291 --> 55:58.333
which is a special place, I think, of Maha Lakshmi because She appeared here

55:58.333 --> 56:01.583
as they say and also this swayambu that we have,

56:01.583 --> 56:05.375
also is that of Maha Lakshmi face, so I’m sure

56:05.417 --> 56:07.500
it will work out for all of you.

56:07.500 --> 56:10.542
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking about

56:10.583 --> 56:17.375
but it is, I have to tell you, that one has to rise up to that state

56:17.417 --> 56:22.583
and that state is very, very easy to achieve for you.

56:22.583 --> 56:26.667
It slowly, gradually it - then you don’t have to do anything,

56:26.667 --> 56:29.208
you go into a village and everything would be there.

56:29.250 --> 56:31.375
See, now, what happened. I went to Cairo.

56:31.375 --> 56:34.583
Everybody was saluting Me. I was wondering,

56:34.583 --> 56:37.500
what has happened to them? I went to Leningrad,

56:37.500 --> 56:39.625
thousands came to My program. I asked them,

56:39.625 --> 56:41.542
“How did you come to My program?” They said,

56:41.583 --> 56:48.166
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s obvious.” They just saw a small, little advertisement in the newspaper,

56:48.208 --> 56:50.542
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.”

56:50.583 --> 56:54.959
That should happen. And then you can announce

56:54.999 --> 56:58.500
that Sahaja Yoga is the only way, then you can announce.

56:58.542 --> 57:03.959
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to say something to their friends and things.

57:03.999 --> 57:08.333
And you must know that all of those who you love, who you know,

57:08.375 --> 57:11.999
will go to hell or where - they’ll hang in the limbo or what?

57:12.000 --> 57:15.083
If you have achieved it you should pull them out also.

57:15.125 --> 57:19.041
They may not. They may not be seekers, doesn’t matter now.

57:19.083 --> 57:21.625
I think we are finished with the seekers now,

57:21.667 --> 57:23.417
must be - we must have people

57:23.458 --> 57:26.917
who are not so seeking, it looks like that.

57:26.959 --> 57:30.375
So may God bless you all
