00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.760
You hold your breath three times.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.063
And think in your heart that I am the mother of the universe

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:17.890
That’s all! This will… This has to be corrected

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.239
That’s a problem there, that’s why.

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.824
Unless and until you correct this problem, the attention,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.530
but not only attention but kundalini goes there.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.495
So you have to correct that thing.

00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:29.941
Which I noticed yesterday: you have a center heart

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:33.523
But you have come to SY now I mean a few days back

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:36.016
You’ll get corrected in no time. Alright?

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:44.628
They have to put your right hand towards the photograph,

00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:46.722
the left hand here

00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:54.680
And you have to hold your breath. All of you can do it.

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:57.901
Hold your breath

00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:01.925
And say: Jagadamba, Jagadamba, Jagadamba.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.122
You are holding the breath; so how can you say?

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:09.235
You have to think.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.550
Now leave it.

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.497
And then hold it once more.

00:01:25.137 --> 00:01:29.520
Put your left hand. Right hand towards Me.

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:35.860
Good. Now leave it.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.728
Again hold it.

00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:53.536
Now leave it. Alright?

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.842
May God bless you.
