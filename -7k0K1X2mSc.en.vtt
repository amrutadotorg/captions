00:08.274 --> 00:10.760
You hold your breath three times.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.063
And think in your heart that I am the mother of the universe

00:15.144 --> 00:17.890
That’s all! This will… This has to be corrected

00:17.890 --> 00:20.239
That’s a problem there, that’s why.

00:20.239 --> 00:22.824
Unless and until you correct this problem, the attention,

00:22.905 --> 00:25.530
but not only attention but kundalini goes there.

00:25.530 --> 00:27.495
So you have to correct that thing.

00:27.576 --> 00:29.941
Which I noticed yesterday: you have a center heart

00:30.022 --> 00:33.523
But you have come to SY now I mean a few days back

00:33.604 --> 00:36.016
You’ll get corrected in no time. Alright?

00:36.137 --> 00:44.628
They have to put your right hand towards the photograph,

00:44.732 --> 00:46.722
the left hand here

00:49.453 --> 00:54.680
And you have to hold your breath. All of you can do it.

00:55.303 --> 00:57.901
Hold your breath

00:58.311 --> 01:01.925
And say: Jagadamba, Jagadamba, Jagadamba.

01:02.006 --> 01:06.122
You are holding the breath; so how can you say?

01:06.203 --> 01:09.235
You have to think.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.550
Now leave it.

01:21.698 --> 01:24.497
And then hold it once more.

01:25.137 --> 01:29.520
Put your left hand. Right hand towards Me.

01:31.872 --> 01:35.860
Good. Now leave it.

01:38.470 --> 01:41.728
Again hold it.

01:49.117 --> 01:53.536
Now leave it. Alright?

01:55.159 --> 01:56.842
May God bless you.
