1
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:35,821
Last night was a night of complete darkness,
that they call it as amavasya; and just now

2
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:41,302
only the first phase of the moon has started.

3
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:56,362
Today we are here to celebrate the day when
the Sahastrara was opened out.

4
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:01,441
Also you have seen in the photograph.

5
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:10,242
It was actually a photograph of my brain,
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened

6
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:11,292
out.

7
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:16,272
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

8
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:20,811
It’s something great these modern times
have done.

9
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:26,742
So the modern times have brought a lot of
things which can prove the existence of the

10
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,732
Divine.

11
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:36,292
Also it can prove about me.

12
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:41,892
It can convince you what I am.

13
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:53,262
This is very important because, in the modern
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

14
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:54,592
to be fully recognised.

15
00:01:54,592 --> 00:02:00,102
This is one of the conditions for all the
Sahaja Yogis.

16
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:10,152
Now let’s see what’s happening in the
modern times, in the brains of the people.

17
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:20,262
In the brains of the people today, if you
see, there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

18
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:27,902
There has been an attack since long but in
the modern times it’s the worst time.

19
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:42,152
They are trying to make the limbic area very
insensitive.

20
00:02:42,152 --> 00:03:00,672
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts
and very depressive music, you can say, like

21
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,782
Greek tragedy nonsense.

22
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:21,821
All these things came from the medieval period
till, we should say, this new age has started.

23
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:26,692
That one itself was no good for our limbic
area.

24
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:29,961
That made us very depressive.

25
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:43,252
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called
miseries.

26
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:57,782
But then came this modern age in which people
became overactive – over-activity started.

27
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:06,142
With that the brain also became overactive.

28
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:15,702
In addition to the dullness before, it’s
gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

29
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:26,661
So to dull it again they took to drugs, they
took to very horrible music.

30
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:34,722
That’s how they made this limbic area very,
very insensitive.

31
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:47,312
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin
with was to be taken in greater quantity and

32
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:56,611
later on they had to take the drugs which
were of a much more severe nature.

33
00:04:56,611 --> 00:05:03,212
It went on like that and now we know that
this drug is the only way people think they

34
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:06,372
can survive.

35
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,111
Why?

36
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:11,351
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

37
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:15,492
In the modern times we have something called
‘tensions’.

38
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,062
It was never there before.

39
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,342
People never talked of their tensions.

40
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:22,382
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!”

41
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,582
“You give me a tension!”

42
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:27,142
What is this tension?

43
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:31,602
It’s because of my advent.

44
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:40,141
The limbic area wants to know about me.

45
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:49,623
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is
increasing, is trying to rise in people; because

46
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:51,861
you become the channels.

47
00:05:51,861 --> 00:06:05,632
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations,
and these vibrations give a challenge to the

48
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:12,641
Kundalini, or a message, and in various people
it rises.

49
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:18,861
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara, or it
may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls

50
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:22,641
back, because there’s no recognition.

51
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:29,611
So every time they do something, this Kundalini
comes up and gives them a pressure, because

52
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:35,351
their Sahastrara is not open.

53
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,791
It’s a closed door.

54
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:43,201
Because of the closed door this gives them
a kind of a pressure in the head, which they

55
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:47,872
don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

56
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:55,522
Actually the Kundalini is trying to push it
out, itself, but it cannot.

57
00:06:55,522 --> 00:07:04,161
And those also who get their Realisation,
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

58
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,671
they go on getting into tensions.

59
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:22,821
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out
so many years back, still we have some things

60
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:28,652
to be done – is to clear out our Sahastrara,
first of all.

61
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:40,242
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

62
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:58,002
opened out, then we started feeling the grace,
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

63
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:02,361
grace not the Kundalini.

64
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:11,911
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

65
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:21,141
our chakras opened more, and more threads
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

66
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:28,262
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s
important that you must meditate.

67
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:35,321
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras
will be alright because, as you know, that

68
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:43,082
the peethas, or the controlling centres of
all these chakras, are in the brain around

69
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:46,002
the limbic area.

70
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:55,922
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything
works out in a very different way.

71
00:08:55,922 --> 00:09:02,662
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the
big problem [which] always people ask me.

72
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:05,212
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

73
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:12,782
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand
petals.

74
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:18,861
That’s why I could break it also.

75
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:22,422
As I am today, as you see me.

76
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:27,192
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

77
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:37,311
So this is the illusion which is all the time
there for you, which is very elusive.

78
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:44,801
It had to be that way because you could not
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

79
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:56,382
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

80
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:59,552
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown
outside.

81
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:04,722
Please don’t take photographs when I’m
speaking, alright?

82
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:05,722
You can take later on.

83
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:06,722
There’s no hurry about.

84
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,192
Just pay attention to My lecture.

85
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,592
Please, pay attention.

86
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:13,192
It’s important.

87
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:20,052
It is to be, this, told beforehand, that nobody
should take photographs during puja because

88
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:24,662
it is a very intense thing [that] one has
to work it out.

89
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:26,762
Please, pay attention.

90
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:30,942
Even if you don’t understand, it has effect
on you.

91
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:40,722
So I would request you to pay full attention
to me when I am talking.

92
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:42,922
It works better.

93
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:50,811
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after
by you.

94
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:56,282
It’s the temple of your Mother.

95
00:10:56,282 --> 00:11:01,042
When you say you put me in the heart, actually
you put me in the Sahastrara.

96
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:06,371
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

97
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:14,202
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha,
the centre, which controls the heart, which

98
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:24,352
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say
of Shiva.

99
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:29,592
So when you put me in the heart actually you
put me there.

100
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:37,311
So to raise it from heart to there, or to
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

101
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:44,702
of two types of people.

102
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:53,561
Some people who are sensitive in their heart
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

103
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:57,263
are very sensitive on their heart – the
first thing they do as soon as they see me

104
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:05,032
they put their hands to their heart.

105
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:13,792
And that is what it is, that, if you try to
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

106
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,692
much easier.

107
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,852
To feel me in your heart.

108
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:30,551
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

109
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:37,562
You have to love me as I love you.

110
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:46,392
You have to love each one of yourselves, because
you are all within me.

111
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:52,181
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

112
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,551
Love is within.

113
00:12:53,551 --> 00:13:01,832
And love manifests if, just, you open your
heart.

114
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:08,501
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

115
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,692
Firstly, the conditioning.

116
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:19,241
In the West to express your love is regarded
as sinful actually.

117
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:25,082
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

118
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:26,952
on saying, “I hate you!

119
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,072
I hate you!

120
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,202
I hate you!”

121
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:31,152
But to hate someone is sinful.

122
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:36,361
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

123
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:37,361
So to say that, “I hate you!

124
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:45,452
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

125
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:57,061
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on
saying, “I love you."

126
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:05,992
After all, you must love a person who is so
dear to you.

127
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:15,352
Anyone who has done something good for you,
you love that person.

128
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:22,632
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

129
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:27,702
to love.

130
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:36,952
And if She says that, “They are all within
my body,” so it should be even easier to

131
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,842
love each other.

132
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:53,142
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is
done through this love, this love which is

133
00:14:53,142 --> 00:15:06,462
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

134
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:10,772
any return – nirvaaj.

135
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:16,171
But the conditionings are too much.

136
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:24,491
First the problem of conditioning comes to
you when you think that, “This condition

137
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:36,162
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot
love someone because this is the condition!”

138
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:47,202
But actually the conditioning itself is so
absurd, if you see it one by one.

139
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:58,652
To make it simple, I would like you to understand
the conditioning part where I read once an

140
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:03,871
article, an interesting one, “Who killed
the romance?”

141
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:06,592
So he said “the hairdressers”.

142
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:13,001
I was wondering how is he connecting romance
with the hairdressers?

143
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:21,582
Because people used to go to a hairdresser
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

144
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:25,652
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

145
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:33,871
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore
another type of hairdressing, because everyday

146
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:42,172
new things are coming, then immediately the
husband would say, “Oh I hate you because

147
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:46,372
of your hairdressing!”

148
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,702
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s
why he loves.

149
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:53,122
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you
hate it!

150
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:55,952
“I don’t like it!”

151
00:16:55,952 --> 00:17:03,572
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I
like it”, itself, is a sign that the conditioning

152
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:08,192
is too much.

153
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:13,842
You make a proper hair dress and you dress
up properly and you come out and then suddenly

154
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:18,692
people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

155
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:19,952
Who are you?

156
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:23,921
What right we have got to say that to anyone?

157
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:31,262
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

158
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:40,472
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say
“I hate it”?

159
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:46,452
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright,
I like this but you could do better."

160
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:54,992
That’s the sign of love when you want a
person to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

161
00:17:54,992 --> 00:18:04,312
But this is on a very, very baser level that
we see people.

162
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:15,011
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent
he is, how smart he is, how charismatic he

163
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:23,982
is, how charming – that’s another word
which is very elusive.

164
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:29,502
These are also kind of conditionings of the
mind that you think that a particular style

165
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:39,651
of a person is a loveable person, that you
love that person.

166
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:43,442
It’s so much outside.

167
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:48,281
Or some people actually do not love but show
they love because somebody has more money.

168
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:53,812
And the money, he’s not going to part with,
no doubt, but you love that person because

169
00:18:53,812 --> 00:19:02,862
he has more money, or he has a better car
or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

170
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:12,242
So this kind of an idea one has also is a
killer of love.

171
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:18,901
If love is killed, the joy is lost, you cannot
have joy without love.

172
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:27,622
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

173
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:32,031
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and
subtler.

174
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:39,182
Then we start loving our own children, that’s
very common.

175
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:45,401
I mean, of course, also some people don’t
even love their children, I mean there are

176
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:48,621
all kinds, you see.

177
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:53,362
But then they go on, “This is my child,
this is my child, this is my child!”

178
00:19:53,362 --> 00:20:04,612
That again is the death of love.

179
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:11,031
As I told you before: the sap of the tree
rises, goes to every fruit, goes to every

180
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:14,322
leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

181
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:15,792
It’s not attached.

182
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:25,012
If you are attached to one part or to one
flower because it is more beautiful then the

183
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:29,832
tree will die and the flower will also die.

184
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:35,151
So that’s the death of the love.

185
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:43,052
So you have to have love which doesn’t get
entangled or attached.

186
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:44,572
Every time I tell like this they say, “How
to do it?”

187
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:52,131
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

188
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:58,881
Love of conditioned mind is different.

189
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:08,212
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way
because it is conditioned.

190
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:18,472
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within
us, which is like a balloon on top of our

191
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:19,472
head.

192
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:25,901
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

193
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:33,712
The conditioning of course, like they see
a carpet.

194
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:39,302
Now it is, according to their conditioning,
is not good.

195
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:42,642
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!”

196
00:21:42,642 --> 00:21:43,642
Or something.

197
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:49,312
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

198
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:53,982
And the higher level at the most, is that
you love your own country, so “My country

199
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:54,982
is the best!”

200
00:21:54,982 --> 00:22:02,261
Whether it is killing people, whether it is
destroying the world peace, it’s all right

201
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:04,972
because “I belong to a particular country
which is the best!”

202
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:09,552
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

203
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:14,052
It goes on subtler and subtler.

204
00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:18,612
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

205
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:26,162
Because intelligently if you have understood
that something is good then nobody can save

206
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:29,072
you!

207
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:31,842
Because through your brain you have understood.

208
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:40,852
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading
the book written by Rabindranath Tagore and

209
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:51,662
an Englishman had given a very beautiful preface
to that, an introduction, and he said that

210
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:57,042
the creativity is killed in the West.

211
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:03,222
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian
critic.

212
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:06,032
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

213
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:09,932
You don’t have people who are critics?”

214
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:16,062
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So
what do they criticise?”

215
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:24,271
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time
there was no rain so we had problems and things."

216
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:27,281
He said: “No, no, no, no!

217
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:32,682
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise
the poet, do they criticise an artist?”

218
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:37,882
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

219
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:44,352
“It is created, whatever he felt is created.

220
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:50,732
But supposing he has put something very vulgar
then of course we don’t like it.

221
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:54,832
But if it is created by a beautiful mind,
it has to be beautiful."

222
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:57,072
“Then you don’t criticise?”

223
00:23:57,072 --> 00:24:01,131
He says, “No, because we cannot create like
that.

224
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:09,702
So what business have you got to criticise?”

225
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:15,342
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we
have done: we have norms about everything,

226
00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:17,572
about art about every creation.

227
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:19,342
We don’t like this carpet.

228
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:20,342
Why?

229
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:27,962
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual
understanding of the norms we have reached

230
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:32,192
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we
don’t like it.

231
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:39,262
Can you even create one inch of that?

232
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:43,172
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

233
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:48,212
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार
चेष्टा).

234
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,212
Un-authorised.

235
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:53,482
You have no authority to criticise.

236
00:24:53,482 --> 00:25:00,912
You can’t do anything, so why should you
criticise?

237
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:06,832
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself
that you are not in authority, you are not

238
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:11,131
worthy of it, to criticise.

239
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:16,952
If you are not worthy of it why should you
criticise anything?

240
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:26,371
And, otherwise also, you must know [that]
you are a slave of your ego.

241
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:32,292
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

242
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:34,151
a point, to have some norm.

243
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:40,021
And then it becomes a collective ego of a
particular community, of a particular country,

244
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:42,192
of a particular ideology.

245
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:43,572
It’s collective.

246
00:25:43,572 --> 00:25:53,021
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no
art!”

247
00:25:53,021 --> 00:26:00,881
That is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art.

248
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:04,641
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

249
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:08,712
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered
a lot.

250
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:11,281
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

251
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,402
All these artists suffered a lot.

252
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:16,141
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

253
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:22,732
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

254
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:24,261
So I think people have given up.

255
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:29,072
I met an artist who had done lots of art work
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

256
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:31,332
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

257
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:32,332
It’s created for myself."

258
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:34,922
I said, “I would like to see!”

259
00:26:34,922 --> 00:26:39,952
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I
said, “Why don’t you show?”

260
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,432
He said, “No use.

261
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:42,432
People will just criticise.

262
00:26:42,432 --> 00:26:44,682
I do it for my own pleasure.

263
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:53,391
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

264
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:59,112
So one of the basic things we should avoid
is to criticise others.

265
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:03,962
Better to criticise yourself.

266
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:10,251
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

267
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:17,692
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself,
is the best way.

268
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:26,272
If you know how to laugh at yourself then
you will not object or will not stand in the

269
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:29,761
way of any creativity of another person.

270
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:34,472
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

271
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:36,281
You can criticise anything.

272
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:41,472
You think you have a right.

273
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:43,862
Who has given you this right to criticise?

274
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,432
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

275
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:54,952
How can we criticise anyone?

276
00:27:54,952 --> 00:28:04,192
As saints, as you are now, of course, you
can make out who is caught up, who has given

277
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:08,062
bad vibrations, who has the problem.

278
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,732
You know that.

279
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:11,402
You know it.

280
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:13,072
It’s not conditioning.

281
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:19,552
It’s not just you are doing because there’s
some ego, but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

282
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:23,521
It’s an actual feeling within you.

283
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:27,172
It’s the bodha (बोध: knowledge), by
which you know.

284
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:31,122
Then what should you do?

285
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:35,912
In your love, you have to tell the person,
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you.

286
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,261
Better be corrected!”

287
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:40,531
But in a way that he does it.

288
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:44,281
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

289
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:47,112
you have not loved that person at all.

290
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:49,792
Allow everybody to grow.

291
00:28:49,792 --> 00:29:04,021
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are
very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

292
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:08,531
But also there are some people whom we can
call as very difficult; very!

293
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:16,172
There’s sort of a crack in their head or
something, that part is missing sometimes.

294
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,781
Some screws are loose I think.

295
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:20,832
Sometimes they behave like clowns.

296
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:22,912
And we have known some people.

297
00:29:22,912 --> 00:29:25,881
We just can’t help them.

298
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:32,381
They could be very intelligent otherwise,
they could be very sharp otherwise, but in

299
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:44,312
Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down to that
level where you can say: now the growth is

300
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:46,732
possible.

301
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:51,621
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like
the Sun, there would have been no growth.

302
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:57,872
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would
have been no growth.

303
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:06,781
It had to come to the centre where it had
both the things in proper proportions to grow.

304
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:18,021
In the same way, a human being has to work
out that you keep a moderation and a balance,

305
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:26,212
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

306
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:32,942
That balance you learn when you love someone.

307
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:39,732
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, we have to ask
some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

308
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:50,281
This is out of love for them, because once
they go out, they improve, I have seen, they

309
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:54,511
tremendously improve.

310
00:30:54,511 --> 00:31:02,612
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

311
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:07,222
more nuisance because their ego plays the
part, maybe the conditioning plays the part,

312
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:09,891
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

313
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:14,531
So we have to ask them that, “Please now,
depart for a while."

314
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:20,511
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person
then he has to be straightforward.

315
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:33,262
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that

316
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:39,281
person, that this is the reason why we want
you to be out.

317
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:45,122
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome,
I know that.

318
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:53,432
But you have to show complete patience and
complete understanding and you must talk like

319
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:56,031
a person who loves.

320
00:31:56,031 --> 00:32:08,322
Love has such a power that nobody wants to
do something that will suggest that they don’t

321
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:11,942
love; very powerful thing it is.

322
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:18,172
It binds people in such a beautiful manner
that one wants to do something: for example

323
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:20,991
you want to give me flowers, because you know
I love flowers.

324
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:26,132
So you want to give me flower to suggest that,
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

325
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:33,741
I know you love me but you just want to, sort
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

326
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:40,412
So you want to give me a flower to show your
love and expression of your inner feeling

327
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:44,151
for me.

328
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:48,991
So all these material things can be used to
express your love.

329
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:56,462
They can be very easily expressed in such
a manner that another person knows what is

330
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:57,462
love.

331
00:32:57,462 --> 00:33:01,952
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

332
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:15,822
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;
brain has to love.

333
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:24,312
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,
through your brain and intelligence, if you

334
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:30,891
reach a point where you understand that: No,
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

335
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:32,602
all these things.

336
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:33,982
It’s just love.

337
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,822
It’s simple love.

338
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:42,452
So the same Sahastrara which has been used
before, this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

339
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:48,982
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

340
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:55,511
And there is the culmination where the brain
just loves.

341
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,852
That is the situation one has to reach.

342
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:00,281
It just loves.

343
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:03,391
It knows only love because it has seen the
power of love.

344
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:08,972
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and
then you see the point.

345
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:15,482
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like
Vivekachudamani, this, that, and all those

346
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:18,352
treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No,
nothing!”

347
00:34:18,352 --> 00:34:26,962
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

348
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:32,692
So once you reach that point, we can say now
you are in nirvikalpa because there is no

349
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:36,602
vikalpa, there is no doubt in your head; because
you love.

350
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,152
In love you don’t doubt, no question.

351
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:39,872
Only when you think you doubt.

352
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:46,572
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just
love, because you enjoy love.

353
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:51,282
And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

354
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:57,092
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been
opened out.

355
00:34:57,092 --> 00:35:04,812
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:
through our meditative processes, through

356
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,622
understanding ourselves and others.

357
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:12,622
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s
no way out now.

358
00:35:12,622 --> 00:35:15,372
We have reached to the end of it now.

359
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:17,292
The whole logic has ended up now.

360
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:21,402
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

361
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:26,852
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

362
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:36,242
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of
it.

363
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:50,013
That is what one has to learn by reasoning
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

364
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:52,092
May God bless you all.
