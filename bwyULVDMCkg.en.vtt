00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
﻿So today we have come here to Spain,

00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:40.476
and there are so many
other Spanish Sahaja Yogis here,

00:07:54.697 --> 00:08:01.191
and you all have met them. By that,
they are very much strengthened in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:07.022 --> 00:08:11.780
that they feel that
they have brothers and sisters all over the world.

00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:21.152
Because in Spain there are very few Sahaja Yogis

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:29.038
and they feel quite lost because they are so few.

00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:41.973
But by your coming here,

00:08:42.174 --> 00:08:47.880
it is a kind of a one hand helping another hand.

00:08:57.798 --> 00:09:04.168
Now Spain is developing materially,

00:09:10.324 --> 00:09:14.060
and it is . . .

00:09:14.981 --> 00:09:18.101
this time they have to be careful:

00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:30.700
They need not go all the
way to the overdeveloped state

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.150
and then suffer,

00:09:43.418 --> 00:09:46.418
and that suffering should not

00:09:47.308 --> 00:09:53.060
become a kind of a punishment to
them like in many affluent countries.

00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:09.420
Because as materialism grows,

00:10:11.316 --> 00:10:14.430
it tries to overpower human beings.

00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:25.260
But if after realization,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:32.420
the materialism starts growing,
you master the matter.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.790
Then matter doesn’t sit on your head,

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.570
because with realization you have discretion.

00:10:56.904 --> 00:11:00.538
And actually, materialism is,

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:05.294
to be understood through
Lakshmi Tattwa, Lakshmi principal.

00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:21.799
If you develop the wisdom in Sahaj Yoga,

00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:30.860
then you understand how
far to go with materialism.

00:11:36.794 --> 00:11:40.794
Matter is for you, you are not for the matter.

00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:49.660
Now I’ll tell you, gradually
how matter sits on our head.

00:11:55.602 --> 00:11:58.187
Before realization,

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:05.060
first we start using the matter for our comfort.

00:12:10.424 --> 00:12:13.643
Through science, we develop ways and methods

00:12:13.843 --> 00:12:18.436
by which we develop a,

00:12:20.155 --> 00:12:24.628
life which gives you more comfort.

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:38.700
In the beginning, it is all right that we
get sufficient food, a proper house to live in;

00:12:47.797 --> 00:12:52.640
but by that time we have already
become the slave of the matter.

00:12:59.116 --> 00:13:02.116
But matter is a dead thing.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.850
We just change the forms of matter –

00:13:10.937 --> 00:13:13.437
from dead to dead –

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.170
but we cannot do any living work.

00:13:22.056 --> 00:13:25.460
Now, this matter starts giving us habits,

00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:33.293
then we cannot get out of those habits,

00:13:36.438 --> 00:13:40.220
and gradually we start becoming slave of matter.

00:13:44.302 --> 00:13:47.114
It does not go that far.

00:13:50.086 --> 00:13:53.380
Now, if you have too many machineries,

00:13:56.594 --> 00:14:00.940
you produce things out of proportion.

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:09.710
Like you have so many cars.

00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:15.660
In Paris, everybody is on the road only.

00:14:18.703 --> 00:14:22.340
As soon as you are on the road,
you are on the road all the time.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.695
Better to be in the house.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:33.740
And you spend hours together.

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:40.588
Then you start producing other things.

00:14:43.412 --> 00:14:48.780
Like, supposing they are producing clothes:

00:14:52.917 --> 00:14:55.565
the factories have to run –

00:14:59.005 --> 00:15:01.848
you cannot stop the factory.

00:15:03.495 --> 00:15:08.053
So then they start producing things such a lot,

00:15:08.253 --> 00:15:10.932
they don’t know how to sell it.

00:15:15.304 --> 00:15:19.020
Then they say that,
“All right, let us have fashions.”

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:27.820
Then these manufacturers float fashion houses.

00:15:32.895 --> 00:15:35.605
Now the fashion starts.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.580
With that, everybody
changes their clothes every year.

00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:46.540
They have to be according to the fashion,

00:15:48.505 --> 00:15:51.270
such a lot of money is wasted,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.439
but we also lose our individuality.

00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:07.540
In America, they play another trick,
also here I think – must be everywhere.

00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:16.791
Every year they produce a new type of handles,

00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:21.820
new type of tiles, new type of bathrooms.

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:33.379
If you go to an American house,
better ask about the bathroom,

00:16:39.508 --> 00:16:41.955
otherwise when you enter in, maybe,

00:16:42.155 --> 00:16:46.851
you may be just drenched with
water with some showers falling on you.

00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:56.540
Or you may sit in the tub, and you may
press it and the whole tub might come like that.

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:06.145
Their beds are also funny; you may press
on some button and the whole bed may come up.

00:17:12.304 --> 00:17:16.978
They have beds where they just
can fold on this part, or that part –

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:23.380
it is terrible, I mean if you press some buttons,
you might be going into acrobats all the time.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.588
There is no need to do all that.

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:39.380
But when you have out-of-proportion
machineries, then you have to do it,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:50.617
but that is how you become
slaves of these entrepreneurs.

00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:59.701
But in Sahaja Yoga, when you come in,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.900
you know how to do living work.

00:18:09.677 --> 00:18:13.874
Like in the affluent countries,

00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:18.140
they use seeds which are hybrid.

00:18:24.051 --> 00:18:26.144
Hybrid.

00:18:31.837 --> 00:18:36.526
These hybrid seeds are of no nourishment to us,

00:18:36.727 --> 00:18:39.540
they are no good for our brains, they confuse us.

00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:52.620
Especially the hybrid animals,
their milk confuses us.

00:18:59.312 --> 00:19:02.740
Hybrid animals themselves are very confused.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.105
But in Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:10.306 --> 00:19:14.049
you take the ordinary seeds

00:19:18.569 --> 00:19:21.115
and you vibrate them.

00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:25.694
If you vibrate them, then what happens,

00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:33.895
that you start getting seeds
which are even better than hybrid.

00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:47.140
I tried an experiment with a sunflower.

00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:56.140
So, I developed a sunflower about 2 kilos weight,

00:19:59.707 --> 00:20:02.940
about one foot diameter,

00:20:07.233 --> 00:20:11.980
and such big, big seeds that you can’t
make them out to be sunflower seeds.

00:20:18.689 --> 00:20:22.860
So the collective was so amazed at it,

00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:31.140
and they felt that this
kind of seed will solve all our oil problem.

00:20:35.941 --> 00:20:39.043
Same thing happens with the animals.

00:20:41.296 --> 00:20:45.460
You take an ordinary cow, Indian ordinary cow,

00:20:50.198 --> 00:20:53.380
and you give her vibrated water to drink,

00:20:56.588 --> 00:21:02.500
and she gives
about the same milk as an Australian cow.

00:21:08.808 --> 00:21:13.820
But the Australian cow’s milk
can make you confused and mad

00:21:20.722 --> 00:21:25.820
because we have seen that the Australian cows,

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:32.151
when they are in India, they don’t know
where they stand, they just run amok,

00:21:40.477 --> 00:21:43.312
so what must be their milk?

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:51.900
But an Indian cow, if she gets
realization through this vibrated water,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.900
she gives milk which is very good for the brain.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:13.378
So that is how we improve the
quality of our animals by Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:21.272 --> 00:22:24.649
Now regarding matter, we have to understand

00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:28.740
that matter is only good for giving it to others,

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.900
but if it is given by a realized soul,

00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:46.499
it has tremendous effects.

00:22:50.399 --> 00:22:54.820
Before Gregoire wanted to write
his book, I gave him a fountain pen,

00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:08.020
and he said, “I never
wrote a book,” and he started writing so well.

00:23:15.172 --> 00:23:18.860
Same with Rustom; he became a scholar.

00:23:23.449 --> 00:23:27.300
So, Sahaja Yoga gives you

00:23:38.506 --> 00:23:41.670
an additional power

00:23:47.484 --> 00:23:52.708
by which you can neutralize
the bad effects of materialism.

00:23:58.898 --> 00:24:05.460
Now, say, supposing in India, in England,

00:24:05.965 --> 00:24:09.340
you have to offer drinks to people.

00:24:15.427 --> 00:24:18.740
So there are ten types of
glasses you have to have.

00:24:24.768 --> 00:24:27.416
Only one is sufficient

00:24:28.368 --> 00:24:32.180
to drink anything;
why to have ten? It’s a headache.

00:24:37.544 --> 00:24:42.002
Now if you have to use spoons and
forks, then you have all elaborations,

00:24:42.202 --> 00:24:45.900
and you can have a ten-place setting.

00:24:52.709 --> 00:24:56.340
But if you can use your
hands, they are very clean—

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.169
need not have so many elaborations.

00:25:06.587 --> 00:25:10.175
But these elaborations we
have not because we want them,

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:14.700
but because of these
entrepreneurs – they force on us.

00:25:22.829 --> 00:25:26.078
But there is a deeper influence:

00:25:28.703 --> 00:25:32.535
how people control you through matter.

00:25:36.638 --> 00:25:40.700
Now, supposing they go to somebody’s house,

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:51.049
and they find a kind of a spoon missing –
because there could be a spoon for avocado,

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:54.140
say, a special spoon for avocado.

00:25:59.884 --> 00:26:02.855
Now if that spoon is not there, they will say,

00:26:03.055 --> 00:26:07.413
“Oh, these people have no sense,”

00:26:13.112 --> 00:26:17.460
and they will ask:
“Have you got a spoon for avocado?”

00:26:23.652 --> 00:26:27.468
So it is very shameless and it is very arrogant,

00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:33.906
to insult another person.

00:26:36.348 --> 00:26:41.436
A housewife, supposing you are a guest,

00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:45.620
she will be more worried about
her carpet than about her guests.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.340
And this kind of a thing can go too
far, and a person can become very dry.

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:10.004
Such people are very disgusting

00:27:12.993 --> 00:27:17.703
and insulting type, an insulting.

00:27:21.955 --> 00:27:26.270
There is another way they
control you through matter,

00:27:30.377 --> 00:27:35.328
that they will say that

00:27:36.047 --> 00:27:40.983
now you have to say, for a husband,

00:27:41.183 --> 00:27:45.580
“You must get me this,
otherwise I will be very angry.”

00:27:52.294 --> 00:27:56.980
If the husband breaks one
cup, the wife will be on his head,

00:28:04.012 --> 00:28:07.260
as if the cup is more important than the husband.

00:28:10.593 --> 00:28:14.907
She can get another husband,
she can also get another cup.

00:28:18.548 --> 00:28:23.940
See, the whole human dignity is reduced to matter,

00:28:29.695 --> 00:28:32.900
and this kind of controlling goes on.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.606
Children also control parents.

00:28:41.893 --> 00:28:47.780
They see on the television some
sort of a toy, and they ask the parents.

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:57.541
Now if the parents don’t give
the toy, they will not eat their food.

00:29:02.951 --> 00:29:06.620
They’ll cry and weep and trouble the parents.

00:29:09.689 --> 00:29:13.340
So then the parents: “All right,
get them the toy, let them have it.”

00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:20.289
And the child plays with
the toy, not with the parents.

00:29:24.803 --> 00:29:30.126
Now two friends will meet, and they’ll
say, “We must go and see a film together.”

00:29:33.482 --> 00:29:37.740
They don’t talk to each other,
there’s no rapport, there’s no friendship.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.660
They must have something in between them.

00:29:47.517 --> 00:29:51.330
There is no direct rapport between
the children, between the friends,

00:29:51.531 --> 00:29:54.173
between husband and wife.

00:30:00.795 --> 00:30:03.780
Matter is to beautify your life,

00:30:06.737 --> 00:30:09.432
not to make it ugly

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:15.020
and create problems between each other.

00:30:18.906 --> 00:30:22.056
Now the French will not like the English

00:30:22.257 --> 00:30:27.300
because they use their fork
and knives in a different way.

00:30:35.195 --> 00:30:38.461
And the English think no end of themselves

00:30:38.662 --> 00:30:41.695
because they know the English language.

00:30:47.725 --> 00:30:53.780
All this kind of nonsensical feelings
come in through this kind of materialism,

00:31:00.503 --> 00:31:03.300
and we are no more collective,

00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:08.140
and the collectivity gets lost.

00:31:09.914 --> 00:31:15.473
But then we find out wrong
methods to get into collectivity.

00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:24.989
Like, we take to alcoholism,

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:30.705
because after alcohol we feel abandoned
and we can laugh and enjoy together.

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:42.820
So, otherwise, if not, we go for holiday.

00:31:46.231 --> 00:31:49.100
All the women must show off their body

00:31:51.729 --> 00:31:54.340
to attract the attention of men.

00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:01.940
Men must show off their bodies
to attract the attention of women,

00:32:05.811 --> 00:32:08.311
but no one knows, no one

00:32:12.709 --> 00:32:15.396
– it’s a joyless pursuit.

00:32:18.823 --> 00:32:23.420
And the way they quarrel among
themselves for all these small, small things,

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.291
they are really joy-killers.

00:32:33.434 --> 00:32:37.900
As a result of all these
things, we have lost the art,

00:32:39.185 --> 00:32:42.044
we have lost the art,

00:32:46.091 --> 00:32:51.185
we have lost the deftness, the deftness;

00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:59.281
and now wherever you go, what you find ugly things

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:06.107
like the airport of Charles de Gaulle

00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:19.090
— it looks like a factory, and I don’t
know how you feel in that place.

00:33:23.153 --> 00:33:26.540
There is no cosiness in the household;

00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:35.460
the house is so bare and so insipid,

00:33:37.901 --> 00:33:40.947
and the people are so dry and stupid.

00:33:43.277 --> 00:33:47.536
There’s no joy in the family, so also
the children run away from the houses

00:33:47.736 --> 00:33:52.805
at the age of eighteen,
or sixteen, whatever may be the case.

00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:02.740
So instead of human beings,
we start creating robots, you see,

00:34:06.807 --> 00:34:09.420
controlled by entrepreneurs.

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:16.496
This is the situation.
That’s why you play into the hands

00:34:16.696 --> 00:34:22.220
of all kinds of things like
psychologists, like Freud.

00:34:29.878 --> 00:34:33.300
Any new idea comes in, they jump at it,

00:34:37.171 --> 00:34:42.540
and that’s how they suffer – the
result is they have got AIDS now.

00:34:47.872 --> 00:34:51.020
There’s no logic in their heads.

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:58.141
They don’t understand
that this is just exploitation.

00:35:00.881 --> 00:35:05.340
After Sahaja Yoga, you do
understand this is exploitation.

00:35:10.047 --> 00:35:13.460
Now they have plastics and nylons,

00:35:16.605 --> 00:35:22.380
and they don’t know what to do
with the plastic, how to get rid of it.

00:35:26.243 --> 00:35:30.780
Then they have acid rains, acid rains

00:35:34.597 --> 00:35:41.180
and the trees are affected by that.

00:35:48.438 --> 00:35:54.340
Now in Switzerland—which is
such a corrupt country, I should say,

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:59.340
it is taking the money, corrupt
money, from every country

00:36:05.498 --> 00:36:08.810
—who are absolute materialists

00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:14.500
are suffering from this acid rain.

00:36:19.024 --> 00:36:21.900
Most of their trees are destroyed

00:36:24.824 --> 00:36:31.456
and they have avalanches. All these
big, big mountains that they have,

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:37.173
the ice starts flowing downward
because nobody can hold it,

00:36:43.317 --> 00:36:45.910
and now there are floods.

00:36:48.866 --> 00:36:52.499
The nature starts acting.

00:36:57.104 --> 00:37:03.100
So, whether they progress
outward in this wrong direction,

00:37:03.736 --> 00:37:10.380
or they try things inwards like Freudian methods

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:13.540
– both are dangerous

00:37:25.716 --> 00:37:28.261
and are destructive,

00:37:29.468 --> 00:37:31.978
and in this destruction,

00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:37.054
who are lost are the people who are innocent.

00:37:44.054 --> 00:37:48.460
So, one has to develop that wisdom within oneself,

00:37:51.843 --> 00:37:57.540
that we are human beings here,
part and parcel of one whole,

00:38:05.224 --> 00:38:11.220
and only the human beings can get
Self-Realization and can feel that oneness.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.740
And such a personality is a satisfied personality.

00:38:27.206 --> 00:38:30.620
They do not try to exploit other countries,

00:38:32.929 --> 00:38:35.660
other people;

00:38:36.008 --> 00:38:38.508
they live satisfied with themselves.

00:38:41.461 --> 00:38:45.340
They enjoy their compassion and their generosity.

00:38:48.133 --> 00:38:51.140
They open their houses to everyone,

00:38:53.566 --> 00:38:56.860
they open their hearts to everyone.

00:38:58.675 --> 00:39:02.955
They make their houses beautiful
for others, not for themselves.

00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:12.300
We were first in London in a country house,

00:39:14.731 --> 00:39:17.460
and there were six other houses;

00:39:19.731 --> 00:39:22.750
there were quite rich people living there.

00:39:25.562 --> 00:39:29.517
Every Saturday, Sunday, the
poor husband had to mow the lawn,

00:39:29.717 --> 00:39:34.740
and the wife would stand
up, telling him, “Do it better,”

00:39:42.627 --> 00:39:48.460
and used to polish all the brass, you see.

00:39:53.425 --> 00:39:55.925
Same with his wife.

00:39:57.581 --> 00:40:03.460
And not even a rat would enter that house.

00:40:06.785 --> 00:40:10.460
And they were surprised that in our house

00:40:15.706 --> 00:40:18.500
there were so many people coming.

00:40:20.481 --> 00:40:26.300
And they came and saw our house and
were surprised that our house was so beautiful

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.460
and so neat and clean.

00:40:36.847 --> 00:40:41.180
I told them that if you
really have a beautiful house,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.020
even children don’t want to disturb it;

00:40:50.828 --> 00:40:53.980
they treat the house like a temple.

00:40:56.382 --> 00:41:02.860
But if you do not make the house
beautiful and acceptable to others,

00:41:08.215 --> 00:41:13.553
then you are only busy
cleaning for yourself all the brass,

00:41:13.753 --> 00:41:18.740
all the crystal, all the
glass, everything yourself.

00:41:29.423 --> 00:41:31.700
And what is the purpose?

00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:36.420
Then Monday you are
again tired, sitting very tired,

00:41:40.409 --> 00:41:44.980
but if you had kept the doors open
to others, they would have enjoyed.

00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.671
Then it had some purpose.

00:41:54.461 --> 00:41:58.420
So purposeless life is absolutely joyless.

00:42:03.674 --> 00:42:10.020
That is the problem, is that people
get exhausted for nonsensical things.

00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:22.820
If one spoon is lost,
they will just die ten times.

00:42:28.699 --> 00:42:33.419
Thank God, in India, we are not
such materialists—yet, we might.

00:42:36.722 --> 00:42:40.220
We might become but can't say.

00:42:40.482 --> 00:42:45.940
but we have now a short circuit: we are
coming to Sahaja Yoga before we are developing.

00:42:53.225 --> 00:42:57.295
Now the culture is also very
different and is an ancient culture.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:07.433
That should be the culture of
Sahaja Yogis – will be that culture.

00:43:15.086 --> 00:43:20.500
Like, now, if somebody spills any coffee say,

00:43:21.075 --> 00:43:25.288
nobody will say anything—“Oh it’s all right,
it’s all right, no, no, no it doesn’t matter”

00:43:25.488 --> 00:43:28.140
—even if it’s a Persian carpet.

00:43:35.699 --> 00:43:39.380
Until the guest is in the
house, you will not wipe it.

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:46.997
Even if children break
something, we don’t punish them,

00:43:47.197 --> 00:43:51.700
that: “You have broken this and it’s
very wrong, you have broken that.”

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.340
Nothing of the kind. “It’s all
right, you be careful” – that’s all.

00:44:01.118 --> 00:44:03.380
We don’t scold them for that,

00:44:06.852 --> 00:44:11.100
but we tell them that, “You
be careful, you might get hurt.”

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.570
No importance is given to things.

00:44:18.896 --> 00:44:23.220
Also, in language, we cannot
say to somebody: “I hate you.”

00:44:28.326 --> 00:44:30.980
That’s not allowed.

00:44:31.492 --> 00:44:34.420
Or “I don’t like you,”

00:44:35.893 --> 00:44:38.393
or “I believe in this.”

00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:42.239
They will say: “Who are you?

00:44:43.798 --> 00:44:46.300
What do you think of yourself?”

00:44:47.125 --> 00:44:49.900
The parents will immediately correct,

00:44:54.169 --> 00:44:58.185
and that is the correcting point
which helps throughout the life.

00:44:58.386 --> 00:45:03.020
You don’t say harsh things like:
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

00:45:11.446 --> 00:45:14.313
We have to appreciate everything:

00:45:17.535 --> 00:45:20.180
learn to appreciate other human beings,

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.090
to enjoy other people,

00:45:28.327 --> 00:45:30.827
to see to their good points.

00:45:33.004 --> 00:45:38.580
If you see only their bad points, you will
get all their bad points. Where is your attention?

00:45:44.905 --> 00:45:50.580
Instead of getting too many plastics,
you have one little nice thing with you.

00:45:56.842 --> 00:45:59.660
That is something joy-giving.

00:46:03.133 --> 00:46:05.780
Keep your houses open to others.

00:46:08.894 --> 00:46:12.220
Don’t get worried how your door is

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:17.255
– if somebody touches the door it
might spoil its polish or something like that.

00:46:23.436 --> 00:46:27.873
Enjoy looking after others,
having concern for them.

00:46:32.637 --> 00:46:38.220
They always say, “Mother, You look so
young despite Your age and You work so hard.”

00:46:44.513 --> 00:46:48.834
It is because I love everyone
much more than I care for Myself

00:46:54.502 --> 00:46:57.740
because I have so much concern for everyone.

00:47:00.205 --> 00:47:02.705
That keeps Me very happy.

00:47:04.615 --> 00:47:08.500
If I could give something to
others, that makes Me very happy.

00:47:12.778 --> 00:47:17.660
If I can cook for everyone, that’s very good.

00:47:22.266 --> 00:47:27.437
Only, I think, two years back, I went to

00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:32.015
– that’s about three years back

00:47:32.215 --> 00:47:37.521
– I went to Australia and cooked for
five hundred people in two places

00:47:43.367 --> 00:47:49.300
and enjoyed really seeing them enjoy My food.

00:47:52.398 --> 00:47:54.980
It was such a joy-giving thing.

00:47:57.218 --> 00:48:00.700
The greatest joy is in giving others.

00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:06.592
As soon as this attitude changes,

00:48:06.792 --> 00:48:11.822
you’ll be amazed the
materialism will be at your feet

00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:23.376
because in Sahaja Yoga it works that way.

00:48:26.673 --> 00:48:29.700
I’ll give you an example.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.683
Once I was going for a Guru Puja,

00:48:33.883 --> 00:48:39.274
and I wanted to take some
presents for all the leaders.

00:48:46.104 --> 00:48:52.465
In London, I don’t go out shopping, but I went
out, and I was exhausted. I couldn’t get anything,

00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:03.660
and I came in the evening very
tired and there was nothing I could find,

00:49:08.375 --> 00:49:14.580
and I thought that, I better now open My
storeroom and try to find out something there.

00:49:20.186 --> 00:49:26.420
And at that time, a Sahaja Yogi just said, “Mother
there’s some boy who wants to sell his paintings.”

00:49:34.002 --> 00:49:37.100
I just came rushing down,

00:49:39.464 --> 00:49:43.220
and he had beautiful paintings with him

00:49:45.295 --> 00:49:49.180
at a very reasonable price that I could afford,

00:49:52.755 --> 00:49:55.820
and they were exactly the number I wanted.

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:05.500
So I bought them, and you know in one of the
Guru pujas I gave beautiful paintings to everyone.

00:50:12.832 --> 00:50:16.260
This time I had no time to buy any presents

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.740
for the leaders; I was going to France and here.

00:50:28.017 --> 00:50:31.820
I thought, I must have
something and now what to do?

00:50:36.535 --> 00:50:43.300
I have to take something for
Jose Antonio and also for Patrick.

00:50:47.643 --> 00:50:50.340
So, our plane was delayed,

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:57.420
and I got beautiful
fountain pens for both of them.

00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:05.838
I was so very happy I could buy them there.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.970
It’s so nice, you see, to buy for others.

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:17.260
I find it difficult to buy anything for Myself.

00:51:21.515 --> 00:51:28.260
It is so many times I have seen how
suddenly you get the things that you want,

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.940
as the matter is at your feet.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:44.082
I had bought some chocolates for the children

00:51:44.283 --> 00:51:50.820
for the puja in – not puja, but visit to Paris,

00:51:55.847 --> 00:52:00.580
and when they came in the
evening for music, we forgot about it.

00:52:06.295 --> 00:52:09.260
But at the airport we suddenly found them,

00:52:12.654 --> 00:52:17.780
so I gave all that to small
children and to big children also,

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.140
and we had a nice time at the airport.

00:52:26.996 --> 00:52:32.300
All these small, small things give
so much of joy, such an ocean of joy!

00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:39.830
You just try these things.

00:52:43.635 --> 00:52:46.780
In the beginning of Sahaj Yoga,

00:52:47.556 --> 00:52:53.225
I had gone for a program to meet
the Sahaja Yogis at Gavin’s place,

00:53:00.674 --> 00:53:02.806
At Gavin's place.

00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:08.778
and his wife was no good for
– she was cooking and all that,

00:53:08.978 --> 00:53:11.831
she was schizophrenic type,

00:53:16.597 --> 00:53:20.500
but Gavin said, “Mother, will you
please have Your dinner with us?”

00:53:24.817 --> 00:53:28.063
So I thought, he has cooked only for Me,

00:53:31.444 --> 00:53:35.140
so I allowed everybody to go away,

00:53:38.301 --> 00:53:40.900
and he was in the kitchen.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:45.063
He came out and said, “Mother, where are they?”

00:53:50.706 --> 00:53:53.500
I said, “Why? They have gone away.”

00:53:55.989 --> 00:53:59.540
He said, “See, Mother,
I have cooked for all of them,

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.240
and why did they go away?”

00:54:04.675 --> 00:54:11.153
You see, his sweetness filled my heart with joy;

00:54:16.931 --> 00:54:20.863
I felt what a sweet man he is.

00:54:24.023 --> 00:54:28.626
He’s from Scotland, and they say
that Scottish people are very miserly,

00:54:28.835 --> 00:54:32.620
but I found Gavin to be a very generous person.

00:54:39.913 --> 00:54:43.936
Like that, I like when the
Sahaja Yogis talk good of others,

00:54:44.136 --> 00:54:48.263
try to help them, and try
to be nice to each other.

00:54:48.463 --> 00:54:51.380
That is the most joy-giving thing.

00:54:57.837 --> 00:55:02.719
All these things will cut out
the domination of matter upon us.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.340
We should not care for the matter.

00:55:12.711 --> 00:55:17.922
Of course, one should care for
something that is given to you with love.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:28.580
One day Gregoire had
given Me two little, little horses.

00:55:32.952 --> 00:55:36.060
Then I came home, I saw they were missing,

00:55:39.697 --> 00:55:44.220
and I went round the whole house seeing them:
“Where are they?” I said, “Where are they gone?”

00:55:46.693 --> 00:55:49.882
So I had My servants,
My domestics; they were surprised,

00:55:50.082 --> 00:55:54.780
that: “There are so many things in the house,
why is She worried about these two little horses?”

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.153
So, My husband came back in the evening.

00:56:05.353 --> 00:56:09.580
I said, “Have you seen those two little
horses that Gregoire had given Me?”

00:56:15.621 --> 00:56:21.779
“Yes, yes,” he said. “I have kept them properly
in my cupboard because children were there,

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:25.565
they would have broken and
You would have felt bad about them.”

00:56:30.943 --> 00:56:35.780
I had so much silver, so many
expensive things—he didn’t bother about that,

00:56:40.253 --> 00:56:44.060
because it had an expression of love in that,

00:56:48.103 --> 00:56:52.775
which is much more than all the
gold and all the silver put together.

00:56:58.655 --> 00:57:03.820
This is what we have to understand,
that love is more important than anything else.

00:57:08.504 --> 00:57:11.780
You must compete in loving each other more,

00:57:16.113 --> 00:57:20.020
compete in being kind to each other,

00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:27.892
and compete in being humbler to each other,

00:57:31.459 --> 00:57:36.820
compete in doing something for others,

00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:45.420
and in saying very sweet things to others.

00:57:50.401 --> 00:57:54.660
Try to think of doing something very sweet.

00:57:59.296 --> 00:58:03.993
Like once I went to buy a
sari for Myself and then I found

00:58:04.194 --> 00:58:06.506
– you see, for Myself I am quite miserly;

00:58:06.707 --> 00:58:10.732
I thought it was rather
expensive and I didn’t buy it.

00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:26.471
And another Sahaja Yogi was there,

00:58:26.671 --> 00:58:30.878
with Me, I didn’t know, but he bought that sari,

00:58:36.547 --> 00:58:40.180
and the next day he brought it to Me as a present.

00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:46.780
You don’t know the joy I felt

00:58:48.675 --> 00:58:52.140
because I know I’m very miserly about Myself,

00:58:57.901 --> 00:59:02.220
and then that sari was so
much appreciated by everyone.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.100
Maybe it had that love.

00:59:12.654 --> 00:59:18.260
This is what it is: we
have to feel the power of love,

00:59:23.108 --> 00:59:26.540
then everything vibrates, the matter vibrates,

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:34.575
and you can feel the vibrations from a distance.

00:59:38.999 --> 00:59:43.087
If you come and open My cupboard

00:59:43.288 --> 00:59:47.578
and try to arrange My saris,
you will be all filled with vibrations.

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:03.340
Anything that you touch will have vibrations.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:13.140
So, it is important that we should
learn to love and improve our vibrations

01:00:19.019 --> 01:00:22.740
so that we can spread love all over

01:00:26.572 --> 01:00:32.500
and remove the people from
the shackles of materialism.

01:00:39.362 --> 01:00:45.500
I wanted to talk to people in Spain
about this, and for all the other people,

01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:50.838
I would say that they should come back

01:00:51.283 --> 01:00:54.186
because they have gone too far into it,

01:01:04.881 --> 01:01:07.460
because matter complicates you.

01:01:10.035 --> 01:01:12.820
It reacts and makes you think more.

01:01:16.121 --> 01:01:19.371
It doesn’t allow your
attention to be steady.

01:01:21.955 --> 01:01:26.220
If you see anything beautiful,
you just look at it without thinking,

01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:38.326
then you will realize
what beauty lies in the matter.

01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:48.260
In the Zen system of meditation,

01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:54.940
Vidhitama, the one who was
the founder of Zen system, tried it.

01:02:02.194 --> 01:02:05.637
I think I’ve talked about it in some other lecture.

01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:17.980
With all My love to you, I
would say that try to love each other.

01:02:24.686 --> 01:02:29.845
And you have seen that, in India
when you travel, it’s not so comfortable

01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:38.932
and we cannot give that
comfort in the small places we go to,

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:47.060
but still, you all enjoy it so much.

01:02:51.407 --> 01:02:54.699
You don’t want comfort,
you want the comfort of love.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:01.598
You enjoy each other’s company so much

01:03:03.668 --> 01:03:10.580
and that overflowing love of your
host country that is India, Indians.

01:03:16.842 --> 01:03:20.220
That is the sign of good Sahaja Yogis.

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.780
Because there is a big purpose in our lives

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.510
– greatest of all.

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:42.300
What Abraham Lincoln did,
or what Mahatma Gandhi did,

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:46.340
your work is much greater and subtler,

01:03:55.812 --> 01:03:58.380
because you can do living work.

01:04:01.062 --> 01:04:04.020
So, we don’t have to become sanyasis,

01:04:05.719 --> 01:04:08.219
we don’t have to give up anything,

01:04:10.286 --> 01:04:13.500
but we have to change our attitude.

01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:19.371
We have to develop that detachment.

01:04:21.835 --> 01:04:24.527
May God bless you all.
