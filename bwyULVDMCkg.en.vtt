07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
﻿So today we have come here to Spain,

07:33.937 --> 07:40.476
and there are so many
other Spanish Sahaja Yogis here,

07:54.697 --> 08:01.191
and you all have met them. By that,
they are very much strengthened in Sahaja Yoga,

08:07.022 --> 08:11.780
that they feel that
they have brothers and sisters all over the world.

08:17.152 --> 08:21.152
Because in Spain there are very few Sahaja Yogis

08:22.210 --> 08:29.038
and they feel quite lost because they are so few.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.973
But by your coming here,

08:42.174 --> 08:47.880
it is a kind of a one hand helping another hand.

08:57.798 --> 09:04.168
Now Spain is developing materially,

09:10.324 --> 09:14.060
and it is . . .

09:14.981 --> 09:18.101
this time they have to be careful:

09:23.085 --> 09:30.700
They need not go all the
way to the overdeveloped state

09:36.650 --> 09:39.150
and then suffer,

09:43.418 --> 09:46.418
and that suffering should not

09:47.308 --> 09:53.060
become a kind of a punishment to
them like in many affluent countries.

10:04.301 --> 10:09.420
Because as materialism grows,

10:11.316 --> 10:14.430
it tries to overpower human beings.

10:21.415 --> 10:25.260
But if after realization,

10:26.290 --> 10:32.420
the materialism starts growing,
you master the matter.

10:42.790 --> 10:45.790
Then matter doesn’t sit on your head,

10:48.570 --> 10:51.570
because with realization you have discretion.

10:56.904 --> 11:00.538
And actually, materialism is,

11:00.794 --> 11:05.294
to be understood through
Lakshmi Tattwa, Lakshmi principal.

11:16.049 --> 11:21.799
If you develop the wisdom in Sahaj Yoga,

11:26.451 --> 11:30.860
then you understand how
far to go with materialism.

11:36.794 --> 11:40.794
Matter is for you, you are not for the matter.

11:45.565 --> 11:49.660
Now I’ll tell you, gradually
how matter sits on our head.

11:55.602 --> 11:58.187
Before realization,

12:00.501 --> 12:05.060
first we start using the matter for our comfort.

12:10.424 --> 12:13.643
Through science, we develop ways and methods

12:13.843 --> 12:18.436
by which we develop a,

12:20.155 --> 12:24.628
life which gives you more comfort.

12:31.765 --> 12:38.700
In the beginning, it is all right that we
get sufficient food, a proper house to live in;

12:47.797 --> 12:52.640
but by that time we have already
become the slave of the matter.

12:59.116 --> 13:02.116
But matter is a dead thing.

13:04.850 --> 13:07.850
We just change the forms of matter –

13:10.937 --> 13:13.437
from dead to dead –

13:16.170 --> 13:19.170
but we cannot do any living work.

13:22.056 --> 13:25.460
Now, this matter starts giving us habits,

13:30.121 --> 13:33.293
then we cannot get out of those habits,

13:36.438 --> 13:40.220
and gradually we start becoming slave of matter.

13:44.302 --> 13:47.114
It does not go that far.

13:50.086 --> 13:53.380
Now, if you have too many machineries,

13:56.594 --> 14:00.940
you produce things out of proportion.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.710
Like you have so many cars.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.660
In Paris, everybody is on the road only.

14:18.703 --> 14:22.340
As soon as you are on the road,
you are on the road all the time.

14:26.110 --> 14:28.695
Better to be in the house.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.740
And you spend hours together.

14:37.588 --> 14:40.588
Then you start producing other things.

14:43.412 --> 14:48.780
Like, supposing they are producing clothes:

14:52.917 --> 14:55.565
the factories have to run –

14:59.005 --> 15:01.848
you cannot stop the factory.

15:03.495 --> 15:08.053
So then they start producing things such a lot,

15:08.253 --> 15:10.932
they don’t know how to sell it.

15:15.304 --> 15:19.020
Then they say that,
“All right, let us have fashions.”

15:23.798 --> 15:27.820
Then these manufacturers float fashion houses.

15:32.895 --> 15:35.605
Now the fashion starts.

15:36.530 --> 15:40.580
With that, everybody
changes their clothes every year.

15:43.787 --> 15:46.540
They have to be according to the fashion,

15:48.505 --> 15:51.270
such a lot of money is wasted,

15:53.940 --> 15:57.439
but we also lose our individuality.

16:02.123 --> 16:07.540
In America, they play another trick,
also here I think – must be everywhere.

16:12.266 --> 16:16.791
Every year they produce a new type of handles,

16:16.991 --> 16:21.820
new type of tiles, new type of bathrooms.

16:27.207 --> 16:33.379
If you go to an American house,
better ask about the bathroom,

16:39.508 --> 16:41.955
otherwise when you enter in, maybe,

16:42.155 --> 16:46.851
you may be just drenched with
water with some showers falling on you.

16:51.411 --> 16:56.540
Or you may sit in the tub, and you may
press it and the whole tub might come like that.

17:00.145 --> 17:06.145
Their beds are also funny; you may press
on some button and the whole bed may come up.

17:12.304 --> 17:16.978
They have beds where they just
can fold on this part, or that part –

17:17.179 --> 17:23.380
it is terrible, I mean if you press some buttons,
you might be going into acrobats all the time.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.588
There is no need to do all that.

17:34.754 --> 17:39.380
But when you have out-of-proportion
machineries, then you have to do it,

17:45.650 --> 17:50.617
but that is how you become
slaves of these entrepreneurs.

17:56.371 --> 17:59.701
But in Sahaja Yoga, when you come in,

18:01.970 --> 18:04.900
you know how to do living work.

18:09.677 --> 18:13.874
Like in the affluent countries,

18:14.074 --> 18:18.140
they use seeds which are hybrid.

18:24.051 --> 18:26.144
Hybrid.

18:31.837 --> 18:36.526
These hybrid seeds are of no nourishment to us,

18:36.727 --> 18:39.540
they are no good for our brains, they confuse us.

18:47.091 --> 18:52.620
Especially the hybrid animals,
their milk confuses us.

18:59.312 --> 19:02.740
Hybrid animals themselves are very confused.

19:07.220 --> 19:10.105
But in Sahaja Yoga,

19:10.306 --> 19:14.049
you take the ordinary seeds

19:18.569 --> 19:21.115
and you vibrate them.

19:22.226 --> 19:25.694
If you vibrate them, then what happens,

19:25.895 --> 19:33.895
that you start getting seeds
which are even better than hybrid.

19:41.909 --> 19:47.140
I tried an experiment with a sunflower.

19:51.815 --> 19:56.140
So, I developed a sunflower about 2 kilos weight,

19:59.707 --> 20:02.940
about one foot diameter,

20:07.233 --> 20:11.980
and such big, big seeds that you can’t
make them out to be sunflower seeds.

20:18.689 --> 20:22.860
So the collective was so amazed at it,

20:26.185 --> 20:31.140
and they felt that this
kind of seed will solve all our oil problem.

20:35.941 --> 20:39.043
Same thing happens with the animals.

20:41.296 --> 20:45.460
You take an ordinary cow, Indian ordinary cow,

20:50.198 --> 20:53.380
and you give her vibrated water to drink,

20:56.588 --> 21:02.500
and she gives
about the same milk as an Australian cow.

21:08.808 --> 21:13.820
But the Australian cow’s milk
can make you confused and mad

21:20.722 --> 21:25.820
because we have seen that the Australian cows,

21:26.020 --> 21:32.151
when they are in India, they don’t know
where they stand, they just run amok,

21:40.477 --> 21:43.312
so what must be their milk?

21:45.309 --> 21:51.900
But an Indian cow, if she gets
realization through this vibrated water,

21:52.100 --> 21:55.900
she gives milk which is very good for the brain.

22:07.050 --> 22:13.378
So that is how we improve the
quality of our animals by Sahaja Yoga.

22:21.272 --> 22:24.649
Now regarding matter, we have to understand

22:24.849 --> 22:28.740
that matter is only good for giving it to others,

22:37.260 --> 22:40.900
but if it is given by a realized soul,

22:43.999 --> 22:46.499
it has tremendous effects.

22:50.399 --> 22:54.820
Before Gregoire wanted to write
his book, I gave him a fountain pen,

23:03.059 --> 23:08.020
and he said, “I never
wrote a book,” and he started writing so well.

23:15.172 --> 23:18.860
Same with Rustom; he became a scholar.

23:23.449 --> 23:27.300
So, Sahaja Yoga gives you

23:38.506 --> 23:41.670
an additional power

23:47.484 --> 23:52.708
by which you can neutralize
the bad effects of materialism.

23:58.898 --> 24:05.460
Now, say, supposing in India, in England,

24:05.965 --> 24:09.340
you have to offer drinks to people.

24:15.427 --> 24:18.740
So there are ten types of
glasses you have to have.

24:24.768 --> 24:27.416
Only one is sufficient

24:28.368 --> 24:32.180
to drink anything;
why to have ten? It’s a headache.

24:37.544 --> 24:42.002
Now if you have to use spoons and
forks, then you have all elaborations,

24:42.202 --> 24:45.900
and you can have a ten-place setting.

24:52.709 --> 24:56.340
But if you can use your
hands, they are very clean—

25:00.990 --> 25:04.169
need not have so many elaborations.

25:06.587 --> 25:10.175
But these elaborations we
have not because we want them,

25:10.375 --> 25:14.700
but because of these
entrepreneurs – they force on us.

25:22.829 --> 25:26.078
But there is a deeper influence:

25:28.703 --> 25:32.535
how people control you through matter.

25:36.638 --> 25:40.700
Now, supposing they go to somebody’s house,

25:44.380 --> 25:51.049
and they find a kind of a spoon missing –
because there could be a spoon for avocado,

25:51.249 --> 25:54.140
say, a special spoon for avocado.

25:59.884 --> 26:02.855
Now if that spoon is not there, they will say,

26:03.055 --> 26:07.413
“Oh, these people have no sense,”

26:13.112 --> 26:17.460
and they will ask:
“Have you got a spoon for avocado?”

26:23.652 --> 26:27.468
So it is very shameless and it is very arrogant,

26:31.071 --> 26:33.906
to insult another person.

26:36.348 --> 26:41.436
A housewife, supposing you are a guest,

26:41.636 --> 26:45.620
she will be more worried about
her carpet than about her guests.

26:53.520 --> 26:59.340
And this kind of a thing can go too
far, and a person can become very dry.

27:05.436 --> 27:10.004
Such people are very disgusting

27:12.993 --> 27:17.703
and insulting type, an insulting.

27:21.955 --> 27:26.270
There is another way they
control you through matter,

27:30.377 --> 27:35.328
that they will say that

27:36.047 --> 27:40.983
now you have to say, for a husband,

27:41.183 --> 27:45.580
“You must get me this,
otherwise I will be very angry.”

27:52.294 --> 27:56.980
If the husband breaks one
cup, the wife will be on his head,

28:04.012 --> 28:07.260
as if the cup is more important than the husband.

28:10.593 --> 28:14.907
She can get another husband,
she can also get another cup.

28:18.548 --> 28:23.940
See, the whole human dignity is reduced to matter,

28:29.695 --> 28:32.900
and this kind of controlling goes on.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.606
Children also control parents.

28:41.893 --> 28:47.780
They see on the television some
sort of a toy, and they ask the parents.

28:53.698 --> 28:57.541
Now if the parents don’t give
the toy, they will not eat their food.

29:02.951 --> 29:06.620
They’ll cry and weep and trouble the parents.

29:09.689 --> 29:13.340
So then the parents: “All right,
get them the toy, let them have it.”

29:16.289 --> 29:20.289
And the child plays with
the toy, not with the parents.

29:24.803 --> 29:30.126
Now two friends will meet, and they’ll
say, “We must go and see a film together.”

29:33.482 --> 29:37.740
They don’t talk to each other,
there’s no rapport, there’s no friendship.

29:41.510 --> 29:44.660
They must have something in between them.

29:47.517 --> 29:51.330
There is no direct rapport between
the children, between the friends,

29:51.531 --> 29:54.173
between husband and wife.

30:00.795 --> 30:03.780
Matter is to beautify your life,

30:06.737 --> 30:09.432
not to make it ugly

30:11.893 --> 30:15.020
and create problems between each other.

30:18.906 --> 30:22.056
Now the French will not like the English

30:22.257 --> 30:27.300
because they use their fork
and knives in a different way.

30:35.195 --> 30:38.461
And the English think no end of themselves

30:38.662 --> 30:41.695
because they know the English language.

30:47.725 --> 30:53.780
All this kind of nonsensical feelings
come in through this kind of materialism,

31:00.503 --> 31:03.300
and we are no more collective,

31:05.179 --> 31:08.140
and the collectivity gets lost.

31:09.914 --> 31:15.473
But then we find out wrong
methods to get into collectivity.

31:22.241 --> 31:24.989
Like, we take to alcoholism,

31:25.190 --> 31:30.705
because after alcohol we feel abandoned
and we can laugh and enjoy together.

31:38.639 --> 31:42.820
So, otherwise, if not, we go for holiday.

31:46.231 --> 31:49.100
All the women must show off their body

31:51.729 --> 31:54.340
to attract the attention of men.

31:57.329 --> 32:01.940
Men must show off their bodies
to attract the attention of women,

32:05.811 --> 32:08.311
but no one knows, no one

32:12.709 --> 32:15.396
– it’s a joyless pursuit.

32:18.823 --> 32:23.420
And the way they quarrel among
themselves for all these small, small things,

32:23.620 --> 32:26.291
they are really joy-killers.

32:33.434 --> 32:37.900
As a result of all these
things, we have lost the art,

32:39.185 --> 32:42.044
we have lost the art,

32:46.091 --> 32:51.185
we have lost the deftness, the deftness;

32:54.081 --> 32:59.281
and now wherever you go, what you find ugly things

32:59.600 --> 33:06.107
like the airport of Charles de Gaulle

33:13.834 --> 33:19.090
— it looks like a factory, and I don’t
know how you feel in that place.

33:23.153 --> 33:26.540
There is no cosiness in the household;

33:31.615 --> 33:35.460
the house is so bare and so insipid,

33:37.901 --> 33:40.947
and the people are so dry and stupid.

33:43.277 --> 33:47.536
There’s no joy in the family, so also
the children run away from the houses

33:47.736 --> 33:52.805
at the age of eighteen,
or sixteen, whatever may be the case.

33:58.578 --> 34:02.740
So instead of human beings,
we start creating robots, you see,

34:06.807 --> 34:09.420
controlled by entrepreneurs.

34:12.049 --> 34:16.496
This is the situation.
That’s why you play into the hands

34:16.696 --> 34:22.220
of all kinds of things like
psychologists, like Freud.

34:29.878 --> 34:33.300
Any new idea comes in, they jump at it,

34:37.171 --> 34:42.540
and that’s how they suffer – the
result is they have got AIDS now.

34:47.872 --> 34:51.020
There’s no logic in their heads.

34:52.930 --> 34:58.141
They don’t understand
that this is just exploitation.

35:00.881 --> 35:05.340
After Sahaja Yoga, you do
understand this is exploitation.

35:10.047 --> 35:13.460
Now they have plastics and nylons,

35:16.605 --> 35:22.380
and they don’t know what to do
with the plastic, how to get rid of it.

35:26.243 --> 35:30.780
Then they have acid rains, acid rains

35:34.597 --> 35:41.180
and the trees are affected by that.

35:48.438 --> 35:54.340
Now in Switzerland—which is
such a corrupt country, I should say,

35:54.540 --> 35:59.340
it is taking the money, corrupt
money, from every country

36:05.498 --> 36:08.810
—who are absolute materialists

36:11.731 --> 36:14.500
are suffering from this acid rain.

36:19.024 --> 36:21.900
Most of their trees are destroyed

36:24.824 --> 36:31.456
and they have avalanches. All these
big, big mountains that they have,

36:32.050 --> 36:37.173
the ice starts flowing downward
because nobody can hold it,

36:43.317 --> 36:45.910
and now there are floods.

36:48.866 --> 36:52.499
The nature starts acting.

36:57.104 --> 37:03.100
So, whether they progress
outward in this wrong direction,

37:03.736 --> 37:10.380
or they try things inwards like Freudian methods

37:10.895 --> 37:13.540
– both are dangerous

37:25.716 --> 37:28.261
and are destructive,

37:29.468 --> 37:31.978
and in this destruction,

37:32.179 --> 37:37.054
who are lost are the people who are innocent.

37:44.054 --> 37:48.460
So, one has to develop that wisdom within oneself,

37:51.843 --> 37:57.540
that we are human beings here,
part and parcel of one whole,

38:05.224 --> 38:11.220
and only the human beings can get
Self-Realization and can feel that oneness.

38:19.420 --> 38:23.740
And such a personality is a satisfied personality.

38:27.206 --> 38:30.620
They do not try to exploit other countries,

38:32.929 --> 38:35.660
other people;

38:36.008 --> 38:38.508
they live satisfied with themselves.

38:41.461 --> 38:45.340
They enjoy their compassion and their generosity.

38:48.133 --> 38:51.140
They open their houses to everyone,

38:53.566 --> 38:56.860
they open their hearts to everyone.

38:58.675 --> 39:02.955
They make their houses beautiful
for others, not for themselves.

39:08.299 --> 39:12.300
We were first in London in a country house,

39:14.731 --> 39:17.460
and there were six other houses;

39:19.731 --> 39:22.750
there were quite rich people living there.

39:25.562 --> 39:29.517
Every Saturday, Sunday, the
poor husband had to mow the lawn,

39:29.717 --> 39:34.740
and the wife would stand
up, telling him, “Do it better,”

39:42.627 --> 39:48.460
and used to polish all the brass, you see.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.925
Same with his wife.

39:57.581 --> 40:03.460
And not even a rat would enter that house.

40:06.785 --> 40:10.460
And they were surprised that in our house

40:15.706 --> 40:18.500
there were so many people coming.

40:20.481 --> 40:26.300
And they came and saw our house and
were surprised that our house was so beautiful

40:26.500 --> 40:29.460
and so neat and clean.

40:36.847 --> 40:41.180
I told them that if you
really have a beautiful house,

40:41.380 --> 40:44.020
even children don’t want to disturb it;

40:50.828 --> 40:53.980
they treat the house like a temple.

40:56.382 --> 41:02.860
But if you do not make the house
beautiful and acceptable to others,

41:08.215 --> 41:13.553
then you are only busy
cleaning for yourself all the brass,

41:13.753 --> 41:18.740
all the crystal, all the
glass, everything yourself.

41:29.423 --> 41:31.700
And what is the purpose?

41:32.719 --> 41:36.420
Then Monday you are
again tired, sitting very tired,

41:40.409 --> 41:44.980
but if you had kept the doors open
to others, they would have enjoyed.

41:49.671 --> 41:52.671
Then it had some purpose.

41:54.461 --> 41:58.420
So purposeless life is absolutely joyless.

42:03.674 --> 42:10.020
That is the problem, is that people
get exhausted for nonsensical things.

42:17.665 --> 42:22.820
If one spoon is lost,
they will just die ten times.

42:28.699 --> 42:33.419
Thank God, in India, we are not
such materialists—yet, we might.

42:36.722 --> 42:40.220
We might become but can't say.

42:40.482 --> 42:45.940
but we have now a short circuit: we are
coming to Sahaja Yoga before we are developing.

42:53.225 --> 42:57.295
Now the culture is also very
different and is an ancient culture.

43:01.590 --> 43:07.433
That should be the culture of
Sahaja Yogis – will be that culture.

43:15.086 --> 43:20.500
Like, now, if somebody spills any coffee say,

43:21.075 --> 43:25.288
nobody will say anything—“Oh it’s all right,
it’s all right, no, no, no it doesn’t matter”

43:25.488 --> 43:28.140
—even if it’s a Persian carpet.

43:35.699 --> 43:39.380
Until the guest is in the
house, you will not wipe it.

43:43.839 --> 43:46.997
Even if children break
something, we don’t punish them,

43:47.197 --> 43:51.700
that: “You have broken this and it’s
very wrong, you have broken that.”

43:51.900 --> 43:55.340
Nothing of the kind. “It’s all
right, you be careful” – that’s all.

44:01.118 --> 44:03.380
We don’t scold them for that,

44:06.852 --> 44:11.100
but we tell them that, “You
be careful, you might get hurt.”

44:13.570 --> 44:16.570
No importance is given to things.

44:18.896 --> 44:23.220
Also, in language, we cannot
say to somebody: “I hate you.”

44:28.326 --> 44:30.980
That’s not allowed.

44:31.492 --> 44:34.420
Or “I don’t like you,”

44:35.893 --> 44:38.393
or “I believe in this.”

44:39.739 --> 44:42.239
They will say: “Who are you?

44:43.798 --> 44:46.300
What do you think of yourself?”

44:47.125 --> 44:49.900
The parents will immediately correct,

44:54.169 --> 44:58.185
and that is the correcting point
which helps throughout the life.

44:58.386 --> 45:03.020
You don’t say harsh things like:
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

45:11.446 --> 45:14.313
We have to appreciate everything:

45:17.535 --> 45:20.180
learn to appreciate other human beings,

45:23.590 --> 45:26.090
to enjoy other people,

45:28.327 --> 45:30.827
to see to their good points.

45:33.004 --> 45:38.580
If you see only their bad points, you will
get all their bad points. Where is your attention?

45:44.905 --> 45:50.580
Instead of getting too many plastics,
you have one little nice thing with you.

45:56.842 --> 45:59.660
That is something joy-giving.

46:03.133 --> 46:05.780
Keep your houses open to others.

46:08.894 --> 46:12.220
Don’t get worried how your door is

46:12.420 --> 46:17.255
– if somebody touches the door it
might spoil its polish or something like that.

46:23.436 --> 46:27.873
Enjoy looking after others,
having concern for them.

46:32.637 --> 46:38.220
They always say, “Mother, You look so
young despite Your age and You work so hard.”

46:44.513 --> 46:48.834
It is because I love everyone
much more than I care for Myself

46:54.502 --> 46:57.740
because I have so much concern for everyone.

47:00.205 --> 47:02.705
That keeps Me very happy.

47:04.615 --> 47:08.500
If I could give something to
others, that makes Me very happy.

47:12.778 --> 47:17.660
If I can cook for everyone, that’s very good.

47:22.266 --> 47:27.437
Only, I think, two years back, I went to

47:29.638 --> 47:32.015
– that’s about three years back

47:32.215 --> 47:37.521
– I went to Australia and cooked for
five hundred people in two places

47:43.367 --> 47:49.300
and enjoyed really seeing them enjoy My food.

47:52.398 --> 47:54.980
It was such a joy-giving thing.

47:57.218 --> 48:00.700
The greatest joy is in giving others.

48:03.786 --> 48:06.592
As soon as this attitude changes,

48:06.792 --> 48:11.822
you’ll be amazed the
materialism will be at your feet

48:18.521 --> 48:23.376
because in Sahaja Yoga it works that way.

48:26.673 --> 48:29.700
I’ll give you an example.

48:30.400 --> 48:33.683
Once I was going for a Guru Puja,

48:33.883 --> 48:39.274
and I wanted to take some
presents for all the leaders.

48:46.104 --> 48:52.465
In London, I don’t go out shopping, but I went
out, and I was exhausted. I couldn’t get anything,

48:58.196 --> 49:03.660
and I came in the evening very
tired and there was nothing I could find,

49:08.375 --> 49:14.580
and I thought that, I better now open My
storeroom and try to find out something there.

49:20.186 --> 49:26.420
And at that time, a Sahaja Yogi just said, “Mother
there’s some boy who wants to sell his paintings.”

49:34.002 --> 49:37.100
I just came rushing down,

49:39.464 --> 49:43.220
and he had beautiful paintings with him

49:45.295 --> 49:49.180
at a very reasonable price that I could afford,

49:52.755 --> 49:55.820
and they were exactly the number I wanted.

49:59.363 --> 50:05.500
So I bought them, and you know in one of the
Guru pujas I gave beautiful paintings to everyone.

50:12.832 --> 50:16.260
This time I had no time to buy any presents

50:16.460 --> 50:20.740
for the leaders; I was going to France and here.

50:28.017 --> 50:31.820
I thought, I must have
something and now what to do?

50:36.535 --> 50:43.300
I have to take something for
Jose Antonio and also for Patrick.

50:47.643 --> 50:50.340
So, our plane was delayed,

50:53.180 --> 50:57.420
and I got beautiful
fountain pens for both of them.

51:02.245 --> 51:05.838
I was so very happy I could buy them there.

51:07.960 --> 51:10.970
It’s so nice, you see, to buy for others.

51:14.037 --> 51:17.260
I find it difficult to buy anything for Myself.

51:21.515 --> 51:28.260
It is so many times I have seen how
suddenly you get the things that you want,

51:34.740 --> 51:37.940
as the matter is at your feet.

51:41.130 --> 51:44.082
I had bought some chocolates for the children

51:44.283 --> 51:50.820
for the puja in – not puja, but visit to Paris,

51:55.847 --> 52:00.580
and when they came in the
evening for music, we forgot about it.

52:06.295 --> 52:09.260
But at the airport we suddenly found them,

52:12.654 --> 52:17.780
so I gave all that to small
children and to big children also,

52:22.360 --> 52:25.140
and we had a nice time at the airport.

52:26.996 --> 52:32.300
All these small, small things give
so much of joy, such an ocean of joy!

52:37.101 --> 52:39.830
You just try these things.

52:43.635 --> 52:46.780
In the beginning of Sahaj Yoga,

52:47.556 --> 52:53.225
I had gone for a program to meet
the Sahaja Yogis at Gavin’s place,

53:00.674 --> 53:02.806
At Gavin's place.

53:04.761 --> 53:08.778
and his wife was no good for
– she was cooking and all that,

53:08.978 --> 53:11.831
she was schizophrenic type,

53:16.597 --> 53:20.500
but Gavin said, “Mother, will you
please have Your dinner with us?”

53:24.817 --> 53:28.063
So I thought, he has cooked only for Me,

53:31.444 --> 53:35.140
so I allowed everybody to go away,

53:38.301 --> 53:40.900
and he was in the kitchen.

53:42.170 --> 53:45.063
He came out and said, “Mother, where are they?”

53:50.706 --> 53:53.500
I said, “Why? They have gone away.”

53:55.989 --> 53:59.540
He said, “See, Mother,
I have cooked for all of them,

53:59.740 --> 54:02.240
and why did they go away?”

54:04.675 --> 54:11.153
You see, his sweetness filled my heart with joy;

54:16.931 --> 54:20.863
I felt what a sweet man he is.

54:24.023 --> 54:28.626
He’s from Scotland, and they say
that Scottish people are very miserly,

54:28.835 --> 54:32.620
but I found Gavin to be a very generous person.

54:39.913 --> 54:43.936
Like that, I like when the
Sahaja Yogis talk good of others,

54:44.136 --> 54:48.263
try to help them, and try
to be nice to each other.

54:48.463 --> 54:51.380
That is the most joy-giving thing.

54:57.837 --> 55:02.719
All these things will cut out
the domination of matter upon us.

55:07.520 --> 55:10.340
We should not care for the matter.

55:12.711 --> 55:17.922
Of course, one should care for
something that is given to you with love.

55:23.100 --> 55:28.580
One day Gregoire had
given Me two little, little horses.

55:32.952 --> 55:36.060
Then I came home, I saw they were missing,

55:39.697 --> 55:44.220
and I went round the whole house seeing them:
“Where are they?” I said, “Where are they gone?”

55:46.693 --> 55:49.882
So I had My servants,
My domestics; they were surprised,

55:50.082 --> 55:54.780
that: “There are so many things in the house,
why is She worried about these two little horses?”

56:02.260 --> 56:05.153
So, My husband came back in the evening.

56:05.353 --> 56:09.580
I said, “Have you seen those two little
horses that Gregoire had given Me?”

56:15.621 --> 56:21.779
“Yes, yes,” he said. “I have kept them properly
in my cupboard because children were there,

56:21.980 --> 56:25.565
they would have broken and
You would have felt bad about them.”

56:30.943 --> 56:35.780
I had so much silver, so many
expensive things—he didn’t bother about that,

56:40.253 --> 56:44.060
because it had an expression of love in that,

56:48.103 --> 56:52.775
which is much more than all the
gold and all the silver put together.

56:58.655 --> 57:03.820
This is what we have to understand,
that love is more important than anything else.

57:08.504 --> 57:11.780
You must compete in loving each other more,

57:16.113 --> 57:20.020
compete in being kind to each other,

57:24.251 --> 57:27.892
and compete in being humbler to each other,

57:31.459 --> 57:36.820
compete in doing something for others,

57:41.801 --> 57:45.420
and in saying very sweet things to others.

57:50.401 --> 57:54.660
Try to think of doing something very sweet.

57:59.296 --> 58:03.993
Like once I went to buy a
sari for Myself and then I found

58:04.194 --> 58:06.506
– you see, for Myself I am quite miserly;

58:06.707 --> 58:10.732
I thought it was rather
expensive and I didn’t buy it.

58:22.789 --> 58:26.471
And another Sahaja Yogi was there,

58:26.671 --> 58:30.878
with Me, I didn’t know, but he bought that sari,

58:36.547 --> 58:40.180
and the next day he brought it to Me as a present.

58:44.083 --> 58:46.780
You don’t know the joy I felt

58:48.675 --> 58:52.140
because I know I’m very miserly about Myself,

58:57.901 --> 59:02.220
and then that sari was so
much appreciated by everyone.

59:06.600 --> 59:09.100
Maybe it had that love.

59:12.654 --> 59:18.260
This is what it is: we
have to feel the power of love,

59:23.108 --> 59:26.540
then everything vibrates, the matter vibrates,

59:30.333 --> 59:34.575
and you can feel the vibrations from a distance.

59:38.999 --> 59:43.087
If you come and open My cupboard

59:43.288 --> 59:47.578
and try to arrange My saris,
you will be all filled with vibrations.

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:03.340
Anything that you touch will have vibrations.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:13.140
So, it is important that we should
learn to love and improve our vibrations

01:00:19.019 --> 01:00:22.740
so that we can spread love all over

01:00:26.572 --> 01:00:32.500
and remove the people from
the shackles of materialism.

01:00:39.362 --> 01:00:45.500
I wanted to talk to people in Spain
about this, and for all the other people,

01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:50.838
I would say that they should come back

01:00:51.283 --> 01:00:54.186
because they have gone too far into it,

01:01:04.881 --> 01:01:07.460
because matter complicates you.

01:01:10.035 --> 01:01:12.820
It reacts and makes you think more.

01:01:16.121 --> 01:01:19.371
It doesn’t allow your
attention to be steady.

01:01:21.955 --> 01:01:26.220
If you see anything beautiful,
you just look at it without thinking,

01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:38.326
then you will realize
what beauty lies in the matter.

01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:48.260
In the Zen system of meditation,

01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:54.940
Vidhitama, the one who was
the founder of Zen system, tried it.

01:02:02.194 --> 01:02:05.637
I think I’ve talked about it in some other lecture.

01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:17.980
With all My love to you, I
would say that try to love each other.

01:02:24.686 --> 01:02:29.845
And you have seen that, in India
when you travel, it’s not so comfortable

01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:38.932
and we cannot give that
comfort in the small places we go to,

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:47.060
but still, you all enjoy it so much.

01:02:51.407 --> 01:02:54.699
You don’t want comfort,
you want the comfort of love.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:01.598
You enjoy each other’s company so much

01:03:03.668 --> 01:03:10.580
and that overflowing love of your
host country that is India, Indians.

01:03:16.842 --> 01:03:20.220
That is the sign of good Sahaja Yogis.

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.780
Because there is a big purpose in our lives

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.510
– greatest of all.

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:42.300
What Abraham Lincoln did,
or what Mahatma Gandhi did,

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:46.340
your work is much greater and subtler,

01:03:55.812 --> 01:03:58.380
because you can do living work.

01:04:01.062 --> 01:04:04.020
So, we don’t have to become sanyasis,

01:04:05.719 --> 01:04:08.219
we don’t have to give up anything,

01:04:10.286 --> 01:04:13.500
but we have to change our attitude.

01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:19.371
We have to develop that detachment.

01:04:21.835 --> 01:04:24.527
May God bless you all.
