[APPLAUSE ON SHRI MATAJI'S ARRIVAL]

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.280
[APPLAUSE ON SHRI MATAJI'S ARRIVAL]

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.180
[APPLAUSE ON SHRI MATAJI'S ARRIVAL]

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.800
[HINDI - Kya bataya inhonne?] What did you tell? What did you tell?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.440
[UNCLEAR] told about a little bit about Sahaja yoga in terms of how valuable is Sahaja yoga

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.760
because he talked about, little bit about innocence and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.600
Muladhara chakra - quality of Muladhara chakra - innocence

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.940
and he told it that sahaja yoga was like, 40,000 years ago available

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.220
known and few saints only in the past know and could give realizations etc.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.340
- Haan, thank
- Jai shri Mataji
- Thank,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.280
thank you very much. Come, come.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.040
Thank you. Bachchon ko I cured them. Thank you.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.880
- Yeah, how are you?
- Yes, Shri Ma

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.400
- How are these children?
- [RUSSIAN]
- How is he now?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.980
[RUSSIAN] Nirmal

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.300
Thank you very much

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.640
- Thank you. Was he, how is he now?
- [RUSSIAN]

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.340
[RUSSIAN] It's alright, so so.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.100
- But what was his.....
- [RUSSIAN]

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.780
- [RUSSIAN]
- Throat problem.
- He came to Me last night.
- Yes, yes Mother, he was here

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.300
- He's better now, he's talking
- [RUSSIAN]

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.140
- Oh yes, he speaks little bit better.
- Alright, I'll see you after the program
- [RUSSIAN]

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.460
You made.... thank you, thank you.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.200
All these children were sick last time.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.320
- Where are you now?
- Where you saying Mother. Here is my mic [UNCLEAR]

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.560
- Just
- Where should I sit?
- No, sit there, it's alright.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.300
- Like that
- Alright.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.620
Like that [UNCLEAR]

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.660
He's alright?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.620
Russian news, Mother - these people are from Russian news and they follow the Russian newspapers.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.220
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.560
As I told you last time that Truth is what it is.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.040
You cannot do lip service about it

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.860
and you cannot have any pretentions about it.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.480
Truth has to be felt on your Central Nervous System.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.760
As you can clearly see this platform

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.780
made of different colors - clearly see it

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.500
and as you can feel the heat of the candles,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.040
you have to feel the Truth

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.820
on your finger-tips.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.180
I mean, on your Central Nervous System.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.400
It is not empty talk.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.380
- [INTERPRETER]
- It is something that has to happen to you.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:53.460
It is the actualization of the experience of the Spirit.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:01.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.640
- This arrangement is within us already made.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.840
So far, we have believed in everything blindly.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.600
We believe in all kinds of political arrangements

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:38.780
but all those arrangements, whether it is democracy, communism, anything has failed completely, everywhere.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.960
You should never think that you are the only people who are suffering

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.540
but everywhere, whatever systems they have followed,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.320
all of them are suffering in different ways.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:17.880
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.400
They sacrifice so much to achieve their freedom.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.140
They went to jail and so many died and so many were killed

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.800
but what they achieve is the outside freedom

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:46.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.100
- [INTERPRETER]
- but inside they're not free.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.940
- [INTERPRETER]
- They're slaves of alcoholism,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.860
- slaves of drugs,
- [INTERPRETER]
- slaves of drugs,

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:16.540
- slaves of sex diseases.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:24.200
They are suffering much more than you people can suffer.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.540
You people look so healthy to Me, much better, much wiser

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.300
but in their freedom, without

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:56.420
any control of the Spirit, they have become idiotic.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:05.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:12.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:20.920
- So we have to achieve our inner freedom -
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.680
- the freedom of totality
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.580
where we are so strong enough that nothing can dominate us.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.880
[INTERPRETER]

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:45.760
- [INTERPRETER]
- At human level it is not possible

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.480
- whatever you may try,
- [INTERPRETER]
- whatever experiments you take over,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:04.140
- [INTERPRETER]
- everything is futile

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.820
- [INTERPRETER]
- as if it boomerangs.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.340
For every action which is

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.100
on one side, has the polarity on the other.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.760
- So, you have to come in the center
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:53.280
to, to know actually through Absolute Truth what is benevolent for you.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:02.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.080
Not just by reading, not by talking but

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.360
actually happening to you is the important point

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.880
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:28.820
- and that is what is sahaja yog.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.420
It's actually true that we are human-beings and not animals.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.800
In the same way, it should be actually true that we are

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.880
spiritual people, that we are enlightened souls,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.980
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.100
so that we do not suffer from the polarity of, so called, freedom.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.200
Our own system is built-in like that.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:28.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:35.560
The system is built in us gradually during our evolutionary process.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:43.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:51.720
Like, this instrument is built-in but if it is not connected to the mains, doesn't serve it's purpose.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:59.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:11.280
In sahaja yoga, you get connected with the All-Pervading subtle

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.700
power which is for our ascent and benevolence.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:24.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:31.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.940
It is important to understand that we have come in this world not to suffer

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.060
but in the darkness of ignorance we do suffer.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:57.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:06.680
- All over the world they are suffering
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.160
- this way or that way.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:18.740
So, it is important that we should do some introspection and find out

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.100
what is the reason.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.640
When you start doing that, the seeking for Truth starts.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:42.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.320
- That is the beginning of sahaja yoga.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.520
You believe in God or don't believe in God makes no difference.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:59.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.540
You believe in any religion or in no religion, makes no difference

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.540
because both things are done blindly.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:22.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.760
- It is a blind faith
- [INTERPRETER]
- and a blind is leading another blind.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:41.220
- One, he'll say is that, "Believe in God."
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:48.700
- but on what grounds is he saying that?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.800
- Another says, "Don't believe in God,"
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.520
but is very unscientific; He has not found out whether there is God or not God.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:08.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:16.220
- So, both are blind.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:24.200
- So no use following blind people -
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.180
only way is to get enlightenment.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:36.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:43.860
In the light of the Spirit, you can see everything very clearly and you can feel everything.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.800
As some of you know that sahaja yoga gives you the actual experience

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.120
of the All-Pervading Power

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.420
- but how does it work out?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:24.760
As you have been told already, that we have within ourselves the power

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.300
to connect ourselves to that All-Pervading Power.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.920
You should not also believe Me blindly.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:53.200
- [INTERPRETER]
- Till you have not experienced it, you should not believe Me.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:00.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.580
But you have to keep your mind open to see that if

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:12.940
this experience comes true then, as a honest person you have to accept it

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:30.680
- because it is for your benevolence.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.720
- Nature has planned it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.860
and now the time has come for all of you to get your enlightenment

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:50.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:55.140
It is just like your evolutionary process, a living process.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:05.380
As you know, that you have become human-beings from amoeba stage

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:12.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:21.320
and if you have to go further, it has to be a living process.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:28.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:37.380
- Sahaja means, born with you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.320
and yoga means the union with this All-Pervading Power.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.940
So, every human-being has a right to be united with that All-Pervading Power.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:02.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.780
We see these flowers - they have come out of a single seed.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:15.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.280
We see so many miracles of the living power

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.040
See our eye - is such a great camera!

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:44.320
The whole body, itself, is such a beautiful combination of balance

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:52.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.800
as if our brain is also programmed.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.460
So now, in this process of sahaja yoga,

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.860
the evolutionary power makes you a computer

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:19.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.800
and you become the Absolute Truth.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.180
- You know it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.420
and then you can also handle this power the way you like.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:53.200
The greatest thing about this power is, that this is the power of

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.080
compassion, of love.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:14.660
So far, we have only used the power of hatred anywhere.... hatred.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:21.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.100
We have to now use the power of love, of Pure Love.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.440
But this happening cannot be forced on anyone.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:51.000
- You cannot
- [INTERPRETER]
- dominate anyone

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.000
- [INTERPRETER]

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:01.560
by which you can achieve the awakening.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:08.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:15.120
- Your freedom is respected
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.880
because you have to be totally free

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:25.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.800
and then the blessings of this All-Pervading power

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.880
you start feeling and you feel it's all miraculous.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.900
Then the inner religion is awakened

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:55.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:03.100
- and you become a righteous person.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.580
You're not to be told, "Don't do this, don't do that," - it just happens

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:14.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:20.060
because the light of your Spirit

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:27.340
tells you or you know in the light of Spirit what is good for you

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:36.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:44.440
and you yourself become so powerful in life, that nothing can dominate you.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.840
So this power, which is All-Pervading, thinks,

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.800
it coordinates, it cooperates and it organizes.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:17.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:24.760
- Above all, it loves.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:32.240
- So, it forgives all the time
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:39.780
because it wants you to rise into that realm of Self-realization.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:47.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:53.120
- It is so anxious.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:59.000
Formerly, only one master could have only one disciple

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.980
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.660
and the knowledge of Kundalini was never exposed to the public

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:16.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.000
and first time in the 12th century, Gyaneshwara wrote about it.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:28.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.200
This knowledge was not to be told to the public but today

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.900
the public or the masses have to get it.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:47.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.780
Even reading about the knowledge, becomes just book knowledge.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:01.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:07.900
- People become bookworms.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:15.200
Whatever book they may read, whatever religion they may follow, all of them can do any kind of sin.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:22.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:30.800
They can kill anybody, they can destroy anyone - they can do what they like; There is no binding force on them.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:48.200
What I know about Russians is that, that all their authors,

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:55.640
whether they were writing novels or philosophies or anything, have been full of introspection.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:04.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:12.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:19.320
This shows that you people have a special quality to introspect.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:27.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:34.700
- It does not come from intelligence
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:41.560
- because intelligence can cheat itself.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:49.440
- You can rationalize anything
- [INTERPRETER]
- because it is all mental.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:00.980
So, one has to know that it is the wisdom that is important.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:15.760
I don't know but I feel the word Russia itself comes from two words is Ra-Sa.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.900
Rasa - Ras means, 'Ra' means energy, 'Sa' means with energy

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.860
'Ra' means energy, 'Sa' means with, with

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.920
Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:43.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.500
and the energy of love is 'Ra'.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:59.180
- The All-Pervading Power is 'Ra'
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.200
and in our local language 'Rasiya'

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.540
means a person who's beloved - who's a beloved.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:16.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:31.500
I think, this name must have come because the people in this country have that

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.740
special position to achieve that power.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:46.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:54.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:00.780
I've got great hopes for you. I've got great hopes for you.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:07.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:15.580
You can really lead the world into it's emancipation

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:23.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.860
- but you must have some patience
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.840
and I'm sure, you will realize how important you are to Me.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:44.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:51.500
- This is a new type of a revolution
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.600
and for this revolution, you are the best suited people.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:02.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.720
Tomorrow, I'll tell you more, in details, about the Spirit

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:14.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.240
but in any cases I would love to have some questions from you

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:31.840
and then, we can have session of Self-realization, which will take about ten minutes.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.300
- Questions, Mother, should I take questions?
- Yeah.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.640
Dear Shri Mataji, I am a teacher in Russian language

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.900
[UNCLEAR] Moscow [UNCLEAR]

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:29.620
I, one year ago my left hand began to shake and I cannot work.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:36.060
- Can you help me please to release from this sickness?
- Alright.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:52.800
All those who are asking for getting their sickness to be cured

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.680
is very simple to get them [UNCLEAR]

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.860
Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:17.120
but for that you have to attend the Sahaja yoga practices.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:26.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.580
It's no use just listening to My class.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:43.840
All of you, who get realization, must attend the practices of Sahaja yoga.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:51.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.600
You may be cured by Me today but again you'll develop another trouble.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:06.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.880
Not only physical - mental, emotional, any trouble you might get it.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:18.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:25.020
So, those who are asking for their cure, I have to request them

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:33.180
that, luckily, we have here Dr. Baghdan, who can look after you and we have Dr. Kaleena,

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.420
who is [UNCLEAR - PREPARED?] to many doctors - they would like to help you out.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:46.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:54.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:00.840
Today, I must have met, at least, four five, four hundred doctors

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:09.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:16.980
- and they're very open-hearted;
- [INTERPRETER]
- They all can help you

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:24.280
- [INTERPRETER]
- So please, just after My

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:30.020
departure, you should know that you have to grow yourself.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.720
Not only that you'll be cured, but you'll have powers to cure others.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:53.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.740
So please, those who have now asked for curing,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.820
I would say, that we will see you afterwards.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.980
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.720
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:29.240
Dear Shri Mataji, "I'm putting Your [UNCLEAR] my children and I are not

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.000
we are not by church, say,

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.620
when you go to... when child is born they cross them. I mean, You know

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:48.460
so children when they are young, they are taken to church in Russia to be

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:55.260
baptized. We are not baptized. We are born in sahaja yoga. Should we go to church or not?"

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.820
- No. He just asked the question.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:07.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.560
You see, in the church nobody has authority to baptize.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:24.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:32.260
- It is all an artificial exercise.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:38.120
Moreover, this part of your head is very, very sacred.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:45.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.620
It should not be touched by anyone but for a saint.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:03.480
- He should be a real saint
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:12.960
- but these are all artificial.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.300
Only in Sahaja yoga you get the actualization of baptism.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.380
When your Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area,

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.360
then you feel the cool breeze of the Holy ghost coming out of your head.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:41.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:54.220
- These religions are all man-made.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:00.800
For example, Hindus have nothing to do with reality of Hinduism.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:06.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.340
The priest, I mean the priest.The priest of

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:21.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.680
- Same about Islam
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:41.740
- They have nothing to do with Mohammad Sahab.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.440
Same good of Christians; They have nothing to do with Christ.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:01.120
All religions, that we see, have deviated from the Truth.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:08.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.900
They're all money-oriented or power-oriented

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:18.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.600
- [INTERPRETER]
- but they're not Spirit-oriented.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:35.340
All the religions have said that, "You must have your second birth."

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:44.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:51.400
Artificially they all believe that they are special, chosen people of second birth.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:44:00.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.940
But when you get your second birth, you get your powers.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:13.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.740
It is like an egg which becomes a bird - is the second birth.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:22.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:33.660
- The transformation has to take place.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:39.100
These priests have no authority to give you any certificate.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:51.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.480
You have to certify yourself.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.980
- Sickness ones we don't tell.
- Shri Mataji, what do You,

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.900
what do You think about fortune telling on depend?

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:27.720
- Somebody is asking about the fortune-teller.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:38.900
- It's a very limited field.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.560
Most important thing is to know whether you will get your Self-realization or not.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:52.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.780
That is the only thing you should aspire for.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.360
Here is a doctor. She's writing that she's working with a very difficult old

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.080
and young people, sick people and she

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.840
talks to them from the position of sahaja yoga

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:49.900
but she never, she was never familiar with the basic things of sahaja yoga.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:56.960
First time I came to listen here about sahaja yoga

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:04.120
- and I live by your direction,
- Alright
- following Your direction.
- I'll tell you.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:10.640
There's a doctor, who is asking for My direction, to help the sick people.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:17.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:31.780
I would like to tell her, that she should see Dr. Baleena and [ASIDE - Who's the other doctor ...?]

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.820
Here is Dr. [NAME UNCLEAR], Dr. Baleena, Dr. Valentina

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:45.340
- and one who came with us?
- Doctor Mica ... You mean
- [UNCLEAR] other fellow

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:52.960
- doctor Afsa.....okay, okay Dr.[NAME UNCLEAR]

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.480
No, no the one who is a thin fellow, who travelled with us in the car.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:07.020
- Okay, Dr. [NAME UNCLEAR]
- Alright, so you tell them.
- Okay.
- You can meet those people.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:15.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:21.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:30.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.520
Shri Mataji, do you think that all the nations don't have the same quality as the Russians?

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.900
There's a very direct question.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:53.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:57.880
- They do not have.
- Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.140
Also Bulgarians are good.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:04.780
 

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:12.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- Bulgarians, Czechoslovakians,

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:18.240
- Polish.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:25.420
She can receive Your photograph - how to use your photograph?

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:32.240
- I have no photograph of Mine.
- Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.100
but, I think, you can get it from your centers

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:43.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:50.220
- and they will tell you how to use it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.080
but we must have many centers in Moscow

00:49:55.220 --> 00:50:00.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:05.520
and where you can go for the collective development.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:14.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:22.040
- Your growth is only possible in collectivity.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:28.500
- [INTERPRETER]
- It will not work individually.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:41.020
Like, if our nail is cut out, it doesn't grow - it has to be part and parcel in the body.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:48.140
- What is cut out?
- Nail.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:08.220
Shri Mataji, what You would say about that Kundalini is just

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.900
is just a one part of the

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:21.340
All-Pervading Power from which our world is [UNCLEAR] created.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.580
and is energy of the thought.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.000
He's asking Me about Kundalini - I'll tell about this tomorrow.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:48.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.620
Let it be.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:08.940
I am sick and no one can cure me. Will Kundalini cure me?

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:15.560
All about sickness. So most of the sicknesses can be cured through Sahaja yoga.

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.720
Because it is a free thing, people do not take it that seriously.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:33.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:41.120
- What do You think about Kashpirovsky?
- Now, I've already told you about this Kashpirovsky business.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:46.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:54.660
- Last time we had so many children
- [INTERPRETER]

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.620
Last time we had so many children, who came, who were affected by him.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:05.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:10.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:20.360
Shri Mataji, can You tell us why a warm and breeze is coming from my

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.700
- head. This is very warm - not hot but warm.
- Alright.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:31.240
Somebody is getting warm from his head, from the fontanel bone.

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:39.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.780
That means the heat from the body is getting out.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:54.220
So, after, afterwards the cool will start coming - let the heat get out.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.280
Also, if you forgive everyone, the heat will be released.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:13.060
- [INTERPRETER]
- What else?

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:21.900
Shri Mataji, can You charge bread, water

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:27.520
Shri Mataji, please, should we a change our habits,

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.500
- should we change our style of living?
- Haan.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:38.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:50.320
- All these things can be vibrated.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.020
You don't have to change, deliberately, your style

00:54:54.440 --> 00:55:01.080
- [INTERPRETER]
- but automatically it will work out;

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.420
- [INTERPRETER]
- You will change by yourself.

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:34.720
Shri Mataji, what does it mean this sign -

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:41.460
Star of David  - what does it mean Star of David on right hand?

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:49.180
I am practicing yoga since June month and I have problems related to Swadishthan chakra.

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:56.000
Vibrations don't go through Swadishthan; Maybe this is some cursing.

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:03.000
Person has problem with Swadishthan and he doesn't know what does this mean, this sign of the Star of David

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:07.260
Swadhishthan and what to do and he says maybe there's some curse.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:16.440
The symbol of star - he's asking about the symbol of Star of David.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:23.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:28.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:38.560
- It is the Swadhishthan chakra
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:43.660
and is easily cured, if you know, what is the deity on it.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:51.980
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:58.800
- There's very simple way of curing it.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:05.260
You can ask a question, "Mother, are you Moses, are you David?"

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:11.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:19.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- It will work out.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:33.280
This is a good question. If person is practicing sahaja yoga, does it mean that his

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.740
consciousness depends on consciousness of Shri Mataji - of Yours? [UNCLEAR]

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.740
He's asking a question that if he's practicing sahaja yoga, that

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:50.220
his consciousness does it depend on Shri Mataji's consciousness?

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:55.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:04.900
Then you become collectively conscious.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:12.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:18.000
That means you can feel another person on your finger-tips.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:25.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.720
Then the question comes, "Who is the other?"

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:35.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:42.160
- I do not want to tell about Myself
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:45.760
but you must find out after realization.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:51.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:58.000
But, after all, I must be knowing something that I can give realization to all of you.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:07.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:12.440
So, after realization you'll find out who am I.

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:17.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:22.920
See, Christ was the Son of God - that's a fact

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:35.880
- but when He said that, people crucified Him.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.340
It has happened to all the Incarnations, all the sages

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:47.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:53.440
- and I do not want to be crucified.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:58.260
- [INTERPRETER]
- I have to work still

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:05.620
- [INTERPRETER]
- so, I don't want to claim anything.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:19.860
O, My God! Who's made this? You have made it. Alright.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.840
She says this is Ganesha, Mother - this is Ganesha. My,

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.300
- [UNCLEAR]
- Beautiful!

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.380
This child is cured by Me - I mean, by sahaja yoga, I should say.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:48.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.180
Alright, now I'll put them back.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.840
Shri Mataji, who's son was Christ?

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:10.160
- Annh?
- Question is, Dear Shri Mataji, who's Son was Jesus Christ?
- He was, as I already told you,

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.800
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:26.800
In any way when you come to sahaja yoga, you will know about all of them.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:37.180
Shri Mataji, many people are here from City of Talihati. Please, they want to know, "When You will come to our city?"

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.580
- Definitely next year.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.740
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.280
Actually, if I, if I can get a house in Russia, I can stay here permanently.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:08.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:15.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:31.060
- Shri Mataji, very provocative question.
- Huh
- Shri Mataji,

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:38.260
people are saying that 2000 years ago You saw Jesus Christ how He looks.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:46.660
I don't know. Somebody is asking that I saw Jesus Christ 2000 years ago.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:58.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:05.520
- It's not important
- [INTERPRETER]
- and is not easy to describe

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:11.800
- [INTERPRETER]
- but He was a person

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.420
Who was not white, Who was not white skinned person.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:21.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:25.380
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.940
and He was a very healthy, hefty, big person.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:40.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.460
Michelangelo has shown his body very well

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:52.900
- [INTERPRETER]
- in the Sistine chapel
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:57.160
- [INTERPRETER]
- but the face is Italian which was not so.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:02.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.500
A person, Christian is saying, "I am guilty,"

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:21.540
sahaja yoga is saying, "I am not guilty." Don't

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:27.740
- isn't it some contradiction to teaching of Christianity?
- Of course.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:36.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:43.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:50.500
See, it is contradictory to Christianity but not to Christ.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.100
It is contradictory to Christianity but not to Christ.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.000
Christ has never said that you are guilty.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:12.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.140
Moreover, they say that He died for our sins

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:25.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:33.440
- and He suffered for us
- [INTERPRETER]
- and that He was crucified for us.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:40.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.040
So now, only thing you have to awaken Christ within yourself.

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:53.080
- [INTERPRETER]
- He has done all the suffering.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:01.320
- [INTERPRETER]
- What more suffering can we do?

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:09.160
- [INTERPRETER]
- So to feel guilty, is absolutely against Christ.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:16.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.740
That means, we do not believe that He really suffered for us and that He died for our sins.

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:28.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:34.720
- [INTERPRETER]
- All these man-made religions, all of them,

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:42.640
- they say that you are all sinners.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:49.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.700
because they want to make money out of you to frighten you.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:03.320
- You are after all human-beings.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.400
If you do not commit mistakes, who is going to commit mistakes?

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:20.920
- Gods are not going to commit mistake.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.840
- So please, do not feel guilty at all.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:37.180
Shri Mataji, this is true that You are sended to us by God

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:47.040
by God Holy Mary, by God Holy Mary

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:52.520
and you are creating miracles using

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:58.420
God power, power of the Holy Mary - number one and number two question

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:04.020
and is spread here, ideas are spread

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:12.640
with You so, some great power

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:20.940
with You so, how Jesus was suffering on the cross it's true

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:27.080
and tell us what will happen with us in the near future with Russia?

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:33.200
- [UNCLEAR] so question about
- Just again you read out the question then I'll answer.

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:41.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:48.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:53.900
It's true that God sended You and

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:59.420
both of Mary; Mary and You are created miracles - first question.

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:08.800
- I've already told you, I won't tell you anything about Myself.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.480
Some say that I'm the Holy Ghost; Let them say whatever they want to say, let them say

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:22.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.500
It's better you find it out - the Truth.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:32.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:39.880
- Second question was, okay, third question - what will happen with Russia in near future?
- Alright.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:50.560
He's saying that, what will happen to Russia in the near future?

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:56.600
Now, the present is very important.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:04.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:11.920
- It all depends on the present.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.960
If you have patience and that

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.360
you do not complain about material things,

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:34.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:43.100
you will get the greatest blessings of this All-Pervading Power

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:49.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:58.120
and within two years you can become the most powerful, prosperous country.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:09.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:17.320
Only thing, you should now become industrious and not lethargic.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:25.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.360
You must be willing to work out everything.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.420
You must be willing to work out everything.

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:42.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.060
After realization, you'll get lot of energies, lot of ideas.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:55.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:01.140
In, I heard that you had a very bumper crop of wheat in Russia.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:06.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:12.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.380
That is due to sahaja yoga

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:24.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:32.460
- but I'm sorry to hear that 40% was lost.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.660
Now, in our country we do not have machinery to cut the wheat -

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:45.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.460
- we use our hands.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:56.860
If people had taken it upon themselves, they could have easily saved those 40%

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:06.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.520
So, instead of complaining, you have to, you have to join in

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.360
to work out your affluence, your prosperity

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:34.880
I think, we need more, we can say, a dynamic approach.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:48.800
- With sahaja yoga you can do it.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.440
Actually, you should be surprised that you got this freedom so easily.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:03.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:12.120
In My own country, I can tell you about My own parents, who had to sacrifice everything

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:29.720
They had to live - they were living in palaces - they had to live in, in huts.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:38.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:45.440
- We could not have our education,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:51.480
- no food for days together.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:01.860
Even they gave Me electric shocks and also made Me sleep on the ice slabs.

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:09.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:14.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.660
We had no proper shelter, no proper clothes - nothing.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:33.200
- People were living in the jungles.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.780
Every country has suffered a lot for their freedom.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:45.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:52.720
Thanks to Mr. Gorbachev that you have got your freedom so easily.

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:58.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:06.380
- but you have to work it out
- [INTERPRETER]

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:11.300
- and you have to help him.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:25.400
Alright, alright give Me a kiss. They want to give Me a kiss.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.740
Alright, come along.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.580
Children!

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.820
His style was also - see, I think, I told you to try.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:51.140
Done now. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:57.460
Mother, question is about re-incarnation. Shri Mataji, this is true

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.900
that we are living in previous life and then after this we are continuing our life again.

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:12.160
[UNCLEAR] The re-incarnation - this is all nonsense. You come to sahaja yoga, you'll know all about it.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:23.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:31.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:37.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.160
Also, I've seen that, you people are very over-whelmed.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:51.940
Thank you. Thank you. Now give Me a kiss. Thank you.

01:17:53.540 --> 01:18:00.160
[CLAPPING] He made a namaste, Mother.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:07.160
This is... Shri Mataji, it is too late already,

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:11.460
please, will You give us Self-realization. Thank You very much.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.660
That's a very good, very good question.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:22.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:35.920
[APPLAUSE] Thank you very much. [UNCLEAR]

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.600
Now, let it be. You see, the questions even if I answer,

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.500
doesn't mean that your realization is guaranteed.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:57.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:01.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:08.400
I just want you to ask Me questions so that you should feel free

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:15.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:19.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:22.780
but it has nothing to do with Kundalini awakening.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.620
Thank you. Now

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.340
It has nothing to do with Kundalini awakening.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:39.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.960
So, the best thing is, you should just ask for Self-realization.

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.340
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:17.240
I will go through your questions, later on, when I go home

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:24.480
and if I find them sensible, tomorrow I will answer them in any case.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:31.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:37.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:43.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:53.560
[CLAPPING]  Seven chakras - Mother, do You know more than seven chakras, please tell us about this.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.640
What - too many, there are too many chakras.

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:04.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.980
So now, we have to take out our shoes

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:21.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.980
because this Mother Earth helps us

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:31.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:36.900
and your feet also are little bit free.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:51.980
There's one thing that you cannot force Self-realization on anyone.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:02.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:08.760
- You have to ask for it,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:16.000
- you have to desire it
- [INTERPRETER]
- in your own freedom.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:24.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:31.800
So those who do not want to have Self-realization, should please leave the hall.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:38.840
- [UNCLEAR - SAY THEM?]
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:45.500
That will be very kind of them.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.260
- Say that
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:04.160
So, there are three conditions before we start our Self-realization process.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:12.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:20.740
The first one is that you are not to feel guilty at all.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:34.060
As I've told you, that you are human-beings

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.940
and if you have committed any mistakes, it's alright.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:47.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:58.720
This power, which is All-Pervading, is the power of forgiveness

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:06.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:14.400
and you cannot commit any mistake, any mistake that cannot be dissolved by this Power.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:20.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:27.580
So, please, you have to say before starting,

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:34.800
in your heart that, "I am not guilty at all."

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:40.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:45.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.160
If you feel guilty, your this left Vishuddhi catches.

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:54.020
- [INTERPRETER]
- This side
- [INTERPRETER]

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.700
- [INTERPRETER]
- and you develop so many diseases.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:07.700
- [INTERPRETER]
- One of them is angina.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:16.700
- [INTERPRETER]
- Second one, that you can call it as, spondylitis

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:25.220
- [INTERPRETER]
- All the diseases of lethargic organs also.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:33.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:41.860
- So please, do not feel guilty at this moment.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:49.920
Second condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:55.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:04.040
Forgive everyone in general - not to think individually about anyone.

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:12.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:19.320
- Whether you forgive or don't forgive,
-  [INTERPRETER]
- you do not do anything -

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:26.460
-  [INTERPRETER]
- it is a myth.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:33.340
but if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself not the other person.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:37.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:43.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.240
Now the third condition is, that you must have full self-confidence

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.100
that you all can get Self-realization.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:02.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:11.580
- So do not have any doubts about yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:18.180
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.900
Now, you have to, those who are sitting on the chairs, have to put their feet

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:29.140
apart from each other because these are two separate powers.

01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:36.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.380
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.980
and those who are sitting on the ground are alright.

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:51.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:59.860
You have to put your left hand towards Me, sitting very comfortably on your seats.

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:05.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:09.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:20.500
Right hand is to be used for nourishing your centers on the left side.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:28.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:38.360
Now first we'll show you how to do it and then we'll close our eyes.

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:45.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:52.920
Somebody should come.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:01.960
So please, put your left hand towards Me, like this,  the left hand on your lap.

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:09.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:17.020
Now first you have to put your right hand on your heart, where resides the Spirit.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:24.340
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:31.160
- [INTERPRETER]
- but the seat of the Spirit is on the fontanel bone area.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:37.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.800
- [INTERPRETER]
- [HINDI - Thoda paani dijiye] [ASIDE - Give Me some water]. Now,

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:50.140
second centers we have to touch again on the left-hand side

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:53.660
is in the upper part of the abdomen.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:00.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:08.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- [HINDI - Doctor, inse kehna ki coat utaar lein] Doctor, you can take out the coat and turn round the show everyone. [UNCLEAR]

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:16.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.440
Now, the third center -

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:32.260
the second center, is the center of your mastery

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:38.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:45.040
the third center is on the lo...

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.960
lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:55.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:02.280
- This is the center of Pure Knowledge;
- [INTERPRETER]

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.300
Pure Knowledge that acts on your Central Nervous System,

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:14.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:22.780
which knows all the laws of the All-Pervading Power.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:29.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:36.000
Now, you take back your right hand on to the

01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:44.380
upper portion of your abdomen on the, on the guru chakra, which is of your mastery.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:50.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:55.340
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:05.780
Now, please take your right hand now on to your heart again.

01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:11.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:20.440
Now, you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:26.980
[INTERPRETER]

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.200
This is the center you catch when you are guilty.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:38.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:43.340
- Now, turn your head to your right.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.900
Now, you have to take your hand to your forehead, across

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:59.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.380
and put down your head and press it on both the sides.

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:10.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.700
This is the center to forgive everyone, in general.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:22.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:31.720
Now, you have to take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible.

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:36.800
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.600
This is the center where, without feeling guilty,

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:54.860
without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power of love.

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:59.980
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:05.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:09.120
Now, you have to stretch your palm

01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:17.640
and put it on the fontanel bone area on your head,

01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.380
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:28.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:31.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:38.560
- Now, push back your fingers and press it hard
- [INTERPRETER]

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:44.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.680
and now move your scalp slowly,

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:58.440
seven times, with a pressure; Push back your fingers, put down your head.

01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:06.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:12.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:18.880
- Move it clockwise.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:39.120
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:46.940
I saw, some of you did not push back your fingers and did not put a pressure.

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:54.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:35:55.500 --> 01:36:03.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:10.040
Alright, so now, we have to close our eyes.

01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:14.120
You can take out your spectacles.

01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:23.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.160
Till I tell you, please don't open your eyes.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:38.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.960
Remember, the Truth is that, you are not this body,

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:52.080
you are not this intellect, you are not the emotions

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:55.500
but you are the Spirit.

01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:04.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:09.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:18.000
So now, we put our left hand towards Myself

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:24.260
and sit comfortably, not slouching or

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.980
not bent too much but in a normal way.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:41.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:51.160
So now, put your left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart and please close your eyes.

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:58.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:05.580
Now, here you have to ask a very fundamental question to Me -

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.480
you may call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like -

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.620
So now, please ask Me, three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:28.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:32.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.140
- Three times.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:52.280
If you are the Spirit, you are your guide, you are your master,

01:38:53.340 --> 01:39:00.140
so, you have to take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:05.120
and press it hard on the left hand side.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:13.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:19.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:30.260
Here, now, you have to ask Me another, very fundamental question, with full self-

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:36.680
confidence, "Mother, am I my own master?" three times.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:47.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:59.660
I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:07.960
give you Pure Knowledge without your asking for it in your freedom.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:19.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:27.560
So, now, please take your right hand in the lower portion

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:33.040
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:41.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:48.620
Here, you have to ask six times

01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:51.940
because this center has got six petals,

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:58.620
"Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge."

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:05.700
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:10.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:30.020
As soon as you ask for Self-realization, the Kundalini starts

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:34.360
getting awakened and starts moving upward.

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:42.300
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:08.680
As soon as you ask for Pure Knowledge, the Kundalini is getting awakened

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:13.080
so, with full confidence,

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.680
we can nourish our centers, higher centers.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:24.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:37.760
So, we now put our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left hand side

01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:43.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:51.340
and here we say that, with self-confidence,

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:59.220
"Mother, I am my own master," say it ten times with full self-confidence.

01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:04.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:10.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:22.260
I've already told you that you are not this body,

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:30.420
not this mind, not this intellect or these emotions but that you are the Pure Spirit.

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:37.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:55.480
So now, you have to say, with full confidence, twelve times,

01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:00.140
that, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:09.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:23.240
I have already talked to you about this All-Pervading Power.

01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:28.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:34.300
It is the ocean of knowledge,

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:42.780
- [INTERPRETER]
- it is the ocean of compassion and blessings

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:48.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:53.240
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:57.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.420
So, you cannot do anything that cannot be dissolved,

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.660
any mistake that cannot be dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:15.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:21.180
So now, please raise your hand in the corner of your neck

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:25.380
and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:34.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:46.300
Here now, you have to say again, sixteen times, with full confidence,

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:52.500
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:01.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:24.860
I have already told you, that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything

01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:31.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:37.520
but whether you forgive or don't forgive, it makes no difference.

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.640
So, please do not torture yourself

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:57.920
- by playing into wrong hands.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:05.300
Raise your right hand now on to your forehead and put down your head on it.

01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:13.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.460
- Please put down your head.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:27.780
Now here you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:34.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:40.280
Say it from your heart, not how many times - that question doesn't arise -

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.880
Say it from your heart, "Mother,  I forgive everyone."

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:52.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:59.780
I tell you, if you do not forgive, I'm sorry, the realization won't work out.

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:07.300
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.140
Now, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:31.180
you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:49.080
So, please take your hand the back side of your head

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.000
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.300
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:08.860
Here now you have to say, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:17.300
just for your satisfaction, "O Divine Power, if we have done any mistakes, please forgive us."

01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:26.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:32.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:44.940
Say it in your heart, not how many times but say it from your heart.

01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:50.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:58.080
So now, the last center, which is very important.

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:03.100
Now, stretch your palm fully

01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:10.820
and put it on top of the fontanel bone area - exactly, the center of your palm.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:16.480
