00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:06.292
This morning I was telling you
that

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:11.320
If we say that your mind is

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.176
towards us, take it inside you,
you cannot.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.373
I wanted to ask one
more thing.

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:29.398
speak in Hindi or English. Everyone
understands English or Hindi.

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:34.105
‘Bete’ we speak in all. What to

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:39.698
do, in this life learned English as well;
Speak in Hindi,

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:45.806
ok let's speak in Hindi.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.920
For that some incident must happen inside,
there must be something happening; I told

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:55.431
you everything here, [Gusti- Not clear]

00:00:55.456 --> 00:01:00.780
and one more thing It is important that if
the attainment of Soul and God is only to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.640
one or two people, selected people and
if the general public remain unaccessible,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.623
then it carries no meaning
and neither God will mean

00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:17.698
any sense,

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:22.640
nor will this world make any
sense. This creation too is also not

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.706
going to be meaningful. This achievement

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:30.698
should be for common people, if
general public do not get it but of very

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:36.156
selected people, then the same situation
will happen that happened to everyone.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.305
those who lived like this were
never recognized by anyone and

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.564
what happens even by
recognising, Just tell me;

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:45.940
Take it there is someone wrong and is a
King, then he is a king in his own house,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.900
what to us? We haven't got anything,
we should also get something, then

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.239
it has a meaning.

00:01:59.257 --> 00:02:03.208
So this incident must happen,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:06.296
Not only this, it must
happen in general, should be

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.383
among more people, must
happen among lot of people.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:14.010
I told you about science, its ways,
you something about electricity.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.090
The one who found out, if it is not
used for common people the what is the

00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:27.982
point of that electricity.
The achievement of

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:33.564
Sahaja Yoga today is that
Sahaja has been going on for many years.

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.164
Ever since the creation was created,
it has been created spontaneously.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.380
like in a seed there are
sprouts that remain within seed,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.760
everything remains inside it. All
symptoms remain within it, as many as trees

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.690
emerge from within it; in the same way The
entire map of this universe is microscopic,

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.473
already made and all that Formed,
blooming, moving forward in a ‘Sahaja’ way.

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:07.270
'Sahja' meaning: ‘Sah’ i.e. With
you, and 'j' means born; along with you

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.890
this thing is born.

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:18.526
and the way One or two flowers
appear on the tree at first, but when

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.130
the tree grows, sort of spring sets in, it
gets laden with numerous flowers, bearing

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.450
many fruits. Similarly, this Sahaja
Yoga in our hands today is established

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.006
In a new dimension.

00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:38.305
It is for the common people and not for

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.946
the abnormal. Before this do it first
with your mind; Get rid first of your mind

00:03:42.947 --> 00:03:47.655
as to how we will do it brother;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.500
Are we even worthy of this or
not, this incident cannot happen

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.741
inside us. If you have already come
with such a conversation in mind,keep it

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:06.270
outside along with your shoes. This has
to happen, this event is bound to happen.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.072
whether it happens today, it will
definitely happen tomorrow and we have

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:15.564
to do it. And you do deserve it.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:21.873
Now how far do I wander in
search of a worthy person?

00:04:21.873 --> 00:04:24.023
Meaning, if there
is the best thing

00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:25.441
and you have worked only
on it,

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:33.383
what miracle did you do?

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:41.056
So the first thing is that, never think
that this thing will not be done to us.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.040
If already there is any nervousness in this
matter, throw it out because we will

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.965
work hard and this thing will happen;

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.780
now secondly the thing is
that there is doubt that, Mother,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.950
who is she to do this and that we
had heard that Kundalini awakening

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.890
is a very tough task. That for stand firm
on head, then after thousands of years

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.090
It happens, everyone says this; Don't know
what all things have been written down.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:19.106
But this is not the case with us, It
may be that we are an expert of it, it’s

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.300
Craftsman and know the work, that is
why till date we have never seen that

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.580
Someone at some point said that Mother!
Transcend us, and we didn't. All kinds of

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.113
of problems, big permutations,
combinations, it has;

00:05:32.113 --> 00:05:33.536
It also has its problems

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.595
because man has put himself in very
wrong way; it is not necessary that he is

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.420
a bad man, he may be a good man,
but mistakes are committed in ‘Dharma’.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.880
Bows heads at wrong places, recognise wrong
people and such things happen. Men are

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.940
very decent, poor people; they are
very decent man, there is nothing wrong,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.223
they got in trap, did
something stupid and what!

00:06:00.223 --> 00:06:03.406
And because the powers
of Satan are so much

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.256
active in Kalyuga,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.831
Children hardly escape
from its trap,

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:14.176
children are children, don't they?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.500
We have awakened the Kundalini of
thousands, and can do yours too, there is

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.480
no doubt that. But if we can do;
for you to be angry with us for this

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.160
there is no need. Today morning
I had told that if I am its artisan

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.540
I can do it; if you are its
artisans and if someone says to

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.340
cure this, we can not do it;
doesn’t mean that we are inferior

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.740
Nor they get superior.
If you ask us to run this,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.523
We can't run it. You will teach us
seventeen times, we are not able to.

00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:47.565
So we are useless
in this matter.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.380
But the ones we know, we know
the work, we do it and have done it

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.906
and it can happen to you too.

00:06:56.973 --> 00:07:02.156
Therefore, sit down with such preparation
that It has to happen, it is our right,

00:07:02.173 --> 00:07:06.623
and it event will happen,

00:07:06.657 --> 00:07:11.075
and it is for all common people,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.033
Only be prepared for it.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.500
If at all there is any guilt, do tell us;
If some precautions need there be,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.770
do tell us, or messed up
your abstinence, about that too

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.469
you will have to say about that also;
so people get annoyed in petty things.

00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:31.325
Humans are also strange.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.730
If I tell you, for me, you get me Rupees
three thousand, it matters not to you.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.670
you will bring it and immediately give it;
But I would say, son! this is a bit wrong,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.886
if you leave it then
you will feel very bad.

00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:47.736
Will go, will leave the
pandal immediately.

00:07:47.803 --> 00:07:51.186
So we are Mothers, we
have to tell a little bit too,

00:07:51.186 --> 00:07:54.176
don't feel bad about it,
first thing; other thing is

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.536
That, this involves settling. Today
you people have come, some people came in

00:07:59.586 --> 00:08:04.669
the morning, they have come again;
In Sahaja Yoga there is need to settle. As

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:11.140
there is plant and it has a living process,
it needs to settle down. Firstly as

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.780
The seed germinates, its every thing
is very tender, it needs to cherished.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.780
and handled; then when If the tree
is well established then no matter

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:27.130
how strong the wind blows, whatever
problems may occur. No matter how much

00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:31.115
storm comes, it has no fear.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:38.123
so this should be known that after
getting it, it is necessary to settle down.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:43.039
The third thing is also that many People
became very used to listening to speeches.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.160
A ‘Sahib’ had come, who I think
do Gurus shopping. I asked him,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.626
He is visiting all the gurus, came
to me as well, carrying his bag.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.526
Guru’s shopping is on, let's do something
here too. So here the matter is different.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:03.260
You can't do any shopping here, I get
contended only from lectures; speeches are

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.660
fine, in that also I am making
your Kundalini dance and raising it and

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:13.040
until you transcend I won’t have
satisfaction. And, you also

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.800
stuck in this mess, why not attain
realization? After all that is what

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.633
we have to achieve, we have to know
only that,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.585
but Sahaja Yoga does not

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.930
suit because people want to give
money to Mother, do something this or that

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.990
like this, take leave; All Gurus do this.
Well, you can't pay money to Mother here.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:43.250
You can't win your mother un
till you transcend and get set in it.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:49.693
These are two things; people don’t
want, they think that it is a matter of

00:09:49.743 --> 00:09:54.810
very hard work. At the time of transcending
you need not incur any work hard,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:00.376
not at that time, after attainment,
you have to settle down and need settle,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:07.973
the Time has come. This is the call of time
and in this Call of time

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:11.640
If you do not self

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:18.640
awaken, then later it
will be very difficult, that

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:26.010
I will tell you; the second thing is that
in people do not settle in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.630
after that they get diseases, then
Later they come to me and say Mother,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.413
please cure us.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:41.565
After coming into Sahaja yoga,
doctor’s doors, people have

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:47.456
closed; don’t visit their houses;
It can be fixed by all means. But

00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:54.160
there is one thing that after knowing self,
you need to get into yourself, harmonise

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.773
self; and all your full strength

00:11:00.773 --> 00:11:05.906
should be used.

00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:12.120
Sahaja Yoga is not for such people; Whoever
is mother's courageous son, the same

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.506
will get from Mother.

00:11:15.523 --> 00:11:23.206
This I may tell you
first, you don’t mind it.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.723
Tukaram has said, 'Marathi-
Ariya Gabalayache Kamnohe Hoi'

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:34.714
Some one, who is of ‘Patti’
can enter, get into Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:34.739 --> 00:11:39.870
Now I will tell you a
little about Kundalini that I

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.370
[Marathi conversation -
'Kun sa lekshra la lo to tumhi

00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:49.886
kun sa, kun sa kaal sa kaal

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.420
to farab jaal sarvan'] So now we
are here for five days and in five days

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.153
We will tell you completely about
Kundalini.

00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:01.171
Do bring from tomorrow
some paper and pencil !

00:12:01.196 --> 00:12:09.163
so you can also make notes
of all that I am telling you.

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:10.963
Firstly, so you can
see here in front of you,

00:12:15.623 --> 00:12:21.656
This God has created within us,

00:12:21.681 --> 00:12:26.764
A complete instrument. 137.

00:12:26.781 --> 00:12:29.845
Now the instrument, as
we see the worldly things,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:36.523
It is not like that a dead
instrument, It is live;

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.256
And which is called Surti,

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.390
That’s Kundalini.

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:46.197
After all that we the
human beings are active on the strength of

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:52.650
something or the other. Look
at this fire, it is such an amazing thing,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:13:00.190
how efficient is the movement etc. of the
entire body; Whole creation of the Unvierse

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:08.123
how beautifully it is carved. All these
things, there are certain powers that are

00:13:08.156 --> 00:13:13.923
secret; They are secret because the
gross attention, that we have,

00:13:14.007 --> 00:13:16.173
the inanimate
mind, that we have,

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:22.410
cannot understand it, for that there should
be subtlety. And to acquire this subtlety,

00:13:22.443 --> 00:13:26.076
Sahaja Yoga aims at. To
descend into this stillness is

00:13:26.126 --> 00:13:29.410
the goal of Sahaja Yoga that is self

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:35.870
realization, recognizing the soul. As I
told you today morning that without knowing

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:41.290
‘ Atma’, spirit, your illusion cannot
be broken and you cannot know God.

00:13:41.315 --> 00:13:47.123
Whatever you know about that
is Just knowledge, not realization;

00:13:47.156 --> 00:13:50.214
Realization happens only
after knowing the‘Atma’,

00:13:50.239 --> 00:13:54.130
hence the ‘Atma’ will be known
first, only after that everything

00:13:54.130 --> 00:14:00.673
will be understood. Now this Kundalini,
let me explain this complete instrument.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.523
And then I also tell you
Where the Kundalini is? Said;

00:14:03.523 --> 00:14:10.823
First of all, the [ Directing
some one ‘Raise that, raise a bit

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:17.520
one by one’] This that you see in the
left hand, from the right hand side of head

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.903
the power that passes through our
inside and descends on the left hand side,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:31.720
our existence is due to this power.
This is a subtle power; We can’t

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.039
see it, from our head

00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:41.639
this comes and
passing through our

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:47.206
spine and reaches down.
It is not visible to the eyes,

00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:54.398
but when realization occurs then I
will be able to show you each power.

00:14:54.423 --> 00:15:02.406
The nerve that carries this power We
people call it Ida Nadi or Chandra Nadi.

00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:11.010
When this subtle power manifests
itself externally, When it gets expressed,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.560
It’s manifestation
takes place, then our

00:15:14.577 --> 00:15:20.693
left sympathetic nervous
system is formed from this,

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.480
it is responsible for our existence,
this is power our existence. And,

00:15:25.513 --> 00:15:30.439
when this power extinguishes, then we die.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:37.536
hence people call this power

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:43.860
Also called ‘Sanghark Shakti’; in Sanskrit
this power is called Mahakali Shakti.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.676
There are no words
for it in English because

00:15:45.701 --> 00:15:47.895
this thing has not been
explored in English; As to what are

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:54.770
it’s under currents? Sympathetic
and the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.206
what are their under currents,
science has not explored yet.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.940
So for this, if I say the power of
Mahakali, So, there is no need to

00:16:02.965 --> 00:16:08.516
make a big fuss. We people are not English.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.803
And the other
power inside us, that

00:16:13.803 --> 00:16:16.935
passing through the left hand

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:24.440
and comes on the right hand side

00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:26.340
It is called the power
of Maha Saraswati

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:33.339
With this power we do body
movements etc., physical

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.090
activities and Intellectual
activities, mental activities.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.223
You people do not differentiate

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.740
between left and right
sympathetic in medicine.

00:16:50.765 --> 00:16:52.940
Are able to apply, but these
are two things; Left is your

00:16:52.957 --> 00:16:59.273
emotional side and right is your
You have a mental and physical side.

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:02.797
There is no difference in medicine,

00:17:02.822 --> 00:17:06.606
because of this reasons people understand
diseases like diabetes doesn't come;

00:17:06.639 --> 00:17:13.890
I will tell you how Imbalances come
and imbalance can be understood only by

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.470
understanding the difference between
these two things. It turns out that one

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.520
pulse moves more, one moves
less, and the other moves less.

00:17:21.537 --> 00:17:24.120
Because of that he gets diseases.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:30.510
And the one that moves more Aggressively,
by reason of its aggression occurs.

00:17:30.543 --> 00:17:35.585
The sense of imbalance comes
when you can see its two ends.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:43.520
So the power on the right
side, the nerve that’s carrying

00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:52.256
it is called Pingala Nadi.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:59.573
People also call
it ‘Surya Nadi’.

00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:02.506
due to this the right sided
sympathetic nervous system

00:18:02.507 --> 00:18:10.189
Gets manifested.

00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:13.556
The one that you are
seeing in the middle

00:18:13.573 --> 00:18:17.489
there is a ‘Nadi’ nerve,

00:18:17.507 --> 00:18:24.639
this nerve is called
Shushmana Nadi.

00:18:24.673 --> 00:18:27.831
This nerve, so far
this exists within us,

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:34.881
Means, it mensifests the entire
sympathetic nervous system.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.148
The same element
has reached the world.

00:18:37.173 --> 00:18:43.040
Now whatever we have
achieved till date in our

00:18:43.073 --> 00:18:47.123
Transformation, in evolution

00:18:47.157 --> 00:18:51.523
from the state of amoeba to the
state of human, all that is there

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:58.650
in our central nervous system. Understand
it that our central nervous system is a

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:04.806
reflector of all this.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:12.556
It is in our conscious mind.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.431
The Ida Nadi of
the left hand side,

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:21.750
invigorates our dormant
conscious, means

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.023
it invigorates sub conscious.

00:19:26.057 --> 00:19:30.606
or makes it work; As you are
hearing something from me

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.840
just now, this you are hearing
from conscious mind; but this talk

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.820
goes into your dormant conscious.
This is the work of the left sided

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:46.320
this nerve; that whatever conversation
it Listened, immediately stored

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.806
In sub conscious.

00:19:50.807 --> 00:19:55.815
and hence People call it
Conditioning, it can be of two types

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.520
May be cultured and can also be
un-cultured. Now people like Fried

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.100
saw only bad values, his eyes – it means
means the way of acquiring knowledge

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:11.180
of these people, it's like it's
a dark place, came, whatever

00:20:11.204 --> 00:20:15.039
one got in hands sat down
with that, this is the truth.

00:20:15.073 --> 00:20:22.380
Object thing that’s called another
way; light Is switched on, you see all.

00:20:22.413 --> 00:20:25.538
This is the way of Sahaja Yoga; and that

00:20:25.563 --> 00:20:29.080
way of getting such
knowledge by listening, science

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.580
Or any such other blind wat to
get it; then with that way when the

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.213
exploration was done, since
Farite Sahib was already blind

00:20:38.233 --> 00:20:40.256
and I think he himself
was also strange

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.080
mentally indifferent person. What
all dirty things people talk about him.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:51.360
He caught hold of this one and
worked on this and he started saying that

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.660
Whatever, in this way, you ask
someone not to do this, don’t do that, do

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.680
not do this, do not do that, this
results in conditioning; due to which

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.500
man does not remain free; but
he didn't think that if a person is

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.900
not forbidden from one thing then his other
nerve will strengthen. The first ‘Nadi’

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:15.340
generates the superego; The first ‘Nadi’,
that’s ‘Ida Nadi’ generates Superego.

00:21:15.373 --> 00:21:19.766
from conditioning

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:25.250
and the other ‘Nadi’,
that’s of ego which is

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:32.120
on the right hand side, that develops
ego; First, you become Government servant.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.404
‘Sahab’, so you don’t talk to
anyone Properly; Some people went to meet

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:42.500
the Minister ‘Sahab’, there one gentleman
was very impatient. The poor villagers

00:21:42.533 --> 00:21:44.925
asked what’s the matter.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.360
He said don’t you know that I am
P.A. [ ‘PIYE’ in hindi means drunk];

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.800
They said that had you told us
in advance that you are drunk

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:55.580
Why we would talk to you; So this Ego
ascends. This has been not understood

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.400
by Frite Sahab that when you
cut the left side, the other side will

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.000
rise. And ego will swell on to the skull
Super ego. Like this Ego and superego are

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.140
there in our heads; now let me explain ego
and super ego a little because you people

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:16.073
are not of any psychologist,
by God's grace. In Psychology

00:22:16.098 --> 00:22:21.100
It has also been accepted. Ego and
superego, Understand that a small child is

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.713
drinking his milk from his
mother, sitting in bliss, in bliss.

00:22:24.713 --> 00:22:26.928
If, now his mother picked
him up and if she wanted to

00:22:26.953 --> 00:22:31.740
take him to the other side, his ego
gets awakened that why did she do it.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.030
So, his mother scolded him
saying, "No son, don't do this."

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:40.230
So his super ego got awakened.
Like this a balloon like thing like ego and

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.723
super ego accumulates
in our head.

00:22:44.756 --> 00:22:49.996
Ego from front to here and the super ego
from behind like this. Now when both of

00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:54.770
them, after coming, settle down here
properly, only then this part of the head

00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:01.090
That’s the part of fontanel bone Becomes
calcified, gets absolutely solidified,

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:05.710
then the palate gets filled, then it
happens. Then you become 'you', you became

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:11.350
'you', you became 'you'; all left behind,
all separated, everyone has their own

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.210
shells like egg have
shells; Similarly, humans

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:21.330
Too form shells. they get so formed so
that within it human may fully recognize

00:23:21.355 --> 00:23:27.681
his freedom, and
utilizes it properly.

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:31.400
After using it they
will understand

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.795
which thing is right and which is bad.
However, on man, it’s not entirely left.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:44.240
Many great saints took Incarnation
in the world and explained you that

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:52.010
this is the religion, don't do this, do
this; Were they all crazy? We people

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.210
Categorized them as different caste and
side-lined them. From Morning to Evening

00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:00.732
just greet them and over. in our
lives It is useless for us to listen them.

00:24:00.757 --> 00:24:08.474
After all, why did he say

00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:12.109
that, why did he say this? Don't do this,

00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:18.922
don't do this; by doing this, this will
happen, by doing that, this will happen,

00:24:18.947 --> 00:24:22.164
because we are
very intelligent, no!

00:24:22.231 --> 00:24:27.397
we will know everything
through science. What is science,

00:24:27.422 --> 00:24:32.911
it’s a very small part, what
can I tell you? I will tell you that too.

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:40.576
All that you know from science how
small part it is; It’s a very small part.

00:24:40.601 --> 00:24:45.797
The five elements that pass through
your Pingala Nadi, which from about

00:24:45.822 --> 00:24:52.381
the Panch Mahabhutas You just know about
them; As there is gravity inside the Earth,

00:24:52.406 --> 00:24:56.072
but why is it there, how is it?

00:24:56.139 --> 00:25:00.572
You ask a question, Why did
we become humans from amoeba,

00:25:00.597 --> 00:25:07.005
what is the reason, if we are making it,
then Man will ask, why are you making this?

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:14.049
After all it shall have some meaning, why
did God create us! Today a biologist had

00:25:14.074 --> 00:25:18.021
come, he said, “I do not believe in God.”
I said, I am surprised at you that

00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:24.231
if the biology person does not believe,
then that’s done; The rest do with the

00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:29.047
inanimate elements. At least those who are
biologist, should think,

00:25:29.072 --> 00:25:35.911
how beautifully God created man, and It was
created in such a short time that even big

00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:39.897
Biologists are astonished that just by love
chance Man couldn’t be made;

00:25:39.922 --> 00:25:47.597
At the most one amoeba would be made,

00:25:47.598 --> 00:25:50.086
Then upon us this

00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:56.671
responsibility God gave to
us. He gave us freedom to freely

00:25:56.671 --> 00:26:03.431
Know that what is good or bad.

00:26:03.498 --> 00:26:06.516
And when in our freedom if God

00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:12.796
Be called by us, He gives you
this bless that you also know him.

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:19.681
In this way this machine was
prepared and It was set, but

00:26:19.681 --> 00:26:23.216
unless you connect it to the mains, till
then what meaning does it carry? Cards are

00:26:23.241 --> 00:26:25.014
made inside this;

00:26:25.014 --> 00:26:29.536
in the same way the card that was
created inside you, that is Kundalini.

00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:34.027
God has already created you, you have not
to do anything; you don't have to do

00:26:34.052 --> 00:26:41.761
any hard work. Like a seedling, there is a
primula In the same way, God has planted

00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:49.586
Primula within you, the same is
Kundalini, which is in the triangular bone.

00:26:49.611 --> 00:26:57.597
Now the gap, you see, in the middle, this
gap is also present in the central nervous

00:26:57.651 --> 00:27:04.122
system of humans. This gap is the ‘Atma’
in his heart, the spirit in his heart;

00:27:04.147 --> 00:27:12.091
the gap thus formed is this gap. The spirit
in side us. Yes, that's the gap. The soul

00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:19.751
within us, it knows; It’s regional,
but in our central nervous system it’s

00:27:19.751 --> 00:27:25.491
not there. Means, it’s not in our conscious
mind, meaning that we have not known it;

00:27:25.516 --> 00:27:32.347
It knows us; So,
this gap that is there,

00:27:32.372 --> 00:27:36.151
it was created because

00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:41.691
Kundalini has to rise from within this;
The same incident that I told you about

00:27:41.691 --> 00:27:48.351
happening, Kundalini awakening is that
incident; But this mechanical thing, which

00:27:48.351 --> 00:27:51.111
you should not consider
dead, is a living phenomenon.

00:27:51.124 --> 00:27:54.386
Such as a primula
emerges from a seed, alike

00:27:54.411 --> 00:28:02.026
it is a living thing. Man has till date
haven't done any living work, have you?

00:28:02.051 --> 00:28:07.651
Pop out a sprout from a
seed; A tree died, you erected

00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:11.971
a pillar, you became a great man; this
you are just changing the dead, weather

00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:18.231
make a chair or make something out of it.
Then he started sitting on the chair, so

00:28:18.231 --> 00:28:21.097
the chair sat on the head and can’t sit
down and have been tight;

00:28:21.122 --> 00:28:24.988
look at behind you people sitting
there, can’t sit on the ground.

00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:29.081
Such situation has
come, it’s slavery started.

00:28:29.106 --> 00:28:31.601
What benefit did you
get from this dead work? You explore

00:28:31.626 --> 00:28:39.567
all the dead elements; You should find
out the living element, how it happens?

00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:48.256
How does a seedling grow into a big, massiv
tree, would you be able to find out this?

00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:52.636
Thousands of such things all around
you see; you say, “Yes, it’s like this.”

00:28:52.661 --> 00:28:56.656
This is how it looks like; But
how does that event occur?

00:28:56.681 --> 00:29:00.781
This is a very subtle
phenomenon, you cannot see it.

00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:07.766
You know that many voices are of
such high frequencies that you can’t hear.

00:29:07.791 --> 00:29:14.526
The condition in which man has been
created, In this condition he cannot know

00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:17.516
this subtle thing. But he has been
so created that he

00:29:17.541 --> 00:29:19.914
can know that too.

00:29:19.998 --> 00:29:26.980
Only a human being
can know; in man itself

00:29:27.051 --> 00:29:32.251
Such a brain is specially designed
which is triangular, in which all these

00:29:32.251 --> 00:29:36.631
happenings occur; inside it are
Ego and Superego meet in this

00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:42.939
way and Kundalini keeps
siting in the human in this way.

00:29:42.964 --> 00:29:50.911
Now you think that
The entire universe

00:29:50.911 --> 00:29:57.846
was created, the earth was specially
created, vegetation was created in it

00:29:57.871 --> 00:30:04.271
Created and then created you and
created specifically for you And all such

00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:08.551
things were kept in it and only you have
the right to Know God and embrace His power

00:30:08.551 --> 00:30:14.011
Carry from within. This is
your goal, Yours fulfilment; Until

00:30:14.011 --> 00:30:21.211
the power of God comes from within
you, You don't make any sense, you don't

00:30:21.211 --> 00:30:28.551
mean anything; so does the whole universe
mean nothing. This is to happen and

00:30:28.551 --> 00:30:36.541
all that happening today is also historical
thing. Coming of all in the world,

00:30:36.566 --> 00:30:41.305
step by step, is important;
I will tell about it tomorrow

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:46.251
how every great incarnation and
those whom we call prophets, that

00:30:46.276 --> 00:30:51.461
we call Guru, how did they come
into this world and what did they do

00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:55.941
in our awareness, in our
consciousness and where do they

00:30:55.941 --> 00:31:03.930
reside within us, I will
tell you all that tomorrow.

00:31:03.964 --> 00:31:07.205
This Kundalini is present here
in the triangular bone or not,

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.361
Even this much people do
not know; and on Kundalini,

00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:15.381
write such huge books, tell me
what should I do ? In such big

00:31:15.381 --> 00:31:19.721
books it is not even known where
Kundalini is; We can make you witness this,

00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:26.636
you can see its vibration with your own
eyes; weather you are transcended or not

00:31:26.661 --> 00:31:28.942
you can see its vibration;

00:31:28.967 --> 00:31:33.952
You can see the rise and fall
with your eyes; Hey! Just like yours,

00:31:33.977 --> 00:31:37.363
just like your breathing is going on,
like that the breathing of the Kundalini

00:31:37.387 --> 00:31:41.101
will be visible. Triangular bone If we look
below, at that time the Kundalini will be

00:31:41.101 --> 00:31:48.246
seen growing like this, you see, see with
your eyes. We also made a film about it.

00:31:48.271 --> 00:31:55.259
When the Kundalini rises, its vibration
commences, but some are so good people

00:31:55.284 --> 00:32:00.051
that spontaneously find it on top, it’s
not visible in them; whose Navel ‘Nabhi’

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:04.551
Chakra will have catch, the ‘Nabhi’ Chakra,
that’s there, when it has a catch there,

00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:10.511
then the Kundalini will be visible; Not
only this much, you will also see that when

00:32:10.511 --> 00:32:15.131
Kundalini rises; Take it that your liver
If there is a problem then you will see

00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:20.997
that there is pulsation on the side of
the liver. You will see it with your eyes.

00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:27.431
If you use your stethoscope, you
can see it where its rising? At the end

00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:35.031
It reaches there, which Kabir said, 'Shunya
Shikhar Pe Anharad Baji Re' Its pulsation

00:32:35.031 --> 00:32:40.731
Is felt; 'Anharad' means pulsation occurs,
then Only when it opens the pulsation

00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:46.211
stops and the power, that’s omnipresent
which you do not know in its subtleness;

00:32:46.211 --> 00:32:52.991
That rears and endures every leaf,
every flower, every fruit and every humans,

00:32:52.991 --> 00:33:00.977
in care of that power, ‘Shakti’

00:33:01.002 --> 00:33:06.451
you become one. So
far you have not known

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:12.851
so you won't be aware of it,
just read and read about it, you

00:33:12.876 --> 00:33:15.772
haven't realized it yet.
Must be aware of it,

00:33:15.797 --> 00:33:22.141
Without realizing it everything
has settled. happened, you already

00:33:22.141 --> 00:33:29.797
started doubting it; Hey brother!
in this what is there to doubt?

00:33:29.821 --> 00:33:33.583
Haven't people written about this before?

00:33:33.608 --> 00:33:37.132
Everyone told; But now the
time has come for everyone to get,

00:33:37.157 --> 00:33:42.132
so everyone has to get it. Needed; But
everyone will accept it, I also know it.

00:33:42.157 --> 00:33:48.451
There are many reasons of it, there
are many reasons of it; Now these centres

00:33:48.451 --> 00:33:55.206
These chakras, these subtle centres Are
made inside us. These centres within us

00:33:55.231 --> 00:34:01.172
reflect the steps of evolution
that has taken place within us.

00:34:01.197 --> 00:34:04.091
These are stages; first when

00:34:04.091 --> 00:34:08.597
We were carbon, so this is the first
Chakra which belongs to Lord Ganesha.

00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:13.686
After that, when
Brahmadeva created the entire

00:34:13.711 --> 00:34:19.951
universe, then second Chakra is there
which is of Brahmadev, this is Swadhishthan

00:34:19.951 --> 00:34:24.991
Chakra, that too is within us, only
due to which we can create the universe;

00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:31.074
Because of that
only we plan, think.

00:34:31.074 --> 00:34:35.332
After that is Nabhi Chakra.

00:34:35.357 --> 00:34:43.261
From Nabhi Chakra, you know
that For being Human from fish

00:34:43.261 --> 00:34:50.671
whatever has happened, has taken
place in this lap only. To help us in this,

00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:55.887
there have been
great Gurus within us,

00:34:55.888 --> 00:34:59.116
Whom you know, from Socrates

00:34:59.141 --> 00:35:04.024
to Confucius, Moses, Raja Janak,

00:35:04.024 --> 00:35:10.612
Mohammad Saheb, Nanak Saheb,
all these whence became great Gurus,

00:35:10.637 --> 00:35:15.489
all these Gurus worked hard on
this and created the religion of man.

00:35:15.514 --> 00:35:23.201
The Human religion is inside the stomach;
His religion is not outside; As this

00:35:23.201 --> 00:35:28.301
Gold has its religion,
it doesn’t go bad, it is

00:35:28.301 --> 00:35:31.376
Untarnishable. In the same
way the ten religions of Human

00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:37.241
remain in his stomach; If a person
becomes oblivious to this religion then his

00:35:37.241 --> 00:35:43.907
Kundalini does not rise, Brother!
these religions need again be fixed.

00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:50.321
The Kundalini, herself need come, fix them
care them; only after that the Kundalini

00:35:50.321 --> 00:35:55.971
Rises, so suction happens,

00:35:56.021 --> 00:36:00.286
and whatever this work,
it’s done by the Kundalini,

00:36:00.311 --> 00:36:05.611
you do not have to do anything. Effortless;
You were born, what efforts did you make,

00:36:05.611 --> 00:36:13.231
or a tree emerged from the
seed? What efforts did seed do?

00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:19.741
which books did it read? Similarly when
this is a live activity what an effort you

00:36:19.766 --> 00:36:25.441
need do, effortless. Sahaj
means ‘Effortless’ and has

00:36:25.466 --> 00:36:31.104
come from ‘Sahaja’ word,
it means Born with you.

00:36:31.129 --> 00:36:37.126
This Right to Yoga is
born with you because

00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:42.011
you are human; It’s your birth
right that you attain this Yoga;

00:36:42.011 --> 00:36:45.811
through this you know God, it is yours
right. But you yourself do not want to

00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:53.414
use your rights, What God may do?
Now there are these subtle Centres;

00:36:53.439 --> 00:37:00.751
If you attain these Centres and If you
can awaken them then your health will

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:08.751
even otherwise be fine. There is a
disease, take it, what is called multiple

00:37:08.751 --> 00:37:13.391
Sclerosis; those doctors, they say it
can’t be cured, we say that in Sahaja Yoga

00:37:13.391 --> 00:37:19.124
it will be cured. It will be
hundred percent absolutely cured.

00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:21.249
In this we see three Chakras, That are bad:

00:37:21.274 --> 00:37:27.951
Muladhara Chakra, Navel ‘Nabhi’ Chakra
and Agnya Chakra. If these three Chakras

00:37:27.951 --> 00:37:33.211
If we set right, it will be cured.
When you explore a thing

00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:39.051
from outside; Take it that there is a
tree, it got a problem. Now from outside,

00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:42.831
even if you have done something right in
it, then some betterment may occur; But if

00:37:42.831 --> 00:37:50.651
You know to fix something from its root
then the tree will be fine. Just like this

00:37:50.651 --> 00:37:56.071
cancer disease; Cancer
disease also results due to your

00:37:56.071 --> 00:38:02.471
this sympathetic nervous system, due to its
excessive usage, either emotionally or you

00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:06.931
use it to the extreme for other reasons.
Sometimes irritation occurs, sometimes

00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:11.491
infection occurs; for any reason the
sympathetic emergency that remains on you.

00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:16.631
If always there an emergency remains in
your life like the potato of emergency, the

00:38:16.631 --> 00:38:24.201
same thing happens to the human being. At
that time your para sympathetic which is

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:27.426
there, keeps fixing your cancer all the
time; your get cancer every day. Means,

00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:31.701
you use it daily and it is para sympathetic
that keeps fixing, balancing itself,

00:38:31.701 --> 00:38:37.671
which is the Sushumna Nadi in the middle,
but as this is left side and right side.

00:38:37.671 --> 00:38:42.031
Now the left side’s sympathetic and the
right sided sympathetic, both these are

00:38:42.031 --> 00:38:46.871
fully working like this; When
these break, the gods inside them

00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:50.931
also fall asleep. Then malignancy occurs.
A cell that is there starts growing a lot,

00:38:50.931 --> 00:38:57.522
It infected the other one
and that too started growing

00:38:57.547 --> 00:39:00.282
It gets related by the
contact, not to the whole.

00:39:00.307 --> 00:39:07.771
Out of the whole body, one single started
Growing arbitrarily. Cancer has occurred,

00:39:07.771 --> 00:39:14.021
If we awaken this Deity, the cancer gets
cured; Now whether there are Gods or not,

00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:17.637
People will say why believe in gods,
whether there are gods or not? Now after

00:39:17.671 --> 00:39:20.620
Sahaja Yoga you will see for yourself that
things get better when you take their

00:39:20.654 --> 00:39:24.787
names. So there are Gods will be seen
only after Sahaja Yoga. But we can explain

00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:32.669
 it mentally also. As adrenaline and
acetylcholine are two chemicals;

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:35.116
Take it that both
these are absolutely

00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:40.541
dead chemicals, but they behave
strangely in our body, no one understands;

00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:46.949
They say we cannot explain their mode
of action. Means, they are honest people,

00:39:46.974 --> 00:39:51.701
all scientists aren’t liar, but they have
their own decorum, they have their own

00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:55.261
limitations, telling according to that
that we can not tell that at some place

00:39:55.261 --> 00:39:59.001
it augments and at other places it
relaxes. Its not understood that the same

00:39:59.026 --> 00:40:05.478
things these
Deities do inside us;

00:40:05.525 --> 00:40:08.361
If any foreign matter
enters our body, then body

00:40:08.361 --> 00:40:12.778
efforts to expel it out of it. But if the
foetus in the stomach which is child,

00:40:12.779 --> 00:40:14.428
being a mass,

00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:18.644
if settles it’s not thrown away, it is
cared. Its nurtured, It is looked after.

00:40:18.669 --> 00:40:22.378
And when the time comes,
is thrown out on time.

00:40:22.403 --> 00:40:26.016
The work of Lord Ganesha,
that is performed by Lord

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.233
Ganesha. The element of
Ganesha does this work within us.

00:40:30.258 --> 00:40:33.193
Now doctors will not
believe in Ganesh ji, they will

00:40:33.217 --> 00:40:37.997
keep photos in their house, Nanak ji's
photo will remain. Ganesh ji's will remain,

00:40:38.031 --> 00:40:41.901
all will remain; but Ganesha
resides in our Mooladhara Chakra

00:40:41.901 --> 00:40:49.269
Not understandable, what should I do? Tell
me how to teach them? Now the girl with

00:40:49.294 --> 00:40:53.001
sclerosis who came here on the stage in the
morning, I just told her to chant Ganesh

00:40:53.001 --> 00:40:56.636
Mantra right in front of us., she became
alright, but you will say, ‘It can’t be’.

00:40:56.724 --> 00:41:04.056
But if you say so, it
is not going to happen.

00:41:04.081 --> 00:41:09.321
Because you should have authority to awaken
Shri Ganesha; But if you get transcended

00:41:09.321 --> 00:41:15.541
then you too will get the right. When
you are a citizen of Delhi, whatever are

00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:18.639
rights of Delhi then
you are fully entitled to. If

00:41:18.663 --> 00:41:21.761
you become the citizen of
God’s kingdom, then what

00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:26.281
Ganesh ji and what Hanuman ji? All
stand in front of you with folded hands

00:41:26.281 --> 00:41:32.361
tell us what is your work to be
done? Say. Now this thing is true or not

00:41:32.361 --> 00:41:36.936
You should investigate and see.

00:41:36.959 --> 00:41:43.031
First come into the
kingdom of God, this is the first thing,

00:41:43.056 --> 00:41:46.121
otherwise you are not its citizens;
You are of the Government of India.

00:41:46.121 --> 00:41:52.531
Stay in their efficiency;
We are saying

00:41:52.531 --> 00:41:58.522
that you come under the Government of God
and then we will tell you; Then see where

00:41:58.547 --> 00:42:02.931
your powers reach to, then leave
aside cancer, no disease will touch you.

00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:09.022
You will cure others' cancer,

00:42:09.047 --> 00:42:12.466
But without realization, we
cannot talk about anything.

00:42:12.491 --> 00:42:20.489
The point is to first get transcended,
only then you descend into the subtle.

00:42:20.514 --> 00:42:24.896
When you go descend into the Subtle, you
will control it yourself. You can control

00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:31.221
that thing yourself which is controlling
the entire creation because this is

00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:37.201
omnipresent power, ‘Shakti’;
as soon as you are in it

00:42:37.201 --> 00:42:39.829
it starts flowing through the
central nervous system, your heart,

00:42:39.853 --> 00:42:42.481
it’s vibrations start flowing
through your central nervous system,

00:42:42.481 --> 00:42:46.281
You get vibrations in
your hand, the cool breeze

00:42:46.306 --> 00:42:51.311
That’s called
‘Chaitanya Lahariyan.’

00:42:51.336 --> 00:42:56.694
When this starts flowing
from inside you, mean the spirit

00:42:56.719 --> 00:43:01.731
flows from within you Then it seems
that whatever you do, you are doing it in

00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:08.531
the kingdom of God. It is important for a
human being to have this. Then I don't even

00:43:08.531 --> 00:43:11.931
have to say that you quit alcohol
or quit smoking, nothing; must have

00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:15.751
to leave, we do leave, because when
inside If you start enjoying, then who will

00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:20.371
enjoy outside? Now whoever, sitting
here were drunkards, all the people sitting

00:43:20.371 --> 00:43:22.651
there at the back were hard drunkards;

00:43:22.684 --> 00:43:25.059
what drunkard, who may send you
guys to hide-outs, of this kind. Like this

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.926
these used to take drugs;

00:43:26.951 --> 00:43:31.771
abandoning everything today they
are having fun, it happens automatically.

00:43:31.771 --> 00:43:39.500
In that there's no need to say anything
else when start to get inner happiness.

00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:42.971
all external things automatically fall
away; I don't even have to say anything

00:43:42.971 --> 00:43:50.161
special! like a small thing: animal If
you want, you can take it from the dirt,

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:54.536
take it from the dung, an
animal doesn’t feel foul odour.

00:43:54.561 --> 00:44:00.181
But if you take a human, he does feel
it, right? In the same way when you enter

00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:04.841
the Kingdom of God, your conscious becomes
so that you can’t tolerate It. You will

00:44:04.841 --> 00:44:12.274
feel burning sensation like in your
hand you can't bear it; By itself the thing

00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:16.038
is abandoned. So, whatever the problems are
there Everything gets swept away.

00:44:16.063 --> 00:44:21.325
everything automatically
falls away from you.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:27.391
I won't have to say anything in that,
everything will happen automatically.

00:44:27.416 --> 00:44:35.224
Today I have given you an introduction
about Sahaja Yoga. That is, I will tell you

00:44:35.249 --> 00:44:42.151
all the deep things, I have said
that the more subtle, the subtlest of it.

00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:47.581
I have knowledge, I will tell you all
that; I am ready, this is all knowledge,

00:44:47.606 --> 00:44:53.808
 everything else is ignorance. Things will
work out at your fingertips.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:57.007
You first of all know yourself!

00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:04.597
You are not recognizing your power and are
Sitting confused. So far your motor has not

00:45:04.631 --> 00:45:08.811
started yet, start the motor
at least, then you will know. Prior to that

00:45:08.825 --> 00:45:12.903
you are doing other work.

00:45:12.904 --> 00:45:14.845
one this, It's a small thing

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:25.098
[HEY, MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND - HOW
SON, ARE YOU OKAY, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT]

00:45:25.992 --> 00:45:28.625
so the first thing is this,
and happening of this event,

00:45:28.649 --> 00:45:34.061
the another thing is to settle
down and; the third thing is to know

00:45:34.061 --> 00:45:37.637
the full knowledge, which chakra is where,
in which way the Chakra is made to act,

00:45:37.662 --> 00:45:44.141
how to fix it; There are only three steps
of this Sahaja Yoga, once you do this

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:48.042
then you become a great
Sahaja Yogi and right sitting

00:45:48.066 --> 00:45:51.892
do your own miracles and
of others too; and enjoy!

00:45:51.917 --> 00:45:58.692
because your Power, ’Shakti’, will
keep on flowing from within all the time.

00:45:58.717 --> 00:46:02.946
Do you understand? Do
everyone understand or not?

00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:07.606
Is there still a
question in the skull?

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:11.646
If there is no question, then now
After this we will all go into meditation.

00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:15.921
I'll be back in a minute or two, you guys.
Just loosen your waist a bit, take off

00:46:15.971 --> 00:46:20.951
your tie etc., because ‘Vishuddhi’ ‘Chakra’
is getting caught. And sit lightly.

00:46:20.951 --> 00:46:26.831
Very light, we are not Guru or something.
We are your mother. You are everything

00:46:26.831 --> 00:46:32.831
to us and we are yours Mother! loosen
up a bit your body, yes socks if you want,

00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:37.463
so do it; there is no harm,
some nylons etc. thing

00:46:37.533 --> 00:46:40.067
it may have, isn’t it? Do as you like.
