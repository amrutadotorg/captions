1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,260
This was a song composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,220
so many years back, when he had a vision

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,580
of our Ganapatipule seminars.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,420
where he describes that people from all the world will come,

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,900
from different countries will come.

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:37,440
Also, the Hindus, the Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and all kinds of communities

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,780
will get their awakening on the bank of the sea.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,700
‘Sagar’, sagar is the sea.

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,580
So beautifully every detail he has described.

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,100
He was a seer and he could see the future

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,760
where many people, who are seekers, to become ‘mahamanav’ they come.

12
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,720
And it’s very surprising how these seers

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,660
have seen the future.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,480
Like, as you know, C. S. Lewis is there

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,800
and also, we have got William Blake, so many others.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,220
And I feel today, in Bengal, when I have come here in Calcutta,

17
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,120
that his dreams are fulfilled.

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,860
His Spirit would be so happy to know-

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,660
So, as you know that we get all kinds of people, all races,

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
all religions together in Ganapatipule

21
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:46,235
and where you all enjoy the bliss of

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,400
God, where you feel that there’s an awakening.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,235
Also, He says that

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,020
the great Mother has now risen, and She is awakened

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,195
and She is going to awaken you.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,340
So, clearly, he has seen the whole thing.

27
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,700
It’s remarkable how these seers can see things and reveal,

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,880
to our amazement.

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,280
I am very happy that we have such nice company

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,040
of Baba Zaheer and his other brothers,

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,480
who are qawwals and his sons also, who are qawwals.

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,760
So, this is such a great thing to understand

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,560
that these people have felt the same awakening within them as you have,

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,460
and that

35
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:41,965
they have really become Sahaja Yogis now

36
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:43,760
and they sing from their heart.

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,215
Some of these poems, I think, they made later on, after going from Bombay.

38
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:51,255
Because I see that they are all new songs.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,360
And, they are singing what you would like to say.

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,500
they are singing what you would like to express.

41
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:03,195
And that’s why you feel so joyous and happy

42
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:06,545
that, "you are saying what we wanted to say all these days".

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,920
It’s remarkable how in the collectivity the thought

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Tongue works in a very different manner

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,215
that we all want to say the same thing.

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,320
For everyone, that is the truth.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,800
And you all feel so joyous about it

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
and so happy about it.

50
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:36,260
It is something, a kind of a rapport between one Realized soul and another Realized soul.

51
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,120
Only a Realized soul can understand the bliss

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,180
and the joy of this expression.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,160
Of course, so many things have been said about Me,

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,280
that’s quite embarrassing. I don’t know what I do.

55
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,300
I, really, I don’t think I do anything. It's all working out.

56
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
It's all grace of the, this All-pervading Power

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,300
which is working out everything so well.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,860
Today is the concluding day for us

59
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,240
and to have such a nice program of qawwali here was really remarkable.

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,800
I am sorry that half of the people have left

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,200
because they didn’t know there was a program.

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,780
Today we had to make some arrangements, in that it was lost.

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,520
Doesn't matter.

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Those who are lucky have listened to them and have enjoyed them thoroughly.

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
I bless those qawwals from my heart,

66
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,180
and I always think there will be more people

67
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,640
who will appreciate their music and understand

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,200
and so many Muslims-

69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,720
as yesterday, Ilal said, "Mother, when will the Muslims know about You?"

70
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,720
So, these are the people who can spread the news all over

71
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,200
and can tell that now the time has come of ‘Qiyama’

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
where you will have to get your Self-realization.

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
They're very important, I'm so concerned about the Muslims now

74
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,760
Because they are in quite darkness, and the way they are killing people

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,085
because they are Muslims and they are killed in so many places

76
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,940
while they also kill.

77
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,980
It's a very violent, nonsensical thing,

78
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,280
which was never preached by Mohammed Sahib.

79
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,220
He was the one who was for love and love and love.

80
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,580
He is the one who had to fight because they were so aggressive on Him.

81
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,080
But otherwise,

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,660
if you read Koran, you'll be surprised

83
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,460
how much He has praised the love of God.

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,200
And that’s what is so misleading these days

85
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,920
that we don’t understand.

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,840
I am happy at least the Sahaja Yogis understand Koran and understand Mohammed Sahib

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,680
and are in devotion to Mohammed Sahib as they are to any other Guru.

88
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
It’s very creditable for you people to accept.

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,660
Because you have seen on your vibrations that Mohammed Sahib was an Incarnation

90
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,680
of a Master

91
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,760
so you cannot deny it.

92
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,895
And these conditionings have gone into complete negligence now,

93
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:19,735
and most of the Sahaja Yogis have such a respect

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,260
for Mohammed Sahib and for Koran.

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,580
I wish all the luck to these people

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,075
that they propagate this idea

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,380
and try to bring peace on this earth

98
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,460
by telling people that what Mohammed Sahib has said and what are we doing.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
In the same way, for all of us,

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,240
to whatever religion we may belong,

101
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,645
we have so many conditionings and wrong ideas.

102
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,705
So, we should try to correct them

103
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,660
and see for ourselves that

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,260
all of them came to spread spirituality.

105
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,060
As I always said, they were like flowers on a tree

106
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,820
same tree of spirituality they came.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,780
And whatever they had to do at that time, ‘samayachar’, they did it.

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,755
But we have plucked the flowers

109
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,105
and now fighting with the dead flowers.

110
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:14,575
So, as Sahaja Yogis, when you are awakened in knowledge,

111
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,940
and you know what knowledge is,

112
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,040
then you have to really understand that we are all on the same path of spirituality.

113
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,360
There’s no difference at all.

114
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,540
May God bless you all for enjoying this qawwali

115
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,820
and for coming all the way to Calcutta.

116
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,060
It has been really a tremendous task, I must say.

117
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,660
All my thanks are to these great organizers

118
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,020
who have organized such a big thing in this place.

119
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,040
And we had, yesterday, the whole thing filled up, you see.

120
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,080
And the way it was conducted and worked out was so remarkable.

121
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,380
All the leaders who came here

122
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,640
were amazed at their organizing capacity.

123
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:14,095
And they told Me, “Mother, we have to learn a lot from them.

124
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,700
We can, of course, not surpass them.

125
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,160
But whatever they have done is such an eye-opener

126
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,240
that we have to now dedicate ourselves fully

127
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,840
to proper understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

128
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,980
its spreading and all the organizing should be our first priority.

129
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,755
Unless and until people take interest in that,

130
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:40,985
we cannot achieve what these people have achieved.”

131
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,875
The collectivity of the

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,980
Bengali people and Marwaris and all types of people

133
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,920
who are here,

134
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,780
from every part of our country, is so remarkable.

135
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,600
There’s no quarrelling, no discussion, no argument,

136
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,820
it's done so beautifully.

137
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,020
Unbelievable how they have worked it out!

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,795
So, we have to remember that we are one

139
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,455
part and parcel of one being.

140
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,800
And once we really realize that,

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,900
we’ll enjoy each other’s company very much.

142
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,000
All Sahaja Yogis enjoy each other's company.

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,680
And also, all of you from the whole world, who have come here

144
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,780
have seen how marvelously they have organized everything.

145
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,900
I am thankful to you for coming here to celebrate My birthday

146
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,960
And

147
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,340
I don't know what to say now,

148
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,440
because every birthday you discover such nice things and such nice people.

149
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,780
This birthday was really remarkable for its all organization

150
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,800
and the way it was worked out so smoothly.

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,540
I wish we all learn from this.

152
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,420
We are all thankful to the organization of Calcutta,

153
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,120
for organizing this so well. Give them a hand.

154
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,160
I know it's so overwhelming that we cannot even stop clapping.

155
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,080
Also, we have to again and again thank these qawwals,

156
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
And now the way they feel confident about life,

157
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:48,145
as you people all feel confident.

158
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,500
In the kingdom of God, there's nothing to worry [cut] last, but to enjoy the present.

159
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,660
And that's what they are doing and you were doing too.

160
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,140
I enjoyed, I enjoyed the rapport that existed between you.

161
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,380
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
