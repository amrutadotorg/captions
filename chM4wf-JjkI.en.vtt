WEBVTT

00:15.560 --> 00:20.360
It’s my privilege and pleasure to introduce

00:20.560 --> 00:25.880
the first of our distinguished guest-speakers.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.720
He bears a famous name

00:30.480 --> 00:33.480
and needs very little in the way of introduction.

00:34.600 --> 00:40.600
Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and industrialist

00:40.600 --> 00:44.600
of course, he was the man who invented dynamites

00:44.840 --> 00:51.880
and left his fortune to be used for the Nobel Prize

00:52.680 --> 00:54.800
himself was a bachelor,

00:55.040 --> 01:00.840
but Mr. Claes Nobel is his grandnephew.

01:01.920 --> 01:09.320
He was inspired by the work of his distinguished forebear

01:10.200 --> 01:18.200
and has himself had the inspiration to found an organization

01:18.840 --> 01:22.760
which is called “United Earth”, which he is still the chairman.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.880
And this organization has itself instituted a prize

01:26.920 --> 01:30.080
in the ecological sphere

01:30.160 --> 01:35.920
which is not one of the Nobel Prizes, there is no prize for ecology.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.720
And this prize he calls “Earth Ethics”.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.240
He met Shri Mataji last year in India

01:43.280 --> 01:48.600
when he was the chairman of the World Philosophers conference.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.280
So without any more ado, I’dd like to

01:51.320 --> 01:55.000
invite Mr. Claes Nobel to come on to the stage, please.

02:07.040 --> 02:13.120
Well, indeed, life is full of surprises,

02:13.520 --> 02:19.840
after all we are meeting here inspired by the message and work

02:20.240 --> 02:25.080
by Holy Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

02:25.480 --> 02:33.200
and She is not here in body, but She is here in Spirits.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.440
Also the wonderful letter that we recently heard

02:36.480 --> 02:39.280
from ayatollah Ruhani

02:39.400 --> 02:43.280
which speaks very highly about the work and the mission

02:43.320 --> 02:45.680
of the Holy Mother,

02:45.800 --> 02:50.560
where he indicates the importance of women

02:50.600 --> 02:54.400
in the world is needed here.

02:54.760 --> 02:59.400
And frankly speaking, only 36 hours ago

02:59.440 --> 03:02.000
I did not know that I would be here

03:02.120 --> 03:05.360
tonight at the Royal Albert Hall,

03:05.440 --> 03:08.920
addressing this audience.

03:09.080 --> 03:17.080
Still I say: Dear Holy Mother,

03:17.720 --> 03:25.120
and I also recognize her husband Sir C.P. Srivastava in the audience,

03:25.320 --> 03:31.840
and I say, most importantly: dear friends, fellow-seekers of truth,

03:32.040 --> 03:35.200
Are you out there? Because with all this light,

03:35.360 --> 03:39.120
I can only see about 20 people in front of me.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.320
So, say “yes”, if you are in here, then I know…

03:43.640 --> 03:44.720
Ah…

03:51.560 --> 03:56.840
Now I can see you, I can here you as well as you can see and here me.

03:56.920 --> 04:02.200
With that said, I want to say I have a vision,

04:02.440 --> 04:08.080
I have a vision for a world that is better, safer and saner

04:08.200 --> 04:11.600
than the one that we presently are experiencing.

04:11.800 --> 04:17.360
It is a world where people live in harmony and peace with themselves

04:17.480 --> 04:21.000
and in harmony and peace with Nature.

04:21.160 --> 04:26.480
Now, those words of vast, it’s a bold vision,

04:26.760 --> 04:32.600
do I have a practical way of going from vision to reality?

04:33.440 --> 04:38.280
Yes, I will share that with you.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.560
And I will share it and indicate a tone of the meeting

04:42.600 --> 04:46.440
by ten small words.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.680
And they indicate how this global world transformation

04:51.760 --> 04:54.120
should be undertaken.

04:54.280 --> 05:05.320
And they are: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Deeds,

05:05.520 --> 05:10.560
Right Here and Right Now.

05:11.680 --> 05:20.960
The key word, the key word is, of course, “right”,

05:21.280 --> 05:24.240
this world is fighting about what is right,

05:24.360 --> 05:28.320
what is right to you might be wrong to me or vice-versa,

05:28.360 --> 05:30.200
it’s a grey area.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.240
So we need a reference point,

05:33.360 --> 05:37.720
so we can distinguish between right and wrong

05:37.840 --> 05:41.560
and between truth and lie.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.000
Tonight Shri Mataji will show us what is right.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.800
Tonight Shri Mataji will empower us

05:54.840 --> 05:59.640
to become the masters of our own destiny.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.680
And tonight we’ll be guided

06:03.720 --> 06:08.920
by the knowledge of Self Realization.

06:09.160 --> 06:14.040
We will do so in the light of Truth

06:14.400 --> 06:21.680
and we shall all know absolute truth and absolute peace.

06:21.840 --> 06:27.800
Now, 100 years ago Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.280
These prizes represent excellence.

06:31.440 --> 06:36.840
We have prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature

06:36.880 --> 06:39.320
and peace.

06:39.400 --> 06:46.920
All those prizes, I hold the peace prize to be the finest.

06:47.600 --> 06:54.080
And I want to tell you that Alfred Nobel listened to a woman,

06:54.080 --> 06:57.840
he listened to his secretary Bertha von Suttner in Paris

06:57.840 --> 06:59.920
100 years ago when she said:

06:59.920 --> 07:04.600
”Dr. Nobel, you should use your vast fortune

07:04.640 --> 07:08.040
for betterment of the world”.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.600
Tonight we are listening to another woman,

07:12.600 --> 07:17.840
we are listening to the message of Shri Mataji.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.160
However, I am very much inspired first by my uncle

07:23.360 --> 07:27.120
and later on, you will hear, by Shri Mataji.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.280
Alfred Nobel talked much about peace.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.080
He was frightened that his awesome explosive dynamite

07:36.080 --> 07:40.360
which cleared up land for harbors and tunnels

07:40.600 --> 07:43.600
could also be used for war affair.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.680
Today, in the arsenal of military systems,

07:48.680 --> 07:50.920
it’s like a small fire cracker,

07:50.920 --> 07:56.720
but at that time dynamite was a most awesome destructive material.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.920
Now, Alfred Nobel thought basically

08:00.040 --> 08:04.680
about peace as absence of war.

08:05.080 --> 08:11.440
But I assure you that peace is much more than absence of war.

08:11.840 --> 08:17.360
And I see that peace exists in four specific areas.

08:17.600 --> 08:23.320
The first area is the peace that an individual has in him or herself

08:23.520 --> 08:28.680
how do we treat our mind, our emotions and our feelings?

08:28.840 --> 08:32.240
How do we treat our body?

08:32.400 --> 08:37.320
Are we slaves to other masters

08:37.400 --> 08:39.800
or are we our own master?

08:39.920 --> 08:44.600
Until we have the inner peace in ourselves,

08:44.640 --> 08:48.280
we can never have an outer peace in the world.

08:48.360 --> 08:52.520
And the safest and best way of finding world peace

08:52.560 --> 08:58.360
is to have mass movements that include all religions and philosophies,

08:58.520 --> 09:04.760
all enterprises, whether they are of political or scientific nature,

09:04.840 --> 09:08.480
to realize what inner peace is.

09:08.560 --> 09:12.840
And that’s what we are talking about tonight: Self Realization.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.200
What does Self Realization mean?

09:15.320 --> 09:20.680
Well, it means that we are realizing something, but what is the Self?

09:20.840 --> 09:27.240
Ladies and gentlemen, the Self in us is the Divine Cosmic Power

09:27.240 --> 09:30.360
that exist in each and every individual,

09:30.360 --> 09:36.560
but which is dormant in most people around the world.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.160
The spiritual leaders from ancient lores,

09:40.200 --> 09:43.360
they knew about this and they spoke about this.

09:43.360 --> 09:49.440
But this secret of secrets has been suppressed deliberately

09:49.560 --> 09:55.120
until Shri Mataji with great courage and great wisdom,

09:55.280 --> 09:58.840
being an old soul would decided by Herself

09:58.880 --> 10:02.440
to come back to the Earth at this critical time in our history,

10:02.440 --> 10:06.040
in order to share Her knowledge and wisdom

10:06.080 --> 10:08.640
which is the Sahaja Yoga,

10:08.720 --> 10:11.720
which is instant Self Realization,

10:11.800 --> 10:15.120
which is to activate the dormant principle

10:15.160 --> 10:17.080
that we all have: the Kundalini,

10:17.120 --> 10:23.120
and have the Kundalini to rise up and thus we become

10:23.360 --> 10:30.120
what it says in the Bible: “You are created in My image”.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.120
That was the first category, first sphere of peace

10:41.200 --> 10:43.200
the one we have in ourselves.

10:43.280 --> 10:49.840
The next one is the peace that we have among each other

10:50.000 --> 10:55.200
in the family, in our community, in our nation,

10:55.400 --> 10:58.240
that we have peace with other ethnic groups

10:58.280 --> 11:00.520
and with other religions,

11:00.640 --> 11:07.280
that we really become true what I call “active listeners”

11:07.520 --> 11:11.240
And, as “active listeners” are able to put ourselves

11:11.280 --> 11:18.240
in the place, in the shoes of the other party.

11:18.360 --> 11:22.800
Only then, when we have the outlook from their perspective,

11:22.880 --> 11:26.360
shall we understand what they are trying to say.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.120
We are always talking, talking, talking.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.360
My dear wife, who is not here tonight,

11:32.440 --> 11:37.080
she said: ”Claes, you talk too much, you don’t listen”.

11:37.360 --> 11:42.800
I have start to practice what she calls “active listening”.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.360
The third sphere is a sphere that put me in, originally.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.640
After all, I am a European Swedish business man,

11:50.640 --> 11:54.760
why am I up here speaking the language of spirituality

11:54.800 --> 11:59.240
and saying that that is where the hope of the future exists?

11:59.440 --> 12:03.480
I am doing so, because I have a deep and profound

12:03.520 --> 12:05.600
reverence for Nature,

12:05.680 --> 12:10.240
as a Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer said.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.560
After, he add, worked and worked, trying to

12:13.680 --> 12:17.480
distil the phrase that contained everything that he knew,

12:17.480 --> 12:20.400
everything he wanted to say through his philosophy,

12:20.480 --> 12:26.400
Dr. Albert Schweitzer calling the phrase “reverence for Life”

12:26.600 --> 12:29.760
Nature is nothing but a plethora

12:29.840 --> 12:33.920
of examples of life in its multifaceted version.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.440
And I tell you, dear fellows seekers of Truth,

12:38.560 --> 12:42.600
we, humanity today, in our ignorance,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.880
in our greed and in our lust for power,

12:46.040 --> 12:48.240
we are in the process of destroying the

12:48.440 --> 12:50.920
very thing that makes this planet unique

12:51.000 --> 12:55.480
and that is Life on Earth.

13:02.240 --> 13:08.560
And, so far, we do not know of another planet in the universe

13:08.600 --> 13:11.400
that harbors this miracle.

13:11.480 --> 13:18.840
Earth is like a blue jewel in space

13:18.840 --> 13:22.520
and is only one Earth and this Earth is fragile

13:22.600 --> 13:25.360
and we must take care of her and respect her.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.800
Earth is also called Nature.

13:27.800 --> 13:32.080
We cannot break the laws of Nature,

13:32.360 --> 13:35.760
we must live by the laws of Nature.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.800
If we break them, Mother Earth will break us.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.000
And we are only one species of –

13:42.080 --> 13:47.280
we don’t know how many species we have – 5, 10, 15 millions.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.400
But this we know

13:49.440 --> 13:53.160
and this is being proven by the world foremost scientist

13:53.360 --> 13:59.760
in Harvard University U.S., Dr. Edward O. Wilson:

13:59.840 --> 14:07.200
we are today bringing to extinction 250 species per day.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.080
That is as if we are deliberately and willfully

14:11.160 --> 14:13.840
pulling out thread after thread after thread

14:13.920 --> 14:16.600
of what consists the fabric of life

14:16.680 --> 14:20.000
and Mother Nature will not let us continue doing that

14:20.080 --> 14:24.840
without correcting us as naughty children.

14:25.200 --> 14:31.520
The fourth sphere of peace is the peace that we shall know

14:31.640 --> 14:35.160
between ourselves and God.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.320
Any religion or any group

14:38.360 --> 14:42.160
who raises their arms and destroys its enemy

14:42.160 --> 14:48.280
in the name of God is not following what God has asked us to do.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.920
The world should not know of violence

14:58.080 --> 15:00.920
and the world should not know of war.

15:01.800 --> 15:06.760
I call, as you earlier heard, these four spheres of peace

15:06.840 --> 15:09.840
“Earth Ethics”

15:09.920 --> 15:13.680
And tonight we will hear more from the Holy Mother

15:13.800 --> 15:18.120
how we shall have a reference point, how we can distinguish

15:18.200 --> 15:20.880
if we have a charlatan and a fraud in front of us,

15:20.920 --> 15:25.080
or if it’s a genuine honest person.

15:26.120 --> 15:30.400
And you, dear audience, you have come here tonight

15:30.480 --> 15:33.320
from many different walks of life.

15:33.480 --> 15:40.160
And like you, I have also been seeking for the truth.

15:40.280 --> 15:46.240
I am beginning to discern truth rather clearly

15:46.560 --> 15:52.080
and let me tell you this, that I look upon life on Earth

15:52.200 --> 15:56.320
as a kind of a school, a school

15:56.360 --> 16:01.480
where we are learning perfection and purification.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.800
Now on Earth everything is interdependent,

16:05.840 --> 16:09.160
interactive and interrelated.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.400
And on Earth, as well as in Heaven, I guess

16:12.440 --> 16:14.760
every action has a reaction,

16:14.840 --> 16:19.680
every effect has a cause, every cause has an effect.

16:20.040 --> 16:25.280
And the Holy Mother, as I said, She is a highly evolved soul,

16:25.360 --> 16:29.200
She has learned from many many lives

16:29.240 --> 16:31.640
what it is all about

16:31.760 --> 16:35.720
and these what it is all about laws, the unseen laws,

16:35.760 --> 16:37.520
the spiritual laws,

16:37.560 --> 16:42.360
they’re always here and they work as infallible

16:42.400 --> 16:45.560
as the law of gravity works.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.320
It always works, all those unseen laws.

16:49.520 --> 16:55.240
It is for us to learn and perceive that law.

16:56.520 --> 17:04.200
I am very comfortable with the teachings of Shri Mataji

17:04.360 --> 17:09.640
and I am very comfortable with the Holy Mother Herself.

17:09.760 --> 17:15.840
I say so because in the Bible there is one saying

17:15.840 --> 17:22.480
among several good ones: “You shall know the tree by its fruit”.

17:22.600 --> 17:26.880
And lately, I have met young men and women

17:26.880 --> 17:29.360
in different parts of the world,

17:29.440 --> 17:32.560
and certainly from many different parts of the world

17:32.680 --> 17:38.720
and they are all shining, beautiful human individuals

17:38.840 --> 17:43.720
that radiate inner peace and balance.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.600
They are unique.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.440
You who follow or who are in a process of following

17:49.920 --> 17:53.080
will be, I think,

17:53.160 --> 17:56.200
those individuals who shall call themselves

17:56.240 --> 18:00.000
“ambassadors for the Earth”.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.520
And after tonight session is over,

18:03.720 --> 18:08.400
I’m sure that you shall see clearly

18:08.440 --> 18:11.840
how you shall distinguish between truth and lie

18:12.120 --> 18:16.440
and you shall realize that blind faith

18:16.520 --> 18:23.520
is of no value and that fanaticism and

18:26.360 --> 18:31.240
to take up violence as a last argument is of no value:

18:31.280 --> 18:35.120
eventually those things will bring you unhappiness

18:35.160 --> 18:41.280
and will bring you conflict and potential war.

18:43.640 --> 18:51.440
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we hold the future in our hands.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.000
I know that the future is in your hands

18:55.080 --> 18:57.800
I know it’s in my hands.

18:57.840 --> 19:02.320
And I also know that the future of the planet

19:02.360 --> 19:07.640
exists in the heart of the individuals.

19:07.840 --> 19:14.840
Now, I will close my remarks tonight by a fable from India.

19:15.120 --> 19:20.360
I heard it when I attended the Rio Conference ’92,

19:20.520 --> 19:24.080
that was the 20-th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference,

19:24.160 --> 19:29.520
that for the first time put on the environment on the world agenda.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.680
In Stockholm ’72 we had only two heads of states:

19:33.760 --> 19:36.600
the prime minister of India and the king of Sweden.

19:36.600 --> 19:41.840
In Rio, 20 years later, we had 110 heads of states.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.440
A marvelous declaration was drafted, “Agenda 21”.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.200
Just last week in New York there were 70 heads of state

19:50.400 --> 19:53.200
that continued with “Rio plus 5”.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.680
What is I told Sir C.P. when he asked me

19:55.680 --> 19:58.360
about how is the outcome of this conference,

19:58.360 --> 20:02.360
I said: Well, we are talking about sustainable future,

20:02.360 --> 20:05.400
for it seems to me that in UN there is much

20:05.400 --> 20:08.480
of a sustainable dialogue ongoing.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.720
Tonight we should take the action.

20:10.720 --> 20:16.600
Well, I asked the holy man from India, a white robed Acharya

20:16.640 --> 20:18.760
and I said:

20:19.360 --> 20:23.520
“Is there hope for the future?”.

20:23.680 --> 20:30.560
And he said: “Mr. Nobel, I will answer your question as follows”,

20:31.080 --> 20:36.320
and this is what he said: “When the Dear Lord had created the Earth,

20:36.400 --> 20:40.840
He was very very happy, very very very pleased,

20:40.880 --> 20:45.600
it was His finest creation in the Universe

20:45.680 --> 20:49.440
and He decided to celebrate, to have a party.

20:49.560 --> 20:56.040
And God invited in all angels and all the devils.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.040
When they were there,

20:58.080 --> 21:00.840
He toasted them and wished them welcome as a good host

21:00.840 --> 21:01.840
and said:

21:01.880 --> 21:06.360
There is only one rule that you must strictly obey while you are here

21:06.480 --> 21:09.440
having a good time. And, by the way,

21:09.600 --> 21:13.880
the best food and the best wine was served, the ambrosia and nectar.

21:14.040 --> 21:19.160
And He said: "There is one rule and that is that while you are here"

21:19.280 --> 21:26.320
celebrating My creation, you may never bend your elbows.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.400
The devils cried out and said:

21:29.480 --> 21:33.120
We don’t want any part of such party.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.080
How can we enjoy it, not bending our elbows?!

21:36.120 --> 21:38.720
So they left.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.320
Then the party started,

21:41.360 --> 21:43.880
the angels were having a jolly good time

21:44.000 --> 21:47.360
and the Dear God was very very happy.”

21:47.480 --> 21:55.480
Now, how could they eat and drink, without bending their elbows?

21:57.840 --> 22:04.880
Well, I sense that you can see what the moral of the fable is.

22:05.040 --> 22:08.240
The angels were feeding each other,

22:08.280 --> 22:12.920
they were sharing and they were caring,

22:13.080 --> 22:18.880
and that is what we shall do in the future together.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.880
Thank you very much.
