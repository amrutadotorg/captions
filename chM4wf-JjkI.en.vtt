00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.360
It’s my privilege and pleasure to introduce

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.880
the first of our distinguished guest-speakers.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.720
He bears a famous name

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
and needs very little in the way of introduction.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.600
Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and industrialist

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.600
of course, he was the man who invented dynamites

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.880
and left his fortune to be used for the Nobel Prize

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.800
himself was a bachelor,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.840
but Mr. Claes Nobel is his grandnephew.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.320
He was inspired by the work of his distinguished forebear

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.200
and has himself had the inspiration to found an organization

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.760
which is called “United Earth”, which he is still the chairman.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.880
And this organization has itself instituted a prize

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.080
in the ecological sphere

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.920
which is not one of the Nobel Prizes, there is no prize for ecology.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.720
And this prize he calls “Earth Ethics”.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.240
He met Shri Mataji last year in India

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.600
when he was the chairman of the World Philosophers conference.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.280
So without any more ado, I’dd like to

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.000
invite Mr. Claes Nobel to come on to the stage, please.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.120
Well, indeed, life is full of surprises,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.840
after all we are meeting here inspired by the message and work

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.080
by Holy Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.200
and She is not here in body, but She is here in Spirits.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.440
Also the wonderful letter that we recently heard

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.280
from ayatollah Ruhani

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.280
which speaks very highly about the work and the mission

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.680
of the Holy Mother,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.560
where he indicates the importance of women

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.400
in the world is needed here.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.400
And frankly speaking, only 36 hours ago

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.000
I did not know that I would be here

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.360
tonight at the Royal Albert Hall,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.920
addressing this audience.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.080
Still I say: Dear Holy Mother,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.120
and I also recognize her husband Sir C.P. Srivastava in the audience,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.840
and I say, most importantly: dear friends, fellow-seekers of truth,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.200
Are you out there? Because with all this light,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.120
I can only see about 20 people in front of me.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.320
So, say “yes”, if you are in here, then I know…

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.720
Ah…

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.840
Now I can see you, I can here you as well as you can see and here me.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.200
With that said, I want to say I have a vision,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.080
I have a vision for a world that is better, safer and saner

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.600
than the one that we presently are experiencing.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.360
It is a world where people live in harmony and peace with themselves

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.000
and in harmony and peace with Nature.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.480
Now, those words of vast, it’s a bold vision,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.600
do I have a practical way of going from vision to reality?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.280
Yes, I will share that with you.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.560
And I will share it and indicate a tone of the meeting

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.440
by ten small words.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.680
And they indicate how this global world transformation

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.120
should be undertaken.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:05.320
And they are: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Deeds,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.560
Right Here and Right Now.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:20.960
The key word, the key word is, of course, “right”,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.240
this world is fighting about what is right,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.320
what is right to you might be wrong to me or vice-versa,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.200
it’s a grey area.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.240
So we need a reference point,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.720
so we can distinguish between right and wrong

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.560
and between truth and lie.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.000
Tonight Shri Mataji will show us what is right.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.800
Tonight Shri Mataji will empower us

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.640
to become the masters of our own destiny.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.680
And tonight we’ll be guided

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.920
by the knowledge of Self Realization.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.040
We will do so in the light of Truth

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.680
and we shall all know absolute truth and absolute peace.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.800
Now, 100 years ago Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.280
These prizes represent excellence.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.840
We have prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.320
and peace.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.920
All those prizes, I hold the peace prize to be the finest.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.080
And I want to tell you that Alfred Nobel listened to a woman,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.840
he listened to his secretary Bertha von Suttner in Paris

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.920
100 years ago when she said:

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.600
”Dr. Nobel, you should use your vast fortune

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.040
for betterment of the world”.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.600
Tonight we are listening to another woman,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.840
we are listening to the message of Shri Mataji.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.160
However, I am very much inspired first by my uncle

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.120
and later on, you will hear, by Shri Mataji.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.280
Alfred Nobel talked much about peace.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.080
He was frightened that his awesome explosive dynamite

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.360
which cleared up land for harbors and tunnels

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.600
could also be used for war affair.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.680
Today, in the arsenal of military systems,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.920
it’s like a small fire cracker,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.720
but at that time dynamite was a most awesome destructive material.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.920
Now, Alfred Nobel thought basically

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.680
about peace as absence of war.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.440
But I assure you that peace is much more than absence of war.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.360
And I see that peace exists in four specific areas.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.320
The first area is the peace that an individual has in him or herself

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.680
how do we treat our mind, our emotions and our feelings?

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.240
How do we treat our body?

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.320
Are we slaves to other masters

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.800
or are we our own master?

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.600
Until we have the inner peace in ourselves,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.280
we can never have an outer peace in the world.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.520
And the safest and best way of finding world peace

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.360
is to have mass movements that include all religions and philosophies,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.760
all enterprises, whether they are of political or scientific nature,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.480
to realize what inner peace is.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.840
And that’s what we are talking about tonight: Self Realization.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.200
What does Self Realization mean?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.680
Well, it means that we are realizing something, but what is the Self?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:27.240
Ladies and gentlemen, the Self in us is the Divine Cosmic Power

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.360
that exist in each and every individual,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.560
but which is dormant in most people around the world.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.160
The spiritual leaders from ancient lores,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.360
they knew about this and they spoke about this.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.440
But this secret of secrets has been suppressed deliberately

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.120
until Shri Mataji with great courage and great wisdom,

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.840
being an old soul would decided by Herself

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.440
to come back to the Earth at this critical time in our history,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.040
in order to share Her knowledge and wisdom

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.640
which is the Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.720
which is instant Self Realization,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.120
which is to activate the dormant principle

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.080
that we all have: the Kundalini,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.120
and have the Kundalini to rise up and thus we become

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.120
what it says in the Bible: “You are created in My image”.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.120
That was the first category, first sphere of peace

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200
the one we have in ourselves.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.840
The next one is the peace that we have among each other

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.200
in the family, in our community, in our nation,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.240
that we have peace with other ethnic groups

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.520
and with other religions,

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:07.280
that we really become true what I call “active listeners”

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.240
And, as “active listeners” are able to put ourselves

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:18.240
in the place, in the shoes of the other party.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.800
Only then, when we have the outlook from their perspective,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.360
shall we understand what they are trying to say.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.120
We are always talking, talking, talking.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.360
My dear wife, who is not here tonight,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.080
she said: ”Claes, you talk too much, you don’t listen”.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.800
I have start to practice what she calls “active listening”.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.360
The third sphere is a sphere that put me in, originally.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.640
After all, I am a European Swedish business man,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.760
why am I up here speaking the language of spirituality

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.240
and saying that that is where the hope of the future exists?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.480
I am doing so, because I have a deep and profound

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.600
reverence for Nature,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.240
as a Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer said.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.560
After, he add, worked and worked, trying to

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.480
distil the phrase that contained everything that he knew,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.400
everything he wanted to say through his philosophy,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.400
Dr. Albert Schweitzer calling the phrase “reverence for Life”

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.760
Nature is nothing but a plethora

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.920
of examples of life in its multifaceted version.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.440
And I tell you, dear fellows seekers of Truth,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.600
we, humanity today, in our ignorance,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.880
in our greed and in our lust for power,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.240
we are in the process of destroying the

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.920
very thing that makes this planet unique

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.480
and that is Life on Earth.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.560
And, so far, we do not know of another planet in the universe

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.400
that harbors this miracle.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:18.840
Earth is like a blue jewel in space

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.520
and is only one Earth and this Earth is fragile

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.360
and we must take care of her and respect her.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.800
Earth is also called Nature.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.080
We cannot break the laws of Nature,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.760
we must live by the laws of Nature.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.800
If we break them, Mother Earth will break us.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.000
And we are only one species of –

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.280
we don’t know how many species we have – 5, 10, 15 millions.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.400
But this we know

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.160
and this is being proven by the world foremost scientist

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:59.760
in Harvard University U.S., Dr. Edward O. Wilson:

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:07.200
we are today bringing to extinction 250 species per day.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.080
That is as if we are deliberately and willfully

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.840
pulling out thread after thread after thread

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.600
of what consists the fabric of life

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.000
and Mother Nature will not let us continue doing that

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.840
without correcting us as naughty children.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.520
The fourth sphere of peace is the peace that we shall know

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.160
between ourselves and God.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.320
Any religion or any group

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.160
who raises their arms and destroys its enemy

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.280
in the name of God is not following what God has asked us to do.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.920
The world should not know of violence

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.920
and the world should not know of war.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.760
I call, as you earlier heard, these four spheres of peace

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.840
“Earth Ethics”

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.680
And tonight we will hear more from the Holy Mother

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.120
how we shall have a reference point, how we can distinguish

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.880
if we have a charlatan and a fraud in front of us,

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.080
or if it’s a genuine honest person.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.400
And you, dear audience, you have come here tonight

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.320
from many different walks of life.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:40.160
And like you, I have also been seeking for the truth.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.240
I am beginning to discern truth rather clearly

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.080
and let me tell you this, that I look upon life on Earth

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.320
as a kind of a school, a school

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.480
where we are learning perfection and purification.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.800
Now on Earth everything is interdependent,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.160
interactive and interrelated.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.400
And on Earth, as well as in Heaven, I guess

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.760
every action has a reaction,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.680
every effect has a cause, every cause has an effect.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.280
And the Holy Mother, as I said, She is a highly evolved soul,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.200
She has learned from many many lives

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.640
what it is all about

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.720
and these what it is all about laws, the unseen laws,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.520
the spiritual laws,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.360
they’re always here and they work as infallible

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.560
as the law of gravity works.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.320
It always works, all those unseen laws.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:55.240
It is for us to learn and perceive that law.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:04.200
I am very comfortable with the teachings of Shri Mataji

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.640
and I am very comfortable with the Holy Mother Herself.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.840
I say so because in the Bible there is one saying

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:22.480
among several good ones: “You shall know the tree by its fruit”.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.880
And lately, I have met young men and women

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.360
in different parts of the world,

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.560
and certainly from many different parts of the world

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.720
and they are all shining, beautiful human individuals

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.720
that radiate inner peace and balance.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.600
They are unique.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.440
You who follow or who are in a process of following

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.080
will be, I think,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.200
those individuals who shall call themselves

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.000
“ambassadors for the Earth”.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.520
And after tonight session is over,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.400
I’m sure that you shall see clearly

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.840
how you shall distinguish between truth and lie

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.440
and you shall realize that blind faith

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.520
is of no value and that fanaticism and

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.240
to take up violence as a last argument is of no value:

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.120
eventually those things will bring you unhappiness

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.280
and will bring you conflict and potential war.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:51.440
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we hold the future in our hands.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.000
I know that the future is in your hands

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.800
I know it’s in my hands.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.320
And I also know that the future of the planet

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.640
exists in the heart of the individuals.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:14.840
Now, I will close my remarks tonight by a fable from India.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.360
I heard it when I attended the Rio Conference ’92,

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.080
that was the 20-th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.520
that for the first time put on the environment on the world agenda.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.680
In Stockholm ’72 we had only two heads of states:

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.600
the prime minister of India and the king of Sweden.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.840
In Rio, 20 years later, we had 110 heads of states.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.440
A marvelous declaration was drafted, “Agenda 21”.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.200
Just last week in New York there were 70 heads of state

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.200
that continued with “Rio plus 5”.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.680
What is I told Sir C.P. when he asked me

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.360
about how is the outcome of this conference,

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.360
I said: Well, we are talking about sustainable future,

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.400
for it seems to me that in UN there is much

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.480
of a sustainable dialogue ongoing.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.720
Tonight we should take the action.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.600
Well, I asked the holy man from India, a white robed Acharya

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.760
and I said:

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.520
“Is there hope for the future?”.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:30.560
And he said: “Mr. Nobel, I will answer your question as follows”,

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.320
and this is what he said: “When the Dear Lord had created the Earth,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.840
He was very very happy, very very very pleased,

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.600
it was His finest creation in the Universe

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.440
and He decided to celebrate, to have a party.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:56.040
And God invited in all angels and all the devils.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.040
When they were there,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.840
He toasted them and wished them welcome as a good host

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840
and said:

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.360
There is only one rule that you must strictly obey while you are here

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.440
having a good time. And, by the way,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.880
the best food and the best wine was served, the ambrosia and nectar.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.160
And He said: "There is one rule and that is that while you are here"

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:26.320
celebrating My creation, you may never bend your elbows.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.400
The devils cried out and said:

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.120
We don’t want any part of such party.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.080
How can we enjoy it, not bending our elbows?!

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.720
So they left.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.320
Then the party started,

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.880
the angels were having a jolly good time

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.360
and the Dear God was very very happy.”

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:55.480
Now, how could they eat and drink, without bending their elbows?

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.880
Well, I sense that you can see what the moral of the fable is.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.240
The angels were feeding each other,

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.920
they were sharing and they were caring,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:18.880
and that is what we shall do in the future together.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.880
Thank you very much.
