03:13.338 --> 03:21.194
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

03:21.395 --> 03:28.812
that the last work of the Divine,

03:29.013 --> 03:33.888
of opening the last centre

03:36.067 --> 03:44.034
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

04:00.932 --> 04:11.728
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

04:23.211 --> 04:32.807
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

04:40.361 --> 04:51.504
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

04:51.705 --> 04:56.960
how things are worked in the heavens.

05:05.241 --> 05:14.847
It is your fortune and God’s love

05:15.048 --> 05:20.462
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

05:30.284 --> 05:34.954
Without this happening, there could not
have been

05:36.726 --> 05:45.261
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

05:53.227 --> 05:57.959
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

05:58.160 --> 06:05.757
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

06:15.100 --> 06:25.811
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

06:32.773 --> 06:41.669
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

06:46.194 --> 06:54.047
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

07:03.299 --> 07:15.307
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

07:20.229 --> 07:25.915
and, with the permutations and combinations

07:27.852 --> 07:36.741
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

07:41.660 --> 07:46.155
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

07:47.721 --> 07:57.053
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

08:07.499 --> 08:13.163
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

08:17.347 --> 08:21.663
and the whole thing came on this Earth

08:21.864 --> 08:29.555
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

08:38.708 --> 08:43.529
with such a tremendous force,

08:46.222 --> 08:53.275
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

08:59.007 --> 09:05.485
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

09:05.686 --> 09:16.416
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

09:32.050 --> 09:43.621
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

09:51.320 --> 10:01.944
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

10:07.112 --> 10:13.180
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

10:13.381 --> 10:20.277
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

10:20.486 --> 10:25.559
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

10:25.760 --> 10:41.509
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

10:51.625 --> 10:56.269
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

10:56.470 --> 11:00.996
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

11:10.806 --> 11:18.204
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

11:24.666 --> 11:27.872
on their golden seats,

11:30.327 --> 11:38.624
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

11:43.221 --> 11:46.450
like a big dome,

11:50.046 --> 11:53.098
and opened it,

11:53.728 --> 11:57.730
and then this torrential rain

12:00.414 --> 12:04.262
completely drenched me

12:08.899 --> 12:15.703
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

12:23.664 --> 12:31.376
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

12:31.577 --> 12:36.579
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

12:51.071 --> 13:00.131
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

13:05.236 --> 13:13.278
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

13:18.310 --> 13:22.637
and I became absolutely silent.

13:31.218 --> 13:38.123
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.233
But I saw all stones.

13:58.259 --> 14:07.282
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

14:12.847 --> 14:18.880
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

14:19.081 --> 14:24.813
appearing like inflated flames.

14:30.504 --> 14:38.527
It is a thing which is seen by many people

14:43.028 --> 14:50.397
but to see it pour that torrential rain

14:54.701 --> 15:00.412
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

15:03.549 --> 15:10.016
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

15:12.534 --> 15:20.347
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

15:26.848 --> 15:31.693
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

15:35.354 --> 15:41.154
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

15:46.426 --> 15:52.165
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

15:54.222 --> 15:58.984
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

15:59.192 --> 16:02.701
you cannot see its beauty;

16:08.012 --> 16:12.236
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

16:12.437 --> 16:18.589
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

16:24.407 --> 16:34.040
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

16:34.241 --> 16:41.665
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

16:52.460 --> 16:55.676
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

16:55.877 --> 17:03.022
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

17:19.634 --> 17:28.842
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

17:36.635 --> 17:48.085
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

17:55.324 --> 18:03.516
and you are drawn out to people

18:03.717 --> 18:12.443
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

18:18.873 --> 18:28.410
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

18:37.379 --> 18:43.202
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

18:49.077 --> 19:00.708
And even if you desire to ope
the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

19:06.782 --> 19:15.021
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

19:15.222 --> 19:20.049
has to be through human beings.

19:31.185 --> 19:33.940
The power could be with you,

19:34.141 --> 19:39.706
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

19:45.222 --> 19:53.644
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

19:58.099 --> 20:01.221
How to get them?

20:03.532 --> 20:06.791
How to work it out?

20:09.832 --> 20:13.909
So I started looking out for people,

20:18.625 --> 20:23.483
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

20:25.851 --> 20:31.609
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

20:34.818 --> 20:40.159
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

20:42.724 --> 20:46.976
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

20:50.176 --> 20:58.882
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

21:04.249 --> 21:08.881
And her brain would be covered with clouds

21:11.002 --> 21:14.347
and darkness.

21:15.239 --> 21:20.821
Again and again I had to enlighten it

21:22.760 --> 21:26.893
but she did not get her Realisation.

21:29.030 --> 21:35.783
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

21:39.665 --> 21:44.055
This capacity I had from childhood.

21:45.524 --> 21:50.712
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

21:54.554 --> 21:59.338
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

22:04.070 --> 22:09.189
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

22:10.945 --> 22:13.807
because I was not living in the forest,

22:14.008 --> 22:22.663
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

22:29.680 --> 22:35.336
and they were not that earnest, that
aartha,

22:37.894 --> 22:42.988
and I had to do this work among them.

22:49.386 --> 22:52.387
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

22:52.588 --> 22:56.836
and the false [one] in which they live?

23:07.325 --> 23:13.510
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

23:13.711 --> 23:20.424
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

23:25.344 --> 23:29.155
and it worked in her.

23:34.101 --> 23:37.506
That was not the happiest day,

23:40.112 --> 23:46.058
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

23:50.893 --> 23:56.003
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

24:02.925 --> 24:07.151
We had a programme in Bordi

24:08.065 --> 24:12.560
in ’70,

24:13.047 --> 24:20.012
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

24:25.352 --> 24:32.478
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

24:35.742 --> 24:40.974
and they started talking of favouritism.

24:44.157 --> 24:50.132
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

24:54.547 --> 25:01.996
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

25:06.592 --> 25:10.494
I was in a great fury.

25:12.718 --> 25:17.249
I had never gone into such a fury before

25:18.720 --> 25:22.796
and I lashed out at them.

25:26.647 --> 25:32.424
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

25:37.092 --> 25:41.339
That was the greatest moment.

25:42.658 --> 25:47.599
Then many got, one by one.

25:52.361 --> 25:55.938
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

25:56.139 --> 26:00.695
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

26:07.371 --> 26:12.412
So the mass evolution started.

26:16.944 --> 26:21.467
Sahasrara is your awareness.

26:22.469 --> 26:26.045
When it is enlightened

26:27.491 --> 26:34.776
you get into the technique of the Divine.

26:35.969 --> 26:39.403
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

26:39.604 --> 26:43.734
and the technique that you follow.

26:50.171 --> 26:59.519
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

27:09.977 --> 27:16.254
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

27:21.811 --> 27:27.854
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

27:31.449 --> 27:35.742
When your Sahasrara opens out

27:36.641 --> 27:45.102
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

27:50.643 --> 27:56.946
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

28:02.901 --> 28:11.629
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

28:16.439 --> 28:24.637
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

28:29.146 --> 28:35.260
and your nadis get enlightened;

28:39.865 --> 28:42.554
not all of them,

28:42.755 --> 28:45.326
quite a lot of them;

28:45.527 --> 28:49.998
not all the length,

28:50.817 --> 28:55.067
but quite the peripheries.

28:57.727 --> 29:02.399
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

29:04.258 --> 29:07.444
So many things happen

29:07.645 --> 29:14.468
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

29:19.613 --> 29:24.296
With the light you see their relative
positions.

29:27.624 --> 29:35.088
I mean you do not see, but it work
in your conscious mind.

29:40.923 --> 29:46.543
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

29:55.702 --> 30:03.938
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

30:09.979 --> 30:13.632
It becomes one with your attention.

30:14.667 --> 30:18.749
Wherever your attention goes

30:19.585 --> 30:23.888
you act in a collective way.

30:25.365 --> 30:31.452
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

30:33.533 --> 30:39.429
The attention itself is effective.

30:40.907 --> 30:45.845
Your attention is very important,

30:48.188 --> 30:52.701
your desires are even more important.

30:56.020 --> 31:04.166
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

31:09.424 --> 31:12.765
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

31:12.966 --> 31:20.725
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

31:28.281 --> 31:32.229
The priorities change very fast.

31:34.731 --> 31:40.191
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

31:41.939 --> 31:46.166
may not find that happening

31:49.621 --> 31:54.029
but those who are over mentally developed,

31:55.738 --> 32:01.957
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

32:04.562 --> 32:08.187
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

32:08.388 --> 32:13.046
They want to see that it is logical.

32:20.325 --> 32:25.192
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

32:29.830 --> 32:34.043
We have some people like that among us.

32:36.100 --> 32:40.167
They just became and they never questioned.

32:43.669 --> 32:46.635
They just settled down.

32:48.200 --> 32:53.222
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

32:53.443 --> 32:57.663
above all they are spiritual.

33:00.006 --> 33:02.510
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

33:02.711 --> 33:06.751
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

33:12.055 --> 33:15.350
First of all you have to put down your ego

33:15.551 --> 33:20.309
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

33:24.301 --> 33:27.866
Also the super-ego must be reduced

33:28.067 --> 33:34.929
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

33:40.605 --> 33:44.718
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

33:44.919 --> 33:52.795
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

33:59.854 --> 34:06.604
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

34:11.431 --> 34:20.253
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

34:24.818 --> 34:29.144
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

34:30.892 --> 34:34.022
it closes back.

34:34.223 --> 34:37.731
That’s like a poison.

34:38.860 --> 34:44.030
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

34:48.143 --> 34:52.264
If you go about with the poison

34:54.949 --> 34:58.715
then it again closes.

35:02.185 --> 35:09.228
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

35:10.320 --> 35:14.837
and all other problems of the ego,

35:15.038 --> 35:20.602
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

35:22.874 --> 35:27.327
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

35:27.893 --> 35:33.446
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

35:36.093 --> 35:39.054
and wrong books,

35:39.255 --> 35:42.384
from wrong parents maybe,

35:42.585 --> 35:45.848
from a wrong country,

35:48.611 --> 35:52.393
from a wrong livelihood

35:53.506 --> 36:00.630
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

36:05.805 --> 36:11.562
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

36:15.929 --> 36:18.328
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

36:18.529 --> 36:25.873
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

36:32.866 --> 36:37.512
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

36:39.197 --> 36:43.468
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

36:44.819 --> 36:50.757
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

36:50.958 --> 36:54.984
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

37:01.398 --> 37:07.618
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

37:13.691 --> 37:18.010
We have to have more and more channels

37:19.495 --> 37:25.127
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

37:29.565 --> 37:37.080
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

37:42.733 --> 37:50.550
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

37:55.853 --> 38:00.267
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

38:03.960 --> 38:08.991
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

38:15.009 --> 38:20.423
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

38:26.503 --> 38:31.753
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

38:31.962 --> 38:39.588
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

38:52.295 --> 38:55.615
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

38:55.816 --> 38:59.952
that he should not have bad company,

39:04.294 --> 39:09.191
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

39:11.899 --> 39:15.891
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

39:16.092 --> 39:22.664
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

39:31.190 --> 39:37.259
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

39:37.460 --> 39:46.604
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

39:59.017 --> 40:08.182
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

40:16.159 --> 40:20.637
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

40:22.751 --> 40:27.858
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

40:30.923 --> 40:36.264
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

40:37.607 --> 40:44.161
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

40:49.393 --> 40:54.340
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

40:57.238 --> 41:01.625
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

41:04.262 --> 41:10.631
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

41:17.918 --> 41:22.463
so all other things must drop out.

41:26.640 --> 41:31.664
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

41:35.983 --> 41:39.232
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

41:39.433 --> 41:45.920
that you can really correct yourself

41:52.611 --> 42:01.459
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

42:07.748 --> 42:13.443
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

42:16.795 --> 42:22.586
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

42:22.787 --> 42:30.222
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

42:34.256 --> 42:37.152
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

42:37.353 --> 42:43.084
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

42:51.212 --> 42:55.250
For that tolerance is needed,

42:57.530 --> 43:00.628
wisdom is needed,

43:00.829 --> 43:05.831
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

43:10.754 --> 43:13.601
which you are,

43:16.508 --> 43:20.451
and you should talk like a prophet.

43:25.127 --> 43:29.936
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

43:34.183 --> 43:40.678
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

43:41.862 --> 43:47.869
This is not insincere or acting

43:50.530 --> 43:53.691
because now you are awakened.

43:55.391 --> 44:03.026
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

44:17.914 --> 44:31.288
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

44:38.551 --> 44:48.966
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

44:54.333 --> 45:00.914
one has to watch one’s own growth.

45:03.868 --> 45:08.927
Never justify your wrongdoings.

45:13.747 --> 45:20.406
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

45:23.599 --> 45:28.176
We have no time to think about oneself.

45:31.757 --> 45:36.281
You have to think of others

45:36.482 --> 45:40.128
because others are also in your brain;

45:42.542 --> 45:46.492
and when you start thinking of others,

45:46.875 --> 45:52.649
talking to them about their resurrection,

45:55.492 --> 46:05.368
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

46:12.314 --> 46:15.919
The sensitivity will also increase,

46:16.866 --> 46:19.805
the depth will also come in.

46:20.982 --> 46:27.018
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

46:34.945 --> 46:38.880
So you have to come out of your shells

46:42.596 --> 46:46.048
and spread your wings.

46:46.811 --> 46:52.142
All small things of mind

46:55.636 --> 46:58.403
must be given up.

47:02.103 --> 47:09.429
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

47:16.365 --> 47:19.947
which has to give support,

47:20.877 --> 47:24.665
guidance, help

47:24.866 --> 47:29.718
and awakening to thousands.

47:30.795 --> 47:37.720
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

47:40.873 --> 47:47.201
establishes a new dynamism

47:48.909 --> 47:51.888
in this country,

47:53.009 --> 47:55.526
I am sure

47:56.377 --> 48:02.362
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

48:09.419 --> 48:14.263
It will resound into their brains,

48:17.845 --> 48:22.742
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

48:27.617 --> 48:33.182
and they will start thinking afresh.

48:37.540 --> 48:42.976
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

48:46.970 --> 48:55.581
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

49:00.996 --> 49:04.417
They’ll come to right conclusions.

49:07.180 --> 49:11.638
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

49:18.385 --> 49:23.032
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

49:24.931 --> 49:29.682
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

49:32.407 --> 49:35.538
The way you treat your Spirit

49:35.739 --> 49:41.353
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

49:48.847 --> 49:56.735
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

50:00.967 --> 50:06.373
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

50:11.510 --> 50:18.042
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

50:24.013 --> 50:28.608
And then you can become a subtle being.

50:30.165 --> 50:34.576
Through your conscious effort,

50:34.777 --> 50:40.934
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

50:46.743 --> 50:50.969
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

50:51.170 --> 50:58.323
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

51:04.214 --> 51:06.740
When you start developing higher and
higher,

51:06.941 --> 51:13.086
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

51:20.189 --> 51:23.559
You may not have any interest in many
things

51:23.760 --> 51:31.279
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

51:36.495 --> 51:43.024
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

51:49.383 --> 51:58.554
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

52:05.024 --> 52:11.434
So you become the master of your brain

52:12.563 --> 52:17.732
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

52:19.704 --> 52:25.673
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

52:25.874 --> 52:31.590
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

52:36.742 --> 52:41.044
And the light of that expands

52:42.102 --> 52:47.232
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

52:50.449 --> 52:54.584
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

52:54.785 --> 52:58.953
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

52:59.154 --> 53:05.356
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

53:17.896 --> 53:26.339
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

53:31.198 --> 53:35.717
their obstinacy

53:35.918 --> 53:40.101
and childish pranks.

53:42.760 --> 53:46.004
Let the man rise

53:47.484 --> 53:53.680
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

53:56.951 --> 54:05.196
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

54:15.828 --> 54:26.747
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

54:26.956 --> 54:33.528
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

54:43.185 --> 54:47.163
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

54:47.364 --> 54:52.261
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

55:02.721 --> 55:06.731
That is what is your job,

55:08.748 --> 55:14.372
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

55:18.651 --> 55:26.965
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

55:27.166 --> 55:35.881
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

55:49.556 --> 55:53.798
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

55:53.999 --> 55:59.711
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

55:59.912 --> 56:07.216
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

56:19.654 --> 56:23.446
neglected by all the deities,

56:24.805 --> 56:30.476
because human beings really went very
wrong.

56:35.850 --> 56:43.984
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

56:46.787 --> 56:51.127
because this is the attention,

56:54.129 --> 57:02.628
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

57:15.136 --> 57:21.706
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

57:25.628 --> 57:32.081
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

57:33.900 --> 57:37.578
and  towards the eternal life.

57:38.634 --> 57:43.005
Is [a] very important country,

57:44.198 --> 57:49.512
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

57:53.045 --> 57:59.824
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

58:04.675 --> 58:08.930
They have to change their methods

58:09.281 --> 58:11.789
and styles.

58:12.387 --> 58:16.492
They should be very mild, gentle

58:17.597 --> 58:21.037
and healthy people

58:23.293 --> 58:28.648
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

58:31.030 --> 58:34.750
so that when others see them

58:36.109 --> 58:39.659
[they] find that superiority in them.

58:43.533 --> 58:47.947
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

58:48.148 --> 58:51.140
I am very happy about you.

58:56.824 --> 59:00.213
May God bless you all.

59:01.136 --> 59:05.431
Now I bless all the other centres,

59:06.870 --> 59:10.781
who have prayed and are praying;

59:10.982 --> 59:16.492
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

59:17.621 --> 59:20.623
an enlightened one,

59:20.809 --> 59:25.821
that will separate them from their small
shells.

59:27.703 --> 59:32.049
Let them expand so much,

59:32.250 --> 59:39.016
that they become one with the whole.

59:39.217 --> 59:42.351
May God bless you all.

59:49.162 --> 59:52.336
May God bless you.

59:52.857 --> 59:55.762
Good (…)
