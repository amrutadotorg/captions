00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:15.150
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.970
the sense of chastity.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.639
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:33.546
There should be no bad intentions 
about any other person,

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:38.538
of relationships which are not pure.

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:49.778
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes
without any adultery, adulteration I would call it.

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:57.865
Clean eyes is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:06.453
Steadfast clean eyes, because 
your eyes are very powerful.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.997
You don't know how powerful they are.

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:23.634
So to make it that way, to practice, move
your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:25.242
You can.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.059
With your eyes you suck in.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:36.470
Even by looking at Me with the shraddha,
with the joy, you just suck it inside, My image.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.340
Put it on your Sahasrara, put 
it in your heart, you can do it.

00:01:44.912 --> 00:01:46.639
It's very joy giving.

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:52.430
When you put it in the Sahasrara, 
then you get the knowledge.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.303
When you put it in your heart, you get the joy; 
and when you put it on your liver, then

00:01:59.383 --> 00:02:04.903
you get the power of action.

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:11.143
From the photograph also 
you can do it, suck in, move it.

00:02:11.223 --> 00:02:15.837
But that is shown in the way 
you behave towards others,

00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:22.184
completely confident, gentle, no arrogance.

00:02:22.264 --> 00:02:34.823
Neither the neck up like that or like that, 
but in the center in a very dignified manner.

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:44.958
So in the culture of Sahaj,
because the spirit is the dignity,

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:49.530
is the majesty, is the glory of God.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.662
You have to judge yourself.

00:02:53.742 --> 00:03:00.623
"Did I say something which 
is not respecting my spirit?

00:03:00.703 --> 00:03:06.387
Did I do something that is not glorious?"
