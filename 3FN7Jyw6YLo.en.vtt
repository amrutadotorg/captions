00:01.000 --> 00:03.499
Diwali puja. Delphi (Greece), 7 November 1999.

00:03.619 --> 00:09.007
It is very, very fortunate and auspicious

00:09.127 --> 00:20.315
that we are celebrating the Diwali in Greece, specially in Delphi.

00:20.435 --> 00:23.345
It has a very ancient history,

00:23.465 --> 00:31.645
and as you know Athena resided here. She was the Primordial Mother.

00:31.765 --> 00:36.038
“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial.”

00:36.158 --> 00:44.457
So this place has been described, has been described

00:44.600 --> 00:49.353
even in the Puranas as “Manipur [navel] dvipa [island].”

00:49.473 --> 00:51.583
Manipur is the Nabhi.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.814
Also in Sanskrit Manipur means the Nabhi Chakra.

00:54.934 --> 00:58.738
So it’s described as the Manipur dvipa,

00:58.858 --> 01:02.336
is written “Manipur e dvipa.”

01:02.661 --> 01:06.460
Just imagine these Puranas, these ancient-time books

01:06.580 --> 01:08.821
– God knows how old they are,

01:08.941 --> 01:13.143
must be at least eight thousand or maybe more –

01:13.263 --> 01:16.735
and they have described Greece as the Manipur dvipa,

01:16.855 --> 01:21.527
is the place of Nabhi and where resides the Adi Shakti,

01:21.647 --> 01:23.352
that’s the Athena.

01:23.472 --> 01:26.030
So I mean, how it was known to them

01:26.150 --> 01:28.798
– maybe through torsion area, I would say;

01:28.918 --> 01:32.632
but it is written very clearly, and same we find here

01:32.752 --> 01:38.829
is the place of Athena which is in the Nabhi.

01:41.044 --> 01:44.908
Also Athena is the Primordial Mother,

01:45.028 --> 01:57.722
they say expressed Herself first in the sea on the Nabhi itself.

02:00.119 --> 02:05.823
From there She did all Her work.

02:05.943 --> 02:11.519
Now we can say that in Her movement,

02:12.661 --> 02:22.204
when She came down as existence She created Shri Ganesha

02:22.324 --> 02:32.432
and then She went to the right side and created Mahasaraswati,

02:33.861 --> 02:39.328
the, we can say, the whole universe, all creations She created.

02:39.448 --> 02:41.674
And then She came down,

02:42.197 --> 02:49.415
came down and settled as Kundalini;

02:49.836 --> 02:54.355
but coming down She created Mahalakshmi Principle,

02:54.475 --> 02:59.492
which is for our ascent. This was Her movement,

02:59.612 --> 03:05.007
but it is said that She incarnated in the Nabhi,

03:05.127 --> 03:12.237
because maybe after doing all this She incarnated in the Nabhi,

03:12.357 --> 03:16.948
and also we see that Ganesha’s Kundalini is in the Nabhi.

03:18.598 --> 03:23.883
She incarnated in the Nabhi, they say, because the first pure knowledge,,

03:24.003 --> 03:31.134
pure desire of a person or animal or anybody is hunger.

03:31.896 --> 03:34.055
That is in the Nabhi.

03:34.277 --> 03:43.228
And this hunger She wanted to satisfy or to direct or to handle,

03:43.767 --> 03:49.068
and that might be the reason She might have first come to the Nabhi.

03:49.799 --> 03:54.520
Now this Primordial Mother that we have as Athena

03:54.640 --> 04:03.638
also has in Her hand a Kundalini, also She has one trident.

04:03.948 --> 04:06.946
All this is sign that when She was born

04:07.066 --> 04:10.108
She knew that She has to fight the evil forces

04:10.228 --> 04:12.220
in the Nabhi Chakra.

04:13.490 --> 04:17.990
All this history is really shown very clearly

04:18.110 --> 04:21.278
in the Greek mythology,

04:21.398 --> 04:25.110
but later on this mythology took a very, very wrong path

04:25.230 --> 04:28.742
through human beings, as they know how to spoil everything.

04:28.862 --> 04:34.512
So what they did is to make all the gods and goddesses

04:34.632 --> 04:39.892
look like human beings, and so we have here,

04:44.714 --> 04:48.114
many gods which are in India,

04:48.932 --> 04:53.003
they are represented even in the Greek mythology.

04:53.123 --> 04:57.943
But the Indian gods are kept very pure and really godly and saintly,

04:58.063 --> 05:01.916
but here it was brought down to the level of human beings.

05:02.036 --> 05:04.317
And so many gods who were there

05:04.437 --> 05:09.917
were shown to be little different from Indian gods,

05:10.661 --> 05:13.126
because they made it human.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.927
It’s very surprising how it was deviated

05:19.047 --> 05:21.152
gradually from one to another.

05:21.272 --> 05:25.797
Even in India it’s done but it doesn’t stay,

05:25.917 --> 05:28.078
because we have Puranas.

05:28.198 --> 05:31.574
So every time people try to ruin it and spoil it,

05:31.694 --> 05:35.737
it goes back to the normal state because we have Puranas.

05:35.857 --> 05:41.624
But Puranas are not worshipped like Bible or like Koran

05:41.744 --> 05:44.524
or like any other such religious book,

05:44.644 --> 05:49.872
but they are just relating the history of the ancient times;

05:49.992 --> 05:55.391
and one has to just see it that it is intelligible,

05:55.511 --> 05:59.623
this can be explained, people can know about it.

06:01.694 --> 06:05.212
But the way they have described about Manipur dvipa

06:05.332 --> 06:10.743
was very much really great, and even at the time of Alexander,

06:10.863 --> 06:16.422
Greece was a very prosperous, extremely beautiful state.

06:18.842 --> 06:22.690
Because it is described by Chand Bardai,

06:22.810 --> 06:25.227
one of the poet who came with him here,

06:25.347 --> 06:29.320
and he has described into all details what things are.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.053
And he has also described that there’s a temple

06:32.173 --> 06:39.909
of the Primordial Mother, very clearly, of the Adi Shakti,

06:40.029 --> 06:42.666
and there is the Ganesha is also sitting there.

06:42.786 --> 06:45.420
He has described it in all details.

06:45.540 --> 06:52.843
Also the steps going to the temple are three-and-a-half, he says.

06:52.963 --> 06:56.736
Three are big ones and the last one is half way.

06:56.856 --> 07:02.859
And if you make, extend them to the whole world

07:02.979 --> 07:06.866
it can make a three-and-a-half coils.

07:06.986 --> 07:14.263
Also very clearly he said that there are swayambhu,

07:14.383 --> 07:16.433
swayambhu of Shri Ganesha.

07:16.553 --> 07:19.634
And also about Oracle of Delphi they say

07:19.754 --> 07:23.987
that in the Nabhi Chakra the gods speak.

07:24.107 --> 07:27.374
All this is described in India much before,

07:27.494 --> 07:31.240
much, much before Alexander came to India,

07:31.850 --> 07:34.481
and from that we can understand

07:34.601 --> 07:38.718
that there might have been much more rapport, maybe; maybe

07:38.838 --> 07:42.721
many people were going abroad or maybe coming here,

07:42.841 --> 07:45.499
or may be from the torsion area

07:45.619 --> 07:49.355
that all the Puranas were written down.

07:49.475 --> 07:53.853
So it’s absolutely an ancient place we are in,

07:53.973 --> 07:59.555
which is truthful in its description and everything, no doubt,

07:59.675 --> 08:03.309
but later on the deterioration came, took place.

08:03.429 --> 08:06.915
Also here there is question of Kundalini was there,

08:07.035 --> 08:09.546
and the chakras were painted also.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.563
But when Christianity came they said,

08:11.683 --> 08:13.603
“It’s all bogus, forget it,”

08:13.723 --> 08:16.447
and they didn’t want to see to the other side of it.

08:16.567 --> 08:21.550
And that is how it became just a kind of a history also,

08:21.670 --> 08:25.027
that was not so clean and clear.

08:29.325 --> 08:33.582
The faith in Athena subsided,

08:33.702 --> 08:37.814
faith in all the gods and goddesses also subsided

08:37.934 --> 08:41.021
and it started becoming this, actually we can say

08:41.141 --> 08:44.253
it was disappearing nicely.

08:44.373 --> 08:49.523
This was the situation of this Greece. Now again we are back.

08:49.643 --> 08:53.590
In the “Manipur e Dvipa” we are sitting down nicely,

08:53.710 --> 08:58.380
and for Lakshmi Puja, which is in the Nabhi.

08:58.500 --> 09:02.043
Lakshmi came out of water, no doubt,

09:02.163 --> 09:06.110
but Athena is the Mother of Lakshmi.

09:06.230 --> 09:14.992
She is the One who is all-pervading, and She created Lakshmi,

09:15.112 --> 09:18.087
and this Lakshmi is the One that ruled here

09:18.207 --> 09:22.852
and She was very much manifesting.

09:23.717 --> 09:28.236
And She created beautiful things here,

09:28.356 --> 09:33.975
because they were very rich people, Greeks were very rich;

09:34.095 --> 09:37.291
and they were indulging into all kinds of things,

09:37.411 --> 09:41.156
specially in business, then in shipping.

09:41.276 --> 09:46.088
Shipping is their one of the most important business,

09:46.208 --> 09:51.367
and I came with My husband here because he was a shipping man.

09:51.487 --> 09:53.982
And I was surprised that at the airport

09:54.102 --> 09:58.048
we had the minister’s wife, another minister’s wife,

09:58.168 --> 10:01.535
Prime Minister’s wife. I was surprised, normally they never go

10:01.655 --> 10:05.085
to receive any lady missus who comes.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.835
“No, no,” they said. “You see what happened

10:07.955 --> 10:12.506
that our husbands told us, ‘If you really want to see a lady

10:12.626 --> 10:18.760
who is absolutely, immaculately feminine and very auspicious

10:18.880 --> 10:22.819
and very serene, then it is Mrs. Srivastava.’”

10:22.939 --> 10:26.410
So they came to see Me, imagine them!

10:26.530 --> 10:31.067
The idea of serenity doesn’t exist now for women in the world,

10:31.187 --> 10:33.276
but these ladies came to see Me that

10:33.396 --> 10:36.538
“who is this serene lady who has come?”

10:36.659 --> 10:38.559
And they looked after Me very well,

10:38.679 --> 10:42.237
and then afterwards there was an election coming also.

10:42.357 --> 10:46.440
But I don’t forget the way they told Me and very respectfully,

10:46.560 --> 10:49.308
they said, “How did You develop this serenity?”

10:49.428 --> 10:51.962
I said, “I didn’t develop. It was just existing.

10:52.082 --> 10:57.315
I didn’t do anything to look serene or in any way work it out.

10:57.435 --> 10:59.676
There is no beauty parlor for that

10:59.796 --> 11:02.845
but it is something innate in Me,

11:02.965 --> 11:05.666
what if you think it was serenity.” She said,

11:05.786 --> 11:09.012
“No, no, all the men praised about You that

11:09.132 --> 11:13.849
‘She is a person who is, even in these horrible days,

11:13.969 --> 11:16.496
is extremely serene.’”

11:16.616 --> 11:20.555
Now Diwali is very significant because

11:20.675 --> 11:29.175
today is the darkest day, darkest night and longest night,

11:29.325 --> 11:33.377
and to end it up they put lights.

11:34.163 --> 11:38.560
Now in the atmosphere it’s all very dark, black,

11:38.680 --> 11:43.524
the sun is gone. So they put on all these lights.

11:43.644 --> 11:46.425
In the same way it is Kali Yuga.

11:46.980 --> 11:50.696
Now, Kali Yuga you can consider as one day.

11:50.816 --> 11:55.483
It’s very dark, horrible, it has lots of problems,

11:55.603 --> 11:57.887
it’s made our lives miserable

11:58.007 --> 12:00.989
and we don’t know how to move with life.

12:01.894 --> 12:07.693
At this moment what is necessary is to enlighten people.

12:07.813 --> 12:10.252
Kali Yuga at its worst now.

12:10.372 --> 12:13.732
The kind of things people are doing even in the name of God

12:13.852 --> 12:16.964
is shocking. But that is Kali Yuga,

12:17.084 --> 12:21.491
where we have lost all sense of direction.

12:21.611 --> 12:23.584
We don’t know which way we are going.

12:23.704 --> 12:26.174
All kinds of wrong things we are doing

12:26.294 --> 12:30.234
and we think it’s all right, after all what’s wrong in it?

12:30.456 --> 12:33.561
Everything you tell them – “what’s wrong?”

12:33.681 --> 12:37.600
You tell them, “Don’t do it.” They’ll say, “What’s wrong?”

12:37.790 --> 12:40.411
And that’s how every human being has very,

12:40.531 --> 12:44.835
become very individualistic. In a way he’s not,

12:44.955 --> 12:48.943
because they follow a fashion, they follow a style

12:49.063 --> 12:51.844
– I mean they are not, they are slavish –

12:51.964 --> 12:54.005
but they believe they are very independent,

12:54.125 --> 12:56.799
they are free people, they can do whatever they like.

12:56.919 --> 12:59.692
As a result of this freedom in this Kali Yuga

12:59.812 --> 13:04.283
or the idea of freedom, what has happened with them is that

13:04.403 --> 13:08.281
they have become extremely ugly.

13:08.401 --> 13:13.983
The kind of things they are doing in Kali Yuga is unbelievable.

13:14.103 --> 13:17.079
Even when they are priests, they are in the churches,

13:17.199 --> 13:21.722
this thing, that thing, they become so horribly immoral

13:21.842 --> 13:24.313
that cannot believe how can that be

13:24.433 --> 13:27.722
in the name of God, under this roof of God?

13:27.842 --> 13:31.100
But it has started, that is Kali Yuga.

13:31.679 --> 13:35.653
And this Kali Yuga has to be finished.

13:35.986 --> 13:40.943
So what do we do to remove the darkness of the night

13:41.063 --> 13:43.025
is to put lights.

13:43.145 --> 13:46.798
In the same way people should be enlightened.

13:46.918 --> 13:50.810
There should be light in the heart of people.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.956
Once they’re enlightened, this darkness

13:54.076 --> 13:57.113
from which we are suffering because of our ignorance

13:57.233 --> 14:01.702
will be finished and we’ll have the absolute knowledge.

14:01.822 --> 14:06.489
So this is a new age that they are talking about is here

14:06.609 --> 14:12.006
right now, here, that it is going to work out in such a manner

14:12.126 --> 14:17.771
that it will be all enlightened personalities together,

14:17.891 --> 14:24.501
and they’ll know what is light is, what is real knowledge, gyana.

14:24.621 --> 14:28.387
So ours is a path of knowledge:

14:28.507 --> 14:33.910
knowledge that is love, knowledge that is compassion.

14:34.030 --> 14:36.684
This is what we have to understand,

14:36.804 --> 14:42.385
that we have come into another area, arena, where

14:42.505 --> 14:50.647
all the skirmishes and the troubles of Kali Yuga cannot enter.

14:50.861 --> 14:53.281
It’s raining outside, nothing inside

14:53.401 --> 14:58.861
– it’s like that, that we are now not only free,

14:59.012 --> 15:03.404
but whatever we are doing is nothing but freedom;

15:03.524 --> 15:08.170
where we are not attached to anything that can debase us,

15:08.290 --> 15:12.440
make us lose grip over truth.

15:12.560 --> 15:16.949
When such a personality is brought in then what happens,

15:17.069 --> 15:21.132
that all these ideas of Kali Yuga will disappear.

15:21.854 --> 15:25.726
But I must say, it’s the Last Judgment at the same time.

15:25.846 --> 15:28.364
Those who accept the truth

15:28.484 --> 15:32.544
and reside in truth and grow in truth will remain,

15:32.664 --> 15:36.206
all other will be perished – is said already.

15:36.508 --> 15:41.623
Like you see a garden in which there are some trees

15:41.743 --> 15:47.755
who are nourished well, who get lot of water and love,

15:47.875 --> 15:54.114
and who give also so much to people they exist.

15:54.234 --> 15:57.667
The others are burnt down and finished.

15:57.787 --> 16:01.844
In the same way you have to first accept the love,

16:01.964 --> 16:06.286
take the love, nourish yourself with that love

16:06.406 --> 16:09.321
and then you give to others.

16:09.441 --> 16:18.098
This is a simple way you can overcome the Kali Yuga’s curses.

16:18.525 --> 16:23.469
Kali Yuga is so much full of darkness

16:23.589 --> 16:26.585
that we start hitting each other.

16:27.242 --> 16:30.410
For example you are all sitting here. Suddenly it becomes dark.

16:30.530 --> 16:33.706
You don’t know how to move, whether you are hitting others or not,

16:33.826 --> 16:36.280
with whom are you sitting, nothing, in the same way.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.288
With the darkness in the heart, darkness in the mind

16:40.408 --> 16:44.334
that you don’t know where are you, what are you doing

16:44.454 --> 16:46.900
and what you should be doing,

16:47.020 --> 16:51.714
just like going amok you go on hitting each other.

16:51.834 --> 16:56.483
This is what is Kali Yuga, and the one who recognizes it

16:56.603 --> 17:00.066
and gets out of it is the Sahaja Yogi.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.380
Otherwise you are just like other people

17:03.500 --> 17:06.517
if you are still indulging into the same periphery,

17:06.637 --> 17:13.552
in the same circles of imbalance.

17:14.766 --> 17:17.655
Now another thing with Kali Yuga is this,

17:17.775 --> 17:23.372
that even if you are hit or even if you are destroyed

17:23.492 --> 17:26.468
they just don’t blame themselves.

17:26.588 --> 17:30.820
Is a another horrible temperament one develops

17:30.940 --> 17:34.324
that you blame others, never yourself.

17:34.444 --> 17:37.835
That it is your mistake that you hit yourself.

17:37.955 --> 17:41.705
It was you did wrong and that’s what it is.

17:43.268 --> 17:47.435
This is the, what we call is the illusion, is the bhrama,

17:47.555 --> 17:49.943
and this illusion has to go away.

17:50.063 --> 17:54.084
And for Kali Yuga it is said this is the era of illusions,

17:54.204 --> 18:00.261
and this illusion, if you fall into it you are finished.

18:00.381 --> 18:04.739
But if you see the illusions then you try to seek the truth.

18:04.859 --> 18:08.186
That’s why today the seeking is very strong,

18:08.306 --> 18:11.640
because they can feel it’s an illusion.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.159
It’s not the truth, they know.

18:14.279 --> 18:17.887
And once they know it is not the truth, what do they do?

18:18.007 --> 18:19.871
They want to know what is the truth,

18:19.991 --> 18:22.789
where is the truth and they try to find it.

18:22.909 --> 18:28.189
That’s how also in this Kali Yuga the seeking has started.

18:28.309 --> 18:32.340
The story about Kali Yuga is told in also another Purana,

18:32.460 --> 18:37.581
of Damayanti Purana where Damayanti, the wife of Nala,

18:37.701 --> 18:44.166
was separated from him because of the same illusions created by Kali.

18:44.967 --> 18:54.888
So one day it happened that Nala got hold of this horrible Kali

18:55.008 --> 18:59.294
and he said, “Now I am going to strangle you and finish you off.”

18:59.414 --> 19:01.250
So Kali said, “All right, you can do it,

19:01.370 --> 19:05.013
but first listen to my importance, my mahatmya

19:05.133 --> 19:08.270
– what importance I have, why I am there.”

19:08.390 --> 19:09.837
So he waited.

19:09.957 --> 19:14.534
He said, “Now agree, if you listen to me I’ll tell you.

19:15.002 --> 19:17.983
When I will come and I will rule the world

19:18.103 --> 19:20.324
– means when there will be Kali Yuga –

19:20.444 --> 19:25.146
people will get into bhranti, means illusions.

19:25.266 --> 19:28.225
They will not know whether this is truth or not

19:28.345 --> 19:31.793
and they will then try to seek the truth.

19:31.913 --> 19:36.556
But not only the people, those who go to the jungles

19:36.676 --> 19:40.726
and those who renounce everything;

19:41.052 --> 19:46.074
but there will be another type, the same people who are doing this,

19:46.194 --> 19:53.487
who are doing this kind of seeking will, in the Kali Yuga

19:53.607 --> 19:58.730
will take birth and will be normal householders,

19:58.850 --> 20:03.677
and they’ll get into these illusions of every kind.

20:03.797 --> 20:07.222
And at that time when they get into this illusion,

20:07.342 --> 20:10.522
then only they will start seeking,

20:10.642 --> 20:15.611
realizing that it is untruth, and they will seek the truth

20:15.731 --> 20:17.878
at that time.

20:18.005 --> 20:21.491
At that time only they will get their Self Realization.”

20:21.611 --> 20:24.601
He told very clearly, I mean thousands of years back.

20:24.721 --> 20:27.930
So Kali Yuga is the time

20:28.050 --> 20:30.900
where people can get their Self Realization,

20:31.020 --> 20:34.640
they will know their Self, they will know the truth.

20:34.760 --> 20:39.310
This is said long time back and you can see now it’s happening.

20:39.430 --> 20:42.359
So this was the time meant for that,

20:42.479 --> 20:46.219
because if you are all right like in Satya Yuga and all that,

20:46.339 --> 20:50.824
so you don’t seek; you just accept, you are obedient,

20:50.944 --> 20:52.668
you are good people – finished.

20:52.788 --> 20:58.873
But in Kali Yuga you really start seeking the absolute truth,

20:58.993 --> 21:04.116
and that is why these lights depict that character

21:04.236 --> 21:08.217
or we can say that soul which are being enlightened.

21:08.337 --> 21:14.196
So you are all enlightened souls. For Me that’s the Diwali.

21:14.316 --> 21:17.847
If the people are enlightened that’s the Diwali:

21:17.967 --> 21:21.755
that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga

21:21.875 --> 21:27.562
and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga.

21:27.682 --> 21:31.551
It’s very, very symbolic I should say,

21:31.671 --> 21:34.890
that Diwali has already started.

21:35.010 --> 21:39.488
We have many lights, and we have to get more lights,

21:39.608 --> 21:45.771
not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights,

21:45.891 --> 21:49.886
why do you want? Because all must be saved.

21:50.006 --> 21:54.409
Our effort is to save everyone of them.

21:54.529 --> 21:56.634
Very difficult, it’s very difficult.

21:56.754 --> 22:01.845
But you can see now how like seeds realized souls go

22:01.965 --> 22:05.421
and plant themselves in very far-fetched places

22:05.541 --> 22:09.979
and there they prosper, become very beautiful trees,

22:10.099 --> 22:15.646
fragrant, and which are giving shade to others.

22:15.766 --> 22:19.818
That’s why you see people from all sorts of places

22:19.938 --> 22:25.250
are being awakened and they become realized souls,

22:25.370 --> 22:27.748
and they awaken others.

22:27.868 --> 22:33.584
Is all the process it’s so well built in,

22:33.704 --> 22:37.581
it looks like that and it’s working out well.

22:37.701 --> 22:40.831
The only thing which is doubtful is,

22:40.951 --> 22:43.341
how many will come to Sahaja Yoga,

22:43.461 --> 22:46.876
and how many we can salvage and save?

22:46.996 --> 22:51.377
Is the only problem and for that you should be prepared,

22:51.497 --> 22:55.633
that every one of you should decide that

22:55.753 --> 23:00.223
“I am going to save at least one soul every day,

23:00.850 --> 23:02.511
one person every day.”

23:02.631 --> 23:06.914
Supposing we are some, we have some people who are getting drowned,

23:07.034 --> 23:13.326
say, in a river or in the sea. What do you do?

23:14.072 --> 23:16.659
You all rush together to save.

23:16.779 --> 23:19.475
You go all out to save his life.

23:19.595 --> 23:22.058
In the same way we have to understand

23:22.178 --> 23:26.084
we have to save the lives of all the people,

23:26.204 --> 23:29.583
and for that we have to work very hard.

23:30.757 --> 23:36.747
Now in this rising from illusion to truth also

23:36.867 --> 23:44.254
we have certain problems which must be faced in a proper way.

23:44.374 --> 23:48.284
One of the problems that arises out of this, as they say,

23:48.404 --> 23:52.430
is the hunger. Hunger could be for money,

23:52.550 --> 23:55.952
could be for food, could be for anything.

23:56.625 --> 24:02.946
Now if there is a hunger for money

24:03.066 --> 24:06.714
is going to settle [in] you permanently

24:06.834 --> 24:12.802
because it is never satiable, you can never satisfy it.

24:13.024 --> 24:19.948
But in the modern times people are just going mad, I tell you,

24:20.068 --> 24:22.349
real mad for money.

24:23.183 --> 24:27.747
They do not care whether others have it or not,

24:27.867 --> 24:31.217
others have this convenience or not,

24:31.337 --> 24:34.823
but just like to show off, they want to show off

24:34.943 --> 24:37.131
– they’re very rich, they’re very good –

24:37.251 --> 24:40.482
and do all kinds of things with all their ego.

24:40.602 --> 24:44.091
They think, “Nothing wrong; what’s wrong? What’s wrong?”

24:44.211 --> 24:47.300
This is one of the biggest hurdles you have,

24:47.420 --> 24:52.162
is that your mind which is ego dictates,

24:52.282 --> 24:59.620
and you try to do it without even verifying

24:59.969 --> 25:02.563
what is this, what is that.

25:03.976 --> 25:08.717
So the mind is under bhranti, in illusion,

25:08.837 --> 25:12.521
and then you have many ways to understand.

25:12.703 --> 25:16.035
So I have said that in Sahaja Yoga

25:16.155 --> 25:19.106
if they want they should get their Realization,

25:19.226 --> 25:26.198
and also they can go about with their shoes anywhere they feel like,

25:26.524 --> 25:29.568
specially on the day they get Realization.

25:29.688 --> 25:31.500
It has worked wonders,

25:31.620 --> 25:34.385
because that day you are in a stronger mood

25:34.505 --> 25:36.894
and you avoid all wrong things.

25:37.014 --> 25:40.547
Now so many of you have grown up in Sahaja Yoga

25:40.667 --> 25:42.923
and are transformed completely.

25:43.043 --> 25:45.386
So very happy to see that.

25:45.506 --> 25:49.532
I haven’t worked like… I have not done much, I don’t think;

25:49.652 --> 25:53.586
I have just enlightened in a way, that’s very far-fetched,

25:53.706 --> 25:55.355
but I don’t do anything.

25:55.475 --> 25:58.354
Without doing anything if you get enlightened and if you say,

25:58.474 --> 26:01.905
“You have done it,” I can’t believe it. How can that be?

26:02.025 --> 26:05.216
I didn’t do anything, just you got your Realization.

26:05.336 --> 26:09.053
But now when I see, then I reflect

26:09.173 --> 26:12.661
and find how beautifully you people sing,

26:12.781 --> 26:17.379
how beautifully you have become sweet

26:17.554 --> 26:22.546
and how beautifully you have become friendly to each other,

26:22.666 --> 26:26.976
I am now convinced, and I feel this won’t take much time

26:27.096 --> 26:30.282
for you to establish Sahaja Yoga.

26:30.512 --> 26:36.105
It is very high time that we should understand that

26:36.225 --> 26:38.347
we have to expose ourselves

26:38.467 --> 26:42.558
to Sahaja Yoga much more often than otherwise.

26:43.931 --> 26:47.256
And you see the other problems are there also.

26:47.376 --> 26:50.971
Like they have some problems, they are saying,

26:51.091 --> 26:55.658
“Mother, there should be some written laws.” I said, “No.

26:56.499 --> 26:59.823
It is through your experience also you can know.”

26:59.943 --> 27:04.234
For example, the other day I said that there’s a Lakshmi Principle.

27:04.354 --> 27:08.524
Now let us see how the Lakshmi Principle goes out.

27:08.644 --> 27:15.175
Very simple, very easy if you want to know, it’s very simple.

27:17.699 --> 27:22.908
Because this Lakshmi is very volatile, chancala [movable].

27:24.111 --> 27:26.789
Once you give a hundred rupees to a servant,

27:26.909 --> 27:30.407
immediately he’ll go to the pub and drink :

27:30.527 --> 27:34.146
the Lakshmi is dead; as soon as you give the Lakshmi,

27:34.266 --> 27:38.107
he tries to go and drink in a pub.

27:38.227 --> 27:42.257
So you can imagine what is the situation is with this Lakshmi.

27:42.377 --> 27:46.512
She is very good but also She tempts you.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.761
She tempts you very much.

27:48.881 --> 27:53.667
So, you see, you have to watch: whatever money you have

27:53.787 --> 27:56.405
you should put in the bank or do whatever you like,

27:56.525 --> 28:01.211
but just don’t spend the whole lot. Just don’t do it.

28:01.331 --> 28:07.329
Secondly you must know also, if all the doors are closed

28:07.449 --> 28:13.177
and you get Lakshmi from one door She will stay, no doubt

28:13.297 --> 28:17.516
She will stay; if you are miserly She will stay,

28:17.636 --> 28:22.378
but She will rot because She has no outlet.

28:22.933 --> 28:26.365
So if you open the other door, you will be amazed

28:26.485 --> 28:30.653
that not only this Lakshmi can go out

28:30.773 --> 28:37.239
but also can get much more air, much more freedom from outside,

28:37.359 --> 28:39.690
because you’ve opened the other door.

28:39.810 --> 28:45.955
With one door you just experiment, nothing comes in it.

28:46.075 --> 28:49.488
You open one door, no air will come, nothing will come in.

28:49.608 --> 28:54.197
But you open the second door, then you will find

28:54.317 --> 29:00.853
that there’s gushing of currents inside the room.

29:00.973 --> 29:06.308
In the same way a person who wants to have money

29:06.428 --> 29:10.882
should first learn to spend whatever money he has.

29:11.002 --> 29:14.219
And in this Kali Yuga this is one of the blessings,

29:14.339 --> 29:19.896
because the job of Kali Yuga is to create doubts,

29:20.016 --> 29:22.628
to create illusions, bhramat

29:22.748 --> 29:27.600
so it will go on creating. But if you stick on to the truth,

29:27.720 --> 29:33.109
then it won’t work out, it won’t work out.

29:33.229 --> 29:37.678
So it is important to understand that all the time

29:37.798 --> 29:40.711
we are under a testing ground.

29:41.940 --> 29:45.781
It is a thing just to be witnessed.

29:45.901 --> 29:50.446
It’s very interesting to see how this Lakshmi

29:50.566 --> 29:54.545
wants to run away from the house of a man

29:54.665 --> 30:00.833
who is only interested in cheating,

30:00.953 --> 30:06.969
interested in grabbing, in telling lies.

30:07.089 --> 30:12.045
So this Lakshmi doesn’t stay with him. She goes away.

30:15.922 --> 30:20.188
All these things are happening around us.

30:20.308 --> 30:26.516
I am not saying this offhand, it’s all there – horrible!

30:26.737 --> 30:31.431
You see it’s to see, we have to clearly see

30:31.551 --> 30:33.648
the movement of your mind.

30:33.768 --> 30:38.008
Where is it going, where is it thinking?

30:38.128 --> 30:42.077
Lakshmi is the One, She makes you think about some things

30:42.197 --> 30:43.555
which you should not think.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.387
As I told you people will start drinking,

30:46.507 --> 30:51.980
they will to go to races, they will drink a lot

30:52.100 --> 30:54.819
– I mean they’ll do everything.

30:54.939 --> 30:59.254
Why? Because they have money, now they must spend somewhere.

30:59.374 --> 31:03.957
But they will put it into things which has no investment

31:06.250 --> 31:11.783
in the real good, in the real achievement.

31:11.903 --> 31:17.763
And that’s how we have now people who are spending so much money,

31:17.883 --> 31:21.864
so much on wasteful things.

31:21.984 --> 31:26.511
So wastefulness can never, never

31:30.158 --> 31:34.305
achieve the goal that is yours;

31:34.425 --> 31:41.023
and the goal that is yours is the fulfillment of your being,

31:41.143 --> 31:48.886
to become the Spirit. It’s very, very subtle to understand.

31:49.006 --> 31:51.958
You think you are doing nothing wrong; what’s that?

31:52.078 --> 31:55.377
– after all, while I am doing something wrong

31:55.497 --> 32:01.495
or something serious, the body should react. But no.

32:01.795 --> 32:06.016
Nothing will react, neither your mind nor your body.

32:10.496 --> 32:17.114
You see, all these years My experience has been very simple,

32:17.765 --> 32:21.221
that there are some Sahaja Yogis still involved

32:21.341 --> 32:23.976
in the Lakshmi Principle:

32:24.738 --> 32:27.986
like they want to cheat Me,

32:28.106 --> 32:31.732
they want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

32:31.852 --> 32:35.895
Then there are some people who want to do business among themselves.

32:36.015 --> 32:39.689
All of them have failed very badly,

32:39.809 --> 32:45.637
failed so badly that they are like bankrupts

32:45.757 --> 32:48.899
or they are in jail, and all kinds of things.

32:49.019 --> 32:54.886
So, never do business with a Sahaja Yogi.

32:55.878 --> 32:58.385
For Sahaja Yogi it is very important

32:58.505 --> 33:02.957
not to do any business with the Sahaja Yogis.

33:03.077 --> 33:05.889
If you understand this simple principle

33:06.009 --> 33:08.528
you will not do business with Sahaja Yoga.

33:08.648 --> 33:11.171
Of course you can’t do business with Me also.

33:11.291 --> 33:16.900
So this is a very, very simple thing in which people start doing.

33:17.020 --> 33:20.039
For example they meet, two Sahaja Yogis:

33:20.159 --> 33:27.671
one from say, from Japan, and another from say, America.

33:27.792 --> 33:30.428
And they start saying, “Oh, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

33:30.548 --> 33:35.099
I am also a Sahaja Yogi. Can you give me some, a false paper,

33:35.219 --> 33:37.948
or you can give me some report?”

33:38.068 --> 33:39.843
They go on asking you questions.

33:39.963 --> 33:43.073
“But why? We don’t want. We don’t want to do that.”

33:43.193 --> 33:45.779
They are not interested [in you?], they are interested

33:45.899 --> 33:47.467
in what you have.

33:47.587 --> 33:50.921
And this is something one has to learn

33:51.041 --> 33:57.668
very cleverly and intelligently, when people start

33:57.788 --> 34:02.525
communicating to you about the business part.

34:02.645 --> 34:06.124
In Sahaja Yoga there is no business among themselves,

34:06.244 --> 34:12.771
except they have business with Self Realization.

34:14.779 --> 34:17.735
If you understand this point, small,

34:17.855 --> 34:23.713
the money part of it which is quite illusive will disappear.

34:24.260 --> 34:29.133
It all works out beautifully if you are surrendered,

34:29.253 --> 34:34.403
but otherwise also it can be worked out,

34:34.523 --> 34:36.999
even if you are not surrendered;

34:37.119 --> 34:41.926
because you see the result and you are hurt,

34:42.046 --> 34:46.171
you are troubled, and so you give it up.

34:46.973 --> 34:53.677
So whatever happens, it’s our watching system

34:53.797 --> 34:56.926
– I should say, one of the chakras –

34:57.355 --> 35:02.336
here you can see clearly: by watching.

35:02.456 --> 35:06.750
Clearly you see how much you have gone into trouble,

35:06.870 --> 35:08.797
so you give it up.

35:08.917 --> 35:12.444
But before doing that we have a very good way

35:12.564 --> 35:18.236
of seeing through our vibrations.

35:18.356 --> 35:21.242
You just feel the vibrations and see for yourself:

35:21.362 --> 35:23.504
if the vibrations are good, well and good.

35:23.624 --> 35:26.027
If they are not all right then should know

35:26.147 --> 35:27.916
that there is something wrong.

35:28.036 --> 35:30.391
You can judge any human being you like,

35:30.511 --> 35:34.296
you can judge any pastor or if you want to see any one

35:34.416 --> 35:38.674
of these millionaires and all those things,

35:38.794 --> 35:41.800
but first you must find out:

35:41.920 --> 35:50.662
that one, is he a perfect Sahaja Yogi or not?

35:51.963 --> 35:55.325
This happens with the individuals.

35:55.445 --> 35:58.130
It can happen in the collective also.

35:58.250 --> 36:01.324
I have seen in the collective people are so much misled,

36:01.444 --> 36:04.364
and one negative person immediately knows

36:04.484 --> 36:09.021
who is the other negative, and then he gets hold of that negative

36:09.141 --> 36:11.818
and they start working together.

36:12.644 --> 36:17.657
So you have to be extremely cautious

36:17.777 --> 36:23.210
that you have got your Realization, you’ve got everything,

36:23.330 --> 36:28.056
you’ve got also lot of money in Sahaja Yoga.

36:28.381 --> 36:31.037
With all that you should know

36:31.157 --> 36:38.655
it’s a very, very good sign for thieves to walk in.

36:39.401 --> 36:42.126
So you should be very careful

36:42.246 --> 36:48.553
and don’t get charmed by all these nonsensical things.

36:48.673 --> 36:52.589
That’s what is the protection from your Mother,

36:52.709 --> 36:56.269
that She wants to protect you in this way.

36:56.389 --> 37:06.173
Our whole attitude towards life has to be that of a witness:

37:06.293 --> 37:08.676
you see everything clearly.

37:08.796 --> 37:14.561
Gradually this seeing will become so very sharp,

37:14.681 --> 37:20.216
so clear-cut, so understanding that you will be amazed.

37:20.336 --> 37:26.770
Then you will be using some thing there, anything you are using.

37:28.135 --> 37:30.804
Then you don’t have to think,

37:30.924 --> 37:33.578
only you have to know the vibrations:

37:33.698 --> 37:37.122
what are the vibrations are, what do the vibrations say,

37:37.242 --> 37:40.448
because they are there to guide you.

37:46.257 --> 37:51.151
Those who are not yet very good at vibrations

37:51.271 --> 37:54.175
should try to establish themselves.

37:54.295 --> 37:56.000
If you are not good at vibrations

37:56.120 --> 37:58.182
that means you will not judge people rightly,

37:58.302 --> 38:01.273
nor will they have knowledge properly.

38:01.392 --> 38:05.457
So first you must get your, all your vibrations corrected

38:05.578 --> 38:07.578
and also chakras corrected.

38:07.699 --> 38:15.474
After that you can see what are your associates, who are they?

38:16.299 --> 38:23.094
See actually, your mind now is so enlightened

38:23.214 --> 38:28.813
that you can straightforward see everything before you.

38:29.979 --> 38:33.729
But if you don’t use that enlightened mind

38:33.849 --> 38:39.096
you will be amazed, there are some forces of negativity,

38:39.216 --> 38:42.391
and once these forces start

38:44.010 --> 38:50.703
- You see, actually I should say we are at a juncture now

38:50.823 --> 38:54.015
that these things won’t happen any more.

38:54.135 --> 38:57.056
But when I started Sahaja Yoga it was very bad,

38:57.176 --> 39:02.300
very bad situation, and we had half-baked,

39:02.420 --> 39:11.938
quarter-baked, one-sixteenth-baked people [Laughs].

39:12.058 --> 39:15.198
And I just didn’t know how to tell them,

39:15.318 --> 39:19.211
because if I tell them anything they would just run away.

39:19.331 --> 39:21.229
They would not come to Sahaja Yoga.

39:21.349 --> 39:24.848
While in the other places like gurus, what they do,

39:24.968 --> 39:27.640
they take money and – “bas” (enough), that’s all.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.634
Now people think: ”Now we have given money to the guru,

39:30.754 --> 39:34.368
how can we leave?” Maybe they go on giving money and sticking on.

39:34.488 --> 39:36.944
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s no money involved.

39:37.064 --> 39:40.825
So they come, then they disappear.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.135
Very common; it’s very, very common

39:43.255 --> 39:46.129
that they come for a short time to Sahaja Yoga.

39:46.249 --> 39:50.893
But if they are really special people they just stick,

39:51.013 --> 39:55.136
and start seeing everything from the right angle

39:55.256 --> 39:59.299
because they are enlightened,

39:59.419 --> 40:02.946
they have grown up, they are mature.

40:03.066 --> 40:05.529
So this is how we have to come back

40:05.649 --> 40:12.255
to this horrible night of Kali Yuga through Diwali.

40:12.375 --> 40:14.576
This is what we have to do,

40:14.696 --> 40:20.805
to be humble and to find whether you are all right or not,

40:20.925 --> 40:24.709
whether you are going in the right direction or not.

40:24.829 --> 40:27.870
It is you only who can decide.

40:27.990 --> 40:32.294
With vibrations you can immediately know that you are catching,

40:32.414 --> 40:34.449
or you will know you are right.

40:34.569 --> 40:36.460
Whatever decision has to be taken,

40:36.580 --> 40:40.858
you have to use your hands fully.

40:42.167 --> 40:45.269
It’s not talking that is going to help,

40:45.389 --> 40:49.979
it’s not giving lectures that is going to help – no.

40:54.232 --> 41:00.571
It is through experimenting, through understanding,

41:00.691 --> 41:11.120
through the feelings or the deep, I should say the deep impact

41:11.240 --> 41:15.807
of everything that will communicate to you

41:15.927 --> 41:18.934
what sort of a people they are, what they are talking about,

41:19.054 --> 41:20.672
what you should do.

41:20.792 --> 41:23.183
This could be a little mental,

41:23.303 --> 41:28.712
but later on it becomes absolutely beyond the mental activity.

41:32.075 --> 41:38.457
Now as it is, I said that Kali Yuga is over,

41:38.577 --> 41:41.152
is about to finish.

41:41.272 --> 41:45.426
But still there may be people who will try to go back

41:45.546 --> 41:49.504
to this kind of normalcy, so-called.

41:49.624 --> 41:55.135
But there is a way out for all this, is simple meditation.

41:55.255 --> 42:02.547
With meditation you can achieve whatever is to be achieved,

42:03.769 --> 42:08.008
and then you’ll be surprised that we have been given

42:09.619 --> 42:13.320
very, very important thing to be done.

42:13.440 --> 42:17.930
And the most important thing is to be watchful about yourself,

42:18.050 --> 42:22.387
that I hope you are not falling into the trap of Lakshmi.

42:22.586 --> 42:28.011
The same Lakshmi that decorates you can also disfigure you.

42:29.225 --> 42:34.297
So we have to do everything to keep this beautiful Lakshmi,

42:34.417 --> 42:40.270
this decorated Lakshmi as our ideal, and it works out.

42:43.159 --> 42:50.819
Our aim is this, our ideal is this and we have to do this,

42:50.939 --> 42:58.608
so we can establish the new government, very beautiful government.

43:02.701 --> 43:10.926
Our whole attitude should be such that we have to be alert,

43:11.046 --> 43:13.426
because you become meditative.

43:13.546 --> 43:16.930
As soon as you start thinking about something

43:17.050 --> 43:21.360
you’ll become meditative. Your thinking will go away.

43:21.581 --> 43:26.167
You won’t be able to think, and then you can be lost?

43:26.668 --> 43:32.234
But no, when you are meditative then you cannot be lost. Why?

43:32.354 --> 43:40.181
Because then you have given your life in the hands of truth.

43:40.301 --> 43:45.751
You have given your hand into the hand of reality

43:45.871 --> 43:49.275
and that guides you, that protects you, that watches…

43:49.395 --> 43:53.035
that watches you, that helps you – you can never go wrong.

43:53.155 --> 43:55.333
Even if you are meditative

43:55.453 --> 43:57.855
don’t you worry, nothing will happen to you.

43:57.975 --> 44:03.977
But if you are never meditative, then it’s impossible to save.

44:04.097 --> 44:08.047
It’s impossible to save, it’s impossible to mature;

44:08.167 --> 44:13.309
you have to be very meditative to mature. That’s very important.

44:13.429 --> 44:18.142
I would say that all the Sahaja Yogis here today

44:18.262 --> 44:22.796
are doing this puja, and then there will be also

44:22.916 --> 44:28.114
another puja of enlightenment I have been called, or whatever it is;

44:28.234 --> 44:32.394
but you have to be very, very careful

44:32.514 --> 44:35.854
not to renounce your meditative mood.

44:35.974 --> 44:39.322
What you can do is to watch

44:39.442 --> 44:44.474
how far you have gone, how far you have solved your problems.

44:44.594 --> 44:46.220
As soon as you see that,

44:46.340 --> 44:51.677
immediately you become a complete realized soul.

44:53.495 --> 44:57.226
So the guideline is such that

44:57.844 --> 45:01.608
we should know that we are realized souls.

45:01.728 --> 45:04.247
And what is so important?

45:04.367 --> 45:09.711
Why have we become realized souls? Not only for our desires,

45:09.831 --> 45:12.987
for our pure desires but also for others.

45:13.107 --> 45:15.884
And in that understanding

45:16.004 --> 45:19.774
that we are not only for ourselves but for others,

45:19.894 --> 45:22.948
you become collectively conscious,

45:23.068 --> 45:26.341
and you start helping others.

45:26.461 --> 45:28.090
You’ll stand very well;

45:28.210 --> 45:31.999
otherwise you are lost and the others are also lost.

45:32.119 --> 45:37.004
This way is the way we have to really go ahead,

45:37.124 --> 45:39.341
go ahead towards the truth

45:39.461 --> 45:42.169
and bring that truth for the other people,

45:42.289 --> 45:45.590
for other people, and save them.

45:45.710 --> 45:51.742
This is how you can express your love to them, all your caring.

45:57.550 --> 46:04.818
It is a subject which is very difficult to handle, I think,

46:04.938 --> 46:13.423
because of – I should say that to talk about this subject

46:13.543 --> 46:18.634
is much easier than to assimilate this within ourselves.

46:18.754 --> 46:20.783
So now when you are listening to Me,

46:20.903 --> 46:24.656
please try that you have to meditate afterwards.

46:24.776 --> 46:28.019
In meditation you will assimilate,

46:28.139 --> 46:33.101
and the same power that you think is within you

46:33.221 --> 46:36.902
of discrimination, of giving vibrations,

46:37.022 --> 46:39.507
of doing all kinds of things out of Sahaja Yoga

46:39.627 --> 46:43.407
will be completely, continuously be acting.

46:43.527 --> 46:50.127
But if you do not meditate, if you are somewhere else,

46:50.247 --> 46:53.324
it won’t work out. It won’t work out.

46:53.927 --> 46:56.177
So today is the day to celebrate

46:56.297 --> 47:00.029
and to be happy that we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over,

47:00.149 --> 47:02.021
there is hope for the whole world,

47:02.141 --> 47:07.425
and we can save all people who are lost in the wilderness.

47:07.545 --> 47:09.380
That’s a fact, no doubt.

47:09.500 --> 47:12.503
But after that celebration and everything

47:12.623 --> 47:18.048
we should sit back on the, we can call, on the asanam or anywhere

47:18.168 --> 47:21.119
and watch what is happening;

47:21.239 --> 47:24.644
and you will be amazed that in meditation

47:24.764 --> 47:28.972
you will be revealed with all the beauties you have achieved,

47:29.092 --> 47:32.007
all kinds of things that you have achieved.

47:32.127 --> 47:37.561
And all the worries and botherations of things disappear.

47:37.681 --> 47:40.128
This should happen to you all,

47:40.248 --> 47:44.130
and this is what I request you all to have

47:44.250 --> 47:50.980
this special capacity to understand yourself.

47:53.551 --> 47:58.939
My own hope is fulfilled.

48:01.156 --> 48:06.359
To see you sitting down here I feel overjoyed,

48:07.181 --> 48:10.134
and same way you will also feel

48:10.254 --> 48:17.786
when you all will try to raise the Kundalini of others,

48:17.906 --> 48:20.289
establish them in Sahaja Yoga

48:20.409 --> 48:22.824
– to be amazed what will happen to you.

48:22.944 --> 48:27.287
It’s so joyous to give Realizations to others.

48:27.407 --> 48:29.417
For that you don’t have to do anything,

48:29.537 --> 48:31.675
to pay anything, nothing of the kind;

48:31.795 --> 48:34.880
this power you have which is awakened, that’s all.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.679
I mean, what you have to do is to,

48:36.799 --> 48:39.633
wherever you go you have to just awaken the Kundalini

48:39.753 --> 48:42.396
of the person, give Realization.

48:42.999 --> 48:47.484
Nothing needs to be done. And that’s so joy-giving,

48:47.604 --> 48:49.939
you feel so happy about it.

48:50.059 --> 48:54.449
So today I bless you all with this special power

48:54.569 --> 48:57.572
that you give Realization to people

48:57.692 --> 49:02.467
and look after the Nabhi of the people, and whatever it is.

49:03.872 --> 49:11.101
It is very, very important to understand how far you can go.

49:11.656 --> 49:15.646
We have to change the world, we have to save the world.

49:15.766 --> 49:18.276
It’s your responsibility.

49:18.396 --> 49:22.415
You have got Realization, not the others,

49:22.535 --> 49:25.350
so don’t try to find faults with others.

49:25.470 --> 49:29.045
Think about you, that you have Realization

49:29.165 --> 49:35.978
and it is expected that you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

49:37.271 --> 49:40.496
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

49:40.616 --> 49:44.257
Today, I’m getting so meditative that I don’t know!

49:50.240 --> 49:52.183
May God bless you all.
