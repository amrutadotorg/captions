HOW TO OVERCOME LAZINESS
1982-11-01, London (UK) - Excerpts

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:24.800
So, try to see why we sleep so much.

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:33.303
If the left side is strong, people sleep.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.376
If the back Agnya is strong, people sleep.

00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:44.846
If the front Agnya is working too much

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.769
then people don’t sleep.

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:53.910
So even if I say, “Don’t sleep,” it means

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:58.042
that you put your right Agnya in working
condition,

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:02.590
that means you start thinking, which is
against Sahaj Yoga again.

00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:05.629
So it would be left Agnya - right Agnya,
right Agnya - left Agnya,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.217
right Agnya - left Agnya. It will be going
from one to another.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:17.345
So in the centre you have to be

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:21.635
with Christ...

00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:29.444
So now, as many of you are already feeling
sleepy, put your….

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:32.489
First thing should be for all those people
who are lazy,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.880
is to put their right to the left seven
times – let’s have it…

00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:42.688
With the right hand…

00:01:57.712 --> 00:01:59.923
Is better?

00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:05.325
Now the back Agnya. Let’s have it.

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:10.235
Laziness is first.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:16.006
Shri Krishna was against laziness. I mean,
anywhere He got a chance

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:20.429
He talked against laziness, Alasya.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.359
Now watch Me.

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:27.710
On the photograph you can do the same…

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:27.030
Better now?

00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:35.150
Tonight we have to keep awake. Big problem.

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:41.357
But don’t sleep formally here, all right?
Informally you can.

00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:57.371
Better?

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.798
Put your eyes, try it…

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.984
Again.
