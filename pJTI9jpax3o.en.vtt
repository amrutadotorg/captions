HOW TO OVERCOME LAZINESS
1982-11-01, London (UK) - Excerpts

00:17.635 --> 00:24.800
So, try to see why we sleep so much.

00:28.863 --> 00:33.303
If the left side is strong, people sleep.

00:33.834 --> 00:37.376
If the back Agnya is strong, people sleep.

00:37.577 --> 00:44.846
If the front Agnya is working too much

00:45.078 --> 00:47.769
then people don’t sleep.

00:49.544 --> 00:53.910
So even if I say, “Don’t sleep,” it means

00:54.111 --> 00:58.042
that you put your right Agnya in working
condition,

00:58.258 --> 01:02.590
that means you start thinking, which is
against Sahaj Yoga again.

01:03.416 --> 01:05.629
So it would be left Agnya - right Agnya,
right Agnya - left Agnya,

01:05.830 --> 01:10.217
right Agnya - left Agnya. It will be going
from one to another.

01:11.937 --> 01:17.345
So in the centre you have to be

01:19.424 --> 01:21.635
with Christ...

01:24.531 --> 01:29.444
So now, as many of you are already feeling
sleepy, put your….

01:29.645 --> 01:32.489
First thing should be for all those people
who are lazy,

01:32.690 --> 01:36.880
is to put their right to the left seven
times – let’s have it…

01:40.524 --> 01:42.688
With the right hand…

01:57.712 --> 01:59.923
Is better?

02:01.411 --> 02:05.325
Now the back Agnya. Let’s have it.

02:07.882 --> 02:10.235
Laziness is first.

02:12.755 --> 02:16.006
Shri Krishna was against laziness. I mean,
anywhere He got a chance

02:16.207 --> 02:20.429
He talked against laziness, Alasya.

02:22.133 --> 02:24.359
Now watch Me.

02:24.583 --> 02:27.710
On the photograph you can do the same…

03:24.967 --> 03:27.030
Better now?

03:30.181 --> 03:35.150
Tonight we have to keep awake. Big problem.

03:35.935 --> 03:41.357
But don’t sleep formally here, all right?
Informally you can.

03:55.317 --> 03:57.371
Better?

03:59.189 --> 04:02.798
Put your eyes, try it…

04:16.799 --> 04:18.984
Again.
