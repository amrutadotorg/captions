WEBVTT

00:02.595 --> 00:07.220
Today we have gathered here

00:09.554 --> 00:12.429
to do the Devi Puja.

00:16.637 --> 00:22.345
This puja was performed many a times

00:23.679 --> 00:30.220
and the Devi was requested

00:33.012 --> 00:35.721
by the Devas to save them

00:38.178 --> 00:45.262
from the  tyranny of devilish people.

00:48.679 --> 00:53.679
Today I feel the same way,

00:54.595 --> 00:59.303
that we are now in the grip

01:00.345 --> 01:06.512
of a funny situation; that

01:08.137 --> 01:15.220
there are people who are themselves devils inside them

01:16.721 --> 01:21.095
and also mesmerised by them --

01:23.387 --> 01:30.220
who are trying to do something which they should never have done.

01:36.220 --> 01:41.012
But they don't know that

01:43.512 --> 01:46.595
there is a climax of everything.

01:47.679 --> 01:50.554
And that point has arrived

01:52.345 --> 01:56.595
where all the good people,

01:57.721 --> 02:03.137
especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind

02:03.637 --> 02:09.345
to the destruction of these horrible

02:10.095 --> 02:13.554
personalities like Mahishasura.

02:15.721 --> 02:23.220
In those days, it was very simple

02:24.554 --> 02:28.512
because devils came as devils

02:29.679 --> 02:34.470
and you could see them, that they are devils,

02:35.470 --> 02:41.137
and all their behaviour proved that they were devils.

02:42.178 --> 02:46.345
Why they did it?  Why were they cruel?

02:47.220 --> 02:53.095
Because so called 'human beings' as they are

02:54.220 --> 02:59.220
-- they are not -- they are by nature devilish

03:00.345 --> 03:05.429
and they want to do something by which they can destroy

03:06.137 --> 03:09.053
human beings, and good human beings.

03:13.470 --> 03:20.303
It is evident that the time has come

03:21.387 --> 03:24.262
for them to be destroyed.

03:28.679 --> 03:33.512
In no way I could be against Islam

03:34.637 --> 03:38.262
and ever to criticise Muhammad Sahib.

03:40.220 --> 03:45.220
He was divine, no doubt, and tried to do divine work.

03:46.387 --> 03:52.053
But out of that divine work these stupid people have come up

03:53.595 --> 03:58.387
who accept those devilish people.

04:01.262 --> 04:08.178
You will be amazed to know that in Islam

04:09.429 --> 04:14.345
there are seventy-four groups!

04:17.679 --> 04:23.137
They say "We follow one religion" -- but they do not.

04:26.387 --> 04:28.679
Out of these,

04:30.554 --> 04:34.595
some of them are really evil people,

04:38.053 --> 04:41.095
and they call themselves

04:42.095 --> 04:46.012
by the name as Devbandhis because this is a place in India,

04:47.721 --> 04:50.345
and also they are called as Wahhabis.

04:53.095 --> 04:57.053
I have been knowing them since long

04:59.178 --> 05:03.137
because in our household, in my father's household,

05:04.345 --> 05:08.554
we had lots of Muslim people working as cooks,

05:09.178 --> 05:14.178
as drivers, as other servants.

05:15.387 --> 05:19.095
And these Wahhabis are very interesting people

05:19.679 --> 05:23.470
because they don't believe even in Muhammad Sahib.

05:24.721 --> 05:26.387
So if you tell them

05:26.637 --> 05:29.470
that Muhammad Sahib has said such-and-such a thing,

05:29.721 --> 05:32.178
they say "No, we don't believe in Muhammad Sahib".

05:32.429 --> 05:36.387
"So, in whom do you believe?"  "We believe in Allah!"

05:37.095 --> 05:40.137
"Have you met Allah?  Have you seen him

05:40.637 --> 05:42.679
that you are believing in Him?"

05:43.512 --> 05:47.387
But in their whole behaviour

05:48.303 --> 05:52.178
it was cruelty which was innately built,

05:53.637 --> 05:59.387
very cruel; and whenever my father saw that,

05:59.595 --> 06:02.637
he asked them to get out.

06:03.637 --> 06:08.345
Because [they] always had sinister

06:09.637 --> 06:15.053
practices by which they used to treat others.

06:17.470 --> 06:21.679
I never knew that it will come up to that stage.

06:23.470 --> 06:27.220
And they are - mostly they were from Afghanistan,

06:27.387 --> 06:31.178
can you imagine? Mostly.

06:31.429 --> 06:35.637
Of course, they tortured other Afghanis also;

06:36.512 --> 06:39.137
and wherever they went,

06:40.137 --> 06:44.595
they had a speciality that they could be very cruel.

06:47.053 --> 06:52.137
Not all Afghanis, no, not at all, but some of them.

06:53.053 --> 06:57.053
And they came to India from Afghanistan

06:58.095 --> 07:02.053
and we have different types of Afghanis.

07:03.012 --> 07:09.470
Some were very loving, kind, helpful, very nice people.

07:11.137 --> 07:13.679
And some of them were very cruel.

07:15.303 --> 07:17.595
First, we didn't understand what is this.

07:19.012 --> 07:23.262
But because my father was a scholar and scholar of Islam,

07:24.470 --> 07:32.387
he told us "These are not Islamic. They call themselves Wahhabis

07:34.012 --> 07:39.721
and they are not Islamic".  I can see that today, so clearly.

07:43.721 --> 07:47.262
Not that in other

07:49.721 --> 07:54.721
religions or in other groups there are not bad people.

07:56.387 --> 08:01.303
But these Wahhabis were

08:01.554 --> 08:05.637
secretly working out different groups.

08:07.178 --> 08:13.303
They are not many.  And that's what my father had told Me

08:13.595 --> 08:18.053
"One day they will become very explosive

08:19.387 --> 08:24.679
and they might try to completely ruin the world".

08:26.137 --> 08:28.178
At first I couldn't understand,

08:29.095 --> 08:32.387
because, after all, they looked like human beings only.

08:34.178 --> 08:37.512
But he says, he told Me,

08:38.178 --> 08:41.220
"They are absolutely camouflaged,

08:43.679 --> 08:47.220
and once they start their cruelty

08:48.345 --> 08:50.554
you will not know what to do."

08:52.262 --> 08:55.512
We had one invader in our country

08:56.554 --> 08:59.053
called as Muhammad Shah Abdali.

09:00.512 --> 09:03.595
He was a very, very cruel man, very cruel,

09:05.512 --> 09:08.303
and he used to even kill the Muslims

09:09.137 --> 09:13.012
because his concept was

09:13.595 --> 09:17.262
that you should not worship Muhammad Sahib

09:19.262 --> 09:25.303
because Muhammad Sahib said that "I am not Divine".

09:25.721 --> 09:30.345
I also used to say the same, to save from the stupid people.

09:31.053 --> 09:33.637
For years I used to say "I am not Divine",

09:34.387 --> 09:39.679
but when they felt My vibrations and all that, they believed.

09:40.721 --> 09:44.137
But those who believed in Muhammad Sahib

09:45.637 --> 09:48.303
were never understood by these people.

09:50.345 --> 09:52.512
Very, very cruel,

09:53.095 --> 09:56.679
and because they don't even believe in Muhammad Sahib

09:57.637 --> 10:02.637
you cannot argue with them on any point; you cannot argue with them

10:03.429 --> 10:06.053
what is written in the Koran.

10:06.470 --> 10:08.345
Because: “Yyou don't believe in Koran,

10:08.512 --> 10:11.595
you don't believe in Muhammad Sahib you believe in Allah.”

10:12.262 --> 10:15.512
God knows from where do they have connections!

10:17.262 --> 10:20.554
But gradually it was surprising that

10:21.512 --> 10:24.429
they could mesmerize --as we have

10:24.595 --> 10:29.220
horrible gurus who come as gurus and they mesmerize,

10:30.721 --> 10:34.595
you have seen them, people being mesmerized.

10:35.387 --> 10:39.345
So many are being exposed and so many are going to be exposed.

10:40.679 --> 10:45.345
But mostly they were people

10:45.721 --> 10:48.345
who were interested in money,

10:48.721 --> 10:54.554
in getting lots of money, somehow, in the name of religion.

10:57.721 --> 11:03.679
But at that time, people didn't see their cruel methods

11:04.220 --> 11:06.470
and their cruelties.

11:07.470 --> 11:11.595
This cruelty started growing.

11:12.429 --> 11:16.387
And you know we have been to Nizamuddin Auliya ['Saint' in Arabic].

11:17.595 --> 11:22.345
In that place only I discovered there's a madharsa.

11:23.095 --> 11:25.262
'Madharsa' means a 'school'.

11:26.095 --> 11:31.387
And in that school they used to admit small children.

11:33.262 --> 11:38.679
And it was so well planned that God doesn't know --

11:39.429 --> 11:41.429
I mean I can't say

11:42.512 --> 11:47.679
that there were 120 madharsas only in Delhi!

11:49.721 --> 11:52.470
Now nobody knew what they are teaching there,

11:53.721 --> 11:58.429
what they are mesmerizing, how they are doing this.

12:01.387 --> 12:05.470
It so happened once I went to

12:07.429 --> 12:11.053
this place, Nizamuddin,

12:12.095 --> 12:16.595
and there I found people singing songs and all that.

12:19.679 --> 12:24.679
And I found in them a real feeling for love.
133
00:12:25,429
--> 00:12:28,303
They felt my love, very much, all of them,

12:29.053 --> 12:31.387
and they started coming to Sahaja Yoga.

12:33.303 --> 12:36.303
But I didn't know there was a madharsa in that place.

12:38.137 --> 12:43.012
I asked them "Why is it, here the vibrations,

12:43.554 --> 12:46.262
Nizamuddin was an Auliya.

12:47.178 --> 12:51.220
And how is that the place doesn't have good vibrations?"

12:52.178 --> 12:55.303
In between, I used to get very bad vibrations.

12:56.303 --> 12:59.721
So they told Me "Mother, there is a madharsa".

13:00.470 --> 13:03.554
Now look at the evil, how it works.

13:05.554 --> 13:10.429
Normally, evil used to work like this, that it would go and

13:13.512 --> 13:19.595
form some groups, some wars, and kill people.

13:30.053 --> 13:34.220
They were few people, but they had

13:35.554 --> 13:38.554
cruelty as their religion.

13:39.554 --> 13:46.637
Whichever way they lived, they wanted to be cruel.

13:50.137 --> 13:54.387
In those madharsas only, they had people who used to

13:55.095 --> 13:57.721
tell them how to be cruel, how to hate.

13:58.637 --> 14:02.679
So 'education in hatred' started.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.595
And that education of hatred

14:11.053 --> 14:14.554
was very well woven through these madharsas,

14:16.053 --> 14:17.721
all over the world.

14:20.721 --> 14:24.387
Now, as you know,

14:25.512 --> 14:29.429
Pakistan and India were always fighting.

14:32.303 --> 14:37.554
But this time Pakistanis realised

14:38.721 --> 14:42.178
that 'If we fight with India in that way

14:42.429 --> 14:45.178
we will be called as terrorists'.

14:47.262 --> 14:53.220
So they said "No, we will have no terrorism in our country".

14:54.554 --> 14:58.178
But they are the ones stupidly --this new fellow

14:59.095 --> 15:04.637
had sent about 65 scholars, ambassadors,

15:06.345 --> 15:11.512
to Afghanistan to study in those madharsas

15:12.220 --> 15:15.679
how to become cruel,  can you imagine!

15:18.512 --> 15:21.303
To teach hatred!

15:24.387 --> 15:27.595
Of course, there are many Muslims who are not;

15:30.137 --> 15:35.178
but if you do not respect Muhammad Sahib

15:36.554 --> 15:39.095
and you are supposed to be a Muslim,

15:39.721 --> 15:41.679
what will come out of you?

15:44.679 --> 15:48.137
So, all these wrong ideas grew up

15:48.679 --> 15:55.470
and Islam got divided

15:55.679 --> 15:57.721
into many groups.

15:59.303 --> 16:04.137
It's all right, but to have this kind of a group

16:04.637 --> 16:07.470
that is against all humanity

16:08.429 --> 16:12.095
was the most dangerous plan!

16:13.095 --> 16:18.262
I don't know how many Muslims also knew about it.

16:23.262 --> 16:28.470
They spread this 'madharsa thing' all over the world

16:29.679 --> 16:35.429
and people coming out of that institution

16:36.595 --> 16:40.053
became very, very cruel people.

16:41.429 --> 16:45.345
The first cruelty was to the women.

16:47.053 --> 16:50.303
Women were treated with such contempt,

16:52.220 --> 16:57.679
and absolutely no respect of any kind

16:58.637 --> 17:00.512
was given to them.

17:02.053 --> 17:09.470
This itself shows that there was no one to control them.

17:12.429 --> 17:18.345
It's not written in Koran, it's not described by Muhammad Sahib.

17:20.178 --> 17:25.178
He says "God is merciful;

17:28.012 --> 17:30.470
He is peace-giving".

17:34.220 --> 17:38.470
Whatever he did was absolutely divine, no doubt.

17:40.470 --> 17:45.512
But some of these people, the way they took to satanic forces,

17:49.220 --> 17:55.470
people started misunderstanding Islam.

17:57.053 --> 17:59.178
'Islam' means 'to surrender'.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.595
Those who are surrendered are you people.

18:05.303 --> 18:10.012
Surrendered means those who have given up

18:10.595 --> 18:14.470
all their lust, greed and all these enemies,

18:15.262 --> 18:21.637
and are above normal people.

18:23.429 --> 18:26.387
Another thing was very interesting

18:26.721 --> 18:29.512
to note that Muhammad Sahib had said

18:30.053 --> 18:35.178
that "At the time of Resurrection, you hands would

18:37.679 --> 18:42.470
speak". That he clearly said.

18:44.303 --> 18:47.512
Naturally, because it was written

18:49.470 --> 18:53.595
in a language which was all poetic,

18:55.387 --> 18:59.554
people can, if they want to, they can twist it.

19:02.303 --> 19:08.512
But Muhammad Sabib never, never could have said...

19:15.387 --> 19:21.137
It's very, very shocking that in these modern times

19:26.387 --> 19:30.554
that people have taken to such

19:33.345 --> 19:36.220
crooked ideas.

19:39.053 --> 19:45.345
But for that, the reason is that

19:47.512 --> 19:51.220
people also develop resistance for them.

19:54.512 --> 19:59.512
Jews -- they developed a resistance for them.

20:05.470 --> 20:10.053
This hatred is responsible,

20:11.303 --> 20:15.095
and this hatred between both the sides,

20:16.345 --> 20:22.053
I would say now, is that two different ...

20:25.178 --> 20:28.595
It's very evident.

20:34.053 --> 20:38.554
Now, in Sahaja Yoga,

20:39.595 --> 20:44.721
we believe in complete

20:46.053 --> 20:52.053
innocent, simple existence together.

20:56.262 --> 21:02.178
And that people believe

21:03.512 --> 21:09.512
that there is definitely different groups of people. ......

21:18.637 --> 21:24.470
Now what is our duty?  What are we supposed to do?

21:26.595 --> 21:31.262
First of all, we have to introspect.

21:32.262 --> 21:36.053
Supposing you are a Hindu, born,

21:38.178 --> 21:41.512
you should sit down and find out if you hate

21:41.721 --> 21:44.345
anybody because he's a Muslim.

21:46.303 --> 21:47.721
You can't hate,

21:49.220 --> 21:52.220
because somebody is a Muslim, you can't hate.

21:53.303 --> 21:57.387
Because you are a Muslim, because you are surrendered,

21:59.721 --> 22:03.595
so how can you hate anyone?

22:10.137 --> 22:15.178
If you are surrendered, you are surrendered to the Divine,

22:16.345 --> 22:20.721
and how can you then be against the Divine?

22:23.178 --> 22:27.303
So these misleading thoughts

22:28.554 --> 22:31.637
and ideas should be given up.

22:40.679 --> 22:44.137
Supposing you are a Hindu --

22:47.512 --> 22:51.387
so you should have no business to hate anyone.

22:55.178 --> 22:57.345
That is for definite!

22:57.554 --> 23:01.637
Now the word 'Hindu' also comes from the River Sindhu

23:03.053 --> 23:08.595
because Alexander [the Great] couldn't say 'Sindhu', so he said 'Hindu'.

23:10.429 --> 23:15.637
And on that point many people have built

23:16.429 --> 23:24.303
this horrible hatred in India.

23:26.262 --> 23:31.387
But cruelty was not their theme.

23:33.721 --> 23:41.429
That was the saving point.  That they didn't want to torture people.

23:44.012 --> 23:49.637
So this aptitude to torture or to hate people

23:50.262 --> 23:55.178
is coming from other sources.

23:56.220 --> 23:59.012
And the source is,

24:02.053 --> 24:07.721
as you can see clearly, that they openly hate.

24:10.470 --> 24:13.595
To hate is a very bad quality.

24:14.595 --> 24:18.262
One of the most dangerous things is to hate.

24:19.595 --> 24:22.345
And so you all must know...

24:30.303 --> 24:34.637
All right. Now we are having a ...

24:56.095 --> 25:00.429
To Me, it is very painful

25:02.137 --> 25:06.220
to think that we human beings,

25:07.262 --> 25:09.595
(that) we hate others,

25:12.053 --> 25:17.387
when you know that love is such an overwhelming,

25:18.178 --> 25:21.679
beautiful feeling.

25:24.679 --> 25:29.595
But why then do you take to hatred?

25:35.220 --> 25:39.429
Because people have

25:41.387 --> 25:46.012
impressed you, they have told you lies,

25:47.512 --> 25:51.512
that's why you hate.  What an achievement!

25:52.262 --> 25:57.637
First to be a human being, and then to be a person full of hatred!

25:59.554 --> 26:02.429
Now what will be the next, I don't know!

26:05.220 --> 26:09.178
It was all right in those days for the Goddess to kill.

26:14.303 --> 26:18.595
The Goddess used to kill all such people.

26:30.429 --> 26:34.595
It's a very sad feeling

26:36.095 --> 26:39.721
that God has created human beings

26:40.637 --> 26:47.637
from amoeba to this stage, and how can we hate someone?

26:52.554 --> 26:55.220
And this is what has happened!

26:58.137 --> 27:00.637
Now, of course, Sahaj is different,

27:02.178 --> 27:06.178
that Sahajis know how to enjoy love.

27:09.721 --> 27:12.303
They like it.

27:12.554 --> 27:16.637
They enjoy it. You can see that.

27:21.053 --> 27:25.679
And if somehow, you people

27:26.679 --> 27:29.679
could manage to remove this hatred --

27:35.595 --> 27:40.512
somehow, somehow -- with your own will-power --

27:42.429 --> 27:48.220
denying and defying all that is being told to human beings,

27:50.178 --> 27:52.637
I am sure...

27:59.220 --> 28:03.429
It's a very difficult world

28:04.595 --> 28:07.387
where those people who came

28:08.178 --> 28:11.053
on this Earth - went through all kinds of

28:11.637 --> 28:15.679
education, wanted

28:17.512 --> 28:24.387
to improve the conditions, the relationships, friendships -

28:25.387 --> 28:31.345
have fallen into the depths of hatred ...

28:49.387 --> 28:53.012
My heart just weeps.

28:56.387 --> 29:00.220
At what time I have come on this Earth,

29:01.387 --> 29:06.262
where I have to see human beings hating each other?

29:11.178 --> 29:14.429
They talk of 'love' and 'hate'.

29:17.387 --> 29:19.595
It's a very serious thing,

29:21.303 --> 29:26.303
that you who are the children ...

29:29.345 --> 29:32.345
they'll end up like this ...

29:45.345 --> 29:50.554
I mean, I have experiences that if I tell you, you'll be shocked,

29:52.262 --> 30:00.053
how people have fallen down to the depth of evil nature.

30:04.220 --> 30:09.721
It's an understanding.

30:13.429 --> 30:18.053
We have to have understanding

30:20.220 --> 30:24.679
about ourselves: do we hate somebody?

30:25.512 --> 30:30.554
Do we get ideas that we shouldn't have?

30:32.637 --> 30:37.721
Do you have such things in you?  Just find out!

30:39.220 --> 30:42.554
Do you hate other people?

30:51.679 --> 30:59.095
The ideas are rotten, absolutely, for a human mind.

31:01.679 --> 31:06.595
The ideas which are completely

31:09.178 --> 31:12.178
like the animals' instinct,

31:13.595 --> 31:18.429
are absolutely no good for human beings at all.

31:19.470 --> 31:24.220
But that is what is happening, and is coming forward ...

31:31.053 --> 31:35.345
If you are poor, all right,

31:36.303 --> 31:41.512
but by hating you don't become rich, no.

31:44.512 --> 31:49.721
If you are in any difficulties,

31:52.554 --> 31:58.470
then your duty is to remove those difficulties,

31:59.220 --> 32:01.721
but not to prosper on them.

32:04.512 --> 32:07.053
All this has to finish.

32:09.262 --> 32:14.178
It is very surprising that we are not bothered at all

32:14.679 --> 32:17.345
as to what we are doing.

32:21.637 --> 32:26.012
Yet, you have to have proper

32:27.012 --> 32:30.470
sense of understanding:

32:35.137 --> 32:37.554
where are we going?

32:42.178 --> 32:47.303
If  you have misunderstanding about somebody,

32:47.721 --> 32:50.345
better take it out, completely.

32:54.262 --> 32:56.178
They try to trouble you, all right.

32:56.387 --> 33:02.429
But don't have bad understanding about that person.

33:06.053 --> 33:12.178
Very surprising that we never see those things,

33:13.178 --> 33:19.012
how ugly they are, and how funny they are,

33:19.178 --> 33:21.554
how they ruin our personality.

33:26.178 --> 33:31.303
You may be able to correct some people ...

33:50.429 --> 33:55.512
All our activities as Sahaja Yogis,

33:56.679 --> 34:01.178
I never realised were so important!

34:03.470 --> 34:06.178
We have to give so much time!

34:11.137 --> 34:14.721
Not to bother about nonsensical, frivolous things,

34:15.303 --> 34:20.554
but something serious that is within us or without,

34:21.554 --> 34:23.721
that must be taken out.

34:30.095 --> 34:35.178
If I ask you, 'How many people you hate?'

34:36.137 --> 34:43.303
You may say '20 people' and ...

35:03.512 --> 35:11.345
Really, the whole atmosphere, nowadays,

35:12.303 --> 35:16.679
fills Me with such remorse

35:18.178 --> 35:24.095
that I just don't know what are we going to do, the Sahaja Yogis.

35:29.303 --> 35:31.679
What are their plans?

35:33.220 --> 35:38.137
Will you please look into yourself

35:39.470 --> 35:46.178
and think what constructive work we are doing

35:47.262 --> 35:51.137
and what destructive work we have been doing.

35:53.512 --> 35:56.470
You need a big shock to understand this.

35:59.595 --> 36:05.178
I like the way we have programmes and pujas and all that,

36:05.721 --> 36:08.595
but if you ask my Inner Being,

36:10.137 --> 36:14.345
I know it is very, very unhappy, very sick.

36:16.721 --> 36:22.637
At this time, what you have to do as Sahaja Yogis ...

36:27.554 --> 36:32.053
As Sahaja Yogis, minimum of minimum

36:32.429 --> 36:35.053
you should put full attention.

36:38.387 --> 36:43.470
And then you have to tell everybody ...

36:45.595 --> 36:49.345
You see, the trouble with Sahaja Yoga is

36:50.220 --> 36:53.220
that you all start enjoying yourself,

36:54.470 --> 36:58.262
and then you don't see around what is happening.

37:01.137 --> 37:05.053
Now, I must tell you

37:06.220 --> 37:13.053
I am now in the midst of war

37:14.595 --> 37:17.387
between myth ...

37:21.554 --> 37:28.012
Is it an area, is it a --

37:29.554 --> 37:33.470
I don't know what should I say --is it [that]

37:35.178 --> 37:39.429
within us there is still lurking

37:41.679 --> 37:45.721
some kind of a weakness

37:47.262 --> 37:54.262
that we do not try to fight our weaknesses.

38:01.053 --> 38:06.303
I would now request you all to meditate

38:08.512 --> 38:11.345
on yourself,

38:13.679 --> 38:20.053
and see for yourself what is wrong.

38:28.095 --> 38:34.137
It's a big shock,

38:37.387 --> 38:43.262
and to reduce this shock, what can Sahaja Yogis do?

38:46.262 --> 38:54.178
What can they work it out to blast this horrible

38:59.012 --> 39:01.220
ways of human life?

39:04.595 --> 39:09.721
It's possible with the power of love.

39:11.345 --> 39:13.595
You can manage!

39:15.095 --> 39:18.721
But we must develop that power in our hearts.

39:21.012 --> 39:27.178
Think of it!  It's a big lesson now for all of us,

39:29.053 --> 39:31.470
to see for ourselves:

39:32.512 --> 39:37.387
Are we all right?  Or we go on hating others?

39:41.512 --> 39:48.387
What is the function of our mind, is to hate or to love?

39:50.637 --> 39:56.053
And this love, if it enlightens you,

39:57.470 --> 40:01.178
you will be amazed, you will be such a big force for Me.

40:03.512 --> 40:06.595
I cannot fight the whole thing alone.

40:07.262 --> 40:10.345
And I have to have people who really

40:13.387 --> 40:20.303
develop their love -- and nothing else!

40:22.721 --> 40:27.345
That is one of the challenges now for all of us,

40:28.095 --> 40:32.053
for all the Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

40:34.095 --> 40:41.721
It's not only the fight between believers and non-believers,

40:43.012 --> 40:50.554
not only the fight between Sahaja Yogis and non-Sahaja Yogis,

40:54.095 --> 41:00.262
but this is a fight where we are all one

41:01.512 --> 41:04.429
and we are going to fight it out.

41:05.721 --> 41:11.303
At every stage we have to be much more subtler.

41:18.303 --> 41:25.387
It is very, very essential to see to the point today --

41:26.303 --> 41:33.137
are we also part and parcel of that evil thing that is working out?

41:33.679 --> 41:38.512
Or are we free from that,

41:39.303 --> 41:42.512
and prepared to fight it?

41:47.721 --> 41:53.012
It's a big fight and I hope it is conclusive!

41:54.637 --> 42:00.429
After this, there will be no more of

42:02.178 --> 42:04.512
cruelties to human beings,

42:07.178 --> 42:09.595
no more fights,

42:11.554 --> 42:17.637
because this is a fight between the rakshasas

42:18.470 --> 42:24.595
and ourselves. It is not 'ordinary'.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.512
And this has to be explained,

42:30.429 --> 42:34.470
also to those who are supportive of evil forces.

42:39.012 --> 42:44.012
Only thing, you can say, 'Mother how are we to know

42:44.387 --> 42:46.679
who is against and who is not?'

42:47.679 --> 42:53.137
You are knowledgeable; you are Sahaja Yogis,

42:54.262 --> 43:01.303
you know who is on the wrong side.

43:04.595 --> 43:07.220
I know Sahaja Yogis can save,

43:08.512 --> 43:13.595
and can bring them to the right path of knowledge and love.

43:15.095 --> 43:20.387
But, be very careful with the propaganda

43:21.554 --> 43:24.345
of evil that is going on.

43:27.637 --> 43:32.262
I want to touch the deepest part of your heart,

43:34.512 --> 43:36.721
we should reconcile.

43:42.429 --> 43:47.637
I am sure you all will understand

43:48.345 --> 43:52.679
the magnitude of danger that awaits!

43:54.679 --> 43:59.595
Maybe there may not be any human beings left,

44:00.721 --> 44:04.595
maybe there may not be any children left.

44:06.303 --> 44:10.220
Because if this kind of thing is working out,

44:12.178 --> 44:15.220
it is very difficult, very difficult  ...

44:30.637 --> 44:32.679
My whole existence

44:34.554 --> 44:39.554
gets shaky, gets shaken up.

44:41.220 --> 44:45.470
You all should see in every

44:46.220 --> 44:49.095
nook and corner of life:

44:50.303 --> 44:55.721
Where is this talk going on?  Where are people talking of cruelty?

44:56.387 --> 45:01.345
What's happening?

45:14.512 --> 45:19.262
Whatever I think,

45:25.470 --> 45:30.554
it's not one, it's not two, it's all of us.

45:46.554 --> 45:53.178
The fight that I am having is of a very serious nature, no doubt.

45:54.220 --> 46:00.387
But if you all can fight collectively, how much

46:01.554 --> 46:03.220
we can work it out!

46:17.303 --> 46:21.220
My all efforts,

46:23.137 --> 46:27.012
understandings, powers,

46:27.721 --> 46:31.178
everything is now in your hands,

46:33.679 --> 46:37.345
and that's what you should be prepared for.

46:38.595 --> 46:44.679
Not by just reading something or

46:46.178 --> 46:49.512
talking about it, you have to build up within yourself

46:50.178 --> 46:52.387
the power of love.

46:57.053 --> 47:02.262
I am sure with the opening of the Sahasrara you will do.

47:03.178 --> 47:08.345
But try to read something, to understand something,

47:09.137 --> 47:11.345
with the power of love.

47:12.637 --> 47:16.554
It's a very deep subject, and when you talk about it:

47:17.137 --> 47:19.429
“Half-way I'm inside, half-way outside.”

47:20.721 --> 47:24.345
But I have to tell you that you all develop this,

47:25.595 --> 47:32.387
and only that will form a very strong opposition

47:33.262 --> 47:36.595
to these 'evil doers' as they call it.

47:47.345 --> 47:51.345
My complete blessings are on you,

47:52.679 --> 47:58.262
and I want all of you to individually work it out.

47:59.554 --> 48:02.554
How many people you love, how many people?

48:06.429 --> 48:08.554
This you have to find out.

48:19.554 --> 48:24.429
I hope you people have understood what I want you to do.

48:34.053 --> 48:36.721
A new generation is coming up.

48:49.137 --> 48:54.053
All of you, all of you, are in my Heart,

48:57.095 --> 48:59.262
and I love you very much,

49:00.595 --> 49:02.595
and I want you people

49:05.220 --> 49:09.303
to come as soldiers to fight with Me.

49:14.721 --> 49:20.262
I am also told that there are some people who are forming groups --

49:21.053 --> 49:22.637
extremely negative attitude!

49:23.095 --> 49:27.137
At this time, what we need is a complete solidarity.

49:29.345 --> 49:34.262
So all such people whom you see, tell them to behave themselves!

49:35.721 --> 49:38.220
No use making them Sahaja Yogis.

49:43.220 --> 49:51.137
I am sure, it's really heartfelt desire of mine,

49:52.679 --> 49:58.178
that you should become really soldiers of love and peace.

49:59.429 --> 50:06.053
Because that is why you are here, you are born here for that.

50:08.178 --> 50:10.220
So enjoy yourselves.
