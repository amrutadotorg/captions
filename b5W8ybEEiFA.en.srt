1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,224
Now, eyes are very important,

2
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:16,017
and eyes, in a way, are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

3
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:25,560
because the muscles of the eyes are looked after by Vishuddhi.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,800
Now the kind of muscles we have, which pull our eyes,

5
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:34,800
which close our eyelids and all that, is very much suggestive.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,729
You must notice that there are some people who come to Me,

7
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:41,745
their eyes go on like this, when they close their eyes,

8
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,200
they cannot keep it shut.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,998
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me,

10
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:50,680
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,485
Both are in trouble.

12
00:00:53,605 --> 00:01:01,317
The ones which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

13
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:04,542
are the people having supra-conscious booths.

14
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:07,201
And those who are flickering their eyes

15
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:10,256
are having the sub-conscious problem.

16
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:14,766
Some people have also the habit of

17
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:17,521
keeping the eyes in an angle all the time,

18
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:22,346
they never see you straight but in an angle they’ll see you   .

19
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,720
They think it’s sometimes, it’s very fashionable, sometimes.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,320
Ladies think it’s a very good way of looking at people.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,920
And some of them have such eyes that they’ll go on, you know,

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,089
looking and pouring their greedy eyes onto others,

23
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,640
or their lusty eyes onto others.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,387
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes

25
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:49,188
because such people easily can become blind,

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,213
such people might have trouble of the eyes,

27
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,975
specially reddening of the eyes can come to such people,

28
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,335
very much, very quickly.

29
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,662
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure,

30
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:07,695
the eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

31
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,640
He was a witness.

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,896
He was on this earth, He played with Radha.

33
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:19,742
He married five women, they were the Five Elements.

34
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:22,566
Sixteen thousand women He married

35
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:25,040
they were His sixteen thousand Powers.

36
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,128
But He was Yogeshwara, He was Yogeshwara.

37
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,865
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them at all.

38
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:37,000
He was beyond that. He was Yogeshwara.

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
That was the testing point of His,

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,800
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
Such an Yogeshwara is there.

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,320
Of course, I don’t expect you to be Shri Krishna.

43
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:51,922
But you have your wife,

44
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:55,782
those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

45
00:02:55,902 --> 00:03:00,177
That, “We’ll get wives and we’ll have a wife”

46
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:03,320
and think of a wife who will be your own,

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,398
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

48
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:09,623
who comes across with that kind of a thing.

49
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:12,918
I have seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

50
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:15,568
it’s surprising! I mean there’s nothing in a photograph,

51
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,760
what is in a photograph?

52
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,253
But even a photograph can attract their attention.

53
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:22,247
I mean, I don’t know what can attract their attention like this

54
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,488
but they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes,

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,671
no control.

56
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,120
They become absolutely lost and they have no control.

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,800
That shows that they have no powers in them

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,921
and they are slaves of their responses.

59
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,680
So the eyes are very, very important.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,040
As Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes“.

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,334
There should be no adultery.

62
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:51,280
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see,

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,480
that they show anger they’ll just go on looking like this

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,920
and show the anger.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,046
I need, dare not, do that to you but still.

66
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:07,017
And the angry eyes, you see, are another dangerous things to do,

67
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:10,600
with your eyes, because then they can become mesmeric.

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,300
If you start putting your eyes onto something

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,720
and concentrating on it, your eyes might become mesmeric,

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,111
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

71
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,287
First of all, you’ll catch bhoots in your eyes,

72
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:23,400
they’ll settle down there and then

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,158
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

74
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:30,014
It’s a very, very dangerous thing,

75
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:35,663
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

76
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:40,023
There’s another kind of a stupid thing, or a bhootish thing maybe,

77
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:43,639
that people ask you to meditate here, it’s absolutely wrong.

78
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,133
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,120
Nobody should put attention here.

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,944
If they have to put attention, put attention at the door.

81
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:57,816
What’s the use of looking at a window?

82
00:04:57,936 --> 00:05:00,527
You can’t get out of it, can you?

83
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:04,680
If you have to look at anything, be on the lookout for the door.

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,625
And the door is here.

85
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:09,160
The door of Sahasrara is to be opened out,

86
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,932
so you should not try to concentrate on this part.

87
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,079
Many people who have concentrated on this part have become mad.

88
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,013
When they become mad, people say

89
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,207
“He’s a Yogi, but has got unmanitasha”

90
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,385
That he moves like a madcap. How can a Yogi be a madcap?

91
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:32,825
That means he’s united with God, is He mad?

92
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:36,826
All such mad people are really mad!

93
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,541
They have nothing to do with God, definitely.

94
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:42,480
But, there are people who believe in such things

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,781
“Oh, he is in love with God, so he just jumps on the stage

96
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,840
and goes into ecstasy, dances like a madcap.”

97
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,983
How can God be mad? First position is this,

98
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,128
that the sanest personality is God.

99
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:58,680
Has to be.

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,624
From where do the sanity comes in?

101
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,846
So, this is one thing one has to understand,

102
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,654
that any such practices

103
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,562
can lead you to lunacy, and one should not do it.
