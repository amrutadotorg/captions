October 5, 1981

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Public Program, Houston, Texas, USA

3
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:38,715
Yesterday I told you that God has created
us with a purpose and unless and until we

4
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:45,646
find out our purpose, unless and until we
find out our absolute, we are going to seek

5
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:49,316
and we are not going to be happy.

6
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:52,826
He has done everything, very beautifully.

7
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:56,776
Now we should understand what are we really,
inside.

8
00:01:56,776 --> 00:02:05,116
Moreover, as I explained to you yesterday,
that whatever I say is to be taken as a hypothesis,

9
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:11,876
as a scientist who would keep his mind open
and see for himself, because everything is

10
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:14,546
not known to you.

11
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:20,936
And whatever I say, you have to keep your
mind open, you need not accept Me blindly

12
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:25,156
because blind faith is of no use.

13
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:33,596
But, if you get your enlightenment, you get
your Self-realization, you actualize it, you

14
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:40,926
become, then you have to verify for yourself
whatever I say, is it true or not?

15
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:49,916
For example, if I say that the Christ, our
Lord, is placed in this center of ours, at

16
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:54,476
the Agnya Chakra, which I’ll explain to
you in details.

17
00:02:54,476 --> 00:03:04,658
You are not to believe Me that He’s placed
there, but you have to see for yourself when

18
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:08,499
you get your realization, you will be able
to raise the Kundalini of other people.

19
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:12,499
And when you start raising the Kundalini you
will find that it will stop at this point

20
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:19,299
– because you will become your own gurus,
the Kundalini will move at your fingers, and

21
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:25,689
then when you find the Kundalini has stopped
here you’ll be amazed that you will have

22
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:32,099
to ask the seeker or the subject to say the
Lord’s Prayer.

23
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,688
And that’s the only way you can get out
the Kundalini from that center.

24
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,382
It’s a mantra.

25
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:46,469
It’s a mantra, it’s a chanting, which
was given to us.

26
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:52,079
He could have given the bija mantra, the seed
of that chanting is Ham-ksham.

27
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:59,819
But, He didn’t give because He thought people
would be, specially Christians would be very

28
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,139
rational people, so He thought better give
a complete explanation of the whole thing.

29
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,319
But every word of it is a mantra.

30
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,447
But it is to be awakened; if it is not awakened,
it’s dead.

31
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:17,299
It is to be awakened, this is the basis of
Sahaj Yoga.

32
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,489
“Saha” is “born.”

33
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,305
With you, Saha-ja.

34
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,149
“Ja” means “born” and “Saha” is
“with” – is born with you, spontaneous,

35
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,664
it’s living process within you, is your
own right, you must have it.

36
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:34,589
So this is a living process and the living
happening should take place.

37
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:39,879
You should become your absolute; you should
become your own guru; you should get complete

38
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:47,419
integration within yourself; and then you
will be able to discriminate because the all-pervading

39
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,569
Power, about which I told you yesterday, is
surrounding, is everywhere, only you are to

40
00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:01,789
be awakened; once you are awakened you can
start feeling them, the existence of that,

41
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:05,599
around you, on your fingers.

42
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:13,989
Imagine on your fingers you start feeling
that Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

43
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:21,099
That should happen to all of us and the time
has come, the blossom time has come and thousands

44
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,009
must get their realization.

45
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:29,109
With this today I would explain to you the
different centers we have within ourselves

46
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:32,629
and the chakras that are within us.

47
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:38,819
I was amazed, in New York they said that people
are taking lot of money for this chakra therapy,

48
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,409
I mean I just can’t understand what they
do about it, but all those who came from this

49
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,469
chakra therapies, had all their chakras ruined
completely.

50
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:52,539
I mean, you pay to ruin your chakras, I just
couldn’t understand.

51
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,309
Anybody coming from India is not a saint,
on the contrary, as I told you, there could

52
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,883
be greatest thuggery in India.

53
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:01,347
Yes.

54
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:05,209
They are very intelligent, cunning people,
they can be very good.

55
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:13,669
If they are good, they are very, very good
and if they are bad, they are horrid.

56
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:22,229
So you have to be careful when you think of
an Indian that, as we cannot say that all

57
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:30,322
Americans are Mr. Ford, in the same way Indians
also, you must know how to discriminate.

58
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:36,192
First of all your discrimination power must
come, otherwise you won’t be able to make

59
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:40,049
out who is the real, who is not the real.

60
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,259
That must happen to you.

61
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:48,089
Unless and until that happens the rest of
it is, is of no use, because as I said this

62
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:52,909
room is dark and your eyes are closed, when
you come inside you see nothing but darkness

63
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,629
and I start telling you, “this is this,
this is this and I tell you there’s one

64
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,129
elephant you can’t see here and there’s
one tiger sitting here,” you just believe

65
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,129
it.

66
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,979
And there’s nothing like that here.

67
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:11,544
And you people are definitely much more honest
that you can’t believe how people could

68
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,717
be such fake.

69
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,968
Oh, there can be fake people all over the
world.

70
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:24,085
I am ashamed of it sometimes when I see that
in the great country of yoga, where such great

71
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:34,749
incarnations came in, such great work of the
saints has been done, horrible people also

72
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:40,642
are born in the same place because that’s
the place they want to harm, they want to

73
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:41,667
attack.

74
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:48,736
They are negative, not only negative but they
are very, very dangerous.

75
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:54,439
I may tell about them tomorrow or day after,
but today I want to tell you about the good

76
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,118
things that you are.

77
00:07:56,119 --> 00:08:00,225
The beauty that you are and how beautifully
you are made within yourself.

78
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,929
So within us, as I told you, lies this residual
power called as Kundalini.

79
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:16,471
This is the part of the all-pervading Power
which thinks, which understands, which coordinates,

80
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,687
which loves.

81
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,449
Is the integration of all these powers within
us, as this Kundalini.

82
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,981
Now so many books have been written about
Kundalini.

83
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:34,308
When I read them I was shocked that how could
people write books about Kundalini without

84
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:41,546
understanding what it meant, without understanding
where it was.

85
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:47,959
Such big books have been written on Kundalini,
which says, “The Kundalini is in the stomach,

86
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,450
some say this Kundalini’s in the nose.

87
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,458
I don’t know how could people write, I mean
it takes nothing for them to write something

88
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:59,360
and to publish, and they are not afraid of
God that they are writing all these nonsensical

89
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:01,595
things without understanding it.

90
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:05,735
So this is the Kundalini that is placed in
the sacrum bone.

91
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:11,636
Now this bone, even in English is called as
sacrum, this word comes from Greece as I told

92
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,960
you that Greek people knew about Kundalini.

93
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:16,000
Sacrum means sacred.

94
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,266
This bone is a sacred bone.

95
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:26,742
And why is it a sacred bone because the Kundalini,
the primordial desire within us to be one

96
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:32,224
with the Divine, is still unmanifested and
sleeping, and is the safest place where it

97
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:33,249
has to be.

98
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:40,922
Now you are paying attention to Me, now if
I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

99
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,542
You may say, “I’m paying attention,”
but you cannot, you cannot take your attention

100
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:44,542
inside.

101
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:49,746
But if there is some happening within you,
then your attention is drawn inside, so it

102
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:56,736
is built like this that at a human level this
happening will take place of sprouting.

103
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:02,675
And when this sprouting takes place, then
your attention is pulled inside.

104
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:09,830
This attention has gone out because of the
prismatic, as you say the prism here, prismatic

105
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:12,925
action of the brain of a human being.

106
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:18,424
I will not go into the details of it, but
there is a big science about that: why our

107
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,828
attention is outside all the time.

108
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:30,495
Now below the Kundalini, which is three-and-a-half
coils, is placed a very important center of

109
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:33,428
innocence, is the center of innocence.

110
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,945
The first thing that was emitted out of the
all-pervading Power was, it had the form,

111
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:46,435
I should say the all-pervading Power was nothing
but just innocence, which is the most powerful

112
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:50,315
thing in this world, is your innocence.

113
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:57,357
And this innocence is placed below the Kundalini,
and is adorned by the deity called as Shri

114
00:10:57,382 --> 00:11:02,174
Ganesha, who has a trunk like an elephant.

115
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:07,365
This is the bija; this is the seed of Christ.

116
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:14,155
This forms the seed, and then He incarnated
on this earth, this is the subtle form, on

117
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:23,135
this earth as Mahavishnu – is written down
in the Devi Purana – or we call Him as Christ.

118
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:28,505
The name Christ and His name Jesus also has
a very big meaning and relates to something

119
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,565
that happened before Him.

120
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:38,515
Now this great incarnation of Christ came
on this earth, which was nothing but innocence,

121
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:46,565
innocence itself took the form and it was
the all-pervading Power itself which took

122
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:51,715
the form and came on this earth.

123
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:55,935
That’s why this is a very important center,
is the beginning.

124
00:11:55,935 --> 00:12:03,655
Because it is innocence, is like a lotus and
it is placed at a point where the gate to

125
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,575
hell are open within us.

126
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:12,295
This center gives rise in the gross … Now
this is a subtle center called as Mooladhara

127
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,891
Chakra.

128
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,321
Chakra Mooladhara.

129
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:18,368
Mooladhara means the support of the root.

130
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:21,044
Now root is the Kundalini.

131
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,505
It is the support of the root.

132
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:29,455
Kundalini is the Mother, and this is your
innocence, this is your childhood and that’s

133
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:30,455
the Mother.

134
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:37,733
And the Mother is there to give you your realization,
waiting all the time, She is your own individual

135
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:45,855
Mother, and She is just waiting, ages together,
to give you the experience of Self-realization,

136
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,363
to give you your second birth.

137
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:57,013
Now the last center looks after, in the gross,
the Pelvic Plexus, which you have heard of,

138
00:12:57,013 --> 00:13:05,782
which has also got four sub-plexuses, this
has also got four petals as we call it.

139
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:07,983
There are four petals.

140
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:15,983
So this center looks after the pelvic plexus
in the gross, which looks after the excretion.

141
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:23,762
This center we must consider at length, a
little bit, which is very important to understand

142
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:33,404
that this also looks after the sex and reproduction,
mainly the sex and other excretions.

143
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:38,248
Now you can see here that it is placed below
the Kundalini.

144
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:42,728
That means sex does not play any part in your
evolution.

145
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:44,328
It does not.

146
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:50,548
Those people who say that sex has something
to do with Kundalini, are really blasphemous

147
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:58,097
and very ugly people because you cannot put
sex to your Mother.

148
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:03,507
It’s something, even today is not accepted,
when people have become so much lenient about

149
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:05,778
sex, is not accepted.

150
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:11,852
And this is what it is when people talk of
sex and Kundalini together.

151
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:18,588
As a Mother, I give them a little chance or
sort of a little grace because to say that

152
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:24,838
they originated all this from deliberate action
will be too much.

153
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:29,668
I would say that maybe they when they were
meditating, at the sex point they might have

154
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,556
seen Ganesha’s trunk which they might have
thought to be the Kundalini.

155
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:37,318
Possibly that’s how they went into a wrong
situation.

156
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:39,507
But of course it’s a very wrong thing.

157
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:47,887
We have had cases in New York and here also
where the private parts of people were touched

158
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:54,068
by some of the people, and are having a very
bad time with that action.

159
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,928
It’s your private.

160
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:01,274
It has nothing to do with sex.

161
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,688
Animals are more sex-conscious than you are;
are they going to get evolution before you

162
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:07,688
get?

163
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:13,488
Moreover, the whole thing that is worked out
in such a way that we have started having

164
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:18,588
the sex through our mental activity, which
is a wrong thing.

165
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:25,931
Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adultery,
thy should not commit adultery.

166
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:32,047
But I say, I say verily to you, ‘Thou shalt
not have adulterous eyes.’

167
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:39,328
Because He knew this would happen one day
that the sex would move from there to the

168
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:46,048
Swadisthana Chakra – the second chakra by
which we think – and then it will come into

169
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:50,168
our thinking and our eyes will start roving
around.

170
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:58,258
And then, actually the sex act minimizes,
and it becomes a big problem; I mean to be

171
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,927
a sex point itself becomes an achievement
for people then.

172
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,938
It’s such an absurd thing to do.

173
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:08,778
And this is what is a very big confusion today
in the modern times.

174
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:13,428
I mean, you cannot make compromises with Christ;
what He said is absolute.

175
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:23,217
But unless and until you understand that sex
as a married life, as a private thing, is

176
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:32,657
the one that has been sanctioned for our sustenance,
for our sustenance as human beings; that has

177
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:39,597
to be looked after, is to be respected, is
sacred.

178
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:44,188
And that’s why anything else that we try
to do, all kinds of perversions and these

179
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:50,938
things – you won’t believe that all kinds
of perversions come to us because we are no

180
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:51,978
more there.

181
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,628
Mostly we get possessed.

182
00:16:54,628 --> 00:17:01,958
We had one boy who came to us in New York
and he told me, “Mother, I…

183
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:07,418
I’m a man, I have moustaches and everything
but I want to be like a woman.

184
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:10,578
I want to be dressed up like a woman,” and
he talked like a woman.

185
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:14,148
He said, “I want to walk like a woman, I
don’t know what to do with myself.

186
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,428
I am so confused.

187
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:20,968
And I cannot have any relationship with any
woman because she gets confused with me also.

188
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:24,738
And I don’t know what is happening to me,
why I want to be like this.”

189
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:29,348
And I could see he was possessed by a woman.

190
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,788
He was just possessed by a woman, simple thing
as that.

191
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,508
Very simple, it is extremely simple.

192
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:42,998
And when that possession was removed, he said,
“I am a man again.”

193
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,335
Is so simple, in one day.

194
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,308
He is a different man altogether today, absolutely
a different personality, and it can happen

195
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,068
to a woman.

196
00:17:54,068 --> 00:18:00,448
We had somebody from Australia and she got
possessed by a man and she started talking

197
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:04,340
like that and behavior, the whole thing, her
husband got frightened, and he couldn’t

198
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:06,938
understand what’s gone wrong with this lady.

199
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:13,508
And the whole attitude, the whole beauty of
a woman was lost into the style of a man,

200
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:17,108
and it was so funny and odd to look at.

201
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:21,678
Same thing: she came to Sahaj Yoga and the
spirit ran away.

202
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:27,228
She is a beautiful woman now, extremely beautiful,
and they’re having a very good relationship.

203
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:34,978
So when you try to do anything perverted with
the sex and do not respect it, you do not

204
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:37,598
know what things are awaiting us around.

205
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:44,468
So before I go to other chakras, I want to
tell you about our other unknown areas which

206
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:48,758
are very important to us and then we’ll
go to the second chakra.

207
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:55,028
As you see here on the left hand side this
blue line is there.

208
00:18:55,028 --> 00:19:05,317
This blue line is our power of desire by which
we desire, by which God has – supposing

209
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:09,028
this is the primordial being because God has
made you in His own image – supposing it

210
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:13,318
is the image of God, then it is His desire.

211
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:21,268
This power of desire gives you existence,
and when this desire is over, when the Spirit,

212
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:28,468
which is watching the drama of this body,
gets fed up, it disappears, then the death

213
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,968
comes in.

214
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,528
This power of desire is the left side.

215
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:41,108
We call it in Sanskrit as Ida Nadi, also called
as the Moon Nadi and in the Hatha Yoga is

216
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:42,238
the Tha Nadi.

217
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,048
This is the channel, is a subtle channel.

218
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:51,418
But this gives rise to the gross channel,
which is the left sympathetic nervous system.

219
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:55,218
Now, doctors don’t believe that left and
right sympathetic nervous systems are two

220
00:19:55,218 --> 00:19:59,738
different, but you will find out yourself
that they are very different.

221
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:08,643
This looks after our emotional side, and also
beyond this lies the area which is unknown

222
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:11,608
to us, is the subconscious; it is unknown
to us.

223
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:15,688
Whatever is unknown is not God, is not from
God’s area.

224
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:22,438
It is an unknown area, and beyond that subconscious
area, lies the collective subconscious – all

225
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:27,668
that has died from our creation.

226
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:38,519
Recently I was seeing one of the series on
cancer, in London on the television, and they

227
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:44,848
told that they have discovered some sort of
proteins, which they call as protein 58 and

228
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:52,127
56 and all that, they have given names, which
they have also photographed – enter into

229
00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:00,714
our being from areas which are built within
us, from unknown areas – they do not know

230
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:05,394
if they are known areas – which are built
within us since our creation.

231
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:10,088
Now, I’ve told this about ten years back
in America before.

232
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:15,705
And they trigger the happening of cancer,
they trigger it.

233
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:21,536
So it is from the collective subconscious
this attack comes in.

234
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:28,168
So if you move to the left side, you move
to the collective subconscious too much and

235
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:30,978
then all kinds of things can happen to you.

236
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:37,858
For example, first of all you start getting
shaking, you start hearing voices, you start

237
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:43,148
feeling that you are losing your body; you
are going on top of some place and seeing

238
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:44,148
things.

239
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:46,358
Is all these spirits are doing.

240
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:52,788
Now it has reached such a serious state, that
in Switzerland I found that many children

241
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:57,538
were killed because of this action.

242
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:04,148
The mother is, supposing, with some clairvoyant
lady or somebody who is doing this spiritual

243
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:05,148
work.

244
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,148
Is a very dangerous thing.

245
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:08,908
One should never take to this kind of a thing.

246
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:12,767
If you take to these things, then seven generations
suffer.

247
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:17,478
Today only I had a girl who told Me that her
mother was a clairvoyant, and all her life

248
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:22,862
she was miserable with her husband and this
girl has been always crying and weeping and

249
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,978
she cannot conceive or something like that.

250
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:29,478
Is a very serious thing, one should never
go into these unknown areas of the collective

251
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:35,355
subconscious and worry about the dead and
control them and look after them and call

252
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,857
them.

253
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:38,881
You must give them their freedom.

254
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:42,988
Is a very dangerous area into which you enter.

255
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:47,847
I hope you don’t mind it, I have to tell
you the truth, I am your Mother, and I have

256
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:51,668
to tell you the truth: that you should be
very careful about this kind of thing like

257
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:57,188
psychics or the people who try to say that
“You can get possessed.”

258
00:22:57,188 --> 00:23:00,598
They will not say, they say, “It is, it
is–” They can even say, “This is Holy

259
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:01,384
Ghost.”

260
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:02,918
They can say anything.

261
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:08,658
But in whatever way, when you find that you
are not in control of the situation, that

262
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:11,478
means you are not there.

263
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:17,208
Is very simple as that, supposing your car
is driving and suddenly it goes into a khadd

264
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,418
[pit – ED.].

265
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:23,478
Now, do you think that you have achieved a
greater progress by that?

266
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:27,238
It’s just you have moved without your control.

267
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:32,597
If you have no control upon yourself …If
somebody sitting down and he starts jumping

268
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:39,788
– automatically, he cannot control his jumping
– then it is not himself, minimum of minimum.

269
00:23:39,788 --> 00:23:43,088
Whatever he is, even that control is lost.

270
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:50,948
Anything, any such happening which is beyond
your control means that you are enslaved by

271
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:52,712
one of these possessions.

272
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:55,458
But they are never satisfied with what they
do to you.

273
00:23:55,458 --> 00:24:00,378
I mean like I’ll tell you one of the very
startling example of this left side.

274
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:07,238
In London we have – I don’t know now if
they have but we had – a center called,

275
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,968
“Late Dr. Laing’s International Curative
Center.”

276
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:17,328
I didn’t know about it, but a lady came
to Me in India to tell Me about this.

277
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:23,968
She said she had some problem with her stomach
and she wrote to this organization saying

278
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:28,108
that “Please, help me to get cured.”

279
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:32,268
And they wrote back saying that “At five
o’clock on such-and-such date, we’ll enter

280
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,820
into your body.”

281
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:37,798
I mean they were honest, I must say, as English
people are honest sometimes.

282
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:42,198
So he was honest to say that “We’ll enter
into your body, some of the doctors are there

283
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:45,508
who will enter into your body, and they’ll
cure you.”

284
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:51,258
But afterwards, after five years the lady
was rattling, rattling just like a junkie

285
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:52,258
car.

286
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:56,271
And she came to Me and then she gave Me the
history of this, which I verified.

287
00:24:56,296 --> 00:25:03,068
The Dr. Laing, the Dr. Laing, the one, the
one who is the one who is supposed to be running,

288
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,988
is late, he’s dead.

289
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:14,378
He entered into a soldier in Vietnam, an American,
and told him that “You go and talk to my

290
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:19,008
son and tell him that I have entered into
you and that you should start such and such

291
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:20,008
organization.”

292
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:25,868
Now this soldier has never done anything,
I mean he has never seen a scalpel also, he

293
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,218
doesn’t know how to operate, no question.

294
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:34,258
This soldier went to the son and told him,
and he told him certain secrets which convinced

295
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:38,268
the boy and they started that organization.

296
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:42,008
This organization went on like this.

297
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:47,908
And this soldier, of all the persons, used
to do the operation, you see it’s called

298
00:25:47,908 --> 00:25:51,608
“psychic operation,” all sorts of things
and he had never seen anything and he used

299
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:57,438
to be possessed by this man and he did it.

300
00:25:57,438 --> 00:26:00,438
But why didn’t he go to his son directly?

301
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:04,628
Because he knew about the dangers.

302
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:11,398
And the same son will end up – I am sure,
hundred percent, the same gentleman who is

303
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:15,868
operating and the son – with some trouble,
which is of a very serious nature.

304
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:20,905
Because never play with the fire which is
the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

305
00:26:21,218 --> 00:26:23,852
You have to be in the present and not in the
past.

306
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,560
Now the people who think too much about their
past, “What was my previous life?”

307
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:29,810
Why should you worry?

308
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:33,988
Whatever it was is better today because you
can get realization today.

309
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:39,418
You could not get realization even if you
were the King of Egypt, what does it matter?

310
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:44,623
You couldn’t get your realization that day,
so why worry about the past?

311
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:48,298
All the time worrying about the past or playing
with your emotions, you see.

312
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:53,098
Like we had one gentleman, who used to always
cry and weep too much and his mother sent

313
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:57,128
him to Me, and I asked him, “What did you
do all your life?”

314
00:26:57,128 --> 00:27:00,668
He said, “I was very fond of Lord Byron
and I just read him.”

315
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:02,968
I said, “All right, that’s it.”

316
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:08,598
This Lord Byron, he led such a horrible life
himself, an unholy person, and made everybody

317
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:09,598
cry,

318
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:12,108
“You suffer, you must suffer, you must weep.”

319
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,657
Why should you suffer?

320
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:23,023
The idea of a saint is that a person who is
absolutely in bones, walking like a TB patient,

321
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:24,693
is a saint.

322
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,923
I mean is something sadistic, I can’t see
Christ.

323
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:31,873
I was so happy to see that you showed Him
as a resurrection, that is His message.

324
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:34,013
Is resurrection is His message.

325
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:39,465
Crucifixion is just a means but resurrection
is the thing.

326
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:43,256
And the lanky-panky stuff, walking like a
saint, how can that be?

327
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:51,646
Is it possible, a person who is bestowed with
God’s blessing has to be a healthy, cheerful

328
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:54,056
and a very happy person, has to be that.

329
00:27:54,056 --> 00:28:00,226
Minimum of minimum should be that, and I was
happy to see even Mr. Paulsen here, who was

330
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:04,306
very healthy and this thing I said, “Now,
this is a religious place because wherever

331
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:09,327
I go I find such serious and absolutely sickly
people.”

332
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:18,854
So the people who believe in sufferings, like…
the Jews they denied Christ.

333
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:20,244
Why?

334
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:22,636
Because He was a Jew.

335
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:25,593
Is absolutely true about human nature.

336
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:29,266
If I was an American, you would not have accepted
Me.

337
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:36,036
In India the Indian Christians, in whose community
I was born, have not accepted Me at all.

338
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:37,226
Can you imagine?

339
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:43,046
I have got Muslim disciples, Hindus, I’ve
got Parsis and Sikhs, but hardly one or two

340
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:45,096
and maybe My family people.

341
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:47,116
They have not accepted Me.

342
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:51,115
They didn’t accept Christ, and because they
didn’t accept they couldn’t accept that

343
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
He suffered for us.

344
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:54,533
Why should we suffer?

345
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:59,973
Has He suffered less for you any way: has
He left some for you to suffer?

346
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:04,113
So, you want to suffer, all right have Hitler
and suffer?

347
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,410
That’s it!

348
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:08,950
Have him!

349
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:10,057
If you enjoy suffering, why not?

350
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:12,518
And it started like that.

351
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:17,522
Actually when Hitler came, for eleven years,
you will be amazed, eleven years, these people

352
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,402
were supposed to be suffering you among themselves,
you see?

353
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:26,672
In France if you go today people are sitting
outside and they are talking of their sufferings

354
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:29,052
and money and other nonsensical things.

355
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:34,362
They are waiting for the day, they said that
that in ‘82 in any case we are going to

356
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:38,544
be finished, waiting for– they discussing
it very nicely.

357
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:42,593
Les Miserables I call them, as they are.

358
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:47,562
So why should you suffer, I just can’t understand,
when Christ has suffered for you?

359
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:50,642
Only He’s to be awakened within us.

360
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:56,792
If He’s awakened, He takes away all our
sufferings, all our conditionings, all our

361
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:00,948
so-called karmas and everything, which I will
show you later on how it works out.

362
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:03,976
So now we come to the left side then to the
right side.

363
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:11,756
Right side is the action, the power of action,
is the Surya Nadi, is the channel of the sun.

364
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:22,831
When you want to enact your desire, manifest
it, then you use this action power, Iccha

365
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,614
Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

366
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:30,662
Now this power works mainly through this second
center, or we call it the third center, actually

367
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:33,096
it is the third because the second one is
that.

368
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:42,687
This center is called as Swadisthana and this
center has got six, you can see six plexuses,

369
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:44,756
it’s like the Star of David.

370
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:53,365
Moses preached something, and Jews are doing
something else.

371
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:58,376
Christ preached something, and Christians
are doing something else.

372
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:02,766
Adi Shankaracharya taught something, and Hindus
are doing just the opposite.

373
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:06,398
Mohammed taught something, and they did just
the opposite.

374
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:10,883
It’s not only in religion, in every way
you see how we are perverted.

375
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:21,660
Like this center is used for converting the
fat in your stomach for the use of your brain.

376
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:25,036
Nor do we realize that our brain is made of
fat.

377
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,324
Do we know all our nerves are made of fat.

378
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:33,284
Now there’s a general principle in this
country that you should not use any butter,

379
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,176
which is very wrong.

380
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:41,982
When you don’t use any butter how are you
going to supply this brain with something,

381
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:44,136
I mean where will you get, it’s completely
drained out.

382
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:53,190
You use your brain so much, so much so, that
this poor center has to work only for your

383
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,536
thinking which has no productivity.

384
00:31:55,576 --> 00:31:59,908
You just go on thinking, thinking, thinking,
thinking; two horns come out of your head

385
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:04,987
of thinking; still you are thinking, and they
go on growing, you cannot stop your thinking.

386
00:32:05,012 --> 00:32:09,190
And what are you thinking, what have you got
out of your thinking?

387
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:17,987
This right side is the one which is our five
elements also, five elements within us.

388
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:27,384
So when we started discovering what is the
essence of the five elements, in India we

389
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,747
started the Vedas thousands of years back,
and the effect of that is shown now, is the

390
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:35,408
science, you discovered, the science.

391
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:39,422
That you understood how to master these five
elements.

392
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:41,062
But what did you do with it?

393
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:44,062
You created bombs; horrible bombs you have
created.

394
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,002
You have created these devils and now you
are frightened of them.

395
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:49,241
Thank God.

396
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:55,462
That’s something good that all such ventures
stop by themselves because you create a bomb,

397
00:32:55,462 --> 00:32:57,272
it becomes a devil on top of your head.

398
00:32:57,272 --> 00:33:02,082
Now you can’t start war because as soon
as you start means no more existence.

399
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:06,272
So you are frightened and that is how – where
have we gone to?

400
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:10,752
Science has led us to which sensible things,
we should think.

401
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:17,242
For example science has given us all these
devices by which our life can be made very

402
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:18,592
easy.

403
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:23,662
We can have more time, we can have much more
time than our forefathers had, who had to

404
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:29,651
do everything with their own hands and go
about it, but here, you see, everything is

405
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:30,651
instant.

406
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:31,911
I mean anything: You want to have food?

407
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:35,100
All right you have instant, everything is
made instant.

408
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,550
But for what is it instant, is to save time.

409
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:43,622
Now we have watches also here to save time,
everybody’s saving time, saving time, everybody

410
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:44,872
“busy” saving time.

411
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:48,350
But what are you doing about the saved time?

412
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,350
What do we do with it?

413
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:54,041
For example there was a gentleman coming from
India, very busy man, “Very busy, there’s

414
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,242
no time to talk to anyone.”

415
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,880
And I said, “Wanna, why are you in such
a great hurry to go?”

416
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,180
“Oh, you don’t know!

417
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:03,883
I have very important –“

418
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:04,608
“What?”

419
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:07,796
“I have to attend a particular ball for
five hours there.”

420
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:08,821
“Very good.

421
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:10,541
Is that the way you are going to save?”

422
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:15,842
“And then I have to attend a racecourse,
I have to do this, I have to do that.”

423
00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:19,375
This is no saving of time; this is the real
waste of time.

424
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:24,662
Real waste of time is this way we do it, and
how are we going to save our time?

425
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:32,122
Time is to be saved to be realized, to be
in meditation, to enjoy the beauties of God.

426
00:34:32,122 --> 00:34:37,582
That’s why these all things are given to
us, and that’s how we should look at them.

427
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:39,632
But now we have become their slaves.

428
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:46,702
When we achieve something, for example electricity,
it is so important to New York that one day

429
00:34:46,702 --> 00:34:49,418
it stopped, the whole thing stopped.

430
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:51,812
So we become also slaves to these.

431
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:56,172
Apart from that, now we have no time, we are
so busy.

432
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:57,172
I don’t know.

433
00:34:57,172 --> 00:35:00,461
I thought that here people will have more
time than we have in India because, you see,

434
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:06,501
if you have to travel we have very funny trains,
and we have not yet developed as you people

435
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,501
are.

436
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:10,251
Sometimes I have to go to villages in bullock
carts and this and this.

437
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,261
But people have no time.

438
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:17,231
This is the trouble in these countries, you
have no time at all and I don’t know what

439
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,902
constructive work they are doing for themselves.

440
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:22,572
So this is what is the right side where we
go wrong.

441
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:27,551
But the worst thing we do is to think.

442
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:34,051
We think all the time, and what do we think?

443
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:37,072
Either we think of aggression or we think
of recession.

444
00:35:37,072 --> 00:35:41,342
For example we think that, “Oh, we are guilty.”

445
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:47,281
You do something and then you sit down, “Oh,
I should not have done it, this is very wrong

446
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:53,352
I should not have done it,” and you start
wondering about it, correcting about it.

447
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:59,312
But actual correction is not there, actual
correction is not there, only by thinking

448
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,092
you avoid the main issue.

449
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:07,011
You have to be in the present but thinking
can only take you to the left or to the right,

450
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:08,421
to the past or to the present.

451
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:09,421
[future – ED?]

452
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:14,732
You cannot be at the state where you become
just yourself, there’s no thought.

453
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:19,902
There is no mental activity at all, you just
become.

454
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:24,772
Because a thought rises like this and falls
off, another thought rises like that and falls

455
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:28,761
off, in between them is a very little space
which is the present.

456
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:34,622
So the past comes to the future and becomes,
again the future comes in and again becomes

457
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:35,812
the past like that.

458
00:36:35,812 --> 00:36:40,668
But in between is the present and that present
is very small.

459
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:47,162
Unless and until you know how to stay in that
present, you will be always tossing on these

460
00:36:47,162 --> 00:36:53,531
waves of past and future while past is finished
and future doesn’t exist.

461
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:56,142
You plan out something, it – all plans goes
out.

462
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:59,529
You plan anything but how can you plan also,
I can’t understand.

463
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:05,761
Supposing you don’t know the way, and you
plan that, “I will go right and left.”

464
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:09,408
Now supposing you are going to the right and
left is the sea, will you jump in the sea?

465
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:16,801
Anything that you have to do new, you cannot
plan it out, you have to keep it just open,

466
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:22,342
like a seed when it sprouts, it has got a
living cell at its tip.

467
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:26,691
It goes and sees for itself how it has to
move.

468
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:30,466
When there is hardness, it moves round the
hardness, when there is softness, it moves

469
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:31,615
like that.

470
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,741
So when we plan everything we really become
rigid, and like – I heard of a person who

471
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:39,531
planned everything for his picnic.

472
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:45,652
He had all champagne and everything put together
and when he reached the place he had no bottle

473
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:47,362
opener and he had to break the bottles.

474
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:49,092
That’s what it is.

475
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:54,530
Sometimes the planning can be such a headache,
I mean, you waste one hour in planning and

476
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:59,191
while it comes to reality you find it’s
all wrong, it doesn’t work out.

477
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:04,892
So too much planning, like I have to go supposing
to Los Angeles, I have to book My ticket,

478
00:38:04,892 --> 00:38:06,271
this is today, I have to do it today.

479
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:10,632
I don’t have to sit down and plan that on
such and such date I’ll go and book it.

480
00:38:10,632 --> 00:38:14,731
So in the present if you know how to live,
but this cannot be done by saying that “You

481
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:15,731
live in present.”

482
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:20,072
It cannot be done, I know because that’s
not some sort of a thing that can be taught.

483
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:22,597
It has to happen to you, you have to become
that.

484
00:38:22,622 --> 00:38:28,261
Once you become that, then you become thoughtlessly
aware.

485
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:30,462
You become a witness.

486
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:34,237
You see the whole show as a drama, and you
don’t get involved into it.

487
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,771
You just see the waves coming up and going
down.

488
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:43,082
Like, I can say, you are standing in the water,
and there are waves around and you are frightened,

489
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:46,692
but if you are put in the boat you start seeing
those things.

490
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:50,001
If you know how to swim you can enjoy those
waves.

491
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:56,062
In the same way when you become a master,
when you come in the boat in the state of

492
00:38:56,062 --> 00:38:59,572
thoughtless awareness then you start seeing
these things and the whole thing appears like

493
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:00,572
a drama.

494
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:05,342
Actually the whole thing is a drama but the
drama must end for you to see that it’s

495
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:11,261
just a drama and you are unnecessarily worried
about it, and by worry, you know for definite

496
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,531
nothing works out.

497
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:15,952
But if I say, “Don’t worry,” you’ll
worry more, that’s not the way.

498
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:18,261
That’s not the way.

499
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:22,041
They all tried these tricks to say, “Don’t
do that and don’t do that,” it never worked.

500
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,033
With human beings it doesn’t work out.

501
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:27,261
It’s all right with animals, you can work
it out, but with human beings, if you tell

502
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:29,312
them, “Don’t,” they’ll do it ten time.

503
00:39:29,312 --> 00:39:33,072
So best is to so make them that.

504
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:37,322
Unless and until they are made the spirit
it’s impossible to convince a modern man

505
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:38,760
to do something.

506
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:44,781
So is best is first let them have their realization,
let them have their light, let them see for

507
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:48,312
themselves what’s the problem, let them
feel it and correct it.

508
00:39:48,312 --> 00:39:52,592
It’s let them judge themselves, that is
the best way is to do it, and that’s the

509
00:39:52,592 --> 00:40:00,342
time has come for you to have it and see for
yourself and be able to discriminate between

510
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:03,452
false and reality.

511
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:12,671
Now this side beyond is the supraconscious
area, and beyond this is the collective supraconscious.

512
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:22,301
Now if you take LSD, for example you take
LSD, you go onto supraconscious area.

513
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:30,465
I was surprised when I went to Colombia, I
asked them, they had a condor as their emblem

514
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,972
for navy, and I said, “How condor is your
emblem?” because condor has nothing to do

515
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:36,171
with the navy.

516
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:42,678
They said, “Our old Indians have told us
that a God called Shri Vishnu,” just see

517
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:45,476
the name, “came on a condor.”

518
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:48,082
And really condor is the conveyance of Vishnu.

519
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:49,761
Can you imagine?

520
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:51,911
I was amazed at this.

521
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:56,171
How did these people in thousands of years
backs saw, but then I said, “What were they

522
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,622
doing normally, what was their pastime?”

523
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:08,461
And they showed Me a thing made out of a shell
of a fruit and with a little stirring rod

524
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:09,971
in it.

525
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:10,981
I said, “What is this?”

526
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:12,742
They said, “They used to make some sort
of a amrose.”

527
00:41:12,742 --> 00:41:14,511
“Oh, I see, that’s it.”

528
00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:20,051
And even today Peru is exporting that amrose
to you which is nothing but LSD.

529
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:25,942
If you take things like that, of that nature,
of LSD nature, you go to the right side.

530
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,511
You move to your supraconscious area.

531
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:30,582
Means you get disintegrated.

532
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:35,281
In the morning I told you that when you are
integrated you don’t see any auras or anything

533
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:36,281
around the person.

534
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:40,092
When you are disintegrated, only then you
see because you become these five elements.

535
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:43,632
When you are integrated you don’t see anything.

536
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:49,541
And then you start seeing these things, like
an eye and a light, and all those things you

537
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:56,011
start seeing, and if you go further, further
with it into supraconscious areas, you can

538
00:41:56,011 --> 00:42:01,541
become horribly possessed by the people who
have been ambitious.

539
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,991
Even Hitler can possess you.

540
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:05,461
Hitler did that.

541
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:08,892
Hitler did all supraconscious activity in
Germany.

542
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:12,382
How he possessed people was through supraconscious.

543
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:17,382
Because in the supraconscious, collective
supraconscious, there are many ambitious people

544
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:18,521
who have died.

545
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:24,392
Like Gauguin was an ambitious man, but he
became mad, I don’t know how he became mad.

546
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:28,911
Normally an ambitious man doesn’t become
mad he makes everyone mad, but he doesn’t

547
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:29,911
become himself.

548
00:42:29,911 --> 00:42:34,671
But this fellow was possessed, and we saw
it in the television that a man who was possessed

549
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:36,943
by this Gauguin was painting just like him.

550
00:42:36,943 --> 00:42:40,582
I know – you see Gauguin’s paintings,
that you must be knowing also that in one

551
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:44,652
line he puts lots of color and he was doing
it very fast.

552
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:46,961
And he said, “I’m possessed by Gauguin.”

553
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:51,812
So these ambitious people, like some of the
ambitious people could be doctors, could be

554
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:59,961
mathematicians, can be physicians or anything
like that, they can possess.

555
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:06,912
I know of a lady, she is a unique mathematician
and she’s possessed, definitely possessed.

556
00:43:06,912 --> 00:43:10,853
And she can tell you anything you ask her,
any square root, anything she can tell you,

557
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:14,943
and she’s earning lot of money out of it
but she’s always sick, she has a headache.

558
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:18,175
She came to Me for curing, I said, “You
have to give up this nonsense.”

559
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:21,008
She said, “Let me make sufficient money,
then I’ll give up.”

560
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:25,905
I said, “By that time I may not be there.”

561
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,372
So these things can happen to you with the
supraconscious activity and this awareness

562
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:33,852
of supraconscious is also very dangerous.

563
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:39,671
The trouble is if you suffer from the superego
there, from this side, with the conditionings,

564
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:41,501
you suffer.

565
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:46,501
I mean you get the pains all over the body,
you might feel sick, you will cry and weep,

566
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:49,642
you’ll be unhappy, it troubles you.

567
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:54,702
But when you are possessed by this ego business,
as it is ego is too much, and then if you

568
00:43:54,702 --> 00:44:01,232
get possessed by somebody egoistical, then
God save that person and God save all the

569
00:44:01,232 --> 00:44:05,792
relations, because such a person you cannot
even talk, he’s so aggressive, he’s so

570
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:14,132
aggressive, he will aggress all the other
people ultimately he himself becomes absolutely

571
00:44:14,132 --> 00:44:16,066
stupid fool.

572
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:21,961
Many people whom we think are very successful
in life, really are stupid; if you look at

573
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:23,766
them they are really stupid people.

574
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:30,267
Like we can say, this Kennedy’s… a man,
what was his name is, whom she married –

575
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,267
Man: Onasis

576
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:34,372
Shri Mataji: He was a stupid fool, I have
met him.

577
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:37,862
I met him; he was a real fool I tell you.

578
00:44:37,862 --> 00:44:41,842
I don’t know how this woman married him
and she must be another stupid fool to marry

579
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:42,842
him.

580
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:43,842
Both must be foolish.

581
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:47,991
Actually I met him very well, because My husband
is with the shipping, and I don’t know how

582
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:52,214
could she marry this old man like her grandfather
and what was the thing?

583
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:57,572
Maybe money part or whatever it was, I mean
it’s so stupid, the whole thing is so stupid.

584
00:44:57,572 --> 00:45:01,832
And this stupidity you can see, even it grows
with your age more and more, and you become

585
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,062
more stupid.

586
00:45:04,062 --> 00:45:08,112
Like an eighty-year-old woman writing love
letters to an eighteen-year-old boy.

587
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:09,112
It’s stupidity.

588
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:13,922
Is absolute stupidity, I tell you, if you
see it from wisdom point of view.

589
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:18,832
One can’t understand an old man, who is
like a great-grandfather, writing a love letter

590
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:24,112
to a little girl of eighteen years or an old
woman, who could be a great-great-great-grandmother

591
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:27,156
writing to a little boy like that, it’s
absurd.

592
00:45:28,384 --> 00:45:33,577
And they are so stupid and they talk like
this, “I believe in this.”

593
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:37,944
Of course all the donkeys believe like that,
so there’s nothing new about it.

594
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:41,823
But they are so starringly stupid that you
are amazed, you know.

595
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:44,988
You start looking at them, “What’s the
matter with them?”

596
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:50,112
This is the blessing of this mister ego, which
exists in the head sometimes goes up like

597
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:57,863
a balloon, but you start seeing it, you start
seeing it when you get your realization.

598
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:06,962
I had a disciple, one of My sons, who came
to Me and one day he said, “Mother, I’m

599
00:46:06,987 --> 00:46:08,311
really frightened with one idea.”

600
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:09,322
I Said, “What is it?”

601
00:46:09,322 --> 00:46:11,096
“But You don’t tell me if it is true.”

602
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:12,080
I said, “What is it?”

603
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,146
He said, “Was I Napoleon in my last life?”

604
00:46:15,193 --> 00:46:17,233
I said, “What makes you think like that?”

605
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:21,672
“Because I can see such a big ego on my
head, this could be only Napoleon and I know

606
00:46:21,672 --> 00:46:22,672
how to draw.

607
00:46:22,672 --> 00:46:27,132
These two things put together, could I have
been Napoleon, but if I was You don’t tell

608
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:30,693
me otherwise I may commit suicide” – even
after realization.

609
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:34,652
So it is ego becomes then a headache to us.

610
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:38,473
It becomes a headache and we want to get rid
of it.

611
00:46:38,473 --> 00:46:44,592
We start seeing it, and it presses you, you
get a headache and you feel it in the Agnya,

612
00:46:44,592 --> 00:46:47,033
how it troubles you.

613
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:50,803
Then it starts troubling you – not others
so much as it troubles you – because you

614
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:53,652
don’t want to accept that you are egoistical,
you start seeing it.

615
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:57,852
But you don’t say that you have a ego, you
will come and tell Me, “Mother I’ve got

616
00:46:57,852 --> 00:47:00,283
an Agnya catching,” and we have to clear
that Agnya.

617
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:03,453
Nobody feels bad about it because you are
separated from yourself.

618
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:09,092
You don’t feel that you are hurt or insulted
because you get separated, and you see for

619
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,092
yourself.

620
00:47:10,092 --> 00:47:14,724
Like this sari has some sort of a black spot
on it, so I see it, I take it out, and then

621
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:18,303
I want to wash it, I don’t want to keep
it black; I am not identified with it.

622
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:23,703
So all these fixations also drop out when
you get realized, because you go in the center,

623
00:47:23,703 --> 00:47:25,473
not on the left or to the right.

624
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:36,003
Now movement on the right, actually is the
blessing of this center, in the center, because

625
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:43,382
the central line is this line of our evolution,
is the line of sustenance, is the line by

626
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:45,753
which we have become human beings.

627
00:47:45,753 --> 00:47:53,553
First of all we get our sustenance, like we
can say the gold is untarnishable.

628
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:55,539
That is the sustenance of gold.

629
00:47:55,564 --> 00:48:02,182
We can say carbon has four valences, in the
same way human beings have ten valences – they

630
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:04,612
are in the stomach.

631
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:10,402
These are the ten sustenance described as
the Ten Commandments in the Bible.

632
00:48:10,402 --> 00:48:14,092
They all can be explained very well in Sahaj
Yoga.

633
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:21,892
This is the human sustenance which is around
in that part which we call as Void.

634
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:28,763
It’s not the same Void, or is the gap, as
the Zen, but this is the Void, we mean the

635
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:34,993
space where we exist in our evolutionary state.

636
00:48:34,993 --> 00:48:42,132
Now this center is the one that is presided
over – this one, the second one is presided

637
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:47,672
over by the Creator, and this one is through
the Preserver, the one who preserves.

638
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:53,453
Now there can be a problem with people who
believe that there is one God.

639
00:48:53,453 --> 00:48:54,912
I also believe the same thing.

640
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:59,699
I mean, it is true: He – there’s only
one God, but He has different aspects.

641
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:03,870
God doesn’t exist like, say, Rock of Gibraltar.

642
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:08,165
Even Rock of Gibraltar, if you see, it has
got aspects.

643
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:15,175
God has aspects like a gentleman, now say
for example if a gentleman is a minister here,

644
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:18,944
he could be a husband, he could be a father,
he could be a brother, he could be anything.

645
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:26,236
So God has different aspects and out of that
the first aspect, as I told you of the existence,

646
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:34,266
the power of existence, that does not incarnate
on this earth, it does not incarnate, it just

647
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:39,655
exist, it watches, it sees, and that is in
the heart, which is the Spirit – expression

648
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:45,326
of that God Almighty who is watching the spectacle
of His Power.

649
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:51,201
Now the other aspect of God is that He’s
a Creator, He creates all these galaxies and

650
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:59,661
all these things now as I told you yesterday
about the Vishuddhi Chakra, we are this center

651
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:08,000
which is America, that if this center is awakened
here, you don’t have to have any missiles

652
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,901
or anything.

653
00:50:09,901 --> 00:50:16,790
As in the Saturn, you have got a girdle around,
you too have that girdle around America and

654
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,901
nobody can touch you, but you are to be awakened
first of all.

655
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:24,570
If you are awakened in that center, nobody
can touch you.

656
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:32,610
Russia is going to know about it, they have
to know about it because they are getting

657
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:36,550
into parapsychology and all these things and
they are going to get possessed about this.

658
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:41,280
They have to know through their supraconscious
that you are the people who are awakened.

659
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,610
Once you are awakened nobody can touch you,
because there’s a girdle round you, and

660
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:52,280
there are sixteen sub-plexuses as there are
sixteen, you have seen there are sixteen substar

661
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,011
– sub, what do you call them?

662
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:55,011
Warren: Moons

663
00:50:55,011 --> 00:51:01,451
Shri Mataji: Moons, they call them moons,
sixteen moons around Saturn.

664
00:51:01,451 --> 00:51:04,251
And you are one guided by Saturn.

665
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,651
Saturn makes this country.

666
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:11,461
Saturn has made this country, and this is
the Vishuddhi Chakra which is a very important

667
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:13,530
chakra about which I’ll tell later.

668
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:17,480
So this center we come to of our evolution.

669
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:24,220
Is presided by the Preserver, the aspect of
preservation, He’s the Father who looks

670
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:29,370
after us; He’s the One who gives us our
wellbeing.

671
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:32,801
He comes on this earth again and again in
different forms.

672
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:42,230
According to Indian Puranas, the Ark of Noah
was saved by a fish, which was a dolphin,

673
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,401
and this dolphin fish was this aspect which
incarnated.

674
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:54,290
Then the second aspect came as the tortoise,
then the third as a quadiped.

675
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:59,820
Like that they have described the evolution,
how these incarnations had to come to break

676
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:06,561
the barriers of the evolutionary ignorance.

677
00:52:06,632 --> 00:52:09,725
These are the people who came for the break-through.

678
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:17,300
Ultimately a short man was created called
as Vamana, then a very fiery, big man, he’s

679
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,357
called as Passidon, [Poseidon – ED] in Greek
language.

680
00:52:21,382 --> 00:52:26,360
Greeks made their gods look like human beings;
I mean they never kept their purity.

681
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,211
See, everybody was given with some quality
of a human being.

682
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:33,941
I don’t know why they did it but that’s
how they spoiled the whole game.

683
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:42,000
Now this god, the god, which we can say or
the incarnation that came on this earth was

684
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:51,790
a fiery man, a man who fought the nature,
who fought all the different elements.

685
00:52:51,790 --> 00:53:01,941
And then after that came another aspect on
this earth, who was Shri Rama, is the ideal

686
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:10,391
king, the king who is a benevolent king, the
One who gave us the political idea about how

687
00:53:10,391 --> 00:53:13,961
to govern – Shri Rama – this was eight
thousand years back.

688
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:21,191
Then came the incarnation, after that the
incarnation came in the center here, before,

689
00:53:21,191 --> 00:53:26,300
before Rama, this incarnation was of the Goddess,
of the primordial Mother.

690
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:33,661
She Herself incarnated on this earth before
Rama, because many forces which were negative

691
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:39,661
were collected by the ignorance of human beings,
and the seekers were very much harmed.

692
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:47,951
So She came on this earth to kill those horrible,
demonic forces and to destroy them and to

693
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:54,651
save the seekers, Her children, to save them
from this drowning into the sea of illusion,

694
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:56,421
and She came on this earth.

695
00:53:56,421 --> 00:54:02,730
As they say she came thousand times, but actually
She came many-a-times before Shri Rama came

696
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,730
in.

697
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:08,391
Then came Shri Rama who came on the right-hand
side of the heart.

698
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:11,240
Now this is also a very important center within
us.

699
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,330
Those people who have problems with the fatherhood.

700
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:19,531
Like today there was a girl who was catching
on the right hand, this heart, this is the

701
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:20,531
center.

702
00:54:20,531 --> 00:54:26,461
We asked her what about her father, and she
told Me, “My father is dead but he’s still

703
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:27,730
guiding me.”

704
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,241
I said, “That’s not good, you must give
relief to your father.

705
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:34,750
He should be given freedom, and you will feel
better.”

706
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,951
And people with this heart get asthma.

707
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:43,260
This side, this problem, on this finger we
feel, get asthma, problems with their breathing…

708
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:49,951
All these things can be cured if you just
tell them that, “You ask your father to

709
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:53,481
leave you and to be born again and forget
about it.”

710
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:55,620
It works wonders, we have seen.

711
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:07,901
But recently a doctor in England has performed
some experiments with, what you call, anorexia

712
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:11,431
– there’s a disease anorexia, where the
girls just don’t eat any food.

713
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:16,090
He found out that these girls, when they were
told about their father, and that a rite can

714
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:22,070
be, I mean the after death rites can be done
and all that, they felt all right and they

715
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,491
got rid of it.

716
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:27,901
Can you imagine this is experimented and found
out now; I mean this we have been doing for

717
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:32,340
the last ten years, but recently it has been
found out that if a girl is suffering from

718
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:38,480
this disease of anorexia, you can cure it;
if the father is dead, then only it happens.

719
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:46,360
So fatherhood –a man who is not a good father,
a man who has a bad father, a girl who is

720
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:54,271
too much attached to the father or a girl
who is not treated nicely also by her husband

721
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:58,651
– also the husband is there – if he doesn’t
look after her well, she can suffer.

722
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:03,120
Now the center part, this one – the one
he’s there [Warren is showing on the Virata

723
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,681
Chakra chart] – center heart, it’s also
a very, very important center where the Goddess

724
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:15,441
– the world, we say the Mother of the World,
Jagadamba She’s called – has incarnated.

725
00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:23,090
Is a very important thing for us, because
when you suffer, say, from any insecurities,

726
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:31,161
then this center starts going into palpitations,
this center starts vibrating very much.

727
00:56:31,161 --> 00:56:37,020
Till the boy is of twelve years or a girl
is of twelve years, in the sternum bone the

728
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,401
antibodies are created by this center.

729
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:46,141
This center creates the antibodies and they
circulate in the whole body and remain there,

730
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:52,480
and whenever there is an attack, either from
a entity or from any disease or anything,

731
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,260
these antibodies fight it.

732
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:58,641
And that is the center which is very important,
specially for women.

733
00:56:58,641 --> 00:57:04,250
If their motherhood is challenged or if they
are insecure, if their husbands are making

734
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:10,491
them insecure by any of their behavior, then
they develop this trouble of this center,

735
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:13,691
where they may get breast cancer.

736
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,730
Breast cancer comes to women when they are
insecure.

737
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:25,260
Only it can be cured when this center is awakened;
breast cancer can be very easily cured, if

738
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:31,671
they could be secured through awakening of
this center of the Mother of the Universe.

739
00:57:31,671 --> 00:57:37,641
And then we have the center up there, which
is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which is a very important…

740
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:50,270
for you, because it is adorned by the completion
of this evolution as called as Virat – it

741
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:57,580
is Shri Krishna, who is the complete incarnation
of this primordial being.

742
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,441
And He is placed there.

743
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:09,935
It is He who is the witness, who is watching.

744
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,401
When the Kundalini rises over this, you start
witnessing the whole thing.

745
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:20,750
It has got sixteen sub plexuses and which
look after your face, your nose, eyes, ears

746
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,760
and all these places.

747
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:29,131
And when this center is out, then you have
all kinds of problems.

748
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:36,300
Say the left side, left side Vishuddhi Chakra
catches when you feel guilty, when you are

749
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,300
diffident.

750
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,901
When you start thinking that, “It is very
wrong too, I should have not done this,”

751
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:43,191
and all that, then the left Vishuddhi catches.

752
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:48,441
Or also with smoking it catches; smoking spoils
this center very much.

753
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:53,451
Imagine in America the percentage of smokers
is the maximum.

754
00:58:53,451 --> 00:58:59,370
Can you imagine, in this center only where
they are born, this is the maximum here?

755
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:04,394
Like England is the heart of the universe,
where they are lethargic.

756
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:09,881
Europe is the liver of the world where they
are drinking.

757
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:14,830
America is the Vishuddhi of the world where
they are smoking.

758
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:18,877
What a justice done to themselves and to God,
their Creator!

759
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,816
So smoking is against this center.

760
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:26,551
Thank God now it is established that it causes
cancer, but still people are smoking, they

761
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:28,364
say, “What does it matter?”

762
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:33,338
But this is a very, very important center
for us because this is the time when we raised

763
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:35,259
our head, this center came up.

764
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:40,394
Now see the ego and superego start developing
actually from here.

765
00:59:40,707 --> 00:59:45,156
So this gives rise to ego and superego.

766
00:59:45,156 --> 00:59:49,467
Somebody is a very arrogant person, catches
on the right; who is a very aggressive type

767
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:51,467
he catches on the right Vishuddhi.

768
00:59:51,467 --> 01:00:04,136
In the center, a person who is against God,
who is anti-God, who is against collectivity,

769
01:00:04,136 --> 01:00:10,967
who is talking against God, who is openly
saying things against God, catches on this

770
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:12,997
center.

771
01:00:12,997 --> 01:00:19,576
So this center, as it is, is very important
for you, because if you can awaken this center

772
01:00:19,576 --> 01:00:24,396
within you here, as I’ve told you, you become
as powerful as Shri Krishna.

773
01:00:24,396 --> 01:00:27,126
Shri Krishna has a Samhara Shakti.

774
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:34,937
He has the power to kill; He has four special
things with Him, four weapons by which He

775
01:00:34,937 --> 01:00:41,586
kills, but one of them is this, in His hand,
is a discus and this discus is shown around

776
01:00:41,586 --> 01:00:44,318
the Saturn which you see.

777
01:00:44,343 --> 01:00:49,506
And with this discus at any distance He can
destroy.

778
01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:52,549
So His destructive powers are built in you.

779
01:00:52,574 --> 01:00:54,815
Nobody can destroy you.

780
01:00:56,479 --> 01:01:01,116
You have to just get to your Self and become
your Self.

781
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:07,806
You’ll become so powerful a nation – but
powerful in loving, in being compassionate

782
01:01:07,806 --> 01:01:14,987
and affectionate, in the real sense of the
word, not the way we are now trying to help

783
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:16,666
others; is not the way.

784
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:21,707
It can be very disgraceful sometimes; the
way we try to help others can be very disgraceful.

785
01:01:21,707 --> 01:01:27,327
You will be amazed how, sometimes you people
have helped and have created problem for others.

786
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:33,737
I’ll give a very simple example which is
really surprising and astonishing.

787
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:40,197
Some years back we had a dearth of wheat,
and people sent horrible wheat to India, horrible,

788
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,697
that even the animals would not eat.

789
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:44,336
Just to help us, you see.

790
01:01:44,336 --> 01:01:47,497
We are not so badly off people; we are very
fussy about food.

791
01:01:47,497 --> 01:01:52,156
We may be poor but we don’t eat everything;
we are very fussy.

792
01:01:52,156 --> 01:01:55,806
So people threw away that wheat outside.

793
01:01:55,806 --> 01:02:01,727
That wheat grew into a grass, which was called
as “Congress Grass,” can you imagine,

794
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:09,707
and that grass started moving from the roads
to the fields, from the fields to all the

795
01:02:09,707 --> 01:02:11,747
trees and started engulfing them.

796
01:02:11,747 --> 01:02:20,666
It was like a mad grass, it was like a malignant
grass, eating away everything that there was.

797
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:23,960
Imagine, as it is we had dearth of thing and
this thing came, and we didn’t know what

798
01:02:23,985 --> 01:02:25,403
to do with it.

799
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:31,249
So we tried some Sahaj Yoga tricks and it
has worked, and thank God that grass is now

800
01:02:31,274 --> 01:02:32,249
finished.

801
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:39,228
But from that grass you had sent some other
seeds of acacia, and these also people threw

802
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:40,253
away.

803
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:46,886
Out of this came out such horrible trees of
acacia that it has got thorns which are poisonous.

804
01:02:46,886 --> 01:02:50,866
And in the villages they have grown so big
that children can’t play and if they touch

805
01:02:50,866 --> 01:02:53,450
that they get very seriously ill.

806
01:02:53,475 --> 01:02:56,896
It’s a very seri– which you have done
so innocently.

807
01:02:56,896 --> 01:03:03,543
There’s no grace about it, I think, the
way it was done, and that’s how we can create

808
01:03:03,568 --> 01:03:07,255
problem through our help to others because
what is there to help.

809
01:03:07,544 --> 01:03:09,691
Who is the other?

810
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:14,149
If you are the collectivity, if you are Shri
Krishna, then what are you helping?

811
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:17,229
You are helping yourself, this is your own
finger.

812
01:03:17,254 --> 01:03:21,454
If you help your own finger, you don’t help
it in a different way than you help other

813
01:03:21,454 --> 01:03:24,964
fingers.

814
01:03:24,964 --> 01:03:28,819
That means you become collective being, and
you are.

815
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:34,083
People like Abraham Lincoln, as I said yesterday,
and great people in this country established

816
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:36,431
these great ideals of liberty.

817
01:03:36,734 --> 01:03:48,189
And the liberty, they said that, even Roosevelt
once said that “Poverty anywhere is a threat

818
01:03:48,214 --> 01:03:49,888
to prosperity anywhere.”

819
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:55,863
What at great thing to say, to feel that,
that oneness with others, that anywhere poverty

820
01:03:55,863 --> 01:03:59,363
is a threat to our prosperity!

821
01:03:59,363 --> 01:04:04,714
All this collectivity has been expressed by
your great men in this country, not only but

822
01:04:04,714 --> 01:04:13,194
the sense of responsibility because it is
on your shoulders, the responsibility.

823
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:21,283
Responsibility of making others the Self,
realize, is your responsibility.

824
01:04:21,283 --> 01:04:26,066
You are the responsible nation, you are responsible
for the whole universe, whatever things you

825
01:04:26,091 --> 01:04:28,623
do here that goes outside.

826
01:04:28,623 --> 01:04:33,163
You took to rock ’n roll, people started
doing rock ’n roll, you did anything nonsensical

827
01:04:33,163 --> 01:04:34,763
that started going abroad.

828
01:04:34,763 --> 01:04:38,346
Anything nonsensical you do here spreads everywhere
because Americans are doing.

829
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:40,901
Jeans, now everybody wears, even in India!

830
01:04:40,901 --> 01:04:49,220
Imagine in that hot country they are wearing
very strong, starched ones, and they get all

831
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:53,668
kinds of problems with that, circulation problems
[INDISTINCT: I mean?], but…

832
01:04:53,693 --> 01:04:56,113
“Americans are doing,” everybody is becoming
American in India.

833
01:04:56,147 --> 01:05:01,003
That’s it, in every developing country you
have put your hand; you have interest in everyone,

834
01:05:01,003 --> 01:05:08,882
but should be done after realization when
you feel the pangs of others, you feel the

835
01:05:08,882 --> 01:05:16,802
heart, you feel the real pain of others within
yourself, and you do it, not because you want

836
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:19,702
to do it for others, but do it because you
want to save yourself out of that pain.

837
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:22,176
You do it for yourself.

838
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:27,259
If somebody’s drowned and you try to save
a person who is drowned, then you don’t

839
01:05:27,284 --> 01:05:30,877
save him you actually are saving yourself
because something in you is getting drowned

840
01:05:30,902 --> 01:05:32,379
there.

841
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:36,615
And that happens to you when you become that
collective being, when you become the Spirit,

842
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:38,595
then it happens to you.

843
01:05:38,595 --> 01:05:44,496
Before that, whatever you do is disgraceful,
sometimes can be harmful, can be very ugly

844
01:05:44,521 --> 01:05:48,855
and sometimes it can be so grotesque that
people say, “All right, you keep your help

845
01:05:48,855 --> 01:05:50,355
to yourself, we don’t want to have any more
of this.”

846
01:05:50,355 --> 01:05:57,125
I mean you take away all the self-respect
of people.

847
01:05:57,125 --> 01:06:05,835
So one has to understand that you stand here
in this world, in this universe as a collective

848
01:06:05,835 --> 01:06:10,426
being, as the representative of that collective
being at this Vishuddhi Chakra and you have

849
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:12,406
to give with your hands.

850
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:15,006
For giving.

851
01:06:15,006 --> 01:06:20,736
This applies to your hands and you must give,
those hands which have never given are no

852
01:06:20,736 --> 01:06:26,416
good, they are very insensitive hands, you
must give, and that must come into you, and

853
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:33,936
not giving for giving’s sake, but Nirvach,,
as they say, without any, any return about

854
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:34,936
it.

855
01:06:34,936 --> 01:06:38,805
Nothing, is just giving, just flowing, just
like the Sun’s rays are coming to you, they

856
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:41,765
don’t want anything in return, do they?

857
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:42,765
Just flowing.

858
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:52,216
When that should happen, if Sahaj Yoga takes
to it, I hope it takes to America that Americans

859
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:55,145
accept Sahaj Yog, that it works out.

860
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,726
You have already got all kinds of horrible
people here.

861
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:04,166
I don’t know how you are going to work it
out, but God willing, with your determination,

862
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:06,245
I am sure.

863
01:07:06,245 --> 01:07:12,666
This is the first Unity Church I’m visiting
and I hope that in other Unity Churches also,

864
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:18,865
it will be made convenient for Me and we can
save other people also, and they can become

865
01:07:18,865 --> 01:07:30,785
realized souls and they can become the Vishuddhi
Chakras, the responsible people, men of God,

866
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:35,285
those who have to become prophets, that they
are responsible that they have to make others

867
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:44,906
also prophets and save so many seekers who
are gathered in this great country of yours

868
01:07:44,906 --> 01:07:51,436
because they know here it will happen, and
that they should be enabled to enter into

869
01:07:51,436 --> 01:07:54,876
the Kingdom of God because the time has come
for that.

870
01:07:54,876 --> 01:08:01,845
So we come up to Vishuddhi Chakra, and the
last center, chakra, here is the center of

871
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:02,845
Christ.

872
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:06,166
[ASIDE: Should I go?

873
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:13,086
If I do it tomorrow, would be better.

874
01:08:13,086 --> 01:08:14,825
All right?]

875
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:19,456
Tomorrow about Christ I’ll tell you because
I want to take one hour explaining Him very

876
01:08:19,456 --> 01:08:20,456
well.

877
01:08:20,456 --> 01:08:29,406
I was very much impressed by your whole idea
about Christ, the unity, the integration and

878
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:34,696
your symbols are very correct, everything
is just there, somebody has to just trigger

879
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:39,575
it, and it will work out.

880
01:08:39,575 --> 01:08:46,965
First you must get your realization, grow
into it, develop your discrimination, you

881
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:51,485
become your own guru, and then everything
that you are doing in this Unity Church will

882
01:08:51,486 --> 01:08:58,715
have a great meaning, you can prove it, you
can prove it that there is God, there is Christ,

883
01:08:58,715 --> 01:09:00,445
there are all these incarnations.

884
01:09:00,446 --> 01:09:04,179
Christ Himself has said that “Those who
are not against Me are with Me.”

885
01:09:04,204 --> 01:09:07,200
These are the people.

886
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:15,226
And I’m sure one day it will happen that
Unity Church will show its own worth, its

887
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:21,463
own explanation of its existence, why it came
into existence.

888
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:26,728
Thank you very much.

889
01:09:28,256 --> 01:09:33,486
May God bless you.

890
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:44,946
If you have any questions you may ask, and
then we’ll have the session for realization.

891
01:09:44,946 --> 01:10:02,046
Seeker: Sometimes in meditation and in chanting,
a person will be rocking.

892
01:10:04,588 --> 01:10:09,123
Would you consider that a negative thing?

893
01:10:09,148 --> 01:10:13,768
Warren: Sometimes in meditation people will
rock or move.

894
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,143
Is this a negative thing?

895
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:18,508
Shri Mataji: Absolutely, absolutely.

896
01:10:18,508 --> 01:10:22,998
You should not rock, there should be no movement,
the eyes should be steady, there should be

897
01:10:22,998 --> 01:10:25,228
no movement in the eyelids, nothing.

898
01:10:25,228 --> 01:10:27,468
This rocking is absolutely wrong.

899
01:10:27,468 --> 01:10:31,891
All these things should not happen to you,
that’s not meditation.

900
01:10:31,954 --> 01:10:38,854
Meditation is where you are absolutely normal,
you are always in meditation after realization,

901
01:10:38,854 --> 01:10:40,994
you are in meditation.

902
01:10:40,994 --> 01:10:47,624
Question: I’ve studied with Paramahansa
Yogananda the SRF, Self-Realization Fellowship,

903
01:10:47,624 --> 01:10:56,384
and one of the things they teach is to focus
the eyes, with the eyes closed only on the

904
01:10:56,384 --> 01:10:57,384
[INAUDIBLE].

905
01:10:57,384 --> 01:11:01,214
Shri Mataji: I must say that I don’t want
to start any controversy.

906
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:09,314
That’s one thing sure, but I’ll tell you
that proof of the pudding is in the eating.

907
01:11:09,314 --> 01:11:12,244
Let’s go this way.

908
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:16,784
First of all logically we should see, we have
to get baptism through here, not through here.

909
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:19,147
Do we get baptism through here?

910
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:26,304
If the door is here what’s the use of breaking
this window?

911
01:11:26,304 --> 01:11:33,164
And focusing and effort is not going to give
you realization, is wrong.

912
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:38,194
You see this pampers– human effort, you
see it pampers you that you can put in an

913
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:39,194
effort.

914
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,194
You cannot.

915
01:11:40,194 --> 01:11:43,814
One must accept this position: we cannot put
in an effort for a living thing.

916
01:11:43,814 --> 01:11:49,474
For example, as I told you, for a seed if
you have to sprout it you have to put it in

917
01:11:49,474 --> 01:11:50,474
the Mother Earth.

918
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,264
You cannot pull it out, isn’t it?

919
01:11:52,264 --> 01:11:56,164
Whatever you may try, you cannot pull it out
and sprout.

920
01:11:56,164 --> 01:11:58,744
You cannot put in any effort.

921
01:11:58,744 --> 01:12:06,094
Any effort is wrong, is against spontaneity
and living things.

922
01:12:06,094 --> 01:12:09,421
So no effort is needed as such.

923
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:16,764
Lady: I’d like to ask Her about that center
where the immune bodies develop, at what age

924
01:12:16,764 --> 01:12:30,444
and what can we do in order to make that immunity
get bigger or…

925
01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:32,344
Warren: She says two questions.

926
01:12:32,344 --> 01:12:40,874
At what age does the immune bodies start developing
and secondly is there any way in which you

927
01:12:40,874 --> 01:12:43,424
can expand the capacity of the immune bodies?

928
01:12:43,424 --> 01:12:45,514
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course.

929
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:47,984
Of course, that is what Sahaj Yoga is.

930
01:12:47,984 --> 01:12:53,044
When you become the truth, all untruth falls
off, is that is what Sahaj Yoga is; absolutely

931
01:12:53,044 --> 01:12:54,054
that is what it is.

932
01:12:54,054 --> 01:12:58,616
Tomorrow, I am going to tell you about Christ
and about cancer; about all these immune bodies

933
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:00,105
how we fight them.

934
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,614
That may be day after tomorrow, I don’t
know, but tomorrow, may not be, but day after

935
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:05,584
tomorrow I’ll tell you how to grow into
it.

936
01:13:05,584 --> 01:13:06,584
Absolutely.

937
01:13:06,584 --> 01:13:10,744
You learn how to protect, you learn how to
fight.

938
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:11,914
Absolutely.

939
01:13:11,914 --> 01:13:19,604
That is what happens after realization then
you must learn the divine technique, not before

940
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:20,604
realization.

941
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:23,124
After realization, not before.

942
01:13:23,124 --> 01:13:27,144
Before it is connected what’s the use of
playing with it?

943
01:13:27,144 --> 01:13:29,684
It has to be connected first.

944
01:13:29,684 --> 01:13:32,804
What is it?

945
01:13:40,387 --> 01:13:42,379
Warren: Any other questions?

946
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:47,494
Man: What are the avenues available to keep
these channels open?

947
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:51,534
Warren: What are the avenues available to
keep the channels open?

948
01:13:51,534 --> 01:13:53,624
Shri Mataji: To be your Spirit.

949
01:13:53,624 --> 01:14:01,824
And we will let you know later on how to work
it out, how to balance yourself, how the imbalances

950
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:02,824
are there.

951
01:14:02,824 --> 01:14:05,044
This I’ll do it on Wednesday.

952
01:14:05,044 --> 01:14:11,404
I will tell you how to keep them clear, how
to keep your chakras clear, how to work it

953
01:14:11,404 --> 01:14:13,694
out, everything I’ll tell you.

954
01:14:13,694 --> 01:14:14,694
And also –

955
01:14:14,694 --> 01:14:19,284
[We don’t have a book about it, isn’t
it, but in any case –

956
01:14:19,284 --> 01:14:20,284
Warren: We’ve got the “Advent.”

957
01:14:20,284 --> 01:14:21,284
Shri Mataji: Oh yes.

958
01:14:21,284 --> 01:14:22,284
]

959
01:14:22,284 --> 01:14:27,044
We have a very big book on this Sahaj Yoga,
which of course we do not sell to everyone,

960
01:14:27,044 --> 01:14:30,214
but we’ll see about it.

961
01:14:30,214 --> 01:14:34,474
We’ll see about it because you people are
growing very fast.

962
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:40,485
If you people really grow, then we’ll sell
it to you also, but normally we don’t sell

963
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:41,790
it to everyone.

964
01:14:43,157 --> 01:14:45,645
Question: Do you feel Hatha Yoga is necessary?

965
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:48,426
Shri Mataji: Not at all, nothing.

966
01:14:48,451 --> 01:14:51,822
On the contrary Hatha Yoga creates a problem,
I told you in the morning, to a lady who was

967
01:14:51,847 --> 01:14:52,887
doing Hatha Yoga.

968
01:14:52,914 --> 01:14:59,284
I told her how Hatha Yoga in the modern times
means nothing but physical acrobats.

969
01:14:59,284 --> 01:15:00,774
It is not that.

970
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:06,524
Hatha Yoga was practiced about, I don’t
know how many years back, about eight thousand

971
01:15:06,524 --> 01:15:12,524
years back, when we had a different system
of life, where children from five to twenty-five

972
01:15:12,524 --> 01:15:18,224
lived with a guru who was a realized soul,
and led a very celibate life.

973
01:15:18,224 --> 01:15:25,774
To such an extent that, that university, any
university – say somebody’s university

974
01:15:25,774 --> 01:15:31,884
was Vishwamitra, then that realized soul was
Vishwamitra and that university people could

975
01:15:31,884 --> 01:15:34,044
not marry, even today they cannot marry.

976
01:15:34,044 --> 01:15:35,794
Even today they cannot marry each other.

977
01:15:35,794 --> 01:15:38,864
The celibacy of that kind was present in those
days.

978
01:15:38,864 --> 01:15:43,914
And in that time when you were completely
celibate, you were innocent, you were given

979
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,784
these Ashtang Yogas.

980
01:15:45,784 --> 01:15:54,104
There are eightfold paths [DEL: of Sahaj]
of this Hatha Yoga, out of which eighth one

981
01:15:54,104 --> 01:16:00,484
is Yama-niyama where the discipline and things
are there to maintain a proper life that was

982
01:16:00,484 --> 01:16:02,104
given to them.

983
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:08,744
And then after that when that was done, the
maintenance of the proper life and all that

984
01:16:08,744 --> 01:16:14,974
was taught, also they were told the exercises
when according to the movement of the Kundalini

985
01:16:14,974 --> 01:16:17,494
wherever was the problem.

986
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:23,784
Supposing the problem is in your particular
center, then you have to do that movement,

987
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:26,974
that particular exercise you have to do.

988
01:16:26,974 --> 01:16:30,544
But it’s, as I told you this morning, that
your car has not started, you are still at

989
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:34,164
home and you are paying the toll for what?

990
01:16:34,164 --> 01:16:38,994
You must move, to find out where is the obstruction,
then you pay the toll.

991
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:45,274
And nowadays it is so absurd that we take
[DEL: the Saha–] the Hatha Yoga in such

992
01:16:45,274 --> 01:16:50,524
a manner that we take the whole medicine box
without having any disease and get diseased.

993
01:16:50,524 --> 01:16:52,544
It’s a big science.

994
01:16:52,544 --> 01:16:57,954
Is a very big science one has to understand
that everything is correlated: How is your

995
01:16:57,954 --> 01:17:03,354
center, which center is catching, what center
requires what kind of treatment, how to clear

996
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:05,706
it, and this technique you will learn in no
time.

997
01:17:05,731 --> 01:17:08,910
It’s very simple, once you get your realization.

998
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:14,708
Question: Is there anything that we can start
doing now?

999
01:17:14,748 --> 01:17:18,101
Shri Mataji: Yes, just now I’m going to
give you realization.

1000
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,593
All right?

1001
01:17:19,695 --> 01:17:22,935
That’s it, that’s just like a seeker,
just like a seeker.

1002
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:23,935
[Warren: On the sheet it tells them how to
meditate as well.

1003
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:26,188
Shri Mataji: Oh that I will tell later.]

1004
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:26,911
Ha.

1005
01:17:26,936 --> 01:17:28,172
Now what about you?

1006
01:17:28,197 --> 01:17:30,255
You have been raising your hand.

1007
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,184
Question: What kind of a… what kind of a
yoga did Lord Krishna practice?

1008
01:17:33,184 --> 01:17:36,554
Shri Mataji: Sahaj Yoga.

1009
01:17:36,554 --> 01:17:39,084
[Shri Mataji chuckles.]

1010
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:45,404
Question: According to Yogananda, he said
that Lord Krishna practiced Kriya Yoga.

1011
01:17:45,404 --> 01:17:46,754
Shri Mataji: Not at all, Is wrong.

1012
01:17:46,754 --> 01:17:48,548
He, it is just to apportion of himself to
[INDISTINCT: you.]

1013
01:17:48,548 --> 01:17:52,564
You see, Shri Krishna, if I have time I can
tell them, He in His Gita, He has prescribed

1014
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:53,932
four things.

1015
01:17:53,947 --> 01:18:01,137
But Krishna was an incarnation of diplomacy;
He was an incarnation of divine diplomacy

1016
01:18:01,137 --> 01:18:10,017
we should say, because when he told Arjuna
that you find it within yourself, the first

1017
01:18:10,017 --> 01:18:13,887
thing, – He was not a businessman, so He
told the best thing first.

1018
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:18,067
He said, “Find it within yourself the gyana,
the awareness.”

1019
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:22,687
In your awareness you should find it, you
should find your Spirit, should become that.

1020
01:18:22,687 --> 01:18:25,597
This is the first thing He told.

1021
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:32,797
But he was, that time a mediocre, an intellectual
I should say, and he said that “You are

1022
01:18:32,797 --> 01:18:38,587
telling me to fight the war and here You are
saying that you find yourself and you become

1023
01:18:38,587 --> 01:18:41,907
yourself, and to be a witness!”

1024
01:18:41,907 --> 01:18:46,177
What Shri Krishna meant was that you become
a witness, then the whole thing becomes a

1025
01:18:46,177 --> 01:18:48,697
drama, but he didn’t understand.

1026
01:18:48,697 --> 01:18:56,587
He, being a father, I give an analogy of a
father who is telling his son that, “The

1027
01:18:56,587 --> 01:19:02,748
horse is behind the cart, so put the horse
in front so the cart will move.”

1028
01:19:02,773 --> 01:19:07,503
But the son is saying that “Why not sitting
down here I move the cart?”

1029
01:19:07,503 --> 01:19:09,993
So he says, “All right, go ahead.”

1030
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:14,533
He says, “All right, go ahead,” because
if you tell them straightforward they don’t

1031
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:17,533
listen to you so tell them in another way.

1032
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:24,073
So the diplomacy, as the essence that you
give absurd conditions, such absurd conditions

1033
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:28,463
that people discover later on and find that
it was absurd.

1034
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:40,403
So the absurd condition He said that the first
thing you do is to do your karmas, do what

1035
01:19:40,403 --> 01:19:44,393
you want to do and put it at the lotus feet
of the Lord – is an absurd condition.

1036
01:19:44,393 --> 01:19:51,463
You cannot do it because your ego is intact,
you may believe, “I am serving the Lord.”

1037
01:19:51,463 --> 01:19:55,523
You may believe it, “believe” is different
from reality, you are not.

1038
01:19:55,523 --> 01:20:00,723
Because ego is there, and that’s why you
feel hurt, sometimes you take the credit.

1039
01:20:00,723 --> 01:20:04,336
Unless and until you are realized, unless
and until you become a holy personality you’ll

1040
01:20:04,361 --> 01:20:06,156
never say like that.

1041
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:11,286
After realization what do you say, “It’s
going, it’s coming, Mother it’s not working,

1042
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:12,609
it just doesn’t work.”

1043
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:15,051
“It,” you start talking in a third person.

1044
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:19,023
You don’t say, “I’m giving you realization,”
you don’t say so.

1045
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:20,476
“It’s not working.

1046
01:20:22,271 --> 01:20:23,562
It has worked.

1047
01:20:23,704 --> 01:20:24,704
It has come up.”

1048
01:20:24,729 --> 01:20:25,729
“What?”

1049
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:26,381
”Realization.”

1050
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:27,811
You don’t say “I.”

1051
01:20:28,686 --> 01:20:32,836
So you become an akarmi, means like the sun
shines, it doesn’t say, “I shine.”

1052
01:20:32,836 --> 01:20:37,836
There is no karma attached, this was the first
thing He said.

1053
01:20:37,836 --> 01:20:41,646
But this absurdity people never saw, and they
– even today people say, “I am serving

1054
01:20:41,646 --> 01:20:42,646
the Lord.”

1055
01:20:42,646 --> 01:20:48,126
But you are not even connected, how are you
serving Him?

1056
01:20:48,126 --> 01:20:50,306
That’s one thing.

1057
01:20:50,306 --> 01:20:55,736
Because there is ego, you are identified with
ego; actually you are serving your ego.

1058
01:20:55,736 --> 01:20:59,416
Unless and until you become realized, you
do not serve God.

1059
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:02,566
This is one point which was absurd, He told.

1060
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,936
Then second point – this is Karma Yoga.

1061
01:21:04,936 --> 01:21:10,846
The second point He said was, that “You
should do Bhakti Yoga.”

1062
01:21:10,846 --> 01:21:16,376
Bhakti Yoga is that you should worship Him,
worship God, pray to Him.

1063
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:22,196
But as usual because He was diplomacy He put
a very interesting word called Ananya.

1064
01:21:22,196 --> 01:21:23,726
You should do Ananya Bhakti.

1065
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:26,926
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

1066
01:21:26,926 --> 01:21:36,396
When there is not the other, when you are
not the other, when you are one with God.

1067
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:39,336
That means all those people who are talking,
“Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare

1068
01:21:39,336 --> 01:21:41,936
Krishna” on Oxford Street are not connected.

1069
01:21:41,936 --> 01:21:47,756
They are spoiling their throat, will get throat
cancers.

1070
01:21:47,756 --> 01:21:50,166
You are not yet connected, you should be ananya.

1071
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:54,956
Ananya means you should be realized; you should
be connected with God.

1072
01:21:54,956 --> 01:22:01,906
Imagine, supposing your President Reagan,
I go to him and stand before his house and

1073
01:22:01,906 --> 01:22:04,636
start calling, “Reagan, Reagan, Reagan,”
I’ll be arrested.

1074
01:22:04,636 --> 01:22:08,846
I must have a proper protocol, I must have
proper permission, I should have a proper

1075
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:11,786
way of going there, isn’t it?

1076
01:22:11,786 --> 01:22:15,596
Everybody starts calling God as if He’s
in his pocket.

1077
01:22:15,596 --> 01:22:24,306
“God give me a job, give me money, give
me a car, give me this,” I mean, imagine.

1078
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:25,936
You have to be connected with God.

1079
01:22:25,936 --> 01:22:30,206
That’s what He said very clearly, “ananya,”
but these people, these are blind people they

1080
01:22:30,206 --> 01:22:32,286
cannot see through.

1081
01:22:32,286 --> 01:22:41,206
Then the third thing He said that, “It happens
within you that you get these happenings,”

1082
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:45,126
is the Kundalini Yoga.

1083
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:50,466
He said that when the Kundalini starts, the
jalandhara bhanda and all these bhandas take

1084
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,656
place when the Kundalini rises.

1085
01:22:52,656 --> 01:22:58,776
These granthis go into a particular kind of
a formation like a car when you start all

1086
01:22:58,776 --> 01:22:59,776
the engines starts moving.

1087
01:22:59,776 --> 01:23:02,306
So He described all the engine, how it moves.

1088
01:23:02,306 --> 01:23:07,236
That, this Mr. Yogananda picked up and he
said He preached Kriya Yoga.

1089
01:23:07,236 --> 01:23:11,586
That means if you, say, have a car which has
stopped which has not yet started, you move

1090
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:16,806
the wheel and you move all the machines, will
it work?

1091
01:23:16,806 --> 01:23:21,556
You cannot do it.

1092
01:23:21,556 --> 01:23:22,746
It happens automatically.

1093
01:23:22,746 --> 01:23:25,476
It is spontaneous happening within us.

1094
01:23:25,476 --> 01:23:30,216
When we eat our food how the food is digested?

1095
01:23:30,216 --> 01:23:32,096
Automatically.

1096
01:23:32,096 --> 01:23:38,886
In the same way when Kundalini rises, to support
its rise all these bhandas and all these kriyas

1097
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:44,856
take place and kechari, also your tongue is
pulled in, so people they cut their tongues,

1098
01:23:44,856 --> 01:23:46,496
put it back.

1099
01:23:46,496 --> 01:23:48,676
Is that the way?

1100
01:23:48,676 --> 01:23:51,746
Is absolutely artificial, is stupid.

1101
01:23:51,746 --> 01:23:56,526
To do like that, many people I have seen.

1102
01:23:56,526 --> 01:24:00,156
I don’t know the early ones who came, of
Yogananda they had the tongues wagging like

1103
01:24:00,156 --> 01:24:01,156
that?

1104
01:24:01,156 --> 01:24:05,466
Imagine by doing all these things, “take
out your eyes, take out your nose.”

1105
01:24:05,466 --> 01:24:09,166
This is not the way.

1106
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:17,196
And that, “You suffer, you shave your heads,
wear a kind of a cloth,” you cannot.

1107
01:24:17,196 --> 01:24:22,996
It’s a thing that’s living within you
and acts in a living way.

1108
01:24:22,996 --> 01:24:26,156
You cannot just maneuver it artificially,
you cannot.

1109
01:24:26,156 --> 01:24:27,746
It has to start!.

1110
01:24:27,746 --> 01:24:33,056
Like even this camera, you see, a television,
anything, this has to be put to the mains.

1111
01:24:33,056 --> 01:24:36,806
You cannot start with your finger the camera
working, can you?

1112
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:41,557
The electricity has to be there, in the same
way energy of Kundalini has to be there to

1113
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:44,135
work it out.

1114
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,541
This is absurd.

1115
01:24:50,656 --> 01:24:55,525
So the Kriya Yoga, which is described by Shri
Krishna, is the living process.

1116
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:58,550
He said, “Is the living tree.”

1117
01:25:00,007 --> 01:25:01,356
I’m surprised.

1118
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:09,366
We can… human beings are very great, I must
say, the way they make a pai out of everyone.

1119
01:25:09,366 --> 01:25:16,226
So all these great incarnations came on this
earth; they wrote it very clearly; they said

1120
01:25:16,226 --> 01:25:24,766
everything very clearly; it was very simple;
there was nothing to be so much deluded – of

1121
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:26,546
course he used a word like ananya.

1122
01:25:26,546 --> 01:25:30,756
You see in any dictionary what is the meaning
of word ananya is, mean is “when is there

1123
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:38,636
is not the other.”

1124
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:42,686
What have we made of Christ, what have we
made of Krishna, what have we made of Rama?

1125
01:25:42,686 --> 01:25:45,196
When I see this I’m amazed.

1126
01:25:45,196 --> 01:25:52,216
But you can’t make anything out of Me, because
you will get your realization.

1127
01:25:52,216 --> 01:25:58,666
After that, if you try to do anything to Me,
you lose your vibrations, straightforward.

1128
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:00,596
I can tell you this much.

1129
01:26:00,596 --> 01:26:05,206
There was a gentleman who got his realization
from Me, an Indian.

1130
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:11,246
Typically he went to New York, started his
thing and then in Los Angeles he started a

1131
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:18,416
Sahaj Yoga center, and he came back to see
Me in Bombay, and the Sahaj Yogis told that

1132
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:20,766
“He is just giving us a fit.

1133
01:26:20,766 --> 01:26:22,486
Is horrible.

1134
01:26:22,486 --> 01:26:25,926
His vibrations are horrible.”

1135
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:28,222
I said, “I know that, you don’t talk to
him.”

1136
01:26:28,247 --> 01:26:30,826
So I called him, I said, “What do you do?”

1137
01:26:30,826 --> 01:26:37,836
“Oh, I have started a big thing there in
Los Angeles and in New York and this and that.”

1138
01:26:37,836 --> 01:26:40,596
“All right, can I have a brochure?”

1139
01:26:40,596 --> 01:26:47,536
You won’t believe he had written, that for
ordinary vibrations seventy-five dollars and

1140
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:52,416
for extraordinary, special vibrations hundred
and seventy-five dollars.

1141
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,926
So I said, “Oh God, what’s this?”

1142
01:26:55,926 --> 01:26:57,606
I said, “How do you do this way?”

1143
01:26:57,606 --> 01:26:59,956
He says, “Yes Mother, that’s [DEL: what]
how we are to do.

1144
01:26:59,956 --> 01:27:01,176
After all, I have to live.”

1145
01:27:01,176 --> 01:27:05,026
I said, “You have to live, all right, you
do your work that you were doing.

1146
01:27:05,026 --> 01:27:09,426
You were teaching something, you do that,
but you cannot sell these vibrations; I didn’t

1147
01:27:09,426 --> 01:27:10,726
give you for selling.

1148
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:12,566
Did you buy from Me?”

1149
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:16,066
And he wouldn’t believe.

1150
01:27:16,066 --> 01:27:20,586
And he was very angry and then he went away.

1151
01:27:20,586 --> 01:27:24,916
He said, “There’s a guru who is in Calicut,
He’s a very wonderful man.”

1152
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:26,596
I said, “You go and see him.”

1153
01:27:26,596 --> 01:27:30,146
He went and saw him, and this guru wouldn’t
allow him to enter into his house.

1154
01:27:30,146 --> 01:27:31,196
He threw stones at him.

1155
01:27:31,196 --> 01:27:33,086
He wouldn’t allow him to enter even the
gate.

1156
01:27:33,086 --> 01:27:40,476
So he went back to the station, so he was
sitting down there, then somebody met him

1157
01:27:40,476 --> 01:27:45,576
from the guru, he said that “Guru was saying
that, ‘he went and insulted Mother and how

1158
01:27:45,576 --> 01:27:47,326
does he come to be here?

1159
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:49,956
I’ll not see his face.’”

1160
01:27:49,956 --> 01:27:56,506
Then he sat there for three days, and he was
allowed to go, and then guru sent a very good

1161
01:27:56,506 --> 01:28:00,666
poem about Me in Sanskrit language, which
he read it out to Me.

1162
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:03,876
But the fellow is just the same still.

1163
01:28:03,876 --> 01:28:08,766
He’s not changed; he’s just the same.

1164
01:28:08,766 --> 01:28:12,996
Now he has no vibrations, he’s not a Sahaj
yogi, he has nothing to do, but he has an

1165
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:14,976
ashram, he’s making money out of it.

1166
01:28:14,976 --> 01:28:17,726
Of course we have withdrawn our photographs
and everything but he’s just the same, what

1167
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:19,286
am I to do?

1168
01:28:19,286 --> 01:28:24,436
He is now making them stand on their heads
and do all kinds of things.

1169
01:28:24,436 --> 01:28:26,536
And he has more people than you are here.

1170
01:28:26,536 --> 01:28:30,736
That’s the best part of it.

1171
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:33,666
People are more attracted to these things
than to reality.

1172
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:36,866
Is very true.

1173
01:28:36,866 --> 01:28:42,076
When I came last time to America there was
a lady.

1174
01:28:42,076 --> 01:28:45,516
I told her that, “Your guru was believing
in all miracles, and you better not start

1175
01:28:45,516 --> 01:28:46,516
it.”

1176
01:28:46,516 --> 01:28:47,676
She said, “No, no, no, no.

1177
01:28:47,676 --> 01:28:50,736
I want the ultimate, I want the parama, I’m
not going to go into it.”

1178
01:28:50,736 --> 01:28:52,216
I said, “All right.

1179
01:28:52,216 --> 01:28:53,216
Promise Me.”

1180
01:28:53,216 --> 01:28:54,216
She said, “Yes.”

1181
01:28:54,216 --> 01:28:58,236
But then she started getting some sort of
a rice falling from her hand and all that

1182
01:28:58,236 --> 01:29:01,646
and then she started doing her things, you
see?

1183
01:29:01,646 --> 01:29:06,336
She called people told them even the name
of the horses which are going to win, all

1184
01:29:06,336 --> 01:29:07,546
sorts of things.

1185
01:29:07,546 --> 01:29:15,116
And you won’t believe, when I went back
to America to My most embarrassed condition,

1186
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:21,956
I found that she had three thousand disciples
falling at her feet.

1187
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:26,006
And she was absolutely possessed.

1188
01:29:26,006 --> 01:29:27,776
She came to Me and I told her, “What are
you doing?”

1189
01:29:27,776 --> 01:29:29,866
She said, “Mother, this is the powers You
have given me.”

1190
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:34,802
I said, “I have never given you these powers
to beat people and tell them about horses.

1191
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,483
Is absurd.”

1192
01:29:36,568 --> 01:29:39,456
She said, “But this is happening to me.”

1193
01:29:39,456 --> 01:29:42,896
I said, “All supraconscious, all nonsense.”

1194
01:29:42,896 --> 01:29:44,846
She wouldn’t listen.

1195
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:48,546
I said, “All right, tell this gentleman
about his future.”

1196
01:29:48,546 --> 01:29:50,066
She told him something.

1197
01:29:50,066 --> 01:29:53,486
He said , “It’s all wrong, it’s not
true.”

1198
01:29:53,486 --> 01:29:55,626
I said, “Tell this lady.”

1199
01:29:55,626 --> 01:29:56,906
She couldn’t tell.

1200
01:29:56,906 --> 01:30:01,186
So she said, “Mother, have you taken away
my powers?”

1201
01:30:01,186 --> 01:30:03,516
I said, “If they were your powers, I would
have garlanded, I would have worshiped you,

1202
01:30:03,516 --> 01:30:06,706
but they are not yours, they have gone, finished.”

1203
01:30:06,706 --> 01:30:10,993
But she would not give up, you see popularity,
she was on with it.

1204
01:30:11,649 --> 01:30:15,252
Now only thing is she’s in a lunatic asylum.

1205
01:30:15,823 --> 01:30:26,276
So all these things they do, they know how
to make these things, they are so superficial.

1206
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:30,766
They don’t know what injuries they are doing
to themselves and to others.

1207
01:30:37,323 --> 01:30:40,101
Now, who were asking some question?

1208
01:30:40,126 --> 01:30:40,812
Man.

1209
01:30:40,837 --> 01:30:45,087
I wanted to ask You about the meditations
from the Maharishi Mahayoga, what Your opinion

1210
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:46,040
was.

1211
01:30:46,095 --> 01:30:52,025
Shri Mataji: Now again the controversy, again
the controversy, the less said the better.

1212
01:30:52,025 --> 01:30:54,095
All right?

1213
01:30:54,095 --> 01:30:55,186
Man: The what?

1214
01:30:55,186 --> 01:30:58,565
Shri Mataji: The less said the better.

1215
01:30:58,565 --> 01:31:04,333
For example, the mantras he gives you.

1216
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:10,052
You know what they mean, one of them, inga
? It means “the tail of the scorpion.”

1217
01:31:10,077 --> 01:31:13,975
Now where is the scorpion and where is the
tail?

1218
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,290
When the Kundalini has started, then you should
know which center it is catching and what

1219
01:31:20,315 --> 01:31:21,812
mantra to be said.

1220
01:31:21,837 --> 01:31:25,797
It is not that you can just give a mantra
and charge three hundred pounds, and people

1221
01:31:25,797 --> 01:31:27,964
do pay.

1222
01:31:28,675 --> 01:31:32,645
And this flying squad that he has started,
the head of that flying squad here he is,

1223
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:34,560
is sitting down here, he will tell you.

1224
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,620
The head of that where he went and learnt
from him flying, so called, he suffered from

1225
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,860
epilepsy, his wife suffered from epilepsy,
his daughter suffered from epilepsy, and they

1226
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:50,670
came to Me and they wrote to him about Me,
in that miserable condition.

1227
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:54,910
He was the head; he was going to teach them
flying.

1228
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:59,500
I told him, “Why don’t you ask your guru
to go on this leaning tower of Pisa and make

1229
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,670
him fly?

1230
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:06,460
And you pay him some money for that, will
be good idea.”

1231
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:09,030
They paid three thousand pounds for flying.

1232
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:17,010
You are not going to become birds now, are
you?

1233
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:21,850
But it is very difficult, you know, to accept
really because you have paid so much money.

1234
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:26,051
This is like, “We have paid it, so better
have it.”

1235
01:32:26,051 --> 01:32:27,051
You see whatever…

1236
01:32:27,051 --> 01:32:32,570
Like you go to a restaurant and you pay for
it, and may be bad but you eat it.

1237
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:36,770
You see, after all, you have paid for it.

1238
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:38,590
That’s human nature, isn’t it?

1239
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:39,690
Oh, it’s terrible.

1240
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:44,250
It’s terrible, and difficult to give realization
to people from all these gurus, I can tell

1241
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:46,610
you, Yogananda… or this, what’s his name
is?

1242
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:48,670
This Bhandasura’s name, what is his name?

1243
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:49,670
Warren: Muktananda.

1244
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:50,670
Shri Mataji: Muktananda.

1245
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:54,390
I know them very well, I know them.

1246
01:32:54,390 --> 01:33:01,100
I’ve known them for ages, and they know
Me too.

1247
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,820
Yes?

1248
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:15,140
Lady: Are there other sources where you can
reach your realization other than through

1249
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:16,140
You?

1250
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,140
[Warren repeats the question.]

1251
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,140
Shri Mataji: Through Me?

1252
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:22,020
It’s not a question of through Me or anything;
it’s through your Kundalini, is your Kundalini

1253
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,020
within you.

1254
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,100
Lady: Is there someone else that can guide
you or…?

1255
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:28,250
Shri Mataji: I don’t know, I haven’t seen
many.

1256
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:32,070
I wish somebody could, like – you see people
are very much hurt to see that I’m doing

1257
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,070
it.

1258
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:35,210
I said, “Baba, you do it.

1259
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:37,310
I’ll be very happy to retire, really.”

1260
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,840
They said, “Why You, Mother?”

1261
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,020
I said, “Really, I don’t know why I was
chosen for this.

1262
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,870
It’s a thankless job.

1263
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:48,560
You must have tremendous patience, I tell
you.

1264
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,430
The day I retire my husband will pay you for
that.

1265
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:55,850
I can assure you.”

1266
01:33:55,850 --> 01:34:04,010
He’s telling Me that “You are trying to
put patches to the heavens which are falling.”

1267
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:07,080
He doesn’t believe that I can do it.

1268
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:11,640
Is a thankless job, absolutely a thankless
job.

1269
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,170
But what to do?

1270
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:22,240
Once I did feel little frustrated, and I said,
“Let it be now.

1271
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:26,250
Doesn’t matter, let the destruction come
in.”

1272
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:33,580
And then you know this clever man, he brought
a photograph of Mine, with My eyes so compassionate,

1273
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,040
such compassion flowing, I said, “Better
do it.

1274
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,278
It’s You, what can You do?

1275
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:41,310
You can’t get out of it, that’s what You
are.”

1276
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:45,020
So I have to do it, My children, I have to
do it.

1277
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,760
If you could do it, I’ll be very happy.

1278
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,790
Any one, I’ll be extremely happy and retire.

1279
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:58,510
Warren softly: Other Sahaja Yogis can.

1280
01:34:58,510 --> 01:35:01,910
Shri Mataji: Ha, Of course!

1281
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:04,580
Other Sahaj yogis can give you realization.

1282
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:09,910
For example Warren himself has given realization
to I don’t know how many thousand.

1283
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:16,280
But I know of a person who has given realization
to more than ten thousand people, in India.

1284
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,280
Yes!

1285
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:21,930
Yes, yes, you can give realization, you can
give it, all right?

1286
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:28,550
Man: Is the lotus position any special advantage
over sitting normally?

1287
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:31,770
Warren: Is the lotus position any special
advantage?

1288
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:35,120
Shri Mataji: Not in Sahaj Yoga, not in Sahaj
Yoga.

1289
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:43,020
You see now God has decided to give you in
any position you sit; He has to save His creation.

1290
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:47,890
Many people can’t even sit on the ground,
so they are not to be forced now.

1291
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:49,990
Whatever position you have, you are all right.

1292
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:52,260
You drink, all right.

1293
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:53,330
You take drugs, all right.

1294
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,870
You are a thief, all right.

1295
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:58,200
Any kind, come along.

1296
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,860
Once you get realization these things will
drop out.

1297
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:04,600
This is the trick.

1298
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,790
Better come along and have it.

1299
01:36:08,868 --> 01:36:13,119
There’s no position required, nothing required,
only the desire to

1300
01:36:13,243 --> 01:36:16,631
be the Spirit, that’s all.

1301
01:36:16,656 --> 01:36:18,702
First one man: We’ll take it.

1302
01:36:18,727 --> 01:36:20,114
[several people start to echo the request:
“We’ll take it.”]

1303
01:36:20,123 --> 01:36:22,943
Warren: They want it.

1304
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:24,419
Shri Mataji: Now they want it, that’s all.

1305
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:25,402
Man: May we have it.

1306
01:36:25,427 --> 01:36:26,810
Shri Mataji: So, that’s all, that’s the
best way.
1307
01:37:09,700 --> 01:36:26,895
All right?

1307
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,105
Now those who got

1308
01:36:29,129 --> 01:36:32,329
it yesterday are here, some of them, and those
who have come for

1309
01:36:32,371 --> 01:36:36,371
the first time are also here.

1310
01:36:36,429 --> 01:36:39,729
Two ladies: what’s wrong with that?

1311
01:36:39,754 --> 01:36:41,341
What was that again?

1312
01:36:41,366 --> 01:36:43,620
Warren: They just want
You

1313
01:36:45,247 --> 01:36:48,386
Shri Mataji: No, yesterday some people got
realization and

1314
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:49,284
some of

1315
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:51,849
you are new people.

1316
01:36:53,048 --> 01:37:00,432
We’ll have to, later on, see them, those
who are new.

1317
01:37:00,465 --> 01:37:02,740
would like to meet them.

1318
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:04,732
As yesterday I couldn’t meet them.

1319
01:37:04,757 --> 01:37:09,757
So I would like to meet them and those who
are new, also we’ll if we can work it out…
