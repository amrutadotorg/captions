WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:08.890
It is a great pleasure for Me,

00:10.890 --> 00:12.940
greatest joy

00:13.880 --> 00:17.000
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

00:19.531 --> 00:21.940
for the Guru Puja.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.960
It’s very gratifying

00:27.404 --> 00:30.930
to think that there are so many,

00:31.539 --> 00:39.820
so many of you who are disciples.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.890
It was never expected

00:52.000 --> 00:54.820
that I’ll have so many,

00:55.460 --> 01:00.980
so many people following Me.

01:05.900 --> 01:15.980
It is being expected

01:18.840 --> 01:20.820
that you all will

01:22.860 --> 01:29.790
follow My message of Love.

01:33.010 --> 01:38.980
I do not have to say anything for Love.

01:41.860 --> 01:50.930
Love is absolute gift,

01:54.810 --> 02:01.790
gift of just feeling others.

02:04.790 --> 02:08.980
There is no talking about it,

02:09.860 --> 02:13.780
discussing about it, nothing;

02:14.780 --> 02:20.930
just you feel that Love.

02:24.930 --> 02:32.890
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

02:33.870 --> 02:36.780
but how can you have a heart?

02:37.930 --> 02:44.810
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

02:47.010 --> 02:55.950
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

02:57.790 --> 02:59.970
that you can feel that Love.

03:02.980 --> 03:09.010
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

03:10.790 --> 03:17.780
Love has its own qualities

03:19.000 --> 03:25.830
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.900
Its understanding is not in words,

03:30.840 --> 03:32.780
not in thought,

03:33.860 --> 03:36.780
but understands within.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.950
It can feel within,

03:45.780 --> 03:47.010
which is very important.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.950
This is the most important part

03:54.820 --> 03:56.890
one has to realize

03:58.920 --> 04:04.840
that Love you can only feel it.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.790
You cannot talk about it,

04:09.840 --> 04:11.920
you cannot show about it,

04:12.920 --> 04:16.010
but it is within and you can feel it.

04:19.890 --> 04:21.930
And that is why today

04:22.810 --> 04:30.890
is your celebration of the Guru.

04:33.970 --> 04:36.000
It’s the celebration where

04:38.970 --> 04:45.810
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

04:46.970 --> 04:51.950
That feeling is within

04:53.870 --> 04:58.860
and only in within you can feel that.

04:59.970 --> 05:05.940
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

05:07.840 --> 05:12.010
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

05:13.000 --> 05:19.970
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.930
This you can have because

05:26.790 --> 05:30.010
it is just there.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.970
No one can give you,

05:34.010 --> 05:36.790
no one can sell it,

05:37.780 --> 05:41.870
no one can share it - it’s just there.

05:43.810 --> 05:49.810
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

05:51.810 --> 05:56.000
It has nothing to do with others;

05:57.950 --> 06:01.980
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.810
It’s within yourself,

06:07.920 --> 06:09.790
this feeling,

06:10.810 --> 06:15.970
this depth is there which you enjoy.

06:22.910 --> 06:26.910
It is the capacity -

06:27.990 --> 06:32.860
every one has this, lots of it.

06:34.830 --> 06:39.000
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

06:39.800 --> 06:42.890
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

06:43.830 --> 06:54.850
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.930
Sea, you cannot say

06:58.850 --> 07:01.990
today is full and tomorrow is not.

07:02.910 --> 07:04.910
It is eternal.

07:05.930 --> 07:12.860
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

07:14.800 --> 07:21.960
You cannot measure it,

07:27.930 --> 07:30.830
it’s difficult.

07:33.020 --> 07:37.890
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

07:38.890 --> 07:49.910
and it shows your understanding,

07:51.830 --> 07:53.930
your understanding of Love,

07:54.860 --> 07:56.910
which has no words,

07:57.940 --> 07:59.930
which cannot explain;

08:00.940 --> 08:03.880
but by itself you will know

08:04.850 --> 08:08.910
that "I have this quality to love

08:09.830 --> 08:11.930
within myself

08:12.850 --> 08:17.940
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

08:18.930 --> 08:28.860
This is a very unique gift

08:30.020 --> 08:38.830
which only very few human beings have.

08:41.860 --> 08:46.940
Among animals also you find people who have love,

08:47.990 --> 08:52.830
but that love is not deep,

08:53.800 --> 08:56.800
that love has no meaning.

08:59.910 --> 09:03.880
It has some purpose maybe,

09:04.830 --> 09:07.010
but it is not human,

09:08.820 --> 09:12.960
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

09:13.960 --> 09:21.910
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.020
It is not easy to describe

09:28.970 --> 09:34.020
or explain Love in human words.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.830
This you can only feel within your Self.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.930
That is what, once you start feeling,

09:45.800 --> 09:50.930
you can feel who is your Guru,

09:52.880 --> 10:00.970
Whom do you think you are being taught

10:01.020 --> 10:08.830
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.930
All that is possible.

10:15.790 --> 10:17.020
Everything is possible,

10:17.860 --> 10:19.830
humanly possible,

10:19.940 --> 10:25.820
but to love and to enjoy Love

10:25.870 --> 10:28.850
is not so easy,

10:29.800 --> 10:33.900
unless and until you are immersed in it.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.790
It’s very gratifying,

10:42.970 --> 10:47.970
it is very lovable

10:49.820 --> 10:52.960
to see how people love each other

10:55.960 --> 11:04.020
and then this Love spreads.

11:06.930 --> 11:09.970
Love begets Love.

11:11.930 --> 11:19.790
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.830
You need not tell anyone,

11:23.940 --> 11:25.990
you need not confess it,

11:26.800 --> 11:30.880
but it will spread.

11:31.910 --> 11:36.940
And this is what one has to learn,

11:38.890 --> 11:43.940
how to see that Love in other person.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.850
Somehow,

11:51.910 --> 11:56.920
we are here already in Love

11:57.910 --> 12:02.020
because of Sahaj happening.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.970
We all love

12:06.890 --> 12:08.920
and we enjoy love,

12:09.860 --> 12:11.880
shows on our faces

12:12.860 --> 12:15.020
that we are in Love;

12:15.990 --> 12:18.800
in our characters,

12:20.830 --> 12:22.810
in our lives,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.800
that we are in Love.

12:26.890 --> 12:28.830
What a thing,

12:28.980 --> 12:32.910
which is not very normal,

12:32.970 --> 12:35.020
becomes so normal

12:35.940 --> 12:38.860
and so easily available.

12:39.830 --> 12:42.920
It is a very big blessing

12:43.920 --> 12:46.020
that you are human beings

12:46.910 --> 12:52.870
and that this source of Love

12:53.910 --> 12:59.860
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

13:00.830 --> 13:05.020
It’s a very intricate situation

13:05.920 --> 13:09.830
which cannot be explained in words,

13:11.870 --> 13:15.840
only one can be in it

13:15.920 --> 13:17.950
and enjoy it.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.910
So today is the day

13:22.970 --> 13:29.000
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

13:31.860 --> 13:38.920
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

13:39.890 --> 13:46.840
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

13:47.780 --> 13:49.940
which somehow or other leads us.

13:50.940 --> 13:55.020
We are lead into that

13:55.920 --> 14:02.880
great line of understanding,

14:03.970 --> 14:07.860
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

14:07.970 --> 14:10.940
to any school for education.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.780
It is something so much within

14:14.950 --> 14:24.910
that it works and expresses itself,

14:25.800 --> 14:28.940
expresses like a light.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.830
Such people we can make out because

14:33.980 --> 14:36.860
they are fully enlightened.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.830
They have light

14:39.980 --> 14:42.800
and through that light they see

14:42.940 --> 14:44.870
the whole world,

14:45.000 --> 14:49.780
which is very innocent and simple for them.

14:57.810 --> 15:03.890
We have love for our children naturally,

15:04.810 --> 15:07.880
we have love for our parents naturally.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.780
We have love for some people;

15:12.910 --> 15:14.940
but that love is different

15:15.780 --> 15:18.860
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.910
That has some connections,

15:24.780 --> 15:25.990
some meanings

15:26.830 --> 15:35.970
but this Love which is -

15:38.880 --> 15:43.910
cannot be described in words,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.890
has to be felt within.

15:49.860 --> 15:52.980
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

15:54.830 --> 15:59.020
you should have that Love within you.

16:01.780 --> 16:05.860
Why do you feel it so much?

16:08.970 --> 16:14.910
The reason is, Guru loves you

16:15.920 --> 16:17.970
and you love Guru;

16:18.910 --> 16:21.020
That’s the only reason

16:21.920 --> 16:24.890
why should you love your Guru.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.020
Now, there's no reason for that.

16:28.950 --> 16:31.830
Because Love is Love.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.840
and that is how

16:35.860 --> 16:40.020
the Guru becomes very important in life.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.800
We have people

16:44.000 --> 16:47.950
who love their Guru

16:49.860 --> 16:51.940
and are very much

16:53.970 --> 17:02.800
in chaste understanding of their Love.

17:04.910 --> 17:09.830
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

17:10.840 --> 17:16.940
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

17:17.910 --> 17:19.860
from our heart,

17:20.880 --> 17:26.940
that there is this ocean within us,

17:28.830 --> 17:32.810
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.800
If we are lost in that ocean,

17:35.920 --> 17:39.940
then we’ll have no problems,

17:41.810 --> 17:43.860
no questions.

17:44.890 --> 17:47.910
Everything will be our own

17:48.890 --> 17:50.880
and we can manage

17:50.990 --> 17:55.880
everything without any argument,

17:55.950 --> 17:59.000
without any questioning.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.020
That is what is being Sahaj.

18:05.850 --> 18:08.810
The Sahaj way, if you have

18:08.940 --> 18:12.830
this Love, you enjoy.

18:12.950 --> 18:16.810
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

18:16.880 --> 18:18.990
because it is Sahaj.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.910
Don’t have to make any efforts,

18:22.780 --> 18:24.880
don’t have to try anything.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.990
Just it is there and it works.

18:33.860 --> 18:40.880
The feeling of Love

18:41.990 --> 18:47.890
has no way of expressing itself.

18:49.020 --> 18:51.860
It is just there,

18:52.810 --> 18:54.850
it cannot express,

18:55.990 --> 19:00.970
because it is without expression.

19:02.840 --> 19:08.000
It is just to be felt within yourself.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.990
Then you want to do so many things:

19:14.000 --> 19:16.830
you want to help everyone,

19:16.990 --> 19:19.830
you want to help yourself,

19:20.810 --> 19:24.940
you want to do good to others.

19:25.860 --> 19:30.970
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

19:31.830 --> 19:33.990
because they had that Love.

19:34.850 --> 19:37.780
They had nothing else but this Love

19:37.970 --> 19:41.920
which they could not contain them within themselves,

19:41.990 --> 19:46.020
so, they tried to spread it.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.940
And they are called now as our Guru,

19:51.860 --> 19:53.940
as our masters.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.980
With that Love within,

19:57.980 --> 20:04.020
which approached people in that unique manner.

20:05.850 --> 20:07.990
That’s the thing that

20:09.910 --> 20:11.980
we cannot possess,

20:12.830 --> 20:14.870
you cannot claim -

20:16.020 --> 20:18.020
it is there

20:18.980 --> 20:21.020
and it works,

20:22.840 --> 20:24.870
it works automatically.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.980
This is what we have to know,

20:29.790 --> 20:35.900
that we are that Love.

20:37.860 --> 20:38.980
That Love is within us.

20:39.800 --> 20:43.980
We have to have knowledge,

20:44.920 --> 20:48.840
we have to have a complete knowledge

20:48.970 --> 20:53.800
that we are that Love.

20:54.950 --> 20:57.940
That will solve our problem,

20:58.990 --> 21:00.950
because you can explain everything,

21:01.020 --> 21:02.950
all your behaviour,

21:03.890 --> 21:05.780
all your failures,

21:05.840 --> 21:07.990
everything you can explain

21:08.800 --> 21:13.810
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.950
This is what is the Guru

21:19.860 --> 21:22.810
is the Love within you

21:23.780 --> 21:25.020
which wants to share

21:25.890 --> 21:27.920
Love with others,

21:29.800 --> 21:32.990
which wants to give Love to others.

21:37.780 --> 21:42.840
This is what is peace and joy.

21:43.980 --> 21:46.950
I can go on talking on Love,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.950
but to feel it

21:54.790 --> 21:57.930
within yourself is the biggest thing.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.870
Like water:

22:01.010 --> 22:02.960
if you are thirsty,

22:03.870 --> 22:05.840
we can give you water,

22:06.020 --> 22:07.980
but we cannot drink.

22:08.850 --> 22:10.850
You have to drink water

22:10.950 --> 22:13.010
and you have to

22:15.910 --> 22:17.950
feel the taste,

22:18.870 --> 22:20.810
feel the feeling,

22:20.930 --> 22:22.880
what it does,

22:22.980 --> 22:27.020
and all that is together,

22:28.020 --> 22:30.880
that’s not separate.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.990
I don’t think the subject

22:33.790 --> 22:35.960
was too subtle for you people.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.880
You all have reached a certain amount

22:40.020 --> 22:42.990
of understanding of that Love.

22:44.950 --> 22:48.850
I hope, it grows

22:49.810 --> 22:51.900
and you grow into it,

22:52.010 --> 22:55.870
all of you, and enjoy it.

22:56.020 --> 22:58.920
May God bless you!
