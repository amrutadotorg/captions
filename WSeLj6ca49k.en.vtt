00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.649
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.769
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:18.809
on this day of Sahasrara.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.969
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.049
and new has started.

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:55.329
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:56.049 --> 00:05:01.969
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.369
And gradually –

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:28.049
(it’s not on My …, that’s the point, it’s …, that’s better) –

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:36.649
and gradually moving towards the completion,

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:45.649
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.569
It is a very natural process of growth

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.769
that you have gone through.

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:18.289
The first one was, we can say,

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.209
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.929
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:43.449
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:48.489
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:59.209
And you have the chakras same way built in,

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:02.369
in your Sahasrara.

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:15.729
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.929
the deities in your centers,

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:27.649
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:41.929
But now the time has come for us to spread it

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:46.129
on a horizontal level.

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:55.449
And to move it on the horizontal level,

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:59.689
we have to understand how to go about it.

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:17.529
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:23.249
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:26.329
of the chakras.

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:39.369
And when we start it from the back,

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:43.849
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:53.449
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:56.689
if you see it clearly.

00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:23.129
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:27.729
because it's a concave replacement,

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:34.569
is important to understand that the center

00:09:34.729 --> 00:09:44.649
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

00:09:59.689 --> 00:10:08.089
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:28.249
I hope you understand what I mean.

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:37.649
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:43.689
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

00:10:53.969 --> 00:11:01.689
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

00:11:01.849 --> 00:11:06.209
the Atma, coincide.

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:20.369
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:22.929
that is the Atma.

00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:39.729
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:54.809
At this point of time it is very important to understand

00:11:54.969 --> 00:12:00.609
that we have to take a bigger step.

00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:18.489
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:23.569
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

00:12:23.729 --> 00:12:34.849
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:58.409
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:03.969
of all the incarnations is compassion,

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:10.049
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:28.049
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:33.089
we have to have compassion.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:49.209
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:57.129
If God Almighty had no compassion,

00:13:57.289 --> 00:14:06.249
He would not have created this great universe.

00:14:13.049 --> 00:14:17.089
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

00:14:17.249 --> 00:14:22.249
is the embodiment of His compassion.

00:14:29.289 --> 00:14:35.889
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:42.889
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

00:14:53.249 --> 00:14:59.129
And compassion is always completely covered

00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:02.289
with forgiveness.

00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:17.169
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

00:15:19.849 --> 00:15:26.289
The Son of God is forgiveness,

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:29.649
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:40.569
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:44.049
the Mother who is the compassion

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.289
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:53.249
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:19.529
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:33.329
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:48.049
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

00:16:48.209 --> 00:16:50.369
as you think it to be,

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:56.369
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

00:17:05.729 --> 00:17:10.889
To develop this, you have to pay attention

00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:17.289
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

00:17:30.689 --> 00:17:35.489
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

00:17:35.649 --> 00:17:42.809
then there you must establish the deity.

00:17:54.249 --> 00:18:01.049
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

00:18:05.449 --> 00:18:08.689
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

00:18:08.849 --> 00:18:11.689
in person with you.

00:18:24.649 --> 00:18:30.049
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:34.089
had to imagine the deities,

00:18:42.009 --> 00:18:48.129
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:58.809
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:06.809
that is how it is described –

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:12.249
so if you also see the person,

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:15.369
you may not be knowing fully that person

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:19.729
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

00:19:27.649 --> 00:19:30.249
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:33.129
than your imagination.

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:42.929
That is why one has to surrender.

00:19:44.969 --> 00:19:50.729
With your limited imagination of brain,

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:56.369
one cannot see the deity.

00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:05.729
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

00:20:05.889 --> 00:20:10.809
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:18.209
So the devotion has to be there,

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:23.569
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

00:20:23.729 --> 00:20:26.409
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:29.729
Heart should be clean.

00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:42.049
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:53.849
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

00:20:54.009 --> 00:20:56.849
of reality,

00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:03.889
but reality is absolute.

00:21:05.209 --> 00:21:10.729
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

00:21:10.889 --> 00:21:17.849
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

00:21:22.929 --> 00:21:30.849
So in the beginning we try to achieve our realization,

00:21:31.529 --> 00:21:35.689
not with very clean heart.

00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:47.049
At that time we had lots of attachments,

00:21:49.049 --> 00:21:54.129
we were identified with false things.

00:21:56.729 --> 00:22:02.529
And also we thought by getting realization

00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:06.889
we’ll become very powerful people.

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:19.049
After realization also,

00:22:19.209 --> 00:22:24.049
we started indulging into petty things.

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:36.289
We started asking for favors for our relations, friends,

00:22:36.449 --> 00:22:39.609
mothers, sisters;

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:47.449
and the women thought of their husbands

00:22:47.609 --> 00:22:52.649
and their brothers, children.

00:22:55.729 --> 00:23:00.649
They all asked for the blessings of all those

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:04.729
with whom they were entangled.

00:23:14.729 --> 00:23:20.809
All this entanglement you got over, I know, very soon.

00:23:31.129 --> 00:23:34.889
Now the job of a Avatara is such

00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:41.009
that He has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

00:23:46.449 --> 00:23:52.409
The job of an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill

00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:58.649
the desires of His bhaktas, His disciples.

00:24:12.129 --> 00:24:16.729
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by gopis that

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:18.609
“we want You to be with us,

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:22.609
individually with every one of us.”

00:24:31.729 --> 00:24:35.289
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,

00:24:35.449 --> 00:24:40.409
and He was with every one of them.

00:24:46.729 --> 00:24:51.129
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:56.289
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:00.569
But when you asked Me about your brothers, sisters,

00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:04.369
mothers, fathers, I tried to do that,

00:25:04.529 --> 00:25:07.609
whatever was possible.

00:25:13.209 --> 00:25:16.649
Also the kshema that you asked for,

00:25:16.809 --> 00:25:19.049
ashrams you asked for,

00:25:19.209 --> 00:25:23.329
all the things that you needed,

00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:31.049
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.489
So at the Krishna's level it was

00:25:43.649 --> 00:25:45.729
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham."

00:25:45.889 --> 00:25:50.569
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's level,

00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:03.289
because it was promised.

00:26:04.489 --> 00:26:09.489
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:18.689
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:27.889
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

00:26:42.489 --> 00:26:47.369
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

00:26:49.849 --> 00:26:54.809
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

00:26:59.009 --> 00:27:03.969
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

00:27:04.129 --> 00:27:09.129
may dim out, or may be defective.

00:27:16.649 --> 00:27:19.889
So, all the chakras that are within us

00:27:20.049 --> 00:27:23.049
are to be looked after.

00:27:28.889 --> 00:27:36.209
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

00:27:37.449 --> 00:27:42.449
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:01.689
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

00:28:05.569 --> 00:28:10.169
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha and

00:28:10.329 --> 00:28:15.169
establish Him through your thought –

00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:18.849
because now your thought is divine –

00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:23.849
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

00:28:45.129 --> 00:28:51.209
Here now, you have to know that in the first era

00:28:51.369 --> 00:28:54.729
of Sahaja Yoga I could not have talked of these things to

00:28:54.889 --> 00:28:56.249
of these things to you, of …

00:28:56.409 --> 00:29:02.929
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:14.289
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

00:29:14.449 --> 00:29:18.289
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,

00:29:18.449 --> 00:29:22.449
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

00:29:27.729 --> 00:29:30.409
And that's the country.

00:29:32.769 --> 00:29:37.449
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:42.569
put your feelings towards Him,

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:59.209
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

00:30:03.449 --> 00:30:06.649
And then to manifest compassion,

00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:10.689
you have to ask nothing but one thing,

00:30:10.849 --> 00:30:17.489
that "O God of Innocence, give innocence

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:22.609
to all the people of the world."

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:36.009
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:40.689
otherwise it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,

00:30:40.849 --> 00:30:44.769
you have no right to ask.

00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:58.609
So to understand innocence

00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:01.249
you should try to understand yourself,

00:31:01.409 --> 00:31:05.329
how your mind is working.

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:18.009
When you, say, look at anyone, do you feel that you

00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:21.169
should possess that person?

00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:26.689
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something base feeling

00:31:26.849 --> 00:31:30.769
comes into your mind?

00:31:44.729 --> 00:31:47.129
For an innocent person,

00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:50.889
a beautiful person, or a woman,

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:55.249
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

00:31:55.409 --> 00:31:58.249
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless –

00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:01.289
there’s no thought.

00:32:15.009 --> 00:32:18.889
So if there is no thought, there's no question

00:32:19.049 --> 00:32:22.169
of having any expression of possessiveness

00:32:22.329 --> 00:32:26.249
or any kind of a baser feeling.

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:45.289
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also unauthorized

00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:49.009
a little bit, that "Please make me innocent,

00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:54.249
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon,

00:32:54.409 --> 00:33:04.209
that wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

00:33:17.689 --> 00:33:25.009
So that I emit innocence: when people look at me,

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:29.049
they feel I am innocent."

00:33:36.809 --> 00:33:39.889
This is compassion,

00:33:41.369 --> 00:33:45.369
the compassion to ask Him to give you

00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:50.449
the power of compassion itself.

00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:08.049
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

00:34:08.209 --> 00:34:15.169
the light starts moving horizontally;

00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:33.689
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:41.369
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:48.489
You don't become stupid or childish,

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:51.729
but you become child-like.

00:34:58.809 --> 00:35:06.849
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:14.409
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:19.529
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:26.489
because he puts up a show – it's a deliberation

00:35:26.649 --> 00:35:29.489
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified,

00:35:29.649 --> 00:35:32.329
to impress others.

00:35:38.689 --> 00:35:43.169
And child doesn’t put up the show of innocence, of

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:50.249
of dignity or anything, because the child is not aware

00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:53.569
of deliberations.

00:36:02.169 --> 00:36:10.049
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

00:36:18.449 --> 00:36:22.969
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

00:36:23.129 --> 00:36:28.849
expressing itself on horizontal level,

00:36:29.009 --> 00:36:33.129
that you become discreet.

00:36:41.809 --> 00:36:44.289
But that is a power, I'm again say,

00:36:44.449 --> 00:36:48.449
the power of discretion you develop.

00:36:53.009 --> 00:36:56.329
Now one must understand the difference between

00:36:56.489 --> 00:37:01.329
the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:08.409
So “the power” means it acts.

00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:15.889
For example, you may not speak, but if you are

00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:18.849
but if you are standing somewhere

00:37:19.009 --> 00:37:23.969
the discretion itself will act in the situation.

00:37:33.129 --> 00:37:36.729
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

00:37:36.889 --> 00:37:40.369
is going in a train, and the train has an accident –

00:37:40.529 --> 00:37:45.529
mostly it will not have, but has – nobody will die.

00:37:56.729 --> 00:38:05.169
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:08.009
that acts by itself.

00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:10.889
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

00:38:11.049 --> 00:38:13.289
but you just become the vehicle,

00:38:13.449 --> 00:38:18.249
a beautiful clean vehicle of that discretion.

00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:34.609
Then you should believe,

00:38:34.769 --> 00:38:38.729
now you are spreading horizontally.

00:38:48.049 --> 00:38:52.129
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:52.289 --> 00:38:56.969
you needed to see Me in person.

00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:01.649
You needed to see Me in person.

00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:11.369
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”: is the target.

00:39:11.529 --> 00:39:15.649
You wanted the target in front of you.

00:39:23.729 --> 00:39:28.889
(But see, there’s no word in English!) Dhyeya:

00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:32.929
whatever is to be achieved.

00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:38.489
(Because there’s no word in the English language, what to do?)

00:39:38.649 --> 00:39:42.529
So now when you wanted that all the time,

00:39:42.689 --> 00:39:48.249
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:53.249
when you had that in person before you.

00:40:03.849 --> 00:40:07.609
Then in the second era, now,

00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:13.169
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:16.729
you'll take it over from Me.

00:40:31.089 --> 00:40:35.929
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

00:40:39.089 --> 00:40:45.129
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

00:40:51.809 --> 00:40:53.889
I am with you, you know that;

00:40:54.049 --> 00:40:55.849
but need not be in this body,

00:40:56.009 --> 00:41:00.889
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

00:41:07.129 --> 00:41:10.409
But once this desire starts working,

00:41:10.569 --> 00:41:15.289
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

00:41:23.729 --> 00:41:26.489
When the child is born to a mother,

00:41:26.649 --> 00:41:31.049
automatically she gets milk.

00:41:37.969 --> 00:41:43.049
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:48.329
In your divine desire also it is connected.

00:41:57.289 --> 00:42:02.369
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

00:42:05.009 --> 00:42:06.929
So you may find Me anywhere:

00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:09.009
you are walking on the street,

00:42:09.169 --> 00:42:13.249
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:29.849
So this is the second era we have started,

00:42:30.009 --> 00:42:32.289
and you should not be shocked

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:36.129
if you see Me sitting on your bed

00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:41.049
and putting My hand on your head.

00:42:57.889 --> 00:43:01.129
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

00:43:01.289 --> 00:43:04.329
walking into your room,

00:43:08.689 --> 00:43:12.089
or as Shri Rama.

00:43:13.209 --> 00:43:16.049
That has to happen,

00:43:16.209 --> 00:43:19.249
so you should be prepared.

00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:29.809
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:33.049
but on a grosser level.

00:43:38.049 --> 00:43:40.929
We have seen the light coming on My head,

00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:45.849
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

00:43:53.049 --> 00:43:54.889
But many things will happen,

00:43:55.049 --> 00:44:00.009
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

00:44:07.769 --> 00:44:11.569
This has to happen, just to convince you

00:44:11.729 --> 00:44:17.169
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:23.409
in the new area of Pragyalok.

00:44:32.049 --> 00:44:35.009
Because this is a new state into which

00:44:35.169 --> 00:44:40.129
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

00:44:46.889 --> 00:44:55.049
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:11.849
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

00:45:15.689 --> 00:45:18.609
The asking will disappear,

00:45:20.049 --> 00:45:24.929
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:33.929
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

00:45:37.369 --> 00:45:47.289
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

00:45:55.169 --> 00:46:05.209
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

00:46:10.489 --> 00:46:15.369
Now the new work of compassion,

00:46:15.529 --> 00:46:21.689
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

00:46:34.409 --> 00:46:37.849
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

00:46:38.009 --> 00:46:44.929
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

00:46:53.129 --> 00:46:57.889
So you become the giver of compassion.

00:47:01.929 --> 00:47:05.369
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

00:47:05.529 --> 00:47:10.689
I have requested you how to do tapah.

00:47:13.249 --> 00:47:15.889
(Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.)

00:47:27.369 --> 00:47:34.569
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

00:47:34.729 --> 00:47:40.409
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

00:47:56.809 --> 00:48:00.089
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

00:48:00.249 --> 00:48:02.689
that you have to do, because I am told

00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:08.689
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

00:48:08.849 --> 00:48:11.289
and you people suffered a little bit

00:48:11.449 --> 00:48:15.449
on your way for the pilgrimage.

00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:34.449
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:38.009
where the devils dare not go.

00:48:41.409 --> 00:48:43.569
Fun: no word!

00:48:43.729 --> 00:48:49.809
They have never fun! Let us see, it is miserable!

00:49:03.889 --> 00:49:09.569
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

00:49:09.729 --> 00:49:12.929
discomforts, then you should know

00:49:13.089 --> 00:49:15.209
you are on the right lights.

00:49:27.889 --> 00:49:32.969
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

00:49:33.129 --> 00:49:36.969
you should know you are progressing well.

00:49:43.329 --> 00:49:46.329
As you become more peaceful and your temper

00:49:46.569 --> 00:49:50.449
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

00:49:50.609 --> 00:49:56.609
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

00:50:15.209 --> 00:50:23.849
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

00:50:24.009 --> 00:50:28.769
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

00:50:28.929 --> 00:50:32.369
then know that you are progressing.

00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:43.409
No amount ….

00:50:46.409 --> 00:50:52.809
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

00:50:52.969 --> 00:50:56.809
then know that you are progressing.

00:51:04.889 --> 00:51:13.729
No amount of material well-being in others

00:51:13.889 --> 00:51:18.769
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:22.889
then know that you are progressing well.

00:51:32.729 --> 00:51:37.529
No amount of

00:51:43.209 --> 00:51:46.369
labor or

00:51:47.489 --> 00:51:58.529
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

00:51:58.689 --> 00:52:03.089
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

00:52:03.249 --> 00:52:09.289
while you have got it without any effort.

00:52:09.449 --> 00:52:13.329
So you are something special.

00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:26.329
So this, once you understand that you are special,

00:52:26.489 --> 00:52:30.489
you will become humble about it.

00:52:35.969 --> 00:52:41.649
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:44.449
when you see you have achieved something,

00:52:44.609 --> 00:52:46.689
that you have some powers,

00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:52.609
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

00:52:52.929 --> 00:52:57.329
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

00:52:57.489 --> 00:53:01.569
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

00:53:01.729 --> 00:53:04.969
then you should believe

00:53:05.129 --> 00:53:10.009
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

00:53:28.449 --> 00:53:35.649
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:45.289
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

00:53:56.369 --> 00:54:02.609
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

00:54:02.769 --> 00:54:05.729
you will be in meditation;

00:54:11.129 --> 00:54:16.689
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

00:54:25.049 --> 00:54:33.569
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:39.489
This is what you are in for;

00:54:39.649 --> 00:54:45.689
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:49.889
on this great day of Sahasrara.

00:55:00.169 --> 00:55:04.169
May God bless you all.
