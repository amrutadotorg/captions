00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:19.875
And send Me the children ….

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.250
Now come along, wash My Feet.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:29.166
Come along, both of you, come along.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.999
Now put up your sleeves first of all,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:38.458
put up your sleeves properly. Good.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.959
Both the hands.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.166
Salutations to the one who incarnates as the past.

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:56.000
Bhuta bhava.

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:59.917
All the left side. He’s at the base of the left side,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.083
so you’ll understand what is he telling.

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:07.250
He’s the left side, the past.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.875
“Bhuta” is “past.”

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:04.875
No, ... you first say the meaning.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:07.166
Then you say this, so they will understand;

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:09.583
it goes into the head, all right? The first is the meaning.

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:14.125
Now, second one you say.

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:48.375
“Bhuta sangha” means the collection of all that is created.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:51.917
“Bhuta sanghana videha manah”:

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.417
“videha” means “ in the body”,

00:11:54.917 --> 00:12:01.792
“manah” means “in the heart of that body,” in Sanskrit.

00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:08.709
… In the heart.

00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:39.709
“Bhutatmanaha”. Atmana is the Spirit.

00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:42.166
“Bhut” means “created”: whatever is created,

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:45.834
He resides them as the Spirit.

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:50.208
“Bhutatmanaha.”

00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:42.709
Now here I would like to say that it is Shri Ganesha

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.208
who is the Omkara, who is the vibrations.

00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:50.000
So He is the truth. What He says is the truth,

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:52.834
so, what vibrations say is the truth.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.208
He's truth.

00:17:55.834 --> 00:18:00.917
So Omkara is vibrations, that is Shri Ganesh.

00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:31.834
“Paramadhama”.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.959
Too much. Too much.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:47.667
Better take one with ….

00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:20.959
Now, you have to tie up those ….

00:50:45.166 --> 00:50:47.375
Let them take photograph.

00:51:24.583 --> 00:51:26.625
Now, can you come?

00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:40.333
Be careful.

00:51:51.959 --> 00:51:54.375
Can you tie?

00:52:55.959 --> 00:52:58.417
Did you avoid in the photograph these things? Did you avoid?

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.792
...showing?

00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:11.166
No, no, take it out, that one.

00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:13.750
It’s a good photograph, all right?

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.083
So that it’s a formidable photograph.

00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:19.917
with the head of Shri Ganesha.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:30.667
May God bless you all.

01:17:23.959 --> 01:17:30.750
Oh God...Wow, beautiful. Thank you.

01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:50.583
From the italian sahaja yogis.

01:19:12.917 --> 01:19:15.500
It is too much for Me. Thank you very much.

01:19:28.959 --> 01:19:30.417
What is that?

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:07.834
Wow, beautiful! Very nice. From where did you get it?

01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:11.667
Oh, I see, is very good.

01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:19.458
What is this? She's come from Austria all the way?

01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:34.333
… Ah! From Austria! Thank you very much ….

01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:05.333
Thank you very much. How beautiful it is. Very beautiful.

01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:07.542
Thank you very much.
