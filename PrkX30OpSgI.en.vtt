WEBVTT

00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:46.017
Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha
Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birth.

00:04:49.555 --> 00:05:06.275
In the whole
map of time, Buddha came to this earth at

00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:12.535
a time when it was so important for Him to
come.

00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:34.455
That time, especially in India, we had two
types of people: one, who were very ritualistic,

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:55.475
trying to be extremely strict and disciplined;
and the another were the people who were

00:05:55.475 --> 00:06:07.034
too much conditioned and were full of so-called
devotion to God.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:23.825
So these two types of people were occupying
the area of seekers.

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:35.094
So it was necessary to neutralize these two
styles of seekings.

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:52.465
Buddha and Mahavira are, in essence, supported
by Hanumana and Bhairava - that is, as you

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:57.005
know, Gabriel and Saint Michael.

00:06:57.005 --> 00:07:10.105
The principle that took birth is the principle
of a disciple, and this principle was born

00:07:10.105 --> 00:07:17.685
much earlier as the two sons of Shri Rama.

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:30.605
This principle was brought on this earth and
incarnated: one, to conquer the ego of human

00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:39.094
beings; another one, to conquer the superego
of human beings.

00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:49.154
Buddha, when He was born, He found that there
was misery everywhere.

00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:58.185
And the misery, according to Him, was due
to the desires we have.

00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:05.205
So to be desireless is the best way to achieve
Nirvana.

00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:09.875
That's what He came to conclusion.

00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:12.025
But how to become desireless?

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:22.205
You are sitting in the sand, and if you see,
the sand doesn't get attached to anything.

00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:26.185
You put anything on it, it will not spoil
anything.

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:34.805
You put water, it will stick on, and as soon
as you try to throw it away the whole thing

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:39.315
will disappear into thin air.

00:08:39.315 --> 00:08:59.065
So to develop that kind of detachment, or
to develop a life which was desireless was

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:00.694
His aim.

00:09:00.902 --> 00:09:05.155
And that's why I say He was a Disciple Principles.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:17.495
So, the Disciple Principle has to find out
the way and method, while the Guru Principle

00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:21.944
are the people who have already found out.

00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:25.155
Because He has to create a way and path.

00:09:25.155 --> 00:09:31.885
So, He studied all kinds of books, went to
many places.

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:34.075
He read Upanishadas.

00:09:34.075 --> 00:09:41.104
Then He saw the people who are busy with Vedas
and were doing all kinds of ritualism.

00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:53.745
With the rituals, they never got the Realization,
which is actually the first verse of Veda

00:09:53.745 --> 00:10:01.784
is that, "By reading the Vedas and by doing
all the rituals of the Vedas, if you do not

00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:10.444
become vida, means self-realized, vida word
means "to know", if you don't know the Divine

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:19.354
on your central nervous system, then you are
just missing the point.

00:10:19.354 --> 00:10:22.815
It is all useless for you to read Vedas.

00:10:22.815 --> 00:10:30.194
So He went into various areas of search.

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:41.935
As today we find many seekers have been going
to many people to find out the truth.

00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:46.025
And He was tired, very tired.

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:56.375
He thought all His seeking, all His working
hard, all His efforts, everything had just

00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:57.675
made Him tired.

00:10:57.675 --> 00:11:03.075
And He thought it was all fruitless.

00:11:03.075 --> 00:11:18.164
So, He was lying under a Banyan tree, and
there the Adi Shakti gave Him Realization.

00:11:18.164 --> 00:11:30.475
When all your searches are over - people search
in money, in power, in love, and all kinds

00:11:30.475 --> 00:11:31.475
of things.

00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:40.585
Ultimately people start searching in various
groups, cults, gurus, all kinds of things

00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:46.765
- drugs, alcohol's, whichever way are possible
they try to search.

00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:53.245
But when human beings try to search something,
then in their movement they either go to the

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:56.895
left or to the right.

00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:06.444
And He, being such an ardent seeker, and such
a truthful seeker, He could see very clearly

00:12:06.444 --> 00:12:10.895
that this is not the point of going left or
right.

00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:14.985
But there has to be some ascent, but how to
achieve it?

00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:18.975
Who is going to give Him Self-Realization?

00:12:18.975 --> 00:12:28.315
All that tiredness He laid down Himself under
the tree and suddenly He got His Realization.

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:41.965
When He got His Realization, He started understanding
why this problem of conditioning and ego is

00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:42.965
there.

00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:52.765
He found out one thing: that people when they
read too much, and try to understand - through

00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:55.905
ritualism - God, then they develop their ego.

00:12:55.905 --> 00:13:04.245
The other side, He found out, that when people
just with some desires, go on praying to God,

00:13:04.245 --> 00:13:10.665
"Give me this, give me that", they become
mad.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:19.235
And when He realized it, then only at that
moment when He was tired, He got His Realization.

00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:25.215
This is exactly what is happening today in
the modern times.

00:13:25.215 --> 00:13:34.915
That those who were seekers have been seeking
the Divine on the left and right hand side.

00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:38.535
Nowadays they are jogging.

00:13:38.535 --> 00:13:41.765
I don't know what they're going to achieve
through jogging.

00:13:41.765 --> 00:13:44.275
They're jogging like mad.

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:51.495
Then there are ardent Christians, ardent Muslims,
fighting the whole world for their religion,

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:57.915
for their God, for in the name of Mohammed
Sahib, in the name of Krishna, in the name

00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:02.075
of everything.

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:07.025
Then they think their religion is in danger.

00:14:07.025 --> 00:14:08.815
I mean it is not.

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:16.215
Neither the prophets nor the incarnations,
nobody is in danger, not at all.

00:14:16.215 --> 00:14:20.315
How can they be?

00:14:20.315 --> 00:14:24.675
And no religion if it is true religion can
be in danger.

00:14:24.675 --> 00:14:29.735
But this He only realized after His Realization.

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:39.105
But His followers who came did not see the
point that ultimately it is Self-Realization

00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:41.245
He is talking.

00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:46.885
Actually he took all the care to see that
people should get their Self-Realization first.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.175
Then anything else.

00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:52.645
First of all He said, "You are not going to
worship Me."

00:14:52.645 --> 00:15:03.845
As you know we don't allow people to come
for My Puja unless and until they are fully

00:15:03.845 --> 00:15:06.635
established in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:13.455
So He first said that, "You should be fully
established in your Self-Realization, that's

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.895
all."

00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:24.125
He would not talk about God, because once
you start talking about God, then He saw all

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:27.655
these horrible religions coming up in the
name of God.

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:35.135
When I first came to America, you will be
surprised, I did not talk of God, I did not

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:41.305
talk of bhoots, I did not talk of any religion.

00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:44.875
I just talked about Self-Realization.

00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:52.215
The reason was, I thought, if you get your
Self-Realization then you'll understand the

00:15:52.215 --> 00:16:05.725
rest of it, but no use talking to you -

00:16:05.725 --> 00:16:15.405
about God or about Divine because first thing
is you must have your eyes, you must have

00:16:15.405 --> 00:16:19.855
the light, otherwise what's the use of talking
about these things.

00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:25.175
But it so happened that Buddha did not give
anybody Realization.

00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:32.195
So it was all right for Him to talk about
the Spirit and not about God or any religion,

00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:38.405
to such an extent that people say that Buddha
was an atheist - He did not believe in God.

00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:47.275
No, it was a matter of His policy that He
did not want to talk about God.

00:16:47.275 --> 00:16:56.895
But what I found when I came to America that
this world is full of all kinds of things.

00:16:56.895 --> 00:17:01.895
Firstly the tremendous ego that they have.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:06.085
And secondly they are so much conditioned.

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:17.605
There were so many witchcrafts and forces,
I mean openly they are saying, "This is a

00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:18.805
witchcraft's school."

00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:19.805
Openly.

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:23.625
Or, "This is a satanic powers school."

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:27.375
All kinds, I was surprised, openly saying
like that.

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:34.715
And when I came to San Diego first, because
I came on My own, and the people who invited

00:17:34.715 --> 00:17:41.825
Me had an organization called "parapsychology"
- is all bhoots.

00:17:41.825 --> 00:17:48.965
So they took Me round in a huge, big hall
and there were lots of people sitting down

00:17:48.965 --> 00:17:51.485
and I saw all the bhoots.

00:17:51.485 --> 00:17:54.355
(Shri Mataji laughing) I said, "Now what should
I do?

00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:55.355
Should I say the truth or not?

00:17:55.355 --> 00:17:58.375
They might start getting angry with Me."

00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:05.135
But I said, "Better to tell them, because
once they are lost in the bhoots, then what

00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:06.875
will I do with them?"

00:18:06.875 --> 00:18:10.285
So I told them, "This is all wrong, this is
all bhootish, it is all nonsense, you just

00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:18.175
don't fall a prey to all these things, this
is not correct, you better get your Realization!"

00:18:18.175 --> 00:18:23.435
And see, some people did get Realization,
and some people did leave that organization.

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:35.375
Now, last time when I came I discovered in
'83 that the lady who was in charge sort of

00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:46.855
a person, has become mad and the gentleman
who was organizing all that has become bankrupt

00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:51.154
and has gone to Australia and the building
has collapsed.

00:18:51.355 --> 00:18:55.235
The bhoots must have done the job.

00:18:55.235 --> 00:19:04.925
It was such a problem for Me in those days
to talk against all this nonsense.

00:19:04.925 --> 00:19:05.925
Then I went to some churches, they invited
Me.

00:19:05.925 --> 00:19:13.055
Now, in the church suddenly I found eight
or ten bhootish people got up and started

00:19:13.055 --> 00:19:14.055
dancing.

00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:16.915
I said, "Where am I now?"

00:19:16.915 --> 00:19:24.595
(Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter) I am here to
tell them about the Spirit and see the condition

00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:25.595
here.

00:19:25.595 --> 00:19:32.395
What am I to tell them and they ardently
believed that I was an agent of God, of course,

00:19:32.395 --> 00:19:34.655
but God meaning bhoot.

00:19:34.655 --> 00:19:42.135
It was impossible to understand how far people
have gone.

00:19:42.135 --> 00:19:50.175
At the same time there was an onslaught of
all the fake gurus at that time and when I

00:19:50.175 --> 00:19:55.635
said, "You cannot pay for it" they said, "You
better go back.

00:19:55.635 --> 00:19:57.455
We don't want you."

00:19:57.455 --> 00:20:04.205
So I went away and then came back after nine
years.

00:20:04.205 --> 00:20:14.045
So Buddha tried to talk only about Self-Realization
and not about God at all.

00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:23.375
But His followers as they are always one better
than the other, tried to create a Buddhism

00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:27.595
of their own style.

00:20:27.796 --> 00:20:32.064
And in this Buddhism, whatever He had told,
they did not observe it.

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:38.355
Firstly He thought if there is ritualism and
puja an all that, before Realization where

00:20:38.355 --> 00:20:41.815
will they land up?

00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:49.495
So He said, "All right, you do not do any
puja to Me!

00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:52.894
Do not built any monument in My name!

00:20:52.894 --> 00:20:57.725
You should not worship anything!"

00:20:57.725 --> 00:20:59.025
So what did they do?

00:20:59.025 --> 00:21:06.555
They are worshipping His teeth, they are worshipping
His nails, they are worshipping His hair.

00:21:06.555 --> 00:21:17.945
Now say, for example, if you get My hair and
you are not a Realized Soul, what is the difference

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:20.145
between My hair or anybody's hair?

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:22.835
Just the same.

00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:29.165
Without Realization all this worship took
them to very bhootish area.

00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:35.285
That's how we find the Buddhists who are nowhere
near Buddha.

00:21:35.285 --> 00:21:40.965
Like if you go to Japan, you can't believe
they can be Buddhist.

00:21:40.965 --> 00:21:46.315
They are supposed to be Buddhist - Buddha
who is the compassionate.

00:21:46.315 --> 00:21:53.565
Then we have got Chinese who followed Buddhism.

00:21:53.565 --> 00:21:56.865
They couldn't understand Buddhism either.

00:21:56.865 --> 00:22:04.525
And we have Tibetans where we had these horrible
lamas and we had other people in Ladakh and

00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:05.525
all that.

00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:12.275
They are all doing nothing else but bhoot-vidya,
prita-vidya, smashaan vidya.

00:22:12.275 --> 00:22:18.105
So even His advent amounted to the same thing
as everybody's.

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:28.485
Now Buddha told three things which are very
important, which are very useful for Sahaja

00:22:28.485 --> 00:22:31.095
Yogis to follow.

00:22:31.095 --> 00:22:39.975
He said, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami.

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:46.135
- I surrender myself to the enlightened one."

00:22:46.135 --> 00:22:47.205
Means what?

00:22:47.205 --> 00:22:52.115
I surrender myself to the one who is enlightened.

00:22:52.115 --> 00:22:55.805
In this case one can say it was Buddha.

00:22:55.805 --> 00:22:59.565
In your case it is your Spirit.

00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:03.755
You surrender yourself to your Spirit.

00:23:03.755 --> 00:23:05.475
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:23:05.475 --> 00:23:09.985
Buddha means the one which knows.

00:23:09.985 --> 00:23:19.235
Then He says another thing, "Dhammam Sharanam
Gachami" means surrender yourself to the religion,

00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:23.325
which is true religion, which is the balance.

00:23:23.325 --> 00:23:33.035
Now as you see, all these man-made religions
are so funny and you can't make much out of

00:23:33.035 --> 00:23:34.035
them.

00:23:34.035 --> 00:23:40.195
You can't explain if these are religions or these
are Mafias.

00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:51.905
The reason is, Buddha said, "You surrender
yourselves to Dharma."

00:23:51.905 --> 00:23:58.255
So the Buddhist thought, "surrender to Dharma"
means what you have to do is to become like

00:23:58.255 --> 00:24:06.005
Buddhist - means wear a dress like a Buddhist,
like Buddha used to wear.

00:24:06.005 --> 00:24:11.695
You don't become by wearing that dress Buddha,
do you?

00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:14.265
Or then they thought, "We should do something
more."

00:24:14.265 --> 00:24:24.175
So some Buddhist got hold of a wheel, because
He talked of a wheel-of-life and all that.

00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:31.754
Absolutely, I should say, very unintelligent
way of understanding Buddha.

00:24:31.754 --> 00:24:35.815
And they would go on, you see, moving that
wheel like mad.

00:24:35.815 --> 00:24:38.305
You can't talk to them.

00:24:38.305 --> 00:24:41.225
You say, "Now, where is that road?"

00:24:41.225 --> 00:24:42.225
"Buddha."

00:24:42.225 --> 00:24:45.715
(Laughter) "How do we go there?"

00:24:45.715 --> 00:24:48.925
(Laughter) Everything has an answer.

00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:52.775
So I said, "Please answer Me."

00:24:52.775 --> 00:24:55.345
"This is the answer."

00:24:55.345 --> 00:25:02.435
So what is this answer going on?

00:25:02.435 --> 00:25:07.205
Then these people thought we should find out
new methods.

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:16.495
So some of them took to again Upanishadas
and started using also from there, making

00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:25.255
jataka kathas like the stories which are very
absurd, funny stories, mysterious stories,

00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:28.495
this story, that story.

00:25:28.495 --> 00:25:41.365
At the same time Hinduism took another funny
role and they had a big assault of tantrikas.

00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:51.815
And when the tantrikas came in they brought
all kinds of ugly, horrible things in the

00:25:51.815 --> 00:25:58.995
- say about the sixth century it started.

00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:11.585
And a complete belt starting beyond Calcutta
going towards Dwarika, complete belt got involved

00:26:11.585 --> 00:26:13.625
into tantrism.

00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:19.335
So the same Buddhist later on, followed the
same tantric methods.

00:26:19.335 --> 00:26:27.235
So they tried to bring in everything from
this place, that place and a mixture, so now

00:26:27.235 --> 00:26:33.965
if you ask, "Now what's your religion?" they
say, "I'm Buddhist."

00:26:33.965 --> 00:26:35.185
"What Buddhist?"

00:26:35.185 --> 00:26:37.015
- "Dinayan, hinayan,

00:26:37.015 --> 00:26:42.515
I'm Zen - this, that, all kinds of Buddhism is
there.

00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:47.935
Is impossible to understand really where is
Buddhism there.

00:26:47.935 --> 00:26:49.045
So what do these do?

00:26:49.045 --> 00:26:51.105
One will shave their hair.

00:26:51.105 --> 00:26:53.165
One will shave their moustache.

00:26:53.165 --> 00:26:55.555
Another one will wear this kind of a dress.

00:26:55.555 --> 00:26:59.845
(Shri Mataji laughing) This is the only difference
between from one to another.

00:26:59.845 --> 00:27:06.645
But the common point is that they are all
cheats, they all can deceive you, they can

00:27:06.645 --> 00:27:08.645
tell lies without feeling funny.

00:27:08.645 --> 00:27:12.865
They are very sly, very cunning and suicidal.

00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:22.025
They can be very violent and the only desire
they have is to kill everybody who comes across.

00:27:22.025 --> 00:27:29.895
This is where Buddha's Buddhism has ended
up.

00:27:29.895 --> 00:27:35.745
So now we are face to face with Buddha.

00:27:35.745 --> 00:27:42.695
But what He talked about was a spontaneous
happening of Self-Realization.

00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:45.655
And He said, "You prepare yourself."

00:27:45.655 --> 00:27:52.274
All the time He said, "You prepare yourself
for Self-Realization and try to watch everything

00:27:52.274 --> 00:27:53.274
without desire."

00:27:53.274 --> 00:27:58.445
This was just preparation for Sahaja Yoga
He was talking about.

00:27:58.445 --> 00:28:13.195
But as you see, all the Buddhists today, if
you see them you'll be amazed that they are

00:28:13.195 --> 00:28:14.835
neither here nor there.

00:28:14.835 --> 00:28:20.285
You just don't know how to place them, how
to understand them, how to make them feel

00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:22.965
what Buddha taught or Zen has taught.

00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:27.355
They are not in a condition to understand
anything.

00:28:27.355 --> 00:28:36.905
It's like, you see, the brain of a person
who is having all kinds of thoughts, like

00:28:36.905 --> 00:28:41.745
all the pebbles in one little pot, making
noise.

00:28:41.745 --> 00:28:45.485
God knows which one is making which noise.

00:28:45.485 --> 00:28:52.215
And that's why today you find here is one
Lama, who was a guru of Hitler.

00:28:52.215 --> 00:28:55.705
Imagine: Hitler's guru was Lama!

00:28:55.705 --> 00:29:01.315
Now this mister Lama is going round the whole
world with his wrinkles which can be counted

00:29:01.315 --> 00:29:04.935
one by one and asking for money.

00:29:04.935 --> 00:29:06.485
Why does he want money for?

00:29:06.485 --> 00:29:16.595
He is the one who ran away from Tibet, from
Lhasa.

00:29:16.595 --> 00:29:20.805
And while running away he carried such a lot
of gold with him that he could not carry.

00:29:20.805 --> 00:29:25.945
So half of it he dropped it in the river and
with the half of it he reached India.

00:29:25.945 --> 00:29:32.455
With the half of it already he has made a
huge, big Buddha of gold, he has too much

00:29:32.455 --> 00:29:33.655
gold with him.

00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:43.185
And the rest of the gold that was salvaged,
was taken to Russia - to China, where I've

00:29:43.185 --> 00:29:44.815
seen it Myself.

00:29:44.815 --> 00:29:45.815
Amazed.

00:29:46.016 --> 00:29:53.534
He had gold, beer mugs, what you call
them, the huge, big things, like that.

00:29:53.735 --> 00:29:54.895
Real gold.

00:29:54.895 --> 00:29:59.905
And such big plates of real gold for eating
food.

00:29:59.905 --> 00:30:00.905
Imagine!

00:30:00.905 --> 00:30:09.955
Buddha talked of detachment, and they had
everything in gold or silver of a very expensive

00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:11.675
quality.

00:30:11.675 --> 00:30:15.145
If you see their robe, clothes and all that
you'd be amazed.

00:30:15.145 --> 00:30:23.465
Though they wore all those things as robes
of renunciation, but whenever they sat in

00:30:23.264 --> 00:30:31.744
their own courtyard - courts and things like
that, inside all that they wore - inside wore

00:30:31.945 --> 00:30:40.135
all those dresses which were very heavily
done with real gold, with pearls and things,

00:30:40.135 --> 00:30:45.615
because I've seen with My own eyes.

00:30:45.615 --> 00:30:48.765
I was amazed.

00:30:48.765 --> 00:30:52.585
So it is like somebody who says, "Oh, I must
get detached.

00:30:52.585 --> 00:30:54.445
Now I'm going to the seashore.

00:30:54.445 --> 00:30:57.685
I'm going to sit there and meditate."

00:30:57.685 --> 00:31:01.105
There he goes, and makes a compound round
himself.

00:31:01.105 --> 00:31:05.765
So I ask him, "Why have you made a compound?", "You
know, maybe thieves might come in."

00:31:05.765 --> 00:31:10.445
I mean you are detached what does it matter
if a thief comes, he will take you away, so

00:31:10.445 --> 00:31:11.445
what?

00:31:11.445 --> 00:31:14.825
You are there, doesn't matter, you can go
with a thief, you can go with anyone.

00:31:14.825 --> 00:31:16.585
Why are you worried about the thief?

00:31:16.585 --> 00:31:17.895
You are detached.

00:31:17.895 --> 00:31:21.595
"Oh, you see, I am also worried that there
might be pick-pockets."

00:31:21.595 --> 00:31:25.145
"So why are you worried about pick-pockets?"

00:31:25.145 --> 00:31:31.925
"Because maybe I have some money with me here,
and I have my bank account and I have my other, other

00:31:31.724 --> 00:31:36.264
things with me, so I am rather worried, see,
that a thief might come."

00:31:36.465 --> 00:31:39.535
So why do you talk of detachment?

00:31:39.535 --> 00:31:41.835
Why do you talk of sanyasa?

00:31:41.835 --> 00:31:51.795
So this kind of a nonsensical sanyasa started
after Buddha died, which was so very shocking.

00:31:51.795 --> 00:32:00.795
This led people to think that you can wear
any time an orange dress and then you are

00:32:00.795 --> 00:32:01.795
a sanyasi.

00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:06.155
If you wear an orange dress you become Buddha,
and you become a detached personality.

00:32:06.155 --> 00:32:13.455
Now you can announce to the whole world that,
"I'm a detached personality" and what is your

00:32:13.455 --> 00:32:14.455
background?

00:32:14.455 --> 00:32:19.894
"Nothing, I just was born out of this Mother
Earth and I'm sitting here nicely like Buddha."

00:32:19.894 --> 00:32:23.655
So people stupidly start giving them money.

00:32:23.655 --> 00:32:26.024
So they get the money.

00:32:26.024 --> 00:32:31.285
But actually, the background is that the fellow
might have come out of the jail in India for

00:32:31.285 --> 00:32:38.115
burglary or something like that, and now sitting
down here as Buddha.

00:32:38.115 --> 00:32:40.475
How will you make out?

00:32:40.475 --> 00:32:45.755
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:51.785
So what we have to do is to establish ourselves
in Buddha.

00:32:51.785 --> 00:32:56.465
That is to establish within ourselves in our
Spirit.

00:32:56.465 --> 00:33:05.175
Unless and until we are established in our
Spirit, we cannot understand the intricacies

00:33:05.175 --> 00:33:11.015
of all the ignorance that we have around.

00:33:11.015 --> 00:33:17.745
So the best way to understand Sahaja Yoga
is to establish yourself in the Spirit.

00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:26.505
But those who are not intelligent, those who
are stupid, those who are selfish and greedy

00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:30.005
do not see this point.

00:33:30.005 --> 00:33:37.325
And they do not like it if a leader tells
them that, "You must establish in Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:37.325 --> 00:33:40.465
that you should have your Spirit manifested."

00:33:40.465 --> 00:33:42.485
They don't want to listen to it.

00:33:42.485 --> 00:33:48.405
They want to be in the group of Sahaja Yogis
because they don't want to be lonely.

00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:57.165
They would like to sing songs, music, everything
in Sahaja Yoga because they want somewhere

00:33:57.165 --> 00:34:03.365
to fit in, because they want an identity,
they call themselves Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:03.365 --> 00:34:08.415
But this identity is a false identity.

00:34:08.415 --> 00:34:13.165
You have to be identified with your Spirit.

00:34:13.165 --> 00:34:17.795
That is the part is, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:34:17.795 --> 00:34:22.275
The second is, "Dhammam Sharanam Gachami."

00:34:22.275 --> 00:34:24.545
What is "Dhammam", is Dharma.

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:28.915
What is our Dharma, is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:34:28.915 --> 00:34:32.774
That means now we have become universal beings.

00:34:32.774 --> 00:34:42.345
We are no more Indians, no more Africans,
no more English, no more French.

00:34:42.345 --> 00:34:57.175
We all have become now Sahaja Yogis who are
the citizens of the Kingdom of God.

00:34:57.175 --> 00:35:00.385
We have no other identification.

00:35:00.385 --> 00:35:02.995
This is our Dharma.

00:35:02.995 --> 00:35:10.135
We are now leading a universal life.

00:35:10.135 --> 00:35:17.285
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

00:35:17.285 --> 00:35:24.355
Still, so many of them still identify themselves
with some localized stuff.

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:33.845
Now when we think of universality we have
to understand, that it's not only the religion

00:35:33.845 --> 00:35:40.265
or a country that separates us, but also a
kind of a quality.

00:35:40.265 --> 00:35:47.565
For example, if there are people who are Rajo-gunis
who are very active, right-sided people, they'll

00:35:47.565 --> 00:35:48.805
combine together.

00:35:48.805 --> 00:35:51.405
They may fight later but they combine.

00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:59.764
Then the people who are left-sided will combine
together, but both of these should cling onto

00:35:59.563 --> 00:36:08.174
those who are trying to ascend, who are in
the center.

00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:12.035
And there where we fail very much.

00:36:12.035 --> 00:36:24.045
Our associations and our understandings of
each other is deluded by our ignorance and

00:36:24.045 --> 00:36:37.415
we cannot understand who is for our ascent
and who is for our benevolence.

00:36:37.415 --> 00:36:41.235
This happens with us in so many ways.

00:36:41.235 --> 00:36:47.785
We are universal beings and our culture is
"Sahaja Culture."

00:36:47.785 --> 00:36:50.905
We have given up all our nonsensical cultures.

00:36:50.905 --> 00:36:58.865
In every religion, in every country we have
seen the nonsense of our culture, so we believe

00:36:58.865 --> 00:37:03.144
in the spontaneous culture of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:03.144 --> 00:37:06.075
So we are universal beings.

00:37:06.075 --> 00:37:15.325
And in this state of being universal being
you have to develop your collective consciousness.

00:37:15.325 --> 00:37:27.205
As first one is for individual, "Buddham Sharanam
Gacchami" - I surrender myself to Buddha.

00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:34.515
The second one is the one, I surrender myself
to the collective - in the sense, into the

00:37:34.515 --> 00:37:38.075
Dharma, the essence of the collective.

00:37:38.075 --> 00:37:41.245
Now what is the essence of our collective?

00:37:41.245 --> 00:37:48.215
What binds us together is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,
the Pure Religion of the Universe.

00:37:48.215 --> 00:37:56.334
So once you understand that this is the thing
that binds you to each other, you must understand

00:37:56.334 --> 00:38:01.535
how important it is to keep to Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma.

00:38:01.535 --> 00:38:09.325
In so many ways I have been able to tell you
what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:38:09.325 --> 00:38:20.624
So we have to understand the full content
of the Dharma that we are following and also

00:38:20.624 --> 00:38:27.315
to reflect it back to see, "Are we really
following this religion?"

00:38:27.315 --> 00:38:31.305
But in falsehood I have seen like somebody's
a Christian.

00:38:31.305 --> 00:38:37.865
Every Sunday he'll get up, dress up nicely,
go to the church, get up three times, four

00:38:37.865 --> 00:38:43.185
times, sing songs, this thing, do everything,
pay the money to the priest, pay to the church,

00:38:43.185 --> 00:38:51.645
pay to that, and then he thinks he has done
the job.

00:38:51.645 --> 00:38:54.685
Very religiously he'll go and confess.

00:38:54.685 --> 00:38:59.855
Muslims, very religiously will do some things
which we cannot really understand.

00:38:59.855 --> 00:39:07.375
As in Spain I was told that people try
to crucify themselves, as a drama of course,

00:39:07.375 --> 00:39:16.105
but they do it just to protect Christianity
I think, and to crucify - God knows what!

00:39:16.105 --> 00:39:23.925
Then there are people in India who are following
Hinduism and the first principle, the basic

00:39:23.925 --> 00:39:28.125
principle of Hinduism, that there is Spirit
in everyone.

00:39:28.125 --> 00:39:33.105
So how can you have caste and subcaste and this and that?

00:39:33.105 --> 00:39:36.975
If everybody has the Spirit you can't have
caste, subcaste.

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:40.825
You cannot have division like that.

00:39:40.825 --> 00:39:47.865
So what we find in every religion, there are
problematic things but once you come to this

00:39:47.865 --> 00:39:54.584
pure religion, then you see the essence of
it and the essence of it is that, that we

00:39:54.584 --> 00:40:01.455
are all Spirit and we are all related to each
other, we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:40:01.455 --> 00:40:03.315
So you go to the collective.

00:40:03.315 --> 00:40:07.825
So at the end He said, "Sangham Sharanam Gachami."

00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:11.595
This is the very important point also.

00:40:11.595 --> 00:40:19.985
It's the most important thing is this "Sangham
Sharanam Gachami."

00:40:19.985 --> 00:40:27.415
For example, we say that you surrender yourself
to collectivity.

00:40:27.415 --> 00:40:28.435
What does that mean?

00:40:28.435 --> 00:40:29.895
What does that entail (it is)?

00:40:29.895 --> 00:40:40.445
As I was talking to your leaders here, I said,
"All of you should form one collective unit,

00:40:40.445 --> 00:40:42.155
a 'Sangham'."

00:40:42.155 --> 00:40:49.235
All the leaders have to know that they love
Mother from their heart, and they should never

00:40:49.235 --> 00:41:00.625
try to cut each other because somebody's trying
to tell them against them.

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.617
They should have love for each other.

00:41:03.617 --> 00:41:05.505
For example there's one Mr. X, who's a leader.

00:41:05.505 --> 00:41:14.635
Now a negative force incarnates and comes
and tells the leader that, "See the other

00:41:14.635 --> 00:41:15.885
leader is my supporter."

00:41:15.885 --> 00:41:22.725
So this fellow has a bad feeling, the another
leader has another bad feeling.

00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:24.435
This is going against "Sangha."

00:41:24.435 --> 00:41:31.485
First the Sangha of the collectivity of the
leaders has to be fully appreciated.

00:41:31.485 --> 00:41:36.605
I enjoy the way when all these leaders meet
and beat each other nicely and enjoy each

00:41:36.605 --> 00:41:45.525
other, pull each other's legs and love each
other and patronize the younger ones and look

00:41:45.525 --> 00:41:46.525
after.

00:41:46.525 --> 00:41:47.685
That's the beginning of Sangha.

00:41:47.685 --> 00:41:52.845
If the leaders are not in Sangha, what other
Sangha we can form?

00:41:52.845 --> 00:41:56.205
So the first is the Sangha of the leaders
is there.

00:41:56.205 --> 00:42:02.325
All those who try to break that Sangha must
know that they are negative people and they

00:42:02.124 --> 00:42:04.884
are going to stab us.

00:42:05.085 --> 00:42:09.475
Anybody who tries that, you should be very
careful.

00:42:09.475 --> 00:42:14.705
The second Sangha, collectivity, is among
the Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:14.705 --> 00:42:23.505
Now we are not, as I told you, Indians, or
we are not English or Americans or anything,

00:42:23.505 --> 00:42:25.995
so we should not form groups.

00:42:25.995 --> 00:42:32.445
What you'll find always, if there are five
Americans they'll stick on to each other as

00:42:32.244 --> 00:42:36.214
if they have been glued, and they can't move
away from each other.

00:42:36.415 --> 00:42:37.805
All of them will be together.

00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:42.584
If there are Indians, they will stick on together.

00:42:42.584 --> 00:42:47.905
If there are other kinds, they'll all stick
on together.

00:42:47.905 --> 00:42:50.675
Now we are no more that.

00:42:50.675 --> 00:42:52.074
It's finished!

00:42:52.074 --> 00:42:54.295
So what is there to glue to each other?

00:42:54.295 --> 00:42:55.645
But it happens.

00:42:55.645 --> 00:42:58.125
We always glue to each other.

00:42:58.125 --> 00:43:00.515
I don't know why.

00:43:00.515 --> 00:43:02.345
What is the need to do that?

00:43:02.345 --> 00:43:09.835
And very commonly we see that in India people
are behaving in a very funny manner.

00:43:09.835 --> 00:43:15.945
Last year I did not know, but people told
Me that some group came and they were all

00:43:15.945 --> 00:43:23.605
the time saying, "We are a great nation, we
are a great nation."

00:43:23.605 --> 00:43:27.555
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:27.555 --> 00:43:38.275
Our nation is Kingdom of God and our King
is God Almighty and we have no other King

00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:40.945
and no other nation.

00:43:40.945 --> 00:43:51.605
If you cannot transcend those barriers of
stupid limitations you cannot become Sahaja

00:43:51.605 --> 00:43:52.805
Yogis.

00:43:52.805 --> 00:43:55.935
But this is in a very gross way.

00:43:55.935 --> 00:44:05.915
But in a very subtle way, I see a lady who
is catching or who has badha will immediately

00:44:05.915 --> 00:44:08.045
crawl into another one - somehow.

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:11.475
She may belong to any country, doesn't matter.

00:44:11.475 --> 00:44:21.335
You see, a bhootish woman, say, coming from
India, will crawl up to another one in Australia.

00:44:21.134 --> 00:44:22.874
Straight forward, march!

00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:26.575
Just start watching, "Where is she going?

00:44:26.575 --> 00:44:28.925
Oh God, that's it!"

00:44:28.925 --> 00:44:35.405
So the bhoots are very collective, a big fraternity,
great fraternity.

00:44:35.405 --> 00:44:41.105
If they see somebody who is possessed, this
bhootish person will immediately go to her.

00:44:41.105 --> 00:44:48.285
It is very surprising that the bhoots are
so collective.

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:52.485
Apart from that, they know Me very well.

00:44:52.485 --> 00:44:54.425
They understand Me very well.

00:44:54.425 --> 00:45:01.405
Even a little child if he is caught up will
start crying before Me, shaking before Me,

00:45:01.405 --> 00:45:03.195
not coming before Me.

00:45:03.195 --> 00:45:10.035
But when they are realized, they don't understand
and moreover they don't understand a simple

00:45:10.035 --> 00:45:15.445
principle that we are now possessed by our
own Spirit and we are one.

00:45:15.445 --> 00:45:26.685
So they should stick on more to the person
who is a spiritually evolved personality.

00:45:26.685 --> 00:45:34.705
But instead of that, for them some "third-rater"
something is much more important than a person

00:45:34.705 --> 00:45:38.695
who is such a highly developed person.

00:45:38.695 --> 00:45:41.545
This is where we fail in our collective.

00:45:41.545 --> 00:45:46.834
A very subtle method of these negative people.

00:45:46.834 --> 00:45:51.375
Just finding out how to form a big formidable
group to attack.

00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:56.935
With that you lose your vibrations.

00:45:56.935 --> 00:46:04.275
Once you lose your vibrations then you say,
"Oh, this is too much.

00:46:04.275 --> 00:46:06.195
We must have compassion.

00:46:06.195 --> 00:46:08.165
We must have love.

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:12.015
After all we are all Sahaja Yogis."

00:46:12.015 --> 00:46:17.415
So it's the compassion and love of bhoots
among themselves.

00:46:17.415 --> 00:46:22.145
They are talking of compassion to each other.

00:46:22.145 --> 00:46:27.875
Even with Me they said, "Mother, you have
to be kind."

00:46:27.875 --> 00:46:35.215
I said, "Are you more compassionate than Me
that you are teaching Me?"

00:46:35.215 --> 00:46:45.045
If I'm saying anything to this lady taking
all My breath and all My energy on her, then

00:46:44.844 --> 00:46:49.874
I'm doing it for her benevolence and it's
My compassion that is [why/working], but what you

00:46:50.075 --> 00:46:58.285
are doing is not for the benevolence but for
the destruction of that person.

00:46:58.285 --> 00:47:04.385
So no use supporting someone who is negative.

00:47:04.385 --> 00:47:09.685
Many negative persons who have been asked
to get out of Sahaja Yoga sometimes create

00:47:09.685 --> 00:47:16.645
this problem of coming, "Oh Mother, you know,
I'm so good, but they tortured me, they troubled

00:47:16.645 --> 00:47:17.795
me so much."

00:47:17.795 --> 00:47:19.785
Now I'm seeing a bhoot in the person.

00:47:19.785 --> 00:47:22.105
I can clearly see.

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:29.025
I can see the negativity, but if you do not
see, you will immediately start taking sides,

00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:33.965
"Oh God, look at this, poor thing is tortured."

00:47:33.965 --> 00:47:39.785
You lose your vibrations, you won't be able
to find out!

00:47:39.785 --> 00:47:44.675
So don't come under the spell of these murmuring
souls, as Christ has called.

00:47:44.675 --> 00:47:49.825
He said, "Murmuring souls are the greatest
danger."

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.735
That I've seen in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:51.735 --> 00:48:00.095
Those who murmur, talk at the back, go on
complaining are the greatest danger to Sahaja

00:48:00.095 --> 00:48:03.075
Yoga and ultimately to themselves.

00:48:03.075 --> 00:48:06.064
Because they'll be found out.

00:48:06.064 --> 00:48:15.625
So this is the another situation into which
we are not collective and when we are collective,

00:48:15.625 --> 00:48:23.965
we are collective for something which is not
ascending force.

00:48:23.965 --> 00:48:37.205
It is something surprising how we see people
in this world are inviting their destruction

00:48:37.205 --> 00:48:47.215
and we too, in a way, when we don't understand
what is collectivity, try to destroy our body

00:48:47.215 --> 00:48:52.025
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:52.025 --> 00:48:59.065
Today I'm telling you this because all these
things must be stopped now on the day of Buddha's

00:48:59.065 --> 00:49:00.334
birth.

00:49:00.334 --> 00:49:06.905
Buddha is the one who is in charge of your
ego.

00:49:06.905 --> 00:49:15.225
If you go beyond Buddha and start showing
off too much, then He pushes your ego into

00:49:15.225 --> 00:49:16.855
your left Vishuddhi.

00:49:16.855 --> 00:49:22.535
So you develop your left Vishuddhi and when
you develop your left Vishuddhi, what happens?

00:49:22.535 --> 00:49:28.135
That you start feeling guilty, meaning you
do not want to face the situation at all,

00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:31.045
but you say "Oh, I'm very guilty.

00:49:31.045 --> 00:49:35.605
I've killed you, all right, I've killed you,
I'm feeling guilty."

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:38.235
We never face the situation.

00:49:38.235 --> 00:49:44.145
This is the ego which goes into the left and
creates this problem of left Vishuddhi.

00:49:44.145 --> 00:49:51.495
It's not by any chance your style of bearing
up things, or you are being suppressed.

00:49:51.495 --> 00:50:02.535
But no, you have been oppressing others, you
have been egoistical and it has been so much

00:50:02.535 --> 00:50:10.895
that it has gone into the left Vishuddhi.

00:50:10.895 --> 00:50:13.005
So you are trying to justify.

00:50:13.005 --> 00:50:21.035
Now I would suggest that if you really want
to understand Sahaja Yoga, first try to understand

00:50:21.035 --> 00:50:22.605
yourself.

00:50:22.605 --> 00:50:29.105
Then you see, "Where is my mind going now?"

00:50:29.105 --> 00:50:33.814
Some ladies who are used to, say gossip, they
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:33.814 --> 00:50:40.745
They are all right, but sometimes that thing
comes, "Let's go and gossip about this lady".

00:50:40.544 --> 00:50:46.904
They'll just get up, walk on to another one who
must have been gossiped in last life, maybe.

00:50:47.105 --> 00:50:52.575
So go and talk to that person and tell something
against that person.

00:50:52.575 --> 00:51:00.595
(Shri Mataji laughing) Then they find out
another gossiper or they get another gossiper.

00:51:00.595 --> 00:51:05.195
Now, what I find is three great Sahaja Yoginis
are sitting and gossiping there.

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:06.195
I say, "What are you talking?"

00:51:06.195 --> 00:51:11.295
"Oh, no Mother, we were discussing Sahaja
Yoga."

00:51:11.295 --> 00:51:13.225
I said, "Really?"

00:51:13.225 --> 00:51:23.415
(Laughter) Discussing Sahaja Yogis is never
discussion on Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:23.415 --> 00:51:29.205
If you are discussing people you are not discussing
Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:29.205 --> 00:51:37.375
Discussing Sahaja Yoga has nothing to do with
human beings or with Realized souls.

00:51:37.375 --> 00:51:46.064
Thank God, you don't discuss Me, because I
must be making lots of mistakes.

00:51:46.064 --> 00:51:52.625
In relation to your culture, in relation to
your styles, in relation to the human style.

00:51:52.625 --> 00:51:56.035
For example, you have to say, "Thank you"
ten times.

00:51:56.035 --> 00:51:59.795
I might be saying it only three times or four
times.

00:51:59.795 --> 00:52:02.525
Or you have to say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry."

00:52:02.525 --> 00:52:07.625
On the telephone even now, I never say sorry,
I say, "I beg your pardon?"

00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:10.915
But you see, people will say, "Sorry, sorry,
sorry."

00:52:10.915 --> 00:52:16.585
I start thinking, "Am I in the wrong or they
are in the wrong?"

00:52:16.585 --> 00:52:17.585
(Laughter)

00:52:17.585 --> 00:52:31.395
So when we start discussing others, what we
really do is to confront or to face someone

00:52:31.395 --> 00:52:33.455
with your own limitations.

00:52:33.455 --> 00:52:41.655
And we start thinking, "He should have done
like this, he should have ..." What about

00:52:41.655 --> 00:52:42.655
you?

00:52:42.655 --> 00:52:51.375
So best is, you discuss yourself with yourself
and you discuss Sahaja Yoga with others.

00:52:51.375 --> 00:52:56.495
This is the best way to get rid of one of
the greatest enemies of collectivity, is gossip.

00:52:56.495 --> 00:53:03.725
Is a human nature, you know, I think, to gossip.

00:53:03.725 --> 00:53:14.125
Another horrible thing we have, which Buddha
has tried to control, is a very subtle type

00:53:14.125 --> 00:53:16.494
of aggressiveness.

00:53:16.494 --> 00:53:21.725
That one of the games I play is of making
somebody a leader.

00:53:21.725 --> 00:53:23.485
It's a game, please remember.

00:53:23.485 --> 00:53:26.615
Even if I tell you, "I'm Mahamaya", you forget
it.

00:53:26.615 --> 00:53:31.375
Even if I tell you, "I'm playing a game",
still you forget it.

00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.855
You become so seriously leaders, you see.

00:53:33.855 --> 00:53:37.715
It's nothing to feel that you are leaders,
there's nothing like leaders, there's nothing

00:53:37.715 --> 00:53:40.165
like that in Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:40.165 --> 00:53:43.445
But then I praise some.

00:53:43.445 --> 00:53:49.525
Now I had a mind to praise people today for
yesterday's program.

00:53:49.525 --> 00:53:55.185
The way it was arranged, the way it was done
beautifully, so many people came, is remarkable.

00:53:55.185 --> 00:53:59.815
But then I was thinking, "Should I say or
not?"

00:53:59.815 --> 00:54:08.495
(Laughter) If I say, next time, God knows
what I will see.

00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:16.615
(Laughter) So encouraging like this, will
it help or not?

00:54:16.615 --> 00:54:19.585
So I've been still discreet about it.

00:54:19.585 --> 00:54:26.064
Of course, I must say, yesterday's program
was very remarkable and we must really give

00:54:26.064 --> 00:54:35.345
a hand to Dave and to the leader, our Karan.

00:54:35.345 --> 00:54:37.275
(Applause)

00:54:37.275 --> 00:54:56.395
Despite all stupid opposition and nonsense,
they have shown how they have brought in so

00:54:56.395 --> 00:55:03.565
many people to Sahaja Yoga and how with complete
concentration they have been able to establish

00:55:03.565 --> 00:55:09.834
so many in Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:09.834 --> 00:55:18.315
So it is for you to learn from it, that despite
all problems and anything, without feeling

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:28.155
bad about it, just see that you move like
a big elephant towards giving Realization

00:55:28.155 --> 00:55:38.855
to others, creating more Sahaja Yogis and
more Sahaja Yogis in America.

00:55:38.855 --> 00:55:46.084
Those who had this aim in life that we have
to give Realization to people, we have to

00:55:46.084 --> 00:55:56.595
achieve establishment of Sahaja Yoga, they
never will have any problems of any kind.

00:55:56.595 --> 00:56:03.955
So never bring down yourself to the level
where you think that, "See, the food was not

00:56:03.955 --> 00:56:10.385
good, that was not good, this one was not
good, this fellow was torturing, that fellow

00:56:10.184 --> 00:56:12.014
was doing this."

00:56:12.215 --> 00:56:13.215
Nothing.

00:56:13.215 --> 00:56:15.885
This is not going to help you, help anyone.

00:56:15.885 --> 00:56:20.375
Not going to give you any marks, as they say.

00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:25.895
After all if you have to enter into the Kingdom
of God, one has to know that you have to have

00:56:25.895 --> 00:56:26.905
certain marks.

00:56:26.905 --> 00:56:33.495
Otherwise God will say, "You failed", (Laughter)
and you'll be surprised why the entrance is

00:56:33.495 --> 00:56:34.775
not allowed.

00:56:34.775 --> 00:56:41.115
You are thinking you are so intelligent, so
great, you see, how much gossip you have created,

00:56:41.115 --> 00:56:46.035
how much problems you have created, how many
leaders you have pulled down, how much you

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:48.525
have befooled Mother and all that.

00:56:48.525 --> 00:56:52.725
(Laughter) And there suddenly you find, "I've
failed.

00:56:52.725 --> 00:56:56.145
(Laughter) What has happened?"

00:56:56.145 --> 00:56:59.535
So don't deceive your Self.

00:56:59.535 --> 00:57:02.745
Self is the Spirit.

00:57:02.745 --> 00:57:05.625
Don't deceive your Self.

00:57:05.625 --> 00:57:11.645
If you deceive yourself, ultimately you will
be deceived and despite the fact you have

00:57:11.645 --> 00:57:17.584
been Sahaja Yogis, you have been to My Puja,
you have been here and you have been certified

00:57:17.383 --> 00:57:21.794
as Sahaja Yogis, there's light on your head,
still they will say, "Take another life,

00:57:21.995 --> 00:57:23.255
and then come back.

00:57:23.255 --> 00:57:32.595
Take another as, you see, failed, you have
to go through one year more.

00:57:32.595 --> 00:57:35.395
Try another one."

00:57:35.395 --> 00:57:36.395
(Laughter)

00:57:36.395 --> 00:57:41.535
So the easiest way to be a good Sahaja Yogi,
not to deceive your Self.

00:57:41.535 --> 00:57:43.215
Watch yourself!

00:57:43.215 --> 00:57:47.925
Where is this mind going?

00:57:47.925 --> 00:57:48.925
What am I thinking?

00:57:48.925 --> 00:57:50.695
What is my mind working now?

00:57:50.695 --> 00:57:58.925
Can I, this man is coming, can I give him
Realization?

00:57:58.724 --> 00:58:00.488
Should I start talking to him about Sahaja Yoga?

00:58:00.689 --> 00:58:03.595
Sitting in the train, you watch a person.

00:58:03.595 --> 00:58:06.985
"Ah, this is all right!

00:58:06.985 --> 00:58:09.695
Let's manage this fellow."

00:58:09.695 --> 00:58:17.074
All the time you have to catch human beings
like fishes are caught.

00:58:17.074 --> 00:58:21.975
I've taught you how to do it.

00:58:21.975 --> 00:58:26.385
To go on catching them, one by one, and create
a greater collectivity.

00:58:26.385 --> 00:58:39.955
If your attention is on that, then I will
say, "You have acted like Buddha", because

00:58:39.955 --> 00:58:43.345
Buddha just did that.

00:58:43.345 --> 00:58:49.345
From everywhere He collected people, told
them to follow a path of detachment and He

00:58:49.345 --> 00:58:54.995
asked them to wear clothes and things which
are for detachment.

00:58:54.995 --> 00:59:00.725
And He asked that you should detach yourself
from your families, everything.

00:59:00.725 --> 00:59:08.085
This, all this, He did for one thing, that
they should be prepared for today's life.

00:59:08.085 --> 00:59:14.645
That they've done all these things, but we
don't want you to wear orange dresses, we

00:59:14.645 --> 00:59:23.075
don't want you to do all these wrong things,
which are not needed today.

00:59:23.075 --> 00:59:28.595
They were all right in those days, but today
they are wrong because they are not needed.

00:59:28.595 --> 00:59:35.015
When it is not needed, why should you carry
on your head?

00:59:35.015 --> 00:59:39.175
Like the other day, I saw somebody carrying
a big boat on his head.

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:40.865
I said, "What are you doing?"

00:59:40.865 --> 00:59:42.355
He said, "I'm carrying the boat."

00:59:42.355 --> 00:59:43.355
"For what?

00:59:43.355 --> 00:59:45.915
Why are you carrying the boat?"

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:52.015
Said, "You see, I know there is no need to
carry the boat here because there is no sea,

00:59:52.015 --> 00:59:54.535
no water, nothing, but I'm just carrying."

00:59:54.535 --> 01:00:01.405
(Laughter) "But why are you carrying this
load upon your head?"

01:00:01.405 --> 01:00:07.865
"Ah, because I'm carrying, you know."

01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:08.945
(Laughter)

01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:11.025
That is how we are.

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:15.064
We are carrying on with things which are not
needed.

01:00:15.064 --> 01:00:20.005
Like, "Mother, now I've been doing Hatha Yoga,
should I do some Hatha Yoga?"

01:00:20.005 --> 01:00:23.675
"But why do you want to do it?

01:00:23.675 --> 01:00:25.635
There is no need for you."

01:00:25.434 --> 01:00:30.774
"No, no, Mother, but I've been doing it."

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:34.475
(Laughter) "So do it now, what to do?"

01:00:34.475 --> 01:00:41.035
It's as stupid as this carrying a boat on
your head, that whatever is not needed unnecessarily

01:00:41.035 --> 01:00:43.475
wasting your time.

01:00:43.475 --> 01:00:51.365
"I'm used to this, Mother, I used to do this,
so I must do it."

01:00:51.365 --> 01:00:55.285
Everything is made very easy for you in Sahaja
Yoga.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.285
Very simple.

01:00:56.285 --> 01:01:01.995
You don't have to starve, you don't have to
fast, you don't have to become vegetarians,

01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:07.574
you don't have to go and sit in the sun or
meditate on Himalayas.

01:01:07.574 --> 01:01:09.375
Nothing of the kind.

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:14.405
Comfortably you can sit down wherever you
like and you can meditate.

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:18.145
Everything made easy.

01:01:18.145 --> 01:01:25.365
And once you've found out your Spirit, you
can enjoy everything that's beautiful.

01:01:25.365 --> 01:01:31.115
Now on the whole, maybe for some people this
is really too much.

01:01:31.115 --> 01:01:36.365
In a Sahara Desert you are sitting, everything
blowing on your head.

01:01:36.365 --> 01:01:37.365
"What is this?

01:01:37.365 --> 01:01:38.435
How can we live here?

01:01:38.435 --> 01:01:41.875
Such a rough life!"

01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:46.745
But you don't feel that way, because you have
the comfort of the Spirit within you.

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:50.145
It's the comfort of the Spirit.

01:01:50.145 --> 01:01:56.535
And for the comfort of Spirit you don't need
anything, that's what you have.

01:01:56.535 --> 01:02:01.265
So do not carry on with nonsensical things.

01:02:01.265 --> 01:02:03.215
Because Buddha went round and round.

01:02:03.215 --> 01:02:08.205
As we came today to this program, I was just
thinking like Buddha.

01:02:08.205 --> 01:02:12.525
Going from this end, again coming from this
end, then I couldn't find it, then that end,

01:02:12.525 --> 01:02:13.525
then coming this way.

01:02:13.324 --> 01:02:15.304
Ultimately we reached here, they said it's blocked!

01:02:15.304 --> 01:02:20.644
I said, "Give him a bandhan."

01:02:20.845 --> 01:02:22.625
Finished, open!

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:25.715
So this was blocked, that was blocked, go
this way, that way.

01:02:25.715 --> 01:02:27.955
All right, it was blocked for Him.

01:02:27.955 --> 01:02:30.655
So He went round and round.

01:02:30.655 --> 01:02:32.295
But it's not blocked for you.

01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:35.395
Why do you want to go round and round again?

01:02:35.395 --> 01:02:37.495
But that is what today everybody wants to
do the same way.

01:02:37.495 --> 01:02:41.005
"We must sacrifice, we must give up this,
we must do that."

01:02:41.005 --> 01:02:42.475
What are you going to sacrifice?

01:02:42.475 --> 01:02:45.535
What is there to sacrifice?

01:02:45.535 --> 01:02:55.625
I would like to know in Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:55.625 --> 01:03:04.175
Of course, mostly people sacrifice their brains,
I think.

01:03:04.175 --> 01:03:12.175
(Laughter) When nothing is to be sacrificed,
why do you want to become a goat of sacrifice?

01:03:12.175 --> 01:03:21.304
So from Buddha's life, you don't have to learn
that He went in the jungles and He went, He

01:03:21.304 --> 01:03:25.125
did this and He did also renunciation.

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:27.875
He gave up his wife.

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:28.875
No!

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:36.505
That's not needed now, that's over.

01:03:36.505 --> 01:03:43.834
This is where we fail and we cannot explain
to people that those who say, "But we must

01:03:43.834 --> 01:03:44.965
have renunciation."

01:03:44.965 --> 01:03:50.805
Renunciation we have from within, like the
sand, as I told you.

01:03:50.805 --> 01:03:53.995
Detachment we have from within.

01:03:53.995 --> 01:04:02.605
But this is compassion, pure compassion is
the most detached thing.

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:13.875
Is the most detached thing is the pure compassion,
or anything pure is pure because it is detached.

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:17.685
It's a proper mathematics.

01:04:17.685 --> 01:04:20.125
Anything that is pure has to be detached.

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:25.115
If it is attached it is contaminated.

01:04:25.115 --> 01:04:26.295
See the logic.

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:30.564
Absolute mathematics is there.

01:04:30.564 --> 01:04:34.025
If you have pure love then you are detached.

01:04:34.025 --> 01:04:38.515
Now supposing you love Mother - all right,
take that.

01:04:38.515 --> 01:04:46.735
Now you have say, pure love for Me, then you
won't get angry if I don't come to your house.

01:04:46.735 --> 01:04:51.225
You won't feel disappointed if I can't sit
in your car.

01:04:51.225 --> 01:04:56.005
You won't feel unhappy because I could not
touch your sari.

01:04:56.005 --> 01:04:58.455
Because, "I just love Mother, finished."

01:04:58.455 --> 01:05:01.095
It ends up there.

01:05:01.095 --> 01:05:03.735
Just pure love.

01:05:03.735 --> 01:05:08.705
Of course, I know these weaknesses, so I try
to please you, all right, all right.

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:16.185
But actually, if you really love Me, "It's
all right, I love Her, and She loves me, finished.

01:05:16.185 --> 01:05:22.365
Whether She comes to my house or not, whether
She gives me a present or not, whether She

01:05:22.365 --> 01:05:28.445
pats me or not, whether I can see Her or not,
whether I can meet Her or not.

01:05:28.244 --> 01:05:30.334
Makes no difference, I love Her."

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:32.275
That's the purity of love.

01:05:32.275 --> 01:05:38.885
Where there's no expectation of any kind,
except that I love and that love is the ocean

01:05:38.885 --> 01:05:45.635
of enjoyment and the ocean of bliss, finished.

01:05:45.635 --> 01:05:52.225
Is the easiest thing to do, is to love.

01:05:52.225 --> 01:05:56.835
Just love.

01:05:56.835 --> 01:06:04.875
How your heart increases like an ocean - I
just love.

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:08.345
The sea is not attached to any shore.

01:06:08.345 --> 01:06:13.805
When it has to come, it comes out, when it
has to go back, it goes back.

01:06:13.805 --> 01:06:17.195
When it has to give water for the rain, it
gives.

01:06:17.195 --> 01:06:23.345
The water goes as the clouds are formed, then
the water falls as rain, again it comes back

01:06:23.345 --> 01:06:24.685
to the sea.

01:06:24.685 --> 01:06:28.985
It doesn't stop anywhere.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:37.705
In the same way, if we just think, "Is the feeling
I have that I love Mother.

01:06:37.705 --> 01:06:38.935
What a feeling it is."

01:06:38.935 --> 01:06:47.985
That should be the end of everything, absolutely.

01:06:47.985 --> 01:06:54.735
I feel the same way; otherwise I would be
feeling every day guilty, "Oh, I didn't smile

01:06:54.735 --> 01:06:57.985
at that, I didn't give a present to this one.

01:06:57.985 --> 01:07:01.705
I should have brought something special for
that person.

01:07:01.705 --> 01:07:03.705
I was late for the program."

01:07:03.705 --> 01:07:14.965
(Laughter) But I
don't feel guilty because it's all managed.

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:20.665
If I had come earlier, all these hecklers
would have been there to trouble us.

01:07:20.665 --> 01:07:23.725
So all the horrible people disappeared and
we had the right people.

01:07:23.725 --> 01:07:26.875
Then I set down through.

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:29.705
I didn't say, "I'm going back."

01:07:29.705 --> 01:07:30.745
There is no need to be nervous.

01:07:30.745 --> 01:07:35.635
If Mother is late, there must be some plan.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:38.755
If She is early, there must be some plan.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:44.505
If She's going by this plane and not by the
other, there must be some plan.

01:07:44.505 --> 01:07:46.554
Not to doubt it.

01:07:46.554 --> 01:07:49.175
If She's doing something, must be some plan.

01:07:49.175 --> 01:07:52.245
You know, Mother has Her own plans.

01:07:52.245 --> 01:07:55.465
Is a nice idea to think like that.

01:07:55.465 --> 01:08:00.015
"She has Her own plans, you know."

01:08:00.015 --> 01:08:08.205
Once you start feeling that way, such security
and such beautiful peace will spread in your

01:08:08.205 --> 01:08:09.205
being.

01:08:09.205 --> 01:08:11.574
And you will be quite satisfied.

01:08:11.574 --> 01:08:15.695
Now, everybody brings food for Me, look at
that.

01:08:15.695 --> 01:08:21.965
I mean, when I see that I get a fright, baba.

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:27.195
(Laughter) I mean, look at that!

01:08:27.195 --> 01:08:34.805
I'm supposed to taste it, but even tasting
will be so much.

01:08:34.805 --> 01:08:43.445
(Laughter) But I've to eat, you know, because
if I don't touch one of them, then they will

01:08:43.445 --> 01:08:44.925
think, "Why didn't Mother touch?

01:08:44.925 --> 01:08:45.925
Must be something wrong."

01:08:45.925 --> 01:08:58.245
(Laughter) This is a very big problem for
Me, to keep you happy and to assure you.

01:08:58.245 --> 01:09:02.185
But I assure you that I love you all very
much!!

01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:07.334
Whether you bring food for Me, or flowers
for Me or anything.

01:09:07.334 --> 01:09:09.375
Does not matter.

01:09:09.174 --> 01:09:16.603
When I'm leaving Bogota, My heart is wrenching
out, I've seen the wrench of My heart, I've

01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:17.804
seen.

01:09:17.804 --> 01:09:21.725
Because I'm leaving all the new babes there,
that's all.

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:28.494
Then I just don't want to face, I mean, the
thing, I feel, "Oh God, just see I'm leaving

01:09:28.695 --> 01:09:29.695
them."

01:09:29.695 --> 01:09:33.725
But, because I love them.

01:09:33.524 --> 01:09:41.814
So I see, because I love them I feel it, so
it's all right, even this pain is all right, because

01:09:42.015 --> 01:09:43.765
I love them.

01:09:43.765 --> 01:09:48.415
I enjoy that pain because I love them.

01:09:48.415 --> 01:09:52.185
And then I come here and see all of you standing
at the airport.

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:54.935
Whole thing is fulfilled again.

01:09:54.935 --> 01:10:03.735
Just not because you have come - because I
have come to love you.

01:10:03.735 --> 01:10:09.655
All this is such a beautiful rapport and such
a beautiful feeling.

01:10:09.655 --> 01:10:16.455
I want you all to enjoy this and not petty
things and small things which spoil your joy.

01:10:16.455 --> 01:10:23.235
These are all joy killers and that's why the
greatest joy killer is the ego nonsensical,

01:10:23.235 --> 01:10:28.054
which tells you, "Oh, why didn't Mother do
this or do that?"

01:10:28.054 --> 01:10:30.215
It's the ego part of it.

01:10:30.215 --> 01:10:34.595
That's why we have to think of Buddha and
celebrate his Jayanti within ourselves to

01:10:34.595 --> 01:10:45.085
establish Him to say that, "This ego cannot
take away our joy."

01:10:45.085 --> 01:10:50.795
Anywhere such idea just comes into your head
tell them, "Now Mister ego, I know you very

01:10:50.795 --> 01:10:51.795
well!"

01:10:51.795 --> 01:10:57.935
(Laughter) In the light of Buddha you can
see your ego very clearly.

01:10:57.935 --> 01:11:01.834
And He's the killer of your ego, He's the
one who finishes off your ego.

01:11:01.834 --> 01:11:10.695
So today we have to pray for the whole of
America which is really suffering from this

01:11:10.695 --> 01:11:15.265
nonsensical, mythical ego, which is being
exploited by everyone.

01:11:15.265 --> 01:11:20.544
People are befooling them, the media is befooling,
all the doctors are befooling, all the psychologists

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:24.685
are befooling, all the governments are befooling.

01:11:24.685 --> 01:11:28.845
I mean, I don't know, everybody is befooled,
because they've got ego.

01:11:28.845 --> 01:11:31.435
If they had no ego, they could not have been
befooled.

01:11:31.435 --> 01:11:39.665
All these advertisements and all this hocus-pocus
that's going on, is because human beings have

01:11:39.665 --> 01:11:43.824
ego and they can't see it.

01:11:43.824 --> 01:11:52.125
So we have to say, "Mother, please take away
this curse of ego from Americans and America."

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:59.233
That's why it is nice today we have this Buddha
Puja.

01:11:59.275 --> 01:12:01.324
May God bless you!
