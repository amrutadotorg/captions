19900314 2nd Public Program, Auckland, New Zealand

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.250
For example, we work very hard, think too hard, you are right sided;

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:09.792
to compensate for it,

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.834
we take , say,

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.042
slipping pills or may be drinks, or something like that,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.792
just to compensate. We can’t bear it,

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.999
too much on the right.

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:24.083
But that doesn’t give you help, because you swing

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.876
from one end to another.

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:33.334
So, in the center you have to move,

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:37.584
and for that, there is a special mechanism within us.

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:41.584
As I told you yesterday, you have to have a very

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.626
scientific outlook, is to keep your mind open.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:48.959
If it works out, you have to accept as honest people.

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.792
We say we are skeptical. All right, but

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.959
we can keep ourselves open about it,

00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.292
that, afterall, we have not reached the absolute truth.

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.083
So, if you have to reach that truth, what should happen to us?

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:10.334
Maybe this is more known to the people in India, maybe,

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:15.167
because of their discoveries in the inner world.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.667
But has to be known, even in the West, because,

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:21.042
as I told you yesterday, that the tree

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.209
which has grown so big,

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.834
has to know his roots.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.209
Otherwise there is always a problem,

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:31.876
which you don’t know how to face.

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:35.250
So, as I have been told you about the roots, now,

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.417
about the left side and the right side,

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:40.876
the two sympathetic nervous system,

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:43.083
the left and the right,

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:45.709
both of them act separately,

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.709
which I think doctors do not know about.

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.000
About diabetes, now

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.000
- it's too much talking on Me, imbalance -

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.751
about diabetes somebody asked Me today,

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:09.709
how does he get diabetes by thinking.

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:14.834
In India, if you go to a village,

00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.792
they’ll ask you to take some tea and you just can’t take it,

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.999
because the sugar is so much, that the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.834
spoon has to stand at right angle.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And none of them get diabetes, none of them.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.459
But our bureaucrats in India, all of them get it.

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:43.292
Also the politicians.

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:49.209
The reason is, they think too much, they plan too much.

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:51.626
They are very right sided. Now,

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:53.626
which center does the right side work,

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:57.042
is the second center, which we call as Swadisthan.

00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:00.584
This second center, which is the Swadisthan,

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:04.459
is, as you can see very clearly,

00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:08.083
provides for right side activity.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:13.209
It is connected, upward passes through the optic chiasma,

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:16.751
goes to the left side,

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.125
creating our ego.

00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:23.999
Like you build this big hall,

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:27.792
so believe that you have done a great job.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.626
But actually, something that was dead,

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:34.042
that we have put together, that`s how hall is build.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.501
From dead to dead. We have done no living work so far.

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:42.834
But that creates an imaginary feeling

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.083
that we have done this, we have done that.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:50.501
And that's how this balloon of ego starts growing within us,

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.584
on one side.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.042
Now, when this Swadisthan is working,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.709
it has got a very important work to do, is to

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:11.792
replace the brain’s cells in our head,

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.626
which we are using for thinking,

00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:17.667
the grey cells. It has to do that.

00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:24.042
And because of this pressure of a thinker on that center,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.584
it neglects the other functions, that it has to do:

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:32.959
of looking after your liver, your pancreas,

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:37.250
your spleen and your kidneys

00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:41.334
and partly your digestive system.

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:47.584
As a result, all this organs go into problems.

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:53.751
One of them is the pancreas, which causes,

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.999
what we call, diabetes.

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.375
Liver goes out of order.

00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:02.501
When liver goes out of order,

00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:05.501
then the heat rises in your body.

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:07.959
From liver it rises higher,

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:11.959
goes upward and catches

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.542
on to the right heart center, as we call it,

00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:19.667
which gives you a disease called asthma.

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:24.083
Asthma can be easily cured, if you can look after

00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:27.083
your over active liver.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:31.751
It becomes over active, because it has very limited energy,

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.000
and it has to do its job,

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:39.042
of expelling poison from your body into the blood stream.

00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:44.584
But it has no energy to do that, so it becomes over active.

00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:47.417
And such a person, cannot also,

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.751
release all the heat of the body

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:53.626
into the bloodstream, so the heat starts passing over.

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.501
So much so, that it can reach heart,

00:05:57.751 --> 00:06:01.209
and the person can get a massive heart attack.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:04.709
In the young age, supposing some people,

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.999
who are playing tennis and smoking -

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:13.334
I mean all out to destroy them self in a way, I should say -

00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:16.000
or some very strenuous games

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.751
with that smoking and drinking

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:21.792
and pressurizing themselves, get a very

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:24.999
fatal heart attack, a massive heart attack.

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:31.042
Because they have gone in a complete out of balance situation.

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:37.876
Now, at the same time,

00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:40.834
the most dangerous thing

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.626
that can happen to us, because of this center,

00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:47.042
is that

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.709
we get a horrible disease called blood cancer.

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:54.417
Blood cancer comes to us because

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:59.250
of the spleen getting out of order or imbalanced.

00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:03.959
The spleen is a speedometer in us, or we can say it`s a,

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:08.709
it`s a rhythm keeper; it keeps our rhythm of life.

00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:11.834
But we are all the time out of rhythm.

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:15.667
You sleep at any time, get up at any time

00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:20.083
and any kind of emergency that comes in,

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:23.375
this organ has to supply,

00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:28.626
red blood corpuscles, RBCs , for the emergency,

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:33.375
any emergency rises. For example you are eating your food;

00:07:33.584 --> 00:07:35.918
and then suddenly you have to run,

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:37.584
then what happens,

00:07:37.792 --> 00:07:40.999
that you get pain here in the stomach, this side.

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:46.042
Because your spleen has started producing RBCs quickly.

00:07:46.334 --> 00:07:48.209
But we are all the time in tensions.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.167
All the time, you are very hectic.

00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:52.667
We get up in the morning, first thing we do

00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:55.000
horrible thing is to read newspapers.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.584
In the newspaper they never give good news,

00:07:57.792 --> 00:08:00.584
always has to be something sensational,

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:04.292
challenging your spleen.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:08.000
Then the...

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:11.918
Then the spleen, poor thing, starts

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:16.250
excreting or creating more RBCs (red blood cells).

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:22.250
And when that happens, the

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:28.000
person who is doing all these things,

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:33.334
does not realize that already he has tortured this pour spleen.

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:36.459
Again he goes into another hectic life,

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:38.125
for example he may

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:40.876
just jump into his car, he has to go to his office,

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:44.167
then he sees the jam and then he is very upset

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:48.792
because he gets late in the office, then the boss shouts at him,

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:51.792
something like that. All the time there is an emergency,

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:56.375
a time bound life. And all the time people are running up and down

00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:59.792
in a very hectic manner.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.167
And this hectic manner makes this pour spleen really crazy.

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:08.959
Doesn’t understand, what's the matter with this gentleman,

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:11.709
why is he behaving like this?

00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:15.918
Then the vulnerability is established.

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:20.626
And anything that happens from the left side,

00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:23.792
is just triggers the cancer.

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.834
I’ll show you how it works out.

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:30.834
This is one center say

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:32.834
from the left side and the right side,

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:36.501
both of them combine to form the real center.

00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:40.334
Now, If you are working too hard on the right side, like that,

00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:41.959
it starts moving,

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:44.751
taking the energy, exhausting the energy,  it is like this.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:48.876
And anything happens to the left, it just goes out.

00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:50.459
Now, it's broken,

00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:54.792
in the sense the relationship with the whole is lost.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:59.584
So, it gets on its own! It starts working

00:09:59.792 --> 00:10:03.250
on its own, we call it a malignant cell.

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:08.209
Means it starts growing, in such a way,

00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:13.667
that there is no relationship with other cells.

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:17.876
Or if the nose starts rising, growing,

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:20.250
then this place all gets covered,

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:22.918
this place all gets covered, your ear can get covered,

00:10:23.083 --> 00:10:27.459
and the rest of the cells are still growing at the same rate.

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:34.751
This malignancy is because of imbalance in us.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:38.042
Even ordinary cancer is cause by that.

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:40.999
So, what have we to do?

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:43.834
How are we to overcome these things?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.334
Of course, there are doctors and things.

00:10:46.584 --> 00:10:50.125
Most of them are looking after most of the people.

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:56.542
But those who are seeking the truth can be cured by themselves,

00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:59.501
because their Kundalini will rise.

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:03.083
When it rises, it nourishes that center,

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:07.999
it brings back the broken like this, nourishes them,

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:12.959
she integrates all the centers, so your thinking,

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:18.999
your heart, your stomach, your liver, all integrated.

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:21.999
You do not repent for anything.

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:24.709
You get an integrated personality,

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:27.667
you get a very
healthy personality.

00:11:27.876 --> 00:11:30.542
And such a person

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:35.667
automatically looks very

00:11:35.918 --> 00:11:39.000
healthy and very peaceful.

00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:41.876
Because the centers that are within us,

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:46.459
which are enlightened, are the centers

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:51.209
which are responsible for different functions in our body.

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:54.999
So the first one I have told you about, the second one,

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:57.918
and the first one I told you about yesterday,

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:00.042
and the next one to that,

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.834
is the center which is very important,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.959
is called as a navel center, Nabhi chakra.

00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:13.417
This is the one which looks after the solar plexus within us.

00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:16.876
So, physically we understand this,

00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:22.042
but spiritually this is a very important center.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.250
Because physically of course, you know the problem of the

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:32.792
solar plexuses, but there is another big problem we have,

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:35.083
and that is surrounding it,

00:12:35.292 --> 00:12:37.918
is the area,

00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:41.417
which we call in Sahaja Yoga as “Void”,

00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:43.834
which is to be crossed.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.584
Like,

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:48.417
Moses had to make a bridge , sort of a thing it is.

00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:50.709
You have to make a bridge.

00:12:50.918 --> 00:12:55.417
And this bridging comes when this part gets enlighten.

00:12:55.918 --> 00:13:00.918
Now, this part is made of

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:03.083
ten valences within us.

00:13:03.292 --> 00:13:05.999
Human beings have got ten valences.

00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:09.792
These ten valences are like Ten Commandments, we can say.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.584
But they are within us, not without.

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.918
Once they are enlightened,

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:18.751
than we rise in our own valences,

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:23.125
means we rise in our nature, as a human being.

00:13:23.334 --> 00:13:26.334
So, we become very righteous people.

00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.959
Like all saints are righteous,

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:31.959
they don’t do anything wrong, they don’t cheat,

00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:34.083
they don’t tell lies,

00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:38.501
they don’t take money, they don’t grab you, they don’t torture you,

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:44.918
they are very loving, dynamic, fearless people.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:49.125
All these qualities, suddenly,

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:56.918
manifest in a personality, which receives their Self-Realization.

00:13:57.626 --> 00:14:02.584
Thus we create a society of wonderful people.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.876
Then we come to another center, which we call

00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:12.209
as the center of the Mother

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:17.083
or Mana, but actually is the Heart center.

00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:21.792
Heart center in Sahaja Yoga we have three sides,

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:27.000
one is the left, is the heart, right heart and the central heart.

00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:32.834
Now, this is the center under the sternum bone,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.125
and all the antibodies are created in the sternum bone,

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:40.042
till you are twelve years of age.

00:14:40.709 --> 00:14:43.250
And then they

00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:46.876
go to various areas in the body,

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:50.626
and wait for a signal. This is a remote signal,

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:54.667
which comes from the sternum, sternum bone.

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:59.334
Now, those people who suffer from insecurities,

00:14:59.501 --> 00:15:03.209
especially women, if they suffer from some insecurities,

00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:07.334
from their husbands, or if their motherhood is challenged,

00:15:07.584 --> 00:15:12.918
then they develop a very horrible cancer of the breast.

00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:16.042
If they are insecure from their husbands,

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:22.417
who are not loyal to them, or some sort of a problem is there,

00:15:22.626 --> 00:15:26.417
then the women may develop this breast cancer,

00:15:26.999 --> 00:15:31.167
because of this center, being absolutely dislocated,

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:33.667
due to insecurities,

00:15:33.876 --> 00:15:37.501
Whenever we see anything facing us which is dangerous,

00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:41.792
immediately our sternum bone starts vibrating.

00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:45.792
Those vibrations are remotely caught by the antibodies,

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:49.334
and they get ready to fight the diseases.

00:15:49.584 --> 00:15:53.334
But when the connection is lost

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:56.417
and the cells become malignant,

00:15:56.709 --> 00:16:00.292
antibodies also get tired fighting it.

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:03.501
So when the Kundalini is passing through this,

00:16:03.918 --> 00:16:06.834
this center gets again nourished,

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:13.584
and one can achieve a great sense of security within himself,

00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:19.209
very great sense of security. He feels absolutely secure.

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:26.709
Then the same Kundalini rises, up to the center we call as Vishudhi.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:32.501
This center is the one, which

00:16:32.709 --> 00:16:36.792
looks after sixteen things.

00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:41.417
You can say ear, nose, tongue, teeth, everything.

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.626
They are sixteen things it looks; it has got sixteen petals.

00:16:45.918 --> 00:16:50.334
Face, eyes, everything it looks after.

00:16:50.584 --> 00:16:53.751
But it can also go out of order,

00:16:54.042 --> 00:16:56.751
when we go into imbalances about it.

00:16:57.167 --> 00:17:00.167
As a result, a person loses many things.

00:17:00.417 --> 00:17:04.417
But when, you are nourished by it

00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:07.501
by the Kundalini, then what happens?

00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:10.626
That you just become a witness.

00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:17.000
You, somehow or other, get out of the crazy world

00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:20.751
and you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:23.250
Like, you are seeing some drama, supposing,

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:25.209
and then you see Napoleon.

00:17:25.417 --> 00:17:27.250
Then you think you are also Napoleon,

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.834
and you start really going with him.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.999
But when the drama is over, then suddenly you realize,

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:35.375
“Oh, I am not Napoleon, I am something else!”

00:17:35.584 --> 00:17:39.501
In the same way, when we are involved in this mad world,

00:17:39.709 --> 00:17:42.000
then we are upset.

00:17:42.417 --> 00:17:44.417
Say, we are standing in the water,

00:17:44.667 --> 00:17:47.042
we are afraid of getting drowned.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.751
The water rises, falls down again,

00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:53.876
there is another wave comes and goes down.

00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:59.792
But supposing, somehow, you get onto a boat,

00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:02.542
then you can watch that water,

00:18:02.751 --> 00:18:04.999
and if you become an expert swimmer,

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.626
you can jump in and save others also.

00:18:07.834 --> 00:18:12.417
The same thing happens, that you just start

00:18:13.083 --> 00:18:15.584
seeing the whole thing like a drama.

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:18.375
Your problem you see as a drama.

00:18:18.626 --> 00:18:21.209
Now, because you are not in that problem,

00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:24.083
you can solve your problem, very easily.

00:18:24.292 --> 00:18:26.834
It’s very simple to solve that problem,

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:30.292
because you are not in it. If you are involve in it you are going

00:18:30.501 --> 00:18:31.834
into a turmoil.

00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:35.167
But if you are out of it, you know what is the solution

00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:38.709
and it can be solved very easily.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.125
Now, the center that we call as the Agya chakra,

00:18:42.334 --> 00:18:47.334
which is placed between the optic chiasma, is very important.

00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:50.626
On one side, it looks after the pituitary

00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:54.083
and the other side it looks after the pineal body.

00:18:54.292 --> 00:18:59.250
Now the pituitary is responsible for controlling this Mr. Ego,

00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:02.667
and on the other side we have got superego

00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:05.209
which is created by our conditionings.

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:07.792
We have so many conditionings.

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:10.292
We have conditionings of the country where we are born in,

00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:13.375
we have conditionings in the family we are born in,

00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:15.834
our parents and then we have

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
conditionings with the religion we are born in,

00:19:18.209 --> 00:19:20.667
and all kind of conditionings we have.

00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:24.709
All these conditionings make the another balloon,

00:19:24.918 --> 00:19:29.876
and both of them form a crest on our head

00:19:30.042 --> 00:19:31.918
that’s how our fontanel bone area,

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:35.209
which was a soft bone become a hard bone.

00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:39.042
But when the Kundalini rises

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.417
and passes through this center, it sucks in.

00:19:44.209 --> 00:19:48.083
That's how our karmas, so called, whatever action or

00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:51.667
wrong things we have done or the wrong conditionings we have,

00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:54.250
everything gets sucked in

00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:57.209
and it opens like a petal.

00:19:57.501 --> 00:20:01.209
The limbic area, that is between, opens

00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:03.334
and the Kundalini passes through,

00:20:03.626 --> 00:20:05.959
pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:10.042
and you start feeling the cool breeze out of your head.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.250
You are surprised how it happened.

00:20:12.459 --> 00:20:16.417
And then you can feel it all around you is cool breeze .

00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:19.209
which is the All Pervading Power.

00:20:19.417 --> 00:20:23.375
As a result that you become one with this,

00:20:23.626 --> 00:20:26.626
all the time the energy is flowing through you

00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:29.417
and though you may going into imbalances a little bit,

00:20:29.667 --> 00:20:32.375
but you come to balance in no time.

00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:35.334
This is as far as the physical side is concerned.

00:20:35.584 --> 00:20:38.167
Mentally you feel perfectly all right,

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:43.709
but above all, you develop a new dimension in your awareness,

00:20:43.918 --> 00:20:47.959
which we call as “collective consciousness”.

00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:53.959
Collective consciousness about which, Jung has said lots of things.

00:20:54.417 --> 00:20:57.918
Collective consciousness is where you can feel the centers of others

00:20:58.083 --> 00:20:59.999
on your fingertips

00:21:00.167 --> 00:21:05.167
and also you can feel your own centers.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:09.292
And if you know to correct yours and then of others,

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:13.209
you can easily manage the whole thing.

00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:17.751
So this collective consciousness is the one, is the new awareness,

00:21:17.959 --> 00:21:20.918
a new dimension, which one has to achieve.

00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:24.167
This is the new birth,

00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:27.626
or we should say, the second birth, as we call it.

00:21:27.834 --> 00:21:30.709
In Sanskrit language

00:21:30.918 --> 00:21:35.834
is called as, a person who is

00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:41.667
a realized soul, is called a “dwijaha”, means born twice.

00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:45.417
And a bird is also called dwijaha, because first is an egg

00:21:45.709 --> 00:21:49.667
and then it is born as a bird, a free bird.

00:21:49.959 --> 00:21:54.959
In the same way, a person who is a realized soul has a second birth.

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:58.083
As they say, ”You are to be born again”, it happens.

00:21:58.292 --> 00:22:01.417
But it is actualization, it is not just a certificate.

00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:04.709
Anybody can take a certificate, ”I am this, I am that”,

00:22:04.918 --> 00:22:06.417
that makes no difference.

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:10.209
Because you must have the powers, of what you are.

00:22:10.417 --> 00:22:13.918
If you are a human being, you have, you have human powers.

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:18.334
In the same way, if you become a realized soul, super human being,

00:22:18.584 --> 00:22:22.459
than you must have the powers of a super human being.

00:22:22.834 --> 00:22:25.292
If you don’t have these powers, it is no use

00:22:25.501 --> 00:22:28.042
giving a false certificate like that.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.292
Same as I told you about religion,
when somebody asked Me the question,

00:22:31.626 --> 00:22:34.000
that why are they fight
in the name of religion?

00:22:34.209 --> 00:22:36.792
Because it's man-made.

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:41.584
Saints never fight. They never fight.

00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:45.999
They love and they understand each other and they know the Absolute.

00:22:47.459 --> 00:22:52.209
So, when your Spirit, which is in your heart,

00:22:52.584 --> 00:22:55.334
has the seat here

00:22:55.501 --> 00:22:59.751
and it gets connected with your attention,

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:03.918
then the light of the Spirit makes you an enlightened person,

00:23:04.167 --> 00:23:08.999
and in that light, you know what is right and what is wrong.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.876
What is good for you, what is constructive and what is destructive.

00:23:14.834 --> 00:23:17.584
The power of Spirit is,

00:23:17.792 --> 00:23:21.250
that of course it's a collective being within us, no doubt,

00:23:21.626 --> 00:23:24.417
also we say that we are part and a parcel of the whole.

00:23:24.709 --> 00:23:26.167
But we are not.

00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:28.834
Once you become collectively conscious,

00:23:28.999 --> 00:23:31.918
then you are only part and parcel of the whole.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.042
Then you become

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.542
the source of joy.

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:43.000
Spirit is the source of joy. You become joyous,

00:23:43.209 --> 00:23:44.834
you are full of joy.

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:48.542
Joy s not double-faced,

00:23:48.751 --> 00:23:50.751
it's not like happiness - unhappiness.

00:23:50.959 --> 00:23:55.501
It's a permanent state of enjoyment.

00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:58.999
And, you know the absolute truth.

00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:03.209
On your fingertips you can know. Even in the Koran, as I told you,

00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:07.209
in the Koran it is said that, “Your hands will speak

00:24:07.417 --> 00:24:09.459
at the time of your Resurrection,

00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:12.000
and they will give witness against you”.

00:24:12.209 --> 00:24:16.000
So, this is the time of your Judgment, Last Judgment,

00:24:16.209 --> 00:24:20.083
when your Kundalini is going to tell you, where you stand.

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:24.918
And once you correct yourself, you enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:24:25.083 --> 00:24:31.542
This has to happen. It's nothing artificial about it, is all

00:24:31.751 --> 00:24:33.918
living process

00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:38.375
of a living energy, which works

00:24:38.584 --> 00:24:42.667
and you cannot pay for it. You cannot pay for it.

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:45.834
This is the only snag, if there is anything.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.584
So may God bless you all.

00:24:49.876 --> 00:24:53.250
Yesterday we spent lot of time asking questions and answering,

00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:56.542
I don’t mind a little bit of that, but not too much...

00:24:56.751 --> 00:24:59.459
Yesterday we had too many questions and answers.

00:24:59.709 --> 00:25:04.125
So, if you could ask Me some questions, is all right.

00:25:04.501 --> 00:25:07.792
But should be relevant. Because you know, I’m not here

00:25:07.999 --> 00:25:11.459
to get anything out of you, is just to tell you what you have,

00:25:11.709 --> 00:25:14.083
to give you what is yours.

00:25:14.584 --> 00:25:18.167
It all happens because of your energy.

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:22.000
I have nothing to do with it in a way.

00:25:22.209 --> 00:25:27.417
Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another light.

00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:35.918
Q: Could you tell something about the nadis?

00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:39.709
SM: Nadis... You didn’t tell them?

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:46.751
He told Me he has already talked to you!

00:25:48.751 --> 00:25:53.125
The left one is known as the Ida Nadi,

00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:55.667
which get us to the left side.

00:25:55.876 --> 00:25:59.999
The right one as the Pingala Nadi, which gets us to the right side.

00:26:00.417 --> 00:26:03.999
The central one is known as the Sushumna Nadi.

00:26:04.334 --> 00:26:07.042
Also, there are a many other details about it,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.999
which once you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will know a lot of.

00:26:11.999 --> 00:26:15.417
It's too much really, because I must have given at least

00:26:15.709 --> 00:26:17.792
three thousand to four thousands lectures,

00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:19.501
in English language itself,

00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:22.959
and they are all on the tape, you can always listen to them.

00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:26.584
Knowledge is like a vast ocean,

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:30.626
and the source of knowledge is your Spirit.

00:26:30.918 --> 00:26:32.501
So, once you are realized,

00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:35.709
you will be able to understand everything.

00:26:51.417 --> 00:26:54.918
Q: What happens when a huge amount of energy comes out of here

00:26:55.083 --> 00:26:58.417
and manifests himself in forms of pictures?

00:26:58.626 --> 00:27:00.667
Is, is a,

00:27:00.876 --> 00:27:03.876
that means this center is broken.

00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:05.918
Is not all right.

00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:08.626
You shouldn’t see anything.

00:27:08.834 --> 00:27:11.792
You shouldn’t see the light. You have to be the light.

00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:15.584
If I see the light, then I’m not the light!

00:27:16.459 --> 00:27:18.375
All right?

00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:32.709
Q:How much influence does food have on the collective consciousness?

00:27:32.918 --> 00:27:34.792
SM: - What has... ?
P: - Food.

00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:41.834
Food... You see, is food, food we deal with in such a manner,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.542
that whatever is deficient in a person,

00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:49.709
whatever is complementary in a person, should be eaten.

00:27:51.292 --> 00:27:54.709
Like, you have to,

00:27:54.999 --> 00:27:58.751
supposing, you people are very right sided

00:27:58.959 --> 00:28:01.459
then you must take to carbohydrates;

00:28:01.834 --> 00:28:05.999
but if you are left sided, then you have to take to proteins.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:12.292
But very big animals than human beings are not to be eaten,

00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:15.250
because their muscles are very big,

00:28:15.459 --> 00:28:18.667
and they cause troubles to your teeth and things like that.

00:28:18.876 --> 00:28:22.417
But food becomes the secondary thing,

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:26.876
after you have had the ambrosia of Realization.

00:28:27.042 --> 00:28:28.667
It is no so important.

00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:32.584
Just don’t bother too much about food, at all.

00:28:44.459 --> 00:28:46.876
SM: What  is he saying?

00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:19.999
Q: How the people balance?

00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:24.000
Individually, everybody has a different set of problems.

00:29:24.209 --> 00:29:26.667
How does each individual balance ?

00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:29.417
Bring them back to the balance.

00:29:29.709 --> 00:29:33.459
SM: I mean, first is, of course, individual balance,

00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:38.209
and when you are individually balanced,

00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:41.792
then when you are the Spirit,

00:29:41.999 --> 00:29:44.083
then it's a collective consciousness.

00:29:44.292 --> 00:29:47.501
In that the Spirit gives you

00:29:47.709 --> 00:29:50.751
an absolute nature.

00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:52.999
And everybody being absolute

00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:55.999
there is no problem of balancing with anyone else.

00:29:56.167 --> 00:29:58.501
You just enjoy each other. That's all.

00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:01.000
Only you are dressed up differently,

00:30:01.209 --> 00:30:04.999
you comb your hair differently. That doesn’t matter.

00:30:05.209 --> 00:30:10.000
That’s all outside. But inside you enjoy each other.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.417
There is a beautiful

00:30:13.626 --> 00:30:16.876
thing said about one poet

00:30:17.042 --> 00:30:20.250
Namadeva - yesterday i told them about that one, no? -

00:30:20.459 --> 00:30:25.792
about Namadeva, who was a tailor, just a tailor.

00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:29.334
And he went to see another realized soul,

00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:33.000
another saint, in another village,

00:30:33.209 --> 00:30:35.292
who was a potter.

00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:40.334
And the potter was needing the clay with his feet

00:30:40.501 --> 00:30:43.334
when this Namadeva went there.

00:30:43.626 --> 00:30:46.584
And he went and he stood, stand.

00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:51.042
And he said, a beautiful poem he has written,

00:30:51.334 --> 00:30:54.876
that, „I came here to see

00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:58.250
the formless", means the vibrations.

00:30:58.501 --> 00:31:00.792
"I came here to feel the vibrations,

00:31:00.999 --> 00:31:03.792
I came here to see the formless,

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:06.751
but the whole formless is in your form!”

00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:09.626
What an appreciation, what an enjoyment

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:12.709
and what endearment it creates.

00:31:12.918 --> 00:31:15.876
I mean, we human beings never talk like that, you see.

00:31:16.042 --> 00:31:21.751
When we talk to each other is so artificial and can be very

00:31:21.959 --> 00:31:25.209
selfish , can be very skimming and
can be anything. You just don’t know.

00:31:25.417 --> 00:31:27.834
If somebody says, ”Thank you” to you, you often start thinking

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.834
”Why, what did I do?”

00:31:32.834 --> 00:31:34.959
Or somebody says something bad about you,

00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:36.918
”You should know I've done nothing good for him,

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:39.334
why is it saying bad about me, I don't know”,

00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:41.250
is like that, you see, is not that.

00:31:41.459 --> 00:31:44.292
It’s absolutely clear cut.

00:31:44.667 --> 00:31:47.959
Cristal clear temperament you get, absolutely.

00:31:48.918 --> 00:31:52.209
You become crystal clear and the other person is also crystal clear

00:31:52.417 --> 00:31:54.501
and they are just enjoy each other. That`s all.

00:31:54.709 --> 00:31:56.083
We have never enjoy each other.

00:31:56.292 --> 00:31:58.792
Actually we have never used the Power of Love,

00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:00.751
we have always use the power of hatred.

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:02.375
Anything that you want to do,

00:32:02.584 --> 00:32:06.167
you have to put some sort of an issue to fight.

00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:09.042
Here there is no such question.

00:32:11.167 --> 00:32:13.042
Such a state we all should have,

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.459
for the emancipation of humanity,

00:32:15.751 --> 00:32:18.626
for the emancipation of our country,

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:21.042
all the countries, all over the world,

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.292
for our children and for ourselves.

00:32:26.167 --> 00:32:28.834
- Yes Sir ?

00:32:36.876 --> 00:32:41.000
Q: What happens to Kundalini, whether a major accident,

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.999
or some injury to this area?

00:32:44.209 --> 00:32:47.584
SM: We have to correct it. If it's physically very much injured,

00:32:47.792 --> 00:32:51.125
it can be corrected. There is no such problem.

00:32:52.876 --> 00:32:55.042
Yes, please.

00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:18.000
Q: Everything in creation isn't it connected,

00:33:18.209 --> 00:33:22.667
therefore couldn't there be

00:33:24.918 --> 00:33:29.250
could it be possible that free choice is actually Maya?

00:33:37.999 --> 00:33:42.667
SM: You have free choice to know it’s Maya.

00:33:48.042 --> 00:33:50.709
You have to reach that point.

00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:54.000
Otherwise you will never accept. You see, you are a human beings.

00:33:54.209 --> 00:33:56.209
If you are told anything you'll never accept it.

00:33:56.417 --> 00:34:00.083
So it's better to reach that point, where to feel that is all

00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:02.626
sort of illusion.

00:34:02.876 --> 00:34:05.375
And then you discover it.

00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:08.584
You have to have that much free choice.

00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:12.876
You are made that way.

00:34:13.125 --> 00:34:18.042
And such a choice is to be accepted, to be respected.

00:34:32.834 --> 00:34:35.334
Q: Kundalini is such a strong force.

00:34:35.501 --> 00:34:41.250
Now, what happens when it doesn’t actually achieve a connection?

00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:46.834
SM:In Sahaja Yoga we'll see that it reaches that  point.

00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:50.417
But it is a force like.

00:34:51.959 --> 00:34:54.876
In a seed there is a primule.

00:34:55.167 --> 00:34:59.083
And the primule first just sprouts

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:03.334
then a little plant it becomes,

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:06.209
gradually it becomes a very big tree.

00:35:06.417 --> 00:35:09.626
And out of that tree, thousands of seeds coming.

00:35:09.834 --> 00:35:13.918
So, in that little bit of that seed,

00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:18.959
there are the maps of all these creations.

00:35:19.375 --> 00:35:22.375
In the same way, that Kundalini is a force.

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:27.876
Supposing it rises and it reaches the apex also

00:35:28.042 --> 00:35:29.584
and is not established,

00:35:29.792 --> 00:35:32.250
then we have to remember the parabola of Christ,

00:35:32.459 --> 00:35:37.000
that, ”Some of the seeds fell in the marshy land and got lost”.

00:35:37.584 --> 00:35:41.083
Then again they take birth, then again they work it out.

00:35:41.334 --> 00:35:44.501
So, best is getting done, once for all.

00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:49.292
The time has come, is the blossom time, better have it done.

00:35:52.042 --> 00:35:53.918
Q: Perhaps now would be the time.

00:35:54.209 --> 00:35:58.083
SM: Of course. Perhaps now it is, it is the time.

00:36:00.125 --> 00:36:02.375
Yes, please.

00:36:21.626 --> 00:36:25.334
Q: Can any yoga balance the mind?

00:36:25.584 --> 00:36:27.709
SM: Cannot.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:32.334
Any other yoga is a part and parcel of the same.

00:36:32.501 --> 00:36:35.334
Actually, they have separated.

00:36:36.792 --> 00:36:40.999
They have taken out one part of yoga, one part of yoga there.

00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:44.709
It's a, if you see the Patanjali Yoga it is Ashtangas,

00:36:44.918 --> 00:36:47.125
means there are eight full.

00:36:47.834 --> 00:36:51.584
And basically is dealt with the ascent,

00:36:51.792 --> 00:36:55.999
with the thoughtless awareness, which are Nirvichar Samadhi,

00:36:56.209 --> 00:37:00.083
and then with the doubtless awareness, which has to be achieved,

00:37:00.292 --> 00:37:03.751
and that is only through the Kundalini awakening.

00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:07.999
Also, he has suggested some exercises that have to be done,

00:37:08.167 --> 00:37:09.834
if it is necessary.

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:12.334
When the Kundalini rises, we know what the problem is,

00:37:12.501 --> 00:37:14.792
and we can do the exercises.

00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:19.417
And so, all the yogas are included in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:23.042
When the Kundalini rises, then it goes into Raja Yoga,

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.834
in the sense that one center augments,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.834
when the Kundalini is passed through that.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Supposing the Kundalini has come out of it,

00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:33.167
then it has to close,

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:35.042
because it has to stop the Kundalini.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.459
Then it passes through another, then it has to close again.

00:37:38.709 --> 00:37:40.334
All these is called bhandan.

00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:42.667
But this is not to be done outside.

00:37:42.876 --> 00:37:45.083
It is to be done by the machinery itself

00:37:45.292 --> 00:37:47.751
which works spontaneously, automatically.

00:37:47.959 --> 00:37:49.999
Yesterday I told you, as the car starts,

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:51.834
all the machine starts working.

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:54.918
But without starting the car, if you start moving the wheels,

00:37:55.083 --> 00:37:58.000
what will happen?

00:38:09.959 --> 00:38:12.876
Q: How this period that we are living in now,

00:38:13.042 --> 00:38:15.667
be viewed from the future?

00:38:16.083 --> 00:38:19.999
SM: Viewd from the future? Is the excellent time, the best time.

00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:23.918
And then we are not thinking of future or of past.

00:38:24.083 --> 00:38:27.250
Once we enter into that, then we just enjoy the present,

00:38:27.459 --> 00:38:30.959
which we have never enjoyed. Because future doesn’t exist.

00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:34.083
The past is over. We have to be in present.

00:38:34.292 --> 00:38:36.167
So we establish ourselves in present

00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:38.751
and enjoy every moment of it.

00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:45.709
Future is just our imagination, idea.

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:58.292
Q: Can one person release the energy for another?

00:38:58.501 --> 00:39:01.626
SM: Of course. That’s what I said.

00:39:01.876 --> 00:39:05.000
One enlighten person can enlighten another person.

00:39:07.876 --> 00:39:10.584
Q: Through the method of Shiatsu?

00:39:10.792 --> 00:39:12.709
Shiatsu.

00:39:14.417 --> 00:39:17.292
SM: No, there is not such a thing. Only under your hand.

00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:19.834
You can move it. It moves through your hand.

00:39:19.999 --> 00:39:23.292
Just if you move like this, you can do it.

00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:24.959
As simple as that.

00:39:25.125 --> 00:39:29.292
It has to be simple. Because it is so vital.

00:39:41.042 --> 00:39:44.000
Q: Krishnamurti doesn't believe this,

00:39:44.209 --> 00:39:48.459
he believes that the health can come to you...

00:39:50.918 --> 00:39:52.999
It has to come to you.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.334
SM: You see, Krishnamurti has said too many things.

00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:08.792
Talking is not the way,

00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:12.501
it is the actualization, is the becoming.  That is important.

00:40:12.751 --> 00:40:15.209
So many books have been written. I tell you.

00:40:15.417 --> 00:40:18.959
Even you see the books, one goes mad the way this is written

00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:22.000
and really people are wondering, "What is what? What is what?"

00:40:22.209 --> 00:40:24.042
Who want to go? What to do?

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.999
Actually, it's the actualization.

00:40:27.209 --> 00:40:30.459
It's the actualization that is important.

00:40:32.626 --> 00:40:35.250
Q: Should I ask You, now is the time for that actualization?

00:40:35.459 --> 00:40:37.292
SM: Yes, of course.

00:40:37.626 --> 00:40:42.042
It's all right. There's one lady there. Yes, madam.

00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:16.209
What is she reading?

00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:24.167
What is it?

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.000
I can get few words.

00:41:59.209 --> 00:42:01.334
Q:I think I got the message now.

00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:05.876
Mother the lady is asking a question as to,

00:42:06.042 --> 00:42:09.584
she is wondering whether the awakening of Kundalini

00:42:09.792 --> 00:42:12.292
can in fact be dangerous? She's red a number of books where...

00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:15.918
SM: Yes, yes, is correct. That I should have covered already.

00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:18.918
It is not dangerous at all. At all.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.834
You see this books are written by people

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.626
who are absolutely unauthorized.

00:42:22.876 --> 00:42:25.125
Have they raised anybody's Kundalini? They have not.

00:42:25.375 --> 00:42:28.459
But, just, just a moment, sit down, sit down.

00:42:28.709 --> 00:42:30.584
You see, this job is to be done by

00:42:30.792 --> 00:42:33.417
somebody who is authorized by the Divine.

00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:36.501
Every Tom, Dick and Harry can not do it.

00:42:36.792 --> 00:42:39.626
You see, when you put, supposing aplug into the,

00:42:39.834 --> 00:42:41.501
you put your hand into the plug

00:42:41.709 --> 00:42:43.709
and say that electricity is dangerous,

00:42:43.918 --> 00:42:45.667
because you don’t know what plug is.

00:42:45.876 --> 00:42:48.751
You have to know it. If you know it, you can do it.

00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:51.876
Is not, this is all modern, is all modern I think,

00:42:52.042 --> 00:42:54.584
is more 20th century knowledge that has come up.

00:42:54.834 --> 00:42:57.667
None of the old books have written such a nonsense like that.

00:42:57.876 --> 00:42:59.083
This is just to frighten people

00:42:59.292 --> 00:43:02.250
so that they don’t gate their Realization, is the point!

00:43:02.459 --> 00:43:04.250
She is your Mother.

00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:08.209
Kundalini is your Mother, your individual Mother

00:43:08.417 --> 00:43:11.292
and She knows each and every thing about you.

00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:14.834
Not only that, but She is such a loving Mother,

00:43:14.999 --> 00:43:17.000
that She gives your rebirth,

00:43:17.209 --> 00:43:21.417
without even you knowing about it, till you realy feel it.

00:43:21.709 --> 00:43:23.834
It’s so wonderful!

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.209
Now, your mother, when she gave your birth,

00:43:27.417 --> 00:43:29.751
she took up all the labor pains upon herself.

00:43:29.959 --> 00:43:32.626
In the same way, now we have thousands of people

00:43:32.834 --> 00:43:34.751
who got Realization.

00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:38.250
Nobody felt anything bad except sometimes you do feel little heat,

00:43:38.459 --> 00:43:40.417
that's all. Thousands of people.

00:43:40.667 --> 00:43:43.292
But the people who have written that, is all modern style.

00:43:43.501 --> 00:43:46.626
On the contrary, there was

00:43:46.876 --> 00:43:48.918
a great saint called Ramadasa,

00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:52.209
at the time os Shivaji. He was the guru of Shivaji.

00:43:52.417 --> 00:43:54.918
Was a very well known king of Maharashtra.

00:43:55.083 --> 00:43:57.375
And somebody asked him that,

00:43:57.626 --> 00:44:00.000
“How much time takes does it take for a Kundalini to rise?”

00:44:00.209 --> 00:44:03.709
So he used a Sanskrit word means tatkshana, means that moment.

00:44:03.918 --> 00:44:07.834
But the person who has to do it has to be authorized,

00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:11.876
and the person who has to take it, must desire it!

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.459
That is the word used.

00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:16.083
This is all modern nonsense that has come up to sell books.

00:44:16.292 --> 00:44:20.125
That's all I think. Or some of the people, who have no authority,

00:44:20.334 --> 00:44:22.375
those who led a very funny life.

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:25.792
I know of someone who has written a funny book about Kundalini,

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:28.834
who has a very bad life of his own,

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:33.918
and he says that, "I got such a shock, I got this, that". Naturally.

00:44:34.584 --> 00:44:37.334
You had no business to enter into an area,

00:44:37.584 --> 00:44:39.751
where you are not authorized.

00:44:39.959 --> 00:44:43.999
And if so, also you should have gone to somebody who is authorized.

00:44:44.209 --> 00:44:48.209
The authority has to come from the Divine, that’s important.

00:44:54.918 --> 00:44:57.083
Q: Who is your guru he is asking?

00:44:57.292 --> 00:45:01.125
I am my own guru and I’ll make you your own guru.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.167
You don't have to go to any guru, anymore.

00:45:07.417 --> 00:45:12.167
You become your own guru. When the Atma, the Spirit comes into you,

00:45:12.375 --> 00:45:14.999
then you don’t need any guru. Why do you need?

00:45:15.709 --> 00:45:17.792
Of course I can give you guidance

00:45:17.999 --> 00:45:21.918
and at the most, you can call Me, The Mother. That’s all.

00:45:23.959 --> 00:45:26.667
There is no need to be subservient to anyone.

00:45:26.876 --> 00:45:30.209
There is no need to pay anyone. Of course, not, you cannot pay.

00:45:30.417 --> 00:45:33.000
Anybody who takes your money is your servant,

00:45:33.209 --> 00:45:35.209
a man has no self respect.

00:45:35.417 --> 00:45:39.042
He takes money from you for God, how can he?

00:45:41.584 --> 00:45:45.000
And we also, very foolishly, give money to such horrible people,

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:47.792
who are just devils!

00:45:48.501 --> 00:45:51.584
They are evil geniuses.

00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:54.167
And the way they have managed this,

00:45:54.417 --> 00:45:57.959
is they have realy made so many people so very sick,

00:45:58.125 --> 00:46:00.999
that sometimes, I do not know,

00:46:01.209 --> 00:46:04.709
where are they going to land up, the way they have been.

00:46:05.626 --> 00:46:07.792
How madam?

00:46:10.125 --> 00:46:13.751
Q: Can You give us some person, can You give us somebody

00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:15.792
individually, when You say this?

00:46:15.999 --> 00:46:18.125
SM:Most of them are in the market.

00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:20.918
They are in the market.

00:46:21.083 --> 00:46:23.501
I need not take their names, at this auspicious time.

00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:26.000
Horrible people.

00:46:28.626 --> 00:46:31.042
Yes, madam?

00:46:38.042 --> 00:46:42.292
Q: Is being over-emotional concerned with thinking?

00:46:43.918 --> 00:46:45.501
SM: More emotional...

00:46:45.709 --> 00:46:47.999
Q: Is over-emotional, she is saying.

00:46:48.167 --> 00:46:51.083
SM: Yes, you see, both ways one thinks.

00:46:51.292 --> 00:46:53.417
Over-emotional people also think

00:46:53.626 --> 00:46:56.667
and those who are not emotional also think.

00:46:56.876 --> 00:46:59.667
This is no question, it acts on both the sides.

00:46:59.876 --> 00:47:02.667
The emotional people think of the past, "Oh, I was so happy,

00:47:02.876 --> 00:47:06.167
now I am so unhappy", sort of a thing, you see?

00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:11.709
And the people who are not emotional

00:47:11.918 --> 00:47:15.042
think how to make others unhappy?

00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:39.709
Q: How does what You are talking about line up

00:47:39.918 --> 00:47:43.292
with what is written in the Bible, about salvation?

00:47:43.626 --> 00:47:45.667
SM: About what?
Q: Salvation.

00:47:45.876 --> 00:47:48.709
SM: Same thing it is Madam, is the same thing.

00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:52.250
Absolutely, Bible can be only explained through Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:52.584 --> 00:47:55.083
Gita can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:55.292 --> 00:47:57.250
Koran can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:57.459 --> 00:47:59.792
You have to read between the lines.

00:48:00.042 --> 00:48:02.334
Christ was given only three, four years.

00:48:02.584 --> 00:48:05.626
What is three, four years to explain anything?

00:48:05.999 --> 00:48:08.417
People were so cruel.

00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:10.250
You know, I was in London,

00:48:10.459 --> 00:48:12.792
four years I was struggling with seven hippies.

00:48:12.999 --> 00:48:15.334
Couldn't give them Realization, it's so horrible.

00:48:15.584 --> 00:48:18.125
What could He do in four years?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.792
It’s not an easy thing to work it out.

00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:44.542
Q: Is Kundalini the only force in this particular time,

00:48:44.751 --> 00:48:46.334
that will do this particular job?

00:48:46.501 --> 00:48:50.459
SM: No, all the time this was the force, all the time.

00:48:50.667 --> 00:48:52.626
It's all the time, this was the force.

00:48:52.834 --> 00:48:55.918
It’s called also, in the Bible it is said,

00:48:56.083 --> 00:48:59.501
that about the tree of life, is this mechanism.

00:48:59.751 --> 00:49:03.876
Also said that "I'll appear before you as tongues of flames"

00:49:04.042 --> 00:49:06.417
is the, the, when the Kundalini rises,

00:49:06.626 --> 00:49:08.334
then your centers look like that.

00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:10.751
So many things there are even in the Bible.

00:49:10.959 --> 00:49:13.459
In everything, in Koran it is called as Asas,

00:49:13.709 --> 00:49:16.959
the names are different, but it is so.

00:49:17.501 --> 00:49:22.626
Like Tao is the Kundalini. Tao as described, is also Kundalini.

00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:25.083
Zen system, Zen also means the same.

00:49:25.292 --> 00:49:27.125
Dhyana is the same thing.

00:49:27.334 --> 00:49:28.959
Confucious talked of the same thing,

00:49:29.125 --> 00:49:30.999
Socrates talked of the same thing.

00:49:31.167 --> 00:49:33.834
But only thing, is not said so clearly,

00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:37.000
because there were not people intelligent as you are today,

00:49:37.209 --> 00:49:40.709
to understand it, I think, that it was not said so clearly.

00:49:40.918 --> 00:49:45.083
Today we have so many seekers, can you imagine? So many seekers.

00:49:45.292 --> 00:49:46.834
The world is full of them.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.501
And they are intelligent, they have understood

00:49:50.709 --> 00:49:53.584
what is Divine, they try to understand.

00:49:53.792 --> 00:49:56.459
Is a very different category of people.

00:49:56.667 --> 00:50:00.334
As William Blake has said: “These are men of God”.

00:50:00.501 --> 00:50:04.209
They will find God and they will make others men of God.”

00:50:04.417 --> 00:50:06.626
It's very clearly he has said it hundred years back.

00:50:06.834 --> 00:50:08.083
So, that is what it is.

00:50:08.292 --> 00:50:11.042
And it is all, also in one of the Nadi Granthas,

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:15.792
which was written by Brighu Muni, who was the originator of

00:50:15.999 --> 00:50:19.667
the horoscopes and all that, astrology.

00:50:19.876 --> 00:50:22.417
He has written very clearly that this is going to happen

00:50:22.667 --> 00:50:24.876
and this year specially is something

00:50:25.042 --> 00:50:29.876
according to the calculations, seems to be a big explosion.

00:50:34.167 --> 00:50:37.292
It's just like that.

00:51:00.667 --> 00:51:04.501
Q: Even in somebody who is severely injured like in the spinal cord,

00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:06.459
can Kundalini be raised?

00:51:06.667 --> 00:51:09.999
SM: Yes can be. Can be, most of the people do get it.

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:13.334
If somebody has to much of problems then

00:51:13.501 --> 00:51:16.459
than it maybe that, it may little bit trouble,

00:51:16.667 --> 00:51:18.042
but one can correct it.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:22.250
It's, you see, the generosity of Divine is such,

00:51:22.459 --> 00:51:25.250
that He tries to give it to everyone.

00:51:25.459 --> 00:51:28.667
So much, that I'm Myself amazed.

00:51:28.918 --> 00:51:30.792
It doesn't consider anything else.

00:51:30.999 --> 00:51:33.999
Just like a big

00:51:36.209 --> 00:51:39.167
whirlwind it comes, just.

00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:43.292
I am Myself surprised how people get Realization.

00:51:44.417 --> 00:51:46.999
Where, like people,

00:51:47.167 --> 00:51:50.667
in Russia I was telling you yesterday. Then I went to Bogota.

00:51:50.876 --> 00:51:52.042
They have never heard about Me,

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.334
nothing of the kind, and thousands were there.

00:51:54.501 --> 00:51:57.209
They all got Realization. Very surprising.

00:51:57.417 --> 00:51:59.417
I was so surprised.

00:52:00.209 --> 00:52:02.417
It's something is there

00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:07.125
in the generosity of the Divine that it's working out.

00:52:07.417 --> 00:52:13.709
And is better that we all get drenched into that.

00:52:19.999 --> 00:52:25.083
All right. So we'll have the process of Realization.

00:52:25.918 --> 00:52:30.125
Just to remove your doubts, I talked to you and allowed you to

00:52:30.334 --> 00:52:33.667
ask Me questions and allowed lot of time for it,

00:52:33.876 --> 00:52:38.626
because you see, when you are going through that process

00:52:38.834 --> 00:52:41.501
I don’t want your mind just to come like a jack in the box,

00:52:41.709 --> 00:52:46.667
to say something. So is better to keep that mind little bit silent,

00:52:46.876 --> 00:52:49.083
I said, "All right, you can ask Me questions".

00:52:49.292 --> 00:52:52.125
But these questions, whether I answer them or not,

00:52:52.334 --> 00:52:54.292
or whether they satisfy you or not,

00:52:54.501 --> 00:52:56.999
whether you ask questions or not, makes no differences.

00:52:57.167 --> 00:52:59.250
Because this is all mental feats.

00:52:59.459 --> 00:53:02.167
It is beyond the mind, Kundalini takes you.

00:53:02.375 --> 00:53:05.584
So, what important thing is, that you must desire

00:53:05.792 --> 00:53:07.334
to get your Self-Realization.

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:08.999
If you do not desire it,

00:53:09.209 --> 00:53:11.459
if you do not want it, I cannot force on you.

00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:15.792
This is the biggest problem. You cannot force on anyone.

00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:18.834
You have to desire it and ask for it, humbly.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.417
If you are saying, that,

00:53:21.667 --> 00:53:24.292
"No, I won't have it". So, I would request you

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:27.334
that you better go and not disturb others.

00:53:27.584 --> 00:53:32.667
Because is something that cannot work against your free will.

00:53:33.292 --> 00:53:36.876
That’s the free choice, as you say. Is that is the free choice,

00:53:37.042 --> 00:53:40.083
that till that point, you have a free choice

00:53:40.292 --> 00:53:43.250
whether to ask for it or not.

00:53:44.334 --> 00:53:48.584
Now, there are two conditions, as I told yesterday.

00:53:49.167 --> 00:53:51.417
The first one is that,

00:53:51.667 --> 00:53:54.876
we have to forgive ourselves fully.

00:53:55.042 --> 00:53:58.167
We are not to feel guilty, at all.

00:53:58.375 --> 00:54:00.292
Absolutely, we are human beings,

00:54:00.501 --> 00:54:02.999
and human beings are the only ones who commit mistakes.

00:54:03.167 --> 00:54:05.709
Gods are not going to commit mistakes.

00:54:05.918 --> 00:54:09.792
So, if we commit mistakes, doesn’t matter.

00:54:10.209 --> 00:54:15.417
But as I told you, the generosity and the forgiveness

00:54:16.626 --> 00:54:18.792
of the Divine is so tremendous.

00:54:18.999 --> 00:54:23.375
that whatever you have done wrong, is easily forgiven.

00:54:24.167 --> 00:54:28.501
Divine is anxious that you should get your Realization.

00:54:29.292 --> 00:54:31.125
Very anxious.

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:34.250
So, you don’t now put down yourself,

00:54:34.459 --> 00:54:36.501
by saying, "I am guilty, I've done this,

00:54:36.709 --> 00:54:38.834
I've done that or I've committed sin.

00:54:38.999 --> 00:54:41.542
These ideas should not come into your head at all.

00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:44.959
There is nothing like sin, when you are in the present.

00:54:45.125 --> 00:54:48.959
So forget the past and forget what you think you have done wrong.

00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:53.626
Also you have to forgive the people, all the people, in general.

00:54:53.834 --> 00:54:56.709
Not to remember whom you have to forgive, why you have to forgive,

00:54:56.918 --> 00:54:58.792
but just in general you just forgive.

00:54:58.999 --> 00:55:01.626
It's such a great relief you don't know, if you will forgive.

00:55:01.876 --> 00:55:04.042
This Agnya chakra just releases.

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:07.292
If you just say, "I forgive everyone", it opens out,

00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:11.209
and it's so good, that once

00:55:11.417 --> 00:55:13.667
you have forgiven, then Kundalini just shoots off.

00:55:13.876 --> 00:55:17.167
But most of the time I have seen, when they come to Me, meet Me,

00:55:17.375 --> 00:55:19.626
Then I have to tell them, “Please forgive, please forgive,

00:55:19.834 --> 00:55:21.834
please forgive” and then it works out.

00:55:21.999 --> 00:55:26.626
It makes it easier, just you, just forgive everyone.

00:55:26.959 --> 00:55:29.417
As it is, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

00:55:29.667 --> 00:55:32.626
you don't do anything, do you? Nothing.

00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:36.292
What happens? It’s just a myth.

00:55:36.501 --> 00:55:39.042
Just a myth. But if you don’t forgive,

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:41.250
then you play into wrong hands.

00:55:41.626 --> 00:55:43.999
The other person, who has troubled you or tortured you

00:55:44.167 --> 00:55:45.918
is quite happy, but you are tortured,

00:55:46.083 --> 00:55:48.167
you are playing into the hands of such a person.

00:55:48.375 --> 00:55:50.042
So best thing is to forgive.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:53.667
Forgiveness is a very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:53.959 --> 00:55:57.751
So, I would request you to forgive everyone, before starting this.

00:55:57.959 --> 00:56:00.459
Is a very simple thing, which one has to do,

00:56:00.667 --> 00:56:03.667
is that we'll take out our shoes.

00:56:03.876 --> 00:56:07.959
Those who are upstairs, can come down, will be better.

00:56:23.417 --> 00:56:28.000
There are seats in front also, if some people want to come.

00:56:43.959 --> 00:56:46.667
All right?

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.542
Just put some water.

00:56:48.751 --> 00:56:52.250
Will you show them there? All right, just a minute.

00:56:57.626 --> 00:57:03.125
Just move down. There are some people who are waiting, to come in.

00:57:30.042 --> 00:57:33.834
Now, Frank will show you,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.626
how we are going to raise our own Kundalinis.

00:57:39.334 --> 00:57:41.959
It's very simple method

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:45.125
to understand, very simple.

00:57:45.334 --> 00:57:48.042
First of all, you put your left hand towards Me,

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:53.250
which represents your wish, your desire to get Self-Realization.

00:57:53.459 --> 00:57:56.501
Just please put it, left hand like that. Be comfortable.

00:57:56.751 --> 00:57:58.417
You need not sit with a slouch,

00:57:58.667 --> 00:58:01.042
you need not put with a very, too much straight.

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:04.209
Just simple.

00:58:05.417 --> 00:58:08.459
So, left hand, we put like this, and with the right hand

00:58:08.709 --> 00:58:10.999
we nourish our centers on the left hand side,

00:58:11.167 --> 00:58:13.459
nourish our centers on the left hand side.

00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:17.125
Put both the feet apart from each other.

00:58:18.292 --> 00:58:21.792
Now, put your right hand on your heart,

00:58:21.999 --> 00:58:25.876
because right hand stands for action, or the power of action.

00:58:26.083 --> 00:58:30.459
On the heart. Here resides the Spirit, as I told you.

00:58:30.918 --> 00:58:33.125
Then we have to put our right hand

00:58:33.334 --> 00:58:36.000
in the upper portion of our abdomen.

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.709
Just now, you see all this,

00:58:37.918 --> 00:58:41.459
and later on you will close your eyes and follow it.

00:58:42.626 --> 00:58:44.959
We have to work only on the left hand side.

00:58:45.125 --> 00:58:48.250
In the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left hand side.

00:58:48.584 --> 00:58:50.834
Then we take down our right hand

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.999
in the lower portion of our abdomen.

00:59:02.999 --> 00:59:06.584
This is the center which manifests

00:59:08.918 --> 00:59:13.167
the divinity on our central nervous system.

00:59:13.667 --> 00:59:19.792
That means we become knowledgeable, gnostics, the bodha.

00:59:21.167 --> 00:59:23.459
Now, you have to rise your hand in the upper portion

00:59:23.667 --> 00:59:25.209
of your abdomen.

00:59:25.417 --> 00:59:28.209
Now, this is the center,

00:59:28.417 --> 00:59:31.792
which is the center of mastery.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:39.292
Great saints, prophets, have created this special center for us,

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:42.792
so we have to enlighten this one also.

00:59:42.999 --> 00:59:47.417
Then we take our right hand on our heart.

00:59:49.999 --> 00:59:52.999
As I told you, this is the center of our Spirit.

00:59:53.417 --> 00:59:55.250
Then we take our hand

00:59:55.459 --> 00:59:58.918
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder,

00:59:59.083 --> 01:00:01.959
and put our right hand on the back side of it

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:04.125
and turn our head to our right.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:09.918
This is the center which is disturbed when we feel guilty.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:16.000
Then we take our right hand

01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:19.626
onto our forehead across,

01:00:19.876 --> 01:00:22.417
and push it down as much as we can.

01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:24.292
Allow the head to rest on it.

01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:28.250
Now press it on both the sides.

01:00:34.876 --> 01:00:38.626
This is the center to forgive others.

01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:43.459
Take down our hand. Take up on the back side

01:00:43.709 --> 01:00:49.792
of our head and put our head resting on it, upward.

01:00:51.626 --> 01:00:56.125
This is the center to ask for forgiveness from Divine,

01:00:56.334 --> 01:00:59.000
without feeling guilty.

01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:02.042
Then we stretch our hand,

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.999
we stretch our palm.

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:06.375
The center of our palm

01:01:06.584 --> 01:01:09.209
we put it

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:12.918
on the fontanel bone area.

01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:20.375
And bend our head, as much as we can.

01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:24.626
Now, push back your fingers. Please, push back your fingers,

01:01:24.834 --> 01:01:29.918
so there is a sufficient pressure on your scalp.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:34.501
And now you have to move your scalp seven times,

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.834
very slowly, clockwise.

01:02:01.209 --> 01:02:04.250
Now, it’s done.

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:07.709
That’s all we have to do.

01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:12.542
You can take out, take down your spectacles if you want,

01:02:12.751 --> 01:02:14.667
because sometimes even eyesight improves.

01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:16.626
And now you have to close your eyes.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:19.792
Untill I tell you please, don’t open them. Please, don’t open them.

01:02:19.999 --> 01:02:22.667
Remember to keep your feet apart from each other,

01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:25.834
and just this left hand like this.

01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:33.834
Like this, bend you head, push back your fingers,

01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:39.459
and move your scalp like this, seven times, slowly.

01:02:40.999 --> 01:02:43.000
This is important. You push back your fingers,

01:02:43.209 --> 01:02:46.834
then there is a pressure, and you can do it much better. All right?

01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:50.417
Now, let’s see.

01:02:52.959 --> 01:02:54.334
Please, close your eyes!

01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:56.792
But you should be pleasantly pleased towards yourself.

01:02:56.999 --> 01:02:58.959
You have to forgive yourself and you have to be

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:01.584
very pleasantly placed towards yourselves.

01:03:01.792 --> 01:03:04.999
Not to be angry with yourself, that is very important.

01:03:05.209 --> 01:03:07.334
Now, put your left hand towards Me

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:11.167
and right hand on your heart.

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:18.250
Close your eyes, please!

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:24.792
Here, you have to ask Me a question.

01:03:25.999 --> 01:03:28.876
As you ask a computer, you have to ask a question.

01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:33.501
You can call me Shri Mataji or you can call me Mother,

01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:36.209
”Mother, am I the Spirit?“

01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:38.751
Ask this question in your heart three times.

01:03:38.959 --> 01:03:41.083
Not loudly, in your heart,  three times,

01:03:41.292 --> 01:03:44.042
”Mother, am I the Spirit?“

01:03:44.375 --> 01:03:46.709
It's a very important question.

01:04:03.751 --> 01:04:05.584
Now,

01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:11.209
you take down your hand,

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:13.375
onto the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:16.250
on the left hand side and press it hard.

01:04:16.834 --> 01:04:20.876
If you are the Spirit, you are your master.

01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:25.751
So now ask another question to Me, three times, in your heart,

01:04:26.334 --> 01:04:28.999
”Mother,

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.292
am I my own master?

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.501
Mother, am I my own guru?”

01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:37.167
Ask this question three times.

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:02.918
As I've told you, I cannot

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:08.584
cross over your freedom, which I respect.

01:05:08.834 --> 01:05:12.209
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:05:12.417 --> 01:05:13.876
You have to ask for it.

01:05:14.042 --> 01:05:15.834
So, now, please, put your right hand

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.042
in the low portion of your abdomen,

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.876
on the left hand side.

01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:25.501
And ask

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.709
“Mother,

01:05:30.584 --> 01:05:32.751
please, give me pure knowledge!”

01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:37.375
Say it six times, because this center has got six petals.

01:05:37.626 --> 01:05:41.042
So please say, “Mother, please,

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:45.167
give Me pure knowledge”.

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:53.584
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:05:53.792 --> 01:05:57.459
there's movement in your Kundalini, which you may not feel.

01:05:57.667 --> 01:06:01.751
It's rising, so we have to

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:09.042
nourish the higher centers, with our self-confidence.

01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:14.792
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:17.334
in the left hand side, on the left hand side,

01:06:17.626 --> 01:06:22.501
and here you say with full confidence

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:25.626
ten times,

01:06:26.959 --> 01:06:30.834
“Mother, I am my own master“.

01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:32.751
It's very good

01:06:32.959 --> 01:06:37.417
for people who have been specially tortured by other gurus.

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:42.125
”Mother, I am my own master”. Please, say it ten times.

01:06:58.501 --> 01:07:02.125
So now, raise your right hand

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:14.792
onto your heart, where resides the Spirit.

01:07:14.999 --> 01:07:16.999
And the Spirit

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:22.876
is the state, to which you have to rise.

01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:27.167
With full confidence now, raising your hand

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:31.167
to your heart, with full confidence,

01:07:32.125 --> 01:07:33.999
you have to say,

01:07:34.209 --> 01:07:37.501
“Mother I am the Spirit.

01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:43.709
Mother, I am the Spirit”. Say it twelve times, please.

01:07:55.792 --> 01:07:59.083
The Divine is the ocean

01:07:59.292 --> 01:08:03.751
of knowledge and love.

01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:10.584
It is the ocean of bliss and peace,

01:08:10.999 --> 01:08:15.250
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:19.834
So you cannot do anything, which cannot be forgiven

01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:24.167
by that great power of forgiveness.

01:08:25.626 --> 01:08:28.167
So now, you raise your right hand

01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:30.667
in the corner of your neck

01:08:30.876 --> 01:08:32.918
and your shoulder,

01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:35.125
push it back as much as you can,

01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:38.209
and turn your head to your right.

01:08:39.999 --> 01:08:43.709
Here you have to say sixteen times,

01:08:43.918 --> 01:08:46.209
with full confidence,

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:48.834
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all”.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.792
Please, say it with full confidence.

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:07.125
I’ve already told you,

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:10.083
that whether we forgive someone

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:12.626
or don't forgive, we don't do anything.

01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:16.792
But if we don’t forgive, then we play into wrong hands.

01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:19.999
So, please, now,

01:09:20.334 --> 01:09:23.209
raise your hand to your forehead

01:09:26.876 --> 01:09:30.501
and put down your head, slowly.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.626
Let it rest on your hand

01:09:34.834 --> 01:09:38.292
and press it hard on both the sides.

01:09:40.999 --> 01:09:46.250
This is the center where we have to forgive everyone.

01:09:46.459 --> 01:09:49.709
So, please, say it from your heart,

01:09:49.999 --> 01:09:53.417
from your heart, not how many times,

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:58.250
“Mother, I forgive everyone”. Is very important!

01:09:58.459 --> 01:10:00.834
Please, say this, from your heart.

01:10:00.999 --> 01:10:02.834
Open your heart and say,

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:06.417
“Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:16.792
Now, take back your right hand

01:10:16.999 --> 01:10:19.876
on the back side of your head,

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:23.834
and turn in upward as far as possible.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.125
Let it rest on your hand.

01:10:28.999 --> 01:10:31.417
Here, without feeling guilty,

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:34.250
without counting your mistakes,

01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:37.375
without blaming yourselves for anything,

01:10:37.626 --> 01:10:39.834
just for your satisfaction,

01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:42.876
you have to say in your heart,

01:10:43.042 --> 01:10:46.584
opening your heart, not how many times,

01:10:46.834 --> 01:10:48.417
“Oh Divine,

01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:51.375
if I have done any mistake, please forgive me”.

01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:53.792
In humility you have to say,

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:59.000
“Oh, Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please, forgive me.”

01:11:10.751 --> 01:11:15.667
Now, stretch your palm, right hand palm,

01:11:15.876 --> 01:11:20.250
please, and put the center of your palm

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:24.709
on your fontanel bone area,

01:11:24.959 --> 01:11:27.876
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:31.999
Now, put down your head, as far as possible.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:36.584
Now press it hard, push back your fingers nicely,

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.125
press it hard

01:11:38.334 --> 01:11:42.417
and you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise.

01:11:42.626 --> 01:11:49.125
But again, here, I cannot cross over your freedom,

01:11:49.334 --> 01:11:50.876
which I respect.

01:11:51.042 --> 01:11:53.792
So, you will have to say,

01:11:53.999 --> 01:11:57.292
“Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization”.

01:11:57.584 --> 01:12:01.042
I cannot force on you. Please, say it seven times,

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:05.584
“Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization!”

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.209
Push back your fingers please, push back your fingers. Move it.

01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:15.334
Put down your heads. Put down your heads.

01:12:41.999 --> 01:12:44.375
Now, please, take
down your hands.

01:12:44.584 --> 01:12:46.626
Open your eyes, slowly.

01:12:46.834 --> 01:12:50.834
Put the hands towards Me, like this.

01:12:51.999 --> 01:12:54.751
Now, put down,

01:12:54.959 --> 01:12:57.834
push your hand, right hand like this towards Me,

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.792
and put down your head,

01:12:59.999 --> 01:13:02.000
and see for yourself with the left hand,

01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:04.959
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:06.918
May be little hot, doesn’t matter.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:10.542
But it will be some sort of a heat or a cool

01:13:10.751 --> 01:13:13.125
coming out of your head.

01:13:13.334 --> 01:13:16.584
You have to certify yourself.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.209
Don’t worry about the air conditioning.

01:13:19.417 --> 01:13:20.959
It's coming out of your head.

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:23.667
Now, put the left hand towards Me

01:13:23.876 --> 01:13:26.000
and put your right and again

01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:27.584
and see for yourself,

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:31.876
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:40.501
Now change over again, once more.

01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:44.959
Put the right hand towards Me and put down your head,

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:48.834
and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze,

01:13:49.083 --> 01:13:53.083
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:56.209
You have to put it above, not on it.

01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:59.584
Above, some people can have it

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:03.042
little far away, some will have it closer.

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:07.167
But you don’t have to touch your head.

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:11.667
Now,

01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:14.709
push back both your hands.

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:18.250
Raise them, raise them like this.

01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:21.792
Push back your head,

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.834
and ask the question,

01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:29.083
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:33.876
"Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of God’s love?"

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:36.000
"Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

01:14:36.209 --> 01:14:40.083
Ask this question, one of them, three times.

01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:45.292
Keep your eyes upward and ask this question.

01:14:52.959 --> 01:14:55.751
Now, take down your hands.

01:14:56.584 --> 01:14:59.292
Just keep them.

01:14:59.584 --> 01:15:03.083
Try to watch Me without thinking. You can do it.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.667
You feel very relaxed.

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:08.918
You can put on your glasses, if you like.

01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:17.125
Just put your hands towards Me like this.

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:24.375
Those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head

01:15:24.626 --> 01:15:28.626
or on their fingertips, whether hot or cold,

01:15:28.834 --> 01:15:31.751
please, raise both your hands.

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:40.584
Practically, all of you have felt it.

01:15:40.959 --> 01:15:43.999
May God bless you! Just imagine!

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:49.792
I bow to all the saints.

01:15:49.999 --> 01:15:54.876
Now, you have to just know how to establish it

01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:58.334
and to work it out. It's very simple.

01:15:58.584 --> 01:16:00.834
You have a very good center here,

01:16:00.999 --> 01:16:04.501
where people will tell you all about it.

01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:06.626
There is nothing to be paid for,

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:09.250
just you have to give little time to yourself

01:16:09.459 --> 01:16:13.250
and you must respect your Self-Realization.

01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:17.209
Gradually, you will grow into it. And I hope next year,

01:16:17.417 --> 01:16:20.959
I will see you here as big trees grown.

01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:22.999
Very happy to meet you all.

01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:25.459
All those who have not felt it

01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:28.999
can come on one side and the Sahaja Yogis can see them;

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:34.250
And those who have felt it, I would like to meet them, one by one.

01:16:35.584 --> 01:16:38.292
I’d like to shake hands.

01:16:48.667 --> 01:16:51.292
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:16:51.876 --> 01:16:53.792
SM: So now...
P:  [unclear] Mother, is lovely.

01:16:53.999 --> 01:16:56.999
SM: Lovely. Now, you are lovely, you are fantastic,

01:16:57.167 --> 01:16:59.792
and now you have to establish it. You must establish,

01:16:59.999 --> 01:17:02.792
give some time. All right? Don't neglect it,

01:17:02.999 --> 01:17:04.667
because, unless and until you establish it,

01:17:04.876 --> 01:17:06.417
you cannot become the master of it.

01:17:06.626 --> 01:17:09.751
And it takes at the most one month, just to establish it.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.959
All right? So you meet these people.

01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:13.834
Where is the center, you just announce.

01:17:13.999 --> 01:17:16.626
Lovely. Thank you, you help us.

01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:23.834
So, you got it?

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:27.751
So you really got, really got it.

01:17:28.876 --> 01:17:31.999
Oh, he's very cool and nice.

01:17:38.959 --> 01:17:42.709
May God bless you! It’s your own, it’s your own.

01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:49.834
Now, you must enjoy yourself more,

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:52.709
by becoming that fully, all right? You have to become fully.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.584
You don’t have to do much about it,

01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:56.125
just to know something, that’s all.

01:17:56.334 --> 01:17:58.417
P: Yes. Thank you very much!

01:18:04.626 --> 01:18:07.209
It’s all your own, you are what you are!

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:10.209
This is the glory you are! Just enjoy yourself.

01:18:10.459 --> 01:18:13.459
All right? So, very good.

01:18:14.792 --> 01:18:16.959
May God bless you!

01:18:21.417 --> 01:18:23.999
Thank you, for what? It's your own.

01:18:24.292 --> 01:18:27.834
You enjoy yourself. Just laugh it out. You found it.

01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:30.709
That's all, you found it. Eureka!

01:18:33.999 --> 01:18:35.375
P: You told me what I wanted to hear.

01:18:35.584 --> 01:18:38.125
SM: Really? Good, I am very happy!

01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:41.876
Very good, excellent. May God bless you!

01:18:49.626 --> 01:18:51.334
So cool and nice!

01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:53.999
Wonderful. May God bless you!

01:18:54.209 --> 01:18:56.334
Enjoy yourself.

01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:01.959
P: Thank you very much!
SM: May God bless you.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:04.417
Thank you, for what? You are, it's your own.

01:19:04.626 --> 01:19:07.751
[Actually] I must I thank you for getting your own.

01:19:07.999 --> 01:19:10.876
May God bless you! May God bless you!

01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:14.417
P: Thank You for Your [unclear].

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:16.250
SM: Come along!

01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:18.999
P: Thank You, Mother!
SM: May God bless you!

01:19:19.501 --> 01:19:22.751
They are such a beautiful people! May God bless you!

01:19:24.167 --> 01:19:25.876
So this is finished now?

01:19:26.042 --> 01:19:27.834
If You are bored You can just throw it away.

01:19:27.999 --> 01:19:30.876
All right. It's all right. I know I told you it's not true.

01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:33.751
May God bless you!

01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:46.167
P: Thank You for Your time and goodness.

01:19:46.375 --> 01:19:48.751
May God bless you. Now you must give some time to yourself.

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:50.375
That's important, isn't it?

01:19:50.584 --> 01:19:53.584
Yes, you should, you should look after yourself.

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:57.792
No more troubles, no more diseases, no more doctors.

01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:03.751
May God bless you!

01:20:03.959 --> 01:20:05.834
SM: Yes, just come!
P: I'll have to.

01:20:05.999 --> 01:20:09.000
Yes, yes. They have. We have a tour in India,

01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:12.417
we too have a tour. So, if you want to come,

01:20:12.667 --> 01:20:15.000
you can find out from these people.

01:20:24.334 --> 01:20:26.876
Oh, God! Good.

01:20:27.999 --> 01:20:29.876
May God bless you!

01:20:32.751 --> 01:20:35.959
Enjoy yourself, enjoy. Enjoy.

01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:40.834
But you must come and see them and find out. All right?

01:20:40.999 --> 01:20:42.999
And become experts.

01:20:48.999 --> 01:20:50.999
May God bless you!

01:20:59.918 --> 01:21:02.334
When I put my hand up the first time, I felt it.

01:21:02.501 --> 01:21:05.751
and when I took it away it had gone. Is that fine?

01:21:06.459 --> 01:21:09.083
You know, when I put it up, I felt it, right?

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:11.042
and it [unclear].

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.792
And then when I put it back it was gone. What had happen?

01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:16.209
It doesn't stay if you are thinking about it! Just don't think.

01:21:16.417 --> 01:21:18.834
You should not think about it and argue about it

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:21.626
or discuss about it. Then you come to your mental level.

01:21:21.834 --> 01:21:23.876
It is higher level than that, that’s why you lost it.

01:21:24.042 --> 01:21:26.125
Now, don’t think about it, you can’t think about it.

01:21:26.334 --> 01:21:28.876
You see, you did it without thinking.

01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:30.876
So keep to that state.

01:21:31.042 --> 01:21:32.834
Thank You.

01:21:32.999 --> 01:21:35.834
P: Namaste Mother. Forgive me.

01:21:37.334 --> 01:21:42.250
[Hindi]

01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:44.292
[Hindi]

01:21:44.501 --> 01:21:48.292
[Hindi]

01:21:49.167 --> 01:21:52.626
[Hindi]

01:21:53.584 --> 01:21:55.667
Namaste!
Namaste!

01:21:55.876 --> 01:21:57.918
It's good to see You again!

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:00.292
P: I sort tried to forgive the [unclear].

01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:03.999
Sort tried to forgive the [unclear] as You told me last time.

01:22:04.167 --> 01:22:05.999
SM: Forgive?
P:The [unclear].

01:22:06.292 --> 01:22:09.959
The white man, he and his [unclear]. For marrying, You were saying.

01:22:11.751 --> 01:22:13.584
P: Thank you I hope we are a forest

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:15.167
of tall trees next time You visit.

01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:18.918
SM: Yes, we have to see. Is already described that.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:22.125
And there's a poem that: “Come along the forest

01:22:22.334 --> 01:22:24.584
of [great] trees of giving blessing. Like that.

01:22:24.792 --> 01:22:27.459
There's a Marathi poem like that describing you all,

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:30.334
as the oceans of love,

01:22:30.501 --> 01:22:32.125
which speak.

01:22:32.334 --> 01:22:35.375
Beautiful descriptions, there is about you, people.

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:41.667
P: I was wondering, we used [unclear] woman,

01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:43.876
not to shake hands but just
kiss them on the cheek.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:46.999
SM: All right. It is all right. You are My son.

01:22:49.459 --> 01:22:52.334
SM: You are My child.
P: We actually try and tell other people.

01:22:52.584 --> 01:22:54.876
SM: Please do, please do and bring them along.

01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:57.167
We have a center here, luckily, very good center,

01:22:57.375 --> 01:22:58.375
which we work it on.

01:22:58.584 --> 01:23:01.501
I had a friend, he was very closed to a

01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:03.042
one of the seekers who...

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:05.584
Yes. There are so many. There are so many lost.

01:23:05.792 --> 01:23:07.876
[unclear] incarnation but that is part of...

01:23:08.042 --> 01:23:10.459
Yes, that is there. It's a part of it.

01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:12.709
They'll tell you all about it. All right?

01:23:12.959 --> 01:23:15.667
SM: So, now, are you all right?
P: Yes, thank you.

01:23:17.417 --> 01:23:21.000
Please [unclear] from forty years old and I believe

01:23:21.209 --> 01:23:24.626
by next time when I see you [unclear] my life

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:28.167
I'm forty years old and I believe next year when I see You

01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:31.999
[unclear]

01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:36.000
Of course, they can, of course. May God bless you!

01:23:39.417 --> 01:23:41.792
May God bless you!

01:23:43.792 --> 01:23:45.999

P:Thank you very much!
SM: May God bless you!

01:24:13.876 --> 01:24:15.792
SM: You come from Fiji?
P: South Africa.

01:24:15.999 --> 01:24:20.334
South Africa, really? We have somebody from South Africa here.

01:24:23.042 --> 01:24:27.375
We are having a nice center there in South Africa, so many.

01:24:27.918 --> 01:24:30.999
At least they were saying about one thousand people in South Africa

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:33.751
doing Sahaja Yoga. It's very good.

01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:38.459
Enjoy yourself now.

01:24:41.417 --> 01:24:42.918
You are also from South Africa?

01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:45.125
P: No, I am from New Zealand, my mother...

01:24:45.334 --> 01:24:48.083
I'm from, born in New Zealand and my mother is from Gujarat,

01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:50.209
so she stays in India.

01:24:50.876 --> 01:24:53.999
P: Gujarat and stays in India.
SM: Oh I see, Gujarat.

01:24:54.167 --> 01:24:56.417
Oh, Gujarat also we are doing very well.

01:24:56.667 --> 01:24:58.999
P: Yes, but I am in New Zealand.

01:25:03.667 --> 01:25:06.999
P: I've asked to be guided for many years for the right teacher.

01:25:07.167 --> 01:25:09.667
I've asked for many years to be guided

01:25:09.876 --> 01:25:12.626
to the right teacher and I feel I've got it now.

01:25:12.876 --> 01:25:15.918
SM: Now, there are people who will make you a teacher yourself.

01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:18.792
And you should get it more people. You are from India?

01:25:18.999 --> 01:25:21.834
P: Yes, well I am born here.
SM: Yes, you are born here, doesn't matter.

01:25:21.999 --> 01:25:23.709
There are so many Indians here.

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.834
And please tell them that the time has come for them

01:25:25.999 --> 01:25:27.918
to get what is promised. All right?

01:25:28.083 --> 01:25:30.918
Yes. [unclear]

01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:35.334
SM: You are from where?
P: I'm from South Africa.

01:25:35.918 --> 01:25:38.375
Really? We have somebody here from South Africa.

01:25:38.584 --> 01:25:41.042
Yes, that was my wife [unclear].
SM: Maharaj is there.

01:25:41.834 --> 01:25:42.626
May God bless you.

01:25:42.834 --> 01:25:45.083
And we are doing very well in South Africa, surprisingly.

01:25:45.292 --> 01:25:48.000
There are thousand people who are Sahaja Yogis now in South Africa.

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:50.834
P: Which part of South Africa? SM:I don’t know exactly.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.417
I won't be able to tell you but if you want

01:25:52.626 --> 01:25:53.999
I'll give you the address of those people.

01:25:54.167 --> 01:25:56.626
P: Yes, but I’m living here now, permanently, in New Zealand.

01:25:56.834 --> 01:26:00.167
P: Thank you very much. I leave you.
SM: So may God bless you!

01:26:00.375 --> 01:26:02.250
P: It's beautiful!
SM: Enjoy.

01:26:02.501 --> 01:26:05.292
You are all beautiful. You just know your own beauty now.

01:26:05.501 --> 01:26:08.584
It’s time for you to know your beauty and glory.

01:26:09.334 --> 01:26:11.999
So, now, how are you?

01:26:16.834 --> 01:26:20.000
Now, you are all seekers, you see? It’s your right to get it.

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:22.999
All right? It’s your right to get it.

01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:25.999
Here's another one, a great seeker here.

01:26:27.167 --> 01:26:28.751
May God bless you!

01:26:28.959 --> 01:26:30.667
P: I've always been interested in Kundalini.

01:26:30.876 --> 01:26:34.501
SM: Now, you have it. It's under your control. You can raise it,

01:26:34.751 --> 01:26:37.918
to anybody if you want to. Got it.

01:26:41.999 --> 01:26:45.334
P:What I want to know, is why didn't I want to seek a long time ago?

01:26:45.751 --> 01:26:48.999
Why didn't I want to seek a long time ago?

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:52.667
Why now? I can't understand that.

01:26:52.918 --> 01:26:56.501
SM: I'm sorry for that. I know but

01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:59.334
it is the time, has to come.

01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:01.125
It has to ripe.

01:27:01.334 --> 01:27:04.709
I was here many times before,

01:27:05.042 --> 01:27:08.375
three times before I've been here, in New Zealand.

01:27:08.584 --> 01:27:11.250
SM: I’ll come back again next year.
P: We need you.

01:27:11.999 --> 01:27:15.709
Now, you meet them, and become the full, right?

01:27:18.999 --> 01:27:22.626
What a question! But that's true. Some people take time.

01:27:22.876 --> 01:27:27.501
Isn't it? Because I've been here before also, for your information.

01:27:31.876 --> 01:27:35.042
P: I got a question. I felt the heat in my left hand

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:38.292
SM: You come from what place?

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:40.751
SM: You come from which place?
P: From Singapore.

01:27:40.959 --> 01:27:42.999
SM: From Singapore with the left hand side?

01:27:43.167 --> 01:27:45.834
P: With my left hand, you know I did not feel anything.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.834
SM: Left hand couldn't feel anything.
P: Right hand couldn't feel anything.

01:27:47.999 --> 01:27:51.999
SM: All right, so you forgive. Singapore is a very speedy people.

01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:57.292
And now, you forgive anything? See now?

01:27:58.959 --> 01:28:01.292
All right? You have to forgive.

01:28:02.125 --> 01:28:04.250
Thank you. It was beautiful.

01:28:04.459 --> 01:28:07.834
So beautiful you are. Enjoy your own beauty.

01:28:08.459 --> 01:28:10.334
You are all so beautiful people.

01:28:10.584 --> 01:28:14.375
Aren't you ike flowers? Very nice to meet you.

01:28:14.876 --> 01:28:17.417
Very nice to meet you.

01:28:22.792 --> 01:28:25.709
[Hindi]

01:28:25.918 --> 01:28:28.209
[Hindi]

01:28:28.501 --> 01:28:31.959
[Hindi]

01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:33.209
Just Imagine!

01:28:33.459 --> 01:28:36.167
That gentleman, just call him; that why he's feeling hot.

01:28:36.999 --> 01:28:39.334
Hello. Call your son. I'll tell him.

01:28:40.501 --> 01:28:42.334
[Hindi]

01:28:42.501 --> 01:28:43.459
He has gone and this is my son.

01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:45.999
All right. So that's the thing. That's wrong.

01:28:46.209 --> 01:28:49.000
That’s why you and he, both are feeling hot.

01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:51.417
All right? He is not a right person.

01:28:51.751 --> 01:28:53.999
You want diamonds or you want God?

01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:55.250
P: God.

01:28:55.459 --> 01:28:58.667
It's all right. Then, give him up.

01:29:01.417 --> 01:29:03.459
SM: You are from where?
P: Fiji.

01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:06.167
SM: Fiji? There are lots of Fiji people here.

01:29:06.417 --> 01:29:09.042
[Hindi]

01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:12.083
[Hindi]

01:29:12.626 --> 01:29:16.083
[Hindi]

01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:19.876
[Hindi]

01:29:20.042 --> 01:29:23.083
[Hindi]

01:29:23.292 --> 01:29:27.167
[hindi]

01:29:28.584 --> 01:29:32.083
[Hindi]

01:29:32.292 --> 01:29:33.667
[Hindi]

01:29:33.876 --> 01:29:35.999
Do You think I should go there and [unclear].

01:29:36.167 --> 01:29:37.918
SM: Where ? P: Over there.

01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:40.709
SM: Of course, of course.

01:29:42.167 --> 01:29:46.250
[Jane Lee] In the process I felt something here and afterwards.

01:29:46.459 --> 01:29:49.999
SM: Liver. You didn't forgive my child. You have to forgive.

01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:53.959
That's something I've been requested you all. Just forgive.

01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:57.709
That's why you felt it there. Now is better?

01:30:00.042 --> 01:30:01.626
All right? Got it.

01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:05.834
So there's only little thing you didn't do, is to forgive.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.999
Thank You.

01:30:10.209 --> 01:30:12.876
SM: How are you?
P: My son has previously [unclear]

again, You want again to go? [unclear]

01:30:16.751 --> 01:30:20.876
I wish I could go sometimes to all these places. May God bless you.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:23.918
So now...

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:29.125
You got it very well? Isn't it ? Feel it?

01:30:29.417 --> 01:30:32.918
Yes, yes. I can see on your face. The eyes are dilatated.

01:30:33.083 --> 01:30:35.125
There's a sparkle in the eyes when you get your Realization.

01:30:35.334 --> 01:30:38.167
P: Before I came in, I had warm from my hands anyway.

01:30:38.375 --> 01:30:40.167
SM: And now is good.

01:30:40.375 --> 01:30:42.834
Yes, that's correct.

01:30:42.999 --> 01:30:45.375
I'm still trying to feel it correctly.

01:30:45.584 --> 01:30:48.000
Yes, you should. You should try to meet these people

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:49.626
and just establish yourself.

01:30:49.834 --> 01:30:53.626
P: My mother is member of your group, and so is Katrina.

01:30:53.918 --> 01:30:55.667
SM: Really?
P: She’s my daughter.

01:30:55.876 --> 01:30:58.751
Oh, good, very nice.

01:31:00.167 --> 01:31:01.959
SM: Hello sir. P: Nice to meet you.

01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:04.417
May God bless you.

01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:06.125
Nice to meet you!

01:31:06.334 --> 01:31:08.125
P: When do You come to New Zealand again?

01:31:08.334 --> 01:31:10.334
SM: Next year?
P: Next year.

01:31:15.999 --> 01:31:18.542
[Hindi]

01:31:18.751 --> 01:31:21.667
[Hindi]

01:31:23.083 --> 01:31:26.167
[Hindi]

01:31:26.375 --> 01:31:28.125
P: Thank you very much.
SM: May God bless you!

01:31:28.334 --> 01:31:31.959
So, now, it is all right.
P: It was very nice to receive

01:31:32.125 --> 01:31:35.167
Your powerful talks. Thank You!

01:31:35.375 --> 01:31:38.417
SM: It is power of Love, my child, it is just power of Love.

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.501
Nothing more than that. All right?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
May God bless you!

01:31:43.501 --> 01:31:46.417
Thank You very much. It was lovely. And now is available.

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:48.709
I don't know what I felt [unclear].

01:31:48.918 --> 01:31:51.667
Now, you must forgive, that is the point, you see.

01:31:51.876 --> 01:31:53.542
If you don’t forgive, you won’t feel it.

01:31:53.751 --> 01:31:55.626
You have to forgive from your heart.

01:31:55.834 --> 01:31:59.083
Just now, you see? Better?

01:31:59.459 --> 01:32:01.918
P: Yes, yes.
SM: You have to forgive.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.417
P: Yes, thank You.

01:32:03.626 --> 01:32:06.042
SM: That's the only thing you have to do is to forgive.

01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:07.834
It's a bit too much now. How are you?

01:32:07.999 --> 01:32:09.584
Thank You for an interesting talk.

01:32:09.792 --> 01:32:11.751
Now, you must come and see them, all right?

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:15.626
And achieve it and get boys of your age group. Very important!

01:32:15.834 --> 01:32:18.167
You know there's an attack, a negative attack .

01:32:18.375 --> 01:32:19.918
coming to your country. You must know that.

01:32:20.083 --> 01:32:22.334
Drugs, this, that, all kinds of things.

01:32:22.584 --> 01:32:25.667
P: Thank You very much. It was lovely. Thank You.

01:32:32.292 --> 01:32:34.459
P: You'll help me to help myself?

01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:36.792
SM: Yes, you will. You just go and see them.

01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:40.918
SM: You will help yourself and you help others also.

01:32:44.167 --> 01:32:46.709
[unclear]

01:32:46.918 --> 01:32:49.459
Hot. You must forgive, just forgive.

01:32:49.834 --> 01:32:53.792
Forgive. Is important to forgive.

01:32:55.375 --> 01:32:57.334
Just forgive!

01:32:57.792 --> 01:32:59.792
Better?

01:33:03.999 --> 01:33:06.834
SM: You are from where?
P: I'm from New Zealand.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.876
SM: From where.
P: New Zealand. I'm from India.

01:33:10.042 --> 01:33:11.709
SM: From where? P: From Bombay.

01:33:11.918 --> 01:33:13.167
SM: From Bombay?

01:33:13.375 --> 01:33:15.000
P: But I've been here long time.

01:33:15.209 --> 01:33:17.876
I have come when I was ten and I've been here 40 years now.

01:33:18.042 --> 01:33:21.667
SM: Really?
P: Yes, but I have problems with my own children.

01:33:21.876 --> 01:33:24.626
SM: They will be all right. Now you first of all learn all these things.

01:33:24.834 --> 01:33:26.667
Yes. Then you can solve all the problems.

01:33:26.876 --> 01:33:29.751
First you learn it, you become a master and then you can manage.

01:33:29.959 --> 01:33:31.584
All right? May God Bless you.

01:33:31.792 --> 01:33:34.167
P: That's my daughter.
SM: How are you?

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:37.709
All right! You're all right. Forgive!

01:33:38.292 --> 01:33:40.501
Just you forgive!

01:33:41.334 --> 01:33:43.626
What is there at such a young age you don’t forgive?

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:46.918
You must forgive now. Even the old people have forgiven.

01:33:47.083 --> 01:33:48.709
Right?

01:33:48.918 --> 01:33:50.709
Now better.

01:33:50.918 --> 01:33:53.167
All right?

01:33:53.792 --> 01:33:56.626
P: Thank you.
SM: Go and see them.

01:33:56.834 --> 01:33:59.959
P: Thank you! We saw You in two classes in London

01:34:00.125 --> 01:34:01.999
and to see You here is a wonderful thing.

01:34:02.167 --> 01:34:04.000
SM: Really? When was that?

01:34:04.209 --> 01:34:07.626
P: I don't know, we just attended two of your two classes in London.

01:34:07.834 --> 01:34:09.334
SM: Oh, I see, the courses.

01:34:09.501 --> 01:34:11.250
P: And the course is in Wimbledon.

01:34:11.459 --> 01:34:13.375
SM: This, just see,

01:34:13.584 --> 01:34:16.042
he has attended the courses in Wimbledon, he says.

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:17.501
Yes, good.

01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:20.709
P: So thank you for this marvelous gift and also Your coming.

01:34:20.918 --> 01:34:23.999
SM: Very good. Now you go and meet them. You are here or in London?

01:34:24.167 --> 01:34:26.918
P: We are living here.
SM: All right, that's very good.

01:34:27.083 --> 01:34:28.999
P: I've been enjoying listening to You.

01:34:29.167 --> 01:34:31.542
I was very interested as I have breast cancer.

01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:32.959
P: That's why I was interested to hear

01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:34.584
what You said about breast cancer.

01:34:34.792 --> 01:34:36.834
SM: Was that the reason?
P: Yes.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.626
P: What was that?
SM: Is that the reason, you are insecure?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.334
P: Yes, yes, there's nothing. I always think that You say it. Yes.

01:34:44.918 --> 01:34:48.709
SM: You have seen that?
P: No, no that's leaving me now.

01:34:48.918 --> 01:34:50.334
SM: Now it's all right. You'll be all right.

01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:51.959
Is that the reason?
P: Yes it is.

01:34:52.125 --> 01:34:54.459
It is the reason. That’s why in the West,

01:34:54.667 --> 01:34:57.918
see women are very insecure. And men must understand this,

01:34:58.083 --> 01:35:01.834
the way they go on with this woman, that woman.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.999
P: I don't, I believe that I can’t expect him to understand,

01:35:06.209 --> 01:35:08.834
but I understand it myself now and that's important.

01:35:08.999 --> 01:35:12.584
SM: It is better to be yourself. See that the whole joy is with you.

01:35:12.792 --> 01:35:15.999
P: Yes, I'll try. I understand that. Thank you.

01:35:19.417 --> 01:35:21.999
SM: So, now, how are you?
P: Very good. Thank You, Mother.

01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:24.999
You, great!

01:35:27.751 --> 01:35:29.459
Now you must develop it within yourself.

01:35:29.667 --> 01:35:31.375
So develop it. You become a master of it.

01:35:31.626 --> 01:35:33.542
It is very easy, it's very simple.

01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:36.501
Because is so innate within you so you just become that.

01:35:36.751 --> 01:35:39.959
But you must know how to manage it, how to give Realization,

01:35:40.125 --> 01:35:42.792
so you can help so many people.

01:35:45.751 --> 01:35:50.125
So how are you? Oh you, very good. Wonderful.

01:35:50.334 --> 01:35:53.501
P: What is there?
SM: You will see, the cool.

01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:59.709
SM: So, how are you?
P: I don't [put in] to understand.

01:35:59.918 --> 01:36:02.999
All right, now, that's a [unclear]. Did you forgive?

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:06.334
SM: Did you forgive everyone?
P: Yes.

01:36:06.584 --> 01:36:09.000
Really? No, you did not. Now forgive.

01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:12.459
Now forgive, before Me you better forgive. Forgive, forgive.

01:36:15.584 --> 01:36:17.959
Now,

01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:20.584
is there a cool breeze now?

01:36:20.792 --> 01:36:22.584
Now, you didn't forgive. Just forgive.

01:36:22.792 --> 01:36:25.626
Just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".  Just say that.

01:36:25.834 --> 01:36:28.999
Say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:36:34.876 --> 01:36:37.083
All right?

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:39.584
It's releasing now?

01:36:39.792 --> 01:36:41.667
Such a headache is over if you forgive.

01:36:41.876 --> 01:36:45.626
Why to carry this headache of not forgiving?

01:36:45.834 --> 01:36:47.459
Now, see?

01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:49.918
May God bless you!

01:36:51.125 --> 01:36:53.999
SM: So, how are you?
P: Good, good.

01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:58.709
SM: Please, forgive.
P: I got it stronger in one hand than in the other.

01:36:58.918 --> 01:37:02.501
SM: In this hand you had strong? Yes. What work you do?

01:37:02.999 --> 01:37:05.667
Brick liner. Brick liner.

01:37:05.876 --> 01:37:07.667
P: Brick liner.
SM: I didn't understand.

01:37:07.876 --> 01:37:10.292
P: Brick liner.
SM: Brick layer, brick layer.

01:37:10.667 --> 01:37:14.250
That’s a physical work. That’s why.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:22.209
Now, it's better now?

01:37:23.501 --> 01:37:26.000
May God bless you! Little, one goes into imbalance,

01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:28.042
because you are doing a physical work.

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:31.209
The left is less. So they will teach you how to get into balance.

01:37:31.292 --> 01:37:34.501
That's all. All right? May God bless you!
