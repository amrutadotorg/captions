19900314 2nd Public Program, Auckland, New Zealand

00:02.250 --> 00:07.250
For example, we work very hard, think too hard, you are right sided;

00:07.459 --> 00:09.792
to compensate for it,

00:09.999 --> 00:12.834
we take , say,

00:12.999 --> 00:16.042
slipping pills or may be drinks, or something like that,

00:16.250 --> 00:18.792
just to compensate. We can’t bear it,

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
too much on the right.

00:21.167 --> 00:24.083
But that doesn’t give you help, because you swing

00:24.292 --> 00:26.876
from one end to another.

00:29.417 --> 00:33.334
So, in the center you have to move,

00:33.667 --> 00:37.584
and for that, there is a special mechanism within us.

00:37.792 --> 00:41.584
As I told you yesterday, you have to have a very

00:42.042 --> 00:45.626
scientific outlook, is to keep your mind open.

00:45.834 --> 00:48.959
If it works out, you have to accept as honest people.

00:49.501 --> 00:52.792
We say we are skeptical. All right, but

00:52.999 --> 00:55.959
we can keep ourselves open about it,

00:56.125 --> 01:00.292
that, afterall, we have not reached the absolute truth.

01:00.999 --> 01:05.083
So, if you have to reach that truth, what should happen to us?

01:05.375 --> 01:10.334
Maybe this is more known to the people in India, maybe,

01:10.501 --> 01:15.167
because of their discoveries in the inner world.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.667
But has to be known, even in the West, because,

01:18.876 --> 01:21.042
as I told you yesterday, that the tree

01:21.250 --> 01:23.209
which has grown so big,

01:23.417 --> 01:25.834
has to know his roots.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.209
Otherwise there is always a problem,

01:28.417 --> 01:31.876
which you don’t know how to face.

01:32.501 --> 01:35.250
So, as I have been told you about the roots, now,

01:35.459 --> 01:38.417
about the left side and the right side,

01:38.667 --> 01:40.876
the two sympathetic nervous system,

01:41.042 --> 01:43.083
the left and the right,

01:43.292 --> 01:45.709
both of them act separately,

01:45.918 --> 01:48.709
which I think doctors do not know about.

01:48.999 --> 01:53.000
About diabetes, now

01:57.959 --> 02:01.000
- it's too much talking on Me, imbalance -

02:01.999 --> 02:05.751
about diabetes somebody asked Me today,

02:06.083 --> 02:09.709
how does he get diabetes by thinking.

02:11.667 --> 02:14.834
In India, if you go to a village,

02:21.751 --> 02:25.792
they’ll ask you to take some tea and you just can’t take it,

02:25.999 --> 02:29.999
because the sugar is so much, that the

02:30.459 --> 02:33.834
spoon has to stand at right angle.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
And none of them get diabetes, none of them.

02:37.209 --> 02:40.459
But our bureaucrats in India, all of them get it.

02:40.876 --> 02:43.292
Also the politicians.

02:44.918 --> 02:49.209
The reason is, they think too much, they plan too much.

02:49.626 --> 02:51.626
They are very right sided. Now,

02:51.834 --> 02:53.626
which center does the right side work,

02:53.876 --> 02:57.042
is the second center, which we call as Swadisthan.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.584
This second center, which is the Swadisthan,

03:00.792 --> 03:04.459
is, as you can see very clearly,

03:05.334 --> 03:08.083
provides for right side activity.

03:08.292 --> 03:13.209
It is connected, upward passes through the optic chiasma,

03:13.417 --> 03:16.751
goes to the left side,

03:16.959 --> 03:19.125
creating our ego.

03:19.334 --> 03:23.999
Like you build this big hall,

03:24.167 --> 03:27.792
so believe that you have done a great job.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.626
But actually, something that was dead,

03:30.834 --> 03:34.042
that we have put together, that`s how hall is build.

03:34.250 --> 03:38.501
From dead to dead. We have done no living work so far.

03:39.083 --> 03:42.834
But that creates an imaginary feeling

03:42.999 --> 03:45.083
that we have done this, we have done that.

03:45.292 --> 03:50.501
And that's how this balloon of ego starts growing within us,

03:50.709 --> 03:53.584
on one side.

03:54.709 --> 03:59.042
Now, when this Swadisthan is working,

03:59.250 --> 04:04.709
it has got a very important work to do, is to

04:07.042 --> 04:11.792
replace the brain’s cells in our head,

04:11.999 --> 04:14.626
which we are using for thinking,

04:14.918 --> 04:17.667
the grey cells. It has to do that.

04:17.918 --> 04:24.042
And because of this pressure of a thinker on that center,

04:24.250 --> 04:28.584
it neglects the other functions, that it has to do:

04:28.792 --> 04:32.959
of looking after your liver, your pancreas,

04:33.125 --> 04:37.250
your spleen and your kidneys

04:37.501 --> 04:41.334
and partly your digestive system.

04:42.125 --> 04:47.584
As a result, all this organs go into problems.

04:48.999 --> 04:53.751
One of them is the pancreas, which causes,

04:53.959 --> 04:55.999
what we call, diabetes.

04:56.501 --> 04:59.375
Liver goes out of order.

04:59.626 --> 05:02.501
When liver goes out of order,

05:02.751 --> 05:05.501
then the heat rises in your body.

05:05.751 --> 05:07.959
From liver it rises higher,

05:08.125 --> 05:11.959
goes upward and catches

05:12.125 --> 05:15.542
on to the right heart center, as we call it,

05:15.751 --> 05:19.667
which gives you a disease called asthma.

05:20.876 --> 05:24.083
Asthma can be easily cured, if you can look after

05:24.292 --> 05:27.083
your over active liver.

05:27.709 --> 05:31.751
It becomes over active, because it has very limited energy,

05:31.959 --> 05:34.000
and it has to do its job,

05:34.209 --> 05:39.042
of expelling poison from your body into the blood stream.

05:39.751 --> 05:44.584
But it has no energy to do that, so it becomes over active.

05:44.792 --> 05:47.417
And such a person, cannot also,

05:47.626 --> 05:49.751
release all the heat of the body

05:49.959 --> 05:53.626
into the bloodstream, so the heat starts passing over.

05:53.999 --> 05:57.501
So much so, that it can reach heart,

05:57.751 --> 06:01.209
and the person can get a massive heart attack.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.709
In the young age, supposing some people,

06:04.999 --> 06:09.999
who are playing tennis and smoking -

06:10.209 --> 06:13.334
I mean all out to destroy them self in a way, I should say -

06:13.626 --> 06:16.000
or some very strenuous games

06:16.209 --> 06:18.751
with that smoking and drinking

06:18.959 --> 06:21.792
and pressurizing themselves, get a very

06:21.999 --> 06:24.999
fatal heart attack, a massive heart attack.

06:25.375 --> 06:31.042
Because they have gone in a complete out of balance situation.

06:31.876 --> 06:37.876
Now, at the same time,

06:38.042 --> 06:40.834
the most dangerous thing

06:40.999 --> 06:44.626
that can happen to us, because of this center,

06:44.834 --> 06:47.042
is that

06:47.250 --> 06:51.709
we get a horrible disease called blood cancer.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.417
Blood cancer comes to us because

06:54.709 --> 06:59.250
of the spleen getting out of order or imbalanced.

06:59.918 --> 07:03.959
The spleen is a speedometer in us, or we can say it`s a,

07:04.125 --> 07:08.709
it`s a rhythm keeper; it keeps our rhythm of life.

07:08.918 --> 07:11.834
But we are all the time out of rhythm.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.667
You sleep at any time, get up at any time

07:15.876 --> 07:20.083
and any kind of emergency that comes in,

07:20.375 --> 07:23.375
this organ has to supply,

07:23.626 --> 07:28.626
red blood corpuscles, RBCs , for the emergency,

07:28.834 --> 07:33.375
any emergency rises. For example you are eating your food;

07:33.584 --> 07:35.918
and then suddenly you have to run,

07:36.083 --> 07:37.584
then what happens,

07:37.792 --> 07:40.999
that you get pain here in the stomach, this side.

07:41.167 --> 07:46.042
Because your spleen has started producing RBCs quickly.

07:46.334 --> 07:48.209
But we are all the time in tensions.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.167
All the time, you are very hectic.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.667
We get up in the morning, first thing we do

07:52.876 --> 07:55.000
horrible thing is to read newspapers.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.584
In the newspaper they never give good news,

07:57.792 --> 08:00.584
always has to be something sensational,

08:00.876 --> 08:04.292
challenging your spleen.

08:04.959 --> 08:08.000
Then the...

08:08.375 --> 08:11.918
Then the spleen, poor thing, starts

08:12.083 --> 08:16.250
excreting or creating more RBCs (red blood cells).

08:16.459 --> 08:22.250
And when that happens, the

08:24.999 --> 08:28.000
person who is doing all these things,

08:28.209 --> 08:33.334
does not realize that already he has tortured this pour spleen.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.459
Again he goes into another hectic life,

08:36.709 --> 08:38.125
for example he may

08:38.334 --> 08:40.876
just jump into his car, he has to go to his office,

08:41.042 --> 08:44.167
then he sees the jam and then he is very upset

08:44.417 --> 08:48.792
because he gets late in the office, then the boss shouts at him,

08:48.999 --> 08:51.792
something like that. All the time there is an emergency,

08:51.999 --> 08:56.375
a time bound life. And all the time people are running up and down

08:56.751 --> 08:59.792
in a very hectic manner.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.167
And this hectic manner makes this pour spleen really crazy.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.959
Doesn’t understand, what's the matter with this gentleman,

09:09.125 --> 09:11.709
why is he behaving like this?

09:12.417 --> 09:15.918
Then the vulnerability is established.

09:16.959 --> 09:20.626
And anything that happens from the left side,

09:20.834 --> 09:23.792
is just triggers the cancer.

09:23.999 --> 09:26.834
I’ll show you how it works out.

09:27.083 --> 09:30.834
This is one center say

09:30.999 --> 09:32.834
from the left side and the right side,

09:32.999 --> 09:36.501
both of them combine to form the real center.

09:36.792 --> 09:40.334
Now, If you are working too hard on the right side, like that,

09:40.501 --> 09:41.959
it starts moving,

09:42.125 --> 09:44.751
taking the energy, exhausting the energy,  it is like this.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.876
And anything happens to the left, it just goes out.

09:49.042 --> 09:50.459
Now, it's broken,

09:50.667 --> 09:54.792
in the sense the relationship with the whole is lost.

09:55.125 --> 09:59.584
So, it gets on its own! It starts working

09:59.792 --> 10:03.250
on its own, we call it a malignant cell.

10:03.459 --> 10:08.209
Means it starts growing, in such a way,

10:08.417 --> 10:13.667
that there is no relationship with other cells.

10:13.959 --> 10:17.876
Or if the nose starts rising, growing,

10:18.042 --> 10:20.250
then this place all gets covered,

10:20.459 --> 10:22.918
this place all gets covered, your ear can get covered,

10:23.083 --> 10:27.459
and the rest of the cells are still growing at the same rate.

10:28.959 --> 10:34.751
This malignancy is because of imbalance in us.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.042
Even ordinary cancer is cause by that.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.999
So, what have we to do?

10:41.167 --> 10:43.834
How are we to overcome these things?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.334
Of course, there are doctors and things.

10:46.584 --> 10:50.125
Most of them are looking after most of the people.

10:50.417 --> 10:56.542
But those who are seeking the truth can be cured by themselves,

10:56.751 --> 10:59.501
because their Kundalini will rise.

10:59.999 --> 11:03.083
When it rises, it nourishes that center,

11:03.292 --> 11:07.999
it brings back the broken like this, nourishes them,

11:08.167 --> 11:12.959
she integrates all the centers, so your thinking,

11:13.125 --> 11:18.999
your heart, your stomach, your liver, all integrated.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.999
You do not repent for anything.

11:22.167 --> 11:24.709
You get an integrated personality,

11:24.918 --> 11:27.667
you get a very
healthy personality.

11:27.876 --> 11:30.542
And such a person

11:30.751 --> 11:35.667
automatically looks very

11:35.918 --> 11:39.000
healthy and very peaceful.

11:39.209 --> 11:41.876
Because the centers that are within us,

11:42.042 --> 11:46.459
which are enlightened, are the centers

11:46.667 --> 11:51.209
which are responsible for different functions in our body.

11:51.709 --> 11:54.999
So the first one I have told you about, the second one,

11:55.209 --> 11:57.918
and the first one I told you about yesterday,

11:58.083 --> 12:00.042
and the next one to that,

12:00.250 --> 12:02.834
is the center which is very important,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.959
is called as a navel center, Nabhi chakra.

12:07.584 --> 12:13.417
This is the one which looks after the solar plexus within us.

12:13.751 --> 12:16.876
So, physically we understand this,

12:17.042 --> 12:22.042
but spiritually this is a very important center.

12:22.250 --> 12:26.250
Because physically of course, you know the problem of the

12:26.459 --> 12:32.792
solar plexuses, but there is another big problem we have,

12:32.999 --> 12:35.083
and that is surrounding it,

12:35.292 --> 12:37.918
is the area,

12:38.083 --> 12:41.417
which we call in Sahaja Yoga as “Void”,

12:41.751 --> 12:43.834
which is to be crossed.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.584
Like,

12:45.792 --> 12:48.417
Moses had to make a bridge , sort of a thing it is.

12:48.626 --> 12:50.709
You have to make a bridge.

12:50.918 --> 12:55.417
And this bridging comes when this part gets enlighten.

12:55.918 --> 13:00.918
Now, this part is made of

13:01.083 --> 13:03.083
ten valences within us.

13:03.292 --> 13:05.999
Human beings have got ten valences.

13:06.292 --> 13:09.792
These ten valences are like Ten Commandments, we can say.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.584
But they are within us, not without.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.918
Once they are enlightened,

13:16.083 --> 13:18.751
than we rise in our own valences,

13:18.959 --> 13:23.125
means we rise in our nature, as a human being.

13:23.334 --> 13:26.334
So, we become very righteous people.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.959
Like all saints are righteous,

13:29.125 --> 13:31.959
they don’t do anything wrong, they don’t cheat,

13:32.125 --> 13:34.083
they don’t tell lies,

13:34.417 --> 13:38.501
they don’t take money, they don’t grab you, they don’t torture you,

13:38.709 --> 13:44.918
they are very loving, dynamic, fearless people.

13:45.125 --> 13:49.125
All these qualities, suddenly,

13:49.792 --> 13:56.918
manifest in a personality, which receives their Self-Realization.

13:57.626 --> 14:02.584
Thus we create a society of wonderful people.

14:05.250 --> 14:08.876
Then we come to another center, which we call

14:09.042 --> 14:12.209
as the center of the Mother

14:12.417 --> 14:17.083
or Mana, but actually is the Heart center.

14:17.501 --> 14:21.792
Heart center in Sahaja Yoga we have three sides,

14:21.999 --> 14:27.000
one is the left, is the heart, right heart and the central heart.

14:27.375 --> 14:32.834
Now, this is the center under the sternum bone,

14:33.000 --> 14:37.125
and all the antibodies are created in the sternum bone,

14:37.334 --> 14:40.042
till you are twelve years of age.

14:40.709 --> 14:43.250
And then they

14:43.459 --> 14:46.876
go to various areas in the body,

14:47.042 --> 14:50.626
and wait for a signal. This is a remote signal,

14:50.834 --> 14:54.667
which comes from the sternum, sternum bone.

14:54.959 --> 14:59.334
Now, those people who suffer from insecurities,

14:59.501 --> 15:03.209
especially women, if they suffer from some insecurities,

15:03.417 --> 15:07.334
from their husbands, or if their motherhood is challenged,

15:07.584 --> 15:12.918
then they develop a very horrible cancer of the breast.

15:13.792 --> 15:16.042
If they are insecure from their husbands,

15:16.250 --> 15:22.417
who are not loyal to them, or some sort of a problem is there,

15:22.626 --> 15:26.417
then the women may develop this breast cancer,

15:26.999 --> 15:31.167
because of this center, being absolutely dislocated,

15:31.459 --> 15:33.667
due to insecurities,

15:33.876 --> 15:37.501
Whenever we see anything facing us which is dangerous,

15:37.751 --> 15:41.792
immediately our sternum bone starts vibrating.

15:41.999 --> 15:45.792
Those vibrations are remotely caught by the antibodies,

15:45.999 --> 15:49.334
and they get ready to fight the diseases.

15:49.584 --> 15:53.334
But when the connection is lost

15:53.709 --> 15:56.417
and the cells become malignant,

15:56.709 --> 16:00.292
antibodies also get tired fighting it.

16:00.876 --> 16:03.501
So when the Kundalini is passing through this,

16:03.918 --> 16:06.834
this center gets again nourished,

16:06.999 --> 16:13.584
and one can achieve a great sense of security within himself,

16:13.792 --> 16:19.209
very great sense of security. He feels absolutely secure.

16:20.334 --> 16:26.709
Then the same Kundalini rises, up to the center we call as Vishudhi.

16:27.250 --> 16:32.501
This center is the one, which

16:32.709 --> 16:36.792
looks after sixteen things.

16:37.083 --> 16:41.417
You can say ear, nose, tongue, teeth, everything.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.626
They are sixteen things it looks; it has got sixteen petals.

16:45.918 --> 16:50.334
Face, eyes, everything it looks after.

16:50.584 --> 16:53.751
But it can also go out of order,

16:54.042 --> 16:56.751
when we go into imbalances about it.

16:57.167 --> 17:00.167
As a result, a person loses many things.

17:00.417 --> 17:04.417
But when, you are nourished by it

17:04.626 --> 17:07.501
by the Kundalini, then what happens?

17:07.751 --> 17:10.626
That you just become a witness.

17:10.876 --> 17:17.000
You, somehow or other, get out of the crazy world

17:17.209 --> 17:20.751
and you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.250
Like, you are seeing some drama, supposing,

17:23.459 --> 17:25.209
and then you see Napoleon.

17:25.417 --> 17:27.250
Then you think you are also Napoleon,

17:27.459 --> 17:29.834
and you start really going with him.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.999
But when the drama is over, then suddenly you realize,

17:33.167 --> 17:35.375
“Oh, I am not Napoleon, I am something else!”

17:35.584 --> 17:39.501
In the same way, when we are involved in this mad world,

17:39.709 --> 17:42.000
then we are upset.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.417
Say, we are standing in the water,

17:44.667 --> 17:47.042
we are afraid of getting drowned.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.751
The water rises, falls down again,

17:50.959 --> 17:53.876
there is another wave comes and goes down.

17:54.042 --> 17:59.792
But supposing, somehow, you get onto a boat,

17:59.999 --> 18:02.542
then you can watch that water,

18:02.751 --> 18:04.999
and if you become an expert swimmer,

18:05.209 --> 18:07.626
you can jump in and save others also.

18:07.834 --> 18:12.417
The same thing happens, that you just start

18:13.083 --> 18:15.584
seeing the whole thing like a drama.

18:15.792 --> 18:18.375
Your problem you see as a drama.

18:18.626 --> 18:21.209
Now, because you are not in that problem,

18:21.417 --> 18:24.083
you can solve your problem, very easily.

18:24.292 --> 18:26.834
It’s very simple to solve that problem,

18:26.999 --> 18:30.292
because you are not in it. If you are involve in it you are going

18:30.501 --> 18:31.834
into a turmoil.

18:31.999 --> 18:35.167
But if you are out of it, you know what is the solution

18:35.375 --> 18:38.709
and it can be solved very easily.

18:39.250 --> 18:42.125
Now, the center that we call as the Agya chakra,

18:42.334 --> 18:47.334
which is placed between the optic chiasma, is very important.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.626
On one side, it looks after the pituitary

18:50.834 --> 18:54.083
and the other side it looks after the pineal body.

18:54.292 --> 18:59.250
Now the pituitary is responsible for controlling this Mr. Ego,

18:59.584 --> 19:02.667
and on the other side we have got superego

19:02.959 --> 19:05.209
which is created by our conditionings.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.792
We have so many conditionings.

19:07.999 --> 19:10.292
We have conditionings of the country where we are born in,

19:10.501 --> 19:13.375
we have conditionings in the family we are born in,

19:13.667 --> 19:15.834
our parents and then we have

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
conditionings with the religion we are born in,

19:18.209 --> 19:20.667
and all kind of conditionings we have.

19:20.876 --> 19:24.709
All these conditionings make the another balloon,

19:24.918 --> 19:29.876
and both of them form a crest on our head

19:30.042 --> 19:31.918
that’s how our fontanel bone area,

19:32.083 --> 19:35.209
which was a soft bone become a hard bone.

19:35.959 --> 19:39.042
But when the Kundalini rises

19:39.250 --> 19:43.417
and passes through this center, it sucks in.

19:44.209 --> 19:48.083
That's how our karmas, so called, whatever action or

19:48.501 --> 19:51.667
wrong things we have done or the wrong conditionings we have,

19:51.876 --> 19:54.250
everything gets sucked in

19:54.501 --> 19:57.209
and it opens like a petal.

19:57.501 --> 20:01.209
The limbic area, that is between, opens

20:01.417 --> 20:03.334
and the Kundalini passes through,

20:03.626 --> 20:05.959
pierces through your fontanel bone area

20:06.125 --> 20:10.042
and you start feeling the cool breeze out of your head.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.250
You are surprised how it happened.

20:12.459 --> 20:16.417
And then you can feel it all around you is cool breeze .

20:16.709 --> 20:19.209
which is the All Pervading Power.

20:19.417 --> 20:23.375
As a result that you become one with this,

20:23.626 --> 20:26.626
all the time the energy is flowing through you

20:26.834 --> 20:29.417
and though you may going into imbalances a little bit,

20:29.667 --> 20:32.375
but you come to balance in no time.

20:32.876 --> 20:35.334
This is as far as the physical side is concerned.

20:35.584 --> 20:38.167
Mentally you feel perfectly all right,

20:38.375 --> 20:43.709
but above all, you develop a new dimension in your awareness,

20:43.918 --> 20:47.959
which we call as “collective consciousness”.

20:49.083 --> 20:53.959
Collective consciousness about which, Jung has said lots of things.

20:54.417 --> 20:57.918
Collective consciousness is where you can feel the centers of others

20:58.083 --> 20:59.999
on your fingertips

21:00.167 --> 21:05.167
and also you can feel your own centers.

21:05.375 --> 21:09.292
And if you know to correct yours and then of others,

21:09.501 --> 21:13.209
you can easily manage the whole thing.

21:13.667 --> 21:17.751
So this collective consciousness is the one, is the new awareness,

21:17.959 --> 21:20.918
a new dimension, which one has to achieve.

21:21.083 --> 21:24.167
This is the new birth,

21:24.375 --> 21:27.626
or we should say, the second birth, as we call it.

21:27.834 --> 21:30.709
In Sanskrit language

21:30.918 --> 21:35.834
is called as, a person who is

21:37.083 --> 21:41.667
a realized soul, is called a “dwijaha”, means born twice.

21:41.999 --> 21:45.417
And a bird is also called dwijaha, because first is an egg

21:45.709 --> 21:49.667
and then it is born as a bird, a free bird.

21:49.959 --> 21:54.959
In the same way, a person who is a realized soul has a second birth.

21:55.125 --> 21:58.083
As they say, ”You are to be born again”, it happens.

21:58.292 --> 22:01.417
But it is actualization, it is not just a certificate.

22:01.792 --> 22:04.709
Anybody can take a certificate, ”I am this, I am that”,

22:04.918 --> 22:06.417
that makes no difference.

22:06.667 --> 22:10.209
Because you must have the powers, of what you are.

22:10.417 --> 22:13.918
If you are a human being, you have, you have human powers.

22:14.083 --> 22:18.334
In the same way, if you become a realized soul, super human being,

22:18.584 --> 22:22.459
than you must have the powers of a super human being.

22:22.834 --> 22:25.292
If you don’t have these powers, it is no use

22:25.501 --> 22:28.042
giving a false certificate like that.

22:28.250 --> 22:31.292
Same as I told you about religion,
when somebody asked Me the question,

22:31.626 --> 22:34.000
that why are they fight
in the name of religion?

22:34.209 --> 22:36.792
Because it's man-made.

22:37.667 --> 22:41.584
Saints never fight. They never fight.

22:41.959 --> 22:45.999
They love and they understand each other and they know the Absolute.

22:47.459 --> 22:52.209
So, when your Spirit, which is in your heart,

22:52.584 --> 22:55.334
has the seat here

22:55.501 --> 22:59.751
and it gets connected with your attention,

22:59.999 --> 23:03.918
then the light of the Spirit makes you an enlightened person,

23:04.167 --> 23:08.999
and in that light, you know what is right and what is wrong.

23:09.250 --> 23:13.876
What is good for you, what is constructive and what is destructive.

23:14.834 --> 23:17.584
The power of Spirit is,

23:17.792 --> 23:21.250
that of course it's a collective being within us, no doubt,

23:21.626 --> 23:24.417
also we say that we are part and a parcel of the whole.

23:24.709 --> 23:26.167
But we are not.

23:26.375 --> 23:28.834
Once you become collectively conscious,

23:28.999 --> 23:31.918
then you are only part and parcel of the whole.

23:32.250 --> 23:36.042
Then you become

23:36.250 --> 23:38.542
the source of joy.

23:38.751 --> 23:43.000
Spirit is the source of joy. You become joyous,

23:43.209 --> 23:44.834
you are full of joy.

23:44.999 --> 23:48.542
Joy s not double-faced,

23:48.751 --> 23:50.751
it's not like happiness - unhappiness.

23:50.959 --> 23:55.501
It's a permanent state of enjoyment.

23:56.167 --> 23:58.999
And, you know the absolute truth.

23:59.375 --> 24:03.209
On your fingertips you can know. Even in the Koran, as I told you,

24:03.417 --> 24:07.209
in the Koran it is said that, “Your hands will speak

24:07.417 --> 24:09.459
at the time of your Resurrection,

24:09.709 --> 24:12.000
and they will give witness against you”.

24:12.209 --> 24:16.000
So, this is the time of your Judgment, Last Judgment,

24:16.209 --> 24:20.083
when your Kundalini is going to tell you, where you stand.

24:20.417 --> 24:24.918
And once you correct yourself, you enter into the Kingdom of God.

24:25.083 --> 24:31.542
This has to happen. It's nothing artificial about it, is all

24:31.751 --> 24:33.918
living process

24:34.083 --> 24:38.375
of a living energy, which works

24:38.584 --> 24:42.667
and you cannot pay for it. You cannot pay for it.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.834
This is the only snag, if there is anything.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.584
So may God bless you all.

24:49.876 --> 24:53.250
Yesterday we spent lot of time asking questions and answering,

24:53.459 --> 24:56.542
I don’t mind a little bit of that, but not too much...

24:56.751 --> 24:59.459
Yesterday we had too many questions and answers.

24:59.709 --> 25:04.125
So, if you could ask Me some questions, is all right.

25:04.501 --> 25:07.792
But should be relevant. Because you know, I’m not here

25:07.999 --> 25:11.459
to get anything out of you, is just to tell you what you have,

25:11.709 --> 25:14.083
to give you what is yours.

25:14.584 --> 25:18.167
It all happens because of your energy.

25:18.751 --> 25:22.000
I have nothing to do with it in a way.

25:22.209 --> 25:27.417
Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another light.

25:33.501 --> 25:35.918
Q: Could you tell something about the nadis?

25:36.083 --> 25:39.709
SM: Nadis... You didn’t tell them?

25:42.999 --> 25:46.751
He told Me he has already talked to you!

25:48.751 --> 25:53.125
The left one is known as the Ida Nadi,

25:53.334 --> 25:55.667
which get us to the left side.

25:55.876 --> 25:59.999
The right one as the Pingala Nadi, which gets us to the right side.

26:00.417 --> 26:03.999
The central one is known as the Sushumna Nadi.

26:04.334 --> 26:07.042
Also, there are a many other details about it,

26:07.250 --> 26:10.999
which once you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will know a lot of.

26:11.999 --> 26:15.417
It's too much really, because I must have given at least

26:15.709 --> 26:17.792
three thousand to four thousands lectures,

26:17.999 --> 26:19.501
in English language itself,

26:19.751 --> 26:22.959
and they are all on the tape, you can always listen to them.

26:23.125 --> 26:26.584
Knowledge is like a vast ocean,

26:26.918 --> 26:30.626
and the source of knowledge is your Spirit.

26:30.918 --> 26:32.501
So, once you are realized,

26:32.751 --> 26:35.709
you will be able to understand everything.

26:51.417 --> 26:54.918
Q: What happens when a huge amount of energy comes out of here

26:55.083 --> 26:58.417
and manifests himself in forms of pictures?

26:58.626 --> 27:00.667
Is, is a,

27:00.876 --> 27:03.876
that means this center is broken.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.918
Is not all right.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.626
You shouldn’t see anything.

27:08.834 --> 27:11.792
You shouldn’t see the light. You have to be the light.

27:11.999 --> 27:15.584
If I see the light, then I’m not the light!

27:16.459 --> 27:18.375
All right?

27:28.501 --> 27:32.709
Q:How much influence does food have on the collective consciousness?

27:32.918 --> 27:34.792
SM: - What has... ?
P: - Food.

27:34.999 --> 27:41.834
Food... You see, is food, food we deal with in such a manner,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.542
that whatever is deficient in a person,

27:45.751 --> 27:49.709
whatever is complementary in a person, should be eaten.

27:51.292 --> 27:54.709
Like, you have to,

27:54.999 --> 27:58.751
supposing, you people are very right sided

27:58.959 --> 28:01.459
then you must take to carbohydrates;

28:01.834 --> 28:05.999
but if you are left sided, then you have to take to proteins.

28:07.250 --> 28:12.292
But very big animals than human beings are not to be eaten,

28:12.667 --> 28:15.250
because their muscles are very big,

28:15.459 --> 28:18.667
and they cause troubles to your teeth and things like that.

28:18.876 --> 28:22.417
But food becomes the secondary thing,

28:22.667 --> 28:26.876
after you have had the ambrosia of Realization.

28:27.042 --> 28:28.667
It is no so important.

28:28.876 --> 28:32.584
Just don’t bother too much about food, at all.

28:44.459 --> 28:46.876
SM: What  is he saying?

29:16.501 --> 29:19.999
Q: How the people balance?

29:20.167 --> 29:24.000
Individually, everybody has a different set of problems.

29:24.209 --> 29:26.667
How does each individual balance ?

29:26.959 --> 29:29.417
Bring them back to the balance.

29:29.709 --> 29:33.459
SM: I mean, first is, of course, individual balance,

29:35.667 --> 29:38.209
and when you are individually balanced,

29:38.417 --> 29:41.792
then when you are the Spirit,

29:41.999 --> 29:44.083
then it's a collective consciousness.

29:44.292 --> 29:47.501
In that the Spirit gives you

29:47.709 --> 29:50.751
an absolute nature.

29:50.959 --> 29:52.999
And everybody being absolute

29:53.167 --> 29:55.999
there is no problem of balancing with anyone else.

29:56.167 --> 29:58.501
You just enjoy each other. That's all.

29:58.751 --> 30:01.000
Only you are dressed up differently,

30:01.209 --> 30:04.999
you comb your hair differently. That doesn’t matter.

30:05.209 --> 30:10.000
That’s all outside. But inside you enjoy each other.

30:10.250 --> 30:13.417
There is a beautiful

30:13.626 --> 30:16.876
thing said about one poet

30:17.042 --> 30:20.250
Namadeva - yesterday i told them about that one, no? -

30:20.459 --> 30:25.792
about Namadeva, who was a tailor, just a tailor.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.334
And he went to see another realized soul,

30:29.501 --> 30:33.000
another saint, in another village,

30:33.209 --> 30:35.292
who was a potter.

30:35.584 --> 30:40.334
And the potter was needing the clay with his feet

30:40.501 --> 30:43.334
when this Namadeva went there.

30:43.626 --> 30:46.584
And he went and he stood, stand.

30:46.999 --> 30:51.042
And he said, a beautiful poem he has written,

30:51.334 --> 30:54.876
that, „I came here to see

30:55.375 --> 30:58.250
the formless", means the vibrations.

30:58.501 --> 31:00.792
"I came here to feel the vibrations,

31:00.999 --> 31:03.792
I came here to see the formless,

31:03.999 --> 31:06.751
but the whole formless is in your form!”

31:06.999 --> 31:09.626
What an appreciation, what an enjoyment

31:09.834 --> 31:12.709
and what endearment it creates.

31:12.918 --> 31:15.876
I mean, we human beings never talk like that, you see.

31:16.042 --> 31:21.751
When we talk to each other is so artificial and can be very

31:21.959 --> 31:25.209
selfish , can be very skimming and
can be anything. You just don’t know.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.834
If somebody says, ”Thank you” to you, you often start thinking

31:28.000 --> 31:30.834
”Why, what did I do?”

31:32.834 --> 31:34.959
Or somebody says something bad about you,

31:35.125 --> 31:36.918
”You should know I've done nothing good for him,

31:37.083 --> 31:39.334
why is it saying bad about me, I don't know”,

31:39.501 --> 31:41.250
is like that, you see, is not that.

31:41.459 --> 31:44.292
It’s absolutely clear cut.

31:44.667 --> 31:47.959
Cristal clear temperament you get, absolutely.

31:48.918 --> 31:52.209
You become crystal clear and the other person is also crystal clear

31:52.417 --> 31:54.501
and they are just enjoy each other. That`s all.

31:54.709 --> 31:56.083
We have never enjoy each other.

31:56.292 --> 31:58.792
Actually we have never used the Power of Love,

31:58.999 --> 32:00.751
we have always use the power of hatred.

32:00.959 --> 32:02.375
Anything that you want to do,

32:02.584 --> 32:06.167
you have to put some sort of an issue to fight.

32:06.375 --> 32:09.042
Here there is no such question.

32:11.167 --> 32:13.042
Such a state we all should have,

32:13.250 --> 32:15.459
for the emancipation of humanity,

32:15.751 --> 32:18.626
for the emancipation of our country,

32:18.834 --> 32:21.042
all the countries, all over the world,

32:21.250 --> 32:24.292
for our children and for ourselves.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.834
- Yes Sir ?

32:36.876 --> 32:41.000
Q: What happens to Kundalini, whether a major accident,

32:41.250 --> 32:43.999
or some injury to this area?

32:44.209 --> 32:47.584
SM: We have to correct it. If it's physically very much injured,

32:47.792 --> 32:51.125
it can be corrected. There is no such problem.

32:52.876 --> 32:55.042
Yes, please.

33:13.375 --> 33:18.000
Q: Everything in creation isn't it connected,

33:18.209 --> 33:22.667
therefore couldn't there be

33:24.918 --> 33:29.250
could it be possible that free choice is actually Maya?

33:37.999 --> 33:42.667
SM: You have free choice to know it’s Maya.

33:48.042 --> 33:50.709
You have to reach that point.

33:50.999 --> 33:54.000
Otherwise you will never accept. You see, you are a human beings.

33:54.209 --> 33:56.209
If you are told anything you'll never accept it.

33:56.417 --> 34:00.083
So it's better to reach that point, where to feel that is all

34:00.292 --> 34:02.626
sort of illusion.

34:02.876 --> 34:05.375
And then you discover it.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.584
You have to have that much free choice.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.876
You are made that way.

34:13.125 --> 34:18.042
And such a choice is to be accepted, to be respected.

34:32.834 --> 34:35.334
Q: Kundalini is such a strong force.

34:35.501 --> 34:41.250
Now, what happens when it doesn’t actually achieve a connection?

34:43.667 --> 34:46.834
SM:In Sahaja Yoga we'll see that it reaches that  point.

34:46.999 --> 34:50.417
But it is a force like.

34:51.959 --> 34:54.876
In a seed there is a primule.

34:55.167 --> 34:59.083
And the primule first just sprouts

34:59.667 --> 35:03.334
then a little plant it becomes,

35:03.501 --> 35:06.209
gradually it becomes a very big tree.

35:06.417 --> 35:09.626
And out of that tree, thousands of seeds coming.

35:09.834 --> 35:13.918
So, in that little bit of that seed,

35:14.083 --> 35:18.959
there are the maps of all these creations.

35:19.375 --> 35:22.375
In the same way, that Kundalini is a force.

35:22.667 --> 35:27.876
Supposing it rises and it reaches the apex also

35:28.042 --> 35:29.584
and is not established,

35:29.792 --> 35:32.250
then we have to remember the parabola of Christ,

35:32.459 --> 35:37.000
that, ”Some of the seeds fell in the marshy land and got lost”.

35:37.584 --> 35:41.083
Then again they take birth, then again they work it out.

35:41.334 --> 35:44.501
So, best is getting done, once for all.

35:44.959 --> 35:49.292
The time has come, is the blossom time, better have it done.

35:52.042 --> 35:53.918
Q: Perhaps now would be the time.

35:54.209 --> 35:58.083
SM: Of course. Perhaps now it is, it is the time.

36:00.125 --> 36:02.375
Yes, please.

36:21.626 --> 36:25.334
Q: Can any yoga balance the mind?

36:25.584 --> 36:27.709
SM: Cannot.

36:28.250 --> 36:32.334
Any other yoga is a part and parcel of the same.

36:32.501 --> 36:35.334
Actually, they have separated.

36:36.792 --> 36:40.999
They have taken out one part of yoga, one part of yoga there.

36:41.167 --> 36:44.709
It's a, if you see the Patanjali Yoga it is Ashtangas,

36:44.918 --> 36:47.125
means there are eight full.

36:47.834 --> 36:51.584
And basically is dealt with the ascent,

36:51.792 --> 36:55.999
with the thoughtless awareness, which are Nirvichar Samadhi,

36:56.209 --> 37:00.083
and then with the doubtless awareness, which has to be achieved,

37:00.292 --> 37:03.751
and that is only through the Kundalini awakening.

37:03.959 --> 37:07.999
Also, he has suggested some exercises that have to be done,

37:08.167 --> 37:09.834
if it is necessary.

37:09.999 --> 37:12.334
When the Kundalini rises, we know what the problem is,

37:12.501 --> 37:14.792
and we can do the exercises.

37:15.334 --> 37:19.417
And so, all the yogas are included in Sahaja Yoga.

37:19.751 --> 37:23.042
When the Kundalini rises, then it goes into Raja Yoga,

37:23.250 --> 37:26.834
in the sense that one center augments,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.834
when the Kundalini is passed through that.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Supposing the Kundalini has come out of it,

37:31.209 --> 37:33.167
then it has to close,

37:33.417 --> 37:35.042
because it has to stop the Kundalini.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.459
Then it passes through another, then it has to close again.

37:38.709 --> 37:40.334
All these is called bhandan.

37:40.584 --> 37:42.667
But this is not to be done outside.

37:42.876 --> 37:45.083
It is to be done by the machinery itself

37:45.292 --> 37:47.751
which works spontaneously, automatically.

37:47.959 --> 37:49.999
Yesterday I told you, as the car starts,

37:50.167 --> 37:51.834
all the machine starts working.

37:51.999 --> 37:54.918
But without starting the car, if you start moving the wheels,

37:55.083 --> 37:58.000
what will happen?

38:09.959 --> 38:12.876
Q: How this period that we are living in now,

38:13.042 --> 38:15.667
be viewed from the future?

38:16.083 --> 38:19.999
SM: Viewd from the future? Is the excellent time, the best time.

38:20.167 --> 38:23.918
And then we are not thinking of future or of past.

38:24.083 --> 38:27.250
Once we enter into that, then we just enjoy the present,

38:27.459 --> 38:30.959
which we have never enjoyed. Because future doesn’t exist.

38:31.125 --> 38:34.083
The past is over. We have to be in present.

38:34.292 --> 38:36.167
So we establish ourselves in present

38:36.375 --> 38:38.751
and enjoy every moment of it.

38:41.626 --> 38:45.709
Future is just our imagination, idea.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.292
Q: Can one person release the energy for another?

38:58.501 --> 39:01.626
SM: Of course. That’s what I said.

39:01.876 --> 39:05.000
One enlighten person can enlighten another person.

39:07.876 --> 39:10.584
Q: Through the method of Shiatsu?

39:10.792 --> 39:12.709
Shiatsu.

39:14.417 --> 39:17.292
SM: No, there is not such a thing. Only under your hand.

39:17.501 --> 39:19.834
You can move it. It moves through your hand.

39:19.999 --> 39:23.292
Just if you move like this, you can do it.

39:23.501 --> 39:24.959
As simple as that.

39:25.125 --> 39:29.292
It has to be simple. Because it is so vital.

39:41.042 --> 39:44.000
Q: Krishnamurti doesn't believe this,

39:44.209 --> 39:48.459
he believes that the health can come to you...

39:50.918 --> 39:52.999
It has to come to you.

39:54.250 --> 39:58.334
SM: You see, Krishnamurti has said too many things.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.792
Talking is not the way,

40:08.999 --> 40:12.501
it is the actualization, is the becoming.  That is important.

40:12.751 --> 40:15.209
So many books have been written. I tell you.

40:15.417 --> 40:18.959
Even you see the books, one goes mad the way this is written

40:19.125 --> 40:22.000
and really people are wondering, "What is what? What is what?"

40:22.209 --> 40:24.042
Who want to go? What to do?

40:24.250 --> 40:26.999
Actually, it's the actualization.

40:27.209 --> 40:30.459
It's the actualization that is important.

40:32.626 --> 40:35.250
Q: Should I ask You, now is the time for that actualization?

40:35.459 --> 40:37.292
SM: Yes, of course.

40:37.626 --> 40:42.042
It's all right. There's one lady there. Yes, madam.

41:13.751 --> 41:16.209
What is she reading?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.167
What is it?

41:57.250 --> 41:59.000
I can get few words.

41:59.209 --> 42:01.334
Q:I think I got the message now.

42:01.667 --> 42:05.876
Mother the lady is asking a question as to,

42:06.042 --> 42:09.584
she is wondering whether the awakening of Kundalini

42:09.792 --> 42:12.292
can in fact be dangerous? She's red a number of books where...

42:12.501 --> 42:15.918
SM: Yes, yes, is correct. That I should have covered already.

42:16.083 --> 42:18.918
It is not dangerous at all. At all.

42:19.250 --> 42:20.834
You see this books are written by people

42:21.000 --> 42:22.626
who are absolutely unauthorized.

42:22.876 --> 42:25.125
Have they raised anybody's Kundalini? They have not.

42:25.375 --> 42:28.459
But, just, just a moment, sit down, sit down.

42:28.709 --> 42:30.584
You see, this job is to be done by

42:30.792 --> 42:33.417
somebody who is authorized by the Divine.

42:33.667 --> 42:36.501
Every Tom, Dick and Harry can not do it.

42:36.792 --> 42:39.626
You see, when you put, supposing aplug into the,

42:39.834 --> 42:41.501
you put your hand into the plug

42:41.709 --> 42:43.709
and say that electricity is dangerous,

42:43.918 --> 42:45.667
because you don’t know what plug is.

42:45.876 --> 42:48.751
You have to know it. If you know it, you can do it.

42:48.959 --> 42:51.876
Is not, this is all modern, is all modern I think,

42:52.042 --> 42:54.584
is more 20th century knowledge that has come up.

42:54.834 --> 42:57.667
None of the old books have written such a nonsense like that.

42:57.876 --> 42:59.083
This is just to frighten people

42:59.292 --> 43:02.250
so that they don’t gate their Realization, is the point!

43:02.459 --> 43:04.250
She is your Mother.

43:04.501 --> 43:08.209
Kundalini is your Mother, your individual Mother

43:08.417 --> 43:11.292
and She knows each and every thing about you.

43:11.501 --> 43:14.834
Not only that, but She is such a loving Mother,

43:14.999 --> 43:17.000
that She gives your rebirth,

43:17.209 --> 43:21.417
without even you knowing about it, till you realy feel it.

43:21.709 --> 43:23.834
It’s so wonderful!

43:24.000 --> 43:27.209
Now, your mother, when she gave your birth,

43:27.417 --> 43:29.751
she took up all the labor pains upon herself.

43:29.959 --> 43:32.626
In the same way, now we have thousands of people

43:32.834 --> 43:34.751
who got Realization.

43:35.083 --> 43:38.250
Nobody felt anything bad except sometimes you do feel little heat,

43:38.459 --> 43:40.417
that's all. Thousands of people.

43:40.667 --> 43:43.292
But the people who have written that, is all modern style.

43:43.501 --> 43:46.626
On the contrary, there was

43:46.876 --> 43:48.918
a great saint called Ramadasa,

43:49.083 --> 43:52.209
at the time os Shivaji. He was the guru of Shivaji.

43:52.417 --> 43:54.918
Was a very well known king of Maharashtra.

43:55.083 --> 43:57.375
And somebody asked him that,

43:57.626 --> 44:00.000
“How much time takes does it take for a Kundalini to rise?”

44:00.209 --> 44:03.709
So he used a Sanskrit word means tatkshana, means that moment.

44:03.918 --> 44:07.834
But the person who has to do it has to be authorized,

44:07.999 --> 44:11.876
and the person who has to take it, must desire it!

44:12.250 --> 44:13.459
That is the word used.

44:13.667 --> 44:16.083
This is all modern nonsense that has come up to sell books.

44:16.292 --> 44:20.125
That's all I think. Or some of the people, who have no authority,

44:20.334 --> 44:22.375
those who led a very funny life.

44:22.626 --> 44:25.792
I know of someone who has written a funny book about Kundalini,

44:25.999 --> 44:28.834
who has a very bad life of his own,

44:28.999 --> 44:33.918
and he says that, "I got such a shock, I got this, that". Naturally.

44:34.584 --> 44:37.334
You had no business to enter into an area,

44:37.584 --> 44:39.751
where you are not authorized.

44:39.959 --> 44:43.999
And if so, also you should have gone to somebody who is authorized.

44:44.209 --> 44:48.209
The authority has to come from the Divine, that’s important.

44:54.918 --> 44:57.083
Q: Who is your guru he is asking?

44:57.292 --> 45:01.125
I am my own guru and I’ll make you your own guru.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.167
You don't have to go to any guru, anymore.

45:07.417 --> 45:12.167
You become your own guru. When the Atma, the Spirit comes into you,

45:12.375 --> 45:14.999
then you don’t need any guru. Why do you need?

45:15.709 --> 45:17.792
Of course I can give you guidance

45:17.999 --> 45:21.918
and at the most, you can call Me, The Mother. That’s all.

45:23.959 --> 45:26.667
There is no need to be subservient to anyone.

45:26.876 --> 45:30.209
There is no need to pay anyone. Of course, not, you cannot pay.

45:30.417 --> 45:33.000
Anybody who takes your money is your servant,

45:33.209 --> 45:35.209
a man has no self respect.

45:35.417 --> 45:39.042
He takes money from you for God, how can he?

45:41.584 --> 45:45.000
And we also, very foolishly, give money to such horrible people,

45:45.209 --> 45:47.792
who are just devils!

45:48.501 --> 45:51.584
They are evil geniuses.

45:51.792 --> 45:54.167
And the way they have managed this,

45:54.417 --> 45:57.959
is they have realy made so many people so very sick,

45:58.125 --> 46:00.999
that sometimes, I do not know,

46:01.209 --> 46:04.709
where are they going to land up, the way they have been.

46:05.626 --> 46:07.792
How madam?

46:10.125 --> 46:13.751
Q: Can You give us some person, can You give us somebody

46:13.959 --> 46:15.792
individually, when You say this?

46:15.999 --> 46:18.125
SM:Most of them are in the market.

46:19.167 --> 46:20.918
They are in the market.

46:21.083 --> 46:23.501
I need not take their names, at this auspicious time.

46:23.751 --> 46:26.000
Horrible people.

46:28.626 --> 46:31.042
Yes, madam?

46:38.042 --> 46:42.292
Q: Is being over-emotional concerned with thinking?

46:43.918 --> 46:45.501
SM: More emotional...

46:45.709 --> 46:47.999
Q: Is over-emotional, she is saying.

46:48.167 --> 46:51.083
SM: Yes, you see, both ways one thinks.

46:51.292 --> 46:53.417
Over-emotional people also think

46:53.626 --> 46:56.667
and those who are not emotional also think.

46:56.876 --> 46:59.667
This is no question, it acts on both the sides.

46:59.876 --> 47:02.667
The emotional people think of the past, "Oh, I was so happy,

47:02.876 --> 47:06.167
now I am so unhappy", sort of a thing, you see?

47:06.375 --> 47:11.709
And the people who are not emotional

47:11.918 --> 47:15.042
think how to make others unhappy?

47:36.999 --> 47:39.709
Q: How does what You are talking about line up

47:39.918 --> 47:43.292
with what is written in the Bible, about salvation?

47:43.626 --> 47:45.667
SM: About what?
Q: Salvation.

47:45.876 --> 47:48.709
SM: Same thing it is Madam, is the same thing.

47:49.083 --> 47:52.250
Absolutely, Bible can be only explained through Sahaja Yoga.

47:52.584 --> 47:55.083
Gita can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga.

47:55.292 --> 47:57.250
Koran can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga.

47:57.459 --> 47:59.792
You have to read between the lines.

48:00.042 --> 48:02.334
Christ was given only three, four years.

48:02.584 --> 48:05.626
What is three, four years to explain anything?

48:05.999 --> 48:08.417
People were so cruel.

48:08.709 --> 48:10.250
You know, I was in London,

48:10.459 --> 48:12.792
four years I was struggling with seven hippies.

48:12.999 --> 48:15.334
Couldn't give them Realization, it's so horrible.

48:15.584 --> 48:18.125
What could He do in four years?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.792
It’s not an easy thing to work it out.

48:40.834 --> 48:44.542
Q: Is Kundalini the only force in this particular time,

48:44.751 --> 48:46.334
that will do this particular job?

48:46.501 --> 48:50.459
SM: No, all the time this was the force, all the time.

48:50.667 --> 48:52.626
It's all the time, this was the force.

48:52.834 --> 48:55.918
It’s called also, in the Bible it is said,

48:56.083 --> 48:59.501
that about the tree of life, is this mechanism.

48:59.751 --> 49:03.876
Also said that "I'll appear before you as tongues of flames"

49:04.042 --> 49:06.417
is the, the, when the Kundalini rises,

49:06.626 --> 49:08.334
then your centers look like that.

49:08.501 --> 49:10.751
So many things there are even in the Bible.

49:10.959 --> 49:13.459
In everything, in Koran it is called as Asas,

49:13.709 --> 49:16.959
the names are different, but it is so.

49:17.501 --> 49:22.626
Like Tao is the Kundalini. Tao as described, is also Kundalini.

49:22.834 --> 49:25.083
Zen system, Zen also means the same.

49:25.292 --> 49:27.125
Dhyana is the same thing.

49:27.334 --> 49:28.959
Confucious talked of the same thing,

49:29.125 --> 49:30.999
Socrates talked of the same thing.

49:31.167 --> 49:33.834
But only thing, is not said so clearly,

49:33.999 --> 49:37.000
because there were not people intelligent as you are today,

49:37.209 --> 49:40.709
to understand it, I think, that it was not said so clearly.

49:40.918 --> 49:45.083
Today we have so many seekers, can you imagine? So many seekers.

49:45.292 --> 49:46.834
The world is full of them.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.501
And they are intelligent, they have understood

49:50.709 --> 49:53.584
what is Divine, they try to understand.

49:53.792 --> 49:56.459
Is a very different category of people.

49:56.667 --> 50:00.334
As William Blake has said: “These are men of God”.

50:00.501 --> 50:04.209
They will find God and they will make others men of God.”

50:04.417 --> 50:06.626
It's very clearly he has said it hundred years back.

50:06.834 --> 50:08.083
So, that is what it is.

50:08.292 --> 50:11.042
And it is all, also in one of the Nadi Granthas,

50:11.250 --> 50:15.792
which was written by Brighu Muni, who was the originator of

50:15.999 --> 50:19.667
the horoscopes and all that, astrology.

50:19.876 --> 50:22.417
He has written very clearly that this is going to happen

50:22.667 --> 50:24.876
and this year specially is something

50:25.042 --> 50:29.876
according to the calculations, seems to be a big explosion.

50:34.167 --> 50:37.292
It's just like that.

51:00.667 --> 51:04.501
Q: Even in somebody who is severely injured like in the spinal cord,

51:04.709 --> 51:06.459
can Kundalini be raised?

51:06.667 --> 51:09.999
SM: Yes can be. Can be, most of the people do get it.

51:10.167 --> 51:13.334
If somebody has to much of problems then

51:13.501 --> 51:16.459
than it maybe that, it may little bit trouble,

51:16.667 --> 51:18.042
but one can correct it.

51:18.250 --> 51:22.250
It's, you see, the generosity of Divine is such,

51:22.459 --> 51:25.250
that He tries to give it to everyone.

51:25.459 --> 51:28.667
So much, that I'm Myself amazed.

51:28.918 --> 51:30.792
It doesn't consider anything else.

51:30.999 --> 51:33.999
Just like a big

51:36.209 --> 51:39.167
whirlwind it comes, just.

51:39.375 --> 51:43.292
I am Myself surprised how people get Realization.

51:44.417 --> 51:46.999
Where, like people,

51:47.167 --> 51:50.667
in Russia I was telling you yesterday. Then I went to Bogota.

51:50.876 --> 51:52.042
They have never heard about Me,

51:52.250 --> 51:54.334
nothing of the kind, and thousands were there.

51:54.501 --> 51:57.209
They all got Realization. Very surprising.

51:57.417 --> 51:59.417
I was so surprised.

52:00.209 --> 52:02.417
It's something is there

52:02.667 --> 52:07.125
in the generosity of the Divine that it's working out.

52:07.417 --> 52:13.709
And is better that we all get drenched into that.

52:19.999 --> 52:25.083
All right. So we'll have the process of Realization.

52:25.918 --> 52:30.125
Just to remove your doubts, I talked to you and allowed you to

52:30.334 --> 52:33.667
ask Me questions and allowed lot of time for it,

52:33.876 --> 52:38.626
because you see, when you are going through that process

52:38.834 --> 52:41.501
I don’t want your mind just to come like a jack in the box,

52:41.709 --> 52:46.667
to say something. So is better to keep that mind little bit silent,

52:46.876 --> 52:49.083
I said, "All right, you can ask Me questions".

52:49.292 --> 52:52.125
But these questions, whether I answer them or not,

52:52.334 --> 52:54.292
or whether they satisfy you or not,

52:54.501 --> 52:56.999
whether you ask questions or not, makes no differences.

52:57.167 --> 52:59.250
Because this is all mental feats.

52:59.459 --> 53:02.167
It is beyond the mind, Kundalini takes you.

53:02.375 --> 53:05.584
So, what important thing is, that you must desire

53:05.792 --> 53:07.334
to get your Self-Realization.

53:07.584 --> 53:08.999
If you do not desire it,

53:09.209 --> 53:11.459
if you do not want it, I cannot force on you.

53:11.751 --> 53:15.792
This is the biggest problem. You cannot force on anyone.

53:15.999 --> 53:18.834
You have to desire it and ask for it, humbly.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.417
If you are saying, that,

53:21.667 --> 53:24.292
"No, I won't have it". So, I would request you

53:24.501 --> 53:27.334
that you better go and not disturb others.

53:27.584 --> 53:32.667
Because is something that cannot work against your free will.

53:33.292 --> 53:36.876
That’s the free choice, as you say. Is that is the free choice,

53:37.042 --> 53:40.083
that till that point, you have a free choice

53:40.292 --> 53:43.250
whether to ask for it or not.

53:44.334 --> 53:48.584
Now, there are two conditions, as I told yesterday.

53:49.167 --> 53:51.417
The first one is that,

53:51.667 --> 53:54.876
we have to forgive ourselves fully.

53:55.042 --> 53:58.167
We are not to feel guilty, at all.

53:58.375 --> 54:00.292
Absolutely, we are human beings,

54:00.501 --> 54:02.999
and human beings are the only ones who commit mistakes.

54:03.167 --> 54:05.709
Gods are not going to commit mistakes.

54:05.918 --> 54:09.792
So, if we commit mistakes, doesn’t matter.

54:10.209 --> 54:15.417
But as I told you, the generosity and the forgiveness

54:16.626 --> 54:18.792
of the Divine is so tremendous.

54:18.999 --> 54:23.375
that whatever you have done wrong, is easily forgiven.

54:24.167 --> 54:28.501
Divine is anxious that you should get your Realization.

54:29.292 --> 54:31.125
Very anxious.

54:31.334 --> 54:34.250
So, you don’t now put down yourself,

54:34.459 --> 54:36.501
by saying, "I am guilty, I've done this,

54:36.709 --> 54:38.834
I've done that or I've committed sin.

54:38.999 --> 54:41.542
These ideas should not come into your head at all.

54:41.751 --> 54:44.959
There is nothing like sin, when you are in the present.

54:45.125 --> 54:48.959
So forget the past and forget what you think you have done wrong.

54:49.125 --> 54:53.626
Also you have to forgive the people, all the people, in general.

54:53.834 --> 54:56.709
Not to remember whom you have to forgive, why you have to forgive,

54:56.918 --> 54:58.792
but just in general you just forgive.

54:58.999 --> 55:01.626
It's such a great relief you don't know, if you will forgive.

55:01.876 --> 55:04.042
This Agnya chakra just releases.

55:04.250 --> 55:07.292
If you just say, "I forgive everyone", it opens out,

55:07.501 --> 55:11.209
and it's so good, that once

55:11.417 --> 55:13.667
you have forgiven, then Kundalini just shoots off.

55:13.876 --> 55:17.167
But most of the time I have seen, when they come to Me, meet Me,

55:17.375 --> 55:19.626
Then I have to tell them, “Please forgive, please forgive,

55:19.834 --> 55:21.834
please forgive” and then it works out.

55:21.999 --> 55:26.626
It makes it easier, just you, just forgive everyone.

55:26.959 --> 55:29.417
As it is, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

55:29.667 --> 55:32.626
you don't do anything, do you? Nothing.

55:32.834 --> 55:36.292
What happens? It’s just a myth.

55:36.501 --> 55:39.042
Just a myth. But if you don’t forgive,

55:39.250 --> 55:41.250
then you play into wrong hands.

55:41.626 --> 55:43.999
The other person, who has troubled you or tortured you

55:44.167 --> 55:45.918
is quite happy, but you are tortured,

55:46.083 --> 55:48.167
you are playing into the hands of such a person.

55:48.375 --> 55:50.042
So best thing is to forgive.

55:50.250 --> 55:53.667
Forgiveness is a very important in Sahaja Yoga.

55:53.959 --> 55:57.751
So, I would request you to forgive everyone, before starting this.

55:57.959 --> 56:00.459
Is a very simple thing, which one has to do,

56:00.667 --> 56:03.667
is that we'll take out our shoes.

56:03.876 --> 56:07.959
Those who are upstairs, can come down, will be better.

56:23.417 --> 56:28.000
There are seats in front also, if some people want to come.

56:43.959 --> 56:46.667
All right?

56:47.000 --> 56:48.542
Just put some water.

56:48.751 --> 56:52.250
Will you show them there? All right, just a minute.

56:57.626 --> 57:03.125
Just move down. There are some people who are waiting, to come in.

57:30.042 --> 57:33.834
Now, Frank will show you,

57:34.000 --> 57:38.626
how we are going to raise our own Kundalinis.

57:39.334 --> 57:41.959
It's very simple method

57:42.125 --> 57:45.125
to understand, very simple.

57:45.334 --> 57:48.042
First of all, you put your left hand towards Me,

57:48.250 --> 57:53.250
which represents your wish, your desire to get Self-Realization.

57:53.459 --> 57:56.501
Just please put it, left hand like that. Be comfortable.

57:56.751 --> 57:58.417
You need not sit with a slouch,

57:58.667 --> 58:01.042
you need not put with a very, too much straight.

58:01.250 --> 58:04.209
Just simple.

58:05.417 --> 58:08.459
So, left hand, we put like this, and with the right hand

58:08.709 --> 58:10.999
we nourish our centers on the left hand side,

58:11.167 --> 58:13.459
nourish our centers on the left hand side.

58:14.083 --> 58:17.125
Put both the feet apart from each other.

58:18.292 --> 58:21.792
Now, put your right hand on your heart,

58:21.999 --> 58:25.876
because right hand stands for action, or the power of action.

58:26.083 --> 58:30.459
On the heart. Here resides the Spirit, as I told you.

58:30.918 --> 58:33.125
Then we have to put our right hand

58:33.334 --> 58:36.000
in the upper portion of our abdomen.

58:36.250 --> 58:37.709
Just now, you see all this,

58:37.918 --> 58:41.459
and later on you will close your eyes and follow it.

58:42.626 --> 58:44.959
We have to work only on the left hand side.

58:45.125 --> 58:48.250
In the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left hand side.

58:48.584 --> 58:50.834
Then we take down our right hand

58:51.000 --> 58:53.999
in the lower portion of our abdomen.

59:02.999 --> 59:06.584
This is the center which manifests

59:08.918 --> 59:13.167
the divinity on our central nervous system.

59:13.667 --> 59:19.792
That means we become knowledgeable, gnostics, the bodha.

59:21.167 --> 59:23.459
Now, you have to rise your hand in the upper portion

59:23.667 --> 59:25.209
of your abdomen.

59:25.417 --> 59:28.209
Now, this is the center,

59:28.417 --> 59:31.792
which is the center of mastery.

59:33.000 --> 59:39.292
Great saints, prophets, have created this special center for us,

59:39.709 --> 59:42.792
so we have to enlighten this one also.

59:42.999 --> 59:47.417
Then we take our right hand on our heart.

59:49.999 --> 59:52.999
As I told you, this is the center of our Spirit.

59:53.417 --> 59:55.250
Then we take our hand

59:55.459 --> 59:58.918
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder,

59:59.083 --> 01:00:01.959
and put our right hand on the back side of it

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:04.125
and turn our head to our right.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:09.918
This is the center which is disturbed when we feel guilty.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:16.000
Then we take our right hand

01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:19.626
onto our forehead across,

01:00:19.876 --> 01:00:22.417
and push it down as much as we can.

01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:24.292
Allow the head to rest on it.

01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:28.250
Now press it on both the sides.

01:00:34.876 --> 01:00:38.626
This is the center to forgive others.

01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:43.459
Take down our hand. Take up on the back side

01:00:43.709 --> 01:00:49.792
of our head and put our head resting on it, upward.

01:00:51.626 --> 01:00:56.125
This is the center to ask for forgiveness from Divine,

01:00:56.334 --> 01:00:59.000
without feeling guilty.

01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:02.042
Then we stretch our hand,

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.999
we stretch our palm.

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:06.375
The center of our palm

01:01:06.584 --> 01:01:09.209
we put it

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:12.918
on the fontanel bone area.

01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:20.375
And bend our head, as much as we can.

01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:24.626
Now, push back your fingers. Please, push back your fingers,

01:01:24.834 --> 01:01:29.918
so there is a sufficient pressure on your scalp.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:34.501
And now you have to move your scalp seven times,

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.834
very slowly, clockwise.

01:02:01.209 --> 01:02:04.250
Now, it’s done.

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:07.709
That’s all we have to do.

01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:12.542
You can take out, take down your spectacles if you want,

01:02:12.751 --> 01:02:14.667
because sometimes even eyesight improves.

01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:16.626
And now you have to close your eyes.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:19.792
Untill I tell you please, don’t open them. Please, don’t open them.

01:02:19.999 --> 01:02:22.667
Remember to keep your feet apart from each other,

01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:25.834
and just this left hand like this.

01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:33.834
Like this, bend you head, push back your fingers,

01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:39.459
and move your scalp like this, seven times, slowly.

01:02:40.999 --> 01:02:43.000
This is important. You push back your fingers,

01:02:43.209 --> 01:02:46.834
then there is a pressure, and you can do it much better. All right?

01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:50.417
Now, let’s see.

01:02:52.959 --> 01:02:54.334
Please, close your eyes!

01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:56.792
But you should be pleasantly pleased towards yourself.

01:02:56.999 --> 01:02:58.959
You have to forgive yourself and you have to be

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:01.584
very pleasantly placed towards yourselves.

01:03:01.792 --> 01:03:04.999
Not to be angry with yourself, that is very important.

01:03:05.209 --> 01:03:07.334
Now, put your left hand towards Me

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:11.167
and right hand on your heart.

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:18.250
Close your eyes, please!

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:24.792
Here, you have to ask Me a question.

01:03:25.999 --> 01:03:28.876
As you ask a computer, you have to ask a question.

01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:33.501
You can call me Shri Mataji or you can call me Mother,

01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:36.209
”Mother, am I the Spirit?“

01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:38.751
Ask this question in your heart three times.

01:03:38.959 --> 01:03:41.083
Not loudly, in your heart,  three times,

01:03:41.292 --> 01:03:44.042
”Mother, am I the Spirit?“

01:03:44.375 --> 01:03:46.709
It's a very important question.

01:04:03.751 --> 01:04:05.584
Now,

01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:11.209
you take down your hand,

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:13.375
onto the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:16.250
on the left hand side and press it hard.

01:04:16.834 --> 01:04:20.876
If you are the Spirit, you are your master.

01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:25.751
So now ask another question to Me, three times, in your heart,

01:04:26.334 --> 01:04:28.999
”Mother,

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.292
am I my own master?

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.501
Mother, am I my own guru?”

01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:37.167
Ask this question three times.

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:02.918
As I've told you, I cannot

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:08.584
cross over your freedom, which I respect.

01:05:08.834 --> 01:05:12.209
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:05:12.417 --> 01:05:13.876
You have to ask for it.

01:05:14.042 --> 01:05:15.834
So, now, please, put your right hand

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.042
in the low portion of your abdomen,

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.876
on the left hand side.

01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:25.501
And ask

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.709
“Mother,

01:05:30.584 --> 01:05:32.751
please, give me pure knowledge!”

01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:37.375
Say it six times, because this center has got six petals.

01:05:37.626 --> 01:05:41.042
So please say, “Mother, please,

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:45.167
give Me pure knowledge”.

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:53.584
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:05:53.792 --> 01:05:57.459
there's movement in your Kundalini, which you may not feel.

01:05:57.667 --> 01:06:01.751
It's rising, so we have to

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:09.042
nourish the higher centers, with our self-confidence.

01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:14.792
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:17.334
in the left hand side, on the left hand side,

01:06:17.626 --> 01:06:22.501
and here you say with full confidence

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:25.626
ten times,

01:06:26.959 --> 01:06:30.834
“Mother, I am my own master“.

01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:32.751
It's very good

01:06:32.959 --> 01:06:37.417
for people who have been specially tortured by other gurus.

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:42.125
”Mother, I am my own master”. Please, say it ten times.

01:06:58.501 --> 01:07:02.125
So now, raise your right hand

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:14.792
onto your heart, where resides the Spirit.

01:07:14.999 --> 01:07:16.999
And the Spirit

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:22.876
is the state, to which you have to rise.

01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:27.167
With full confidence now, raising your hand

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:31.167
to your heart, with full confidence,

01:07:32.125 --> 01:07:33.999
you have to say,

01:07:34.209 --> 01:07:37.501
“Mother I am the Spirit.

01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:43.709
Mother, I am the Spirit”. Say it twelve times, please.

01:07:55.792 --> 01:07:59.083
The Divine is the ocean

01:07:59.292 --> 01:08:03.751
of knowledge and love.

01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:10.584
It is the ocean of bliss and peace,

01:08:10.999 --> 01:08:15.250
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:19.834
So you cannot do anything, which cannot be forgiven

01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:24.167
by that great power of forgiveness.

01:08:25.626 --> 01:08:28.167
So now, you raise your right hand

01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:30.667
in the corner of your neck

01:08:30.876 --> 01:08:32.918
and your shoulder,

01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:35.125
push it back as much as you can,

01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:38.209
and turn your head to your right.

01:08:39.999 --> 01:08:43.709
Here you have to say sixteen times,

01:08:43.918 --> 01:08:46.209
with full confidence,

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:48.834
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all”.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.792
Please, say it with full confidence.

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:07.125
I’ve already told you,

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:10.083
that whether we forgive someone

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:12.626
or don't forgive, we don't do anything.

01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:16.792
But if we don’t forgive, then we play into wrong hands.

01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:19.999
So, please, now,

01:09:20.334 --> 01:09:23.209
raise your hand to your forehead

01:09:26.876 --> 01:09:30.501
and put down your head, slowly.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.626
Let it rest on your hand

01:09:34.834 --> 01:09:38.292
and press it hard on both the sides.

01:09:40.999 --> 01:09:46.250
This is the center where we have to forgive everyone.

01:09:46.459 --> 01:09:49.709
So, please, say it from your heart,

01:09:49.999 --> 01:09:53.417
from your heart, not how many times,

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:58.250
“Mother, I forgive everyone”. Is very important!

01:09:58.459 --> 01:10:00.834
Please, say this, from your heart.

01:10:00.999 --> 01:10:02.834
Open your heart and say,

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:06.417
“Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:16.792
Now, take back your right hand

01:10:16.999 --> 01:10:19.876
on the back side of your head,

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:23.834
and turn in upward as far as possible.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.125
Let it rest on your hand.

01:10:28.999 --> 01:10:31.417
Here, without feeling guilty,

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:34.250
without counting your mistakes,

01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:37.375
without blaming yourselves for anything,

01:10:37.626 --> 01:10:39.834
just for your satisfaction,

01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:42.876
you have to say in your heart,

01:10:43.042 --> 01:10:46.584
opening your heart, not how many times,

01:10:46.834 --> 01:10:48.417
“Oh Divine,

01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:51.375
if I have done any mistake, please forgive me”.

01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:53.792
In humility you have to say,

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:59.000
“Oh, Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please, forgive me.”

01:11:10.751 --> 01:11:15.667
Now, stretch your palm, right hand palm,

01:11:15.876 --> 01:11:20.250
please, and put the center of your palm

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:24.709
on your fontanel bone area,

01:11:24.959 --> 01:11:27.876
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:31.999
Now, put down your head, as far as possible.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:36.584
Now press it hard, push back your fingers nicely,

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.125
press it hard

01:11:38.334 --> 01:11:42.417
and you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise.

01:11:42.626 --> 01:11:49.125
But again, here, I cannot cross over your freedom,

01:11:49.334 --> 01:11:50.876
which I respect.

01:11:51.042 --> 01:11:53.792
So, you will have to say,

01:11:53.999 --> 01:11:57.292
“Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization”.

01:11:57.584 --> 01:12:01.042
I cannot force on you. Please, say it seven times,

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:05.584
“Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization!”

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.209
Push back your fingers please, push back your fingers. Move it.

01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:15.334
Put down your heads. Put down your heads.

01:12:41.999 --> 01:12:44.375
Now, please, take
down your hands.

01:12:44.584 --> 01:12:46.626
Open your eyes, slowly.

01:12:46.834 --> 01:12:50.834
Put the hands towards Me, like this.

01:12:51.999 --> 01:12:54.751
Now, put down,

01:12:54.959 --> 01:12:57.834
push your hand, right hand like this towards Me,

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.792
and put down your head,

01:12:59.999 --> 01:13:02.000
and see for yourself with the left hand,

01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:04.959
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:06.918
May be little hot, doesn’t matter.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:10.542
But it will be some sort of a heat or a cool

01:13:10.751 --> 01:13:13.125
coming out of your head.

01:13:13.334 --> 01:13:16.584
You have to certify yourself.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.209
Don’t worry about the air conditioning.

01:13:19.417 --> 01:13:20.959
It's coming out of your head.

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:23.667
Now, put the left hand towards Me

01:13:23.876 --> 01:13:26.000
and put your right and again

01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:27.584
and see for yourself,

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:31.876
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:40.501
Now change over again, once more.

01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:44.959
Put the right hand towards Me and put down your head,

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:48.834
and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze,

01:13:49.083 --> 01:13:53.083
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:56.209
You have to put it above, not on it.

01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:59.584
Above, some people can have it

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:03.042
little far away, some will have it closer.

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:07.167
But you don’t have to touch your head.

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:11.667
Now,

01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:14.709
push back both your hands.

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:18.250
Raise them, raise them like this.

01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:21.792
Push back your head,

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.834
and ask the question,

01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:29.083
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:33.876
"Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of God’s love?"

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:36.000
"Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

01:14:36.209 --> 01:14:40.083
Ask this question, one of them, three times.

01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:45.292
Keep your eyes upward and ask this question.

01:14:52.959 --> 01:14:55.751
Now, take down your hands.

01:14:56.584 --> 01:14:59.292
Just keep them.

01:14:59.584 --> 01:15:03.083
Try to watch Me without thinking. You can do it.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.667
You feel very relaxed.

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:08.918
You can put on your glasses, if you like.

01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:17.125
Just put your hands towards Me like this.

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:24.375
Those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head

01:15:24.626 --> 01:15:28.626
or on their fingertips, whether hot or cold,

01:15:28.834 --> 01:15:31.751
please, raise both your hands.

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:40.584
Practically, all of you have felt it.

01:15:40.959 --> 01:15:43.999
May God bless you! Just imagine!

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:49.792
I bow to all the saints.

01:15:49.999 --> 01:15:54.876
Now, you have to just know how to establish it

01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:58.334
and to work it out. It's very simple.

01:15:58.584 --> 01:16:00.834
You have a very good center here,

01:16:00.999 --> 01:16:04.501
where people will tell you all about it.

01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:06.626
There is nothing to be paid for,

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:09.250
just you have to give little time to yourself

01:16:09.459 --> 01:16:13.250
and you must respect your Self-Realization.

01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:17.209
Gradually, you will grow into it. And I hope next year,

01:16:17.417 --> 01:16:20.959
I will see you here as big trees grown.

01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:22.999
Very happy to meet you all.

01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:25.459
All those who have not felt it

01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:28.999
can come on one side and the Sahaja Yogis can see them;

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:34.250
And those who have felt it, I would like to meet them, one by one.

01:16:35.584 --> 01:16:38.292
I’d like to shake hands.

01:16:48.667 --> 01:16:51.292
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:16:51.876 --> 01:16:53.792
SM: So now...
P:  [unclear] Mother, is lovely.

01:16:53.999 --> 01:16:56.999
SM: Lovely. Now, you are lovely, you are fantastic,

01:16:57.167 --> 01:16:59.792
and now you have to establish it. You must establish,

01:16:59.999 --> 01:17:02.792
give some time. All right? Don't neglect it,

01:17:02.999 --> 01:17:04.667
because, unless and until you establish it,

01:17:04.876 --> 01:17:06.417
you cannot become the master of it.

01:17:06.626 --> 01:17:09.751
And it takes at the most one month, just to establish it.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.959
All right? So you meet these people.

01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:13.834
Where is the center, you just announce.

01:17:13.999 --> 01:17:16.626
Lovely. Thank you, you help us.

01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:23.834
So, you got it?

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:27.751
So you really got, really got it.

01:17:28.876 --> 01:17:31.999
Oh, he's very cool and nice.

01:17:38.959 --> 01:17:42.709
May God bless you! It’s your own, it’s your own.

P: Yes. Thank you very much!

01:18:04.626 --> 01:18:07.209

So this is finished now?

01:19:26.042 --> 01:19:27.834
If You are bored You can just throw it away.

01:19:27.999 --> 01:19:30.876
All right. It's all right. I know I told you it's not true.

01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:33.751

May God bless you. Now you must give some time to yourself.

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:50.375
That's important, isn't it?

01:19:50.584 --> 01:19:53.584
Yes, you should, you should look after yourself.

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:57.792
No more troubles, no more diseases, no more doctors.

01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:03.751
May God bless you!

01:20:03.959 --> 01:20:05.834
SM: Yes, just come!
P: I'll have to.

01:20:05.999 --> 01:20:09.000
Yes, yes. They have. We have a tour in India,

01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:12.417
we too have a tour. So, if you want to come,

01:20:12.667 --> 01:20:15.000
you can find out from these people.

01:20:24.334 --> 01:20:26.876
Oh, God! Good.

01:20:48.999 --> 01:20:50.999
May God bless you!

01:20:59.918 --> 01:21:02.334
When I put my hand up the first time, I felt it.

01:21:02.501 --> 01:21:05.751
and when I took it away it had gone. Is that fine?

01:21:06.459 --> 01:21:09.083
You know, when I put it up, I felt it, right?

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:11.042
and it [unclear].

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.792
And then when I put it back it was gone. What had happen?

01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:16.209
It doesn't stay if you are thinking about it! Just don't think.

01:21:16.417 --> 01:21:18.834
You should not think about it and argue about it

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:21.626
or discuss about it. Then you come to your mental level.

01:21:21.834 --> 01:21:23.876
It is higher level than that, that’s why you lost it.

01:21:24.042 --> 01:21:26.125
Now, don’t think about it, you can’t think about it.

01:21:26.334 --> 01:21:28.876
You see, you did it without thinking.

01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:30.876
So keep to that state.

01:21:31.042 --> 01:21:32.834
Thank You.

01:21:32.999 --> 01:21:35.834
P: Namaste Mother. Forgive me.

01:21:37.334 --> 01:21:42.250

01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:44.292
[Hindi]

01:21:44.501 --> 01:21:48.292
[Hindi]

01:21:49.167 --> 01:21:52.626
[Hindi]

01:21:53.584 --> 01:21:55.667
Namaste!
Namaste!

01:21:55.876 --> 01:21:57.918

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:00.292
P: I sort tried to forgive the [unclear].

01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:03.999

01:22:04.167 --> 01:22:05.999
SM: Forgive?
P:The [unclear].

01:22:06.292 --> 01:22:09.959

P: Thank you I hope we are a forest

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:15.167
of tall trees next time You visit.

01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:18.918
SM: Yes, we have to see. Is already described that.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:22.125
And there's a poem that: “Come along the forest

01:22:22.334 --> 01:22:24.584
of [great] trees of giving blessing. Like that.

01:22:24.792 --> 01:22:27.459
There's a Marathi poem like that describing you all,

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:30.334
as the oceans of love,

01:22:30.501 --> 01:22:32.125
which speak.

01:22:32.334 --> 01:22:35.375
Beautiful descriptions, there is about you, people.

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:41.667
P: I was wondering, we used [unclear] woman,

01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:43.876
not to shake hands but just
kiss them on the cheek.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:46.999
SM: All right. It is all right. You are My son.

01:22:49.459 --> 01:22:52.334
SM: You are My child.
P: We actually try and tell other people.

01:22:52.584 --> 01:22:54.876
SM: Please do, please do and bring them along.

01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:57.167
We have a center here, luckily, very good center,

01:22:57.375 --> 01:22:58.375
which we work it on.

01:22:58.584 --> 01:23:01.501
I had a friend, he was very closed to a

01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:03.042
one of the seekers who...

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:05.584
Yes. There are so many. There are so many lost.

01:23:05.792 --> 01:23:07.876
[unclear] incarnation but that is part of...

01:23:08.042 --> 01:23:10.459
Yes, that is there. It's a part of it.

01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:12.709
They'll tell you all about it. All right?

01:23:12.959 --> 01:23:15.667

We are having a nice center there in South Africa, so many.

At least they were saying about one thousand people in South Africa

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:33.751
doing Sahaja Yoga. It's very good.

01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:38.459
Enjoy yourself now.

01:24:41.417 --> 01:24:42.918

P: Gujarat and stays in India.

P: Yes, but I am in New Zealand.

P: I've asked to be guided for many years for the right teacher.

I've asked for many years to be guided

01:25:09.876 --> 01:25:12.626
to the right teacher and I feel I've got it now.

01:25:12.876 --> 01:25:15.918
SM: Now, there are people who will make you a teacher yourself.

01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:18.792
And you should get it more people. You are from India?

You are all beautiful. You just know your own beauty now.

It’s time for you to know your beauty and glory.

01:26:09.334 --> 01:26:11.999
So, now, how are you?

Here's another one, a great seeker here.

May God bless you!

01:26:28.959 --> 01:26:30.667

01:26:41.999 --> 01:26:45.334
P:What I want to know, is why didn't I want to seek a long time ago?

01:26:45.751 --> 01:26:48.999
Why didn't I want to seek a long time ago?

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:52.667
Why now? I can't understand that.

01:26:52.918 --> 01:26:56.501
SM: I'm sorry for that. I know but

01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:59.334
it is the time, has to come.

01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:01.125
It has to ripe.

I was here many times before,

01:27:05.042 --> 01:27:08.375

01:28:40.501 --> 01:28:42.334

All right? He is not a right person.

01:28:51.751 --> 01:28:53.999

01:29:20.042 --> 01:29:23.083
[Hindi]

01:29:23.292 --> 01:29:27.167
[hindi]

01:29:28.584 --> 01:29:32.083
[Hindi]

01:29:32.292 --> 01:29:33.667
[Hindi]

01:29:33.876 --> 01:29:35.999
Do You think I should go there and [unclear].

01:29:36.167 --> 01:29:37.918
SM: Where ? P: Over there.

01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:40.709
SM: Of course, of course.

01:29:42.167 --> 01:29:46.250
[Jane Lee] In the process I felt something here and afterwards.

01:29:46.459 --> 01:29:49.999
SM: Liver. You didn't forgive my child. You have to forgive.

01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:53.959
That's something I've been requested you all. Just forgive.

01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:57.709
That's why you felt it there. Now is better?

01:30:00.042 --> 01:30:01.626
All right? Got it.

01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:05.834
So there's only little thing you didn't do, is to forgive.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.999
Thank You.

01:30:10.209 --> 01:30:12.876
SM: How are you?
P: My son has previously [unclear]

01:30:13.042 --> 01:30:16.542
again, You want again to go? [unclear]

01:30:16.751 --> 01:30:20.876
I wish I could go sometimes to all these places. May God bless you.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:23.918
So now...

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:29.125
You got it very well? Isn't it ? Feel it?

01:30:29.417 --> 01:30:32.918
Yes, yes. I can see on your face. The eyes are dilatated.

01:30:33.083 --> 01:30:35.125
There's a sparkle in the eyes when you get your Realization.

01:30:35.334 --> 01:30:38.167
P: Before I came in, I had warm from my hands anyway.

01:30:38.375 --> 01:30:40.167
SM: And now is good.

01:30:40.375 --> 01:30:42.834
Yes, that's correct.

01:30:42.999 --> 01:30:45.375
I'm still trying to feel it correctly.

01:30:45.584 --> 01:30:48.000
Yes, you should. You should try to meet these people

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:49.626
and just establish yourself.

01:30:49.834 --> 01:30:53.626
P: My mother is member of your group, and so is Katrina.

01:30:53.918 --> 01:30:55.667
SM: Really?
P: She’s my daughter.

01:30:55.876 --> 01:30:58.751
Oh, good, very nice.

01:31:00.167 --> 01:31:01.959
SM: Hello sir. P: Nice to meet you.

01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:04.417
May God bless you.

01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:06.125
Nice to meet you!

01:31:06.334 --> 01:31:08.125
P: When do You come to New Zealand again?

01:31:08.334 --> 01:31:10.334
SM: Next year?
P: Next year.

01:31:15.999 --> 01:31:18.542
[Hindi]

01:31:18.751 --> 01:31:21.667
[Hindi]

01:31:23.083 --> 01:31:26.167
[Hindi]

01:31:26.375 --> 01:31:28.125
P: Thank you very much.
SM: May God bless you!

01:31:28.334 --> 01:31:31.959
So, now, it is all right.
P: It was very nice to receive

01:31:32.125 --> 01:31:35.167
Your powerful talks. Thank You!

01:31:35.375 --> 01:31:38.417
SM: It is power of Love, my child, it is just power of Love.

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.501
Nothing more than that. All right?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
May God bless you!

01:31:43.501 --> 01:31:46.417
Thank You very much. It was lovely. And now is available.

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:48.709
I don't know what I felt [unclear].

01:31:48.918 --> 01:31:51.667
Now, you must forgive, that is the point, you see.

01:31:51.876 --> 01:31:53.542
If you don’t forgive, you won’t feel it.

01:31:53.751 --> 01:31:55.626
You have to forgive from your heart.

01:31:55.834 --> 01:31:59.083
Just now, you see? Better?

01:31:59.459 --> 01:32:01.918
P: Yes, yes.
SM: You have to forgive.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.417
P: Yes, thank You.

01:32:03.626 --> 01:32:06.042
SM: That's the only thing you have to do is to forgive.

01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:07.834
It's a bit too much now. How are you?

01:32:07.999 --> 01:32:09.584
Thank You for an interesting talk.

01:32:09.792 --> 01:32:11.751
Now, you must come and see them, all right?

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:15.626
And achieve it and get boys of your age group. Very important!

01:32:15.834 --> 01:32:18.167
You know there's an attack, a negative attack .

01:32:18.375 --> 01:32:19.918
coming to your country. You must know that.

01:32:20.083 --> 01:32:22.334
Drugs, this, that, all kinds of things.

01:32:22.584 --> 01:32:25.667
P: Thank You very much. It was lovely. Thank You.

01:32:32.292 --> 01:32:34.459
P: You'll help me to help myself?

01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:36.792
SM: Yes, you will. You just go and see them.

01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:40.918
SM: You will help yourself and you help others also.

01:32:44.167 --> 01:32:46.709
[unclear]

01:32:46.918 --> 01:32:49.459
Hot. You must forgive, just forgive.

01:32:49.834 --> 01:32:53.792
Forgive. Is important to forgive.

01:32:55.375 --> 01:32:57.334
Just forgive!

01:32:57.792 --> 01:32:59.792
Better?

01:33:03.999 --> 01:33:06.834
SM: You are from where?
P: I'm from New Zealand.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.876
SM: From where.
P: New Zealand. I'm from India.

01:33:10.042 --> 01:33:11.709
SM: From where? P: From Bombay.

01:33:11.918 --> 01:33:13.167
SM: From Bombay?

01:33:13.375 --> 01:33:15.000
P: But I've been here long time.

01:33:15.209 --> 01:33:17.876
I have come when I was ten and I've been here 40 years now.

01:33:18.042 --> 01:33:21.667
SM: Really?
P: Yes, but I have problems with my own children.

01:33:21.876 --> 01:33:24.626
SM: They will be all right. Now you first of all learn all these things.

01:33:24.834 --> 01:33:26.667
Yes. Then you can solve all the problems.

01:33:26.876 --> 01:33:29.751
First you learn it, you become a master and then you can manage.

01:33:29.959 --> 01:33:31.584
All right? May God Bless you.

01:33:31.792 --> 01:33:34.167
P: That's my daughter.
SM: How are you?

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:37.709
All right! You're all right. Forgive!

01:33:38.292 --> 01:33:40.501
Just you forgive!

01:33:41.334 --> 01:33:43.626
What is there at such a young age you don’t forgive?

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:46.918
You must forgive now. Even the old people have forgiven.

01:33:47.083 --> 01:33:48.709
Right?

01:33:48.918 --> 01:33:50.709
Now better.

01:33:50.918 --> 01:33:53.167
All right?

01:33:53.792 --> 01:33:56.626
P: Thank you.
SM: Go and see them.

01:33:56.834 --> 01:33:59.959
P: Thank you! We saw You in two classes in London

01:34:00.125 --> 01:34:01.999
and to see You here is a wonderful thing.

01:34:02.167 --> 01:34:04.000
SM: Really? When was that?

01:34:04.209 --> 01:34:07.626
P: I don't know, we just attended two of your two classes in London.

01:34:07.834 --> 01:34:09.334
SM: Oh, I see, the courses.

01:34:09.501 --> 01:34:11.250
P: And the course is in Wimbledon.

01:34:11.459 --> 01:34:13.375
SM: This, just see,

01:34:13.584 --> 01:34:16.042
he has attended the courses in Wimbledon, he says.

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:17.501
Yes, good.

01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:20.709
P: So thank you for this marvelous gift and also Your coming.

01:34:20.918 --> 01:34:23.999
SM: Very good. Now you go and meet them. You are here or in London?

01:34:24.167 --> 01:34:26.918
P: We are living here.
SM: All right, that's very good.

01:34:27.083 --> 01:34:28.999
P: I've been enjoying listening to You.

01:34:29.167 --> 01:34:31.542
I was very interested as I have breast cancer.

01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:32.959
P: That's why I was interested to hear

01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:34.584
what You said about breast cancer.

01:34:34.792 --> 01:34:36.834
SM: Was that the reason?
P: Yes.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.626
P: What was that?
SM: Is that the reason, you are insecure?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.334
P: Yes, yes, there's nothing. I always think that You say it. Yes.

01:34:44.918 --> 01:34:48.709
SM: You have seen that?
P: No, no that's leaving me now.

01:34:48.918 --> 01:34:50.334
SM: Now it's all right. You'll be all right.

01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:51.959
Is that the reason?
P: Yes it is.

01:34:52.125 --> 01:34:54.459
It is the reason. That’s why in the West,

01:34:54.667 --> 01:34:57.918
see women are very insecure. And men must understand this,

01:34:58.083 --> 01:35:01.834
the way they go on with this woman, that woman.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.999
P: I don't, I believe that I can’t expect him to understand,

01:35:06.209 --> 01:35:08.834
but I understand it myself now and that's important.

01:35:08.999 --> 01:35:12.584
SM: It is better to be yourself. See that the whole joy is with you.

01:35:12.792 --> 01:35:15.999
P: Yes, I'll try. I understand that. Thank you.

01:35:19.417 --> 01:35:21.999
SM: So, now, how are you?
P: Very good. Thank You, Mother.

01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:24.999
You, great!

01:35:27.751 --> 01:35:29.459
Now you must develop it within yourself.

01:35:29.667 --> 01:35:31.375
So develop it. You become a master of it.

01:35:31.626 --> 01:35:33.542
It is very easy, it's very simple.

01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:36.501
Because is so innate within you so you just become that.

01:35:36.751 --> 01:35:39.959
But you must know how to manage it, how to give Realization,

01:35:40.125 --> 01:35:42.792
so you can help so many people.

01:35:45.751 --> 01:35:50.125
So how are you? Oh you, very good. Wonderful.

01:35:50.334 --> 01:35:53.501
P: What is there?
SM: You will see, the cool.

01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:59.709
SM: So, how are you?
P: I don't [put in] to understand.

01:35:59.918 --> 01:36:02.999
All right, now, that's a [unclear]. Did you forgive?

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:06.334
SM: Did you forgive everyone?
P: Yes.

01:36:06.584 --> 01:36:09.000
Really? No, you did not. Now forgive.

01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:12.459
Now forgive, before Me you better forgive. Forgive, forgive.

01:36:15.584 --> 01:36:17.959
Now,

01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:20.584
is there a cool breeze now?

01:36:20.792 --> 01:36:22.584
Now, you didn't forgive. Just forgive.

01:36:22.792 --> 01:36:25.626
Just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".  Just say that.

01:36:25.834 --> 01:36:28.999
Say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:36:34.876 --> 01:36:37.083
All right?

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:39.584
It's releasing now?

01:36:39.792 --> 01:36:41.667
Such a headache is over if you forgive.

01:36:41.876 --> 01:36:45.626
Why to carry this headache of not forgiving?

01:36:45.834 --> 01:36:47.459
Now, see?

01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:49.918
May God bless you!

01:36:51.125 --> 01:36:53.999
SM: So, how are you?
P: Good, good.

01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:58.709
SM: Please, forgive.
P: I got it stronger in one hand than in the other.

01:36:58.918 --> 01:37:02.501
SM: In this hand you had strong? Yes. What work you do?

01:37:02.999 --> 01:37:05.667
Brick liner. Brick liner.

01:37:05.876 --> 01:37:07.667
P: Brick liner.
SM: I didn't understand.

01:37:07.876 --> 01:37:10.292
P: Brick liner.
SM: Brick layer, brick layer.

01:37:10.667 --> 01:37:14.250
That’s a physical work. That’s why.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:22.209
Now, it's better now?

01:37:23.501 --> 01:37:26.000
May God bless you! Little, one goes into imbalance,

01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:28.042
because you are doing a physical work.

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:31.209
The left is less. So they will teach you how to get into balance.

01:37:31.292 --> 01:37:34.501
That's all. All right? May God bless you!
