WEBVTT

00:04.621 --> 00:07.916
I hope you all are meditating every morning

00:08.117 --> 00:11.129
and talking Sahaja Yoga, meeting each
other,

00:11.330 --> 00:18.552
and this is more to get together that we
should all discuss about Sahaja Yoga

00:18.753 --> 00:23.143
and find out what is the way we can do it
better.

00:23.344 --> 00:29.518
Morning time I was thinking that we can
allot it now to people

00:29.719 --> 00:32.219
who would like to have a sort of a,

00:32.420 --> 00:36.911
they call it a brain trust sort of a thing,
a conference. You could have it.

00:37.112 --> 00:41.433
Of course, day after tomorrow we are all
very free. I’m sorry,

00:41.634 --> 00:45.358
tomorrow is the Puja but day after tomorrow
we are free in the morning time

00:45.559 --> 00:50.231
and also ninth we are free. So you all
could discuss and talk about things

00:50.432 --> 00:56.236
and about what has happened in Satara
district

00:56.437 --> 01:03.071
and all those things can be discussed among
all of you and it can be established

01:03.272 --> 01:08.756
that we understand Sahaja Yoga properly
among ourselves.

01:08.957 --> 01:12.118
Many people do not know much about
Sahaja Yoga, especially ladies.

01:12.319 --> 01:14.639
I think they have to know quite a lot.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.066
They just think they are in Sahaja Yoga;
so they are floating

01:18.267 --> 01:26.226
with the big flow of water. That’s not
the way to know about Sahaja Yoga.

01:26.427 --> 01:29.895
Sahaja Yoga you must know precisely, must
know what is,

01:30.096 --> 01:33.886
what is there, what is not there. So I
would say that you could have a meeting

01:34.087 --> 01:38.322
tomorrow sometime or, I’m sorry, day after
tomorrow, sometime

01:38.523 --> 01:42.760
and could discuss about what is it and how
it helps you,

01:42.961 --> 01:47.848
what are the chakras are, any problems,
anything. We have all kinds of people here.

01:48.049 --> 01:50.895
So it should not be just entertainment
but it should be

01:51.096 --> 01:56.418
more sort of a morning session for learning
things.

01:58.869 --> 02:02.736
We have, now tomorrow is a very important
day for Puja.

02:02.937 --> 02:06.545
All of you are expected to come here for
the Puja

02:06.746 --> 02:15.828
and I’m sure that it will help you all
to achieve something in that Puja.

02:16.042 --> 02:18.983
As it is, you know that you have to go
beyond your thoughts

02:19.184 --> 02:24.648
to absorb the vibrations. In your thoughts
you get lost.

02:24.849 --> 02:28.625
but once you are above the thoughts you
get absorbed.

02:28.826 --> 02:33.881
Also most of the marriages have been fixed.
But some people unnecessarily

02:34.082 --> 02:41.905
giving way to their conditionings or maybe
unnecessary thinking and all that

02:42.106 --> 02:46.763
have tried to say “No” to certain people
without any rhyme and reason,

02:46.964 --> 02:50.214
without any rhyme and reason. So it is
nonsense.

02:50.415 --> 02:53.468
And such people, I would say, that should
not apply anymore

02:53.645 --> 02:57.041
because we have wasted so much time. Of
course, if they had some rhyme and reason

02:57.242 --> 02:59.966
one can understand but without rhyme and
reason if you say,

03:00.167 --> 03:04.379
“We don’t want to marry,” that mean it’s
quite insulting to the other party.

03:04.580 --> 03:09.542
So if you have just said “No” because you
feel it from your heart

03:09.743 --> 03:14.255
and from your brain and from your these
things, this is not the way to behave.

03:14.456 --> 03:18.780
And before saying “No” you should see Me
and I would request you, all of you,

03:18.981 --> 03:24.611
to meet your fiancés and see for yourself.
Even now there is time.

03:24.812 --> 03:28.966
But if there is no reason for saying “No”,

03:29.182 --> 03:36.323
if there is no understanding about any
point,

03:36.524 --> 03:41.413
it is better to decide it now than to decide
it later. Now I’ve been telling you.

03:41.614 --> 03:43.707
Of course, you have all the freedom
to do it.

03:43.908 --> 03:48.605
But for no rhyme and reason you have no
business to insult other people.

03:48.806 --> 03:53.852
So I would request you that even if you
have any objections, even now,

03:54.053 --> 03:56.772
please write it down and give it to Yogi
Mahajan.

03:56.973 --> 04:01.439
He has really worked very hard and you know
we have no choices.

04:01.615 --> 04:05.183
You see, it is very funny how so many
marriages have come up. I didn’t expect

04:05.384 --> 04:09.560
even to fix ten marriages,  because the age
and the heights

04:09.761 --> 04:14.915
and everything was so much from one
extreme to another extreme.

04:15.116 --> 04:19.676
Moreover, those ladies who have got
children and all that, it’s rather difficult

04:19.877 --> 04:24.670
because we find people who are not very
happy about the situation.

04:24.871 --> 04:28.926
So they should not feel bad about it.
We hope to see people

04:29.127 --> 04:33.245
who would love to have children. All such
people should come forward

04:33.446 --> 04:37.528
and they should marry women who have
children and look after them.

04:37.729 --> 04:42.733
But it’s difficult. In the same way for men
also, if they have

04:42.934 --> 04:46.721
some children or something, there is
a problem.

04:46.922 --> 04:50.538
But one should not feel bad about it.
One should know that we are here

04:50.739 --> 04:55.017
for our Sahaja Yoga, for our ascent, and we
have to rise higher.

04:55.218 --> 04:59.236
As it is, you know, one or two marriages
do fail in Sahaja Yoga

04:59.437 --> 05:03.905
and they create lot of problems for Me. But
is this the way are you helping Me?

05:04.106 --> 05:08.205
I am helping you in so many ways. Which
is the way are you going to help Me

05:08.406 --> 05:13.999
is to understand that if we are married
let us try to improve ourselves.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.959
Of course, I would say that certain
problems come only from one side,

05:19.160 --> 05:22.161
not from both the sides, but whatever it is

05:22.362 --> 05:25.977
we have to understand that these marriages
are not just for marriages

05:26.178 --> 05:31.392
but for something great, to create a new
progeny of realized souls,

05:31.593 --> 05:37.280
to emancipate human beings. There are many
saints who want to be born on this earth.

05:37.481 --> 05:45.379
So it is important that if you are married
in that understanding

05:45.580 --> 05:50.630
then you will try to see to the good points
of others and not the bad points,

05:50.831 --> 05:52.928
and should not see superficial things.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.775
If you are superficial it is better you
don’t marry.

05:55.945 --> 06:00.996
But if you have any depth then you should
understand you are marrying for something

06:01.197 --> 06:06.295
that is the concern of God’s work.

06:06.496 --> 06:10.835
I hope by this you’ll be able to sort out
many of your problems.

06:11.036 --> 06:14.424
And then some people when they get married
they just get headlong,

06:14.625 --> 06:20.831
absolutely get lost into it. This is the
another stupid conditioning of romanticism.

06:21.032 --> 06:24.882
You have married because you are in Sahaja
Yoga, you want to help the Sahaj Yoga,

06:25.083 --> 06:29.189
you would like to have a companion who
will be helpful in Sahaja Yoga.

06:29.390 --> 06:34.369
But they get so headlong into it that I’ve
seen many characters have been ruined

06:34.570 --> 06:39.462
and people have been spoilt. But in a way
it’s good because this is Last Judgment.

06:39.639 --> 06:44.928
If by marriage, by temptations, by wrong
doings, by conditionings,

06:45.129 --> 06:47.382
if you have to go out, you have to go out.

06:47.583 --> 06:53.804
I must tell you that also there’s very
little place in the kingdom of God.

06:54.005 --> 06:58.160
Unless and until you prove to be good
Sahaja Yogis there is no place for you.

06:58.361 --> 07:02.911
For mediocres there is no place. You have
to be serious, deep,

07:03.112 --> 07:08.278
seeking, dedicated Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise
you have no place.

07:08.479 --> 07:11.984
If you are playing around only with your
children, with your wife,

07:12.185 --> 07:15.938
then all right; go ahead with it. You have
to get out of that

07:16.139 --> 07:20.732
and you must know that my first and
foremost attention should be on Sahaja Yoga.

07:20.933 --> 07:22.868
That is so very important today.

07:23.069 --> 07:28.385
Formerly, that’s why people used to give
sanyasa to their disciples.

07:28.586 --> 07:33.244
No marriage, no children, no household.
Just be sanyasis.

07:33.445 --> 07:38.316
So complete dedication to the guru,
complete dedication to the work.

07:38.517 --> 07:42.658
But in Sahaja Yoga it is not so. Because
also I have given you realization

07:42.859 --> 07:46.359
so you can feel it within yourselves what
is important.

07:46.560 --> 07:51.247
If something goes wrong with you then
the vibrations also go down.

07:51.448 --> 07:57.420
Then also I have reports, say, from many
countries that people are very miserly.

07:57.621 --> 08:02.053
They do not donate for daily work.
Of course, you don’t have to pay Me

08:02.254 --> 08:05.319
but you must know that without donation
we cannot do anything,

08:05.520 --> 08:10.097
you cannot even buy a little thing like
that, and from where it has to come?

08:10.298 --> 08:14.036
Of course, as far as possible I’ve tried
to compensate

08:14.237 --> 08:16.823
but also you must know my husband is now
retiring.

08:17.055 --> 08:21.908
So I hope the whole, with his retirement,
the whole of Sahaja Yoga will not collapse.

08:22.109 --> 08:26.334
If you are such miserly people, only
worried about your money,

08:26.535 --> 08:32.084
you want to extract each and every pie you
spend, each and every

08:32.761 --> 08:38.736
little money you have given, then I must say
such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

08:38.937 --> 08:41.605
Such calculating people, nobody wants
to shell out.

08:41.797 --> 08:47.654
I mean, I’ve seen people, even if they give
a little bottle of, say, Limca to someone,

08:47.855 --> 08:51.491
they want to charge it. If you are that
miserly

08:51.692 --> 08:56.345
there is no place for miserly people
in the kingdom of God.

08:56.546 --> 09:01.307
You have to be generous, you have to look
after people, you have to love each other,

09:01.508 --> 09:06.716
you have to give presents to others and you
have to be very much giving.

09:06.917 --> 09:12.699
And in this I find that people will live in
a good house, they’ll have a good family,

09:12.900 --> 09:17.466
they will spend on their children, for
their holidays, for their education,

09:17.667 --> 09:20.783
for everything. But Sahaja Yoga, they
become very miserly.

09:20.984 --> 09:24.292
So they are still so conditioned. So this
is the Last Judgment.

09:24.493 --> 09:28.652
And you will be judged for everything
that you do for Sahaja Yoga.

09:28.853 --> 09:32.515
Is one has to be very careful as to how
you behave,

09:32.716 --> 09:36.521
what is your attitude is and how you should
change.

09:36.722 --> 09:40.568
Your attention is also very important,
if your attention is not there.

09:40.769 --> 09:45.367
I’ve seen some people still sitting
outside, talking to people, doing this.

09:45.568 --> 09:48.416
In between the program they just get up
and walk off.

09:48.617 --> 09:53.751
When there’s an, some, some artist is
sitting you are not to go like that.

09:53.952 --> 09:58.569
It’s an insult to the artist. I, I just sit
for hours together.

09:58.758 --> 10:02.967
And if I am supposed to be your Guru, you
must learn at least that much from Me,

10:03.168 --> 10:07.493
how to respect and where to respect. So
I have seen many people just getting up,

10:07.694 --> 10:11.726
walking, sleeping down, this, that. If you
are that kind

10:11.927 --> 10:14.045
then you should sit on the corner and just
disappear.

10:14.246 --> 10:17.860
Nobody should walk this way back and this
way. It’s not proper.

10:18.061 --> 10:23.012
There should be, if you go to your church,
do you do like that?

10:23.242 --> 10:30.067
Church which is based on falsehood?
While this is the church of truth.

10:30.268 --> 10:35.376
And the way people take things without
any discipline looks very funny.

10:35.577 --> 10:38.823
People start walking up and down, sitting
the way they like.

10:39.031 --> 10:42.323
There’s no alertness about them.
This is all…

10:42.524 --> 10:47.312
You must know when the music is on,
I am trying to spread

10:47.513 --> 10:51.490
vibrations through that music. But some
people are dozing off.

10:51.691 --> 10:56.493
Some people are walking about. That is not
a Sahaja Yogi.

10:56.694 --> 11:00.136
You have to be just Spartan and smart.

11:00.337 --> 11:04.538
Like any, if you see a saint, you see,
if you see old saints we had,

11:04.739 --> 11:08.608
their disciples used to be sitting straight
before him for hours together.

11:08.777 --> 11:11.794
Of course, I don’t say that you should sit
here hours together

11:11.995 --> 11:16.410
but if I am sitting here you have no
business to behave like this dog

11:16.611 --> 11:20.552
that runs about without knowing what
he’s doing.

11:22.261 --> 11:26.304
We are all human beings and there’s no,
no reasoning behind it.

11:26.505 --> 11:29.478
I don’t understand - And there’s no
explanation needed.

11:29.679 --> 11:31.659
It’s the behavior itself is wrong.

11:31.860 --> 11:35.973
Now anybody who has children and all that
should sit on the other side.

11:36.174 --> 11:39.100
I would not like you to carry your children
here and there

11:39.277 --> 11:40.679
when there is some program is going on.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.903
We have to show at least this much
of discipline.

11:44.104 --> 11:48.445
So yesterday’s program was a little bit
a farce, perhaps maybe because

11:48.646 --> 11:53.214
some people really behaved in a manner
that they should not have behaved.

11:53.415 --> 11:57.236
All such people who want to go like that
should wait

11:57.437 --> 12:02.163
because in between the program we’ll give
you some interval when you can go out.

12:02.364 --> 12:08.176
So let us have a society, a proper

12:09.663 --> 12:18.417
beautifully built-up collectivity which
shows that we are very saintly people.

12:18.618 --> 12:22.383
We have poise, we have adjustments, we have
understanding,

12:22.584 --> 12:27.465
we are doing everything in such a manner
that it is all dignified.

12:27.666 --> 12:33.050
Now also some people have a bad habit
of raising their Kundalini

12:33.251 --> 12:35.461
in the program, suddenly giving bandhans,

12:35.662 --> 12:38.719
giving bandhans to themselves, bandhans
to others. Is nonsense.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.546
Just now I am there. You don’t have to.
Just you desire.

12:42.747 --> 12:46.474
You just try to develop your desire power
and just desire.

12:46.675 --> 12:50.164
You desire something; it will work out.

12:50.920 --> 12:55.486
I mean, I work like that and you should
learn this trick, how to desire.

12:55.687 --> 13:00.292
But desire should be pure desire. Then
Kundalini works it out.

13:00.493 --> 13:04.996
I was in Kolhapur and I was telling him,
our Yogi Mahajan,

13:05.197 --> 13:10.332
I want to buy those chimtas for the,
for the,

13:12.693 --> 13:17.006
we should say all the countries, western
countries and also the leaders.

13:17.207 --> 13:20.266
And just imagine, they said that you can’t
get them in Kolhapur.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.322
And there they are; they have bought it
and brought it.

13:23.523 --> 13:26.661
I mean, it’s a small incident but there are
thousand one things I can tell you.

13:26.862 --> 13:31.487
I have to just desire. I desired that
the Eastern bloc

13:31.688 --> 13:34.662
must be cleared out, must be freed.

13:34.863 --> 13:41.927
So a program of Sahaja Yoga, of what you
call the Yoga seminar, was held in Russia.

13:42.128 --> 13:45.641
And I told My husband and I told everyone,
“I’m going there

13:45.842 --> 13:49.338
to break the Eastern bloc.” I just told.

13:49.539 --> 13:51.851
When I went there they gave Me hardly
any time.

13:52.052 --> 13:54.574
But I broke it because the people who got
realization,

13:54.775 --> 13:59.361
they were from all these countries and they
just went and triggered it.

13:59.562 --> 14:01.978
So I had told beforehand that this is
My purpose

14:02.179 --> 14:06.922
but I am so intensely desiring anything;

14:07.123 --> 14:10.348
in the same way if you have a pure desire
about it,

14:10.549 --> 14:19.283
not from any, any malicious or some sort
of a selfish attitude.

14:19.484 --> 14:24.469
Like my brother, my sister, my... this is
Indians have this greater problem…

14:24.670 --> 14:28.500
my wife, this, that. The wife will support
the husband,

14:28.701 --> 14:31.241
the husband will support the wife,
nonsensical things will go on.

14:31.442 --> 14:35.904
But by this they are really taking them
down.

14:37.320 --> 14:41.233
And you people also should not sort
of have, because somebody

14:41.434 --> 14:45.580
is from, say, Switzerland, Swiss people
will sit together.

14:45.781 --> 14:49.600
It’s a very wrong thing to do. I’ve told
hundred times, nobody from the same….

14:49.801 --> 14:52.936
Now I can see it’s even that the same thing
happening here.

14:53.137 --> 14:56.290
English must sit together. And English have
the worst habit in this,

14:56.491 --> 15:00.618
that they must form a group. That’s their
style, is to have their group.

15:00.819 --> 15:05.565
So this is all is our conditioning. You see,
why I am telling you

15:05.766 --> 15:10.133
that Sahaja Yoga is not going to benefit
by you but you have to be benefited.

15:10.294 --> 15:13.664
So all these little, little conditionings
that you have, you just judge yourself:

15:13.865 --> 15:17.674
“Are we doing like that?”; “Are we
sitting?”; “Am I sitting next to a Swiss?”;

15:17.875 --> 15:21.104
“Am I sitting next to an English?”.
Run away.

15:22.511 --> 15:25.778
And then maybe that you think you can speak
in the same language

15:25.979 --> 15:28.517
or whatever it is. No. Let us sit away.

15:28.718 --> 15:31.819
Then Delhi people will sit together, Bombay
people will sit together

15:31.995 --> 15:35.304
and you ask them, “Do you know this lady?”
“No, who was she?”

15:35.505 --> 15:37.927
“I mean, she was there.” “No, I never
met her.”

15:38.128 --> 15:43.327
Because nobody wants to meet, nobody wants
to talk, nobody wants to know.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.237
And it is to be understood that this is
a place of pilgrimage,

15:47.438 --> 15:51.105
there’s no fashion show on.  And one should
not go about putting

15:51.306 --> 15:55.472
fashionable clothes and fashionable dresses
and... Be humble about it.

15:55.673 --> 15:59.350
This is sometimes I’m really shocked
the way people are dressing up.

15:59.551 --> 16:02.097
It’s all right, for Pujas and all that,
you can come.

16:02.298 --> 16:05.262
But the way people are dressed up sometimes
it’s surprising.

16:05.463 --> 16:08.973
You are coming here, for what? For your
meditation.

16:09.174 --> 16:14.482
So be in a simpler dress, in a simpler
attitude, in a simpler mind.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.944
Today I have to tell you because I’ve been
noticing few things

16:18.145 --> 16:23.398
that you are missing the point. We are
here for our ascent.

16:23.599 --> 16:29.399
We have come all the way. Pilgrimage is
there for your ascent and for nothing else.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.839
We are here only for our ascent, for our
joy,

16:34.040 --> 16:37.637
for opening out ourselves. And that is
what we have to remember.

16:37.838 --> 16:41.127
I’m your Mother. I have to tell you
the truth because it is your benevolence

16:41.328 --> 16:45.002
that I want, that you all should become
great foundations

16:45.203 --> 16:48.594
of Sahaja Yoga which is going to emancipate
the whole world.

16:48.795 --> 16:51.589
Moreover, anybody who is sick need not come
to Me.

16:51.781 --> 16:55.147
You can cure that person with it. You can
yourself cure.

16:55.348 --> 17:02.233
This person who is a realized soul can cure
himself or herself, or you can cure.

17:02.434 --> 17:06.054
What is the need to bring everybody to Me?
This is sick, that is sick,

17:06.255 --> 17:08.553
that is there. No need.

17:08.754 --> 17:11.368
Among yourselves only you can have these
things done,

17:11.569 --> 17:16.173
and I think the doctors and all these people
can also have a little conference together,

17:16.374 --> 17:20.485
and anybody who has problems can come and
tell them what’s the problem is.

17:20.686 --> 17:23.607
And can be done. There’s also no need also
to have doctors.

17:23.808 --> 17:27.299
We have some people here, very simple
people, who can help you a lot.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.917
So among yourselves you should help and you
should learn how to do it:

17:31.118 --> 17:34.300
how to raise the Kundalini; how to tie it
up; how to clear the chakras;

17:34.501 --> 17:38.092
what’s wrong with you. Attention should be
how I am going to achieve it.

17:38.293 --> 17:40.842
But the attention is not so high.

17:41.043 --> 17:45.931
So I would request you today that you
please pay full attention to the program

17:46.132 --> 17:52.536
and enjoy and really try to develop that
sensitivity of enjoyment.

17:52.760 --> 17:57.490
This is just you are clinging onto something
which is not going to take you

17:57.691 --> 18:02.237
to the Ocean of Joy. All right?
May God bless you.
