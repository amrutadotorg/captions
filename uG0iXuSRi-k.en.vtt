00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:42.770
Yesterday
you have seen how Durga used to protect all

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:58.347
the seekers, sadhakas, and how She killed
the people who have been troubling, torturing,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:03.317
killing the seekers of truth.

00:12:03.619 --> 00:12:11.388
Her whole advent was to protect them from
all these evil forces.

00:12:13.238 --> 00:12:19.169
In those days, that was the most important
work.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:30.579
So that's how the sadhakas came up to these
modern times, and now they are seekers of

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:37.110
truth or they have found the truth.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:56.040
All this different passage has taught the
sadhakas what is the use of their life.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:06.469
They were frantically, first, trying to find
the truth, frantically, and they went into

00:13:06.469 --> 00:13:08.490
different difficult places.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:22.930
They thought by going into some lonely places
they'll be able to settle their mind in peace

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.010
and they'll be able to find the truth.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:36.660
Also they sacrificed many things: their wealth,
which was bothering them; their families,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.190
they thought was standing in the way of their
search.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:53.359
All this
went on and there are still some people who

00:13:53.359 --> 00:14:00.910
believe that by becoming an ascetic one can
find the truth.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.089
Buddha did the same.

00:14:04.089 --> 00:14:07.410
Mahavira did the same.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:12.130
Their life was nothing but a great tapasya.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:26.199
Their tapasyas are helping us today in such
a way that we now have got such a blessing

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:37.259
that our personalities, as they are, can receive
Self Realization for which people struggled

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:51.930
and struggled in such a way that if you read
that, how they were suffering, you might be

00:14:51.930 --> 00:15:02.520
really amazed how they went through all this
suffering and all this tapasya, just with

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:10.160
the goal to get their Self Realization.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:18.720
It is an ordeal even to read about them and
to know about them.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:26.100
And while they were seeking, also, there were
so many people who tried to trouble them,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.580
who tried to torture them, who tried to kill.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:40.499
And the people surrounding them didn't know
what they were doing.

00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:45.560
They used to ridicule them, laugh at them,
make fun of them.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:56.700
With all this, what we learn that we have
got our Self Realization very easily, without

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:03.000
any torture, without any ordeal, without any
sufferings, fasting, nothing.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.950
It's not true.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:15.810
Because you are the same people who have done
all this before and that's why you are here.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.450
It's your matter of right to have your Self
Realization.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:26.230
It's no way is to say that “without anything
we got it”.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.570
Because it is life after life you have been
seekers.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:36.910
Whatever path you followed, whatever religion
you followed, whatever faiths you followed,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.350
it was a torture for you.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:46.880
And this torture is today now fulfilled, that
today you are self-realized people.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:55.800
But in any way we see that human beings, if
they get something rather easily they don't

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.940
understand the value of how they got it.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:12.680
Now to get this easily, actually you must
know, is not just because you were nothing.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.780
You were something great.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:24.790
You were great saints went into Himalayas,
you did all kinds of ordeals and fasting and

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:32.220
where so many of you were killed and butchered
in the name of God.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:41.660
So today, whatever you have got, whatever
Realization you have got, is not just something

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:48.560
you should think that "It's only Mother's
grace that we have got it."

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:57.760
It's your own great personality which has
achieved it.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.650
Otherwise, it would have been impossible for
Me to give you Realization.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:10.870
Whatever the work the deities have done, they
have brought you to this level of human existence,

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.710
protecting you.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:23.680
But now, naturally, just this is the last
step which you have crossed and you have achieved

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:35.440
this Self Realization and so many of you have
achieved great heights.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:44.360
This power within us, the Kundalini, which
has connected you to this all-pervading

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:59.530
Power, has been struggling, has been guiding
you, has been all the time looking after you,

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:06.160
protecting you so that you should achieve
your goal in this Kali Yuga.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.090
It was said that only during Kali Yuga this
will happen and those people who are seeking

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:21.810
God in the mountains and in the valleys will
find it, but they'll be normal people, people

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:31.210
who will have household and living like normal
people in the society.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:39.020
They won't be some sort of sadhus or saints,
but people who are married, who have children,

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:44.710
all such people who are leading a very normal
life will receive their Realization.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:50.230
It’s already said, it’s already predicted
by Bhrugu Muni.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.199
So it's all been already said, I think all
been planned.

00:19:55.199 --> 00:20:02.540
But in this a credit goes, of course, to you
people, that you have recognized what is the

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.540
truth.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.319
As you know, there are so many false people
going about.

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:15.520
They are doing all kinds of tricks, they are
trying all kinds of methods to entice people.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.660
Despite that, you have recognized Me.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.789
This recognition is something very remarkable.

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:31.580
And I am Myself surprised how, like lost children
finding their mother, come back to her, in

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.950
the same way all of you are here.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:42.870
But in this we should not think that we have
got it easily, or we have got it without any

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:50.780
difficulties, because this can create a little
problem that we will not go further with the

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.989
same speed, with the same dedication as we
have been doing before.

00:20:56.989 --> 00:21:00.929
So whatever you think is easy, was not easy
at all.

00:21:00.929 --> 00:21:01.939
It is sahaja.

00:21:01.939 --> 00:21:05.299
It is, one can say, spontaneous.

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:13.700
But, now it is for you really to understand
that this time is so important, we have to

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:20.489
save the whole world, that you have to project
yourself, as I said last time, and to find

00:21:20.489 --> 00:21:26.069
out ways and methods how you can do these
things.

00:21:26.069 --> 00:21:32.489
In Russia, I must tell you, I had a very good
experience of a very highly developed soul

00:21:32.489 --> 00:21:34.379
who is a very well known scientist.

00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:41.200
He’s one of the biggest scientists of Russia,
and he’s indulging also into spirituality.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.499
He told people that “I’m indulging into
spirituality, I would like to see Mother.”

00:21:46.499 --> 00:21:49.729
I said, “All right, I would love to see
him.”

00:21:49.729 --> 00:21:58.610
So when he came, he looked at Me and he said,
“I know Mother, that You are the incarnation

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.309
of God in these modern times.”

00:22:02.309 --> 00:22:05.809
I was quite surprised for a scientist to say
that.

00:22:05.809 --> 00:22:13.390
But his eyes, so pure and so full of devotion
and humility.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:19.970
Then he says that “I want to do something
if You help me.”

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.640
I said, “What do you want to do?”

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.379
He said, “I cannot measure Your power, I
cannot.”

00:22:28.379 --> 00:22:31.739
He had an instrument by which he could measure
the power.

00:22:31.739 --> 00:22:36.140
“I can’t also measure the power of Your
photographs.”

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.860
He said, he told Me a number which I couldn’t
understand, was something – seven hundred

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.590
raised to power, some sort of a billion into
billiardi, like that.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.950
I said, “Now what’s this number is?

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.960
I don’t know.”

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.900
So he told Me that “This is what Your photograph
is.”

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.970
So I said, “All right, now what do you want
Me to do?”

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.770
I told him, “You can take this photograph
if you think it is so powerful.”

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.830
So he took the photograph with such respect
and this thing.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.920
At least four, five times he bowed to Me.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.369
I said, “What do you want to do about it?”

00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:11.600
He said that “I want to put it on a satellite.”

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.890
Now see the projection part – satellite.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.939
“Then what will you do?”

00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:25.159
“And I’m going to put electromagnetic
force behind it so this will, the power that

00:23:25.159 --> 00:23:29.950
is in this one, will penetrate into things.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:35.319
Because electromagnet can penetrate, with
that these vibrations will also penetrate.

00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:44.129
So I will go onto the satellite and from there
I’ll project this and I’ll see the global

00:23:44.129 --> 00:23:50.030
problems.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.599
Then wherever I’ll project this the problems
will be solved.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:59.619
I’ll try to first of all make the land fertile
with this.”

00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:02.559
One photograph of Mine, can you imagine?

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:03.999
See his projection.

00:24:03.999 --> 00:24:05.309
I was amazed, you see.

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:07.580
I said, “Look at this man.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.400
What he has been thinking all the time.”

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.069
He said, “This is not difficult, it’s
not difficult.”

00:24:14.069 --> 00:24:15.069
I said, “How?”

00:24:15.069 --> 00:24:19.189
So he showed Me with a spring, you know, something
was like a spring.

00:24:19.189 --> 00:24:26.010
He put it on water which I had vibrated and
the spring started jumping.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:30.989
And then he showed with his machine that the
whole thing was moving so fast, you see.

00:24:30.989 --> 00:24:35.239
“Mother, just see the water that You have
vibrated, how great it is.”

00:24:35.239 --> 00:24:41.919
I said, “This is, I’ve never heard that
you can transform this power into something

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:44.619
which will work out on material thing.”

00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:48.059
He said, “This power can work out in anything.

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:52.420
It is this power which has created everything,
so it will work out in everything.”

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:58.819
I was so surprised, and he said, “I’ve
been just waiting to meet You and this I’m

00:24:58.819 --> 00:24:59.819
going to start.

00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:02.650
I’ve got a lot of work to be done.”

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:07.210
And he told his friend, “Now let’s go,
we have lot of work to be done.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.360
I want to do all this in the lifetime of Mother.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.129
She should see what we have to do.”

00:25:13.129 --> 00:25:22.099
I was amazed from where this fellow has dropped
on this earth.

00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:31.970
Such an experience of a scientist.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.569
In the West, no scientist will even look at
Me.

00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:42.049
Nobody will think that they can do something
about these vibrations.

00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:49.070
But you see, he has already developed a method
by which he can measure the vibrations, you

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.070
see.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.679
I don’t know, I didn’t ask him any further
questions because I thought he’s too much

00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:57.640
in it and let him do what he likes.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:12.700
And you see, I find that in Russia, people
are very highly placed and they have many

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:18.150
ideas, but spirituality is the main thing,
and morality.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:23.780
There was another gentleman I would say he
was hardly about thirty, thirty-two years

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.520
of age, very much sparkling.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:32.280
He came, I asked him, “What do you want
Me to do?”

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:38.010
He said, “No, You have done too much for
us, now we’ll do for You.”

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.979
“So what do you want to do?”

00:26:39.979 --> 00:26:42.659
He said, “I’m in charge here of spirituality.”

00:26:42.659 --> 00:26:44.510
Can you imagine?

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:50.749
We have no such government where there is
a subject like spirituality that somebody

00:26:50.749 --> 00:26:52.679
is in charge of spirituality.

00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:53.679
This is Russia.

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:57.090
I said, “You are in charge of spirituality?”

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:05.450
“Yes, and I have to deal with students from
very young age to the college.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:12.840
And can You tell me, Mother, at what age the
children are more receptive of spirituality?”

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:19.580
I said “There is no hard and fast rule about
it.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:27.340
But as children, very small children because
they are so innocent, it works out.”

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:33.499
So he asked Me, “How do we put spirituality
into them?”

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:38.809
I said “You can raise their Kundalini, you
can tie them up and they will become really

00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:43.719
people with such an attention that you will
be amazed at that.”

00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:49.069
He said “I’m gathering all the people
of all the faiths and I’m going to tell

00:27:49.069 --> 00:27:53.129
them that it’s only Sahaja Yoga which is
the right path.”

00:27:53.129 --> 00:27:55.619
Can you imagine?

00:27:55.619 --> 00:28:01.499
Such a wonderful person, hardly thirty-two
years of age, I mean one better than the other,

00:28:01.499 --> 00:28:02.580
I thought.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.080
One really better than the other.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.660
Then he asked Me the schemes, “What should
we do for patriotism, what should we do for

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.700
this...”

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:21.739
He was so much alert and he said, “Through
spirituality, how can we improve their lives?

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.969
Of the students?”

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:32.749
Now he’s in charge of all the students of
Russia and he is also a member of the parliament.

00:28:32.749 --> 00:28:39.569
He said, “There are other eight, nine members
who are also in the same committee and they

00:28:39.569 --> 00:28:46.290
want spirituality to grow.”

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.290
I was amazed.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.400
I mean what a country is this Russia?

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.770
How could they have such people?

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.210
Then the third one came.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.630
He was also member of parliament, very dynamic.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:05.040
First he was right hand man of Yeltsin but
then he gave him up.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.270
He said, “He’s not moral.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.090
I don’t want to have anything to do with
a person who’s not moral.”

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.150
“So now what are you doing?”

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:19.230
He said, “Now we are thinking of getting
elected by some, another party.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.079
Name is My Motherland.”

00:29:21.079 --> 00:29:23.380
I said, “Very good idea.”

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:29.880
“So in that we’ll not have fixed ideas
like it is a democracy or a, you can call

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.500
it, communism or this.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.050
But whatever suits my motherland, that we’ll
have.”

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:43.530
It’s a very practical, is a most practical
thing that whatever will be good for my motherland,

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.060
that we will have.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.079
Nothing else.

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:49.349
I said, “Really this is very practical.”

00:29:49.349 --> 00:29:54.380
And he may one day replace this Yeltsin and
all that.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.130
Very dynamic, very nice.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:03.670
Just now he was little bit depressed, because
he said, “They are stupid people over here,”

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.599
and this and that.

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:09.890
But then he got very hopeful, I said, “We’ll
help you all out” and that.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.360
But such a truthful man.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:19.050
And he said, “The basis of human life is
morality.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:23.370
If you have no morality, then all the rest
is nonsense.”

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:29.990
He studied in England and he said also in
America for quite some time, and the other

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.990
fellow had studied.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:36.920
And they said in America they got fed up absolutely
and, “We don’t want to go back there.”

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:44.339
So the wisdom of these people really was very
striking to Me.

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:52.199
Now the another, third thing, which I discovered
is even much more deeper than this.

00:30:52.199 --> 00:31:02.550
When I went to Ukraine, I saw some very nice
paintings done with a very aboriginal sort

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.630
of colors.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:09.360
So they said, “Mother, this we had before
the Christians came in.”

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:18.160
They showed Me a magazine in which there was
a photograph of the Primordial Mother and

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.699
they called it Aditi, that’s Sanskrit.

00:31:19.699 --> 00:31:21.699
We too also call it Aditi.

00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:23.170
Can you imagine?

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:29.680
Then they said, “This culture existed before
the Christian aggression came in.”

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:39.719
And there was paintings of Mooladhara Chakra
in different ways and also of Agnya Chakra.

00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:45.430
And the way they were talking about all this,
even in the magazine, I was really surprised.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:57.839
They said that “All this was published,
we have books on this, but because of the

00:31:57.839 --> 00:32:03.870
church it was all said, “It’s all nonsense,
there’s nothing like Aditi.”

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:19.420
But the best part I saw was the picture of
the Aditi and there was a Kundalini in Her

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.420
stomach.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.800
Or stomach or lopa.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.870
And was shown going upward like that.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.280
I said, “Look at this culture these people
had.”

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:36.469
Then they said, “We had relations with India,
and they were Aryans and we were also Aryans

00:32:36.469 --> 00:32:38.980
and we used to meet them.”

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:44.630
So I thought, Macchindranath and all these
people had gone to the north of India, they

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:51.069
might have come to this Ukraine, and they
said that, I mean the whole thing was traced

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:57.590
to - Ukraine name came from Kuru and all kinds
of things were traced in Sanskrit.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.030
All this I was amazed.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.349
What a culture they had!

00:33:02.349 --> 00:33:04.309
In what culture they lived!

00:33:04.309 --> 00:33:07.280
It’s something, you know, unbelievable.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.900
While in India there are many people who don’t
know what is Kundalini.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.570
If you tell them Kundalini, they think Kundalini
means horoscope.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.599
Especially in the North they have no idea
of Kundalini.

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:26.240
But here are the people who have really, have
lived in a culture for thousands of years,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.610
and they said this was before Christ three
thousand years.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.610
Can you imagine?

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:32.740
Before Christ, three thousand.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:39.820
And, so we too had civilizations in India,
like Harapa and all that of that time.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:44.969
But they said India is the source of spirituality.

00:33:44.969 --> 00:33:49.590
That magazine, I was amazed at it and the
way it was done.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:54.910
And the Mooladhara and the Agnya Chakra and
all that done so well.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.939
Maybe they might have seen it.

00:33:56.939 --> 00:34:03.559
They might not have got Realization but they
talked about Realization and also about achieving

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:05.750
Self-hood.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.890
This was so many years back.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:13.199
But then they said, “The Christian religion
came and they told us, ‘It’s all nonsense,

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.620
have nothing to do with it.’”

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:21.709
As they told Me also in Greece that they had
Athena and Primordial Mother and all that.

00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:23.480
But they said, “No Mother, nothing.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.679
Better stop it.”

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:28.089
So it was all cancelled and nobody looked
at it.

00:34:28.089 --> 00:34:35.560
But can you imagine that so many years back
it existed in that Ukraine?

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.300
Such a beautiful culture of spirituality.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.980
First time I went to Ukraine we had people
there.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:51.880
There was a Chernobyl, you know that, was
a big explosion and they were all - like somebody

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.839
had these fingers cut out or you can say,
attached to each other.

00:34:56.839 --> 00:34:58.880
Somebody had boils all over the body.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.540
Somebody’s nose was turned like that and
horrible looking like lepers they were, all

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.670
of them, those who came to the program.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:12.790
But then this time, more than this were the
people there in Ukraine, I must tell you,

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.469
much more than that.

00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:21.250
The whole hall was full, the three tier was
full, the passages were full and still the

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.969
people outside were standing.

00:35:24.969 --> 00:35:30.459
And they said, “We were the ones who suffered
from this and now look at us we are completely

00:35:30.459 --> 00:35:31.459
cured.”

00:35:31.459 --> 00:35:33.790
You won’t believe, I never touched anyone.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:41.849
I was there only once, they came to My program
and they got cured.

00:35:41.849 --> 00:35:43.870
So this sensitivity that they had.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:51.490
I used to wonder why these Russians and Ukrainians
are so sensitive to spirituality.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:58.599
Then I realized that these people who have
got spirituality is ancient.

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:01.880
From ancient times they were practising this.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.709
And we had Macchindranath, Gorakhnath - all
these people.

00:36:05.709 --> 00:36:11.920
But nobody practiced Kundalini awakening to
this extent that it was in every village they

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:20.270
used to make the paintings about Mooladhara,
about this another Agnya Chakra very clearly.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:28.309
And in the Agnya Chakra was Ing and Ang of
the Chinese, can you imagine?

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:33.969
After discovering that, I really felt that
in the world there must be lots of people

00:36:33.969 --> 00:36:34.969
like that.

00:36:34.969 --> 00:36:41.550
Now in Colombia I have seen also, they have
the same Kundalini and a Kumba and everything.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.750
I think that’s even more than that.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.700
Three, four thousand years back before Christ.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:37:00.640
So what we find, that we had all this knowledge
in all these countries and is still, that

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.699
knowledge is still, working in the minds of
the people.

00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:18.530
They are very introspective and also they
know a lot about the sun.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:26.209
It is this kind of sensitivity comes only
when, basically in the roots of that country

00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:30.349
you have exposure to spirituality.

00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:38.340
It’s a kind of a miraculous revelation one
could see there.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:46.510
How they knew everything about Kundalini,
about the Primordial Mother, about this happening,

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:53.540
about spirituality and what happens to a person
when he becomes a realized soul.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:38:01.860
The speciality I saw about them, they’re
extremely humble people.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.750
To them I am really, I don’t know, how they
bow to Me and it’s, sometimes I just can’t

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:14.000
imagine how these people have such sense of
spirituality and such peace.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.209
When they had this coup, I asked them, “Aren’t
you worried?

00:38:20.209 --> 00:38:23.370
This coup is here and I don’t know what
will happen to your country.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.380
Aren’t you worried?”

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.750
They said, “Mother why should we worry?

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.939
After all we are in the Kingdom of God.

00:38:29.939 --> 00:38:35.349
We are not living in Russia, we are living
in the Kingdom of God.

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:39.459
So why should we worry?”

00:38:39.459 --> 00:38:45.140
And meeting such nice people there, such sensitive
people to spirituality.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:51.059
They have thrown away practically all the
false gurus, all the false gurus.

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:54.480
And for Me they showed such respect and such
care.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.569
They had this conference only for Me.

00:38:57.569 --> 00:39:04.200
So now why I’m telling you all this, that
now you all have got Realization.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:15.469
You have now felt your Spirit and you have
entered into the Kingdom of God, no doubt.

00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:25.429
But now you must understand that this power
that you have, what it does to you.

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:30.849
What it creates in you.

00:39:30.849 --> 00:39:41.579
The most important thing is by this power
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:45.370
That is you come in the present.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:54.250
To achieve the present is an impossible task.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:40:01.160
So you, once you are in thoughtless awareness
what happens that no thoughts bombard your

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.160
mind.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.640
Wherever you may be, you may be in America,
you may be in any place.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.839
You are not bombarded by thoughts.

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:14.099
So, what does that mean?

00:40:14.099 --> 00:40:22.330
Into very simple language we can say, it means
that you do not reflect.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.240
You do not have a reflecting mind.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:35.750
Now this is the basic problem of Sahaja Yogis
of today, which one should try to conquer.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.110
That you do not reflect.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:43.719
That’s the only way you can achieve your
steadiness.

00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:53.329
For example I have seen people, for nothing
at all they’ll just start laughing, nothing

00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:54.870
at all.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:41:03.079
They see somebody, immediately they react
– “This was nice but not so good.”

00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:07.679
They start giving their opinions, especially
in the West, about everything.

00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:16.920
Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable and
start telling what is best and what is not

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.319
the best, what is not good.

00:41:19.319 --> 00:41:27.660
And once they start saying something like
that, mind becomes reflective.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.679
If the mind is not reflective, then you are
thoughtless awareness.

00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:34.770
Watch anything, just you watch.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:36.260
Just witness.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.260
You should not reflect.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:45.070
If you are using your mental power, then this
power subsides.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:52.370
This is a very common defect with people because,
I think, you people are more intelligent,

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.370
you think.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.760
Maybe, I think, you are well educated, might
be.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.829
I don’t know, whatever you think.

00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:04.380
But this reflecting mind is a very dangerous
thing for spirituality.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.559
You’ll never grow.

00:42:06.559 --> 00:42:13.610
And then with the reflecting mind, you have
different emotions with something you reflect

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.390
on somebody.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:22.120
Now if it’s your son or daughter or something,
you get identified.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.020
Identification with some is artificial.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.219
It’s not in reality.

00:42:28.219 --> 00:42:32.969
But because this mind reflects, it identifies.

00:42:32.969 --> 00:42:35.559
Now many identifications you have dropped
out.

00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:43.520
For example your bias about religion, about
races, about maybe nationalities, you have

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.849
dropped out.

00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:52.219
But still I would say, the reflecting mind
still acts and this is the greatest hurdle

00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:54.610
for the progress of Sahaja Yogis of today.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:43:04.329
I’ve been thinking, “Why is it the reflecting
mind is so active in Sahaja Yogis of today?”

00:43:04.329 --> 00:43:15.309
If you could stop reflecting, immediately
you establish yourself in the ocean of peace.

00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:19.199
You watch something, just watch.

00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:23.780
There’s no ripple of thought in your mind.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.190
Then you become extremely creative.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.459
You become extremely dynamic, you become extremely
compassionate.

00:43:31.459 --> 00:43:33.449
You have no fear.

00:43:33.449 --> 00:43:38.849
Some people think, “If you are compassionate
you see this man might lynch me”.

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:40.920
You have no fear.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:49.449
All virtues that you have to enjoy you can
only enjoy when you do not reflect.

00:43:49.449 --> 00:43:54.250
That means that you leave everything to the
Divine.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.530
You are not in charge.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:02.929
You don’t see that you have to be reflecting
on something.

00:44:02.929 --> 00:44:12.169
This is the greatest power you have got, is
not to reflect, not to look at somebody with

00:44:12.169 --> 00:44:13.679
that kind of thing.

00:44:13.679 --> 00:44:16.280
I have seen this is still there lingering.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.459
Perhaps I never told you about it, maybe one
of the reasons.

00:44:19.459 --> 00:44:28.020
I don’t say that it’s only your fault
but maybe Mine, because I couldn’t find

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:37.919
what was exactly wrong, that is the reflection
that you have about others.

00:44:37.919 --> 00:44:41.559
Now I told you, have introspection.

00:44:41.559 --> 00:44:50.990
For introspection also it can be reflection,
but that at least gives you idea as to where

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.990
you are.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:56.669
But with that psychologically you can become
extremely depressed.

00:44:56.669 --> 00:45:00.110
You can condemn yourself.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:08.459
Then you may not understand yourself as a
personality that you are and you’ll go on,

00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:14.049
sort of, losing your vibrations, losing your
power.

00:45:14.049 --> 00:45:18.510
Because you are not control of yourself.

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:26.719
So introspection, also, if it brings about
depression and demeaning of your personality,

00:45:26.719 --> 00:45:29.340
best is not to introspect also.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:34.640
Because all these mental activities, I have
seen, create problems.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:44.510
But in a state where you are thoughtlessly
aware, introspection comes to you automatically.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.590
You see it automatically.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.909
You understand it automatically.

00:45:48.909 --> 00:45:56.130
You do not think about it, it just comes to
you.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:02.730
The whole picture comes to you and you are
at peace with yourself.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:06.830
You are never in turmoil, never in trouble.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.389
Then you don’t get angry.

00:46:09.389 --> 00:46:18.590
Then you do not argue, then you do not discuss,
but you become as if dropped in to the ocean

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:27.060
of awareness and you don’t have to worry
as to solve something.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:35.460
When you are reflecting, then you find that
this power works.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:42.220
Now it becomes very contradictory to say that
you have to project and you don’t have to

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.330
reflect.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.609
Now when we reflect we absorb.

00:46:47.609 --> 00:46:53.340
When we reflect on something, we absorb that
thing.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.050
And mostly our attention goes to the defects
of others, “This person is no good, that

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:02.930
is not good, this is, her hair is not all
right, the sari’s not all right.”

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:06.550
This, that and all nonsense.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:11.480
So what are we doing, we are absorbing all
the bad things also.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:17.230
Now when you start admiration of something.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:25.369
Then what happens that you may not get the
good things but at least you are on a better

00:47:25.369 --> 00:47:26.369
line.

00:47:26.369 --> 00:47:32.170
But still, the admiration in thoughtless awareness
is really very deep.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:37.440
I saw this in the eyes of this great scientist.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:47.180
Absolutely he was just one with Me, and his
eyes were like an ocean of peace.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:56.270
He was just looking at Me, and for quite some
time and then he came to his thoughts and

00:47:56.270 --> 00:48:00.770
he told Me that “This is what we can do
with Your photograph.”

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:06.560
So the depth in you will only come when you
do not reflect.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.190
But it’s very common with human beings,
specially in the West, “this carpet is no

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:20.409
good, that is no good, this smell is coming,
that is there,” always trying to judge others,

00:48:20.409 --> 00:48:21.550
judge other things.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.110
This is important?

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:24.670
What is so important?

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:31.109
If you are sitting in the garden of heavens
what does it matter where you are sitting,

00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:35.560
what you are doing?

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:42.540
This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves
of thoughts in our mind.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.860
I have already, once, described it by drawing.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:54.760
How the energy that falls on the right side
goes to the left side and the falls on the

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.849
left goes to the right.

00:48:56.849 --> 00:49:03.630
Crosses over because of two types of cells
we have.

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:10.860
Then out of this energy that goes to the right,
the energy that goes to the left it is sucked

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.260
in partly into the sympathetic.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:20.480
Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.659
That is the way it goes on reflecting.

00:49:23.659 --> 00:49:30.609
Now if you can suck in all that energy and
put it on our sympathetic, then all our energies

00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:32.690
will be thousand fold much more.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:42.530
We’ll not be tired, we’ll not be unhappy,
we’ll be able to stand lots of nonsense.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:46.890
But we’ll not call it a nonsense, we’ll
not think it’s a bad thing, so it has no

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:50.460
effect on us.

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.530
This quality we have to develop.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:50:00.139
I would say with this, today’s special celebration
of Navaratri.

00:50:00.139 --> 00:50:08.350
Like yesterday you saw the Durga’s nine
forms also.

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.000
In that is one is Kushmanda.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.450
As this was told that you absorb all the filth
within yourself, in your stomach.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:21.240
But Devi does that, not you.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.310
What a Devi can do, you should not do.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:30.740
That’s Her job, that She’s supposed to
do these things, not you.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:40.379
What you have to do is to only be in silence
so that you absorb whatever will increase

00:50:40.379 --> 00:50:44.220
that silence, will increase your depth.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.159
Devi will look after all the other, rest of
the things.

00:50:48.159 --> 00:50:56.109
She will look after the, all the filth, all
the anger, all the temper, all the everything

00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:58.290
that’s going on in this world.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:06.470
She will absorb all that, but what you have
to do is to just enjoy everything that is

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:07.530
pure.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:11.450
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond
your mind.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.109
With your mind you can never enjoy.

00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:16.680
It’s like a big load.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.040
It will not act, it will not help.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:27.950
Enjoyment comes when you are in complete silence,
in a rippleless lake.

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:34.730
The reflection of all the joy that is created
on the shores of that lake are completely

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.280
reflected, they are not deflected.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.450
If there were ripples it would have been a
different image altogether and would have

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:49.320
been something nowhere near the image of reality.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:57.770
So one must have a mind which is kept lower
than reality.

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:04.540
In the reality actually it is nothing but
peace and joy.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:12.280
Now a mother’s desire is always that children
should have nothing but peace and joy, no

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:17.570
sufferings, no starvation, no ordeals, nothing.

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:20.910
They must just enjoy.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.960
Now those days are gone.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:35.119
But even to enjoy this, even to live in that
complete peaceful state you have to be non-reflecting.

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:49.000
Now you watch yourself, you’ll be amazed
how much reflecting you are.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.250
When Devi is doing all the job for you.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:59.950
When Paramchaitanya, I don’t know how many
things It is doing, is trying to fill up the

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:03.649
whole atmosphere with It’s activity.

00:53:03.649 --> 00:53:09.120
What is your activity, should be to stop your
mental activity.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:14.290
You’ll be amazed in that state only, you
will grow.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:19.590
With that growth only you will become like
this scientist.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:28.210
How the contradiction now is that when you
have your depth you can project your depth,

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.050
not your mind.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:34.830
Sometimes when I say “project,” people
think it is a projection of the mind.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:41.070
No. you have to project that depth, that reality
that is within you.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:46.770
For that you don’t have to think, you don’t
have to plan, it will just work.

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:50.240
But you’ll be the instrument for that projection.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.230
It is nothing subtle.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.500
It is very simple to understand.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.680
Like I’m talking on this instrument, all
right?

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:11.680
Now if this instrument is absolutely all right,
there’s no problem in it, it will be peaceful.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:21.760
But if this is full of ideas and thoughts
like our brain is, whatever I’m saying will

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.510
not be the same that will be broadcasted.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:33.960
In the same way, when our mind is full of
turmoil and arguments and what you can say,

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:42.599
comments, or we can also say the reflection,
then what happens is that this mind gets into

00:54:42.599 --> 00:55:01.080
like a whirlpool of disturbances and it cannot
project itself fully because it is disturbed.

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.070
It is not a normal thing.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:07.480
So now you’ll understand there is no contradiction.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:13.159
You can only project yourself when you are
absolutely peaceful.

00:55:13.159 --> 00:55:16.140
And this is what we have to learn.

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:25.990
This is Navaratri’s great days are here
and that you should know that it starts, actually,

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:33.850
in the western world from the 21st, in the
equinox, after the equinox, in September.

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:41.620
There are two Navaratri’s we have, you see,
one starts now and one starts after the second

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.620
equinox.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:50.430
Now in this equinox, Mother Mary’s birthday
is there, equinox.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.670
And that’s why people celebrate Her birthday.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:57.599
They don’t know why She was born on equinox.

00:55:57.599 --> 00:56:00.430
For the balance.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:09.560
Then, you see, because nothing was explained
about the lives of these great incarnations,

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.530
people use them the way they like.

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:19.369
Because they have seen miracles with them,
so they do not try to understand why this

00:56:19.369 --> 00:56:25.530
equinox is there and why this is celebrated.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:32.200
Now I was told in Iran, this is the time they
have the new year.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:39.400
That means the Muslims observe this as a new
year, so when Navaratri starts is the new

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.400
year.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:48.349
That means it’s the twelfth month for them
and so many things are suggestive of that,

00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:50.330
that why should it be twelve months.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:53.190
Why should the Goddess be born at twelve o’clock.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:58.700
All this has a special meaning and which you
can find out.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:04.119
But only possible when you are not reflecting.

00:57:04.119 --> 00:57:10.720
This is what is the state in which you are
really in connection with the all-pervading

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.820
Power.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:17.879
Otherwise you are not there, you are not one
with that state.

00:57:17.879 --> 00:57:23.610
To be one with that state you have to be absolutely
silent within yourself.

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:28.159
For the Goddess, She is silent.

00:57:28.159 --> 00:57:33.839
There’s a fight on, She’s silent, because
She’s so confident.

00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:35.940
She knows about Her powers.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:43.720
She knows Maheshasura or any asura cannot
trouble Her, cannot touch Her.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:48.480
She knows what are their powers are and She
knows all Her powers.

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.800
So She doesn’t have to be disturbed by anything.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:59.599
She’s not disturbed because She’s really
the personification of this peace state, where

00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:02.270
She’s so powerful.

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:05.399
She doesn’t have to know about Her powers.

00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:12.290
She doesn’t have to ask the powers to exert,
they just work, automatically.

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:20.030
This is the state in which, you will be amazed,
so many things happen, unknowingly, without

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:23.180
your doing anything.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:28.670
And that is what we call as coincidences,
but actually it is not coincidence.

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:40.780
It is the state in which we are in a thoughtless
awareness, and then the Paramachaitanya is

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.990
related to us.

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.990
Absolutely related.

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.030
We are there.

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:48.370
And that works out everything for us.

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:54.950
So in Sahaja Yoga, this time, as you know
about the Goddess, what She has done, so much

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.900
work for years together.

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:05.490
Now you all have become realized souls and
you must understand that complete confidence

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:14.250
in yourself, complete understanding about
yourself, never to have any fear, never to

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:20.200
have any thoughts which can bombard your mind.

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.560
At that state you are the most powerful person.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:33.470
I hope, for this Navaratri, you will realize
what work the Goddess has done for you, how

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:41.980
much She's worked hard, how much She's fought,
She’s been fighting with these horrible

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:44.991
devils and rakshasas.

00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:56.109
And, sometimes I feel now, these devils are
within us, they're not outside, and that comes

00:59:56.109 --> 01:00:02.579
to us because we reflect too much on things.

01:00:02.579 --> 01:00:08.710
If you talk to any one of the western people
you're amazed, as if all the media they have

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.120
on their heads.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.889
They know about each and every person, what
he did, what was this, what was that.

01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:19.760
But he's not worried.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:27.339
He doesn't think how he can improve it, how
you can work it out.

01:00:27.339 --> 01:00:36.290
At this state of thoughtless awareness you
encompass the whole universe, and at that

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:42.270
state, this power works wherever the problem
may be.

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:50.900
So we have to understand our value, that we
have this power within ourself, and this is

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:57.210
to be respected and to give credit to the
Goddess because She's done so much work for

01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:05.250
us that She should not feel that it's now
they got Realization just for a song and they

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:09.899
are not bothered, they don't know how to develop
it.

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:21.510
She will not be in any way hurt but Her work,
what She has done, we have to see, we have

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:31.980
to understand and we have to have a feeling
that somehow, as we now have got enlightenment,

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:39.750
we should try to be people as complete instruments
of that power.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:46.470
That's only possible when you don't have your
own ideas, your own interference.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:55.359
Complete instrument, just like as I said,
this instrument has to be perfectly all right,

01:01:55.359 --> 01:01:57.460
otherwise it cannot work.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.889
Thank you very much.

01:01:59.889 --> 01:02:02.170
May God bless you!
