00:01.819 --> 00:07.809
This has been the month of warnings somehow,
because certain things I’ve been seeing

00:07.809 --> 00:24.609
in people how it happens and, how people get
into problems, how our inner being is disturbed,

00:24.609 --> 00:36.739
and why sometimes Sahaja Yoga fails within
you. One must understand the dangers we face

00:36.739 --> 00:42.370
as human beings.
No doubt you are the highest of this creation,

00:42.370 --> 00:51.020
no doubt. For you this Universe was created,
for you this Earth was created, no doubt.

00:51.020 --> 01:02.940
And today you are at a situation where you
have to get out of this illusion. The time

01:02.940 --> 01:12.770
has come, everything is right. But on a tree
if you notice the most delicate stage is that

01:12.770 --> 01:22.110
of a flower. Flower is the most delicate thing.
The roots are tough, extremely tough: they

01:22.110 --> 01:30.090
penetrate through the land, hardest possible
land; they go through different rocks and

01:30.090 --> 01:36.060
find their ways. But when it comes to the
flower stage, it’s a very, very, delicate

01:36.060 --> 01:46.899
stage: though the whole creation just waits
for that time. The whole tree works it out,

01:46.899 --> 01:54.329
and the tree creates that beautiful flower.
It’s waiting for that time, that blossom

01:54.329 --> 02:00.520
time, when the flowers have to become the
fruit. Now that is the time, that precarious

02:00.520 --> 02:11.970
time, that beautiful time, that fantastic,
dynamic time is. But we do not know how delicate

02:11.970 --> 02:22.260
it is, and that’s how, we really play too
much with ourselves.

02:22.260 --> 02:32.800
Before realisation, you have seen people who
have come to Me who had terrible mental problems;

02:32.800 --> 02:41.190
who were mentally deranged people absolutely,
epileptic and of serious type. They got cured,

02:41.190 --> 02:50.110
they got their realisation, they settled back.
You have seen people with cancer, with blood

02:50.110 --> 02:55.510
cancer, all kinds of physical troubles: they
got their blessings, they got their realisation,

02:55.510 --> 03:02.780
they have settled back. You have seen people
from very false gurus who have damaged their

03:02.780 --> 03:07.820
being completely, who have been mesmerised,
who have been absolutely misled and lynched

03:07.820 --> 03:15.950
and have been made into you can say just cabbages.
Such people also came to Sahaja Yoga and tried

03:15.950 --> 03:20.420
and prospered.
But again it’s the flower stage one must

03:20.420 --> 03:31.540
not forget, and that is the time one has to
be very careful. At the blossom time only,

03:31.540 --> 03:39.740
imagine, the times are so precarious that
the gardener has to worry that there should

03:39.740 --> 03:50.420
not be a hailstorm! And all the satanic forces
have worked up in their fullest form, with

03:50.420 --> 04:01.590
their greatest strength, with all their tricks
and methods, to curb down the progress of

04:01.590 --> 04:14.260
this creation into its fruitful happening.
At such [a] precarious time one has to be

04:14.260 --> 04:23.450
very aware of all the dangers that we can
face.

04:23.450 --> 04:31.040
The greatest danger comes to people when,
after getting realisation also, they do not

04:31.040 --> 04:36.990
have faith in Sahaja Yoga. It’s the greatest
danger, because that’s your anchorage, that’s

04:36.990 --> 04:46.670
the way you are saved. Say if there’s a
boat, which comes for your rescue, and you

04:46.670 --> 04:52.130
are drowning and it rescues you, you see it,
you can feel it. Those who have not felt,

04:52.130 --> 04:57.690
alright, but those who have felt it, you come
off the boat and then you do not believe in

04:57.690 --> 05:04.540
the boat, you do not have faith in boat, that’s
the greatest danger you face.

05:04.540 --> 05:14.550
People have faith in all kinds of nonsense
very easily, but to believe that you have

05:14.550 --> 05:23.450
found the Reality, to believe that you can
be saved, is very difficult for people who

05:23.450 --> 05:29.920
are all the time drowned and are threatened
and frightened. Because the habit is formed

05:29.920 --> 05:45.030
to be always drowned, harassed, haunted, by
fears. So that habit doesn’t go and that

05:45.030 --> 05:51.420
comes over and you feel frightened and you
lose faith in Sahaja Yoga. Whether you have

05:51.420 --> 05:56.590
faith in it or not, it works. It works on
people who do not even have faith.

05:56.590 --> 06:02.220
Today only I received a very interesting letter
from India and a man who is suppose to be

06:02.220 --> 06:11.910
something big there. He told Me he read an
advertisement about Me, that Mataji is going

06:11.910 --> 06:17.520
to give realisation through Kundalini awakening,
and he just came just to make fun of the whole

06:17.520 --> 06:23.990
thing, to the program. And there he felt that
I was just befooling people, it is not possible,

06:23.990 --> 06:34.220
he sat with a very skeptical ideas. But his
Kundalini rose and he felt the cool breeze

06:34.220 --> 06:38.660
and he felt that calm and everything, he was
amazed. I don’t remember, he relays that

06:38.660 --> 06:44.170
I came to him and he said, “Mother you are
so kind. Despite the fact I came with this

06:44.170 --> 06:53.740
kind of idea you gave me realisation.” Because
Indians know what realisation means, here

06:53.740 --> 07:00.520
people even don’t know that, so the situation
is much worse. They know that realisation

07:00.520 --> 07:07.710
means cool breeze, it means you must get cool
breeze flowing from you. They know it, you

07:07.710 --> 07:15.600
do not know that. So the situation becomes
much worse here, that the faith in Sahaja

07:15.600 --> 07:22.400
Yoga goes.
Now this is not blind faith. This is the faith.

07:22.400 --> 07:27.450
One is blind faith and another is the faith,
means that you have now seen it and now you

07:27.450 --> 07:33.040
have faith in it. It’s not like people,
many I have seen many people saying, “I

07:33.040 --> 07:38.770
believe” and ” I believe” and “I believe”,
out of what? Is a thing that you have felt,

07:38.770 --> 07:42.520
experienced, you have had it and then you
believe it. Of course you are not obliging

07:42.520 --> 07:50.270
anybody by having faith, that’s one thing.
It’s the grace of God that has really been

07:50.270 --> 08:01.419
kind, extremely gracious, to grant this to
you. By that you do not oblige God or anybody,

08:01.419 --> 08:18.880
nor Me. But despite that, it’s time. What
grace, what grace, what beauty, what love.

08:18.880 --> 08:29.720
It happens.
But this faith does not settle down. Now the

08:29.720 --> 08:37.120
reasons for that are many, but is a very dangerous
thing. You can rationalise it. I’ve seen

08:37.120 --> 08:41.979
people who go away, then again come back and
they said, “Mother we are sorry, I mean

08:41.979 --> 08:47.380
we were, we just doubted You, went away this
that, I started thinking about it and I spoilt

08:47.380 --> 08:54.450
it and I lost it, and I said ‘oh it was
just temporary,’ I went away.” Why not,

08:54.450 --> 09:03.750
once you get realisation settle down with
it for a while? Why not see for yourself what

09:03.750 --> 09:11.380
it is? All the gurus who take money and have
made a money making proposition out of God,

09:11.380 --> 09:19.200
which is absolutely against God, anti-Christ
and anti all that is Divine, people stick

09:19.200 --> 09:25.560
onto them much more, like leeches.
One thing of course there is that they mesmerise,

09:25.560 --> 09:29.800
there is no freedom, you cannot get out of
them, one thing, I agree. But the second is

09:29.800 --> 09:35.070
the money. They get involved with them because
they have paid for it and they have to stick

09:35.070 --> 09:39.740
onto it, because they have paid for it. And
so many people have told Me Mother you better

09:39.740 --> 09:44.170
take money from everybody who comes in and
they will stick on. I mean this is going too

09:44.170 --> 09:50.470
far. I have too much respect for humanity.
I respect you too much, I do not think you

09:50.470 --> 09:55.180
could be that low, I cannot think, and those
who are that low cannot get realisation also

09:55.180 --> 10:03.680
perhaps. Maybe if you get it it’s not worth
it you see. We do not light lamps in paper

10:03.680 --> 10:12.850
bags, do we? People have to be of some caliber
to get realisation.

10:12.850 --> 10:22.880
But the faith, faith in Sahaja Yoga is the
only way you can rise and understand and move

10:22.880 --> 10:36.589
and grow with it. The faith has to be so great
that nothing should disturb you. Look at these

10:36.589 --> 10:43.500
flowers sometimes, how delicate they are.
And it rains and sometimes it’s too sunny,

10:43.500 --> 10:50.480
especially in London. You don’t know what
sort of a climate it is, it’s a funny climate

10:50.480 --> 10:57.470
absolutely! But the flower to stand up to
that, because they have faith in the tree

10:57.470 --> 11:10.520
on which they are born. That’s the strength-giving
thing. And to know it, fully, so that you

11:10.520 --> 11:18.250
love it more and more and imbibe within you
more, is the only way you can really establish

11:18.250 --> 11:30.399
yourself firmly into the strength of the Divine
Power.

11:30.399 --> 11:43.589
The understanding of Sahaja Yoga is not mental
I told you yesterday, is not mental understanding.

11:43.589 --> 11:47.460
You cannot understand it through brains. If
you try to understand it through brains you

11:47.460 --> 11:56.089
get away from it. Because you cannot explain
how it works out. It’s a miraculous thing,

11:56.089 --> 12:03.540
it’s a mystery. It’s a mystery. God is
a mystery for man, will remain a mystery to

12:03.540 --> 12:11.220
a point, but he (man) can become His power.
He can become an instrument of His power.

12:11.220 --> 12:18.600
So you cannot comprehend the complete thing
through your brains. You cannot even comprehend

12:18.600 --> 12:27.290
a little bit through your brains. Only thing
is when you see it happening, you see it working

12:27.290 --> 12:37.160
out, the effects of that experience which
are put on your brain, that gives you faith.

12:37.160 --> 12:44.089
How do you have faith in a man? Say there
is a man who is very astute, straightforward.

12:44.089 --> 12:52.010
You give him ten pounds. He spends nine pounds
three pence, returns the rest to you. Then

12:52.010 --> 12:58.480
you give some more money. Again he does the
same way; he returns all the money that is

12:58.480 --> 13:03.680
due. By mistake he forgets, he again comes
and says, “This is it”. So you develop

13:03.680 --> 13:08.670
that faith in him. It has not come out of
your intellectual understanding of the man.

13:08.670 --> 13:14.459
A man may be very good, maybe a very great
cheat, could be a ‘very fine’ gentleman,

13:14.459 --> 13:20.820
very well dressed. Mostly I have seen sometimes
when I see these pictures where they show

13:20.820 --> 13:28.190
the bank robber especially the gentleman is
absolutely top class. He wears beautiful lined

13:28.190 --> 13:34.910
dresses you see, he walks with an umbrella,
straight forward and he’s absolutely, you

13:34.910 --> 13:41.830
can see his face and I mean it’s chiseled
completely: beautiful figure and extremely

13:41.830 --> 13:48.610
innocent face and all that he puts it out
very well. That’s why he can befool you.

13:48.610 --> 13:53.899
He can befool people very well and he can
get things out of them.

13:53.899 --> 14:08.870
But, in Sahaja Yoga, when you start feeling
it, seeing it, how it works, when you saw

14:08.870 --> 14:15.290
this man, seeing the way he works you have
no faith in him anymore. You start seeing

14:15.290 --> 14:24.220
how Sahaja Yoga works and then you have faith
in it. And that is faith, that is not reasoning.

14:24.220 --> 14:29.500
Actually by reasoning you have achieved nothing
so far if you see it properly. For example,

14:29.500 --> 14:40.240
you see, all scientific laws, were discovered,
were seen, were felt. Even if something comes

14:40.240 --> 14:46.050
into my mind by thinking, it could be just
an imagination unless and until I see [that]

14:46.050 --> 14:50.930
it works. Anything that does not work out
doesn’t become a law for us.

14:50.930 --> 14:59.480
So for Sahaja Yoga you have to see it. But
not with the idea that, “Let me see if it

14:59.480 --> 15:05.690
works or not”, that’s not the way, but
just the seeing of it and understanding it.

15:05.690 --> 15:16.589
If you sit down and reason out, Sahaja Yoga
– you will be lost in wilderness absolutely!

15:16.589 --> 15:26.290
But how it works? I’ll give you a very simple
example. We have got the gentleman here, he

15:26.290 --> 15:33.709
wrote a thesis. I don’t know how many years
he was working with it. He could not get through

15:33.709 --> 15:40.880
it. He had not even made a bond out of it.
It’s a very material style of understanding

15:40.880 --> 15:48.110
but still. So he came to Me and he said, “Mother
now I leave it at your feet and I surrender

15:48.110 --> 15:50.329
it to You. Do whatever you please.” So I
looked at it. He said, “Are you not going

15:50.329 --> 15:57.370
to read it?” I said, “No need to read.”
I just put a little bandhan on it; put My

15:57.370 --> 16:07.870
hand there, finished, that’s all. That’s
all I did. By next year he was a Dr., He was.

16:07.870 --> 16:13.720
How it happens?
Today we received another letter from Portugal.

16:13.720 --> 16:19.630
There was one fellow, whom we had sent all
the articles, everything, but he had certain

16:19.630 --> 16:25.620
problems with his sister and mother and all
that, so he didn’t want to do much of Sahaja

16:25.620 --> 16:30.990
Yoga. And was another one, who wanted to do
it. And he writes to Me saying that, “I

16:30.990 --> 16:33.990
received everything. I don’t know. He does
not know my address. How it has come to me

16:33.990 --> 16:39.230
I don’t know. Who has dropped it in my house?
I do not know how it has come to me; the address

16:39.230 --> 16:43.220
was of that fellow.” And that gentleman
who has this address, does not know his address.

16:43.220 --> 17:01.690
It’s that mysterious. There are angels.
God has many hands, many eyes. He’s God

17:01.690 --> 17:11.769
Almighty, He’s very powerful. So after Sahaja
yoga you cannot comprehend Him. You can only

17:11.769 --> 17:17.069
see Him at work and you can see His laws working
out and you can see it works out.

17:17.069 --> 17:22.319
A simple thing there’s a gentlemen sitting
here, now you put your hand on that. There

17:22.319 --> 17:28.139
was another case, very recently it happened,
one gentlemen came to Me and asked Me, “Why

17:28.139 --> 17:33.330
everybody is asking about my father? What’s
the matter?” I said, “Really? They’re

17:33.330 --> 17:35.419
all asking about your father?” I went further
to tell him about his father and he was surprised.

17:35.419 --> 17:43.159
“How do you know?” I said, “I just know.”
“But,” he said, “how did they all know

17:43.159 --> 17:47.369
that there was something wrong with my father?”
I said, “There is a way of finding out.

17:47.369 --> 17:53.179
Everybody, even a little child knows it, something
wrong with your father.” So when he put

17:53.179 --> 17:58.590
his hands toward that gentleman the Right
Heart was catching, everybody’s Right Heart.

17:58.590 --> 18:05.230
This is fathers. So he asked what’s wrong
with your father? Now see the mystery. You

18:05.230 --> 18:11.840
see sahaja yogis also take it for granted.
See the mystery, the alertness of the vibrations,

18:11.840 --> 18:17.100
just think of it, how they work it out, that
you just extend the hands at somebody and

18:17.100 --> 18:23.090
the vibrations tell you this gentleman is
catching the right heart. The Mother has told

18:23.090 --> 18:28.239
you that it means the father’s problem,
but that decoding I have done, but what about

18:28.239 --> 18:38.200
these? These vibrations they look so silent.
Do they think? How do they tell about anyone

18:38.200 --> 18:44.330
who may not be here, present. You can tell.
And if Sahaja Yogis just start telling about

18:44.330 --> 18:47.989
that person that, “This has happened, that
has happened, and this person has got this,

18:47.989 --> 18:52.059
and that person has got that.” Sitting down
here!

18:52.059 --> 19:02.629
It’s a tremendous dynamic force which is
working it out. But if you have no faith,

19:02.629 --> 19:10.299
then the same vibrations know that you have
no faith: They know you out and out, absolutely

19:10.299 --> 19:24.950
out and out, They know you too well. It is
They only who play around with you and put

19:24.950 --> 19:34.749
you into problems, so that you realise that
you have been trying to cheat yourself. You

19:34.749 --> 19:45.690
are cheating your own Spirit. You are not
truthful to yours Self and it would be like

19:45.690 --> 19:51.460
taking a dagger and putting it through and
being very happy, ‘Oh how I have cheated

19:51.460 --> 19:59.730
myself.‘ It’s that foolish and stupid
I tell you. They know you too well. And they

19:59.730 --> 20:09.769
just take you round and put you into a problem
to realise that, “Do not cheat anymore!”

20:09.769 --> 20:18.029
These dangers are there for all the people
who get realisation.

20:18.029 --> 20:22.529
And the another realisation one should have,
when you see others around here, the kind

20:22.529 --> 20:29.629
of people that come in. All kinds of people
have come. And when you start judging them

20:29.629 --> 20:34.429
also you should know that if you become like
that, you will also have the same problem,

20:34.429 --> 20:39.570
even after realisation possibly. For example
some people start suddenly sulking in Sahaja

20:39.570 --> 20:44.989
Yoga, say, after realisation, for nothing
at all. They should be, very aware of it immediately

20:44.989 --> 20:53.299
give it up, and become cheerful. Is there
a negative force pulling them down to sulk?

20:53.299 --> 21:04.159
First sign of being a Sahaja Yogi is to have
a very cheerful disposition. Look at the flowers,

21:04.159 --> 21:11.609
look at them. Have you ever seen any flower
which is not dead [that’s] not cheerful?

21:11.609 --> 21:22.399
If they are even at the fag end of their life,
they’ll try to cheer you. That is the first

21:22.399 --> 21:35.729
sign, and all such signs should be expressed,
not artificially, but really spontaneously,

21:35.729 --> 21:41.850
from within.
And nothing should disturb you which is trivial,

21:41.850 --> 21:48.159
useless. If you have faith in Sahaja Yoga,
then you must know you are here for a tremendous

21:48.159 --> 22:02.799
work of human emancipation. You have a very
great responsibility. You represent that part

22:02.799 --> 22:13.830
of creation which is the most important, the
most vital. And if you fail it, it’s absolutely

22:13.830 --> 22:31.859
fatal also.
All this works out in such a manner, that

22:31.859 --> 22:38.960
it builds up tremendous sense of security
within you, that you know you are standing

22:38.960 --> 22:48.409
on the Truth. Hold it with both your hands;
you’ll grow on it. You’ll enjoy yourself.

22:48.409 --> 23:01.499
Life will be so much better, much more beautiful.
And it is only through you the whole world

23:01.499 --> 23:15.749
is going to be saved. So strengthen yourself,
strengthen your arms and strengthen your feet.

23:15.749 --> 23:23.220
The faith is the strength of Sahaja Yoga,
not the brainwaves that you have about it.

23:23.220 --> 23:27.789
Of course you need it sometimes to argue with
some intellectuals, you see, as I’ve told

23:27.789 --> 23:35.919
Gregoire to write the last two chapters for
all these “Rock of Gibraltars”. But, for

23:35.919 --> 23:42.690
you the greatest thing is the faith, to enjoy
it, because you have seen it, you have known

23:42.690 --> 23:50.840
it, you have found it. It is with you! You
are the master of it! It is at your service,

23:50.840 --> 23:59.149
and so beautiful, so loving, so kind.
Maybe today is the last day, I’m here. I’m

23:59.149 --> 24:09.649
going now. I may not be here for one and a
half months or so. I hope so, I’ll be back,

24:09.649 --> 24:18.529
by the 17th of October or so. Whatever it
is, even if I am away or anything, Sahaja

24:18.529 --> 24:24.639
Yoga exists everywhere. Within you it is working,
without you it is working, everywhere it is

24:24.639 --> 24:32.919
working. So you see for yourself. To see it
you have to go and see people and meet them

24:32.919 --> 24:35.979
and talk to them and find it out how it works.

24:35.979 --> 24:43.859
And develop that faith that gives you the
sense of security. There are so many ways

24:43.859 --> 24:49.099
of cleansing yourself, which you know, you
can find out. Meet each other. As many times

24:49.099 --> 24:55.359
as you can, call each other for tea, meet
each other, go around England. I was thinking

24:55.359 --> 25:01.489
when I’m out it would be better that you
go round to different centres, meet people,

25:01.489 --> 25:07.989
get organised, get more people. Tell them,
talk to them about it and do something.

25:07.989 --> 25:18.659
But they’ll judge you by your faith. And
when you have found out the Reality, the faith

25:18.659 --> 25:29.629
should be much greater than any of these fanatics
have, any of these nonsensical people have.

25:29.629 --> 25:35.109
But for faith, you must have the quality.
Only people of quality can have that kind

25:35.109 --> 25:45.720
of faith, not ordinary people. They’ll fall
off. All the flowers do not get transformed

25:45.720 --> 25:52.729
into the fruit state. You are transformed
into fruit state, but all the fruits do not

25:52.729 --> 26:03.529
come up to their maturity, because they lack
faith, the strength.

26:03.529 --> 26:13.269
Gather up your strength. It’s all behind
you, it is within you, it’s around you.

26:13.269 --> 26:22.649
Everywhere there is light, within and without.
Try to work it out properly. Do not condemn

26:22.649 --> 26:27.820
yourself or condemn others, but know that
you are something that you are standing on

26:27.820 --> 26:34.960
the Truth. And you are in for the Kingdom
of God, which is promised to you, which you

26:34.960 --> 26:41.669
are in already walking in that. You are settled
in there, just enjoy that beauty.

26:41.669 --> 27:04.489
May God bless you all.
Is there any water for Me? Water? Now I would

27:04.489 --> 27:09.799
like to know how many new people are there,
and, yes, just come forward those who are

27:09.799 --> 27:13.999
new, and we’ll have a look at them. Those
who have come for the first time please come

27:13.999 --> 27:20.999
in and then I would suggest, that those who
come for the first time, must, “please come”,

27:20.999 --> 27:29.899
must get to it, you see? It’s a serious
matter, you see, it’s not just a shopping

27:29.899 --> 27:36.399
centre. It’s not guru shopping. It is your
own shopping I should say, it’s your own

27:36.399 --> 27:45.529
being. So take to it seriously and work it
out properly. Ask others. Not that in any

27:45.529 --> 27:50.159
way they are higher or lower. Only thing,
they got their realisation before you came

27:50.159 --> 27:57.349
to me. So it’s alright, doesn’t matter,
they’ll tell you what is to be done.

27:57.349 --> 28:05.159
In Sahaja Yoga there is no subscription, there
is no compulsion, there is no membership as

28:05.159 --> 28:12.080
I told you. There is no way of aligning you
with Sahaja Yoga, no nothing. It’s your

28:12.080 --> 28:16.759
freedom, complete freedom. Your freedom is
to be worshipped and to be respected if you

28:16.759 --> 28:24.759
have to achieve the highest of the highest.
You have to be absolutely free because that

28:24.759 --> 28:30.299
is the complete freedom you have to achieve.
So nobody is going to force you to do anything

28:30.299 --> 28:38.799
or compel you to do anything. No! You are
left alone to yourself.

28:38.799 --> 28:51.519
No doubt there is a Kundalini within you which
rises and there is in every human a possibility

28:51.519 --> 28:59.639
of achieving realisation. Every human being
should receive realisation. But it’s a real

28:59.639 --> 29:11.179
work; it’s living work, and living work
takes time. If you people are of that caliber,

29:11.179 --> 29:21.269
you will become great fruits of this creation.
I will work as much as I can to keep you up

29:21.269 --> 29:27.809
there, all my level best. I’ve worked very
hard and I’ll always work, and all of them

29:27.809 --> 29:39.549
are willing to help you out. They have no
problem. You too become like them, very soon.

29:39.549 --> 29:45.070
Now about Kundalini I must have spoken I don’t
know how many times and there are lots of

29:45.070 --> 29:50.529
tapes with us. It’s all again intellectual
feat, you see? Let’s see if the light is

29:50.529 --> 29:54.840
there, let us see the light, then we’ll
talk about it, isn’t it? I mean if I have

29:54.840 --> 30:00.019
to put the lights on I have to just press
the button. That’s what it is really, because

30:00.019 --> 30:05.719
it’s all built in. Once it happens to you
then you ask Me about the engineering, it’s

30:05.719 --> 30:09.840
better, than to have the headache before and
then the light.

30:09.840 --> 30:17.509
So let’s work it out that way, then later
on you can go through, you can find out for

30:17.509 --> 30:26.349
yourself how it works, what is the system
that works it out, what is God’s plan for

30:26.349 --> 30:33.539
us, everything. Gradually you see it for yourself
that this is the baptism that is promised

30:33.539 --> 30:41.429
to you, this is the real re-birth that has
been prophesised before, this is the time

30:41.429 --> 30:50.389
that is promised that somebody will come and
do this job for you. And it is here, that

30:50.389 --> 30:53.820
you receive it.

30:53.820 --> 31:00.859
No religion is to be condemned because they
are different steps in your growth, but, you

31:00.859 --> 31:10.149
should know what is real and what is unreal,
that’s very important. Once you learn this

31:10.149 --> 31:17.529
science of God’s ways, then you start talking
about it. Before that you just see for yourself.

31:17.529 --> 31:25.190
Be just witnesses and achieve something out
of it, and make the best.

31:25.190 --> 31:29.269
May God bless you all
Now let’s have the feet like that straight,

31:29.269 --> 31:38.979
just like that. Just like that, yes. And put
your hands towards Me. For anything small

31:38.979 --> 31:43.200
just do not get disturbed. Keep your eyes
shut. If you can put your hands on the lap

31:43.200 --> 31:48.129
it’s alright, because you’ll be comfortable.
Be comfortable! If you have any discomfort

31:48.129 --> 31:52.029
in the stomach or anything tightness you can
loosen it, and it’s for your comfort only.

31:52.029 --> 31:56.179
I want you to be comfortable. That one thing
is that you should be comfortable bodily.

31:56.179 --> 32:00.649
Though the Kundalini’s such a sweet thing,
She’s your Mother, and She rises without

32:00.649 --> 32:04.570
giving any trouble.

32:04.570 --> 32:13.399
Now close your eyes. Just close your eyes.
Everyone.

32:13.399 --> 32:25.539
Aank ke band kar lijiye (Hindi: close your
eyes)

32:25.539 --> 32:35.369
Now there are some centres within us, they
might get a little obstructed, supposing you

32:35.369 --> 32:39.729
feel guilty for nothing at all, I mean there’s
nothing to feel guilty you see? You are facing

32:39.729 --> 32:46.859
somebody who is love, so how can you feel
guilty before such a person who is just love?

32:46.859 --> 32:57.190
So have no guilt of any kind. Then you have
to forgive. You have to forgive all the people.

32:57.190 --> 33:02.119
Not to bear any bitterness just now, just
forgive, because by bearing that bitterness

33:02.119 --> 33:08.700
you really embitter yourself, you do not torture
the other person. And lastly you have to ask

33:08.700 --> 33:15.830
for forgiveness, if you have done any mistake
by ignorance or anything. You just ask for

33:15.830 --> 33:27.019
simple forgiveness.
All the obstructions can be overcome by the

33:27.019 --> 33:35.929
rising Kundalini, She does that. Just relax.
It will happen by itself, you are not to do

33:35.929 --> 33:41.559
anything. Keep your attention absolutely loose,
if there are thoughts, let them come, don’t

33:41.559 --> 33:45.929
worry, they will stop themselves. You don’t
have to stop them. Do not put in any effort,

33:45.929 --> 33:52.529
just leave it alone. It will work out. It
will just rise and work it out. You just leave

33:52.529 --> 34:26.600
it alone.
Suddenly the thoughts stop. But you are aware,

34:26.600 --> 34:30.510
you are not sleeping, you are not in a trance
or anything you are absolutely aware, but

34:30.510 --> 34:39.710
you reach a point where there are no thoughts.
But do not try to do that. Do not try to do

34:39.710 --> 34:43.899
that. And when the Kundalini pierces the fontanelle
bone area, the talu, you start getting cool

34:43.899 --> 34:43.899
breeze in the hands. In both the hands you
start getting cool breeze and also from your

34:43.899 --> 34:43.899
head, you start getting cool breeze. First
a hot breeze I think and then the cool breeze,

34:43.899 --> 34:43.909
for many people it happens like that, doesn’t
matter.

34:43.909 --> 34:43.909
Good you see, you can feel it on his head,
here. You have a breathing trouble have you?

34:43.909 --> 34:43.919
Do you have a breathing problem normally?
Do you have any breathing problem? Hmm? No

34:43.919 --> 34:43.919
just don’t breathe, just leave it alone.
Just.. Don’t you think it is too much breathing

34:43.919 --> 34:43.919
or is it automatically it happens? Happening
automatically. This ever happens before?

34:43.919 --> 34:43.919
Seeker: No.
Shri Mataji: It never happened before you

34:43.919 --> 34:43.929
say? Hmm? You have been to some guru or someone?
You’ll be all right. It will work out. You’re

34:43.929 --> 34:43.929
all right. You’ll be all right. Is he, is
he all right? Are you all right? How are you

34:43.929 --> 34:43.929
feeling?

34:43.929 --> 34:43.940
Seeker: I’m feeling hot on the right.

34:43.940 --> 34:43.940
Shri Mataji: Eh? Can you sit there? Would
be better nearby. Let’s look at her. Just

34:43.940 --> 34:43.940
look after her. Just sit down. You’re all
right. Now what about her? Can you see? After

34:43.940 --> 34:43.950
[?] your vibrations will be all right. Cooly
can you see the vibrations of this gentleman.

34:43.950 --> 34:43.950
What about these Indians up front can you
see there vibrations? This gentleman, this

34:43.950 --> 34:43.950
gentleman, there are two ladies there. Are
you all right now better? Good. Just can you

34:43.950 --> 34:43.960
come up and tie up the Kundalini? Come and
help, tie her up. No, just proceed. [?] heart,

34:43.960 --> 34:43.960
centre heart. Keep your eyes open. You have
done some breathing for exercises? No? You

34:43.960 --> 34:43.970
have not been to any guru or spiritualist
or anyone? You never get this trouble normally?

34:43.970 --> 34:43.970
No? Come here. I’ll just talk to you and
it will be all right. Come here can you come

34:43.970 --> 34:43.970
here please? Just come here. Just get up,
by Me, come. Come down. Come forward; come

34:43.970 --> 34:43.980
forward sit, come here sit down. Can you sit
on the ground? All right. Be comfortable.

34:43.980 --> 34:43.980
You have been to any guru shop? Then what
is the sense of insecurity you have? You have

34:43.980 --> 34:43.990
some sense of insecurity, what is it? You
are not well? You had some mental troubles?

34:43.990 --> 34:43.990
Did you? You have? What is the problem? Tell
Me. Have you got some [?] with you? You are

34:43.990 --> 34:43.990
not well?

34:43.990 --> 34:43.990
Seeker: I’m fine
Shri Mataji: You are all right?

34:43.990 --> 34:44.000
Seeker: I’m fine
Shri Mataji: Keep good health. What work do

34:44.000 --> 34:44.000
you do? Hmm? Can you feel it?”No, what work
do you do? Tell me. What work do you do? No

34:44.000 --> 34:44.000
work?
Seeker: I do nothing.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.000
Shri Mataji: Do nothing?
Seeker: Nothing.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.010
Shri Mataji: Why? Your working off dole, just
hold it, hold it in your hands, you don’t

34:44.010 --> 34:44.010
do any work at all? You never get this? You’re
not well?

34:44.010 --> 34:44.010
Seeker: No
