00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.940
Now first before meditating, in your heart,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.119
or, you should see in your heart,

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:24.391
and there try to put your Guru in the core of it.

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:30.002
After establishing in the heart,

00:00:35.108 --> 00:00:37.821
you must bow to that

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.424
with full devotion and dedication.

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:51.408
Now, whatever you do with your mind, after Realization,

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:58.675
is not imagination because now your mind, your imagination,

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:02.361
is itself enlightened.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:10.277
So project yourself in such a way that you humble down

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:16.481
at the feet of your Guru

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:37.442
and now ask for the necessary temperament needed for meditation,

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:43.375
or atmosphere needed for meditation.

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:51.188
Meditation is when you are one with the Divine.

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:57.759
Now if there are thoughts coming in,

00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:02.945
first you have to say the first mantra, of course,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.162
and then watch inside.

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.736
Also you must say mantra of Ganesha, will help some people.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:17.811
And then you should watch inside

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:28.465
and see for yourself which is the biggest hurdle.

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:32.762
First the thought.

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:42.441
Now, for the thought, you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara,

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:49.508
that, “Twameva sakshat Nirvichar sakshat

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:52.745
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha”

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:54.745
Should say it thrice.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.728
Now we come to the hurdle of your ego

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:37.814
because, you see, the thought has stopped now, no doubt,

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.336
but there’s still a pressure on the head.

00:03:40.722 --> 00:03:44.770
So, if it is ego, you have to say,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.885
“Twameva sakshat Mahatahamkaara…” – Mahat means ‘the great’,

00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:53.340
ahamkara means ‘the ego’  – “…sakshat

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.720
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.”

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:01.061
Say it thrice.

00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:47.092
Now, even now, if you find that ego is still there,

00:04:47.504 --> 00:04:51.848
then you have to raise your left side

00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:54.498
to push it back to the right hand side,

00:04:54.618 --> 00:04:58.597
with your hand; one hand towards the photograph.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:06.349
Push the left side higher and right side lower

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.044
so the ego and super-ego get the balance.

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:20.477
Do it seven times.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.252
Try to feel it, how you are feeling inside, you see.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:46.578
Now you raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:56.340
Again raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

00:05:58.188 --> 00:06:03.455
Again raise your Kundalini and tie it up.

00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:18.988
Now at the Sahastrara you should say the mantra of Sahastrara, thrice.

00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:16.835
Now it’s opened out if you see.

00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:20.833
Now you can open again your Sahastrara like this.

00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:24.550
Just take it down again and see that you are stationed there.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.975
Once this has been done then you go into meditation.

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:33.394
This is like cleansing, you see, called as nyasa.

00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:54.009
Now, if you find any other obstruction, you can also say,

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:57.555
like, if you have got, say, Mahakali’s problem,

00:07:57.675 --> 00:08:01.391
you can say that mantra, clear it

00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:04.728
and then you sit down for meditation.

00:08:13.818 --> 00:08:16.676
Any individual thing, you can take it out,

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.135
like, if you have the ego problem, if you think,

00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.556
then you should start with Mahatahamkara.

00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:25.099
It is what you have to find out: What is your problem?

00:08:25.219 --> 00:08:30.280
Where is the Kundalini stopping? You can feel it within yourself.

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:58.174
Some of you may not feel.

00:08:58.294 --> 00:09:01.906
If you do not feel it, feel it on your fingers.

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:03.934
If you are not feeling within yourself

00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:07.494
then feel it on your fingers, you can feel it.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.026
Ah, Better.

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:30.548
How is it now? Better? Where is the problem? Hmm?

00:09:37.082 --> 00:09:38.349
Yogi: Central heart

00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:41.745
Shri Mataji: Central heart?

00:09:42.087 --> 00:09:44.422
Alright, hold your breath.

00:09:46.206 --> 00:09:49.872
Not with great force, just ordinarily. Alright?

00:09:49.992 --> 00:09:52.361
Sakshat Jagadamba 10x

00:10:05.534 --> 00:10:07.486
Alright? Leave it.

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:21.836
Better now? Once again? Alright, hold your breath.

00:10:22.758 --> 00:10:24.291
Sakshat Jagadamba… Haa.

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:33.266
Leave it.

00:10:39.732 --> 00:10:45.597
Better. Keep your eyes open. Again. Hold it.

00:10:45.717 --> 00:10:47.926
Sakshat Jagadamba…

00:10:57.662 --> 00:11:02.884
Leave it. Better now?

00:11:08.152 --> 00:11:11.663
Much relief. Alright?

00:11:12.202 --> 00:11:18.525
I mean, now left side. Put your left hand towards Me,

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:23.762
right hand up there. Left hand towards Me, right hand like that…

00:11:50.037 --> 00:11:53.556
Hmm. Like this. Douglas, like this.

00:11:58.883 --> 00:12:01.645
Better? It’s liver.

00:12:06.022 --> 00:12:11.321
Over-thinking gives you liver also. Better.
