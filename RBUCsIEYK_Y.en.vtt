00:01.560 --> 00:05.940
Now first before meditating, in your heart,

00:06.230 --> 00:12.119
or, you should see in your heart,

00:12.895 --> 00:24.391
and there try to put your Guru in the core of it.

00:27.161 --> 00:30.002
After establishing in the heart,

00:35.108 --> 00:37.821
you must bow to that

00:42.379 --> 00:45.424
with full devotion and dedication.

00:46.717 --> 00:51.408
Now, whatever you do with your mind, after Realization,

00:52.551 --> 00:58.675
is not imagination because now your mind, your imagination,

00:58.795 --> 01:02.361
is itself enlightened.

01:04.099 --> 01:10.277
So project yourself in such a way that you humble down

01:11.967 --> 01:16.481
at the feet of your Guru

01:21.903 --> 01:37.442
and now ask for the necessary temperament needed for meditation,

01:37.562 --> 01:43.375
or atmosphere needed for meditation.

01:44.034 --> 01:51.188
Meditation is when you are one with the Divine.

01:54.387 --> 01:57.759
Now if there are thoughts coming in,

01:59.838 --> 02:02.945
first you have to say the first mantra, of course,

02:03.170 --> 02:05.162
and then watch inside.

02:09.309 --> 02:13.736
Also you must say mantra of Ganesha, will help some people.

02:14.696 --> 02:17.811
And then you should watch inside

02:22.649 --> 02:28.465
and see for yourself which is the biggest hurdle.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.762
First the thought.

02:36.266 --> 02:42.441
Now, for the thought, you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara,

02:42.561 --> 02:49.508
that, “Twameva sakshat Nirvichar sakshat

02:49.628 --> 02:52.745
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha”

02:53.245 --> 02:54.745
Should say it thrice.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.728
Now we come to the hurdle of your ego

03:34.848 --> 03:37.814
because, you see, the thought has stopped now, no doubt,

03:37.934 --> 03:40.336
but there’s still a pressure on the head.

03:40.722 --> 03:44.770
So, if it is ego, you have to say,

03:44.890 --> 03:49.885
“Twameva sakshat Mahatahamkaara…” – Mahat means ‘the great’,

03:50.005 --> 03:53.340
ahamkara means ‘the ego’  – “…sakshat

03:53.460 --> 03:57.720
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.”

03:59.056 --> 04:01.061
Say it thrice.

04:42.358 --> 04:47.092
Now, even now, if you find that ego is still there,

04:47.504 --> 04:51.848
then you have to raise your left side

04:51.968 --> 04:54.498
to push it back to the right hand side,

04:54.618 --> 04:58.597
with your hand; one hand towards the photograph.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.349
Push the left side higher and right side lower

05:06.469 --> 05:10.044
so the ego and super-ego get the balance.

05:18.546 --> 05:20.477
Do it seven times.

05:22.310 --> 05:26.252
Try to feel it, how you are feeling inside, you see.

05:38.922 --> 05:46.578
Now you raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

05:49.367 --> 05:56.340
Again raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

05:58.188 --> 06:03.455
Again raise your Kundalini and tie it up.

06:11.574 --> 06:18.988
Now at the Sahastrara you should say the mantra of Sahastrara, thrice.

07:14.478 --> 07:16.835
Now it’s opened out if you see.

07:17.478 --> 07:20.833
Now you can open again your Sahastrara like this.

07:20.957 --> 07:24.550
Just take it down again and see that you are stationed there.

07:24.670 --> 07:27.975
Once this has been done then you go into meditation.

07:28.095 --> 07:33.394
This is like cleansing, you see, called as nyasa.

07:50.431 --> 07:54.009
Now, if you find any other obstruction, you can also say,

07:54.129 --> 07:57.555
like, if you have got, say, Mahakali’s problem,

07:57.675 --> 08:01.391
you can say that mantra, clear it

08:01.511 --> 08:04.728
and then you sit down for meditation.

08:13.818 --> 08:16.676
Any individual thing, you can take it out,

08:16.796 --> 08:19.135
like, if you have the ego problem, if you think,

08:19.255 --> 08:21.556
then you should start with Mahatahamkara.

08:21.676 --> 08:25.099
It is what you have to find out: What is your problem?

08:25.219 --> 08:30.280
Where is the Kundalini stopping? You can feel it within yourself.

08:56.116 --> 08:58.174
Some of you may not feel.

08:58.294 --> 09:01.906
If you do not feel it, feel it on your fingers.

09:02.026 --> 09:03.934
If you are not feeling within yourself

09:04.054 --> 09:07.494
then feel it on your fingers, you can feel it.

09:10.590 --> 09:13.026
Ah, Better.

09:25.279 --> 09:30.548
How is it now? Better? Where is the problem? Hmm?

09:37.082 --> 09:38.349
Yogi: Central heart

09:39.531 --> 09:41.745
Shri Mataji: Central heart?

09:42.087 --> 09:44.422
Alright, hold your breath.

09:46.206 --> 09:49.872
Not with great force, just ordinarily. Alright?

09:49.992 --> 09:52.361
Sakshat Jagadamba 10x

10:05.534 --> 10:07.486
Alright? Leave it.

10:15.778 --> 10:21.836
Better now? Once again? Alright, hold your breath.

10:22.758 --> 10:24.291
Sakshat Jagadamba… Haa.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.266
Leave it.

10:39.732 --> 10:45.597
Better. Keep your eyes open. Again. Hold it.

10:45.717 --> 10:47.926
Sakshat Jagadamba…

10:57.662 --> 11:02.884
Leave it. Better now?

11:08.152 --> 11:11.663
Much relief. Alright?

11:12.202 --> 11:18.525
I mean, now left side. Put your left hand towards Me,

11:18.645 --> 11:23.762
right hand up there. Left hand towards Me, right hand like that…

11:50.037 --> 11:53.556
Hmm. Like this. Douglas, like this.

11:58.883 --> 12:01.645
Better? It’s liver.

12:06.022 --> 12:11.321
Over-thinking gives you liver also. Better.
