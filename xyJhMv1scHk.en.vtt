00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.256
For the very first time, you, you, all of
you come in the second row.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.206
These are some exceptional people,
they have come for the first time.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.656
You have also come for the first
time, then you too come here in the front.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.423
Yes!

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.506
Please come.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.806
Just come forward with all these.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.676
Please keep your hands like this.

00:00:33.723 --> 00:00:41.690
Did you all get some cool feel.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.223
Now no one is asking any question to
me, what am I to speak, I don't know.

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:05.276
Sorry!

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.673
How to realise Self?

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:12.906
Is that loud-speaker?

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.923
Keep it here.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.356
This is a very nice question,
how to realise the Self.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.880
The first word, how,
on this one can say

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.100
that Self can be realised and is to
be realised, will be realised, but you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.606
cannot realise Self, you cannot.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.006
You have become a
human being from amoeba.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.240
How did you become?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.495
What did you do?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.773
You got it just as a
blessing from God.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.773
In the same way, Self-realisation
is also the blessing of God.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.289
It is spontaneous.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.373
It is a living thing.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.240
Anything living happens
Spontaneously, by itself.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.006
Do you ever say, “how
am I to sprout a seed?”

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.175
It will sprout by itself.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.700
Why? Because all the mechanism, all the
energy that is required for it to sprout is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.020
embedded in
it, it's built in it.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.756
In the same way, all that is required to
reach to yourself is embedded within you.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.523
It is waiting there for that
moment when it has to happen.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.723
Once you start doing anything
about it, efforts about it, you go wrong.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.700
As I have told you that there is a
force which is sleeping, an energy which

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.523
is called as Kundalini,
in the triangular bone.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.120
That is the 'ankuran', that's the primula,
That rises, which connects you with

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.640
the mains, just like
this one you can say.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.520
A cord that opens out and
connects you with the mains.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.156
But can it do it by itself?
No.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.723
The one who has made
this instrument has to do it.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.923
So it is God who is
going to do that for you.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.323
Or somebody appointed
by God can do it.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.306
So how does it happen?

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.306
Now can you tell Me
how does a seed sprout?

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.925
How does a flower
become a fruit?

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.235
You don't even see
when it happens.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.183
It is done in such a manner that you
cannot even see it with your naked eyes.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.940
Of course if you have some sort of a
camera which gives you delayed actions and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.975
things, then you might.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.986
But with your human eyes
you cannot even see that.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.396
And there are thousands and
thousands of such things happening.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.340
Now your Self-Realisation is the
most important thing and has to happen.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.323
The time has come.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.490
You are created for
that, you have to have it.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.923
The blossom time has come and all of you
have to become fruits. The time has come.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.473
It has to work out.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.490
Only thing what you have done through
your effort you have spoiled the flower.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.580
The other day only I was reading
about Raj Yoga that people are doing.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.823
I am not against Raj
Yoga by any chance.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.573
But Raj Yoga is a
happening within yourself.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.006
With the Kundalini awakening.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.906
You see when the Kundalini is awakened,
then all these happenings take place.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.296
All these closing up of
certain ‘bandhans’ and all

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.675
that, that takes place
and the Kundalini rises.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.020
But it happens in such a short
time, in such a split of a second you

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:10.903
can say, that you cannot feel it's rising
in Sahaja Yoga, in this modern Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.795
Hatha Yoga is also the same.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.223
It's the way how you cleanse yourself
gradually and then the Kundalini rises.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.095
Say I have to come to Delhi.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.975
That means this is
the yoga, the union.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.090
As long as I am away from
Delhi, I am away from Delhi.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.090
Whether it is one mile, two
miles or three hundred miles.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.473
When I meet, that's the point.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.506
That's the yoga.

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:55.456
And that happening is
absolutely spontaneous.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.123
Whether you come by train
or a bullock cart, it depends.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.306
Now ours is a jet style.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.590
All these things happen
within yourself spontaneously.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.923
If you start doing it, if you
do Hatha Yoga, you are gone.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.615
Some realised soul who is a guru, he
knows what chakra you are catching.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.240
Of course that's a very
different style of thing.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.220
That's Ashtanga Yoga.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.700
That's why you have to be in the jungle,
absolutely celibate, unmarried, before

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.790
25 years of age.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.760
You have to do all that Ashtanga,
not only one for making yourself slim or

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.423
something like that
to be a cinema actor.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.940
It's the union with God.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.240
If you pay so much attention to your
only body, physical being, then you are an

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.273
imbalanced person.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.340
You are just spoiling
the whole thing.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.920
Unless and until it is a realised
soul who is of a very high quality and

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.340
who lives in the jungle, as your father,
he works on you before you are exposed

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.323
to this worldly life.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.523
While our so-called Hatha Yoga means
only you create cinema actors out of it.

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:13.217
Today only I had a Hatha
Yogi, today in the morning.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.406
He's not come today, I think.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.040
Poor fellow, he got a
heart attack. It's inevitable.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.306
Every Hatha Yogi
is going towards that.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.273
Because when you start using too much
of your right side, then the left side,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.606
which is the spirit in
the heart, feels unhappy.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.715
Why are you paying so much attention
to your body, this material being?

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.423
So it is so unhappy
that you get the catch.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:47.440
So he was told other
yogas to overcome his heart.

00:07:47.472 --> 00:07:50.840
So how do you get it is
not the point, we just get it.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.290
The Kundalini rises.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.373
It does.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.140
I can show you.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.645
It will pulsate, you will
see in the triangular bone.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:05.570
At the most what we can do, what
is required to be realised, what sort of

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.056
an instrument is required.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.590
For example, children get it so fast
because they are so uncomplicated, so

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.095
simple, they are not artificial.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.420
Secondly, the people who lead a simple
dharmic life in the centre, those who

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:28.640
are married, have got children, leading
a very simple life, satisfied people,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.073
they are the best.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.206
Villagers are the best.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.923
City dwellers are not so good.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.740
City dwellers are horrid.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.900
They give such a headache, they
will give it to you also when you will be

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.223
realised, because you have so
many complications in your head.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.780
Moreover, they read such a lot that
the reading goes into their head and they

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.806
are nowhere, they
are lost in the reading.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.135
Without seeing the reality they
have already got an idea about reality.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.240
So they dwell upon those
ideas, not on the reality itself.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.055
So such people are difficult.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.000
But normally we have seen now even
in the city, horrid city like London, we

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.646
have been able to do.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.840
Quite a lot of people, now about three
hundred Sahaja Yogis are first class there.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:25.329
But apart from that thousands of them I
should say have got it in different places.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:32.360
So in such a country where you see
materialism has come to its verge of

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.356
collapse, it's
easier to work out.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.590
Because now they know that
there's nothing in materialism.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.990
It's much better
to work out there.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.100
Here we are now supposed to be
advancing and we are developing ourselves,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.055
getting into the same
ditch into which they are.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.880
What I'm saying, we can short-circuit it,
we can short-circuit through Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.940
So it happens, you will see for
yourself, the Kundalini will rise, it will

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.590
break through and it will
come out of the Sahasrara.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.606
What is the other question?
142
Seekers: Mother, what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:17.240
Shri Mata ji: Sahaja Yoga

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.475
Sahaja.
‘Saha’ means with, ‘ja’ means born.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.723
‘Sahaja’ means
‘It is born with you.’

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.323
Yoga is born with you.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.490
So that you have the right.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.189
It is your birth right
to get union with God.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.006
It's your birth right.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.790
You are born with Sahaja.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.140
It has a double
meaning as you know.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.673
Sahaja also means union.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.223
But actually the word Sahaja
comes from this ‘Sa-ha-ja.’

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.273
Saha means with, ja means born.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.090
Born with you.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.540
And Sahaja in our talking we
say Sahajme, means easily.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.373
Because it is born with you.
We are breathing now

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.140
so easily

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.240
Because it is born
with us, it is Sahaja.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.820
Supposing for breathing if you have
to stand up on our heads or we had to

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.035
say read books, we would
have been dead long time back.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.239
It comes Sahaja-spontaneous.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.790
We cannot do anything
about it, it's all done for you.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.056
Unnecessarily we are breaking
our heads here and there.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.940
Just wait and
see, it will work out.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.256
The time has come.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.140
This is Sahaja Yoga, is
the Mahayoga as they call it.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.573
They call it as the Mahayoga because
this is, this is the highest of all.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:37.740
Where the Kundalini
rises just like that.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:43.873
But many people have used Sahaja
Yoga just as a great convenience, you see,

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.310
without using the essence of it.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.350
I mean you can give
any name to anything.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.256
And they do all ‘ashaja’ things.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.190
You don't have to do
anything whatsoever. Nothing.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.240
Those who are realised
here, people, will work for you.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.856
It is simple like this.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.890
Supposing you are trying to learn
swimming or you are getting drowned.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.370
The person who is trying to save you
will tell you,” Keep quiet, don't beat your

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.273
hands here and there.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.540
Just keep quiet.”

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.710
And the one who knows how to
swim will lift you up from there, put you

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.756
on the shores and can
teach you swimming.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.730
Then you can help others.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.940
It's very simple.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.245
It's like one light which is
enlightened can enlighten another light.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:30.256
But that light
has to be all right.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.475
So it is that simple.

00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:35.806
It's absolutely simple.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.973
Now how do you light
one light into another light?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.273
How?
Seeker: [Inaudible]

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.235
Shri Mata ji: Yes, that's all.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.240
A light which is already
there enlightens another light.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.900
Now you, this light doesn't
take any credit for that. Nothing!

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.190
It's just your own.
You have to be enlightened.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.390
It's your own right.
You have to have it.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.773
But you want to have some sort
of a difficult situation for everything.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.873
Can't eat food like this.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.323
You want to go round and round.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.490
Why not eat like that?
Then go ahead!

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.540
If you don't want to eat straight
away, then what could I say?

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.623
“That's all right.
You go ahead.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.540
Break your neck.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.580
Come to Me later on.”

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.806
I'll put them right.
Now what to do?

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.923
There are many, who
come like that to Me.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.390
Very difficult cases.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.646
So be simple.
Be like children and have it.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.413
No problem. At least here
seventy-five people are realized.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.890
At least.
Seventy-five persons.
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.906
These are not realised.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940
Shri Mataji: Fifty? Why these are not realized, that’s all?
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.915
All the rest are.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.640
Doctor is realised.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.723
Then who else?
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.530
Shri Mataji: Ha? Here and there.
Who is not realised here?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.313
He has got his
realisation yesterday.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.013
Anyway,
he's realised. Seeker: [ Inaudible]

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:10.395
Shri Mata ji: Isn't it correct?
Seeker: [Inaudible]

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.656
Shri Mata ji: Those who are not realised
can be realised in no time.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.773
What is the second question?

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.440
No question.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.365
He wants it, and that’s it.
That’s it.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:32.340
That's like a real seeker. Ha!

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.290
There's one more question which you
are not asking, which you are feeling it.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.440
That you have known
that Kundalini awakening,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.940
it's a very difficult thing.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.375
Isn't it true?

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:52.670
So, it may be difficult for people
who do not know how to do it,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.673
which is not for Me.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.923
It's the easiest for Me.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.123
My nature is to
awaken Kundalini.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.123
So for people who do not
know the job, it may be difficult.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.283
It may be very, very difficult.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.733
They must be doing
all upside things.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.650
Supposing I do not
know how to operate this.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.316
I may burn My hand and then I'll
say, “My Kundalini was awakened,

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.323
I burnt My hands.” I may burn
My hand. How can that be?

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.385
Kundalini is your own Mother.
Everybody's Mother.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.472
Can you imagine? God
can instil something in you,

00:15:21.496 --> 00:15:24.430
which will burn your
fingers, which will give

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.273
you headaches, which will
make you jump like a frog.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.540
How can it be?

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.815
Oh, there are mad
people like that.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.895
One gentleman came and he's
sitting with both the feet towards Me.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.740
So these people said,
“You can't sit like this.”

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.023
He said, “No, my Kundalini is
awakened and I jump like a frog.”

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.156
So we said, “Why do
you jump like a frog?”

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.690
He said, “My guru said, it is written in the book, that when your Kundalini is awakened you start jumping like a frog.”

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:58.506
I said, “After Kundalini awakening, you
become a super person or you become a frog.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.458
Now the human being
has to become a frog or a

00:16:00.482 --> 00:16:07.173
chicken or I don't know
what it has to become.
According to these people? Ha?

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.758
So it is quite silly, you
know, the way people have

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:12.890
written, such big books
they have written, all silly.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.530
I can assure you: when you'll get
your realization, you'll be laughing at it.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.373
It's a big joke.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.434
Everybody cannot talk
of Kundalini awakening

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.150
unless and until
you know about it.

00:16:23.173 --> 00:16:31.173
Seeker: [Unclear: We are new people. How would we know that our Kundalini is awakened?]

00:16:31.206 --> 00:16:36.845
Shri Mata ji: You see, what you will feel when,
once the Kundalini is awakened.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.840
In Sahaja Yoga, as I
said, if the instrument

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:41.339
is perfect, it
happens just like that.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.973
You see, like a very, we
say, very smooth landing.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.423
So the Kundalini
lands up very smoothly.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.610
For people who are simple, they just
do not feel anything except that they feel

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.930
absolutely relaxed.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.273
And from their hand they
feel this Chaitanya flowing,

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.625
these vibrations start flowing.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.930
Now once they get it, supposing I give
you pounds and you do not know what

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.339
is the value of pounds?
you must spend it.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:14.915
Then once you start using them,
then you realise how powerful they are.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.923
Simple things happen.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.635
First you get thoughtless awareness,
which is called as Nirvichar Samadhi.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.359
You are listening to Me, but you
become absolutely thoughtless.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.573
There is no thought-
you become blank.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:29.820
When the Kundalini crosses this, when
it crosses this, you start getting this

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.555
in the hands and the whole
thing becomes absolutely relaxed.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.973
Now after realisation, you
have to steady yourself.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.490
That is the most important
thing where we fail.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.175
Because though you are brought to the
boat, still you are just going like that,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.839
because you have
come from the wobbling system.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.655
So after that you
have to settle down.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.435
And that settling
takes some time.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:02.520
And if you could devote your time to
that settling, then you can be a very

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.875
good Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:09.460
You can give realisation to people,
just like that, moving your hands, just

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.200
like this. Children can give realisation,
this child can give realisation.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.448
She's a born realised.
Then you can make out

00:18:15.472 --> 00:18:18.023
people who are realised,
who are not realised.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.220
You can make out people who have written
the books, if they are realised

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:21.840
people or not.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.075
You can make out the temples
which are really Swayambhu, or not.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.480
All absolute questions can be answered
with Sahaja Yoga, because you start

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.006
getting these vibrations.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.575
You can ask any
question which is absolute.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.689
Even like a question
like, is there God?

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.460
Immediately the vibrations will start
flowing in the hands and you will start

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.806
feeling that cool.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.706
These are very soothing
vibrations, absolutely soothing.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.820
They soothe you completely.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:54.000
And if you put your hand on somebody
after realisation, that person also feels

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.273
that soothing like.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.473
And the whole thing
starts melting out.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:05.073
You find the whole thing melts.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:09.570
When the Kundalini rises, in some
people, it can show also, if there are

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.690
obstructions.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.850
Like if it is at the Nabhi Chakra, if
there's obstruction, you can see the

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.445
Kundalini absolutely
there on the triangular bone.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.610
But supposing at the Swadishthana
it is, then on the sides you see the

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.210
Kundalini bursting out.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.190
You can ask the person, she might
be suffering from uterus, he might be

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.456
suffering from liver
or something like that.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.930
Then if the person had a bad guru or
somebody who has misled him, the Kundalini

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.673
comes and throbs here.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.956
Throbs very badly.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.590
And when it throbs there, you can
make out that the person had a wrong guru

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.090
who has misled him.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.893
Then here you have to
awaken the guru in you.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.510
Then it comes up to this, if you have
suffering from sense of insecurity, then

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.970
also the Kundalini
can stop at this point.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.540
Here you have to
awaken the Jagdammba.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:58.240
Then you come up here, it is
the Krishna's Chakra at the back.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.218
When the Kundalini stops there,
then maybe the person has been

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:04.556
smoking or saying something; See there
are

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:10.353
many complications about it, because
there are 16,000; 16,000 Nadis attached to

00:20:10.353 --> 00:20:15.723
it, so this is a very important,
very, very important chakra.

00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:20.129
Moreover, if you have been using any
mantras then this is spoiled.

00:20:20.213 --> 00:20:21.635
Because mantra has a big 'Shastra'.

00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:27.985
You should not accept any mantras from
anyone, because nobody can give a mantra.

00:20:28.053 --> 00:20:31.190
When they give a mantra, you should
ask them, “Why are you giving me, what is

00:20:31.223 --> 00:20:36.940
wrong with me, why this
chakra, why that chakra?”

00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:40.240
They don't know
anything, I can tell you.

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:46.639
The example of this is, there was one
yogi,

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:48.823
so-called yogi, who had come to me from South Africa.

00:20:48.878 --> 00:20:51.573
He gave such horrible mantras to the
English boys there,

00:20:51.614 --> 00:20:57.290
and some of them told me like, “Inga, pinga,
tinga”, sort of things.

00:20:57.338 --> 00:21:01.490
So even an ordinary Indian can understand,
that these are all rumble-tumbles.

00:21:01.538 --> 00:21:03.140
He did not even know Sanskrit.

00:21:03.198 --> 00:21:06.878
So Mantra Vidya if you know, then you
know the whole Vidya, but Mantra Vidya

00:21:06.878 --> 00:21:11.198
can only be known after
realisation, not before that.

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.273
They have got realized!

00:21:13.318 --> 00:21:15.073
Are you getting cool feel in your hand?

00:21:15.118 --> 00:21:19.890
Aarey! just sitting they got their ascent. OK, just put your hands like this.

00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:21.918
Just put your hands like this.
All of you should get it, all of you.

00:21:21.918 --> 00:21:28.606
Now don't look at others, you have
to look at yourself for change.

00:21:28.668 --> 00:21:33.639
Close your eyes, bete,
Close your eyes, bete.

00:21:33.688 --> 00:21:39.573
Now if you can't close your eyes,
then you keep your eyes open.

00:21:39.618 --> 00:21:41.206
it’s coming, coolness is coming

00:21:41.238 --> 00:21:47.123
It has happened.

00:21:47.158 --> 00:21:49.540
Please close your eyes, please.

00:21:49.673 --> 00:21:55.773
If you have come here for
realisation, at least close your eyes.

00:21:55.828 --> 00:21:59.290
Brother close your eyes,
keep your hands towards me.

00:21:59.348 --> 00:22:03.073
close your eyes,
put your hands towards me.

00:22:03.208 --> 00:22:06.190
Must accept humbly.

00:22:06.248 --> 00:22:15.590
If you are not humble, your Kundalini is never going to ascent.

00:22:15.678 --> 00:22:18.856
Now have come to ask for a thing
 of many, many previous births

00:22:18.898 --> 00:22:24.898
You haven't got it yet. It requires a lot of humbleness for the Kundalini to rise.

00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:28.440
If humility is not there, then Kundalini
 will keep sitting there below,
it won’t rise, I am telling you.

00:22:34.998 --> 00:22:37.223
It's not a shop.

00:22:37.278 --> 00:22:42.988
You have come to yours’s mother's
place, accept it humility.

00:23:10.448 --> 00:23:12.973
Leave your mind totally light, absolutely light.

00:23:13.008 --> 00:23:15.190
Don’t put it at all anywhere,
totally light.

00:23:15.288 --> 00:23:16.748
At the most concentrate on your hands.

00:23:23.508 --> 00:23:26.183
If your body is not stable, sit openly.

00:23:26.208 --> 00:23:27.143
Open your eyes.

00:23:27.168 --> 00:23:28.063
Why your body is shaking?

00:23:28.088 --> 00:23:30.443
Have you been to any Guru?

00:23:30.468 --> 00:23:31.724
Not gone to any.

00:23:31.768 --> 00:23:32.974
Not at all.

00:23:33.028 --> 00:23:34.228
You, not you, do not open eyes.

00:23:34.308 --> 00:23:35.128
Eyes, eyes you keep closed.

00:23:35.168 --> 00:23:38.500
You people do not open eyes; you keep eyes closed.

00:23:38.548 --> 00:23:39.767
Never been there.

00:23:39.808 --> 00:23:41.017
Not to any one?

00:23:41.068 --> 00:23:42.750
It can't be.

00:23:42.808 --> 00:23:47.101
Try remembering.

00:23:47.138 --> 00:23:52.706
Read more of books.
Then what?

00:23:52.778 --> 00:23:54.056
What's the point of moving so much?

00:23:54.098 --> 00:23:55.540
Sit peacefully.

00:23:55.578 --> 00:23:57.373
There should be no moving etc. nothing.

00:23:57.418 --> 00:23:58.706
Must sit peacefully.

00:23:58.738 --> 00:24:01.187
If you cannot sit quietly for five minutes in meditation,

00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:03.787
how will Kundalini arise?

00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:10.490
Sit at peace.

00:24:10.538 --> 00:24:16.890
Must sit at peace for five minutes.

00:24:16.938 --> 00:24:19.323
Your body is moving.
Hmm?

00:24:19.378 --> 00:24:21.606
Seeker: Its moving by itself.
Shri Mata ji: Its moving by itself?

00:24:21.648 --> 00:24:23.723
You please move out.

00:24:23.768 --> 00:24:32.050
Putting his left hand towards me, bring his right hand to outside.

00:24:32.078 --> 00:24:34.950
It will be just alright.

00:24:35.008 --> 00:24:38.000
He, you don't come ever.

00:24:38.028 --> 00:24:39.123
Keep sitting where ever you are.

00:24:39.168 --> 00:24:47.156
peacefully.

00:24:49.206 --> 00:24:51.773
Getting somewhat cooling in hands?

00:24:51.828 --> 00:24:59.794
All those, who are getting this raise your hands.

00:24:59.844 --> 00:25:02.610
you didn't get it still?
Haan?

00:25:02.658 --> 00:25:04.527
little bit?
You also get it?

00:25:04.578 --> 00:25:05.938
Sahaji: feeling Sensation.
Shri Mata ji: Sensation?

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:08.040
At least remove black socks.

00:25:08.098 --> 00:25:10.006
Black socks do a little harm.

00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:10.540
We have seen.

00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:12.340
Do absorption.

00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:15.706
Are you getting any cool?
breeze in your hand?
Yogi: Yeah.

00:25:15.758 --> 00:25:18.823
In both the hands?
Yeah.

00:25:18.858 --> 00:25:19.407
All right. Yes!

00:25:19.458 --> 00:25:20.974
Just keep your hands like this.

00:25:21.018 --> 00:25:23.690
Don't bother. it will come, don't worry।

00:25:23.738 --> 00:25:29.341
Are you wearing black socks? keep them in back side.

00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:32.227
Are you wearing black socks?

00:25:32.258 --> 00:25:33.944
Socks.

00:25:33.998 --> 00:25:35.544
I think better take them out.

00:25:35.598 --> 00:25:36.910
It's better, yeah.

00:25:36.958 --> 00:25:44.890
Just let it loose to your feet.

00:25:48.428 --> 00:25:52.811
Better.

00:25:52.868 --> 00:25:55.077
Are you getting cooling in hand?

00:25:55.128 --> 00:25:56.160
Haan, slightly!

00:25:56.208 --> 00:26:01.263
Yeah, better? Just wait, It will
work out. Slightly it has begun in all.

00:26:01.288 --> 00:26:02.488
For a while sit peacefully,

00:26:02.548 --> 00:26:05.421
Comfortably.
It’s a big thing

00:26:05.448 --> 00:26:11.387
of many lifetimes.

00:26:11.418 --> 00:26:14.054
How are you?

00:26:14.118 --> 00:26:18.973
Nothing!
What?

00:26:18.998 --> 00:26:26.637
‘Arey’! he, who is sitting close to you.
Yes!

00:26:26.687 --> 00:26:29.854
Yes!
This is like that.

00:26:36.348 --> 00:26:38.187
What has he got?

00:26:38.248 --> 00:26:42.054
Catching on?

00:26:42.128 --> 00:26:46.190
Yogi: Yes

00:26:46.218 --> 00:26:47.390
Heart?

00:26:47.418 --> 00:26:48.923
No vibrations?

00:26:48.978 --> 00:26:52.590
Kundalini not rising?
Yogi: Void, Mother. Void.

00:26:52.638 --> 00:26:57.640
Void.
Also void.

00:26:57.673 --> 00:27:01.590
sahaji is saying something.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.823
Hmm.
Ok, see now you go then.

00:27:04.868 --> 00:27:06.156
We cannot help you.

00:27:06.188 --> 00:27:07.473
You go.

00:27:07.528 --> 00:27:09.106
We cannot help you.

00:27:09.148 --> 00:27:10.473
You go.

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:11.356
Its difficult work.

00:27:11.428 --> 00:27:11.956
you go.

00:27:12.008 --> 00:27:13.290
Everybody is getting disturbed by you.

00:27:13.368 --> 00:27:13.548
Ok

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:15.040
You come tomorrow.

00:27:15.068 --> 00:27:15.523
You go.

00:27:15.568 --> 00:27:17.068
Those people, who want their ascent, let them get.

00:27:17.128 --> 00:27:23.844
You go, please. Hmm.
We will be very thankful.

00:27:23.868 --> 00:27:26.167
Let him go.
Let him go.

00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:27.328
No, it’s not within his reach.

00:27:27.408 --> 00:27:28.634
He will not put his hands towards Me

00:27:28.668 --> 00:27:29.788
He will not close his eyes!

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:30.650
So, what to do?

00:27:30.688 --> 00:27:31.801
Today is meditation?

00:27:31.848 --> 00:27:33.634
In Lecture you are fine.

00:27:33.688 --> 00:27:37.300
So good.

00:27:37.348 --> 00:27:42.083
Good.

00:27:42.108 --> 00:27:43.043
Got rid of the problem.

00:27:43.068 --> 00:27:45.680
We have to tell
them out.

00:27:45.731 --> 00:27:47.083
Here is no work for stubborn people.

00:27:47.108 --> 00:27:49.564
Also you are all getting now.

00:27:49.598 --> 00:27:52.400
Right.

00:27:52.458 --> 00:27:54.417
Absolutely, its cooling only.

00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:55.801
Do it Left to right.

00:27:55.838 --> 00:27:58.113
Description is in Bible.

00:27:58.138 --> 00:28:03.754
Totally cool breeze
must come.

00:28:03.798 --> 00:28:05.337
Yes.

00:28:05.378 --> 00:28:07.337
Also, you are all getting now.

00:28:07.378 --> 00:28:10.054
Better wear your socks.

00:28:10.098 --> 00:28:15.227
Yes!

00:28:15.338 --> 00:28:20.427
All are getting it.

00:28:20.488 --> 00:28:26.604
Shri Mata ji saying something in Marathi.

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:28.923
Anybody who is coming in a sanyasi's
dress, tell them to change their dress and

00:28:28.956 --> 00:28:32.523
then come.

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:40.573
We cannot give
realisation to sanyasi's.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.409
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.343
I knew that.

00:28:45.418 --> 00:28:52.293
If he goes away,
he helps us a lot.

00:28:52.368 --> 00:28:53.860
These boys have got it now.

00:28:53.908 --> 00:28:55.476
You have got cooling, isn't it?

00:28:55.528 --> 00:28:57.506
Yours?
Alright.

00:28:57.608 --> 00:29:02.606
Now, what I would say that you
take these boys together and work out with them.

00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:03.790
Because [Siddhi-Unclear- zyada hai].

00:29:03.815 --> 00:29:05.956
Whether you people will come
 in Sahaj Yoga or not?

00:29:06.008 --> 00:29:07.906
What? Whether you will
Help us or not?

00:29:07.988 --> 00:29:08.523
What!

00:29:08.608 --> 00:29:09.440
Definitely.

00:29:09.508 --> 00:29:11.707
Here it is that thousands get their ascent, then

00:29:11.757 --> 00:29:14.457
nothing is known about any of them, as if (Unclear)। No, no!

00:29:14.508 --> 00:29:18.707
Then come again, then we do not understand how the work will get accomplished.

00:29:18.768 --> 00:29:22.474
You have to come for meditation. And
every Sunday it is done at yours?

00:29:22.528 --> 00:29:28.061
It is on every Friday. Once in a month it is (under Care-Unclear) of Subramanian ji.

00:29:28.108 --> 00:29:32.883
Once. But in your own
place, where do you live?

00:29:32.908 --> 00:29:35.594
Haan?

00:29:35.628 --> 00:29:37.974
R.K. Puram, South Delhi.

00:29:38.024 --> 00:29:43.724
Yes, in South Delhi someone is living or not?
Yes?

00:29:43.768 --> 00:29:48.008
R.K., In R.K. Puram, Hussain
Sahab is there, you take address from him.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.367
Ok.

00:29:50.408 --> 00:29:52.767
Alright! But this is near to you also,

00:29:52.792 --> 00:29:56.603
then you are young people; you people
unite and start it. Do you understand?

00:29:56.628 --> 00:30:00.220
This is the work that must be
done collectively.

00:30:00.288 --> 00:30:01.843
This is a quite big an activity.

00:30:01.868 --> 00:30:03.883
It brings a larger collective consciousness.

00:30:03.908 --> 00:30:06.363
And this establishes the inner yoga.

00:30:06.428 --> 00:30:08.496
So much love gets increased among yourselves.

00:30:08.548 --> 00:30:10.283
We have to do it today.

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.056
The rest all are wasteful schemes.

00:30:12.108 --> 00:30:14.343
Nothing-doing, no scheme is going to benefit.

00:30:14.388 --> 00:30:17.743
And this is the responsibility of you, young people

00:30:17.788 --> 00:30:21.120
now to learn it as to how to give realization and what to do, how to do?

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.961
You may like it or not.
What?

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.774
Done?
Yours?

00:30:25.808 --> 00:30:29.941
Were you saying that, no?
You are already there.

00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:33.794
What is your position? Ok.

00:30:33.821 --> 00:30:35.114
Did you get?

00:30:35.168 --> 00:30:39.301
Anybody from there?
You are getting 'beta'?

00:30:39.348 --> 00:30:43.847
Right hand? Ok, put
your left hand on your liver.

00:30:43.888 --> 00:30:47.188
Liver. Just tell them. Ok.

00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:48.887
Yes! here only, that's all.

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:51.447
What about you?

00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:52.660
Where?

00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:56.383
and on the left.

00:30:56.408 --> 00:31:01.490
Ok keep your hand on your heart, right hand.

00:31:01.528 --> 00:31:03.916
Ok, what about those 'Chnki Mn', standing outside.

00:31:03.948 --> 00:31:07.863
Beti! yours is alright now?

00:31:07.898 --> 00:31:10.416
Coming?
Come.

00:31:10.458 --> 00:31:13.013
Stand here and see.

00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:14.149
Just see Ram what’s position,
is it happening.

00:31:14.178 --> 00:31:15.533
Stand here.

00:31:15.558 --> 00:31:16.353
In ‘Chirkhi.’

00:31:16.378 --> 00:31:19.783
Just see.

00:31:19.828 --> 00:31:21.149
All got ascent.

00:31:21.176 --> 00:31:23.083
100 % result.

00:31:23.108 --> 00:31:24.936
You are for the first time?

00:31:24.968 --> 00:31:26.110
See how about him?

00:31:26.148 --> 00:31:31.827
Devde Bagga!

00:31:35.578 --> 00:31:36.578
Did they get realized,

00:31:36.638 --> 00:31:38.124
Ganesh and Jyoti?

00:31:38.158 --> 00:31:44.150
He's got vibration.

00:31:44.188 --> 00:31:46.003
Yours’s is done? Getting it, cooling is coming. Cool?

00:31:46.028 --> 00:31:47.814
Getting cool?

00:31:47.854 --> 00:31:50.603
Haan?
Yogi: Mother his finger is sweating.

00:31:50.628 --> 00:31:53.321
Which one, right?

00:31:53.388 --> 00:31:55.083
All the fingers?
Yogi: Fingers.

00:31:55.108 --> 00:31:56.328
You didn't go to some Guru.

00:31:56.488 --> 00:31:57.096
Ever.

00:31:57.128 --> 00:31:58.243
Sure.

00:31:58.288 --> 00:32:01.383
Do keep any photo of Stya Sayin Baba etc. in your home?

00:32:01.408 --> 00:32:02.123
What?

00:32:02.168 --> 00:32:05.063
Think if you have photo of any such souls 'Bhuts'.

00:32:05.088 --> 00:32:07.323
Yes?
It comes with that also.

00:32:07.348 --> 00:32:08.468
Ok, shake off your hand.

00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:12.363
If it is kept somewhere, tell. Useless people.

00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:20.374
somewhere taking out Diamond, somewhere Topaz. Let it be there.

00:32:20.414 --> 00:32:24.709
Are you getting it?
What?

00:32:24.738 --> 00:32:32.533
Only in one? And in the
rest you are not getting?

00:32:32.558 --> 00:32:35.571
Seeker: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: All right, keep it for a while,
we'll see you again. Ok?

00:32:35.598 --> 00:32:40.130
What about you?
Seeker: [Inaudible]

00:32:40.168 --> 00:32:41.428
Shri Mataji: See, you have liver trouble.

00:32:41.508 --> 00:32:42.568
We'll work it out, all right?

00:32:42.628 --> 00:32:46.274
We have to often clean that out first.

00:32:46.308 --> 00:32:50.268
Chakra. If you give it too much of thinking
or if thinking becomes your disease, which

00:32:50.268 --> 00:32:51.348
is a modern thing. You see,
everybody starts thinking.

00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:53.983
Once you start thinking, you cannot stop your thinking.

00:32:54.008 --> 00:32:56.303
Then also liver gets spoilt.

00:32:56.328 --> 00:33:00.234
But the worst enemy
of liver is alcohol.

00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:02.423
Absolutely, it's
the worst enemy.

00:33:02.448 --> 00:33:06.428
I mean, if you want to die,
best thing is to go to a pub, take

00:33:06.428 --> 00:33:08.373
drinks and die.

00:33:08.428 --> 00:33:10.273
It's like buying your death.

00:33:10.308 --> 00:33:12.623
Like calling a bull,
‘come and hit me.

00:33:12.648 --> 00:33:13.923
I will give you my money.’

00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:15.156
It is something like that.

00:33:15.208 --> 00:33:17.290
It's absolutely self-destroying.

00:33:17.348 --> 00:33:21.290
And only after realisation,
you are so relaxed.

00:33:21.328 --> 00:33:28.054
And you enjoy your company so
much that it is very easy to give up.

00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:33.048
Now the another thing that is very
important in this case is our eyes are very

00:33:33.048 --> 00:33:38.971
important, which play a very big
part in the Swadhishthana movement.

00:33:39.008 --> 00:33:43.988
Now those people who move their eyes
too much here and there. You see, I don't

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:46.428
know, this is a modern
style also, too much to move.

00:33:46.488 --> 00:33:48.020
Everything they
must see, like that

00:33:48.068 --> 00:33:49.637
they're going on, mad people.

00:33:49.688 --> 00:33:51.448
I don't know what is
there to see like that, you see.

00:33:51.448 --> 00:33:56.008
Actually in former days, when we were
young, we were told
to see

00:33:56.008 --> 00:33:59.397
the Mother Earth all the time, not to raise
your eyes higher than that.

00:33:59.428 --> 00:34:02.581
The reason is the Mother
Earth soothes your eyes.

00:34:02.608 --> 00:34:07.228
But if you go on moving your eyes too
much, the attention is moving,

00:34:07.228 --> 00:34:08.506
wobbling all the time.

00:34:08.548 --> 00:34:12.373
Now the attention
is sustained by liver.

00:34:12.408 --> 00:34:16.006
If your liver is not all right,
your attention cannot be all right.

00:34:16.048 --> 00:34:19.368
So those people who have a habit, you
see, sometimes they'll see through the

00:34:19.368 --> 00:34:21.939
back of their eyes,
go from here to there.

00:34:21.968 --> 00:34:25.040
They think they're doing something
great by doing these things.

00:34:25.108 --> 00:34:27.756
Such people can
never have good livers.

00:34:27.788 --> 00:34:30.823
So to keep a good liver,
keep your eyes down.

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:32.673
Don't give them too much work.

00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:37.688
We are giving too much work to our
eyes and that's how it is keeping our

00:34:37.688 --> 00:34:39.456
attention all the
time wobbled out.

00:34:39.488 --> 00:34:44.323
And if your attention is out,
then you can never feel happy.

00:34:44.388 --> 00:34:47.468
So the liver sustains
the attention.

00:34:47.468 --> 00:34:52.348
And for you to be best Sahaja
Yogi is to put your eyes down on the

00:34:52.348 --> 00:34:57.568
Mother Earth, walk with less raising
of your eyes. Respect your eyes.

00:34:58.088 --> 00:35:01.828
You're not to waste your eyes on
all the time anybody coming up here.

00:35:01.928 --> 00:35:06.873
I've seen even in meditation
people can't keep their eyes straight.

00:35:06.928 --> 00:35:11.828
You have to keep your eyes all the time
in a mood that you're enjoying yourself

00:35:11.828 --> 00:35:15.968
and not enjoying others,
but just enjoying yourself.

00:35:15.968 --> 00:35:17.643
You cannot enjoy others.

00:35:17.668 --> 00:35:21.856
You have to enjoy yourself to
enjoy somebody else's vibrations.

00:35:21.888 --> 00:35:27.123
You can only enjoy others through
their vibrations, not through their seeing.

00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:31.628
And because of this, once you have this
kind of a habit, then your liver always

00:35:31.628 --> 00:35:33.106
gets into it.

00:35:33.148 --> 00:35:37.390
Then you curse yourself, you do
all kinds of things, there's no good.

00:35:37.431 --> 00:35:41.643
Just tell yourself, “Oh! my
eye on the Mother Earth.”

00:35:41.668 --> 00:35:49.639
She sustains, she takes away
all your problems and everything.

00:35:51.308 --> 00:35:58.608
So liver, I've told you today, and the
same thing applies to other organs,

00:35:58.657 --> 00:36:00.874
which I will tell you tomorrow.

00:36:00.908 --> 00:36:04.788
One, every day I'm going to tell
you about one organ- how to keep it all

00:36:04.788 --> 00:36:07.290
right.

00:36:07.324 --> 00:36:13.514
Any other question?
Yogini: What about heart trouble?

00:36:13.548 --> 00:36:14.914
Shri Mataji: Heart trouble.

00:36:14.968 --> 00:36:19.848
Now heart trouble comes just as a
warning because nature wants you to stop

00:36:19.848 --> 00:36:21.580
being silly.
That's it.

00:36:21.628 --> 00:36:23.714
Simple.

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:26.190
Absolutely it is
so simple as that.

00:36:26.248 --> 00:36:30.990
Heart is the
temple of your Spirit.

00:36:31.048 --> 00:36:34.248
If you pay attention
to anything else too

00:36:34.272 --> 00:36:37.473
much than the Spirit,
you get a heart attack.

00:36:37.508 --> 00:36:42.590
Because the right hand side, Pingla Naddi
and all, if you are using too much.

00:36:42.641 --> 00:36:44.740
What's happening?
Yogini: Head is hot.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.957
Shri Mataji: Head is getting hot!

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.273
Have you come first time?

00:36:51.307 --> 00:36:53.956
What?

00:36:54.007 --> 00:36:55.007
Yes, or no?

00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:17.073
TALK IN MARATHI!

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.356
Yes! Alright!

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.390
Yes!

00:37:20.423 --> 00:37:34.789
TALK IN MARATHI!

00:37:34.823 --> 00:37:36.473
You asked about what? Heart!

00:37:36.523 --> 00:37:38.963
In Heart attack

00:37:38.988 --> 00:37:44.008
if you have used your right side, which
is called as the Pingala Nadi, which is

00:37:44.008 --> 00:37:45.088
the right side sympathetic.

00:37:45.088 --> 00:37:47.754
The left hand side, doctors do not
differentiate between the left and right,

00:37:47.788 --> 00:37:49.704
but they are two
different things altogether.

00:37:49.748 --> 00:37:53.543
The one that is on the right hand
side caters for your mental activity.

00:37:53.568 --> 00:37:57.434
If you are doing too much mental activity
or physical activity, the left hand,

00:37:57.488 --> 00:38:00.000
just see the nature,
how beautiful it is,

00:38:00.028 --> 00:38:05.150
The heart, which is not responsible
for your thinking at all, stops

00:38:05.208 --> 00:38:12.373
Or it gives you a push, or it
sort of- suddenly collapses.

00:38:12.408 --> 00:38:15.939
Or it gives you a
Warning: you get a pain.

00:38:15.988 --> 00:38:21.056
On the contrary, if you are using your left
side, see, left side is for your emotions.

00:38:21.108 --> 00:38:26.068
If you are too much emotionally built
up, people are very emotional, some of

00:38:26.068 --> 00:38:28.523
them, all the time
crying, weeping, all that.

00:38:28.568 --> 00:38:31.039
Such people, their
brain goes out.

00:38:31.068 --> 00:38:32.489
See the combination:

00:38:32.568 --> 00:38:35.956
Brain has nothing to do with your
emotion, but the brain goes out.

00:38:36.008 --> 00:38:38.989
See the balance! How
nature has built you up.

00:38:39.028 --> 00:38:41.373
So the heart says,
“Now it's too much.”

00:38:41.448 --> 00:38:46.256
A person who's running too much
after position, he gets a heart attack.

00:38:46.288 --> 00:38:49.656
A person who's running too much
after money, he gets a heart attack.

00:38:49.688 --> 00:38:53.788
A person who runs too much after
thinking that he's doing a great job, it is

00:38:53.788 --> 00:38:55.973
his responsibility, this thing.

00:38:56.028 --> 00:39:00.128
So the spirit- the responsibility
is that of the spirit, is not of yours.

00:39:00.228 --> 00:39:01.490
So you get a heart attack.

00:39:01.528 --> 00:39:05.728
If you overdo anything, physically
or mentally, the heart is the one that

00:39:05.728 --> 00:39:06.590
checks you.

00:39:06.628 --> 00:39:09.656
It's very simple
to get rid of it.

00:39:09.688 --> 00:39:12.473
If you have to raise your
left, put it to the right.

00:39:12.548 --> 00:39:14.023
Raise your left,
put it to the right.

00:39:14.088 --> 00:39:16.439
Twenty-one times every
day you should do it.

00:39:16.488 --> 00:39:20.248
Immediately you'll find that your,
by raising your left, you are raising

00:39:20.248 --> 00:39:22.820
your superego,
reducing your ego.

00:39:22.848 --> 00:39:25.254
And ego and superego, both
of them come down like that.

00:39:25.308 --> 00:39:26.937
And then the Kundalini
can open it up.

00:39:26.968 --> 00:39:31.228
Otherwise, in the conditions, when the
people are working very hard, the ego is

00:39:31.228 --> 00:39:32.488
actually on the
left-hand side though.
