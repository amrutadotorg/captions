01:50.960 --> 01:52.720
Just sit down.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.920
Ask them to sit down on the ground. Please.

01:56.120 --> 02:00.402
You, two ladies, sit down because they cannot see from the back.

02:52.040 --> 02:57.520
Today you all have gathered here

02:58.400 --> 03:01.760
to worship Me as your Guru.

03:07.360 --> 03:12.360
I must say that I lack many qualities

03:12.560 --> 03:15.800
that a guru should have,

03:16.960 --> 03:22.720
in the sense I cannot be strict with you,

03:23.800 --> 03:26.720
I cannot be stern with you,

03:27.120 --> 03:34.360
and I really don’t know how to punish you for doing wrong things.

03:37.440 --> 03:42.520
This may be because, normally I think

03:42.720 --> 03:49.760
the gurus have problems with their disciples,

03:50.240 --> 03:54.280
who are mostly not realized souls.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.600
As they are not realized souls,

03:57.800 --> 04:03.600
the gurus find it difficult to communicate

04:04.400 --> 04:07.320
or talk to them

04:09.960 --> 04:15.440
about the subtle problems that they have.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.840
I know of many gurus

04:23.880 --> 04:26.160
even in modern times

04:26.760 --> 04:33.640
who’ve been really very, very strict.

04:36.440 --> 04:40.520
And also they told Me

04:41.240 --> 04:46.360
that they have achieved their realization

04:47.320 --> 04:50.120
by working very hard

04:50.600 --> 04:57.200
and by suffering under the strictness of the gurus.

05:02.080 --> 05:09.840
Sometimes I was really filled with great compassion for such disciples

05:10.800 --> 05:14.240
who haven't yet received their realization.

05:14.720 --> 05:20.280
They had gurus who were really realized souls

05:20.880 --> 05:25.720
and they never had their realization,

05:26.320 --> 05:32.360
and the guru was extremely strict with them.

05:34.480 --> 05:41.720
There was one gentleman I met in Kolhapur,

05:42.880 --> 05:47.560
and he got realization in one minute.

05:48.440 --> 05:53.520
So he told Me that his guru had "told me

05:54.800 --> 06:01.960
to go for fast every month at least for eight days."

06:02.680 --> 06:05.440
All right. "Then he asked me

06:05.640 --> 06:09.800
to build a temple of Dattatreya in his village."

06:11.400 --> 06:16.400
And every day he must go and worship Dattatreya

06:17.520 --> 06:21.160
in the morning time and in the evening time.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.560
He spent so much money,

06:25.880 --> 06:28.960
and still he didn't get realization.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.160
"And while You hardly took two minutes to give me realization, Mother.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.600
What is this?

06:35.840 --> 06:39.400
How You have been so gracious to me?"

06:43.880 --> 06:46.840
So, I didn't know what to answer him

06:47.080 --> 06:49.000
I didn't want to talk against his guru

06:49.200 --> 06:52.720
because I know he is a realized soul.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.840
Actually, most of these gurus

07:02.760 --> 07:05.760
and incarnations

07:07.960 --> 07:11.760
were very helpless with human beings.

07:12.520 --> 07:19.200
Perhaps they didn't have such beautiful disciples as I have.

07:20.280 --> 07:26.680
Perhaps at this time all the good people

07:27.160 --> 07:31.800
who were seeking Divinity are born,

07:32.320 --> 07:39.400
and they are here as Sahaja yogis.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.640
I never had to work very hard on them.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.680
Of course once in a while you do get a person

07:49.080 --> 07:53.640
who tries to trouble us, or who tries to create problems.

07:55.400 --> 08:01.320
But modern times are so special, I think,

08:01.720 --> 08:08.360
that it's very easy to give realization to people.

08:12.040 --> 08:18.000
At the time of Moses, He had made laws

08:18.280 --> 08:24.720
because of the decadent society of the Jews at that time.

08:25.240 --> 08:32.240
And that one was very hard, very, very hard,

08:32.600 --> 08:36.600
which we know today as shariat –

08:36.800 --> 08:40.280
was taken over by the Muslims.

08:41.040 --> 08:47.280
And even now the punishments according to so-called Koran

08:47.480 --> 08:50.720
are so hard that you can't believe it.

08:50.960 --> 08:58.480
And most of the pressure of all their dharmic laws are on the women.

09:01.200 --> 09:07.040
Whatever it is, even in the Bible if you read Christ,

09:07.880 --> 09:12.400
He has said that

09:12.600 --> 09:17.440
all those Ten Commandments are nothing,

09:18.800 --> 09:21.440
you have to go beyond them.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.120
And He says if your one eye is mischievous,

09:26.520 --> 09:29.400
is committing sin, take it out.

09:30.160 --> 09:34.280
What's the use of the whole body getting contaminated by that?

09:34.720 --> 09:41.760
Or if your one arm is doing something that is wrong,

09:43.520 --> 09:45.960
you better remove it.

09:46.560 --> 09:51.520
Because of one arm, the whole body will suffer.

09:52.320 --> 09:57.960
He said that, it is said that you should not be adulterous.

09:58.200 --> 10:04.240
But I would say that you should not have eyes

10:05.040 --> 10:09.320
in which for any woman you have desire-

10:09.520 --> 10:12.040
you have committed the great sin;

10:12.280 --> 10:15.200
and you'll all go to hell, all those people who will do it.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.960
So you should not have adulterous eyes.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.400
Another thing He has said,

10:24.840 --> 10:27.880
that if somebody slaps you on one face,

10:28.440 --> 10:37.040
you should turn another cheek towards that person.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.640
When I knew about these laws I said,

10:43.840 --> 10:46.920
How can you have such people in this world?

10:47.320 --> 10:49.800
It's a very subtle thing.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.840
And the last of all which was very, very good was

10:54.040 --> 10:57.440
that you should be righteous,

10:58.160 --> 11:04.120
righteous more than all the scribes and all the Pharisees

11:04.320 --> 11:06.200
– means the priest and all this with the –

11:06.400 --> 11:09.640
you have to be much more righteous than them.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.320
I mean, in early age when I read it I thought,

11:14.520 --> 11:17.440
where can you find such people

11:17.960 --> 11:24.040
who can be called anywhere near Christ's description?

11:24.440 --> 11:29.320
It was inconceivable at that time.

11:30.080 --> 11:36.760
India is one place as I told you, people are dharmic by their own,

11:37.080 --> 11:39.920
we can say,

11:40.120 --> 11:46.840
their own genes you can call them,

11:47.120 --> 11:53.360
or you can say they are extremely dharmic because of traditions -

11:54.360 --> 11:55.680
brought up like that.

11:55.920 --> 12:01.120
In My time, in the South India and Maharashtra,

12:02.080 --> 12:05.280
I think we were very dharmic family,

12:05.560 --> 12:09.040
and it was very dharmic atmosphere.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.840
Still,

12:12.080 --> 12:18.440
these things that Christ has described was not there.

12:18.920 --> 12:24.200
For example, anger was regarded as a great asset.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.720
People used to boast, “I am very angry with that person!”

12:26.920 --> 12:28.120
they used to say.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.240
Very common.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.040
Of course I don't think in India anybody can say

12:35.240 --> 12:38.920
“I hate you” because is regarded something sinful and stupid,

12:39.320 --> 12:43.880
because to hate somebody is being adharmic.

12:44.120 --> 12:49.400
But of course they did say so many things

12:49.920 --> 12:56.960
that were not at all permissible by the laws of Christ.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.760
And then came Mohammed Sahib,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.560
who just found that nothing works out.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.520
So I think they adopted shariat - but not Mohammed Sahib -

13:12.720 --> 13:16.320
but they had adopted already the shariat.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.280
He accepted.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.520
He said, “All right, this shariat can be worked out."

13:22.720 --> 13:26.720
But it is so inhuman and has no balance,

13:26.920 --> 13:33.160
because only the women have to suffer; no, nothing to men.

13:33.680 --> 13:38.640
If a woman did adultery then she was punished, but not the man.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.840
Even, I don't know what is the law here,

13:42.040 --> 13:46.880
but in India if a woman who is married does adultery,

13:47.080 --> 13:49.800
such a man has to be punished,

13:50.080 --> 13:55.920
but if the married man does adultery there is no punishment.

13:56.960 --> 14:05.360
All these things, I know, cannot be forced on anyone.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.760
Whatever Christ must have said,

14:07.960 --> 14:11.800
He must have said in His own meditative mood.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.840
He was surrounded by people

14:15.040 --> 14:18.320
who tried to kill Him, and they killed Him ultimately.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.200
And the kind of people they were,

14:22.400 --> 14:25.760
specially at that time the Romans

14:26.720 --> 14:29.160
– extremely cruel.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.920
So how can He say that if you,

14:34.200 --> 14:38.960
somebody slaps you on one cheek, you turn another cheek to that person?

14:39.240 --> 14:44.240
Very angry, hot-tempered people were there.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.720
Krishna, of course, said it very clearly

14:50.040 --> 14:53.640
that “krodhat bhijayati sammoha” – is krodh is the worst thing,

14:53.840 --> 14:56.960
anger is the worst sin according to Him,

14:57.200 --> 15:02.280
from - only from anger everything comes out.

15:03.320 --> 15:07.120
But He didn't say how the anger comes in.

15:07.640 --> 15:13.800
He didn't talk about it that the source of anger was your liver,

15:14.440 --> 15:16.400
and also your upbringing.

15:16.720 --> 15:22.640
These two things give you horrible anger.

15:23.800 --> 15:28.760
Unless and until you witness yourself,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.400
your realization has no meaning.

15:32.880 --> 15:38.240
You should separate yourself from yourself,

15:38.440 --> 15:44.440
and see for yourself what is really wrong with you.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.920
Now supposing somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

15:49.200 --> 15:53.960
instead of taking pride in it

15:54.440 --> 15:59.440
or using that temper to control others,

15:59.840 --> 16:03.040
he should try to control himself.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.040
How?

16:05.360 --> 16:08.160
First is the krodha.

16:08.480 --> 16:13.160
Anybody who wants to be a saint should know

16:13.480 --> 16:19.360
that anger, this krodha, should have no place.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.320
And how do you do it?

16:22.640 --> 16:27.080
You first of all witness yourself how you behave.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.560
For example,

16:29.760 --> 16:34.400
I would say artificially you become angry, artificially,

16:35.040 --> 16:36.800
and stand before the mirror.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
See your face, how you look like.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.960
You'll be surprised,

16:42.160 --> 16:45.240
looks like a face of a monkey or a tiger,

16:45.440 --> 16:50.720
or I don't know what animal you must have been in last life.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.160
And then you are amazed

16:54.360 --> 16:58.480
that you are still carrying the traces of that previous life

16:58.680 --> 17:02.120
that was whatever was the animal.

17:02.680 --> 17:08.840
Then the second thing would be, take out the anger upon yourself.

17:09.080 --> 17:15.440
As we have in Sahaja Yoga, we write down our own names and beat it.

17:16.760 --> 17:23.680
But it is, should be that if you get angry with yourself,

17:24.400 --> 17:26.960
then you will see

17:27.320 --> 17:33.160
that you have won over your anger.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.880
Because angry people only torture others,

17:38.080 --> 17:42.040
they don't torture themselves. Of course sometimes they feel bad,

17:42.240 --> 17:44.240
later on they feel “I should not have done this,”

17:44.440 --> 17:47.600
they develop a left Vishuddhi.

17:48.760 --> 17:55.760
But, mainly if you start getting angry with yourself –

17:56.640 --> 17:59.880
“Why should I have done this? Why did I do this?"

18:00.120 --> 18:03.480
"Why should I get tempted to this?” –

18:03.800 --> 18:08.680
you'll be surprised, your temper will go down.

18:09.280 --> 18:14.680
And also physically you should see you have a liver problem.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.040
With that you just face yourself

18:18.240 --> 18:21.000
and tell that “I’m going to get rid of this liver problem.

18:21.200 --> 18:27.960
How dare it become my enemy

18:28.920 --> 18:33.320
and stop my ascent in spirituality.”

18:33.880 --> 18:36.960
So the first, the witness state has to be developed.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.840
For a Sahaja yogi is very important to develop a witness state.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.440
But normally what happens

18:44.840 --> 18:50.400
that Sahaja yogis develop a witness state for others.

18:51.680 --> 18:55.400
Now you know in Sahaja Yoga the door is open to everyone;

18:55.920 --> 18:59.200
and some mad people also walk in,

18:59.560 --> 19:02.480
some funny people also walk in,

19:03.040 --> 19:06.320
some very bad-charactered people also walk in,

19:06.520 --> 19:09.200
all kinds of things happen.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.680
So now you should see,

19:13.920 --> 19:19.960
what are you worried about?

19:21.480 --> 19:25.800
Are you worried about people who have problems,

19:26.640 --> 19:32.080
who are no good, for whom you cannot say that they'll be Sahaja yogis;

19:32.360 --> 19:39.080
or you are enjoying the people who have got Sahaja Yoga?

19:41.080 --> 19:44.760
This temper sometimes has made people really mad, I tell you,

19:45.040 --> 19:48.080
can go into your head and can make you mad;

19:48.280 --> 19:53.200
and we have some mad people in Sahaja Yoga, we have still.

19:53.600 --> 19:59.040
But they have become so mad that now they are no more angry,

19:59.240 --> 20:05.200
they are no more troublesome, they are just mad, that's all.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.520
For such people you shouldn't worry.

20:10.400 --> 20:17.400
There's no need to witness others – witness yourself.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.600
And I sometimes feel

20:22.000 --> 20:27.760
that anger comes through too much austerity,

20:28.960 --> 20:32.440
too much of extreme nature also.

20:33.120 --> 20:38.680
Some Sahaja yogis are extremely austere,

20:39.920 --> 20:44.520
austere about everything. It's maddening.

20:44.760 --> 20:50.560
In Sahaja Yoga there is, everything is Sahaj, it’s spontaneous.

20:50.760 --> 20:55.960
You are not to be austere. You should not be particular.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.920
Now, I said now it's not better,

20:58.120 --> 21:03.000
not to wear a black sari or something, if I say so –

21:03.480 --> 21:07.680
then it doesn't become a sentence from Brahma!

21:08.040 --> 21:12.160
Supposing then somebody is wearing a black sari and coming,

21:12.520 --> 21:15.040
you will all run away from that person –

21:15.320 --> 21:18.440
or black clothes. It's not that.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.760
You are gurus yourself;

21:22.080 --> 21:25.680
why should you be afraid of any kind of person who comes to you,

21:25.880 --> 21:29.880
whether it is black, white, or any type?

21:30.400 --> 21:37.120
Why should you have any fear?  The another side of temper is fear.

21:37.720 --> 21:42.440
A man who is hot-tempered always have fear

21:42.640 --> 21:46.520
because he sees himself in others.

21:46.720 --> 21:53.360
He sees that "another person also must be having the same kind of temper,

21:53.560 --> 21:59.720
and he'll attack me," so he's always on the protective.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.640
In a Sahaj manner

22:04.520 --> 22:11.160
what we do is to live without fear.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.200
It's said that wages of sin is fear,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.760
but I would say wages of anger.

22:19.960 --> 22:24.400
Those people who were very aggressive, say for example,

22:24.960 --> 22:29.320
develop frights, all kinds of frights.

22:29.520 --> 22:33.080
Those countries who have invaded other countries

22:33.320 --> 22:36.240
and rule other countries,

22:36.440 --> 22:44.160
and have got the experience of their ego, of their anger,

22:44.360 --> 22:48.520
become extremely frightened people.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.600
Specially the soldiers

22:50.800 --> 22:54.600
who go on the war, kill so many people and come back,

22:54.800 --> 22:56.440
and they are frightened.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.760
I asked one of them in America, I said, “What are you frightened of?”

23:00.960 --> 23:03.160
He said, “I feel that I have killed so many people,

23:03.360 --> 23:05.160
now so many will kill me.”

23:05.360 --> 23:07.280
But I said, “Why do you think like that?"

23:07.480 --> 23:09.280
"Why should anybody kill you?”

23:09.520 --> 23:13.600
He says, “Because, why did I kill others?"

23:13.800 --> 23:18.080
"Why did I kill others? Because I killed others,

23:18.280 --> 23:22.960
so anybody can kill me, isn’t it, without rhyme and reason.”

23:23.400 --> 23:27.120
Logically I agreed. But his fear was so much

23:27.440 --> 23:29.520
that when he came in My presence he was just shaking,

23:29.720 --> 23:33.440
the whole body was shaking with fear.

23:33.840 --> 23:39.440
So, whatever aggression we do boomerangs on us,

23:39.640 --> 23:44.680
and we become very frightened about everything.

23:45.600 --> 23:50.400
In Sahaj you witness yourself as a separate identity.

23:50.720 --> 23:55.840
All your past is finished, gone, you are not bothered,

23:56.720 --> 24:03.480
and you remain in a state which is fearless.

24:05.400 --> 24:10.320
This state has to be achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

24:10.840 --> 24:16.480
Very easy, once you know that you are protected you'll have no fear,

24:16.680 --> 24:22.120
and as you'll have no fear you will not have also temper.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.000
It works vice versa sometimes.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.040
It's a very common thing I have seen,

24:28.400 --> 24:33.920
a very aggressive person will be described by a psychologist

24:34.160 --> 24:37.400
as a man of insecurity.

24:38.200 --> 24:42.160
It's nice to say that, but it's not true.

24:42.360 --> 24:48.160
He makes everybody insecured, then how can he be insecure?

24:49.360 --> 24:53.080
If another person feels insecure with that person,

24:53.280 --> 24:56.680
that means this man is not insecured,

24:56.960 --> 25:00.280
but he is over-secured.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.200
If you tell him that, then only he will improve.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.440
But if you say, “You have insecurity,”

25:06.640 --> 25:09.440
then he thinks, “Yes, my condition is pitiable."

25:09.680 --> 25:11.440
"Even if I kill somebody is all right,

25:11.640 --> 25:14.960
because my condition is pitiable.”

25:15.720 --> 25:19.520
Such arguments work out

25:19.720 --> 25:25.760
in such a manner, that you become convinced about yourself.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.640
But if you see as a witness

25:29.880 --> 25:35.240
you see, “What have I done so far?"

25:36.120 --> 25:41.320
"Have I been able to conquer myself?”

25:42.240 --> 25:46.680
Sahaja Yoga is not to conquer others or to control others,

25:46.880 --> 25:50.440
but to conquer yourself.

25:50.680 --> 25:54.160
If you have not done that, you can be self-certified -

25:54.400 --> 25:56.720
“Oh, I have been a Sahaja yogi, I have been so great,

25:56.920 --> 26:00.240
I have been this, I am -”  that makes no difference.

26:00.600 --> 26:04.920
Have you completely transformed yourself, changed yourself,

26:05.120 --> 26:11.560
and now in your presence do people feel secured?

26:14.720 --> 26:18.360
If they feel insecure, then something wrong with you.

26:18.560 --> 26:22.560
Or if you feel insecure, also there’s something wrong with you.

26:23.080 --> 26:28.280
Now this excuse to give, that “Mother, I am insecure” –

26:29.400 --> 26:33.960
then you are not a Sahaja yogi, as simple as that.

26:34.920 --> 26:39.640
Giving explanation like that shows you are not even a Sahaja yogi.

26:39.880 --> 26:43.960
So now to become the guru, first of all,

26:44.240 --> 26:49.520
you should have a great sense of forgiveness.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.560
So much so like Buddha's.

26:53.840 --> 26:57.200
Once Buddha was giving a lecture in a village

26:57.960 --> 27:02.160
and suddenly somebody came in and started abusing Him,

27:02.440 --> 27:05.840
saying all kinds of things and all that.

27:07.240 --> 27:10.800
Then somebody told him, “What are you doing?

27:11.080 --> 27:15.440
He is Buddha, the one who's Enlightened One.  He’s trying to help us

27:15.640 --> 27:19.800
to become good, and you came and shouted at Him?”

27:21.200 --> 27:23.920
So he was repentant.

27:24.200 --> 27:29.200
He went to see Buddha, but Buddha had gone to another village.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.440
So he went to another village, second day,

27:32.680 --> 27:36.600
and he went and fell at the feet of Lord Buddha.

27:37.040 --> 27:42.920
Lord Buddha said, “What's the matter?" "Why are you falling at My feet?”

27:43.280 --> 27:46.520
He said, “Sir, I must say

27:46.720 --> 27:50.360
that I was, really I didn't know You were the Enlightened One.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.040
I just shouted at You, said things, I don't know what happened to me.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.280
So please forgive me.”

27:56.480 --> 27:58.760
He said, “When did you say this to Me?”

27:58.960 --> 28:02.600
“Yesterday.” “Where?”  “In such place.”

28:03.040 --> 28:08.680
He said, “Yesterday is finished now."  "What is there to forgive?”

28:11.840 --> 28:16.600
Now, he came begging of His forgiveness, repenting.

28:16.800 --> 28:21.920
Immediately He said, “Yesterday is over.”

28:23.360 --> 28:29.760
That is one of the greatest qualities Sahaja yogis should have.

28:31.520 --> 28:38.080
To call yourself a guru you must also have maturity.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.840
And the maturity part is sometimes very -

28:42.040 --> 28:48.240
Like yesterday in the drama. I was surprised when the -

28:48.520 --> 28:51.040
it took some time, some people came in, went.

28:51.240 --> 28:57.200
They were giggling just like children. It shows no maturity, no respect.

28:57.680 --> 29:02.680
Hah, anything laughable is there of course one can laugh,

29:02.920 --> 29:07.040
or any enjoyment is there - but shows such childishness.

29:07.240 --> 29:12.160
They are doing some drama, making fun of them.

29:14.160 --> 29:18.880
Very common with Sahaja yogis I have seen, specially ladies.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.560
They laugh at things where they should never laugh.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.840
I am sitting there

29:26.840 --> 29:29.880
and you are watching something,

29:30.120 --> 29:33.160
what is there to laugh?

29:34.760 --> 29:38.120
Shows complete immaturity!

29:39.120 --> 29:42.440
Another thing I have seen is in small, small things,

29:42.680 --> 29:47.480
specially in money matters, it’s very funny. I have to tell you this:

29:47.680 --> 29:51.720
Turkish people, our Sahaja yogis have no money,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.240
everything was stolen away from them.

29:54.440 --> 29:57.360
So I said, “All right, you send some shirts here

29:57.800 --> 29:59.480
and we'll sell those shirts,

29:59.680 --> 30:04.680
and extra money you can take it,” because they would not take money from Me.

30:05.040 --> 30:09.280
So when they sent the shirt here, it was - they said that “Mother,

30:09.480 --> 30:10.520
I don't know marketing,"

30:10.720 --> 30:13.840
they said, “Mother, it should be twenty-one dollars, twenty-two dollars.”

30:14.080 --> 30:17.280
Many of them said it is expensive.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.840
Then I said, “All right, collect money from everyone,

30:22.040 --> 30:24.720
twenty-two dollars each without giving any shirt,

30:24.920 --> 30:27.920
finished – for Turkey.”

30:30.320 --> 30:35.120
But a false guru takes money from you, you don't mind.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.520
Sahaja Yoga is free of course,

30:40.120 --> 30:43.560
no doubt. Sahaja Yoga is free.

30:44.320 --> 30:47.640
But you have to contribute.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.520
How are we to run this Sahaja Yoga?

30:51.720 --> 30:55.360
There's no sense of donation in you, at all.

30:55.560 --> 31:01.080
For a guru, one must know how to donate.

31:01.480 --> 31:06.280
I am surprised sometimes, there is no sense of donation.

31:06.640 --> 31:11.560
We got something, say, terracotta from India, to help those people;

31:11.960 --> 31:15.080
and I was surprised that these Belgian women are so funny

31:15.280 --> 31:19.880
that they were telling everybody it is expensive.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.400
If they don't want to buy, they need not buy.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.160
Others were willing to buy but they, these women were telling

31:26.360 --> 31:28.200
that these things are expensive.

31:28.520 --> 31:35.160
Where do you contribute for Sahaja Yoga?

31:38.840 --> 31:41.760
Now we had to have this pendal.

31:41.960 --> 31:47.200
We had to have all kinds of things. What do you contribute?

31:47.640 --> 31:51.560
This attachment to money can never be good for a guru.

31:51.760 --> 31:55.720
I have no attachment at all. If you ask anyone they'll tell you,

31:55.920 --> 31:59.960
even My husband will tell that,

32:00.560 --> 32:03.360
that from inside I am absolutely detached.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.440
I don't know also, I don't know banking,

32:05.640 --> 32:06.920
I don't know how to keep accounts,

32:07.120 --> 32:09.440
somebody keep accounts, somebody does that.

32:09.640 --> 32:13.640
But this attachment to money in Sahaja Yoga –

32:14.000 --> 32:17.440
I won't say like Christ that you'll all go to hell,

32:17.840 --> 32:20.680
but you won't rise much higher.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.640
You have come for your spiritual ascent.

32:23.840 --> 32:26.520
I don't say you go to Himalayas, stand in the cold,

32:26.720 --> 32:30.760
stand on your heads, nothing of the kind.

32:31.080 --> 32:39.360
But the another defect they call in Me is

32:39.560 --> 32:44.840
that I never tell them that “you must contribute.”

32:46.400 --> 32:50.960
It is to be done with pleasure, with happiness,

32:51.240 --> 32:56.400
that you can contribute something to Sahaja Yoga.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.720
In any case, whether you give it or not,

33:02.920 --> 33:05.800
I'll have to contribute for Turkey, no doubt.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
I'll do that.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.760
Now this kind of a thing as a market is there –

33:13.960 --> 33:16.720
“It's very expensive. This is cheap, this, that” –

33:16.960 --> 33:20.200
this is just an excuse because I know you can never contribute

33:20.400 --> 33:23.600
even twenty dollars for anything.

33:23.800 --> 33:27.560
So I bring their clothes, all right.

33:27.880 --> 33:33.080
They have stitched the shirts, sent it here, and now –

33:34.600 --> 33:35.920
I'm surprised.

33:36.120 --> 33:40.640
But if the free presents are given, it's very much acceptable,

33:40.920 --> 33:44.960
and nobody sees how expensive it is.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.560
So now I would say that on money matters

33:49.760 --> 33:56.560
a guru has to be absolutely detached and giving, and generous.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.080
You'll enjoy your generosity but the problem is,

34:00.280 --> 34:04.000
you are not generous at all.

34:04.640 --> 34:09.880
You think Sahaja Yoga is another market-place where you have come.

34:13.680 --> 34:17.960
So the generosity part is so much missing,

34:18.520 --> 34:21.840
and it is very surprising.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.920
They asked Me that “Mother, please,

34:25.120 --> 34:30.680
we need some chiffon skirts and blouses for this summer.”

34:30.960 --> 34:33.680
You stitch them for them, bring all the way;

34:33.880 --> 34:37.560
nobody wants to buy, it's all lying there.

34:37.880 --> 34:42.600
There's no shopping here. So I'm going to tell you that

34:42.800 --> 34:44.600
as long as all these things are exhausted,

34:44.800 --> 34:51.600
I am not going to ask any country to send anything here for sale.

34:56.480 --> 35:00.240
To believe that you are Sahaja yogis, you are sadly mistaken.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.080
Your attention so much - you'll go to hairdressers,

35:03.280 --> 35:08.920
you'll do all kinds of things, but for Sahaja Yoga you have no money.

35:09.600 --> 35:13.840
Today, as everybody has said,

35:14.040 --> 35:19.320
“Mother, you should be little stern, You must tell,” I'm telling you this.

35:19.520 --> 35:23.960
Your progress will be very slow.

35:28.360 --> 35:32.080
Secondly, you have to introspect to find out,

35:32.280 --> 35:36.280
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

35:36.720 --> 35:41.720
How many people you have given realization? You have powers.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.920
These gurus never had powers, though they were realized souls;

35:45.120 --> 35:49.840
you have powers to give realization, how many of you have done it?

35:50.160 --> 35:52.320
And once you start doing that,

35:52.520 --> 35:55.160
you get about ten people, twenty people from somewhere,

35:55.360 --> 35:57.560
you become great masters

35:57.760 --> 36:01.600
and you start talking about your great mastery

36:01.800 --> 36:04.520
and that you know everything,

36:04.720 --> 36:09.200
that you are the guru, you are the Adi Shakti.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.960
This is at the Agnya level.

36:13.240 --> 36:19.480
As soon as you reach the Agnya level you get this into your heads.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.160
So many, of course, have done so much for Sahaja Yoga,

36:23.360 --> 36:27.240
otherwise it would not have been possible to see this today.

36:27.480 --> 36:30.400
For all those who have not done anything,

36:30.600 --> 36:34.960
I must tell you that you are just standing at the same steps.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.560
Your kundalini has risen but you have done nothing,

36:38.800 --> 36:41.520
nothing to give it to others.

36:41.720 --> 36:46.160
Unless and until you give it, you cannot grow.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.320
There are many I know who don't want to give

36:49.520 --> 36:51.600
because they think “we'll catch.”

36:51.800 --> 36:58.280
Don't want to look after others because they think they'll get egos.

36:59.960 --> 37:03.640
This is not the way to be in Sahaja Yoga.

37:03.880 --> 37:10.120
You have to do something which is very important, to spread Sahaja Yoga.

37:10.320 --> 37:15.280
We are talking of global peace, of global transformation,

37:15.480 --> 37:19.880
and what are we doing for it?

37:20.600 --> 37:26.640
First improve your quality. And that improvement can only come

37:26.840 --> 37:30.520
through sincere, honest introspection,

37:30.720 --> 37:37.600
and also witnessing yourself every moment, how you behave.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.960
I must tell you about Myself,

37:45.200 --> 37:50.960
that from My very childhood I was like a grandmother.

37:52.200 --> 37:55.240
I would not tolerate anything nonsense,

37:55.480 --> 38:00.000
any stupid jokes, anything, like a grandmother.

38:00.400 --> 38:03.960
And now I am a grandmother also.

38:06.440 --> 38:10.440
And this maturity has to come in you.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.720
To talk cheaply is all right,

38:15.920 --> 38:18.600
some people have that habit – they are no Sahaja yogis.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.800
But the ones who follow them and talk like that,

38:23.480 --> 38:25.040
shows that they have no maturity.

38:25.240 --> 38:30.600
If they were matured they would change all these people.

38:31.600 --> 38:36.760
Whenever there are matured people, they definitely transform others.

38:37.080 --> 38:44.080
And their own behaviour, people are surprised how they are.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.560
This may be exceptional, may be very few like that.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.840
But only thing why I am pointing it out to you,

38:54.080 --> 38:58.400
that when you find somebody like that,

38:58.760 --> 39:04.800
then please try not to listen to such a person,

39:05.080 --> 39:06.680
not to follow such a person.

39:06.880 --> 39:10.320
But such a person is extremely forward type

39:10.640 --> 39:13.360
and everybody becomes sort of a follower

39:13.560 --> 39:19.040
of such a useless Sahaja yogi, so-called.

39:19.600 --> 39:24.240
So we have to mature. Now how do we mature?

39:24.440 --> 39:26.760
Many ask Me this question.

39:26.960 --> 39:32.480
We mature by meditation, by nirvicharita.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.120
You have to be in thoughtless awareness to grow,

39:36.320 --> 39:38.480
otherwise you cannot grow.

39:38.680 --> 39:44.120
Now, you should practice this thoughtless awareness otherwise also.

39:44.320 --> 39:50.760
Say you are walking on the road, suddenly you see a beautiful tree,

39:50.960 --> 39:55.280
you should become thoughtless. Creation of Divine –

39:55.480 --> 39:58.120
how beautiful it is! You should become thoughtless.

39:58.320 --> 40:02.120
In thoughtless Sahaj works, otherwise it does not work.

40:02.320 --> 40:06.840
You plan everything, you do everything, it won't work out.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.640
If you leave it to Sahaj, it will work out.

40:10.840 --> 40:15.080
But that never means that you should be lazy about it,

40:15.680 --> 40:20.360
or also unsystematic – no.

40:21.400 --> 40:25.720
You have to be alert, extremely alert, because if you are not alert

40:25.920 --> 40:30.760
you will not see how the Sahaj is helping you.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.680
I'll give an example.

40:34.880 --> 40:38.720
Supposing you want to meet somebody.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.720
Now that person has said, “I'll meet you at eleven o'clock,” say for example.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.560
You have to be alert. He said he'll meet you at eleven.

40:48.760 --> 40:53.960
By some chance you are late, supposing.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.760
So you should be alert that you are late for the gentleman.

40:59.040 --> 41:05.200
At that time, you should give a bandhan or raise your kundalini,

41:05.400 --> 41:09.320
do something, so that you meet that person in any case,

41:09.520 --> 41:14.240
whether you are late or not. But normally you should not be late.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.480
If you just give a bandhan and say,

41:16.680 --> 41:19.400
“I must be there at eleven o'clock,” you'll be there.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.160
Sahaj will help you.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.480
But you even forget to give bandhans,

41:24.680 --> 41:26.480
you even forget to raise your kundalini,

41:26.680 --> 41:31.080
you even forget to give vibrations.

41:31.440 --> 41:36.160
So to mature, first of all you should know you are now Sahaja yogis,

41:36.360 --> 41:40.880
and that you can control the whole situation

41:41.080 --> 41:46.360
if you are one with this all-pervading Power.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.000
It's very simple.

41:51.320 --> 41:55.600
It was very hot, everybody was saying it's very hot. All right.

41:55.840 --> 42:02.320
I got up, I said, “I'll make it,” within fifteen minutes I made it cool.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.600
I say, “I made it” – “I,” but it's not “I.”

42:06.800 --> 42:11.480
My connection with this all-pervading Power has done the job.

42:11.680 --> 42:17.680
But the connection has to be sincere, strong, honest,

42:17.920 --> 42:24.640
and all the time in your mind you should know

42:24.960 --> 42:28.160
that you are connected.

42:28.400 --> 42:33.400
This situation is very simple to achieve,

42:33.600 --> 42:40.680
this state where you all the time feel “I am one with the Divine”.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.120
Because you are not alert,

42:43.320 --> 42:50.080
you don't want to see the miracles of this great Power

42:50.280 --> 42:53.360
which you are in connection.

42:53.680 --> 42:58.240
You are busy with other things, your attention is somewhere else,

42:58.440 --> 43:02.320
you're looking at other things.

43:02.840 --> 43:07.280
And then suddenly you say, “Mother, how is it I am such a Sahaja yogi,

43:07.480 --> 43:12.040
I could not do this and that?”

43:17.080 --> 43:20.120
What's going on there?

43:23.520 --> 43:29.600
Even when I am speaking I see people are busy with something else.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.720
So what you call,

43:32.960 --> 43:41.720
is to mature through your meditation in nirvicharita –

43:42.360 --> 43:46.440
in thoughtless awareness.

43:48.200 --> 43:55.480
Unless and until you enlarge the state of thoughtless awareness

43:56.240 --> 44:01.320
you cannot mature, because only in the present you can mature,

44:01.520 --> 44:06.760
and present is thoughtless awareness.

44:07.760 --> 44:10.560
And I have seen what is happening,

44:10.800 --> 44:19.120
that people are only expecting

44:19.320 --> 44:22.760
all kinds of miracles from Sahaja Yoga,

44:22.960 --> 44:27.160
all kinds of help from Sahaja Yoga,

44:27.360 --> 44:34.360
but they never think “what help are we doing?"

44:39.080 --> 44:42.200
"What are we achieving?"

44:42.440 --> 44:45.920
"Where are we?”

44:46.880 --> 44:49.400
So at the Agnya again,

44:49.640 --> 44:54.960
you people have to be extremely, extremely careful.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.240
Now this is for men.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.560
If you have not crossed your Agnya

45:01.840 --> 45:05.160
and you start spreading Sahaja Yoga,

45:05.400 --> 45:11.200
then you can become really a funny person,

45:11.520 --> 45:13.680
not a Sahaja yogi.

45:14.080 --> 45:18.720
This leadership business is a myth,

45:18.920 --> 45:23.280
and this myth must be seen as a myth.

45:23.760 --> 45:29.040
Whether you are leader or not leader makes no difference.

45:30.240 --> 45:32.240
But the maturity has to come.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.040
Now I am telling all this because

45:35.240 --> 45:40.960
I have decided not to punish anybody in this lifetime.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.520
So that you see for yourself,

45:47.680 --> 45:50.440
yourself you understand,

45:50.720 --> 45:55.280
yourself you realize. I know you very well, all of you, somehow.

45:56.760 --> 46:01.280
But I want you to realize yourself,

46:01.760 --> 46:05.240
“What are we doing wrong?" "Where are we doing right?”

46:05.440 --> 46:11.480
and don't judge Sahaja Yoga on what merits you get out of it.

46:12.240 --> 46:16.320
If you are not getting merits, there's something wrong with you.

46:16.960 --> 46:19.960
If you can really understand this,

46:20.240 --> 46:23.360
then you will become subtler and subtler

46:23.560 --> 46:29.920
and all your gross attachments will become absolutely negligible.

46:30.280 --> 46:36.040
You may have concern, but you won't have attachment.

46:36.600 --> 46:43.440
From inside, this complete detachment has to come in.

46:44.640 --> 46:47.720
And that can come, as I told you,

46:48.000 --> 46:52.280
getting rid of your anger, first.

46:53.040 --> 47:00.720
Secondly, getting rid of attachments to material things,

47:01.760 --> 47:04.760
by generosity.

47:06.920 --> 47:10.440
It's nice to give something to somebody,

47:10.640 --> 47:14.760
you enjoy your generosity, you really enjoy.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.000
Generosity is to be enjoyed.

47:19.520 --> 47:24.840
And once you start enjoying your generosity,

47:26.680 --> 47:30.000
then you realize that

47:31.200 --> 47:35.600
you, your love, your compassion,

47:35.840 --> 47:39.320
it has now started flowing to others.

47:39.640 --> 47:43.680
Little, little things are there.

47:44.040 --> 47:47.760
I have seen you all love Me and you do want always to give Me

47:47.960 --> 47:52.240
presents, presents, presents, presents, all right.

47:52.800 --> 47:59.080
But this love must spread to everybody else.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.720
You must know about others also,

48:02.920 --> 48:08.440
what they need and what you have to do.

48:11.520 --> 48:16.040
If somebody needs something, can you get it for that person?

48:16.400 --> 48:17.800
Can you love that person?

48:18.000 --> 48:25.000
Can you give it to the children of other people,

48:25.320 --> 48:28.640
something that you have?

48:28.880 --> 48:35.720
If this generosity could be just, maybe, I don't know,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.760
because I don't have to force Myself to be generous.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.680
Everybody says, “Mother, You are too generous” –

48:40.880 --> 48:45.600
in My family everybody thinks I am very generous and a gone case –

48:45.800 --> 48:47.360
but I don't have to generate.

48:47.560 --> 48:51.600
But perhaps you people through introspection

48:51.800 --> 48:55.160
will definitely become generous,

48:56.880 --> 49:00.880
and this generosity will start flowing.

49:01.080 --> 49:04.840
I've known people who have lots of money, lots of things,

49:05.080 --> 49:11.480
but not one single pai they'll give to Sahaja Yoga, not one single pai.

49:14.280 --> 49:17.720
This sense of generosity comes

49:18.320 --> 49:24.400
when you understand what is your purpose of life, why you are here.

49:25.040 --> 49:28.720
Just to fulfil yourself with Sahaja Yoga,

49:28.920 --> 49:35.760
or to be able to do something about it

49:35.960 --> 49:40.400
without feeling that you have done something?

49:40.640 --> 49:43.960
In this Christ has said very nicely –

49:44.160 --> 49:46.480
I mean that He has said it, but where do you find this? –

49:46.680 --> 49:52.760
that your left hand should not know what your right hand has given,

49:53.240 --> 49:57.720
should never trumpet, “I, I, I, I, I.”

49:58.200 --> 50:02.320
What Christ has said, to achieve that

50:02.520 --> 50:05.520
you had to have realization, no doubt.

50:05.960 --> 50:11.240
But I would say fifth chapter of Matthews you read.

50:11.440 --> 50:16.440
Such things, so subtle He did that you'll be surprised that

50:16.640 --> 50:23.680
how this religion in the name of Christ has gone on the other side of it.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.440
Now people want to be gurus

50:31.720 --> 50:36.640
because they think you have powers;

50:37.120 --> 50:39.760
that you can overpower others,

50:39.960 --> 50:42.880
you can say whatever you like to others,

50:43.120 --> 50:47.480
you can torture anyone you feel like.

50:50.080 --> 50:54.120
That has been before, I know.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.440
Gurus have been very, very …

50:56.640 --> 51:00.680
very, very cruel to their disciples also, I know that.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.600
Once I went to Ambarnath,

51:04.840 --> 51:07.320
and one gentleman came to see Me,

51:07.520 --> 51:11.320
his name was Swami Jagannath, and he said that

51:11.520 --> 51:17.760
“My guru has told me that Adi Shakti is going to come to Ambarnath,

51:17.960 --> 51:20.200
and I will try to come at that time.”

51:20.400 --> 51:25.080
I said, “Who is your guru?” So he told Me some name.

51:25.360 --> 51:30.760
He was a realized soul, no doubt. So he came down.

51:31.280 --> 51:35.480
He said, “Mother, should he come to You, or You will go to him?”

51:35.680 --> 51:38.400
I said, “See, I am a Mother. I am not a guru.”

51:38.640 --> 51:42.480
The gurus don't leave their places, can you imagine?

51:42.680 --> 51:44.800
They call it takiya.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.480
The guru should not leave his place,

51:46.680 --> 51:49.480
should sit there and everybody must come to him.

51:49.680 --> 51:53.800
I said, “I am the Mother, I will go and meet him.”

51:54.400 --> 51:57.160
So I met him

51:57.520 --> 52:01.400
and the fellow who had come, this Jagannath fellow -

52:01.680 --> 52:03.440
I said, “What's the matter with you?

52:03.640 --> 52:08.040
Why don't you open his Agnya? He's in so much pain.”

52:08.320 --> 52:12.640
He said, “Who opened my Agnya? Why should I open his Agnya?”

52:12.880 --> 52:15.120
I said, “You are the guru, you are the master.”

52:15.320 --> 52:18.240
“So what? My guru never opened my Agnya.

52:18.440 --> 52:20.480
I had to fight my ego all the time

52:20.680 --> 52:24.640
and that's how I have got everything all right.”

52:25.600 --> 52:30.040
So I said, “It's so easy to open the Agnya. Why can't you open?”

52:30.240 --> 52:33.880
So I turned his Agnya and opened it, he was very happy.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.560
He said, “You are a mother, You do what You like.

52:36.760 --> 52:39.560
We are not going to do this.

52:39.760 --> 52:43.600
If you don't make them work hard for their realization,

52:43.800 --> 52:47.840
if you don't make them work hard for their development,

52:48.080 --> 52:52.240
they will never be all right. These human beings are like this.”

52:52.440 --> 52:54.560
I said, “Not for Me.”

52:54.760 --> 52:57.080
He said, “All right, You are a mother, You forgive them,

52:57.280 --> 53:02.840
You do what You like, You try to transform them, help them. But not me.”

53:03.120 --> 53:06.640
I said, “All right.” But you know, he came at My feet and all that,

53:06.840 --> 53:08.760
and he said that “You must praise.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.920
She is Adi Shakti. You must praise Her now.”

53:11.120 --> 53:15.360
He was there for a short time. Then we were coming home,

53:15.560 --> 53:17.960
then this Baba Jagannath tells Me,

53:18.160 --> 53:22.320
“Mother, thank God You have opened my Agnya.”

53:22.520 --> 53:24.080
So I said, “What happened?”

53:24.280 --> 53:27.880
“My guru when I came, he gave me two slaps on the face.

53:28.080 --> 53:31.000
I was running his ashram, supposed to be the guru.

53:31.200 --> 53:36.720
Two slaps, and put me upside down on the well.

53:36.960 --> 53:43.480
And all the time my feet were tied up to the rope

53:43.680 --> 53:47.200
which he used to lower down, again bring me up.

53:47.480 --> 53:51.920
So he put me again and again into the water seven times,

53:52.160 --> 53:56.560
then he pulled me out.” I said, “Baba, why did he do that?”

53:56.800 --> 54:02.160
He said, “I must tell You that I have been smoking sometimes.”

54:02.480 --> 54:04.440
For that.

54:04.640 --> 54:07.320
But I said, “He never gave you realization?

54:07.520 --> 54:10.200
You would be smoking in any case, that’s it.”

54:10.400 --> 54:14.920
“He wants me to give up all these bad habits with my Agnya on.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.280
Now You have opened my Agnya, I'm all right.”

54:17.480 --> 54:23.840
So I felt that the behaviour of that guru was very surprising.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.520
He says, “He beats us.

54:26.720 --> 54:30.760
He always beats us for anything and we have to work very hard.”

54:30.960 --> 54:36.360
I also know of the, some gurus of the music also do that,

54:36.560 --> 54:42.560
and I met so many of such people who have been to very great gurus

54:42.800 --> 54:47.720
and the way I got the report was so shocking to Me,

54:47.920 --> 54:50.440
that why don't they tell them directly that

54:50.640 --> 54:54.880
“See, this is wrong with you, and this is how you should be”?

54:55.360 --> 54:58.400
But the gurus say that if you tell them like that,

54:58.600 --> 55:00.800
they'll never listen.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.040
“They only know the beating.”

55:04.240 --> 55:07.760
I said, “Ba! What do you say?

55:07.960 --> 55:10.600
They only know beatings?” “Yes.”

55:10.800 --> 55:14.160
So the whole attitude towards the disciple

55:14.360 --> 55:17.920
is not of compassion, in fact.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.080
There are of course other gurus also

55:20.280 --> 55:26.760
who take a terrible test of their disciples.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.600
Like as you see, Shri Ramdas.

55:29.800 --> 55:34.120
This was nothing compared to what Raja Janaka did.

55:34.400 --> 55:39.200
They will test the person and then only give realization,

55:39.400 --> 55:43.320
and out of thousands, to one only.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.720
That is how we've got so many false gurus also,

55:48.920 --> 55:54.720
because they were all discarded by these realized souls, so.

55:55.720 --> 55:58.120
At this point

55:58.880 --> 56:04.800
we have people who have got realization,

56:06.600 --> 56:10.920
when the real gurus are like this.

56:12.680 --> 56:15.760
I met another one, he asked Me,

56:15.960 --> 56:19.760
“Why are You giving realization to all these useless people?”

56:20.040 --> 56:22.440
I said, “Why?” And there were some Sahaja yogis,

56:22.640 --> 56:26.680
he said, “How many can give life for Shri Mataji?”

56:27.040 --> 56:31.120
I said, “Why do you want to ask for their life?  I don't want their life.”

56:31.440 --> 56:35.000
He said, “This is the first question," he said,

56:35.600 --> 56:37.760
"those - I have many who will give life for me.”

56:37.960 --> 56:41.480
And he has not given them realization.

56:42.360 --> 56:47.840
So now at this juncture, when we have people who are seeking,

56:48.040 --> 56:49.440
who are going to these gurus –

56:49.640 --> 56:52.760
of course false gurus you forget, but even real gurus –

56:52.960 --> 56:55.680
they do not get their realization.

56:55.960 --> 57:01.200
Now, you are capable of giving them realization – just imagine.

57:01.880 --> 57:04.640
They have big, big ashrams and things like that,

57:04.840 --> 57:08.120
they cannot give realization.

57:08.320 --> 57:12.200
While you can, all of you can give.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.320
Now, it's like this,

57:17.880 --> 57:24.840
that if you put little light in a lamp

57:28.240 --> 57:35.680
and it is just giving light to itself, nothing else, supposing.

57:37.400 --> 57:41.560
Now you have to give light to others.

57:41.760 --> 57:46.520
You have powers, you can do it.

57:46.920 --> 57:52.600
You can really change people, you can cure them –

57:54.920 --> 57:57.200
but, you will not.

57:57.400 --> 58:02.960
You will bring all these sick people to Me, “Mother, You cure.”

58:04.520 --> 58:09.600
Even for realization I've seen they bring people to Me.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.520
What is the need?

58:11.720 --> 58:16.960
You all know how to give realization, how to cure a person.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.680
All of you know.

58:21.200 --> 58:26.440
Now why is it that you people cannot do it?

58:26.800 --> 58:29.920
Firstly, you may not be matured enough.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.280
But even if you are mature,

58:33.560 --> 58:36.240
you are not assuming your own powers,

58:36.480 --> 58:39.560
you don't believe in it.

58:41.800 --> 58:47.560
Humility is all right, but you must know what power it is.

58:47.760 --> 58:50.720
Supposing somebody is a king, say,

58:50.960 --> 58:54.760
and you put him on the throne.

58:55.280 --> 58:59.640
Now if people are coming and instead of they touching his feet,

58:59.840 --> 59:02.560
he goes and touches each and everybody's feet –

59:02.760 --> 59:07.520
this is no humility. This is nonsense.

59:07.720 --> 59:11.080
Whatever position you have,

59:11.280 --> 59:18.040
you should try to do with humility, means through compassion.

59:22.680 --> 59:27.680
The maturity is this, that you should know that you have these powers,

59:27.880 --> 59:30.600
you should know how to preserve these powers,

59:30.840 --> 59:33.680
you should know how to grow in peace,

59:33.920 --> 59:41.400
and then when you meet people you should assume, inside.

59:45.240 --> 59:50.360
I may be a housewife cooking for My grandchildren,

59:50.560 --> 59:53.600
doing this, doing that.

59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.400
But once I am sitting on the chair, I know what I am.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.960
You may be anything - you may be a clerk, you may be dishwasher,

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.280
you may be anything, that makes no difference.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:15.360
But once you are a Sahaja yogi, you are a Sahaja yogi.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.160
Then you must show your dignity

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.640
and not thrive on your weaknesses.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.120
You are much better than all these realized souls

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.880
who have achieved their realization in thousands of years,

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.160
because you have so many powers.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:42.040
But their self-confidence

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:47.280
and assumption is not with you.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.600
Some people say, “We are afraid of ego.” How can you have ego?

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.840
It's finished.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.120
Even if you do some mistakes, doesn't matter.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.760
“Mother, I touched my left foot, I touched my right” –

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.560
makes no difference.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:20.160
Because of no self-confidence you become austere in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.080
If you are self-confident,

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.240
then why should you be austere?

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.400
It all goes together.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.880
First you must mature, with that you must have self-confidence,

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:46.520
and without fear you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.720
Some have fear about themselves and some have fear about others.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.800
Also it comes from your conditionings, from your upbringing.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.800
So today's Guru Puja is in a way very important,

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.840
because everybody said, “Mother, You should be stern,

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.800
You must tell them and You must - ”

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.360
I said, “All right, I'll tell them.”

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.160
But in no way to put you down, no way;

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.760
but to tell you what you can achieve.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.560
To tell you how far you can go.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.240
You, so many are more than sufficient

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.560
to transform at least ten globes,

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.880
ten worlds, more than sufficient.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.320
But you are still involved in yourself, worried about yourself,

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.600
only your children, your husband, this, that –

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.000
doesn't work out.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.800
As much as you want to grow,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.080
this power can give you that power.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.960
But problem that lies with us is that

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.080
we don't know ourselves,

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:08.040
and we don't want to know ourselves.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:17.240
Today's Guru Puja should give you the state of guru.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:27.840
If you want, it can work out.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:38.080
The all-pervading divine Power of Love is absolutely working it out.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.800
More than you, the Divine wants this world to change,

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.960
wants to transform the whole universe.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.640
Now you are the instruments,

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.360
and if you try to cheat yourself,

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.720
who can stop it?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.200
Just to enjoy music,

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.440
or to enjoy the company, or belonging to some club,

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.160
or to feel that it's a nice festival;

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.360
or at the most you seek

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.480
the security of your children and family and all that -

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.360
it is not satisfying.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.640
It will never satisfy you.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.480
It will only satisfy you when you will become the lights

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.600
to give it to others, to work for others.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.320
And you have these powers, what I'm trying to tell again and again,

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.640
you have these powers by which you can introspect yourself,

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.720
you can witness yourself, and you can surrender.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:05.720
Because mentally now you are convinced about Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.760
Emotionally you are convinced

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.960
that Sahaja Yoga has given you such sense of love and compassion.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.120
Physically you are convinced that Sahaja Yoga has given you good health

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.360
and confidence about your health.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.520
Now spiritually you should be convinced, spiritually,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:42.360
that you are really spiritual people selected by the Divine;

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.240
that your last lives have been of great seeking,

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.440
that's why you are born now, and you are getting all these blessings.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:57.440
So assume. assumption of your personality is important.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:04.240
You must meditate, you should go into thoughtless awareness,

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:11.160
and all the time keep your attention alert.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
That is very important.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.480
When, what is the need, when something will come,

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.400
how we have to react –

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.640
all these things come to you when you are alert

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:36.920
and aware of this all-pervading Power all the time, every moment.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.880
I don't worry at all, never . Everybody is surprised at Me.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.080
I don't worry.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.440
Why? My worry is taken over.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.000
People say, “You travel, travel.” I never travel.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.280
I'm sitting here or I'm sitting there, what is it?

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.000
Where am I travelling?

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.480
So you don't think on those lines.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:12.000
So thoughtless awareness is the first beautiful state

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.560
you have to achieve. That will give you peace

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.600
and a witness state to enjoy the drama of life,

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.680
to enjoy the different varieties of people,

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.960
while you will be growing within yourself.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:40.760
For a Sahaja yogi is important not to see the faults of others

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.200
but your own faults, and correct them.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.840
I get so many letters regarding some lady

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.680
or some leader or somebody like that.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.200
That “Mother, this leader is troubling me,

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.520
that leader is troubling me, this, that.”

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.760
I'm surprised.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.320
I will change the leader as soon as I’ll find something wrong,

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.240
I've always done –

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.160
who is not suitable, who is in problem, is always done.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.080
But the way you put your attention to the leader is

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.080
perhaps the jealousy part.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.520
If the leader says something wrong with you, you should thank him.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:25.320
Who is there to tell you?

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.320
I'm very proud of you, I'm very happy,

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.840
that never such disciples existed for any guru.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:42.160
If I'm a guru, I should say, I should say now done, finished, - overjoyed.

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.360
But when I see that you people don't realize what you have achieved,

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.920
and you don't want to work it out,

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.360
then I think of the parable of Christ

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.480
that some seeds fell on the rock.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.120
All your affection, all your love,

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:09.240
I know it is impossible to express what I feel about it.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.960
But you don't know why you got realization,

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.000
why you are here, what is your speciality, what you have to get.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.040
You don't know that.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:22.440
And that is what you have to know.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.800
I don't say like Christ that take out one eye

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:31.640
or take out one, cut out your hand – nothing of the kind.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.040
You’ll be intact, your body should be intact, nothing is to be taken out.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.760
We need this body. But,

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.760
in a subtle way what He was saying,

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.920
that whatever part of your body is doing wrong,

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.200
you should try to negate it – in a subtle way.

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.600
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga also,

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.200
if there is jealousy try to find out why you are a jealous,

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440
why are you against the leader?

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.760
The leader says a word to somebody, they immediately write to Me.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.800
Why is he leader, if he has not to tell anything?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.560
Today I think for the first time I have been able to tell something to you

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.440
which I was hesitating always,

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.760
that “Let it be, just now they are still little babies, it's all right.”

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.080
But now, after this you have to grow,

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.120
grow in every way.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.960
I just can't understand.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:42.480
Those who got realization without the power of raising the kundalini

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.080
are doing such a lot of work.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.920
And while you all have this power to raise the kundalini,

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.360
to cure people, and also to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.920
you are so sensible.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.440
Still where is your attention, I don't understand.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:10.880
Today's lecture should not really in any way hurt you,

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.960
because I don't want to hurt you at all.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.120
Whatever is the situation, I accept.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.840
But if you don't want to accept that situation,

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.080
what you should do I have told you.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:34.560
This will definitely suddenly raise your spiritual height – definitely.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.320
No doubt about it.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:44.480
It's very important to see for yourself what's wrong.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.800
After all, you are all seekers of truth for ages,

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.040
and now you've come, you have found the truth.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.640
So try to identify yourself with truth, that's all.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.200
And with reality.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.880
If you identify yourself with truth and with reality,

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.720
your Sahasrara is absolutely open. No problem.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.680
Truth is in your Sahasrara.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.280
And when the truth comes in, you are surprised

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.960
that truth is love and love is truth –

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.960
pure love.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.480
It's very, very joy-giving,

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.560
and all the niranandas you want to have,

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.680
you can have, if you understand this simple equation

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:43.440
that absolute truth is absolute love.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.880
I have no expectations.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.680
I must tell you I am oversatisfied.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.560
As far as I am concerned, I think I have done My job.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:04.640
But now this has to be taken over, you have to be responsible.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.960
You have to work it out. I was so happy, this time every place I went to,

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.560
all the leaders said that “Mother,

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.400
You need not travel, now we take the responsibility.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.600
We'll work it out.”

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.480
But all of you must support your leaders and do something about it.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.240
Sometimes leaders are really, they can't understand

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.680
why people are having their own ideas about everything.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.480
You must go all out.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:46.840
For example, in our country when we wanted to remove the slavery,

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:53.600
everyone joined together to achieve it.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.840
While there are people who are trying to cut down the leaders,

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.640
put them down, make fun of them, form groups.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.360
Is this the way we are going to work it out?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.440
You all should support the leader.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.680
You should all go all out to do what the leader is telling you.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.440
If something is wrong with the leader I'll talk to him,

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.160
then I'll put him right, I promise you.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.040
But you don't try to find faults.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.040
As it is all the leaders ask Me before doing something.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.560
So you just try to follow the leaders, whatever the leader is saying,

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.320
absolutely put all your effort.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:49.040
Because the complaints are that you people don't listen to them –

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.440
I'm really surprised.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.640
Yesterday you saw he was playing sitar.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.680
You should have asked him, what about his guru?

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.400
His own father was his guru and he used to beat him,

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.280
and then his grandfather also.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.000
But with such desire to learn something, to be something

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.520
that they didn't mind anything,

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.840
“Beat me, do what you like, put me in jail,

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.920
but make me a good artist.”

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.240
In the same way is Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.160
Because there is, if you may call it a defect,

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.920
Sahaja Yoga is not a military thing,

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:44.080
it's just plain, simple, Mother's love.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.960
And of course every mother wants her child to be great,

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.920
to have all her powers – she wants that, no doubt.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:02.306
How she does it, how she works it out

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.320
is her own problem.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.720
But how you take it and how you use it is your own problem.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.200
I always bow to you people who have got realization,

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.600
because I think so many saints were never there on this earth.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.040
But the saintliness has to be complete.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.880
Without that you cannot help even your family,

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:35.320
leave alone your country, and no question of the whole world.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:42.040
So what is needed now is to raise your awakening,

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.880
to raise your spirituality,

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:51.880
to go into a realm of complete support and surrender

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:59.280
to the movement of this spontaneous movement of Sahaja Yoga.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.280
May God bless you all.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.480
In short, you must worship yourself – in short.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.840
All right.

02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:28.400
Hymns to Shri Guru Dakshinamurti by Shri Adi Shankaracharya

02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:32.760
- please don't take pictures now and meditate -

02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:38.440
Salutations to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:41.680
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:46.120
who gives the Self Realization and Enlightenment,

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:48.120
that is the Spirit,

02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:52.480
which is everywhere and the universe within,

02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:56.720
like the reflection of a town would be in a mirror,

02:28:56.920 --> 02:28:59.040
but which appears outside

02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:02.480
like a dream seen in a sleep.

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:07.360
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:10.480
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:17.040
who like a mandarin or a maha yogi creates through her maya

02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:20.960
at her own free will this universe

02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:26.240
which was within her like a tree is in the seed.

02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:31.080
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:33.680
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:38.200
whose presence is felt as the pulsation everywhere

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:41.000
in this illusöry universe,

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:42.960
who gives enlightenment

02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:47.640
of "Thou Are That" to those who surrender

02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:52.040
and whose realization would obviate repeated birth

02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:55.040
in the ocean of illusion.

02:29:55.560 --> 02:30:00.400
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:03.560
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:08.480
whose knowledge pulsates from our own being

02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:13.280
like the light of a lamp being placed into a pitcher

02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:19.680
having numerous holes and thereby reveals the true nature

02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:23.360
of all that is there in the universe.

02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:28.320
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:31.480
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:36.240
who by Her Grace removes the ocean of illusion

02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:38.800
that has come into existence

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:42.320
due to the imagination and play of Maya

02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:49.080
and because of which people go into the state of "branthi"

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:52.160
and forget their spirit.

02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:57.280
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:00.520
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:07.320
by whose Grace one receives the realization of ones spirit

02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:12.120
which is until then overcast by Maya

02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:17.320
like the moon is overshadowed by the planet rahu.

02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:23.640
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:26.720
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:29.960
whose manifestations are the five elements,

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:33.160
the sun, the moon and the spirit

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:35.920
and whose presence is felt everywhere

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:39.360
in the universe by enlightened souls.

02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:44.480
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:47.960
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:52.560
the Guru and Lord of the three locas,

02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:57.000
who is alert to remove the ??grids of birth and death,

02:31:57.200 --> 02:31:59.360
who is seated on the ground at the basis

02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:03.520
of the banyan tree, that is the tree of life

02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:08.880
and is enlightening all the saints and sages.

02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:11.800
The guru is silent -

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:19.360
is silent, but disciples of the guru become doubtless.

02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:25.920
The guru looks young and the disciples old.

02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:31.320
Salutation again and again to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:34.480
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:41.240
who manifests herself before her devotees in ??bhandra mudra -

02:32:41.440 --> 02:32:44.760
the posture conferring benevolence

02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:49.360
and enlightens them with realization of their spirit,

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:51.760
pulsating through their being,

02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:57.360
in all the three states of childhood, young age and old age -

02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:03.000
wakefulness, dreams and deep sleep.

02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:08.320
Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji,

02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:14.840
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:37.280
The international present for this Puja.

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:29.400
Steven Taylor from Australia is asking Shri Mataji to bless posters

02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:34.920
that he will distribute for each countries here present.

02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:38.920
This picture has been taken at Easter Puja in Australia.

02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:52.440
Now this is also the weekend in which

02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:58.560
the greatest fragment of the comet was hitting Jupiter,

02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:04.720
and Jupiter has absorbed this aggression in itself,

02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:07.920
symbolizing the wholesomeness of Dharma.

02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:11.840
So on behalf of Africa,

02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.760
I'd like to ask our sister Al Ga'

02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:19.760
to present to Shri Mataji a present

02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:23.120
which symbolizes the wholesomeness of Jupiter

02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:26.200
and the wholesomeness of Dharma.

02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:09.920
This is a collection of miracle pictures

02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:13.680
which is a gift of the Italian Sahaja yogis to everybody

02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:19.520
who participated in this Puja and it will be distributed afterwards.

02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:21.520
And now this is a present to commemorate this very auspicious day

02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:23.680
that the Italian sahaja yogis

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:28.200
are presenting to Sir C.P. Shrivastava.

02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:38.600
And all the countries who have a sari for Shri Mataji

02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:42.240
should gather these at this end of the stage

02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:45.720
and they will present the sari to Shri Mataji -

02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:48.560
all the small countries, who did not have an opportunity

02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:52.080
to offer sari to Shri Mataji before.

02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:10.160
Also Taiwan, please, take back your sari and present it again now.

02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:12.640
Taiwan.

02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:30.040
Mai sunt țări care au sariuri de oferit?

02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:44.600
And this from Vigevano an Italian city.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:10.480
The next present is from Cameroon.

02:53:55.200 --> 02:54:02.000
The next is Russia and Ukraine together.

02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:24.800
Dr. Voronov is presenting the present from Russia.

02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:54.640
Professor Voronov is the head of the academy of arts and sciences

02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:57.760
in Saint Petersburg.

02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:12.000
Greatest Woman of our planet,

02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:15.480
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:19.240
you have a good sputnik,

02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:24.840
satellite in Sir Shrivastava.

02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:29.800
Prominent government figura,

02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:34.680
one of the best sons of India.

02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:49.840
I am from my family and my friends,

02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:56.000
with open heart and good wish -

02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:02.600
one order Russia for you,

02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:08.320
"Great Patriotic War".

02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:26.800
It is order

02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:31.320
second mundial war.

02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:45.440
With pure, deep gratitude and sense from Russia

02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:49.800
I give you, Sir Shrivastava

02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:56.080
this order of the second mundial war,

02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:02.400
which was given my uncle in war.

02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:07.520
I hope that this kind of orders

02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:12.360
we'll prevent again be given for war -

02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:15.280
never!

02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:25.320
Can you escort him? Can you escort him?

02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:32.640
So professor Voronov presented Sir C.P.Shrivastava

02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:37.800
with a decoration that was in his family,

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.080
which was a distinction given in war

02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:43.840
with the wish that never there should be war again.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.680
Please sit down.

03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:14.920
This is a present from Rome and it represents a castle in crystal.

03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:35.680
You will have a copy of this picture,

03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:41.600
where you can see Shri Mataji in the middle of the vibrations.
