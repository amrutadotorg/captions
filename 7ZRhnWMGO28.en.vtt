00:00.008 --> 00:01.260
SM: Yeah, that’s a good idea.

00:01.461 --> 00:03.061
SY: O.k.

00:03.262 --> 00:05.039
SM: But you should have some accompaniment.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.440
There are people who can help. SY: Maybe that fellow...

00:07.641 --> 00:09.409
Somebody brought a

00:09.610 --> 00:11.461
guitar? Somebody will brought a guitar?

00:11.662 --> 00:14.300
SY: [Ethian] you brought a guitar, right?

00:14.501 --> 00:16.134
SY: I think she should stand up and and do it because...

00:16.359 --> 00:17.753
SY: Stand up!
SM: What you said?

00:17.960 --> 00:19.180
It will be better, isn't?

00:19.540 --> 00:21.920
Somebody should accompany her.  SY: She is going to sing English songs.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.960
Can you, can you not give her? SM: Come along!

00:24.200 --> 00:28.480
SY: No, I don't know, I mean how many... Maybe Antonio or Steve can play with.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.920
SM: Antonio, where is he?

00:32.116 --> 00:34.180
Come along, bring your guitar, come along.

00:34.381 --> 00:38.575
SY: I, I don't have. It's actually his guitar at the moment.

00:38.776 --> 00:42.604
SM: Can you lend him your guitar?

00:42.800 --> 00:46.140
SY: No problem. The problem solved.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.600
Come along.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.600
SY: Would you like the piano?

00:59.646 --> 01:01.978
SM: Just to hold the tune!

01:02.700 --> 01:04.894
[hindhi/marathi]

01:05.095 --> 01:06.914
SM: Just, just to hold the...

01:07.121 --> 01:09.678
You need not play if you just hold the... [unclear]

01:09.879 --> 01:11.686
SY: You will.

01:11.887 --> 01:15.473
SM: Alright?
SY: You will get the vibrations.

01:18.316 --> 01:19.973
Very good.

01:20.174 --> 01:22.951
SY: So, I guess I'll just start….

01:23.152 --> 01:25.456
and you can just come in whenever you want.

01:25.657 --> 01:28.254
SM: You best put your [glasses].
SY: Oh, that's nice!

01:28.455 --> 01:30.436
SM: Is it alright?
SY: I think so.

01:41.458 --> 01:44.917
SY: This song is called "What is the power of heart" and...

01:45.118 --> 01:49.567
[unclear] there is still one more verse that it has to be inspired but I was...

01:49.768 --> 01:53.018
inspired by actually [a widow]...

02:09.220 --> 02:10.712
SM: It's alright. SY: So, I'll just start.

04:43.462 --> 04:48.247
Oh, so, the next one is called,

04:49.539 --> 04:52.135
this one is called "Lovers and neighbors and Mary's best friends"

04:52.350 --> 04:54.384
and I don't really want to say what this mean,

04:54.585 --> 04:57.313
except that it is a little bit too in the experimental stage.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.882
SM: What have you been doing in Boston,

07:45.083 --> 07:48.901
with your music? Let’s have something from the Boston people.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.794
SY: Well...

07:51.995 --> 07:54.885
we haven't prepared anything yet, Mother.

07:56.889 --> 07:59.114
SY: He hasn't prepared anything yet.

07:59.315 --> 08:01.043
SY: From Santa Cruz, Mother,

08:02.045 --> 08:06.553
Doug Nicely, whom you have met, has written

08:06.754 --> 08:08.676
a few songs, for you.

08:08.877 --> 08:12.698
and he would love to come and sing himself.

08:12.899 --> 08:14.721
And the next best thing was taping.

08:14.922 --> 08:17.911
SY: I don't know if we a have good enough tape for play this to you.

08:21.153 --> 08:25.345
Exceptional this song - the first one - is the song about Realization,

08:25.554 --> 08:28.458
how he got his Realization, sort of romance,

08:28.659 --> 08:29.987
but still the essence is there;

08:30.188 --> 08:32.690
and it's... and the next one is a devotional song,

08:32.891 --> 08:35.311
and there's no words we can express.

08:36.551 --> 08:40.123
And the other one is a song written by Michael [Teashek]

08:40.324 --> 08:42.482
who is too shy to sing it,

08:42.683 --> 08:45.123
but he would sing it occasionally to Sahaja yogis,

08:45.324 --> 08:49.649
and so Doug can nicely sing it,

08:49.850 --> 08:52.545
exactly the way that Michael would sang it.

08:52.746 --> 08:55.594
So we can get a table for him and play this.

08:55.795 --> 08:58.432
And the other side, he wrote a song

08:58.633 --> 09:01.011
about the Devi, is like in Mahabharata

09:01.212 --> 09:03.124
the battle of good and evil

09:03.325 --> 09:06.312
and he wrote this just before he got his Realization.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.074
And in this, the battle between good and evils

09:09.275 --> 09:11.424
was a huge slaughter

09:11.625 --> 09:14.561
and evil conquered good.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.761
When he got his Self-Realization, he knew it is wrong,

09:18.033 --> 09:22.871
he rewrote the end, added one more verse, one more verse.

09:25.382 --> 09:26.421
SM: Should we hear that?

09:26.622 --> 09:29.660
SY: Which side, Mother?

09:29.861 --> 09:31.615
SM: Let's have before and after.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.147
SM: Are you alright, Doug?

09:45.348 --> 09:47.332
SY - Yes, thank you, yes, Mother.

09:48.816 --> 09:52.292
SM: I would like to, I would like to meet all the

09:52.493 --> 09:57.247
new Sahaja yogis who have come from New York or from Boston,

10:01.217 --> 10:03.900
in My room tomorrow morning, all right?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.060
SY: Mataji, the speakers are only in this room,

10:23.280 --> 10:26.720
so we open the doors, so you can hear it. Very fast.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.340
SM: What he is said?

10:28.551 --> 10:31.141
SY: He said that the speakers were in that room, Mother,

10:31.342 --> 10:34.053
so they play it, they have to play it from in there but,

10:34.254 --> 10:37.720
they'll open the doors, so you can hear it.

10:37.921 --> 10:39.246
SM: About videos?

10:39.447 --> 10:42.326
SY: The voice will come in from that room to this room.

10:42.527 --> 10:44.715
SM: Why?
SY: Because the speakers are there.

10:49.990 --> 10:52.200
SM: How could they done [unclear]

10:52.401 --> 10:53.813
SY: [unclear] can.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.360
SM: [unclear].

11:01.280 --> 11:05.500
You see, for breakfast we can have it. [unclear].

11:05.720 --> 11:07.980
We'll have it tomorrow at lunch then,

11:08.170 --> 11:09.235
we'll all be sitting here.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.436
SY: Yes, yes.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.681
SM: That would be better.

11:18.521 --> 11:21.619
SM: So let's have something from Boston!

11:21.820 --> 11:24.968
SY: Yeah, yeah. Come on Michael!

11:25.169 --> 11:26.927
SM: I said tomorrow we can hear.

11:27.128 --> 11:29.678
SY: Seems to be that way, Mother.

11:29.879 --> 11:32.571
SM: After lunch. SY - We come here again together.

11:33.886 --> 11:34.886
SM: Take this [unclear].

11:35.087 --> 11:38.310
SY: All right, I'll just be, have to be very spontaneous.

11:38.511 --> 11:40.932
SM: Better.

11:45.870 --> 11:48.338
SM: You want somebody else to join you?

11:48.539 --> 11:50.936
SY: Well, Christine had a flute. That will be good, I think.

11:51.137 --> 11:52.177
SM: Christine come along.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.595
SY: Mother, I didn't bring it.

11:54.796 --> 11:57.185
I didn't bring my instrument.

12:03.780 --> 12:05.757
SM: What is here?

12:05.958 --> 12:08.617
[You all are good]. You are all going to sing, all right?

12:08.818 --> 12:11.058
SY: We can do the whole...

12:11.259 --> 12:14.374
"He's got the hole world in...", "She's got the hole world in Her..."

12:17.354 --> 12:19.369
SM: Come along with it. What is it?

12:19.570 --> 12:21.909
SY: That one that they sang for you in New York, Mother: "She's got the whole world...

12:22.110 --> 12:23.909
SM: Yes, all of you, come along, join them.

12:24.110 --> 12:28.970
Hello, come here! All of you. Come along!

12:32.274 --> 12:34.231
Sit down.

12:35.570 --> 12:38.522
Come, come!

12:54.433 --> 12:57.045
Call all the children!

13:08.245 --> 13:10.474
Where are they gone?

13:17.269 --> 13:19.942
SY: Oh yes, Christine, you should sing, too.

13:22.409 --> 13:24.724
SM: Which one? [Poppin?]

13:24.925 --> 13:26.651
SY: No, Christine.

13:26.852 --> 13:29.899
Come up here Christine, come on! SM: Come along, come along!

13:38.021 --> 13:40.480
Where is My purse?

13:40.681 --> 13:43.675
SY: Christine has it.
SM: No, no, this you have it I think.

13:43.876 --> 13:46.924
Smaller one, please. I just need my handkerchief.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.607
Yes!

14:05.089 --> 14:08.540
Gregoire is going to sing.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.223
SY: Too high?

14:24.424 --> 14:26.760
SM: Natany you also sing?
SY: Oh, yes.

14:29.228 --> 14:31.844
SM: You represent the whole of Italy here, you know?

14:34.632 --> 14:36.363
No italian has come, so you are the one

14:36.564 --> 14:38.805
representing the whole of Italy.

14:42.093 --> 14:44.260
Ruth has written a letter of great apologies

14:44.461 --> 14:46.228
that she's the one who could not come,

14:46.429 --> 14:49.044
from Italy, so now we have [Sawan].

14:56.061 --> 14:59.321
Loudspeaker you can connect. It's better?

17:38.578 --> 17:40.788
SM: Beautiful.

17:40.989 --> 17:42.230
Beautiful.

SM: It's all right, you stay here. SY: I don't want.

18:52.962 --> 18:54.977
[Send the car].

19:03.244 --> 19:05.958
May God bless you!

19:27.696 --> 19:29.948

19:40.727 --> 19:42.233
SY: Yeah.

21:14.867 --> 21:17.104
SY: Why don't you ask Antonio play the cord?

21:17.305 --> 21:20.227
I think you may be able to play the cord and, and keep the rhythm.

21:20.428 --> 21:22.992
Why don't you go over with the song?

21:33.460 --> 21:35.666
SM - [unclear] It's good.

21:38.126 --> 21:39.785

Hold your breathe [unclear].

26:05.950 --> 26:07.170
SM: All right.
SY: song.

26:07.380 --> 26:08.800
Prepared somewhat for You.

26:08.980 --> 26:11.840
SM: Thank you very much for playing the piano so well.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.900
Mother, we'd like to sing a song

26:33.108 --> 26:35.110
which I think a lot of people probably know

26:35.311 --> 26:38.687
so they should joint in, because we probably don't know it so well.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.055
SM: All right.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.571
SY: We could, we could sing

26:43.772 --> 26:45.849
Oh, when the saints go marching in, after all.

26:52.057 --> 26:54.211
SM: [unclear].

26:54.412 --> 26:56.092
SY: Well, this will do, anyway.

26:56.293 --> 26:59.029
SM: That one from William Blake?

27:01.270 --> 27:03.470
Jerusalem.

27:25.356 --> 27:27.076
Vivid you also sing?

27:27.277 --> 27:29.303
Come along, join them.

27:29.504 --> 27:30.663
Come along.

27:30.864 --> 27:33.212
Christine is very good. Christine has a good voice.

27:33.420 --> 27:36.920
Christine, come along. She has a very beautiful... After Realization

27:37.120 --> 27:40.180
her voice became so melodious [unclear].

27:40.380 --> 27:43.360
Otherwise she was... no good.

27:47.863 --> 27:50.350
That's a fact.

27:54.076 --> 27:55.861
What about you, [Fritz]? Play that.

27:56.062 --> 27:57.674
SY: Mother, I will do...

27:57.875 --> 28:00.802
SM: Why not try? Yes, try.

28:01.003 --> 28:04.301
You must play in My presence so you'll play very well later on.

28:04.502 --> 28:07.072
All right? That's a promise.

28:08.486 --> 28:10.938
That's a promise to you also.

28:29.644 --> 28:32.736
SY: We could sing the song of fewer words...

28:51.164 --> 28:54.278
SM: What about... Esther, you also sing.

28:54.479 --> 28:57.037
All of you who sing should come forward.

31:48.442 --> 31:54.141
SY: Do you know the song, "You are my Father, You are my Mother?

31:54.342 --> 31:58.111
SY: No, sorry.

31:58.721 --> 32:00.784
SY: You are my Father, You are my Mother

32:00.985 --> 32:02.985
You are my God, You are my friend, [unclear]

32:24.300 --> 32:25.823
SY: That's it!

35:52.736 --> 35:54.702
SY : Nancy has a song, Mother.

35:56.367 --> 35:58.755
SY: I don't want to play...

35:58.956 --> 36:01.238
This is from...

36:01.439 --> 36:06.831
a play that started years ago. It's called...

36:08.527 --> 36:09.527
God's spell.

36:11.880 --> 36:12.942
SY: God's spell.

36:13.143 --> 36:15.012
SY: God's spell.

36:15.213 --> 36:17.113
SY: You probably have renamed it Nirmala.

36:17.314 --> 36:18.315
It's a musical...

36:18.516 --> 36:21.188
SY: God's spell. The spell of God.

36:21.389 --> 36:23.034
SY: I love that one.

36:23.235 --> 36:24.304
SY: Yes, everybody.

36:24.505 --> 36:27.319

38:53.243 --> 38:58.097
SM: Does he see? Does he see? The little one, does he see?

39:05.110 --> 39:06.110
No?

39:09.056 --> 39:10.228
Which other song you know?

39:10.444 --> 39:14.481
Your father is a great singer. What about you having another song?

39:14.682 --> 39:15.682
C: I don't know.

39:15.883 --> 39:19.136
SM: Don't know any? Your father didn't teach you any song?

39:27.292 --> 39:28.292
Now, wich one now?

39:28.493 --> 39:31.461
SY: And doctor Worlikar?

56:49.754 --> 56:51.859
in the, in the house

56:52.060 --> 56:55.183
of the Nath, means the primordial master,

56:55.384 --> 56:59.105
is dancing Shri Krishna.

56:59.928 --> 57:01.766
Pandurang is Shri Krishna

57:01.967 --> 57:04.954

57:05.565 --> 57:09.792
simple people entering inside the house,

57:09.993 --> 57:12.261
only at the,

57:23.504 --> 57:26.374
Threshold, on the threshold of the house.

57:26.575 --> 57:28.176
We just get so detached,

57:28.377 --> 57:30.840
that we start dancing there at the threshold only,

57:31.041 --> 57:33.395
because we are...

57:33.596 --> 57:35.707
not able to see them.

57:35.900 --> 57:39.800
Is that's how it is, all the description of the dance.

57:40.420 --> 57:41.760

57:41.840 --> 57:44.420

57:44.626 --> 57:46.343
Nira river, where I have

57:46.544 --> 57:48.536
taken the land for you, people,

57:48.737 --> 57:50.507
that meets the Bhima river,

57:50.731 --> 57:55.080

57:55.281 --> 57:59.967
And then they go, and then they go to,

58:00.168 --> 58:02.671
Chandrabhaga goes to Pandharpur

58:17.944 --> 58:20.133
we take our bath,

58:20.334 --> 58:22.738
when the dance is on, we are taking our bath,

58:22.939 --> 58:24.706
and we are singing and enjoying ourselves

58:24.907 --> 58:28.374
when the dance is on in the house of the Primordial Master.

58:28.575 --> 58:31.567
Is a very good combination of the Primordial Master

58:31.768 --> 58:32.985

The marathi writter Gudi Madgulkar wrote

01:04:03.686 --> 01:04:06.427
a Geet Ramayan - the Ramayan was written

01:04:06.628 --> 01:04:10.582
in the form of songs and this is one of the songs when

01:04:10.783 --> 01:04:15.320
Bharat goes to Lord Rama and request Him to come back

01:04:15.521 --> 01:04:20.538
and Sita on the, on the throne, called throne,

01:04:20.739 --> 01:04:23.860
and Rama has gone for one last fourteen years

01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:25.694
and He cannot come back,

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:27.992
so He, He gives him

01:04:28.193 --> 01:04:31.581
a farewell at the, at the bank of the river Ganges,

01:04:31.782 --> 01:04:36.282
with the tears in His eyes, and He, He explain to Bharat

01:04:36.483 --> 01:04:41.372
how much valuable it is to touch the feet of your own, own father.

01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:44.722
I mean, in our Indian customary

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:47.913
we fall at the feet of mother and father -

01:04:48.114 --> 01:04:50.013
we consider them like Gods.

01:04:50.214 --> 01:04:53.294
So He explains - that's the entire meaning of it.

01:04:53.502 --> 01:04:56.568
SM: Means to follow the father desire, you see?

01:04:56.769 --> 01:04:59.435
SY: Right, yes.

01:07:50.462 --> 01:07:51.494
SM: Beautiful.

01:07:51.695 --> 01:07:54.094
SY: [hindhi/marathi].

01:07:54.295 --> 01:07:56.089
[hindhi/marathi].
SM - [hindhi/marathi].

01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:58.387
SM: [hindhi/marathi].

01:07:58.588 --> 01:08:00.549
[hindhi/marathi]

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:03.753
SY: [hindhi/marathi].
SM: You should sing one...

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:06.380
Now, your Jerusalem,

01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:08.867
and then aarti... What else?

01:08:09.104 --> 01:08:10.944
Last, aarti.

01:08:11.145 --> 01:08:12.598
SY: Aarti last.

01:08:12.799 --> 01:08:13.799
SY: Aarti the last.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.265
SM: Aarti the last. So first you sing your songs.

01:08:17.466 --> 01:08:21.200
SY: We shall sing "Saints", yes.
SY: Mother, we'll try something.

01:08:21.401 --> 01:08:22.971
first - before Jerusalem.

01:08:23.172 --> 01:08:26.066
Where is...? Clement?
SY: Yes.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.920
SY: Why don't we sing "When the saints go marching in"? That's it.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.100
SY: I don't know that. SY: You don't know it?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.080
SY: If everybody else does, he'll know.

01:08:40.822 --> 01:08:45.521
Mother, the text is: "Oh, when the saints go marching in,

01:08:45.722 --> 01:08:48.647
I shall be one among them -

01:08:48.848 --> 01:08:52.189
I want to be one among them."

01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:39.787
SM: Now, which one is next?

01:10:39.988 --> 01:10:41.355
SY: I can sing a song.

01:10:41.556 --> 01:10:42.859
SM: Yes, go ahead, go ahead!

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.282
SY: Yes, go ahead!

01:10:44.483 --> 01:10:47.597
SY: You see, I know so many songs but none of them us really...

01:10:47.798 --> 01:10:51.279
They are all...

01:10:54.466 --> 01:10:56.645
SY: Is better be good that one.

01:10:59.363 --> 01:11:01.150
SY: Next time you come for meeting,

01:11:01.351 --> 01:11:05.276
get prepared with an Indian song.

01:11:05.477 --> 01:11:07.167
SY: You'll have to sing, not of the...

01:11:07.368 --> 01:11:10.682
SY: [I'll try] anyway. It's a love song, love song.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.487
SY: Good!

01:14:33.704 --> 01:14:35.212
SY: Very good!

01:14:37.645 --> 01:14:40.013
SM: They don't understand Italian. Let him translate.

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:42.280
SY: Translate to Mother.
SY: Oh, yes, translate.

01:14:42.481 --> 01:14:44.181
SM: Gregoire, come on.

01:14:44.382 --> 01:14:47.585
SY: I don't, I don't think, Mother I [can do it].

01:14:47.786 --> 01:14:49.445
SM: Why? Why can't you?

01:14:49.646 --> 01:14:52.014
SY: I, I, I don't think I follow the whole of this, Mother.

01:14:52.215 --> 01:14:53.630
SM: You don't follow?

01:14:53.831 --> 01:14:56.740
SY: I, I think it's all right, Mother, the music is very [deep].

01:14:59.379 --> 01:15:00.372
SY: Melodious.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.631
SM: You are supposed to be a master of Italian language.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.298
SY: Yes, but [that song because it's melodious].

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.580
SY: Since it's [unclear].

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.920
SY: He sings very well.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.060
SM: What was it about?

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.980
SY: That's what I'm doing.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:19.850
SY: It's a love song over, over...

01:15:20.051 --> 01:15:22.569
SM: I could see that.

01:15:26.423 --> 01:15:29.273
It's over a man that could not reach his beloved.

01:15:29.478 --> 01:15:31.797
and so he sings that he's in

01:15:31.998 --> 01:15:35.520
in darkness, but that with a talk of his beloved

01:15:35.721 --> 01:15:40.200
he can sleep even out in the night.

01:15:40.401 --> 01:15:42.219
SM: But that could be a pray to God also.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.330
SY: Yes, because I thought

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.880
he's singing [unclear] but as a grandchildren [unclear].

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.960
SM: Good ideea.

01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:55.946
All My grandchildren want to marry Me, you'll be suprised.

01:15:59.399 --> 01:16:01.386
SY: We can do one song more

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:04.740
SM: All right, come along.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.880
This one is called "Lay Down Your Burden" and it was written by...

01:16:10.088 --> 01:16:12.689
Susan Osborn. She sings with Paul Winter Consort.

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:16.860
SY: Yes, hold the mike in your hand so you can...

01:16:17.061 --> 01:16:18.659
Yeah. Here, so he...

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.718
It's alright.

01:16:20.919 --> 01:16:22.571
Come here if you want.

01:16:22.772 --> 01:16:24.822
So he could tip you.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.540
SY: OK.
SY: All right. Yeah.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.560
SY: I just sing, I just sing one line, Mother, may I?

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.760
SY: What? SY: Are you sure?
SY: Just one line.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.772
SM: You will sing? Only one line.

01:19:07.973 --> 01:19:09.460
SY: Yes.
SM: Why?

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.620
SY: Because is only one line song.

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:30.020
So Jerusalem you can sing now.

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.380
Why?

01:20:33.906 --> 01:20:35.679
You have a common music thing,

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.871
where is, what has happen to that we have?

01:20:38.072 --> 01:20:39.814
A big...

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:44.501
people, we had in London,

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:48.026
where Patricia is to play?

01:20:48.227 --> 01:20:50.129
SY: Mother, could we sing more [unclear]

01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:51.767
you liked us so much in India.

01:20:51.968 --> 01:20:53.278
SY: But we don't know it all.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.200
SY: I know it. Brian knows it.
SY: No, he doesn't.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.620
What she wants to sing?

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.180
SY: OK, then you sing it.

01:21:15.588 --> 01:21:18.667
SY: Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

01:21:18.868 --> 01:21:21.764
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:24.670
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:28.209
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:31.457
I danced in the morning when the world was begun,

01:21:31.658 --> 01:21:34.515
I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,

01:21:34.716 --> 01:21:37.821
I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth.

01:21:38.022 --> 01:21:41.382
At Bethlehem I had My birth.

01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:44.658
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

01:21:44.859 --> 01:21:47.732
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

01:21:47.933 --> 01:21:50.865
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

01:21:51.066 --> 01:21:54.185
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

01:21:54.386 --> 01:21:57.539
I danced for the scribes and the Pharisees,

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.087
But they would not dance and they would not follow me,

01:22:01.288 --> 01:22:04.581
I danced for the fishermen, for James and John,

01:22:04.782 --> 01:22:07.998
They came to Me and the dance went on.

01:22:08.199 --> 01:22:11.125
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:14.335
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

01:22:14.536 --> 01:22:17.423
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

01:22:17.624 --> 01:22:21.030
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

01:22:21.231 --> 01:22:24.516
I dance in the morning when the sky turns black,

01:22:24.717 --> 01:22:27.709
Is hard to dance with the devil on your back

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:31.153
They burried my body and they thought I'm gone,

01:22:31.354 --> 01:22:34.579
But I'm the Lord of the dance and I still go on.

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.912
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

01:22:38.113 --> 01:22:40.925
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

01:22:41.126 --> 01:22:44.077
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

01:22:44.278 --> 01:22:47.759
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.084
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

01:22:51.285 --> 01:22:54.013
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

01:22:54.214 --> 01:22:57.282
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

01:22:57.483 --> 01:23:01.647
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

01:23:08.862 --> 01:23:10.583
Next time Mother, we'll have the sheets

01:23:10.784 --> 01:23:13.529
with all these [bhajans], next time we ever gather together.

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:15.187
SY: We'll all sing together.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.760
SY: We'll all know the words.

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.600
SM: Let us, let us, as singing this songs

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:23.980
think of the Heavens also.

01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:26.538
I don't know what's going to happen

01:23:26.739 --> 01:23:28.673
if you all

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:31.409
so powerful you're singing all these songs.

01:23:36.651 --> 01:23:38.651
God save America.

01:23:45.242 --> 01:23:48.116
Then all the false gurus

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:53.525
they will be backing off with their [unclear]

01:23:56.043 --> 01:23:58.826
and will be getting out, out of New York.

01:23:59.027 --> 01:24:01.699
There might be a general exodus.

01:24:04.192 --> 01:24:05.668
SY: Shri Mataji in,

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:08.818
I don't know whether is beeing written in India or in Europe

01:24:09.019 --> 01:24:12.439
or maybe both, but I think in India they've written a new

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.662
aarti for You.

01:24:13.863 --> 01:24:15.487
SM: Is it so?

01:24:15.688 --> 01:24:17.982
SY: And obiouvsly for the verse, I don't,

01:24:18.183 --> 01:24:20.498
I will sing of chorus, but I don't know the verses yet,

01:24:20.699 --> 01:24:21.827
because is brand new one.

01:24:22.028 --> 01:24:25.358
It's, it's the same as Sab.ko dua dena but it's a little... It's a new one.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.680
SY: Warming, warning [unclear].
SM: So let's have it!

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.400
SM: Wow, beautiful.

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:56.800
SY: So shall we sing it together?

01:24:57.005 --> 01:24:58.634
SY: Just sing it over there?
SY: Right!

01:24:58.835 --> 01:25:00.809
SY: Jay, jay Nirmala Ma,
Jay Nirmala Ma,

01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:03.192
Adi Shakti Mataji,

01:25:03.393 --> 01:25:06.213
Moksha pradayni Ma,
Jay, jay Nirmala Ma.

01:25:06.414 --> 01:25:08.192
SM: Moksha pradayni - the giver of the

01:25:08.393 --> 01:25:11.056
moksha, of the liberation.

01:25:37.792 --> 01:25:39.792
SY - Let's, let's do it without...

01:25:39.993 --> 01:25:41.472
don't take it to long.

01:26:31.956 --> 01:26:33.480
SM: Beautiful. Who has done that?

01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:35.825
SY: I think it might be Moreshwar, Mother.

01:26:36.026 --> 01:26:37.790
SY: But it has the whole seven verses
SM: Finished?

01:26:37.991 --> 01:26:40.337
SY: Seven verses. That's only in the [unclear].

01:26:40.553 --> 01:26:42.944
SY: If he'll transfer, already in the first they'll jump the gun

01:26:43.145 --> 01:26:44.193
and then they gather together.

01:26:44.394 --> 01:26:46.911
SM: Oh, they sing Marathi ones very well.

01:26:47.112 --> 01:26:49.885
Yes, France people. Nobody has come from France.

01:26:50.087 --> 01:26:53.975
The ways they are now becoming experts in Marathi music.

01:26:54.176 --> 01:26:57.132
SY: Yes?
SM: Oh, waw, waw!

01:26:57.333 --> 01:26:59.494
Aamhi Bhi Ghadalo Tumi Bhi Ghadana.

01:26:59.695 --> 01:27:01.681
SY: That's nice.
SY: Yes. Can we sing it now to you Mother?

01:27:02.131 --> 01:27:05.594

01:27:05.795 --> 01:27:07.295
SY: What's they sing?

01:27:07.496 --> 01:27:09.310
SY: What? What?

01:27:19.554 --> 01:27:21.220
They all sing in group.

01:27:24.835 --> 01:27:28.218
SM: Matajinchya sange mule bi ghadali

01:27:41.635 --> 01:27:45.860
I used to sing a lot but I've given My throat to the

01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:47.403
talking, I think.

01:27:47.604 --> 01:27:49.818
SY: Mother, I'd like to sing you a song that...

01:27:50.019 --> 01:27:51.556
SM: You would?
SY: Yes, he is..

01:27:51.757 --> 01:27:52.937
SM: That's great!
SY: I was,

01:27:53.138 --> 01:27:55.501
I was little worried because I feel that my Vishuddhi

01:27:55.702 --> 01:27:57.409
has been clearing out too quickly today. I'll do the best I can.

01:27:57.610 --> 01:28:00.526
SM: All right. You sing I'll give you a very good Vishuddhi, all right?

01:28:00.727 --> 01:28:03.198
That's the present.

01:28:03.399 --> 01:28:07.845
SY: This is a song I wrote. It's about, about weddings and

01:28:08.046 --> 01:28:09.753
how I feel about marriage.

01:28:09.954 --> 01:28:11.444
And I wrote up on my own marriage,

01:28:11.645 --> 01:28:13.596
and I feel it applies for all weddings and...

01:28:13.797 --> 01:28:16.208
SM: That's great. Good celebration.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.560
SM: Very good. Now  your voice is good?

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:11.580
You must put some heated butter

01:33:11.785 --> 01:33:13.752
in the nose, all of you.

01:33:13.953 --> 01:33:15.688
SY: In the... inside?
SM: Inside.

01:33:15.889 --> 01:33:17.992
With a, with a dropper, all right?

01:33:18.193 --> 01:33:20.773
Heat, heat butter and sieve it out.

01:33:20.974 --> 01:33:23.956
And then, when it is slightly warm, not very warm,

01:33:24.157 --> 01:33:27.539
absolutely slightly warm, then put it in Vishuddhi. It's very important.

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:31.031
Because the, I don't know in this country people,

01:33:31.232 --> 01:33:33.309
is a very simple thing to be done.

01:33:34.003 --> 01:33:37.123
Once in a while, about say, two-three days later or

01:33:37.324 --> 01:33:39.052
even every day, doesn't matter.

01:33:39.253 --> 01:33:42.942
It's like putting cream on your hands, you see, because

01:33:43.143 --> 01:33:46.853
the cold weather, also chops inside the lining

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:51.906
of the nose and when you put this it makes a...

01:33:52.499 --> 01:33:57.988
nose smooth, and you don't get troubles of it. It's very simple.

01:33:58.189 --> 01:34:00.940
All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis are supposed to do.

01:34:01.141 --> 01:34:03.514
There are so many things sahaja yogi that suppose to do -

01:34:03.715 --> 01:34:04.722
one of them is this -

01:34:04.923 --> 01:34:07.915
that try to keep your Hamsa chakra all right.

01:34:08.116 --> 01:34:11.854
By keeping your nose all right, you keep your Hamsa chakra better.

01:34:12.055 --> 01:34:14.720
So, better use this

01:34:14.921 --> 01:34:16.048
simple method

01:34:16.249 --> 01:34:19.504
of heating some ghee, we call it. You see, you can prepare it

01:34:19.705 --> 01:34:23.842
heated butter, keep it in a bottle with a

01:34:24.053 --> 01:34:26.570
dropper and heat it in the hot water.

01:34:26.771 --> 01:34:30.608
And then put it in the nose. Just like that,

01:34:30.809 --> 01:34:33.116
in the night, before sleeping.

01:34:33.317 --> 01:34:37.070
Even in the ears, you must put olive oil - is very important.

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:40.932
For the teeth also, you must take some salt,

01:34:41.133 --> 01:34:43.990
put some olive oil, and rub your gums.

01:34:44.191 --> 01:34:47.675
With that, you wont have to go to the dentist anymore.

01:34:47.876 --> 01:34:50.264
That's the best. I've never been to a dentist all My life

01:34:50.465 --> 01:34:52.745
and I don't want you to go to dentist anymore.

01:34:52.946 --> 01:34:55.680
So that's a very good way of rubbing your gums

01:34:55.881 --> 01:35:01.016
with vibrated salt and what you call, the olive oil.

01:35:01.217 --> 01:35:03.242
Also you must oil your heads,

01:35:03.443 --> 01:35:07.351
every Saturday, with so much of oil, nicely.

01:35:07.552 --> 01:35:09.452
Oil it, massage you head

01:35:09.661 --> 01:35:12.095
and sleep off and next day wash off your head.

01:35:12.296 --> 01:35:13.760
You feel very much better.

01:35:13.961 --> 01:35:15.395
If any of you cannot get olive oil,

01:35:15.596 --> 01:35:17.577
the best is almond oil for the head.

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.218
Keeps you very peaceful.

01:35:19.419 --> 01:35:21.473
Especially your children, you must massage them

01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:23.054
till they are five years of age,

01:35:23.319 --> 01:35:26.594
every night, when they go off to sleep, in the night.

01:35:26.795 --> 01:35:31.646
Nicely, very, for before sleep. And then put some powder

01:35:31.847 --> 01:35:33.402
clean it out and let them sleep.

01:35:33.603 --> 01:35:36.268
Then the children won't be running and upset and all that.

01:35:36.469 --> 01:35:39.304
They'll become very quiet children, well behave children.

01:35:39.505 --> 01:35:41.454
Because you people don't massage the children

01:35:41.655 --> 01:35:43.361
all their lifes they are jumping.

01:35:43.562 --> 01:35:45.663
And all their lives, they're likely violent.

01:35:45.864 --> 01:35:48.417
You see, this is the nerves must be soothed down.

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:50.784
A very simple method and as you are

01:35:50.985 --> 01:35:53.628
realised people you sooth them much more.

01:35:53.829 --> 01:35:57.268
All these small, small things must be taken care of, you see.

01:35:57.469 --> 01:36:00.677
Now if you have too much of cold,

01:36:00.878 --> 01:36:02.411
if you have too much of cold,

01:36:02.612 --> 01:36:06.703
then you can mix up little camphor, with oil

01:36:06.904 --> 01:36:09.815
and put that in the nose - little I said, not much.

01:36:10.016 --> 01:36:11.293
That also is very good.

01:36:11.494 --> 01:36:14.404
That also soothes your cold and puts you right.

01:36:14.605 --> 01:36:17.612
This country has one big problem: is Vishuddhi chakra everywhere

01:36:17.813 --> 01:36:19.958
in the West - because of the cold.

01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:22.370
And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory

01:36:22.571 --> 01:36:24.561
that you must wear an undershirt.

01:36:24.762 --> 01:36:26.457
It is compulsory.

01:36:26.658 --> 01:36:29.155
Whatever may be - it is hot, cold, anything.

01:36:29.356 --> 01:36:33.038
In India even when extremely hot, you must wear an undershirt

01:36:33.239 --> 01:36:37.120
because when it is very hot you start perspiring

01:36:37.321 --> 01:36:40.342
and that perspiration causes problems.

01:36:40.543 --> 01:36:43.260
So, always wear an undershirt

01:36:43.461 --> 01:36:46.408
whether you are in a hot season or a cold season.

01:36:46.609 --> 01:36:50.204
That's a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis, that they must wear.

01:36:50.405 --> 01:36:53.286
And for all of them also is compulsory

01:36:53.487 --> 01:36:56.156
that they should always wear a muffler

01:36:56.357 --> 01:36:58.568
when they go out during winter time -

01:36:58.769 --> 01:37:02.879
it is an important thing. And also put some these

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.401
cotton wools in the ears, as I put it.

01:37:06.602 --> 01:37:09.493
For your sake I have to put it, because you are careless.

01:37:09.694 --> 01:37:12.874
So I look after you by putting into My ears like this.

01:37:13.075 --> 01:37:15.183
So you all should put it before going out.

01:37:15.384 --> 01:37:19.893
And keep your head covered in the night - when you sleep

01:37:20.094 --> 01:37:22.094
cover your head with something and then sleep.

01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:23.396
Because most of the time

01:37:23.597 --> 01:37:25.894
your body is all covered but the head is not covered.

01:37:26.095 --> 01:37:29.754
Because now you are realized souls, and your Sahasrara is weak.

01:37:29.955 --> 01:37:31.842
So you must look after your Sahasrara.

01:37:32.043 --> 01:37:35.582
Cover you head, so that you won't have any problem.

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:39.180
Also you must verify what sort of a person you are.

01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:42.851
If you have a liver problem, then you get a diet for that,

01:37:43.052 --> 01:37:45.043
which is here - people will tell you.

01:37:45.244 --> 01:37:48.974
If you left sided person, if you have left sided problem

01:37:49.175 --> 01:37:51.813
then you must know about the diet - what you have to take.

01:37:52.014 --> 01:37:53.772
For example a person who's a left sided

01:37:53.973 --> 01:37:55.815
should not taken carbohydrates at all.

01:37:56.016 --> 01:37:59.294
On the contrary, should eat proteins in whatever form it is possible.

01:37:59.579 --> 01:38:00.682
In Sahaja Yoga, you know,

01:38:00.883 --> 01:38:02.793
we don't believe in vegetarianism or anything

01:38:02.994 --> 01:38:05.747
but we do believe that the

01:38:06.338 --> 01:38:10.973
muscles of the bigger animals than us are not god for our teeth,

01:38:11.174 --> 01:38:13.720
or for our body also because the

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:16.768
structure of a muscular cell of a biger animal

01:38:16.969 --> 01:38:18.786
is much bigger then ours.

01:38:18.987 --> 01:38:21.048
And that's how they eat up. I mean

01:38:21.264 --> 01:38:25.254
even by mistake if I eat something or anybody asked Me the other day -

01:38:25.455 --> 01:38:27.679
behind My teeth were swollen up.

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:30.987
So that's what it happens. It is an automatic reaction.

01:38:31.188 --> 01:38:34.621
And we are not supposed to use plastics

01:38:34.822 --> 01:38:36.924
in our

01:38:37.551 --> 01:38:39.432
clothes. Also try to avoid -

01:38:39.633 --> 01:38:42.228
some percentage of plastic we may use, but not

01:38:42.429 --> 01:38:44.724
all time plastics and nylons.

01:38:44.925 --> 01:38:47.780
And also the food should not be eaten in plastics.

01:38:47.981 --> 01:38:52.195
You can eat it in paper - paper is all right, because it is -

01:38:52.396 --> 01:38:55.245
what you call - is good, does't matter.

01:38:55.526 --> 01:38:59.335
But you shouldn't eat in plastic, food, plastic with

01:38:59.536 --> 01:39:01.744
forks and spoons of plastic and...

01:39:01.945 --> 01:39:03.531
It's too much plastic in this country.

01:39:03.732 --> 01:39:05.680
So be careful because plastic is

01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:11.165
anti-God, it is anti-human life, it is anti-biological processes.

01:39:11.366 --> 01:39:14.093
So avoid plastics as far as possible.

01:39:14.294 --> 01:39:17.232
Be careful on that and also don't use

01:39:17.433 --> 01:39:19.574
made something out of absolute plastic.

01:39:19.791 --> 01:39:22.534
Like I've seen, I wanted to buy one pair of

01:39:22.735 --> 01:39:25.498
slippers for Myself - I couldn't get one

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:28.039
in the whole of Europe.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.621
Because I didn't want a plastic.

01:39:29.846 --> 01:39:31.514
And if you wear that, then you develop

01:39:31.715 --> 01:39:34.994
all kinds of skin troubles, skin diseases - so be careful on that.

01:39:35.294 --> 01:39:38.128
There are so many other things we are to be careful about,

01:39:38.329 --> 01:39:41.494
and because we have found out that these things that are harmful

01:39:41.695 --> 01:39:43.123
that's why we have made it compulsory:

01:39:43.324 --> 01:39:46.242
that everyone of you must be careful.

01:39:46.506 --> 01:39:49.027
Because now you are become the temple of God.

01:39:49.228 --> 01:39:53.084
And the temple of God should be healthy.

01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:56.399
We don't want tubercular patients

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.560
to go around as saints. Nobody is going to believe them.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.880
SY: You just tell them about sugar.

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:08.380
SM: Now there's another falsehood about - thank God is now broken -

01:40:08.579 --> 01:40:12.264
that the sugar is against our...

01:40:12.465 --> 01:40:15.617
growth and all that. Sugar is very important for attention.

01:40:15.818 --> 01:40:18.003
Especially people who suffer from liver.

01:40:18.204 --> 01:40:21.541
For example people who are thin, mostly suffer from liver trouble.

01:40:21.742 --> 01:40:26.378
For them sugar is so important that if they don't take sugar

01:40:26.579 --> 01:40:29.785
they'll become like the sugar cane which has

01:40:29.986 --> 01:40:31.426
come out of the

01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.340
machine, pressing machine, you see?

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.560
Better take some sugar.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.860
Sugar is very important for your liver.

01:40:39.069 --> 01:40:42.014
Best carbohydrate is white sugar, not the red sugar.

01:40:42.215 --> 01:40:45.959
Red sugar is not good because it has got molasses - it's very heating.

01:40:46.168 --> 01:40:48.689
Some people have funny ideas here

01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:52.413
also about food. Like some of them believe

01:40:52.614 --> 01:40:54.193
that if you eat natural food -

01:40:54.394 --> 01:40:56.590
once I got something from natural store

01:40:56.791 --> 01:40:58.507
and I got diarrhea for five days.

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:02.800
Because it was meant for animals not for the... human beings.

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.380
Like some people eat, what you call them, [hindhi/marathi],

01:41:07.568 --> 01:41:08.667
Cotton seed!

01:41:08.868 --> 01:41:11.191
Now, cotton seed we give only to animals,

01:41:11.392 --> 01:41:14.104
you can't believe even. But I've seen in Switzerland,

01:41:14.305 --> 01:41:16.533
they give cotton seed in the bread.

01:41:16.734 --> 01:41:19.017
There was cotton seed in the bread. One or two is all right,

01:41:19.218 --> 01:41:21.808
but imagine, [hindhi/marathi].

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:25.530
[hindhi/marathi]. We can give it to buffaloes only.

01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:28.252
And that was given and you get diarrhea with it.

01:41:28.453 --> 01:41:29.958
You see, this's a very strong things.

01:41:30.159 --> 01:41:32.668
In the same way very soft food is also not good.

01:41:32.874 --> 01:41:34.701
We have to be in the centre in everything.

01:41:34.902 --> 01:41:37.048
Don't eat very rough food, you see like...

01:41:37.249 --> 01:41:40.855
some of the bread in France, you know, even in England we find,

01:41:41.056 --> 01:41:43.803
it breaks your gums completely.

01:41:44.004 --> 01:41:46.480
So that kind of a crispy stuff not need it.

01:41:46.681 --> 01:41:49.173
It should be such that your gums are

01:41:49.374 --> 01:41:51.544
looked after - they are delicate things

01:41:51.745 --> 01:41:56.566
and have food which is good for you.

01:41:56.767 --> 01:41:59.805
Don't go with nationality, don't go with the fashion

01:42:00.006 --> 01:42:02.408
but whatever is good for you that should be done.

01:42:02.609 --> 01:42:05.605
And you find out about yourself, what is your temperament,

01:42:05.806 --> 01:42:08.595
what sort of a food will soothe you

01:42:08.796 --> 01:42:10.515
and accordingly you should eat.

01:42:10.716 --> 01:42:13.692
Of course, everybody is free to do what they like

01:42:13.893 --> 01:42:16.089
but we can only advice them that this will soothe you,

01:42:16.290 --> 01:42:19.445
and you'll find it will be very helpful to all of you.

01:42:19.646 --> 01:42:20.646
It will help you.

01:42:20.847 --> 01:42:24.606
For you hair growth, also you should get vibrated

01:42:24.807 --> 01:42:26.568
oil and use it. Now,

01:42:26.769 --> 01:42:29.340
you'll be surprised the other day somebody saw Warren and he said,

01:42:29.541 --> 01:42:31.437
"This is the same fellow? Looks much younger.

01:42:31.667 --> 01:42:34.814
So I said, "Yes, he had a baldness from here to here, like that.

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:36.568
And now he's grown hair.

01:42:36.769 --> 01:42:39.670
With proper care, you can have your hair

01:42:39.871 --> 01:42:43.938
quite intact for quite sometime - if you look after your hair.

01:42:44.139 --> 01:42:46.836
But hair is why important, is not so much look,

01:42:47.037 --> 01:42:48.778
but the Sahasrara.

01:42:48.979 --> 01:42:53.520
And if you put oil in your Sahasrara every week,

01:42:53.721 --> 01:42:56.759
you will have a smoothe personality,

01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.709
a smooth behavior, a smooth movement,

01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:04.462
you'll deal with other people in a gentle manner.

01:43:04.663 --> 01:43:08.393
So this is very necessary. In India we actually have a big

01:43:08.594 --> 01:43:12.548
masseur attached to a family, see - is a very hefty fellow.

01:43:12.749 --> 01:43:15.346
And he comes to massage the men, you see, he just

01:43:15.547 --> 01:43:16.547
sits on their body

01:43:16.748 --> 01:43:19.677
and really finishes them off completely.

01:43:21.199 --> 01:43:22.813
At the first shot they are dead.

01:43:23.014 --> 01:43:26.823
Then he uses their body fully and push it and sits on them

01:43:27.024 --> 01:43:29.219
and rubs them. With the, one clap - you see,

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:32.062
five, six of them will be jumping on five, six people -

01:43:32.263 --> 01:43:34.784
with clap, they'll go round. By the time the second job comes in

01:43:34.985 --> 01:43:36.829
the person is finished.

01:43:37.630 --> 01:43:38.637
That's how they manage.

01:43:38.838 --> 01:43:41.716
But that, there's no importance of massaging here, you see.

01:43:41.917 --> 01:43:45.561
And don't ask a nonsahaja yogi to massage you. Never.

01:43:45.762 --> 01:43:48.419
Don't allow anybody to touch you that way.

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.458
Because, you see, these people carry

01:43:50.659 --> 01:43:53.708
all bad vibrations and you may suffer.

01:43:53.909 --> 01:43:58.963
You must allow only the realized souls to massage you, if possible,

01:43:59.164 --> 01:44:01.368
or you, yourself should massage yourself.

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:04.672
But don't go to this masseurs and people

01:44:04.873 --> 01:44:06.540
who are massaging all kinds of people

01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:08.974
and they might be given you some troubles.

01:44:09.175 --> 01:44:12.480
So one has to be very careful about certain things and

01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:15.396
certain person habits also, which we have discussed.

01:44:15.597 --> 01:44:18.150
And you can ask Warren, he will tell you about it,

01:44:18.351 --> 01:44:21.123
which are very important for Mooladhara and all those things,

01:44:21.324 --> 01:44:22.783
which must be followed,

01:44:22.984 --> 01:44:24.590
whether you are in England, America, anywhere.

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:29.373
This must be followed to keep yourself clean outside and inside.

01:44:29.574 --> 01:44:32.214
Now, if you have any questions?

01:44:32.415 --> 01:44:34.279
SY: I was only wondering, Mataji,

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.214
any kind of technique that we should do

01:44:36.415 --> 01:44:38.288
when massaging the children?

01:44:38.489 --> 01:44:40.055
But I guess that [unclear].

01:44:40.256 --> 01:44:43.082
SM: I mean any way you use is all right, but always

01:44:43.283 --> 01:44:45.042
put it a upwards, you see,

01:44:45.243 --> 01:44:48.869
The movement should be upward but use oil, otherwise you

01:44:49.085 --> 01:44:52.752
pull out their hair. So use oil to put it up first.

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:54.403
SY: And don't forget the Sahasrara.

01:44:54.604 --> 01:44:57.221
SM: Sahasrara don't forget, Sahasrara you must put

01:44:57.422 --> 01:44:59.748
lot of oil on children.

01:44:59.949 --> 01:45:01.669
SY: Mother we gonna a need more

01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:05.306
hairdressers, people who can cut hair for us, realized souls,

01:45:05.507 --> 01:45:08.581
because they have us touching on our Sahasrara with the haircut.

01:45:08.782 --> 01:45:11.069
SM: Yes, otherwise you can grow, what's the harm?

01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:13.163
SY: We can grow our hair Mother?

01:45:13.364 --> 01:45:16.416
SM: Yes, here up to here you can grow and cut them round.

01:45:20.348 --> 01:45:24.031
See, you'll look like a philosopher, quite impressive.

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.978
But you should not be a funny looking person, or a jocular personality.

01:45:34.179 --> 01:45:36.310
That's one thing very important, you see,

01:45:36.511 --> 01:45:40.050
you have not to adopt some funny methods, you see,

01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:41.398
like people have.

01:45:41.599 --> 01:45:44.983
Especially nowadays the fashion is to dishevel you hair

01:45:45.184 --> 01:45:48.175
and keep them absolutely disheveled. There is no need to...

01:45:48.376 --> 01:45:49.982
SY: Tell them to keep the hair out of the [unclear].

01:45:50.183 --> 01:45:52.412
SY: The hair must be off the forehead.

01:45:52.613 --> 01:45:55.369
SM: Yes! Should be kept back over the forehead.

01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:57.688
Don't cover your forehead, or your eyes -

01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:00.020
- never. SY: And also the Agya chakra will stay back.

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.260
SM: Yes. You must keep it open, you see, always open.

01:46:03.468 --> 01:46:06.548
Parted. You must have a central part if is possible,

01:46:06.749 --> 01:46:09.582
but keep the forehead open - is important.

01:46:09.783 --> 01:46:13.057
Keep the forehead open - is very good for others, you see,

01:46:13.258 --> 01:46:17.057
and don't cover your eyes with any hair. Many people have a habit

01:46:17.258 --> 01:46:21.001
of allowing the hair to come on the eyes, and you'll have squints.

01:46:21.202 --> 01:46:25.221
Children also, never allow hair to come on their eyes.

01:46:25.771 --> 01:46:28.392
Then we have some things for the eyes also,

01:46:28.593 --> 01:46:31.265
what you call Neetranjan - I don't have now anything.

01:46:31.466 --> 01:46:34.418
But is a very good simple thing, cost you nothing, about

01:46:34.619 --> 01:46:37.584
[Neetranjan] is just ten-eleven rupee, meaning how much here?

01:46:38.163 --> 01:46:39.852
One tenth of a dollar.

01:46:40.053 --> 01:46:42.122
All right, they have some, they'll give you,

01:46:42.323 --> 01:46:45.555
each is to be applied first very carefully

01:46:47.011 --> 01:46:49.691
If you are not use to it, it will little bit burn and the tears

01:46:49.892 --> 01:46:52.536
will start coming out of your eyes. It will clear your eyes.

01:46:52.737 --> 01:46:54.732
And you'll be surprised with that, if you use it,

01:46:54.933 --> 01:46:57.153
you don't develop these bags and things like that.

01:46:57.354 --> 01:47:00.929
And the water close out - is very simple thing.

01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:03.955
And for soap also,

01:47:04.156 --> 01:47:06.886
try to use natural soaps.

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:08.100
Better is -

01:47:08.301 --> 01:47:11.998
because here the soaps are such, that I don't know what to say.

01:47:12.199 --> 01:47:13.632
SY: Palmolive, Mother.

01:47:13.833 --> 01:47:16.274
Palmolive I think is about the only soap you can get here.

01:47:16.475 --> 01:47:19.219
SM: Yes, that is good, Palmolive.

01:47:20.289 --> 01:47:22.289
It's very good.

01:47:31.853 --> 01:47:32.916
Now, what else?

01:47:33.117 --> 01:47:35.495
SY: Jerusalem.
SY: Mother, I have one question here.

01:47:35.696 --> 01:47:37.759
SM: Yes.
SY: Another question.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.714
SY: My son has [unclear]

01:47:40.915 --> 01:47:44.431
it's fluid in the ears.

01:47:45.437 --> 01:47:48.389
SY: Her son gets fluid in the ears. What can he do?
SM: All right, what you do

01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:50.977
it's to take a little oil

01:47:51.178 --> 01:47:55.623
and heat with some cloves.

01:47:55.824 --> 01:47:57.771
Cloves?

01:47:57.972 --> 01:47:59.375
SY: Cloves.
SM: Cloves, cloves.

01:47:59.576 --> 01:48:01.425
SY: No, cloves.
SM: Cloves.

01:48:01.626 --> 01:48:04.086
And let the oil be little bit

01:48:04.287 --> 01:48:07.531
cooled down. When is quite cooled down, not, should not be

01:48:07.732 --> 01:48:11.034
burning hot at all, but just warm - you can feel it -

01:48:11.235 --> 01:48:13.573
then put it in the ears.

01:48:13.774 --> 01:48:14.991
SY: Olive oil?

01:48:15.192 --> 01:48:17.637
SM: Olive oil is all right.

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.516
But do it quite often.

01:48:24.717 --> 01:48:27.954
So what happens, that the oil goes inside and the fluid comes out.

01:48:28.155 --> 01:48:29.676
SY: Mother, could you explain to them

01:48:29.877 --> 01:48:32.676
the significance of vibrated sugar and vibrated salt and

01:48:32.877 --> 01:48:34.497
that giving vibrations to these things.

01:48:34.698 --> 01:48:36.586
They don't quite understand the significance

01:48:36.787 --> 01:48:39.064
of vibrating everything.

01:48:39.265 --> 01:48:41.339
SM: You see, because God has given you vibrations,

01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:43.176
the power is flowing through you now.

01:48:43.377 --> 01:48:44.754
The vibrations are there.

01:48:44.964 --> 01:48:48.582
So whatever you get from outside is touched by so many people,

01:48:48.783 --> 01:48:51.562
so many people have created it and they haven't got

01:48:51.764 --> 01:48:53.653
a good mind or maybe something wrong with them.

01:48:53.854 --> 01:48:55.284
Best thing is to give them

01:48:55.485 --> 01:48:57.447
a bandhan before eating. Any food you eat,

01:48:57.648 --> 01:48:59.852
you must give the bandhan like this, three times,

01:49:00.053 --> 01:49:04.135
so your vibrations flow into the food and you get it sanctified.

01:49:04.336 --> 01:49:07.011
Or else, you can also

01:49:07.212 --> 01:49:11.018
use your hands for eating. If you have washed your hands then it's all right.

01:49:11.219 --> 01:49:14.668
Or else, if you are taking the water, you can just

01:49:14.869 --> 01:49:17.590
put your hands - then it gets vibrated, then drink it.

01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:19.493
Because, the thing is,

01:49:19.694 --> 01:49:21.906
the vibrations have starting flowing through your hands

01:49:22.107 --> 01:49:25.349
but still have not spread to your body fully.

01:49:29.311 --> 01:49:31.786
SY: When you are vibrating food, you can actually feel

01:49:31.987 --> 01:49:35.587
hot food emitting a cool breeze - it's quite remarkable.

01:49:35.788 --> 01:49:39.935
SM: Even, even you'll find cool breeze from a candle.

01:49:40.404 --> 01:49:41.800
SY: What's this? It's water or what?

01:49:42.001 --> 01:49:44.672
SY - Yeah, water, and the other one is [unclear].

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.500
SY: [hindhi/marathi].
SM: What is this?

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:47.580
SY: It's water.

01:49:47.772 --> 01:49:49.268
SM: Is it cold.
SY: Yes, it's cold.

01:49:49.469 --> 01:49:52.819
SM: [hindhi/marathi].

01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:56.451
SM - [hindhi/marathi].

01:49:56.652 --> 01:49:58.736
SM: Yes. So, now we'll sing that

01:49:58.937 --> 01:50:00.698
Jerusalem. SY: Yes.

01:50:00.899 --> 01:50:04.401
SM: And then the aarti.

01:50:04.627 --> 01:50:08.052
One aarti he'll sing of Dhatatreya and then the aarti, our own.

01:50:21.402 --> 01:50:22.402
Sit down. Sit down.

01:50:22.611 --> 01:50:24.180
Stand up. All of you have to stand up.

01:50:24.381 --> 01:50:26.679
Come along, all of you stand up here. Looks very nice.

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.690
The little children should be here.

01:50:29.891 --> 01:50:31.503
SY: All the, all the children.

01:50:31.704 --> 01:50:33.010
SM: All the children.

01:50:33.211 --> 01:50:35.314
SY: We stand up anywhere?
SM: This side.

01:50:35.515 --> 01:50:37.044
SY - Over here.
SM - Or there.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.140
There will be better. SY: Not near the microphone.

01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:47.700
May God bless you all.

01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.440
SM: May God bless you all!

01:59:32.391 --> 01:59:36.924
Now, tomorrow I would like to see the new people

01:59:37.125 --> 01:59:41.836
and doing the meditation here. New people,

01:59:42.037 --> 01:59:44.132
who have not been

01:59:44.333 --> 01:59:46.840
before to our any other programs.

01:59:47.041 --> 01:59:50.109
SY: Did you all hear that? Mother would like to see all the new people

01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:53.828
that have never been to any of the regular meditation programs before,

01:59:54.029 --> 01:59:56.652
to come here for the morning meditation

01:59:56.853 --> 01:59:59.278
and after the morning meditation She'll see you all.

01:59:59.479 --> 02:00:02.397
SM: New York and Boston and anywhere,

02:00:02.598 --> 02:00:04.491
they are coming for the first time.

02:00:04.692 --> 02:00:06.768
SY: Those who are coming for the first time...
