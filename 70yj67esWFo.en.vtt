00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:16.650
Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.843
Sydney, Australia

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:24.837
April 4, 1981

00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:12.329
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.372
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:23.260
This day has never been celebrated before

00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:26.016
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:30.422
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:37.897
because this is the New Year’s Day

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:40.900
of the Shalivahan calendar.

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:45.393
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:47.918
and they are called as Shalivahan

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.748
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.874
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

00:06:54.088 --> 00:06:57.847
so many times My shawls around.

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:00.353
And they were called as Shalivahan.

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:09.269
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.474
the nine days there are.

00:07:12.907 --> 00:07:20.964
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:26.280
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:30.942
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:35.296
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:42.225
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:46.746
when She incarnated on this Earth.

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:50.998
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:56.019
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:10.673
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

00:08:10.874 --> 00:08:14.069
just starting this week.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:16.873
What is the day? The day today is …?

00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:18.328
[Today’s the fourth.]

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:19.529
Today ….

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.171
[Saturday, Mother.]

00:08:22.942 --> 00:08:24.890
[Saturday.]

00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:29.119
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.525
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

00:08:31.726 --> 00:08:34.437
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:37.405
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:38.740
and when you take My photograph

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:41.604
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:43.970
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:47.646
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

00:08:47.847 --> 00:08:49.959
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.395
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:55.606
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

00:08:55.807 --> 00:08:58.963
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

00:08:59.358 --> 00:09:02.264
[Hindi]

00:09:10.845 --> 00:09:16.729
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:23.404
and then the Goddess started working.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:29.542
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:32.387
She started working out on Wednesday.

00:09:32.588 --> 00:09:35.466
Wednesday is the action day,

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:38.257
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:42.634
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:47.202
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

00:09:49.627 --> 00:09:54.014
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:58.738
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

00:09:59.047 --> 00:10:03.343
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:03.544 --> 00:10:06.136
Wednesday is the second day.

00:10:06.337 --> 00:10:11.069
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.721
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:20.539
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:27.805
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

00:10:28.508 --> 00:10:38.817
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:42.307
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:46.023
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:51.425
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

00:10:51.626 --> 00:10:54.964
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:58.253
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

00:10:58.454 --> 00:11:00.696
Venus.

00:11:02.158 --> 00:11:06.261
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:11.727
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:19.863
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:28.356
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

00:11:30.158 --> 00:11:35.013
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

00:11:35.214 --> 00:11:38.815
is of realization, of integration.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:44.183
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

00:11:47.162 --> 00:11:49.618
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:52.025
you cannot understand Christianity.

00:11:52.226 --> 00:11:56.038
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:59.078
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:03.474
then only you will understand what Christ said.

00:12:03.909 --> 00:12:08.755
So today is the day of – first day –

00:12:08.956 --> 00:12:11.414
of when Ganesha was created,

00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:18.750
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

00:12:18.951 --> 00:12:24.553
but according to dates of the moon,

00:12:24.754 --> 00:12:32.375
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

00:12:32.937 --> 00:12:34.111
[Marathi]

00:12:34.312 --> 00:12:38.186
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

00:12:38.387 --> 00:12:40.120
And this is the time when –

00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:43.801
[Marathi]

00:12:49.214 --> 00:12:50.806
Gauri is the Chaitra.

00:12:51.007 --> 00:12:53.224
So the establishment of the Gauri

00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:56.112
is taken place during these nine days.

00:12:56.313 --> 00:13:00.247
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

00:13:00.448 --> 00:13:02.776
Though first Gauri had to come,

00:13:02.977 --> 00:13:08.375
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:12.617
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:19.166
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:21.153
nothing starts;

00:13:21.354 --> 00:13:24.519
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.489
all the negativities,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.199
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.142
all the attentions that are here and there.

00:13:35.343 --> 00:13:37.878
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:40.834
just to ask Him to protect us.

00:13:41.035 --> 00:13:42.797
But first the Gauri has to come,

00:13:42.998 --> 00:13:47.844
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:54.977
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

00:13:55.178 --> 00:14:03.047
negativity, for people to transcend

00:14:03.248 --> 00:14:07.845
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:11.615
the maya, the illusion.

00:14:11.816 --> 00:14:16.064
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:18.949
people used to obstruct

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:24.297
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:30.839
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.725
and the saints were separate;

00:14:33.926 --> 00:14:36.723
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:40.204
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

00:14:40.405 --> 00:14:43.587
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

00:14:43.788 --> 00:14:46.626
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

00:14:46.827 --> 00:14:49.220
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:52.636
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

00:14:52.837 --> 00:14:55.482
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

00:14:55.683 --> 00:14:58.304
so we are not absolute saints.

00:14:58.505 --> 00:15:01.759
And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.023
even when you are worshipping Me,

00:15:04.224 --> 00:15:08.394
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:11.840
Try to be more on the saintly side.

00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:14.320
Because you are saints, no doubt,

00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:18.264
but these horrible things have somehow or other

00:15:18.465 --> 00:15:20.873
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

00:15:21.074 --> 00:15:24.783
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

00:15:24.984 --> 00:15:28.814
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:34.267
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:36.627
kalanka.

00:15:36.828 --> 00:15:40.047
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

00:15:40.248 --> 00:15:44.158
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:46.933
be one with the puja.

00:15:47.134 --> 00:15:54.262
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

00:15:54.463 --> 00:16:00.776
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

00:16:01.924 --> 00:16:04.926
It was to be in Australia.

00:16:05.127 --> 00:16:08.920
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

00:16:09.121 --> 00:16:11.761
celebrated here.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.745
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

00:16:22.946 --> 00:16:25.263
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

00:16:25.464 --> 00:16:27.120
over nine days we have done.

00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.313
But never this Navaratri as such

00:16:29.514 --> 00:16:33.463
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

00:16:33.664 --> 00:16:37.473
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

00:16:37.674 --> 00:16:41.459
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:47.017
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

00:16:47.218 --> 00:16:53.663
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

00:16:53.864 --> 00:17:00.826
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:12.604
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

00:17:12.805 --> 00:17:19.953
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

00:17:20.158 --> 00:17:23.804
our heights,

00:17:24.005 --> 00:17:25.781
in our realization.

00:17:25.982 --> 00:17:28.948
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:31.218
we are rising high;

00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:34.803
so He preserves and He protects.

00:17:35.004 --> 00:17:41.817
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

00:17:42.018 --> 00:17:47.764
to have our ascent in such a way

00:17:47.965 --> 00:17:52.273
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

00:17:52.474 --> 00:17:55.289
we have full dignity;

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:01.186
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

00:18:01.387 --> 00:18:04.734
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:08.160
and do it with our heart genuinely.

00:18:08.361 --> 00:18:12.103
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.624
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

00:18:16.825 --> 00:18:19.132
that is, the Kundalini.

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:22.668
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

00:18:22.888 --> 00:18:26.807
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

00:18:27.033 --> 00:18:32.761
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

00:18:32.962 --> 00:18:36.496
because this is the color of Australia.

00:18:36.697 --> 00:18:40.792
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

00:18:40.993 --> 00:18:44.786
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

00:18:44.987 --> 00:18:48.500
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:54.052
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

00:18:54.253 --> 00:18:57.633
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

00:18:57.834 --> 00:18:59.820
So this one also is just the other way round,

00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:03.880
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:07.975
This is a very traditional combination

00:19:08.176 --> 00:19:13.426
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

00:19:15.353 --> 00:19:21.669
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.107
can become absolutely black,

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:28.220
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

00:19:28.421 --> 00:19:37.870
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:41.435
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:46.659
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:52.620
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:54.963
and that’s why the color is green

00:19:55.164 --> 00:19:58.203
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

00:19:58.404 --> 00:20:01.658
at least She’s covered with.

00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:05.729
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.603
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:11.889
element is the Mother Earth.

00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:19.015
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

00:20:19.829 --> 00:20:23.784
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

00:20:23.985 --> 00:20:26.728
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

00:20:26.929 --> 00:20:32.014
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

00:20:33.223 --> 00:20:34.223
It is said this ….

00:20:34.424 --> 00:20:37.852
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

00:20:38.053 --> 00:20:40.532
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:41.592
What’s she say?

00:20:41.793 --> 00:20:42.686
[They cannot hear.]

00:20:42.887 --> 00:20:44.112
You can’t hear Me?e …]

00:20:44.313 --> 00:20:45.313
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

00:20:45.528 --> 00:20:49.262
All right, so I’ll have to shout.

00:20:50.077 --> 00:20:51.139
Not at all?

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.690
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

00:20:52.891 --> 00:20:55.608
All right. Should I use this?

00:20:57.274 --> 00:21:00.180
All right. This you can hear.

00:21:02.984 --> 00:21:08.409
So I’m now going to tell you

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.555
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:16.122
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

00:21:16.323 --> 00:21:20.467
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

00:21:20.668 --> 00:21:22.915
they don’t know what they are talking.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:26.708
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:29.338
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:34.749
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

00:21:36.168 --> 00:21:40.275
So He’s the first one created.

00:21:40.928 --> 00:21:43.656
Now it’s very symbolic:

00:21:43.857 --> 00:21:46.929
the pure power

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:54.630
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

00:21:54.831 --> 00:21:59.436
The primordial Gauri is that power

00:21:59.637 --> 00:22:03.611
which has separated from Her Lord,

00:22:03.808 --> 00:22:06.636
we can say.

00:22:07.555 --> 00:22:11.109
In Her previous lives She was separated,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.972
and again She’s born as Parvati.

00:22:15.173 --> 00:22:20.641
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

00:22:22.239 --> 00:22:24.974
So now the marriage has taken place,

00:22:25.175 --> 00:22:28.908
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

00:22:29.109 --> 00:22:32.554
The wedding kindling has to start.

00:22:33.288 --> 00:22:34.934
But She’s not yet married,

00:22:35.135 --> 00:22:37.020
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

00:22:37.221 --> 00:22:45.465
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:49.892
Before that She wants to have a bath,

00:22:50.093 --> 00:22:53.033
because She has to meet Her Lord.

00:22:53.234 --> 00:22:56.782
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

00:22:56.983 --> 00:23:02.147
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

00:23:03.203 --> 00:23:06.103
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

00:23:06.304 --> 00:23:09.225
when She’s having Her bath.

00:23:10.135 --> 00:23:12.394
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

00:23:12.595 --> 00:23:17.304
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

00:23:17.505 --> 00:23:19.782
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:23.600
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

00:23:24.389 --> 00:23:27.695
So She closes the door,

00:23:27.896 --> 00:23:32.747
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

00:23:33.249 --> 00:23:43.996
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

00:23:44.197 --> 00:23:47.479
for the bride specially it is the right one,

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.433
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

00:23:50.634 --> 00:23:53.843
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

00:23:54.044 --> 00:23:58.301
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

00:24:01.843 --> 00:24:04.837
She puts that – is made of camphor

00:24:05.038 --> 00:24:09.009
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:13.749
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:19.489
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

00:24:20.054 --> 00:24:22.721
She’s having Her bath nicely.

00:24:22.922 --> 00:24:28.019
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.571
She doesn’t hear Him.

00:24:30.772 --> 00:24:36.654
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

00:24:37.593 --> 00:24:39.937
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

00:24:40.128 --> 00:24:44.727
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:47.688
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

00:24:47.889 --> 00:24:50.752
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

00:24:50.953 --> 00:24:54.822
See now the Immaculate Conception,

00:24:55.023 --> 00:24:57.341
try to understand.

00:24:57.542 --> 00:25:05.488
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

00:25:05.689 --> 00:25:10.491
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

00:25:10.692 --> 00:25:15.203
So He cuts His neck in anger,

00:25:15.404 --> 00:25:18.006
and He enters into the bathroom.

00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:22.087
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

00:25:22.294 --> 00:25:26.233
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

00:25:26.434 --> 00:25:31.238
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:36.167
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:39.405
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

00:25:39.606 --> 00:25:43.284
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

00:25:43.485 --> 00:25:46.313
How dare You kill Him?”

00:25:46.608 --> 00:25:48.702
She said, “ Now what to do?”

00:25:48.903 --> 00:25:51.514
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

00:25:51.715 --> 00:25:59.279
and find the head of any animal that is available,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.631
and we will put that on this trunk

00:26:03.848 --> 00:26:07.447
and He’ll be My son again.”

00:26:07.648 --> 00:26:11.807
Now it’s all prearranged;

00:26:12.015 --> 00:26:15.926
because this child was not to grow into

00:26:16.127 --> 00:26:19.009
a human ego and superego business.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:23.381
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:28.917
embodiment of childlike innocence,

00:26:29.118 --> 00:26:32.166
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

00:26:32.367 --> 00:26:35.928
So they had to get the head of an animal.

00:26:36.129 --> 00:26:45.054
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

00:26:45.255 --> 00:26:48.826
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

00:26:49.027 --> 00:26:52.753
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

00:26:53.137 --> 00:26:56.871
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

00:26:57.072 --> 00:27:00.955
was lying down with her back towards her child,

00:27:01.156 --> 00:27:04.703
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

00:27:04.904 --> 00:27:07.047
towards their children, never.

00:27:07.248 --> 00:27:10.884
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

00:27:11.085 --> 00:27:14.377
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

00:27:14.578 --> 00:27:18.098
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

00:27:18.299 --> 00:27:20.867
but she would never put the child at the back.

00:27:21.068 --> 00:27:24.763
So the head of that little animal was cut,

00:27:24.964 --> 00:27:28.982
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

00:27:29.183 --> 00:27:32.979
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:42.561
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

00:27:43.827 --> 00:27:48.513
So the body is from Mahakali,

00:27:48.714 --> 00:27:54.214
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:06.277
Now this Ganesha within us resides

00:28:06.478 --> 00:28:09.478
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:28:10.087 --> 00:28:14.783
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

00:28:14.984 --> 00:28:21.304
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

00:28:21.505 --> 00:28:24.115
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

00:28:24.316 --> 00:28:27.782
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

00:28:27.968 --> 00:28:30.561
and that’s how they started all these perversions

00:28:30.762 --> 00:28:33.208
and wrong things about Ganesha.

00:28:33.424 --> 00:28:36.991
But He is embodiment of innocence,

00:28:37.192 --> 00:28:41.599
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

00:28:41.808 --> 00:28:47.807
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

00:28:48.012 --> 00:28:51.919
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.894
on this Earth as Kalki.

00:28:55.095 --> 00:28:57.737
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

00:28:57.938 --> 00:28:59.902
such a dynamic personality like Him,

00:29:00.103 --> 00:29:03.553
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

00:29:03.768 --> 00:29:05.473
And it is impossible,

00:29:05.674 --> 00:29:07.702
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

00:29:07.903 --> 00:29:12.888
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

00:29:13.101 --> 00:29:18.892
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

00:29:19.088 --> 00:29:23.247
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:27.388
who has no power to kill anyone.

00:29:27.848 --> 00:29:31.087
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:34.854
I don’t know how they manage these things.

00:29:36.996 --> 00:29:39.466
They catch hold of one thing,

00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:41.940
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

00:29:42.141 --> 00:29:45.636
now how are they authorized, God knows?

00:29:45.837 --> 00:29:49.237
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

00:29:49.438 --> 00:29:52.616
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

00:29:52.817 --> 00:29:54.861
He said it in such a good way,

00:29:55.062 --> 00:29:58.833
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

00:29:59.034 --> 00:30:02.373
that “Those who are,

00:30:02.574 --> 00:30:05.364
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

00:30:05.565 --> 00:30:08.314
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:12.198
very clearly. Why did He say so?

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:16.412
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

00:30:16.613 --> 00:30:19.188
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:22.200
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

00:30:22.401 --> 00:30:25.399
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.490
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:30.475
you have a special right.

00:30:30.676 --> 00:30:33.428
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:37.912
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

00:30:38.113 --> 00:30:42.300
because you have spoilt your innocence.

00:30:42.718 --> 00:30:46.264
They have not spoilt their innocence.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.407
So though you may call yourself Christians,

00:30:48.608 --> 00:30:52.513
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

00:30:52.728 --> 00:30:55.259
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.009
which we have ruined.

00:30:58.848 --> 00:31:01.967
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

00:31:02.168 --> 00:31:05.261
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

00:31:05.462 --> 00:31:07.807
a conditioning;

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:14.264
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:17.108
You must re-establish your innocence.

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:22.631
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

00:31:22.832 --> 00:31:26.247
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

00:31:26.448 --> 00:31:30.644
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

00:31:30.845 --> 00:31:34.533
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:37.483
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

00:31:37.684 --> 00:31:40.391
we could not fall into anything.

00:31:40.592 --> 00:31:43.962
India is like, large like an elephant.

00:31:44.163 --> 00:31:46.970
Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:49.058
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

00:31:49.259 --> 00:31:51.787
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

00:31:51.988 --> 00:31:54.799
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.953
we never accepted him.

00:31:57.154 --> 00:32:00.332
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

00:32:00.533 --> 00:32:04.772
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

00:32:04.968 --> 00:32:07.132
so nothing got into their heads.

00:32:07.333 --> 00:32:09.167
They never spoiled their innocence,

00:32:09.368 --> 00:32:12.727
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

00:32:12.928 --> 00:32:15.688
to new ideas.

00:32:16.647 --> 00:32:19.872
And that’s how they have, despite everything

00:32:20.088 --> 00:32:21.947
they are not converted Christians,

00:32:22.148 --> 00:32:23.972
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

00:32:24.173 --> 00:32:27.328
They have maintained their innocence much more

00:32:27.542 --> 00:32:30.020
and their sincerity of their heart,

00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:32.710
because they are not disconnected.

00:32:32.928 --> 00:32:35.047
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

00:32:35.231 --> 00:32:39.196
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

00:32:39.397 --> 00:32:42.127
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:45.328
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:48.073
they know in their – that it is wrong.

00:32:48.274 --> 00:32:50.071
They may try, I mean, like people steal

00:32:50.272 --> 00:32:54.274
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

00:32:54.475 --> 00:32:59.817
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

00:33:00.018 --> 00:33:06.541
our position as innocent people.

00:33:06.795 --> 00:33:10.091
But your Mother is very gracious,

00:33:10.292 --> 00:33:13.896
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

00:33:14.097 --> 00:33:20.940
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

00:33:21.163 --> 00:33:24.387
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:27.135
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

00:33:27.336 --> 00:33:31.086
that you can come so close to Me.

00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:36.951
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

00:33:40.066 --> 00:33:45.316
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

00:33:45.517 --> 00:33:48.571
but Shri Ganesha.

00:33:49.443 --> 00:33:55.302
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

00:33:55.648 --> 00:34:00.057
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

00:34:00.258 --> 00:34:02.688
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

00:34:02.905 --> 00:34:06.109
you have no idea at all.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:12.349
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

00:34:13.201 --> 00:34:16.308
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

00:34:16.509 --> 00:34:18.961
that is being also established.

00:34:19.162 --> 00:34:21.652
You’ll get back your innocence.

00:34:21.853 --> 00:34:25.749
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.315
one has to learn, that

00:34:27.516 --> 00:34:31.799
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.953
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

00:34:36.662 --> 00:34:38.743
He’s so dedicated.

00:34:38.944 --> 00:34:43.309
There’s a story once when Parvati,

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.189
His Mother gave –

00:34:48.759 --> 00:34:52.483
said that “I will give You a big present,

00:34:52.684 --> 00:34:55.530
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:59.695
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:03.997
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

00:35:04.198 --> 00:35:07.097
Is the, all the destructive powers

00:35:07.298 --> 00:35:10.046
were combined to create Kartikeya.

00:35:10.247 --> 00:35:15.744
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:18.788
I’ll give You a prize.”

00:35:19.588 --> 00:35:24.902
So, the conveyance of

00:35:25.103 --> 00:35:28.510
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

00:35:28.711 --> 00:35:33.093
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

00:35:33.387 --> 00:35:38.573
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

00:35:38.774 --> 00:35:41.992
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

00:35:42.193 --> 00:35:46.138
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

00:35:46.843 --> 00:35:49.127
She has created all the gods.

00:35:49.328 --> 00:35:52.420
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:55.273
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

00:35:55.474 --> 00:35:58.457
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

00:35:58.658 --> 00:36:02.815
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

00:36:03.016 --> 00:36:05.869
only thrice and He got the prize.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:10.327
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

00:36:10.624 --> 00:36:13.952
He fought even Shiva.

00:36:14.254 --> 00:36:17.097
He fought everyone.

00:36:17.334 --> 00:36:20.567
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

00:36:20.768 --> 00:36:24.557
that shows complete dedication.

00:36:24.758 --> 00:36:26.882
And for Sahaja yogis

00:36:27.083 --> 00:36:32.529
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:39.003
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

00:36:41.175 --> 00:36:44.881
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

00:36:45.082 --> 00:36:48.449
that’s important, though I am so close.

00:36:48.853 --> 00:36:54.370
Even Christ would not say anything;

00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:59.719
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

00:37:00.255 --> 00:37:02.338
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:07.214
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

00:37:07.415 --> 00:37:10.454
But you forget.

00:37:10.697 --> 00:37:16.341
So it is important to understand that they were great

00:37:16.542 --> 00:37:21.439
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.000
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:27.638
which Raul Bai will teach you,

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:31.651
so that you do not make any mistakes

00:37:31.852 --> 00:37:34.646
of saying things which are not proper.

00:37:34.847 --> 00:37:36.972
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

00:37:37.173 --> 00:37:40.113
but consciously if you work it out

00:37:40.314 --> 00:37:43.509
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.523
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

00:37:46.724 --> 00:37:50.622
anything, can you believe it?

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:55.145
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

00:37:55.346 --> 00:37:59.338
anything against the Holy Spirit.

00:38:01.288 --> 00:38:03.709
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:08.688
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

00:38:08.908 --> 00:38:12.146
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

00:38:12.347 --> 00:38:15.515
and how far to go, how far to understand

00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:21.442
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.417
So today we have a great day

00:38:24.618 --> 00:38:32.188
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

00:38:32.389 --> 00:38:36.414
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:39.884
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

00:38:40.085 --> 00:38:42.085
About the times and timings,

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:45.121
one should know that Mother knows best,

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:48.909
and everything works out with the timing properly.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:54.563
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

00:38:55.524 --> 00:38:59.436
and all the timings work out in that way.

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:03.219
So everything has to work in the way,

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.844
actually the timings are of the moon,

00:39:06.045 --> 00:39:08.620
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

00:39:08.821 --> 00:39:10.702
what time this works out, this thing, that.

00:39:10.903 --> 00:39:13.312
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:13.513 --> 00:39:17.959
work out according to My understanding.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.848
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

00:39:23.049 --> 00:39:26.174
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:28.543
Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

00:39:28.744 --> 00:39:31.539
And if your ego is there or anything,

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.302
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

00:39:37.238 --> 00:39:38.646
All right?

00:39:38.847 --> 00:39:42.717
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

00:39:42.918 --> 00:39:44.586
as Modi will be doing,

00:39:44.787 --> 00:39:48.947
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

00:39:49.148 --> 00:39:53.163
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.864
[Hindi]

00:40:02.644 --> 00:40:06.118
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:10.315
Let all the children come for the puja.
