00:12.651 --> 00:16.650
Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

00:16.851 --> 00:20.843
Sydney, Australia

00:21.044 --> 00:24.837
April 4, 1981

06:08.097 --> 06:12.329
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

06:12.530 --> 06:19.372
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

06:20.549 --> 06:23.260
This day has never been celebrated before

06:23.461 --> 06:26.016
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

06:26.217 --> 06:30.422
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

06:30.623 --> 06:37.897
because this is the New Year’s Day

06:38.098 --> 06:40.900
of the Shalivahan calendar.

06:41.101 --> 06:45.393
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

06:45.594 --> 06:47.918
and they are called as Shalivahan

06:48.119 --> 06:50.748
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

06:50.949 --> 06:53.874
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

06:54.088 --> 06:57.847
so many times My shawls around.

06:58.349 --> 07:00.353
And they were called as Shalivahan.

07:00.554 --> 07:09.269
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

07:09.470 --> 07:12.474
the nine days there are.

07:12.907 --> 07:20.964
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

07:21.165 --> 07:26.280
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

07:26.481 --> 07:30.942
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

07:31.128 --> 07:35.296
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

07:36.036 --> 07:42.225
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

07:42.426 --> 07:46.746
when She incarnated on this Earth.

07:47.405 --> 07:50.998
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

07:51.199 --> 07:56.019
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

07:57.151 --> 08:10.673
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

08:10.874 --> 08:14.069
just starting this week.

08:14.639 --> 08:16.873
What is the day? The day today is …?

08:17.074 --> 08:18.328
[Today’s the fourth.]

08:18.529 --> 08:19.529
Today ….

08:19.730 --> 08:22.171
[Saturday, Mother.]

08:22.942 --> 08:24.890
[Saturday.]

08:25.091 --> 08:29.119
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

08:29.320 --> 08:31.525
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

08:31.726 --> 08:34.437
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

08:34.638 --> 08:37.405
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

08:37.606 --> 08:38.740
and when you take My photograph

08:38.941 --> 08:41.604
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

08:41.805 --> 08:43.970
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

08:44.171 --> 08:47.646
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

08:47.847 --> 08:49.959
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.395
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

08:52.596 --> 08:55.606
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

08:55.807 --> 08:58.963
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

08:59.358 --> 09:02.264
[Hindi]

09:10.845 --> 09:16.729
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

09:16.930 --> 09:23.404
and then the Goddess started working.

09:23.605 --> 09:29.542
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

09:29.743 --> 09:32.387
She started working out on Wednesday.

09:32.588 --> 09:35.466
Wednesday is the action day,

09:35.667 --> 09:38.257
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

09:38.458 --> 09:42.634
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

09:42.835 --> 09:47.202
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

09:49.627 --> 09:54.014
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

09:54.215 --> 09:58.738
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

09:59.047 --> 10:03.343
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

10:03.544 --> 10:06.136
Wednesday is the second day.

10:06.337 --> 10:11.069
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

10:11.270 --> 10:15.721
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

10:15.922 --> 10:20.539
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

10:20.740 --> 10:27.805
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

10:28.508 --> 10:38.817
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

10:39.018 --> 10:42.307
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

10:42.508 --> 10:46.023
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

10:48.336 --> 10:51.425
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

10:51.626 --> 10:54.964
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

10:55.165 --> 10:58.253
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

10:58.454 --> 11:00.696
Venus.

11:02.158 --> 11:06.261
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

11:06.462 --> 11:11.727
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

11:13.278 --> 11:19.863
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

11:23.825 --> 11:28.356
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

11:30.158 --> 11:35.013
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

11:35.214 --> 11:38.815
is of realization, of integration.

11:39.449 --> 11:44.183
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

11:47.162 --> 11:49.618
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

11:49.819 --> 11:52.025
you cannot understand Christianity.

11:52.226 --> 11:56.038
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

11:56.239 --> 11:59.078
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

11:59.279 --> 12:03.474
then only you will understand what Christ said.

12:03.909 --> 12:08.755
So today is the day of – first day –

12:08.956 --> 12:11.414
of when Ganesha was created,

12:11.615 --> 12:18.750
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

12:18.951 --> 12:24.553
but according to dates of the moon,

12:24.754 --> 12:32.375
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

12:32.937 --> 12:34.111
[Marathi]

12:34.312 --> 12:38.186
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

12:38.387 --> 12:40.120
And this is the time when –

12:40.321 --> 12:43.801
[Marathi]

12:49.214 --> 12:50.806
Gauri is the Chaitra.

12:51.007 --> 12:53.224
So the establishment of the Gauri

12:53.425 --> 12:56.112
is taken place during these nine days.

12:56.313 --> 13:00.247
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

13:00.448 --> 13:02.776
Though first Gauri had to come,

13:02.977 --> 13:08.375
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

13:08.576 --> 13:12.617
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

13:12.818 --> 13:19.166
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

13:19.367 --> 13:21.153
nothing starts;

13:21.354 --> 13:24.519
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

13:24.720 --> 13:27.489
all the negativities,

13:27.690 --> 13:30.199
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

13:30.400 --> 13:35.142
all the attentions that are here and there.

13:35.343 --> 13:37.878
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

13:38.079 --> 13:40.834
just to ask Him to protect us.

13:41.035 --> 13:42.797
But first the Gauri has to come,

13:42.998 --> 13:47.844
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

13:48.045 --> 13:54.977
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

13:55.178 --> 14:03.047
negativity, for people to transcend

14:03.248 --> 14:07.845
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

14:08.046 --> 14:11.615
the maya, the illusion.

14:11.816 --> 14:16.064
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

14:16.265 --> 14:18.949
people used to obstruct

14:19.150 --> 14:24.297
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

14:24.498 --> 14:30.839
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

14:31.040 --> 14:33.725
and the saints were separate;

14:33.926 --> 14:36.723
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

14:36.924 --> 14:40.204
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

14:40.405 --> 14:43.587
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

14:43.788 --> 14:46.626
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

14:46.827 --> 14:49.220
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.636
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

14:52.837 --> 14:55.482
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

14:55.683 --> 14:58.304
so we are not absolute saints.

14:58.505 --> 15:01.759
And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

15:01.960 --> 15:04.023
even when you are worshipping Me,

15:04.224 --> 15:08.394
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

15:08.595 --> 15:11.840
Try to be more on the saintly side.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.320
Because you are saints, no doubt,

15:14.521 --> 15:18.264
but these horrible things have somehow or other

15:18.465 --> 15:20.873
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

15:21.074 --> 15:24.783
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

15:24.984 --> 15:28.814
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

15:29.015 --> 15:34.267
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

15:34.468 --> 15:36.627
kalanka.

15:36.828 --> 15:40.047
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

15:40.248 --> 15:44.158
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

15:44.359 --> 15:46.933
be one with the puja.

15:47.134 --> 15:54.262
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

15:54.463 --> 16:00.776
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

16:01.924 --> 16:04.926
It was to be in Australia.

16:05.127 --> 16:08.920
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

16:09.121 --> 16:11.761
celebrated here.

16:18.550 --> 16:22.745
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

16:22.946 --> 16:25.263
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

16:25.464 --> 16:27.120
over nine days we have done.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.313
But never this Navaratri as such

16:29.514 --> 16:33.463
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

16:33.664 --> 16:37.473
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

16:37.674 --> 16:41.459
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

16:41.660 --> 16:47.017
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

16:47.218 --> 16:53.663
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

16:53.864 --> 17:00.826
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

17:08.054 --> 17:12.604
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

17:12.805 --> 17:19.953
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

17:20.158 --> 17:23.804
our heights,

17:24.005 --> 17:25.781
in our realization.

17:25.982 --> 17:28.948
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

17:29.149 --> 17:31.218
we are rising high;

17:31.419 --> 17:34.803
so He preserves and He protects.

17:35.004 --> 17:41.817
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

17:42.018 --> 17:47.764
to have our ascent in such a way

17:47.965 --> 17:52.273
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

17:52.474 --> 17:55.289
we have full dignity;

17:55.490 --> 18:01.186
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

18:01.387 --> 18:04.734
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

18:04.935 --> 18:08.160
and do it with our heart genuinely.

18:08.361 --> 18:12.103
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

18:13.150 --> 18:16.624
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

18:16.825 --> 18:19.132
that is, the Kundalini.

18:19.333 --> 18:22.668
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

18:22.888 --> 18:26.807
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

18:27.033 --> 18:32.761
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

18:32.962 --> 18:36.496
because this is the color of Australia.

18:36.697 --> 18:40.792
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

18:40.993 --> 18:44.786
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

18:44.987 --> 18:48.500
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

18:48.701 --> 18:54.052
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

18:54.253 --> 18:57.633
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.820
So this one also is just the other way round,

19:00.021 --> 19:03.880
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

19:04.081 --> 19:07.975
This is a very traditional combination

19:08.176 --> 19:13.426
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

19:15.353 --> 19:21.669
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

19:21.870 --> 19:24.107
can become absolutely black,

19:24.308 --> 19:28.220
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

19:28.421 --> 19:37.870
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

19:38.071 --> 19:41.435
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

19:41.636 --> 19:46.659
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

19:47.721 --> 19:52.620
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

19:52.821 --> 19:54.963
and that’s why the color is green

19:55.164 --> 19:58.203
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

19:58.404 --> 20:01.658
at least She’s covered with.

20:01.939 --> 20:05.729
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

20:05.930 --> 20:08.603
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

20:08.804 --> 20:11.889
element is the Mother Earth.

20:13.086 --> 20:19.015
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

20:19.829 --> 20:23.784
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

20:23.985 --> 20:26.728
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

20:26.929 --> 20:32.014
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

20:33.223 --> 20:34.223
It is said this ….

20:34.424 --> 20:37.852
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

20:38.053 --> 20:40.532
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

20:40.733 --> 20:41.592
What’s she say?

20:41.793 --> 20:42.686
[They cannot hear.]

20:42.887 --> 20:44.112
You can’t hear Me?e …]

20:44.313 --> 20:45.313
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

20:45.528 --> 20:49.262
All right, so I’ll have to shout.

20:50.077 --> 20:51.139
Not at all?

20:51.340 --> 20:52.690
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

20:52.891 --> 20:55.608
All right. Should I use this?

20:57.274 --> 21:00.180
All right. This you can hear.

21:02.984 --> 21:08.409
So I’m now going to tell you

21:08.610 --> 21:11.555
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

21:11.756 --> 21:16.122
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

21:16.323 --> 21:20.467
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

21:20.668 --> 21:22.915
they don’t know what they are talking.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.708
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

21:26.909 --> 21:29.338
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

21:29.539 --> 21:34.749
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

21:36.168 --> 21:40.275
So He’s the first one created.

21:40.928 --> 21:43.656
Now it’s very symbolic:

21:43.857 --> 21:46.929
the pure power

21:47.130 --> 21:54.630
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

21:54.831 --> 21:59.436
The primordial Gauri is that power

21:59.637 --> 22:03.611
which has separated from Her Lord,

22:03.808 --> 22:06.636
we can say.

22:07.555 --> 22:11.109
In Her previous lives She was separated,

22:11.310 --> 22:14.972
and again She’s born as Parvati.

22:15.173 --> 22:20.641
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

22:22.239 --> 22:24.974
So now the marriage has taken place,

22:25.175 --> 22:28.908
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

22:29.109 --> 22:32.554
The wedding kindling has to start.

22:33.288 --> 22:34.934
But She’s not yet married,

22:35.135 --> 22:37.020
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

22:37.221 --> 22:45.465
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

22:45.941 --> 22:49.892
Before that She wants to have a bath,

22:50.093 --> 22:53.033
because She has to meet Her Lord.

22:53.234 --> 22:56.782
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

22:56.983 --> 23:02.147
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

23:03.203 --> 23:06.103
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

23:06.304 --> 23:09.225
when She’s having Her bath.

23:10.135 --> 23:12.394
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

23:12.595 --> 23:17.304
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

23:17.505 --> 23:19.782
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

23:19.983 --> 23:23.600
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

23:24.389 --> 23:27.695
So She closes the door,

23:27.896 --> 23:32.747
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

23:33.249 --> 23:43.996
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

23:44.197 --> 23:47.479
for the bride specially it is the right one,

23:47.680 --> 23:50.433
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

23:50.634 --> 23:53.843
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

23:54.044 --> 23:58.301
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

24:01.843 --> 24:04.837
She puts that – is made of camphor

24:05.038 --> 24:09.009
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

24:09.210 --> 24:13.749
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

24:13.950 --> 24:19.489
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

24:20.054 --> 24:22.721
She’s having Her bath nicely.

24:22.922 --> 24:28.019
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

24:28.220 --> 24:30.571
She doesn’t hear Him.

24:30.772 --> 24:36.654
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

24:37.593 --> 24:39.937
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

24:40.128 --> 24:44.727
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

24:44.941 --> 24:47.688
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

24:47.889 --> 24:50.752
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

24:50.953 --> 24:54.822
See now the Immaculate Conception,

24:55.023 --> 24:57.341
try to understand.

24:57.542 --> 25:05.488
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

25:05.689 --> 25:10.491
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

25:10.692 --> 25:15.203
So He cuts His neck in anger,

25:15.404 --> 25:18.006
and He enters into the bathroom.

25:18.208 --> 25:22.087
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

25:22.294 --> 25:26.233
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

25:26.434 --> 25:31.238
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

25:31.439 --> 25:36.167
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

25:36.368 --> 25:39.405
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

25:39.606 --> 25:43.284
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

25:43.485 --> 25:46.313
How dare You kill Him?”

25:46.608 --> 25:48.702
She said, “ Now what to do?”

25:48.903 --> 25:51.514
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

25:51.715 --> 25:59.279
and find the head of any animal that is available,

25:59.480 --> 26:03.631
and we will put that on this trunk

26:03.848 --> 26:07.447
and He’ll be My son again.”

26:07.648 --> 26:11.807
Now it’s all prearranged;

26:12.015 --> 26:15.926
because this child was not to grow into

26:16.127 --> 26:19.009
a human ego and superego business.

26:19.210 --> 26:23.381
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

26:23.582 --> 26:28.917
embodiment of childlike innocence,

26:29.118 --> 26:32.166
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

26:32.367 --> 26:35.928
So they had to get the head of an animal.

26:36.129 --> 26:45.054
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

26:45.255 --> 26:48.826
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

26:49.027 --> 26:52.753
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

26:53.137 --> 26:56.871
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

26:57.072 --> 27:00.955
was lying down with her back towards her child,

27:01.156 --> 27:04.703
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

27:04.904 --> 27:07.047
towards their children, never.

27:07.248 --> 27:10.884
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

27:11.085 --> 27:14.377
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

27:14.578 --> 27:18.098
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

27:18.299 --> 27:20.867
but she would never put the child at the back.

27:21.068 --> 27:24.763
So the head of that little animal was cut,

27:24.964 --> 27:28.982
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

27:29.183 --> 27:32.979
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

27:33.180 --> 27:42.561
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

27:43.827 --> 27:48.513
So the body is from Mahakali,

27:48.714 --> 27:54.214
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

27:58.380 --> 28:06.277
Now this Ganesha within us resides

28:06.478 --> 28:09.478
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

28:10.087 --> 28:14.783
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

28:14.984 --> 28:21.304
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

28:21.505 --> 28:24.115
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

28:24.316 --> 28:27.782
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

28:27.968 --> 28:30.561
and that’s how they started all these perversions

28:30.762 --> 28:33.208
and wrong things about Ganesha.

28:33.424 --> 28:36.991
But He is embodiment of innocence,

28:37.192 --> 28:41.599
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

28:41.808 --> 28:47.807
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

28:48.012 --> 28:51.919
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

28:52.120 --> 28:54.894
on this Earth as Kalki.

28:55.095 --> 28:57.737
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

28:57.938 --> 28:59.902
such a dynamic personality like Him,

29:00.103 --> 29:03.553
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

29:03.768 --> 29:05.473
And it is impossible,

29:05.674 --> 29:07.702
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

29:07.903 --> 29:12.888
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

29:13.101 --> 29:18.892
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

29:19.088 --> 29:23.247
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

29:23.428 --> 29:27.388
who has no power to kill anyone.

29:27.848 --> 29:31.087
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

29:31.269 --> 29:34.854
I don’t know how they manage these things.

29:36.996 --> 29:39.466
They catch hold of one thing,

29:39.667 --> 29:41.940
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

29:42.141 --> 29:45.636
now how are they authorized, God knows?

29:45.837 --> 29:49.237
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

29:49.438 --> 29:52.616
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

29:52.817 --> 29:54.861
He said it in such a good way,

29:55.062 --> 29:58.833
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

29:59.034 --> 30:02.373
that “Those who are,

30:02.574 --> 30:05.364
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

30:05.565 --> 30:08.314
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

30:08.515 --> 30:12.198
very clearly. Why did He say so?

30:12.399 --> 30:16.412
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

30:16.613 --> 30:19.188
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

30:19.389 --> 30:22.200
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

30:22.401 --> 30:25.399
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.490
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

30:27.691 --> 30:30.475
you have a special right.

30:30.676 --> 30:33.428
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

30:33.629 --> 30:37.912
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

30:38.113 --> 30:42.300
because you have spoilt your innocence.

30:42.718 --> 30:46.264
They have not spoilt their innocence.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.407
So though you may call yourself Christians,

30:48.608 --> 30:52.513
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

30:52.728 --> 30:55.259
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

30:55.460 --> 30:58.009
which we have ruined.

30:58.848 --> 31:01.967
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

31:02.168 --> 31:05.261
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

31:05.462 --> 31:07.807
a conditioning;

31:08.030 --> 31:14.264
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

31:14.549 --> 31:17.108
You must re-establish your innocence.

31:17.309 --> 31:22.631
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

31:22.832 --> 31:26.247
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

31:26.448 --> 31:30.644
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

31:30.845 --> 31:34.533
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

31:34.734 --> 31:37.483
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

31:37.684 --> 31:40.391
we could not fall into anything.

31:40.592 --> 31:43.962
India is like, large like an elephant.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.970
Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

31:47.171 --> 31:49.058
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

31:49.259 --> 31:51.787
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

31:51.988 --> 31:54.799
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.953
we never accepted him.

31:57.154 --> 32:00.332
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

32:00.533 --> 32:04.772
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

32:04.968 --> 32:07.132
so nothing got into their heads.

32:07.333 --> 32:09.167
They never spoiled their innocence,

32:09.368 --> 32:12.727
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

32:12.928 --> 32:15.688
to new ideas.

32:16.647 --> 32:19.872
And that’s how they have, despite everything

32:20.088 --> 32:21.947
they are not converted Christians,

32:22.148 --> 32:23.972
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

32:24.173 --> 32:27.328
They have maintained their innocence much more

32:27.542 --> 32:30.020
and their sincerity of their heart,

32:30.221 --> 32:32.710
because they are not disconnected.

32:32.928 --> 32:35.047
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

32:35.231 --> 32:39.196
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

32:39.397 --> 32:42.127
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

32:42.328 --> 32:45.328
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

32:45.529 --> 32:48.073
they know in their – that it is wrong.

32:48.274 --> 32:50.071
They may try, I mean, like people steal

32:50.272 --> 32:54.274
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

32:54.475 --> 32:59.817
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

33:00.018 --> 33:06.541
our position as innocent people.

33:06.795 --> 33:10.091
But your Mother is very gracious,

33:10.292 --> 33:13.896
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

33:14.097 --> 33:20.940
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

33:21.163 --> 33:24.387
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

33:24.588 --> 33:27.135
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

33:27.336 --> 33:31.086
that you can come so close to Me.

33:31.951 --> 33:36.951
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

33:40.066 --> 33:45.316
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

33:45.517 --> 33:48.571
but Shri Ganesha.

33:49.443 --> 33:55.302
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

33:55.648 --> 34:00.057
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

34:00.258 --> 34:02.688
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

34:02.905 --> 34:06.109
you have no idea at all.

34:06.310 --> 34:12.349
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

34:13.201 --> 34:16.308
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

34:16.509 --> 34:18.961
that is being also established.

34:19.162 --> 34:21.652
You’ll get back your innocence.

34:21.853 --> 34:25.749
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

34:25.950 --> 34:27.315
one has to learn, that

34:27.516 --> 34:31.799
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.953
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

34:36.662 --> 34:38.743
He’s so dedicated.

34:38.944 --> 34:43.309
There’s a story once when Parvati,

34:43.510 --> 34:47.189
His Mother gave –

34:48.759 --> 34:52.483
said that “I will give You a big present,

34:52.684 --> 34:55.530
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

34:55.731 --> 34:59.695
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

34:59.896 --> 35:03.997
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

35:04.198 --> 35:07.097
Is the, all the destructive powers

35:07.298 --> 35:10.046
were combined to create Kartikeya.

35:10.247 --> 35:15.744
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

35:15.945 --> 35:18.788
I’ll give You a prize.”

35:19.588 --> 35:24.902
So, the conveyance of

35:25.103 --> 35:28.510
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

35:28.711 --> 35:33.093
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

35:33.387 --> 35:38.573
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

35:38.774 --> 35:41.992
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

35:42.193 --> 35:46.138
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

35:46.843 --> 35:49.127
She has created all the gods.

35:49.328 --> 35:52.420
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

35:52.621 --> 35:55.273
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

35:55.474 --> 35:58.457
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

35:58.658 --> 36:02.815
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

36:03.016 --> 36:05.869
only thrice and He got the prize.

36:06.070 --> 36:10.327
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

36:10.624 --> 36:13.952
He fought even Shiva.

36:14.254 --> 36:17.097
He fought everyone.

36:17.334 --> 36:20.567
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

36:20.768 --> 36:24.557
that shows complete dedication.

36:24.758 --> 36:26.882
And for Sahaja yogis

36:27.083 --> 36:32.529
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

36:32.730 --> 36:39.003
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

36:41.175 --> 36:44.881
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

36:45.082 --> 36:48.449
that’s important, though I am so close.

36:48.853 --> 36:54.370
Even Christ would not say anything;

36:54.571 --> 36:59.719
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

37:00.255 --> 37:02.338
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

37:02.539 --> 37:07.214
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

37:07.415 --> 37:10.454
But you forget.

37:10.697 --> 37:16.341
So it is important to understand that they were great

37:16.542 --> 37:21.439
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.000
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

37:25.201 --> 37:27.638
which Raul Bai will teach you,

37:27.839 --> 37:31.651
so that you do not make any mistakes

37:31.852 --> 37:34.646
of saying things which are not proper.

37:34.847 --> 37:36.972
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

37:37.173 --> 37:40.113
but consciously if you work it out

37:40.314 --> 37:43.509
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

37:43.710 --> 37:46.523
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

37:46.724 --> 37:50.622
anything, can you believe it?

37:51.119 --> 37:55.145
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

37:55.346 --> 37:59.338
anything against the Holy Spirit.

38:01.288 --> 38:03.709
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

38:03.910 --> 38:08.688
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

38:08.908 --> 38:12.146
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

38:12.347 --> 38:15.515
and how far to go, how far to understand

38:15.728 --> 38:21.442
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

38:21.930 --> 38:24.417
So today we have a great day

38:24.618 --> 38:32.188
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

38:32.389 --> 38:36.414
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

38:36.615 --> 38:39.884
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.085
About the times and timings,

38:42.286 --> 38:45.121
one should know that Mother knows best,

38:45.322 --> 38:48.909
and everything works out with the timing properly.

38:49.110 --> 38:54.563
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

38:55.524 --> 38:59.436
and all the timings work out in that way.

38:59.637 --> 39:03.219
So everything has to work in the way,

39:03.420 --> 39:05.844
actually the timings are of the moon,

39:06.045 --> 39:08.620
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

39:08.821 --> 39:10.702
what time this works out, this thing, that.

39:10.903 --> 39:13.312
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

39:13.513 --> 39:17.959
work out according to My understanding.

39:18.160 --> 39:22.848
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

39:23.049 --> 39:26.174
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.543
Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

39:28.744 --> 39:31.539
And if your ego is there or anything,

39:31.740 --> 39:35.302
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

39:37.238 --> 39:38.646
All right?

39:38.847 --> 39:42.717
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

39:42.918 --> 39:44.586
as Modi will be doing,

39:44.787 --> 39:48.947
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

39:49.148 --> 39:53.163
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.864
[Hindi]

40:02.644 --> 40:06.118
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

40:06.319 --> 40:10.315
Let all the children come for the puja.
