00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:14.512
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:29.153
There have been many incarnations of the Goddess

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:33.666
for different, different purposes.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:46.719
But when the great saints introspect themselves,

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.187
who were worshipping the Mother,

00:00:50.267 --> 00:01:00.766
they found out that what She has done for us.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.187
The other day I told you the dharma

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:12.820
is the innate valency of human beings. And they are ten.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.719
This is already established within us, but we deviate,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.753
deviate from dharma and all the problems come in,

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:32.100
because to leave the dharma is not a human quality.

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:41.053
But Goddess Herself has done so
many things for us already, within us,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:45.353
though we are not aware of it.

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:50.786
It is said that “ya Devi sarva bhuteshu” -

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:55.920
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.367
"What do You do? As what do
You exist inside the human beings? ”.

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:12.220
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.900
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:32.087
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu shanti rupena samstitha”.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:39.920
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.786
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:51.686
Very difficult. But She has given you that,

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:56.320
She has given you that peace which you have to achieve.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.753
Now it comes, because you have
fallen off your human dharmas.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:08.020
So this peace that She has given you, you have to achieve

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.986
through your ascent, through the Kundalini awakening.

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:24.053
You are excited, all right. Or, you want to take revenge,

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:31.187
you want to hurt others, you want to trouble others;

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:35.586
you enjoy sometimes, even as sahaja yogis

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:42.120
people enjoy hurting others, troubling others.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.153
So, the second one She says is:

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:53.153
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu pritti rupena samsthita”.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:57.653
Pritti is the quality of loving,

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:05.387
that a human being has been given the quality of loving.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:08.753
But, it’s not there.

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:15.833
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:22.586
Now, supposing I give some present to somebody,

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.153
and some present to another one.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:30.886
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel jealous. Very surprising.

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:36.820
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.686
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:49.320
But as sahaja yogis you should not do,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.753
because that quality that the
Goddess has given you is of loving.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:58.753
That quality should be shown - on
the contrary you are very jealous.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:04.220
That means you are not a sahaja
yogi, blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.953
If you are blessed, then you
will have no jealousy whatsoever.

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:13.986
And this jealousy sometimes it goes to this extent that

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:23.220
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.886
These so close to each other.

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:35.686
Just like the two nostrils
together. But there will be jealousy.

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:40.053
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:43.953
if You can go to that country”.

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:47.220
So this comes also from the ignorance that

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.020
“This is mine, this is mine, this is yours”.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:03.287
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:12.367
that She has given us the power
to love. Tremendous power to love.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.586
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:24.020
But auspicious, dharmic power to love somebody.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:31.686
Means without any lust and greed, without any jealousy.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:36.120
But the human mind has developed itself so cunning

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.253
that it is proud that it can be jealous of someone.

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:46.719
Out of this jealousy only greed comes in, as I told you.

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:52.353
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:55.653
Then you must compete with others.

00:06:55.733 --> 00:07:02.100
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.220
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:18.753
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:24.619
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu”, the saints have said it,

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:28.020
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.653
Kshama is what you call is the forgiveness.

00:07:34.733 --> 00:07:38.387
Forgiveness from the heart.

00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:43.853
All right, somebody has been
cruel to you, has been nasty to you,

00:07:43.933 --> 00:07:46.820
has exploited you, has troubled you,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.719
but you have the power, greater power to forgive.

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:58.333
Do we use that power to forgive?

00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:09.786
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:14.986
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu nidra rupena samsthita”.

00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:19.840
When you are tired and you can’t sleep

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.207
She makes you sleep. She relaxes
you. So the power of relaxation She does

00:08:26.287 --> 00:08:30.540
because She acts through parasympathetic nervous system.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.440
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.241
But the parasympathetic relaxes you, relaxes your heart,

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:45.440
relaxes your body and completely feel relaxed

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.473
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:54.573
But there are many people who cannot sleep.

00:08:54.653 --> 00:09:01.874
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

00:09:01.954 --> 00:09:07.107
If you cannot sleep, then something wrong with you.

00:09:07.187 --> 00:09:11.174
And when you cannot sleep I also cannot sleep.

00:09:11.254 --> 00:09:18.141
Whatever collectively happening also works on Me.

00:09:18.221 --> 00:09:24.874
Anything wrong you do, that
works on Me, specially collectively.

00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:32.640
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.974
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

00:09:35.054 --> 00:09:38.600
we know we have to go into thoughtless awareness.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:47.567
The most interesting thing that the Mother has put in you is

00:09:47.647 --> 00:09:53.867
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu bhranti rupena samsthita”.

00:09:53.947 --> 00:09:57.734
She puts you into delusion,

00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:02.334
because sometimes the children cannot understand

00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:08.834
unless and until they face the
delusion. They have to face the delusion.

00:10:08.914 --> 00:10:14.368
She allows, allows you to go wrong

00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:19.134
to a point where you discover you are lost.

00:10:19.214 --> 00:10:22.334
Very important it is that She plays,

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:26.134
this is the Mahamaya part as they say.

00:10:26.214 --> 00:10:30.301
And this is discussed in every religion

00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:35.168
that we get lost with this delusion.

00:10:35.248 --> 00:10:39.867
Now, what are the delusions we have?

00:10:39.947 --> 00:10:43.801
We have the delusions of ego.

00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:49.034
Ego for men as if they are very powerful,

00:10:49.114 --> 00:10:55.667
that they can do what they like and
they are not going to be punished for it.

00:10:55.747 --> 00:11:00.001
For women they too behave in the same manner.

00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:04.901
They don’t understand that this is a delusion

00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:13.334
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

00:11:13.414 --> 00:11:18.634
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

00:11:18.714 --> 00:11:23.700
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.934
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:33.801
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

00:11:33.881 --> 00:11:40.301
Then when you realize that you have been in a delusion,

00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:43.368
then only you can return back.

00:11:43.448 --> 00:11:47.834
Otherwise without any problem you cannot return.

00:11:47.914 --> 00:11:59.068
So many of you are so obstinate, so self-conscious.

00:11:59.148 --> 00:12:03.867
Whatever one may tell you, you will not listen.

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:10.368
Whatever way you may try to
convince, on a mental level, you won’t.

00:12:10.448 --> 00:12:16.368
So, the bhranti, the delusion, is beyond the mind.

00:12:16.448 --> 00:12:19.834
It is beyond the mind.

00:12:19.914 --> 00:12:27.134
It works out sometimes very well for difficult people.

00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:34.567
Now, when you are in a position of a Mother

00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:41.368
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

00:12:41.448 --> 00:12:45.901
She feels responsible, and She thinks that:

00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:49.967
“Now they have got connection with the Divine,

00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:53.368
and this connection should not be broken,

00:12:53.448 --> 00:12:58.600
that they should be all the time blessed and be happy.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.867
All this is within us,

00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:08.634
within us, built-in, from our very childhood,

00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:15.368
but we forget, slowly, slowly we start losing it.

00:13:15.448 --> 00:13:20.600
Maybe the conditioning is such or maybe the ego is such,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:28.234
and maybe that they forget that they are realized souls.

00:13:28.314 --> 00:13:34.168
I’m talking to you - to people who
are realized souls. I’m not talking

00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:40.901
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:45.268
But the way you are brought up, the way you have been told

00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:53.068
very sweetly with love, with affection, with kindness,

00:13:53.148 --> 00:13:58.700
and if you don’t understand that, then you go into bhranti.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.801
For example, it is also said that,

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:08.567
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:14.205
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe, it’s not shyness.

00:14:14.285 --> 00:14:23.214
It is a kind of a shame about your body.

00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:29.683
Now they have beauty contests.
India also they had beauty contest.

00:14:29.763 --> 00:14:32.850
Lajja rupena samsthita:

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:39.883
means you have to have shame of your body.

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:43.716
That’s specially for women.

00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:52.416
As a child you will see, women are very shy.

00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:55.483
See, little girls, they are very shy.

00:14:55.563 --> 00:14:58.449
That shyness gradually disappears,

00:14:58.529 --> 00:15:01.883
but in the beginning they are even shy of Me.

00:15:01.963 --> 00:15:06.416
They come before Me, they’ll put down their head.

00:15:06.496 --> 00:15:12.050
They’ll not even say Namaste. Very sweet.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.549
And they don’t like people wearing funny dresses.

00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:20.750
I remember My granddaughter once, she saw one magazine

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.649
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

00:15:25.729 --> 00:15:30.716
Better wear your dress, otherwise my
Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:35.750
To that lady was saying that; and
then she opened and saw a man’s dress

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.683
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

00:15:40.763 --> 00:15:44.750
And then she said, “This one is,
seems to be absolutely shameless fellow.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.016
He is going to have a bad time now.” And she closed it.

00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:51.783
And then she told the
maidservant, “Burn this, burn this off.

00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:58.683
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

00:15:58.763 --> 00:16:05.816
But the way nowadays we are
going about with the show of our body,

00:16:05.896 --> 00:16:14.583
and sometimes I feel that all these designers will die

00:16:14.663 --> 00:16:21.950
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.783
There is no space for any artist

00:16:26.863 --> 00:16:36.516
to show his work or to show his art how he can dress you up.

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:43.549
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:47.716
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

00:16:47.796 --> 00:16:55.783
done so well, very expensive
and it takes time to wear that?”.

00:16:55.863 --> 00:17:00.983
So they said that, “You see, if
God has made a beautiful body,

00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:04.716
then it is His art,

00:17:04.796 --> 00:17:12.449
and we have to make our art decorate it.

00:17:12.529 --> 00:17:17.416
So what we do is to make our art to decorate it.”

00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:21.649
I really liked it, because in India same thing.

00:17:21.729 --> 00:17:25.316
If there is a lady she has to wear a sari,

00:17:25.396 --> 00:17:28.883
which is being made very artfully, very beautifully,

00:17:28.963 --> 00:17:33.774
just to decorate her body, just to respect the body.

00:17:33.854 --> 00:17:41.540
It is all, you see occasions,
places which are to be celebrated.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.707
Like in India, when women go to the temple

00:17:44.787 --> 00:17:48.373
or to worship the idols or anything,

00:17:48.453 --> 00:17:56.774
then they will wear all that is
necessary to face the Goddess, after all.

00:17:56.854 --> 00:18:02.540
Imagine people coming for this program here wearing,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:09.707
I don’t know what they call it, but
like jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

00:18:09.787 --> 00:18:13.874
what would happen to Me? I would
disappear in thin air, I can tell you this much.

00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:16.907
So, one has to have respect for the body.

00:18:16.987 --> 00:18:23.707
That is what She has said first
- that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:18:23.787 --> 00:18:29.707
Now you might say that there are
people who are taking the bath in the river

00:18:29.787 --> 00:18:34.041
and this and that, and give justification.

00:18:34.121 --> 00:18:38.707
But you are saints! You are realized souls!

00:18:38.787 --> 00:18:41.874
You don’t have to see those people who are not yet realized

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.440
and who are misbehaving.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.640
You must do what a saint should do.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.841
There are so many qualities that the Goddess has given you.

00:18:55.921 --> 00:19:00.741
Another is kshudha rupena samstitha.

00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:07.273
She’s the One who has given us
hunger. We have to eat our food.

00:19:07.353 --> 00:19:11.373
Nowadays there’s a fashion of
becoming thin or whatever you may call.

00:19:11.453 --> 00:19:14.907
And you know so many diseases have developed.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:20.340
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.707
You can change the things that you are eating,

00:19:24.787 --> 00:19:30.407
but it’s not the aim of life to only look after your body.

00:19:30.487 --> 00:19:38.373
Body is not the only important
thing. What is important is your Spirit.

00:19:38.453 --> 00:19:43.007
And She is the One who gives you the Kundalini.

00:19:43.087 --> 00:19:47.907
She is the One who give you a method by which you’ll ascend.

00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:52.454
But all the time worried about their body.

00:19:52.534 --> 00:19:57.520
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.387
I think today I have made it very clear to you

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:08.387
what qualities already are instilled within you.

00:20:08.467 --> 00:20:14.854
They are there. They are not dharmas, but qualities.

00:20:14.934 --> 00:20:17.487
They are just within you,

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:24.153
only thing you have turned your
attention to something opposite,

00:20:24.233 --> 00:20:29.220
otherwise all these qualities
are already instilled within you.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:36.354
They are already there. And nothing
can destroy them, except for you yourself.

00:20:36.434 --> 00:20:40.887
If you have destroyed them, nobody can help.

00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:42.726
May God bless you all.
