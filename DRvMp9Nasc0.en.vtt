01:03:17.399 --> 01:03:28.399
Actually, the music is divine and you feel you are in paradise, the way it was rendered.

01:03:28.399 --> 01:03:35.959
The Adivadaya is played before you.

01:03:35.959 --> 01:03:39.599
I have no words to describe My joy.

01:03:39.599 --> 01:03:46.959
I'm only sorry that people have no sense of understanding this great music that is in

01:03:46.959 --> 01:03:47.959
our country.

01:03:47.959 --> 01:03:56.119
If they listen to this music, they'll have no diseases, no heart attacks, nothing.

01:03:56.119 --> 01:04:05.339
This is absolutely divine and people should take to it in such a way that it's a blessing

01:04:05.339 --> 01:04:09.639
of God that we have such great artists in our country existing.

01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:17.479
My heart binds to see such great artists not being properly recognized, appreciated and

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:18.479
worshipped.

01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:26.359
I'm sure one day they will come and they will go all over the world and play this beautiful

01:04:26.359 --> 01:04:32.519
praise of Saraswati.

01:04:32.519 --> 01:04:39.919
You must know that the only way we can keep healthy is through our music, our talas, our

01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:41.459
dancing.

01:04:41.459 --> 01:04:49.359
This is the blessing of our ancient gurus and we should not try to go to these Adogati

01:04:49.359 --> 01:04:52.359
people of the West and spoil ourselves.

01:04:52.359 --> 01:04:56.959
On the contrary, they will appreciate it thousand times more than we can appreciate.

01:04:56.959 --> 01:05:00.079
May God bless them all and bless you all that you are appreciating.

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:01.079
It's tremendous.

01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:02.459
I have no words to express.

01:05:02.459 --> 01:05:07.419
The greatest joy I have felt today with this beautiful music rendering.

01:05:07.419 --> 01:05:08.942
May God bless you all.
