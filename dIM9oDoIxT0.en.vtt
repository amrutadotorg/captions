00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:34.160
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:45.180
You have just now heard that within us lies
the power of our ascent, ascent to the Divine.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.660
Now maybe there are some people who can say
"How?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.570
How do You say that?

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.220
What's Your authority?"

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.269
Naturally, one can ask such a question.

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:13.979
But as a scientist we have to keep our minds
open to any knowledge.

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:17.880
I say this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.570
Why?

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.180
Whatever we have known so far is the knowledge
of the tree.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:34.370
It sounds fantastic sometimes to people how
can the awakening of the Kundalini or the

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:41.990
Holy Ghost as described in the Bible can bring
forth this tremendous change; this transformation

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:55.060
and all the benefits of physical, mental,
emotional and material being within us.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:04.230
It's impossible to believe because it's too
fantastic.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:10.150
But we don't realize that how fantastically
we are made by God Almighty.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:16.220
We take Him so much for granted.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.730
When we make a computer in this world we feel
we have done a great job.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:30.729
But do you know you yourself you are a computer
which knows without thinking.

00:16:30.729 --> 00:16:33.580
I see you and I know I see you.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:40.150
I don't have to go back to some sort of a
programming to find out what am I seeing;

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.380
is also spontaneous and living.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:50.320
All the living things are created by the living
God and then we know that we have come to

00:16:50.320 --> 00:17:02.060
this stage of human awareness; from here if
we have to ascend, there must be some method,

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.870
mechanism within us.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.560
Now some may say that why should we seek.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.310
There's no why about it.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:19.200
Because you see the confusion all along, you
see what's happening to people.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.810
There are so many thought waves coming up
like 'we must look after our health', 'we

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.470
must look after our mind'.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:37.190
There are so many sorts of theologies and
also many intellectual expositions and manifestations;

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:42.270
that one gets absolutely confounded and can't
understand where are we.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:51.940
Naturally in this confusion one feels very
frustrated and wants to find out what are

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.460
we here for?

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.760
Any intelligent sincere person, honest person
thinks that way.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.760
'Why am I here?'

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:08.690
Of course for the frivolous, they can manage
for some time.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:17.620
They can continue for one or two lives till
they become little bit concerned but normally

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:25.879
any intelligent person would think that I
have been made a human being for what?

00:18:25.879 --> 00:18:35.279
What is the purpose of my being a human being
from the animal stage?

00:18:35.279 --> 00:18:42.569
Then people say that you are a human being
now you forget about your creator; you forget

00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:46.810
about anything like that and you think you
are the creator.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:51.929
You just believe that you are the one who
has to rule the whole world.

00:18:51.929 --> 00:18:58.719
That's how we create a barrier between ourselves
and the truth.

00:18:58.719 --> 00:19:06.369
The truth exists and God exists whether we
believe in it or not.

00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:10.560
Actually blind faith is not going to take
us to God.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:16.580
The faith has to be based on experience which
is called as 'shraddha'.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.250
It has to be based on experience of the truth.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:26.769
Supposing, I have not been to this room; I
have not seen it; I don't know what it is

00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:30.900
and I started describing it and if you believe
Me, then I would say it's just a brain wash

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:37.730
and it has been nothing but a talk and talk
and talk about God throughout.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:47.779
The reason was the human beings were not ready
at that time I should say to get to their

00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:48.779
Realization.

00:19:48.779 --> 00:20:03.779
We had few people very few in the last say
sixth to the modern times.

00:20:03.779 --> 00:20:08.809
I asked a Zen master, "How many realized souls
you had?

00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:09.809
'Kashyapas'"

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:16.510
And he said, "We had altogether only twenty
four 'Kashyapas' from the sixth Century to

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.529
the thirteenth Century and we had none."

00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:21.409
So I said, "Then what are you doing there?

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:24.650
You are a Zen Master and you are not a realized
soul."

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.640
So he said, "I am doing my job."

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:37.489
A priest, I must say John Clover is also a
priest; and a priest very well known personality

00:20:37.489 --> 00:20:42.469
and I asked him, "What do you mean by Holy
Ghost?"

00:20:42.469 --> 00:20:47.590
So he says, "I am agnostic."

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.280
I said, "Then, what are you doing in the church?"

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:56.270
So he says "I am doing my job."

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.270
I was surprised!

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:03.879
What sort of a job you can do when you do
not know what you are talking?

00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:08.950
You are professing something about which you
yourself are not sure.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:16.240
You yourself you are not a free soul and you
are talking about freedom of the soul; is

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.290
something like a advertising department.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:26.859
So people start wondering, is there anything
like God?

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:30.730
And no wonder that so many have discarded
as nothing.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:37.319
But the time has come now to prove the existence
of God.

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:44.599
The time has now come to prove all the miracles
of the scriptures.

00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:49.529
At this time only there's a controversy should
come up that there were no miracles and the

00:21:49.529 --> 00:21:51.390
time has come to prove that.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:58.969
Isn't it surprising that spontaneously at
this time only all these intellectuals are

00:21:58.969 --> 00:22:03.529
coming out with their novel ideas?

00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:09.460
And that this is the time we can prove it
that there is God.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:15.860
We can prove it that there is Kundalini, the
Holy Ghost and we can prove it that there

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:22.969
is Spirit and that a human being can ascend.

00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:32.249
I think the background is so dark that the
light will show better and that has to happen.

00:22:32.249 --> 00:22:47.139
In these modern times, I find if you talk
to anybody about God, they will laugh at you.

00:22:47.139 --> 00:22:57.460
Is not regarded fashionable to talk about
God but despite of all that in the modern

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.520
times we have the maximum numbers of seekers.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.550
We never had so many seekers at any time.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:15.020
Think of Christ, he had those twelve disciples
who did not believe in Him till they saw His

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.020
resurrection.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.950
I mean they did not believe in Him fully,
I mean to say.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:25.270
Look at Buddha or look at anyone of these
people.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.870
Mohammad Saab, how they tortured his life?

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:40.330
And they all have talked about this time as
the resurrection time because before the doomsday

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.590
the resurrection has to come.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:50.680
But the people who are in-charge of the, there
are people who have taken their charge in

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.680
this world.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:57.670
Will not believe that there can be redemption,
that there could be resurrection because it's

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.260
a money making proposition.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:13.640
I met a Mayor today in the morning of another
place and he told Me, he asked Me actually

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.580
"Why people become so fanatic about religion?"

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:26.050
I said, "Because it is a money making proposition
everywhere".

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:32.000
Any money making proposition has to be fanatic
because you have to be successful money wise

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.790
and also compromising.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:41.960
It's an enterprise and God doesn't understand
money, that's the worst part of it.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.400
He doesn't know what money is.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:57.590
He does all that is living what human beings
do is nothing but they convert dead to another

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.170
dead.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:06.580
Now for example some tree is dead, we make
a bench out of it; from dead to dead.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.310
But can we transform these flowers into fruits?

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.870
We do not.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:25.420
And the one who does billions and billions
of these at the time, at the right time, proper

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:33.380
seasons, who must be that?

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:40.620
Whatever we have done so far is the dead work.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:48.430
But the work of God is the living work and
the living work of God is evident in our own

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:56.760
existence that we have become human beings
from amoeba stage and that if higher ascent

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:05.960
has to take place it has to take place through
some spontaneous happening meaning living

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:14.690
happening not by some artificial things like
in the Hindu religion we have a ceremony called

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:21.810
as 'munja' where the, at eight years of age
they say the child has now become a Brahmin,

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:29.380
means he has known the all pervading power
of Brahma, of Holy Ghost, certified.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:35.310
As we have in Christian religion also in the
churches they'll put their hand and your head

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:41.770
and say now you have become Christian, Baptized.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.080
How Sir?

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.940
Just an exercise and we believe in it.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.440
We accept the situation and we believe that
we are that.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:59.900
Mohammad Saab has said, "You have to become
the Pir."

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:07.120
There's no religion which has not said that
human awareness is for just balancing yourself.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.210
That's the religion is.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:14.801
It's like trial and error and trial and error;
that you make mistakes improve yourself, make

00:27:14.801 --> 00:27:16.470
mistakes improve yourself.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:23.020
You move from one extreme to another as you
see here to the left or to the right and then

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:32.290
you come to the center and the central path
of ascent is within us and which we achieve

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:40.210
through our moderation and not through our
extremes and those who go to extremes and

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:50.040
become fanatic are people who are not religious
by any chance because religion must give you

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.040
a balance.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:28:00.290
That's the first thing one must attain, attain
through religion.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:10.400
Now within us lies the power of our ascent
and the path of our ascent and on this path

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:19.350
we have got different centers which represent
something very subtle within us.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:25.930
As I told you this is the knowledge of the
roots.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:30.580
Supposing a tree is sick we see the leaves
are falling.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.580
So we take one leaf.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:37.030
First of all once if we pluck it out it is
already finished.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:44.200
But even on the tree we try to inject something
to the leaf, does it reach the whole of the

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200
tree?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.630
It does not.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.630
If you have to cure that tree, you have to
go to the roots.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:29:00.130
In the same way within ourselves these centers
are placed and the root has to be awakened

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:08.970
so that it passes through all these centers,
enlightens all these centers and give you

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:18.270
the ultimate that we call as the true Baptism
or Self Realization or in Sanskrit knowledge

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.459
they say 'Atma Sakshathkar'.

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:25.040
Now where does the Spirit reside?

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.180
The Spirit resides in our heart.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.540
Now this is a hypothesis for you.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.890
You need not accept.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.209
But keep your mind open for it.

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:40.260
But the seat of God almighty is on top of
your head though the reflection of that as

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.709
the Spirit is in the heart.

00:29:42.709 --> 00:29:49.940
When this Kundalini which is called as the
Root also or is called as the Holy Ghost,

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:56.070
which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,
which is the power of God, which is the Primodial

00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:09.480
Mother, which is your individual Mother rises
and when it touches that point the Spirit

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.510
in your heart starts emitting these cool vibrations.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:21.530
First you feel it here coming out of your
head, the Cool Breeze.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.530
This happens.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:30.560
This is not artificial you can even see in
many people the pulsation of the Kundalini

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:37.291
very clearly just like a heart or in that
bone, which is just a bone; pulsates like

00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:45.019
a heart, when there is an obstruction in the
higher centers.

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:54.310
Now the subtle side of these centers are that
the first center is related to our innocence.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:31:04.330
Have we bothered to find out how are we innocent
in our childhood?

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:10.850
What is that creates innocence within us?

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:20.820
Then the second center that we have is the
center of Swadishthana which deals with the

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.719
creativity that we have.

00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:27.719
Now God has made human beings in his image.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:34.020
He has the same centers within Him which He
reflects within us.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.309
So with this center He has created all this
universe.

00:31:38.309 --> 00:31:41.160
This is for the creativity.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:49.599
The third center within us, which is the naval
center, which looks after the solar plexus

00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:57.310
on the gross, is called as the Nabhi Chakra
meaning the naval center and is responsible

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.630
for giving us the seeking.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:05.080
We should know why do we seek.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.809
Why do we seek food to begin with?

00:32:07.809 --> 00:32:14.530
We feel hungry, but how do we know that we
are hungry and that we want food?

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:19.890
Even a child knows that, even an animal knows
that; how?

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:26.609
This is the center tells us that now you are
hungry better go and have some food.

00:32:26.609 --> 00:32:35.380
And this is the center tells us now you better
seek some money, maybe some power, maybe all

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:42.290
the human things that we seek and waste our
life quite a lot in that.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:48.449
After that when you are affluent when you
have solved all these mundane things like

00:32:48.449 --> 00:32:51.010
no more we are living in the jungles like
animals.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:57.479
Then we start thinking that there must be
something beyond because I have got everything

00:32:57.479 --> 00:33:02.040
now but I haven't got joy.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.910
I don't feel joyous.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.179
I am not satisfied, what is that?

00:33:08.179 --> 00:33:14.989
When this seeking starts then you are a special
category of seekers for which William Blake

00:33:14.989 --> 00:33:24.070
has clearly written very, very clearly two
hundred years back he said that men of God

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:31.579
will become prophets and they will have powers
to make others prophets and that is today's

00:33:31.579 --> 00:33:32.859
Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:32.859 --> 00:33:42.200
This seeking is a special category of people
who we find now a days all over the world.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:50.200
That's why I said it at the very outset that
you do not find so many seekers, in the history

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.840
of spirituality so many seekers.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:34:00.699
But today there are thousands and thousands;
I would say millions and millions of seekers.

00:34:00.699 --> 00:34:03.979
But what happens to them?

00:34:03.979 --> 00:34:09.120
Again they get lost.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:18.589
Some start getting lost in the intellectual
understanding of God, finished.

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.290
How can you understand God with this limited
brain?

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.270
He's unlimited.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:26.500
You have to go beyond this mind to understand.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:40.849
What can we understand of that God who does
all these marvelous things of living processes

00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:47.799
which we cannot do even a wee bit with this
brain of ours?

00:34:47.799 --> 00:34:55.959
So some are lost in the books and some are
lost in the organized religions, finished.

00:34:55.959 --> 00:35:03.280
Sunday morning have a nice dress, go to the
church, I have done my work as far as God

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.280
is concerned.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:12.900
Or I would say for a Hindu is to go to the
temple, take some money give it to the Brahmin

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.469
there, done.

00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:19.030
So they are also lost in it.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.540
Then there are lots of markets now a days.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:34.919
We have 'spiritualists' and we have 'charismatics'
and we have got 'seventh day adventist' and

00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:36.799
'born again'; all sorts.

00:35:36.799 --> 00:35:43.830
They are only same people with different brands.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:50.020
There's no difference between one human being
and another, even if you put any brand on

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.309
our head we are just the same.

00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:57.599
There is no difference at all.

00:35:57.599 --> 00:36:06.290
They may profess something, but whatever you
profess is not within you.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:13.070
So it is not what you profess is important,
but what you become.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.669
Becoming is the point.

00:36:17.669 --> 00:36:23.859
What you become on your central nervous system.

00:36:23.859 --> 00:36:26.199
That is the evolutionary impact.

00:36:26.199 --> 00:36:35.239
When we evolve from animal to human state
it is expressed on our central nervous system.

00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:42.349
For example if you have to take a dog through
a dirty lane, he has no objection, he just

00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:43.630
walks through.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.799
But we cannot go.

00:36:44.799 --> 00:36:50.929
Now you bring a dog here in a good garden,
he's quite happy, he doesn't know whether

00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:55.059
it is a beautiful garden of flowers or it's
a dirty lane.

00:36:55.059 --> 00:37:01.690
But for a human being this awareness is there
and he can feel it.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:07.199
Now to human beings if you talk of sin this
that, they don't understand.

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:08.290
They'll say, "What's wrong?

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:09.290
What's wrong?"

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.479
"If I kill somebody what's wrong?"

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:13.130
"If I do like this what's wrong?"

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:18.469
Because the awareness is at that level.

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:21.429
But Christ, would He do such a thing?

00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:24.949
Buddha, would He do such a thing?

00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:27.809
Khalil Gibran, would he do such a thing?

00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:30.329
William Blake?

00:37:30.329 --> 00:37:32.849
No, why?

00:37:32.849 --> 00:37:40.400
Because they are above us and their sense
and sensitivity has developed in such a manner

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.880
that they are the people who know what is
right and what is wrong.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.370
So we live in a relative world.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.000
We must accept this.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.839
We have no sense of absolute and even if we
have it is told to us from our fathers, forefathers

00:37:56.839 --> 00:38:03.420
or in the church or in the temple somewhere;
is all conditioning.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:12.939
We do not know for definite whether it is
right or wrong because we haven't got that

00:38:12.939 --> 00:38:13.939
awareness.

00:38:13.939 --> 00:38:22.829
So what has to happen to you is that you have
to become collectively conscious that means

00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:26.489
you can feel your own centers on your finger
tips.

00:38:26.489 --> 00:38:34.390
That is Self-Realization, you know your Self
and you should feel the centers of other people

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:44.709
on your finger tips and so that you know what
is wrong with another person or what is wrong

00:38:44.709 --> 00:38:45.709
with you.

00:38:45.709 --> 00:38:50.390
But you are so much separated from yourself
like it becomes your cloth, the whole body,

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:58.059
the ego, the superego that you know it is
wrong and you clear it out, if you know the

00:38:58.059 --> 00:38:59.059
technique.

00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:02.460
This is the another meaning of the word Yoga.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:10.750
The first meaning is that Yoga is the union
with the Divine; also Yoga means to be deft

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:22.650
in the art of God's love, in the technique
of Divine laws; this is the another meaning.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.030
Yoga doesn't mean standing on your head.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:36.599
That's just a misnomer, because some people
have got very little knowledge about things

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:39.580
and they start saying this is Yoga.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:45.479
But I mean Patanjali who has talked about
it thousands of years back has described nothing

00:39:45.479 --> 00:39:54.290
but Sahaja Yoga; is the spontaneous union,
spontaneous union with the Divine.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.549
That's what he has described out and out but
who reads that big book.

00:39:58.549 --> 00:40:03.920
Yoga you can buy in three pages you see.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:11.419
Stand on your head; bend your feet, but why?

00:40:11.419 --> 00:40:17.929
We too have to do some exercises in Sahaja
Yoga but the Kundalini has to rise and tell

00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:22.689
us where it is obstructed accordingly we do
the exercise.

00:40:22.689 --> 00:40:28.800
Supposing you have a trouble on your head
and you do the stomach exercises, the stomach

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.189
will be spoilt for nothing at all.

00:40:31.189 --> 00:40:35.819
As it is you have a headache plus the stomach
is also spoilt.

00:40:35.819 --> 00:40:39.039
So it is a big science one has to understand.

00:40:39.039 --> 00:40:41.540
But it is so simple as a child.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:51.280
Now this child is a realized soul he knows
because you become the absolute.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:59.020
Now if you want to know whether there is God
or not you just put your hands like this and

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.000
ask the question, "Mother is there God?"

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.069
When you ask the question you'll get tremendous
Cool Breeze flowing.

00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:11.510
Is like a computer, an absolute computer.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.329
Now you ask a question, "Was Christ the son
of God?"

00:41:16.329 --> 00:41:22.319
You get tremendous; but ask about Rasputin
"Was he a saint?"

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:31.219
I don't want to ask because it might burn
My hand.

00:41:31.219 --> 00:41:36.829
That's how you know the absolute.

00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:43.069
Afterwards you don't need also to use the
hands, just without that you know and that

00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:50.280
is what the state one has to achieve, that
is the final break-through we have to achieve

00:41:50.280 --> 00:42:00.020
because this modern times as they say, these
are the times that are described as the resurrection

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:10.709
time, the judgment time and this is the time
that people have to judge themselves.

00:42:10.709 --> 00:42:13.640
Your own Spirit will judge you.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.780
Nobody is going to put you on a weighing machine
to see what have you got.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.419
Your own centers will be judged by you yourself.

00:42:23.419 --> 00:42:29.089
You become your own master, your own Guru
and you judge yourself and correct it.

00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:31.229
You judge others and correct it.

00:42:31.229 --> 00:42:39.349
But you don't tell them, you speak in a strange
language as the disciples of Christ spoke.

00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:41.320
You talk in the language of centers.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.320
Like you ask somebody, "What's the matter
with this person?"

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.739
So he'll say, "His left Vishuddhi is catching."

00:42:48.739 --> 00:42:50.949
Means he feels guilty.

00:42:50.949 --> 00:42:55.530
If you feel guilty your left Vishuddhi catches.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:43:01.659
We went to Nottingham today and there was
a taxi fellow who came in.

00:43:01.659 --> 00:43:09.299
We sat in the car and I knew he was a realized
soul.

00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:10.550
And he started talking to Me.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:21.289
He also took to Me easily and he confessed
to Me, "Mother I am a healer."

00:43:21.289 --> 00:43:24.863
I knew he was a, everybody knew that he was
a realized soul.

00:43:24.863 --> 00:43:28.579
He did not know much about it because he's
not a Sahaja Yogi to know all the deftness

00:43:28.579 --> 00:43:29.579
of it.

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:36.289
But he knew that he was something different
and a very gentle and a sweet personality

00:43:36.289 --> 00:43:37.530
he had.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:38.815
And while talking I asked him, "What's the
matter with you?

00:43:38.815 --> 00:43:39.815
Why do you feel so guilty?"

00:43:39.815 --> 00:43:43.290
He said, "I don't know but I feel like a criminal."

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.959
I said, "Why?"

00:43:45.959 --> 00:43:48.359
"Because everybody thinks I am queer."

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:56.479
I said, "In a lunatic asylum if a saint man
goes everybody thinks that he is insane.

00:43:56.479 --> 00:44:01.150
So you must not feel that way, you should
have all full confidence in yourself."

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.939
But he was so surprised that I could tell
all these things about him.

00:44:04.939 --> 00:44:09.989
I said, "Anybody would say because we know
what you feel on your finger tips.

00:44:09.989 --> 00:44:13.459
It's nothing great that we are doing."

00:44:13.459 --> 00:44:17.719
Because supposing, dog cannot talk to us,
but supposing we tell the dog that this is

00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:19.520
music, Indian music.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:26.150
He will ask, "How do you know it is Indian
music?"

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.151
Because we know, we can hear.

00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:30.660
You can't hear; you cannot differentiate.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:35.710
But we don't take such pride in saying that
we know this color or we know that thing and

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.000
we know what is art, what is not.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.479
We think it is our own right to know and we
know it.

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:48.900
In the same way once you get your Realization
you just know it because you become.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:59.939
So becoming is the main thing that you become
a realized soul, a saint, a sage, a seer,

00:44:59.939 --> 00:45:07.130
but as a result of this awakening because
it passes through various centers, into various

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.130
layers.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:14.780
First thing that happens to you; first thing
I must say that you get your physical body

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.780
cured.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:21.079
That's how Sahaja Yoga cures cancer.

00:45:21.079 --> 00:45:23.449
What is so great about it?

00:45:23.449 --> 00:45:28.900
It does and it's only this Sahaja Yoga that
is going to cure cancer.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.010
Otherwise you'll take chemotherapy, loose
your hair, then they'll cut your throat and

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:40.849
cut your nose and you'll end up by parts,
you see and when one will die it won't be

00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:42.140
in one piece.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:49.099
But in Sahaja Yoga the Kundalini rises and
she supplies the necessary vital forces to

00:45:49.099 --> 00:45:54.770
all these centers and you get cured.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:46:02.529
Practically everything that is to be repaired
can be repaired if the stage is not very much

00:46:02.529 --> 00:46:03.529
advanced.

00:46:03.529 --> 00:46:09.719
If the stage is very much advanced then the
Divine takes a decision that let this body

00:46:09.719 --> 00:46:14.099
die and come back again in a fresher way.

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:19.209
Then it allows it to die.

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:26.620
But mostly if it is in a repairing stage without
taking any medicine, without going to any

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:32.199
doctor, without anything you can cure yourself.

00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:36.270
It's not difficult.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:42.510
It transforms your personality in the sense
that your priorities change completely.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.609
I don't have to tell you 'don't do this'.

00:46:44.609 --> 00:46:47.589
That I will not say because then half of you
may run away.

00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:58.309
But it will happen in such a manner that you
yourself won't do that.

00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:59.679
I don't have to tell you at all.

00:46:59.679 --> 00:47:07.679
Because firstly if you try to do it you will
lose your vibrations you feel unhappy.

00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:17.640
You'll lose your joy and peace and maybe your
body may react and that it may vomit out the

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:29.169
thing or it may make you very painful so that
you just don't do it.

00:47:29.169 --> 00:47:31.559
You become righteousness, you become virtuous
and you enjoy your virtues.

00:47:31.559 --> 00:47:35.929
You don't force your virtues on others you
just say that one day he should get Realization.

00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:48.400
The concern is as if a part of your body is
sick and you want to soothe it and put it

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400
right.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.400
No obligation, nothing.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:58.650
If somebody is drowning himself actually part
of you is getting drowned that's why you jump

00:47:58.650 --> 00:47:59.959
into it.

00:47:59.959 --> 00:48:08.489
But here actually you feel the another person
and if you know how to cure that then there's

00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:11.839
no obligation at all because there is a part
and parcel of your being.

00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:12.839
Supposing this finger is paining and if I
rub it.

00:48:12.839 --> 00:48:14.480
Am I obliging myself?

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:21.849
But it is so spontaneous it is so automatic
that the idea also doesn't come into your

00:48:21.849 --> 00:48:23.990
head that you have obliged him.

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.960
It's so simple.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.690
This is the power of God's love.

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.040
We have never used that before because we
were not capable of doing that.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:39.540
All these wars and all these problems of the
world are because we are using the power of

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.540
hatred.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:49.200
We talk of peace but how will you make peace
on this earth when the people are so disturbed?

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:59.020
The source of peace is the Spirit and if the
whole world or a part of it and a very wee

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:07.790
part of it accepts that they should have their
Spirit manifesting and they establish themselves

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:08.790
you'll see all these problems will vanish
into thin air.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:12.810
As it is in your private life they vanish
out.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:15.740
Everything becomes smooth joyous happy.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:33.710
The relationships become very pure and you
really enjoy human beings for the first time.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.600
Otherwise it is just we'll say "Oh we are
brothers, brothers, brothers.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.510
We are sisters, we are this that."

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:46.150
When it comes to selfishness everything drops
out because it's just a mental projection.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:50.600
Even countries will say we are all friends,
we are going to help, but when it comes to

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.210
something important they drop out.

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.780
But this is no mental projection, is reality.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:50:06.640
Become that and that should happen to many,
many people by that a kind of a catalysism

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:12.430
will take place and the whole world has to
be changed as promised.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:20.670
Those days are ahead, is working out very
well, I have worked in this England for ten

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.670
years.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:32.350
In India hardly two years, but thousands and
thousands in the villages are now Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:33.901
They have given up all their bad habits.

00:50:33.901 --> 00:50:37.350
They have become masters of themselves.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:43.010
Even I would say in England we have quite
a lot of Sahaja Yogis, but still is a very

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:50.080
important place is England because it plays
a very important role in spirituality because

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:58.890
it is the heart of the universe and the heart
has to pump out the truth.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.750
It's pumping out all kind of nonsense on the
television.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:09.250
Today on the television they gave Me hardly
thirty seconds first and then three minutes.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:19.630
What do I do in three minutes, but for a joker
or a clown or for absolutely useless person

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.980
there will be hours together.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:33.220
This is the problem that we have to face,
but I am sure when the chaos will be seen

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:42.760
clearly people will ask for the answer and
when they seek that they will receive what

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.970
they are seeking.

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:49.990
That is a promise and the promise has to be
fulfilled.

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:54.670
All that is promised in the scriptures has
to be fulfilled.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:59.490
May God bless you all.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:05.270
Now if you have any problems please ask me.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.560
Today I had a very, very hectic day.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:17.770
The whole day I have been moving from places
to places and somehow you have been so kind

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:23.810
to come here and I am sure we'll get the experience
tonight.

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:30.600
But in any case if you have any questions
please ask.

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.740
Is important.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:47.500
From the seekers: May I ask a question Mataji?

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:52.050
Mother: Yes please.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:58.630
From the seekers: Is it possible to awaken
Kundalini without a spring guidance like You

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:01.830
because You are not available to us so only
by reading books?

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:02.830
Mother: Yes it is possible.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:03.830
Only

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.830
Sahaja Yogi: 'Only by reading books' she said

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:05.830
Mother: By reading books.

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:06.830
No, no, no not at all.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:07.830
Kabir Das has said "Padhi, padhi pandita murakha
bhayei".

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:09.130
That by reading too much even the learned
have become stupid.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:15.910
Seeker: So how could we have Divine guidance
like You?

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:21.900
Mother: What you have to do first of all is
to know that it's a living process and for

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.760
any living process you don't need mental understanding.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:33.300
Just I have talked to you because after all
you are very intelligent people.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.110
But supposing we want to sprout a seed what
do we do?

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:43.410
We put it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:46.970
Do we give it a lecture before hand?

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:52.300
All right do we do anything?

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:57.960
It is built-in in the seed as well as in the
Mother Earth the capacity to do it.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:05.251
So of course you have to have somebody who
has the capacity.

00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:06.251
Satguru is the real Guru.

00:54:06.251 --> 00:54:08.680
But these days they are all in the market;
all making money.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:14.870
First thing is no money can be paid for sprouting
of the seed; first principle.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:26.040
Ninety nine point nine percent [99.9%] will
drop out on that point and is said that 'Sahib

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.040
Milaye'.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:32.910
The one who makes you meet the Divine is the
Guru.

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.280
The one who talks and gives lecture is not
the Guru.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:42.840
But these days there are some very great Gurus
but they are hiding themselves in the Himalayas

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:48.190
and I sent one of them with great request
to America that please go and do some work

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.220
in America I won't be able to go.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.810
He stayed in New York for three days and ran
back into Himalayas.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:59.290
He said, "The people are at a very lower level
you see, they just talk of dollar."

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:01.750
He ran away.

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:09.880
So they don't want to deal just now perhaps
maybe after sometime if they see that the

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.200
area is all right, they may come down.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:16.210
But there are many great saints all over the
world.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:18.800
But sort of they have receded themselves.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:29.410
First you all become saints and they will
all come to join.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:35.330
Seeker: To become saint is very difficult.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:38.000
Mother: Who told you that?

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Seeker: Afreed

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Mother: It is the easiest thing.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.130
Living process is the easiest.

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:45.040
But we are so difficult we don't want to eat
like this we want to go round and eat, then

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.700
say...It is the simplest thing.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:53.160
'Sahaja Samadhi Lago', Sahaja you get it.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:59.390
Is said by everyone who said it is difficult?

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:02.870
Who has said it tell me?

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:04.030
No one.

00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:08.680
'Ek hi akshar premaka pade so pandita ho'.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.000
Who has said it?

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.330
Did Christ say so?

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:15.650
Did Buddha say so?

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:16.650
Nobody said.

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:24.060
But they could not do it because people were
difficult.

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:31.940
So they said all right go ahead, carry on.

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:38.020
Krishna at the very outset of Gita he said
that you find yourself.

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.930
You become a 'sthita pragya'.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:44.430
You become a realized soul, at the very outset.

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:51.260
But Arjuna says, "But how You are telling
me to go on war and here You are telling me

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.080
to become 'saakshi', the witness?"

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.930
Krishna was a Father.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:57:01.980
He said, 'This gentleman won't understand
in a straight way.'

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:07.410
Because Krishna is a special incarnation of
diplomacy, he understand how human beings

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:08.620
are, like a Father you see.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.630
He won't tell straight forward.

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:13.310
He will say 'all right you want to do it go
ahead.'

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:16.620
You want to jump in the sea go ahead.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:23.980
So He said, "All right," it's very interesting
we don't understand Gita also without Realization.

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:31.320
Like a father who comes out of his house and
sees his son trying to drive the cart.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:37.180
So he says, "All right you want to drive the
cart please put the horse before the cart."

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:43.170
But the son says, "No I can put the horse
behind and drive the cart."

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:46.930
He said, "All right do it no harm.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.640
Only put your attention there."

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.620
So he says that, "All right you do all your
work, but put it at the Lotus Feet of the

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:54.620
God."

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:58.330
You cannot do it, is an absurd condition.

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:02.180
You cannot do it; absurd condition.

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.890
But when you get your Realization you don't
say "I do it".

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:07.970
You say, "It's going", "it's coming", "it's
working", "it's happening".

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:10.760
You become a third person; 'akarm'.

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:15.250
The second he said about 'bhakti' is the devotion.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:24.620
He said 'pushpam; all the flowers and fruits
and all these you give Me, I take them' but

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.810
where did He play?

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:34.330
On the word 'ananya' means you have to do
the devotion when you are not the other 'ananya'.

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.600
Now when are you like that?

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:46.520
When you are one within and also is logical
that unless and until you are connected within

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.650
what sort of a bhakti [devotion] you are doing
here?

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:51.890
You must be connected.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:56.470
Only 'bhakti' you can do is to say that "Connect
me".

00:58:56.470 --> 00:59:00.810
But otherwise if you are not connected, if
the telephone is not connected what are you

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:01.810
telephoning?

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:07.190
Is as simple as that, is very logical.

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:17.910
So the whole 'Karma Yoga' and 'Bhakti Yoga'
is nothing but that you get your Self-Realization

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:19.810
first.

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:37.930
Now this is the problem with human beings
that they want to live on words, but how long?

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:39.450
Nothing is difficult.

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:41.980
So far I have not seen it is a difficult thing
to do.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:42.980
It has worked out.

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:43.980
Any other question please?

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:54.140
[From the audience someone asks a question
related to astrology, the question is not

00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.590
audible]

00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:14.850
Mother: Is of no consequence.

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:22.440
Seeker: Is of no consequence?

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.090
Mother: No consequence
This is very subtle, above everything else,

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:26.090
makes no difference.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:36.070
But later on I find because we are problematic
people and the Kundalini comes down to help

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:37.940
you in different places.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:47.510
And I find that sometimes the people how they
are made at their birth by astrology behave

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.800
in different manners.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:59.390
But still the sign and all these things that
are so gross do not bind you.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:07.650
You just throw them away and get out of it.

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:13.690
So it's nothing important.

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:17.306
You go beyond all stars, beyond all science
and things.

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:36.300
It is of help in a way; for example they cast
My horoscope in India and they discovered

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:42.300
something about Me and which is something
very fantastic I should say.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.000
It has something.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.100
For example: discovering this, you may think
'what is it discovering this?'

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.990
'What was the use of the Kundalini has nothing
to do it?'

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:57.960
But today only on the radio I could give Realization
to many people.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.520
On the television you can give Realization
to people.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.980
So this is also useful.

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:08.130
Everything is achieved for Self-Realization.

01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:15.260
Science has achieved everything for Self-Realization.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:24.790
It is at the service of God and whatever is
not is all destructive.

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:35.530
Even I would say atom bomb is important otherwise
people would never have thought of God.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:57.680
Seeker: Yes; On to religion, Catholics why
is it that they make such a do of the Pope?

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680
He's only flesh and blood.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680
Mother: What do they do?

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.770
Sahaja Yogi: Why do Christians and Catholicism
particularly make such a thing of the Pope?

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:02.130
He's only flesh and blood.

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:09.360
Mother: You better go and ask them.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:17.580
About this Pope John, I went with My Husband
to Cranko and being a VIP or something, they

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.310
asked Me, "What would You like to see?"

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:23.110
I said, "I would like to see some good Church."

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:30.160
So they took Me to Cranko where this fellow
was the Cardinal and they held some sort of

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.160
a mass.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.730
I was sitting there and then I shook hands
with him and had tea with him and I rose his

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:37.730
Kundalini.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:44.070
It came and went back in the same shot.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:50.150
But sometimes when he is talking sense, the
Kundalini is up there; you see it come up

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:51.150
and goes down.

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:57.020
Still he's not established himself; the same
fellow who became the Pope.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:08.920
But why they make out of it is this because
Mr. Paul who is in the Bible.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.900
I don't know why he's there; has done all
this.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:19.160
Now first you must ask Me a question 'Why
Mother Mr. Paul is there in the Bible?'

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.980
Can you explain to Me that?

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:26.580
He never saw Christ; he had nothing to do
with Christ.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:31.360
Now I am asking you a simple question you
see, from God's side.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:37.920
Somebody must ask from God's side also sometimes
some questions.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:44.820
All right now this gentleman was just torturing
Christians, he becomes epileptic, he sees

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.670
some cross as he says.

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:49.840
Whatever it is, sees something so what?

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.490
And then he is in the Bible.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.320
How come?

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.260
Now he is not a free soul.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:08.110
If you accept Paul, this I had said long time
back, you will have to give up Christ and

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:12.930
that's what is happening today.

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:20.890
All right and even Protestants because I took
My birth in Protestants, among Protestants.

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:23.340
I know them.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:28.920
I know about all of them - Christians and
Hindus and Muslims and every one, are all

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920
funny fanatics.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.890
But the Protestants are very sophisticated
fanatics.

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:38.980
It's impossible to talk to them, specially
in India.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.330
Oh baba!

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:46.990
They are so sophisticated, they've done all
the science of the Bible.

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:51.140
They've made science out of Bible.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.580
Bible is so great how can you put it in the
science?

01:05:54.580 --> 01:06:00.390
Science is a wee part of it.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.860
You agree there with Me?

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:08.700
So now first let us accept we are first and
foremost human beings and we have to become

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.870
super human beings as realized souls.

01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:15.020
Whether you are Christian, Catholics, Hindus,
Muslims anything.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:22.890
It should be such, how can it be different?

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:27.040
Does God know that you went to a Anglican
Church or to another Church?

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.660
Does he, will he know?

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.250
Accha tell Me, do you think he will know all
these things?

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.250
Do you think?

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.600
Somebody must be keeping a record.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.780
Do you think so?

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:41.300
I mean is it not ridiculous the way we fight
about these things.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:47.820
Can He keep record of all these things?

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:52.150
And it's not only about Christians, it's same
in Hindus.

01:06:52.150 --> 01:07:00.970
Hindus are very fanatic, Sikhs are fanatics,
Muslims are fanatics; all blind people are

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:01.970
there.

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:02.970
But they are good people you know?

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.060
They believe in it.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:09.570
They are innocent; they believe that what
they believe into is the truth.

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:17.190
They have to just know that the truth is universal
and is for everyone.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:19.460
You cannot claim anyone as your own.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:22.050
Actually by that you've killed the truth.

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:27.820
Like a tree has many flowers, living flowers
you pluck some of them saying this; this is

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:36.310
mine, this is mine and the flower dies and
that ugly flower becomes your fanatic religion.

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:40.170
It's not a living flower.

01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:45.730
In Sahaja Yoga we know that all Prophets were
right.

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:48.970
What They said were right; we believe in Them.

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:57.100
We use Them on these different centers and
all the incarnations we use, but as far as

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:03.770
the outside religions are concerned we think
they need some cleansing and light.

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:12.080
Then everything will be all right.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.080
You are Catholic?

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.250
I mean you educated, I am sorry now you are
no.

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:24.320
But whether the education was in Catholic
Church?

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.840
If you want to hear about Christians, go and
ask Muslims.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.090
If you want to hear about Muslims, go and
ask Hindus.

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:33.920
If you want to hear about Hindus, go and ask
Buddhist.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.740
You'll get the full picture about them.

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:43.140
You see we can see what others are we don't
see what we are.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.290
True.

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:50.020
Sahaja Yogi: Any other question?

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:58.380
Mother's going to give you the experience
tonight, so why don't we do it now?

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.910
Just lift your shoes off so that your feet...

01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:09.520
Mother: You better take out your shoes.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:19.720
That's all I make humble request, that's all.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:33.800
I hope it's not difficult to take them out.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:40.110
I'll stand up I think.

01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:46.270
Paul, can you help Me please?

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:52.430
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to stand....

01:09:52.430 --> 01:10:03.740
Mother: There are lots of saints behind sitting
there and you all have to become saints.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:12.231
For that just you have to put your hands on
your lap as they do for Namaz like that because

01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:20.090
these fingers as you will see there are indicative
of your sympathetic nervous systems, left

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:24.030
and right and they form centers.

01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:30.170
So just put your hands like this.

01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:38.890
Now this hand represents the power of desire
as you will see on the left hand side and

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:42.440
this hand represents the power of action.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:59.290
Now what we have to do is to release our own
centers by giving help to them and the Kundalini

01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:06.070
will then rise immediately because if the
centers are augmented or constricted then

01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:08.670
Kundalini has to fight it.

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:16.990
To make things easier for Her, we'll have
to put our hand, right hand on different centers,

01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:20.310
which I'll tell you, which is very simple.

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.350
You don't have to do much about it.

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:31.910
So now the right hand that is the power of
action we'll be using for touching different

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:39.780
parts like the heart, the stomach, the lower
part of the stomach, then here at the base

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.990
of the neck like this and then here on the
forehead.

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:51.360
Ultimately on top of our head where the bone
was soft, the fontanel bone area.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.440
That's all.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.340
It's very simple one by one I will tell you.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:03.640
Another thing very important is that you should
not open your eyes till I tell you because

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:06.170
the happening has to take place within.

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:09.250
Your attention should be inside and not outside.

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:10.730
It will be sucked in.

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:15.130
You don't have to do, don't fight with it,
don't fight with your thoughts, don't fight

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.130
with anything.

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:19.060
Just let it loose it will work out.

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:26.360
You have to sit comfortably in a straight
manner without being lousy or without being

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360
over alert.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.290
Just sit in a very comfortable manner with
your left hand towards Me and the right hand

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:33.290
on the heart.

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:39.610
You may take out your spectacles or anything
because you have to keep your eyes shut all

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:40.610
the time.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:41.610
It helps also the eye sight.

01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:43.020
Now put the left hand on your heart.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.580
Sahaja Yogi: Right hand

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:59.200
Mother: I am sorry put your right hand on
the heart and left hand towards Me.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:06.230
At the very outset I have to tell you one
thing that you should not feel guilty about

01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:13.090
anything because that's one of the biggest
hurdles in the West.

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:18.150
So before saying anything you have to tell
yourself that 'I am not guilty, I am not guilty,

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.150
I am not guilty'.

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:20.150
Close your eyes and say that.

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:35.950
You are not to put your neck very much backwards
or forward or in any abnormal way, but sit

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:37.270
comfortably.

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:46.790
Now, on the heart you have to put your right
hand and all the time keep the left hand towards

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:48.170
Me.

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:57.330
At this stage you have to ask Me a question
because I said you are a computer and this

01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:58.330
is a very absolute question.

01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:05.850
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji whatever
suits you.

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:10.110
'Mother, am I the Spirit?'

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:31.090
Ask this question, three times.

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:37.440
Please don't open your eyes, keep the left
hand towards Myself and put your right hand

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.710
on your stomach in the upper-part; in the
upper-part of the abdomen on the left hand

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:44.710
side.

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:48.920
We have to just look after the left hand side
of our centers.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:58.790
So put the right hand on the left hand side
of the upper part of your stomach.

01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:07.750
Here lies the center of mastery; the Guru,
the Prophets.

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:19.370
So here you have to say, because you have
already asked a question that 'Mother, am

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:21.300
I the Spirit?'

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:24.910
You have to ask now another question relevantly
with it.

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:27.220
'Mother, am I my own Guru?'

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:38.880
Because if you are the master, if you are
the Spirit, automatically you become the master.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.580
Unless and until you are the Spirit you do
not become the master.

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:47.340
So the second question should be 'Mother am
I my own master?

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.820
Am I my own Guru?

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:58.450
Mother, am I the Prophet?'

01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:09.310
Three times please.

01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:30.410
Now, now we start with the real asking by
putting our right hand in the lower part of

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:33.680
our abdomen in the left hand side.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:45.610
The right hand on the lower part of our abdomen,
stomach, on the left hand side and press it

01:16:45.610 --> 01:16:47.830
a little bit.

01:16:47.830 --> 01:17:00.270
Here now is the beginning of asking for the
true knowledge, for the true technique, for

01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:02.380
the pure knowledge.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:08.910
So please ask Me six times because this center
is very important and has six petals, six

01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:11.430
sub plexuses it controls.

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:20.850
Please ask six times because I cannot force
you to do it unless and until you ask for

01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:22.550
it because you are free.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:31.140
To respect your freedom I have tell you that
you have to ask 'Mother may I have the true

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:36.380
knowledge, the pure knowledge of the Spirit?'

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:40.430
six times.

01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:56.980
Now you must be confident about it, you should
not be diffident, you should ask with full

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.880
confidence.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:08.610
Now, six times.

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:18.100
Please don't feel guilty and be confident.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:29.010
Now we have to raise it so we go back to the
same position on the left side of our stomach

01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:30.830
in the upper part.

01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:39.080
Please put your right hand on the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:45.920
Now here you have to assert with full confidence.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.400
Ten times you have to say because there are
ten valences we have, we have Ten Commandments

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.040
and ten times the Primordial Master incarnated
on this Earth.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:09.930
So we have to say ten times in full confidence
'Mother I am my own master.

01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:13.860
Mother I am my own Guru.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:27.640
Mother I am the Prophet'.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:46.710
Now please say it ten times.

01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:53.260
Don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty.

01:19:53.260 --> 01:20:02.890
[Mother blows Cool Breeze twice.]

01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:16.660
Now ten times; raise your right hand after
saying ten times, to your heart.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:28.330
Again here there are twelve sub plexuses,
so you have to assert with full confidence

01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:38.270
by saying 'Mother I am the Spirit', which
is the truth.

01:20:38.270 --> 01:21:04.420
Without feeling guilty you must say that because
God is the ocean of love, he is the ocean

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:06.730
of compassion.

01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:13.560
He is the ocean of forgiveness and what kind
of guilt you can have?

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:19.010
What kind of sin you can commit that He cannot
forgive?

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:30.490
So don't try to count your sins and count
your mistakes and count your guilt just say,

01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:34.920
'Mother I am the Spirit'.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:22:04.170
Now saying this about twelve times you raise
your right hand at the base of the neck and

01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:07.940
press it hard on the shoulder.

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:13.590
This center is always caught up.

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:23.359
So again I have to say that for sixteen times
you have to say, 'Mother I am not guilty'

01:22:23.359 --> 01:22:29.470
and if you have the habit of feeling guilty
too much better say it hundred and eight times

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:31.439
to punish your self.

01:22:31.439 --> 01:22:36.580
I am assuring you that you are not guilty
but if you want to say that again and again

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.810
all right go ahead with it for hundred and
eight times.

01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:42.210
Don't feel guilty otherwise you'll miss the
point.

01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:51.510
[ Shri Mataji guides someone in the audience]
From the front hold it from the front not

01:22:51.510 --> 01:23:01.769
from the back, 'saamne se hath lijiye, aise
pichese nahin, saamne se haath lijiye', tell

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:02.769
him.

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:12.480
That gentleman also, that one.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.959
Haan!

01:23:14.959 --> 01:23:33.820
Better from the front, much better.

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:38.229
Sixteen times; believe in yourself.

01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:40.750
Have faith in yourself, forgive yourself.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.959
First of all you forgive yourself.

01:23:42.959 --> 01:24:02.630
Or at the most you can say that 'O Lord forgive
me', but don't feel guilty while saying that.

01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:13.497
[Mother to Sahaja Yogi: You shouldn't disturb,
I know what to do.

01:24:13.497 --> 01:24:14.497
I don't want to listen to you.]

01:24:14.497 --> 01:24:25.990
Now... you have to raise your hand up to your
forehead

01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:36.410
and here you have to say in a very simple
words, 'Mother I forgive everything, I forgive

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:41.830
everyone' with full heart in it.

01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:46.860
Now some people told Me it's very difficult
and this and that but actually when you don't

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.840
forgive, what do you do?

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.510
Or when you forgive what do you do?

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:55.740
Nothing, it's all mythical.

01:24:55.740 --> 01:25:03.810
On the contrary you are torturing yourself
by not forgiving.

01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:27.860
So please say from your heart, 'Mother I forgive
everyone'; on your forehead.

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:48.020
Now, now raise your hand on top of your head,
put it on the fontanel bone area, your palm

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:53.920
and press it and move it clockwise, your scalp.

01:25:53.920 --> 01:26:05.169
At this point you have to say, 'Mother please
give me my Realization' because I cannot cross

01:26:05.169 --> 01:26:07.200
your freedom again.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.530
This you have to say seven times.

01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:16.960
But before doing that please say that, 'If
I have done anything wrong, O Lord please

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.740
forgive me'.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:28.850
Without feeling guilty again; three times.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:40.560
Now seven times you say, 'Mother please give
me my Self-Realization' because I cannot cross.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:27:01.020
[Mother blows the Cool Breeze twice...]

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:14.660
[What heat baap re...]

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.900
Now take down that hand.

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.800
[Mother blows Cool Breeze twice.]

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:32.970
Now put the left hand on top of your head
about four inches above and see for yourself

01:27:32.970 --> 01:27:34.370
if there's a Cool Breeze coming in.

01:27:34.370 --> 01:28:18.180
[Mother blows Cool Breeze seven times]

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:25.330
Now change your hands and see for yourself
if there's a Cool Breeze coming in.

01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:40.490
Right side is clear, good.

01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:51.870
Now left side.

01:28:51.870 --> 01:29:08.380
Again change your hands and see if there is
a Cool Breeze coming.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:13.440
Ah! better.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:36.140
Mother to Sahaja Yogi: You have to ask the
master question, Holy Ghost; later not just

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:37.140
now.

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:42.260
Mother: Now those who are not feeling the
Cool Breeze raise your hands please.

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:46.160
Please raise them high so that they could
see.

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.570
Now the Sahaja Yogis will come and attend
to you.

01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:50.850
Now don't get upset with them.

01:29:50.850 --> 01:30:12.250
If you are not feeling the Cool Breeze raise
your hands and if you are feeling it you got

01:30:12.250 --> 01:30:13.250
it.

01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:14.250
She's got it, Vishuddhi, it is, she feels
guilty.

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:15.910
You felt it?

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:22.600
Have you felt it?

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.350
Not yet?

01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:32.110
All right; Aapko nahin hua?

01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:35.220
Aarahe hai.

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.110
Some have felt, some have not felt doesn't
matter.

01:30:38.110 --> 01:30:41.430
Sahaja Yogi: Just describe again what they
should feel

01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:51.100
Mother: You should feel a Cool Breeze coming
out of your head like a cooler.

01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:54.210
There might be hot coming in doesn't matter.

01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:56.380
You got it?

01:30:56.380 --> 01:31:03.360
Sahaja Yogi: ...He's got a Cool Breeze coming
from his hand into his head.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.360
Mother: Correct!

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:10.570
Now just see if it is coming from your head
or not.

01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:12.780
Just check.

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:20.200
Tell him to say that 'Mother come in my head'.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.290
This lady, Derrick you go, just come and see.

01:31:23.290 --> 01:31:24.290
It's better now, see.

01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:26.410
You may ask 'Is this the Cool Breeze of the
Holy Ghost?'

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:28.430
What about this lady?

01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:32.330
Ya, no somebody should attend to her and this
one.

01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:34.280
Is there some another way someone should come
and attend to this lady?

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.280
'Aaapka nahin hua?

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.280
Ho gaye?

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.280
Aaraha hai?

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.280
Ho gaye paar?

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.280
Paar utara gaye sant jana re.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.280
Haan'

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.280
From the audience: There's slight tingling
on this palm.

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.280
Mother: In the left hand?

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:48.140
Ask him to ask the question of Holy Ghost.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.740
On the left hand if they have tingling you
can very easily do that.

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:54.190
Sahaja Yogi: Anyone who's getting the tingling
or not getting the vibrations on the left

01:31:54.190 --> 01:31:55.190
hand...

01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:56.950
Mother: No, no let them tell them privately;
don't make it open

01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:57.950
Sahaja Yogi:...just put your left hand to
Mother.

01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:58.950
Mother: Ask the question

01:31:58.950 --> 01:32:00.180
Sahaja Yogi: Give me the Cool Breeze of the
Holy Ghost.

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.520
Mother: No, 'Are You the, Mother are You the
Holy Ghost?'

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:11.680
I am asking to ask 'Mother are You the Holy
Ghost?'

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:19.060
Aa raha hai (it's coming?) left hand towards
Me.

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:23.310
Left hand towards Me.

01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:35.580
From the audience: 'Mother, are You the Holy
Ghost?

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:36.750
Are You the Holy Spirit?

01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:37.750
Mother: All right the tingling has gone, the
answer has come, now recognize.

01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:38.750
May God bless you.

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:39.750
Now this gentleman, what about the one who
was worried about the Pope?

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:40.750
Did he feel the Cool Breeze?

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:41.750
This lady she's got it.

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:42.750
What about you?

01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:43.750
Lady from the seekers: ...tingle

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:44.750
Mother: tingle on both the hands?

01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:45.750
Lady: ..On both the hands

01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:46.750
Mother: She has both the hands give her a
bandhan.

01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:47.750
Haan ab bas shanti dharo, chit mein hi shanti.

01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:48.750
This gentleman - Maria?

01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:49.750
You have not forgiven; keep your eyes open
and watch Me and say 'Mother I forgive'.

01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:50.750
Seeker: Mother I forgive everyone.

01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:51.750
Mother I forgive everyone.

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:52.750
Sahaja Yogi: Getting less tingle?

01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:53.750
Just say it again ..., while looking at Mother.

01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:54.750
Mother: Ho gaya jagaran?

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:55.750
Have got it.

01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:56.750
You got it sir?

01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:57.750
Inke bhi ho gaya (he also got it).

01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:58.750
Aap unke sar pe dekhiye aura (you see on top
of his head, aura).

01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:59.750
Haan has he got it?

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:00.750
Tingling left?

01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:01.750
Ask him to ask the question of the Holy Ghost,
you ask.

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:02.750
Just enjoy don't think about it; just enjoy
yourself, you got it.

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:03.750
Now you have to establish yourself that's
the most important part and in Leicester we

01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:04.750
have a very powerful Sahaja Yogi, .. has spoken
to you.

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:05.750
Sahaja Yogi: Just say 'Shri Mataji are You
the Holy Ghost?

01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:06.750
Shri Mataji are You the Holy Ghost?'

01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:07.750
Mother: Holy Ghost mane [means] Adi Shakti.

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:08.750
Haan

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:09.750
Sahaja Yogi: You are feeling it on your left
hand?

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:10.750
Mother: That's the answer.

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:11.750
What about this lady?

01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:12.750
She got it?

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:13.750
She's got it.

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:14.750
Sahaja Yogi: ...she is Sahaja Yogi

01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:15.750
What about her?

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:16.750
Haan what about this one, this gentleman with
spectacles?

01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:17.750
Is she all right...?

01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:18.750
Good.

01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:19.750
Dekhiye sab paar hogaye.

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:20.750
Tell him not to feel guilty.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:21.750
This gentleman here

01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:22.750
Sahaja Yogi: Yellow shirt

01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:23.750
Mother: Yellow shirt, please don't feel guilty.

01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:24.750
What about the gentleman behind.....he's all
right, he's got it, he's got it.

01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:25.750
John you better get their names, who belong
to Leicester.

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:26.750
Maria, Maria come.

01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:27.750
Gavin I saw I think?

01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:28.750
Sahaja Yogini: Yes he's here.

01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:29.750
Mother: He's here; all right, all right.

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:30.750
What do you say comes up and down?

01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:31.750
Tie it up, tie it up.

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:32.750
Gavin...

01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:33.750
Sahaja Yogi: ..he's the Indian gentleman

01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:34.750
Mother: Haan he's what?

01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:35.750
Ask him to pull his ears.

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:36.750
Sahaja Yogi: He's feeling it now, he pulled
his ears.

01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:37.750
Please work in silence.

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:38.750
Please work in silence.

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:39.750
Please work in silence.

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:40.750
Sahaja yogi: It's very important that you
should follow-up this experience.

01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:41.750
There is a center in Leicester and at that
center they can teach you very simple techniques

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:42.750
some of which you've seen being done now to
purify and remove these blockages in the charkas.

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:43.750
They'll teach you how to raise your Kundalini
how to establish it, how to develop your vibrations

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:44.750
and then ultimately how to cure yourself,
how to cure others and how to give others

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:45.750
self-realization.

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:46.750
It's so simple that you have to work it out
together.

01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:47.750
John is going to be here ultimately and meanwhile
they are going to have regular meetings so

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:48.750
that you can follow it up.

01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:49.750
John will tell you little more.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:50.750
[Mother: Agya; she has very bad Agya.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:51.750
Ask her to forgive everyone.]

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:52.750
John: We'll be holding meetings every Thursday
evening at his place; probably in the other

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:53.750
room but in this building, 7.30 Thursday evenings.

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:54.750
If you come along we can help you to maintain
this experience and also to deepen it because

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:55.750
what's happened this evening is like a seed
as I say it's not become a old tree yet.

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:56.750
It's still a seed so by nurturing it, protecting
it, watering it so on.

01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:57.750
It will enable it to grow and that's what
you can do at these meetings.

01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:58.750
Very soon you can learn as much as the Sahaja
Yogis here have learnt, maybe even more hopefully

01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:59.750
by Shri Mataji's blessings.

01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:00.750
There's an address list that we are taking
if you'd like to leave us your name and address

01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:01.750
we can then get in touch and you know in any
other big meetings we can send you a post

01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:02.750
card reminding you where our regular meetings
are and we'll also put in the address of the

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:03.750
center, the Sahaja Yoga center and then if
you have any problems any [stage?] or anything

01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:04.750
like that you can contact us and we can tell
you what to do and so on.

01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:05.750
Thank you very much

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:06.750
[Mother: So I am very thankful for all this...What
was the name of the gentleman on the TV?

01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:07.750
Sahaja yogi: The interviewer?

01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:08.750
Mother: No the other person.

01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:09.750
He's the main person...

01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:10.750
Sahaja yogi: He's the editor, the film editor.]

01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:11.750
Mother: Now I have to tell you one thing,
you should not discuss about your realization

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:12.750
too much.

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:13.750
Please Sahaja Yogis also should know.

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:14.750
You see you are all Sahaja Yogis and you have
achieved it, but they are still just, they

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:15.750
have just gone into it.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.750
So try to understand, they are not like you
that whatever is the situation you keep there.

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:17.750
They, you have attained it, they have to attain
still.

01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:18.750
So keep quiet and another thing is please
don't think about it don't talk about it too

01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:19.750
much.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:20.750
Work it out.

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:21.750
Its not that by talking is will work out on
the contrary the more you'll think about it

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:22.750
the worse it will be.

01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:23.750
It's like a small little plant, a little shoot.

01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:24.750
We have to be now careful with it, respect
it and gradually when you'll be coming to

01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:25.750
those meetings you'll develop it.

01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:26.750
While the Sahaja Yogis who are here, all are
experts and whatever may happen even there's

01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.751
earthquake...
