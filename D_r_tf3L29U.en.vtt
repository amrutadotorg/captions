00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Based on and inspired by the teachings
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, this series

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.574
aims to explore the evolutionary relationship
between two interconnected domains

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.844
expressing human awareness
at the gross and subtle levels.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.115
It endeavors to elucidate this complex interplay
between the current scientific understanding

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.919
of human neuroanatomy; the autonomic
nervous system in particular,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.923
and the so-called subtle system as described
in the traditional literature on yoga.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.961
Ultimately, the series tries to bring its viewers
along this exploratory journey

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.500
to experience these relationships through meditation
as taught by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.080
Welcome, all of you, to yet
another exciting episode

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.080
in our series of this conversation
with Dr. Ashish Pradhan.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.640
Dr. Pradhan is a distinguished
medical leader,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.680
and we have been talking to him
about neuroscience, spirituality,
and meditation.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.960
We have talked about the nervous system,
including the brain,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.000
and today we welcome him to talk
to him about the second

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.920
and the third energy centers.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.920
Welcome, Dr. Ashish.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.560
Thank you.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.400
It's nice to be back, Monikaji.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.560
Definitely.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.720
So, without any delay, let's take
the first question that we have for you.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.280
We would like to know
any relationship that exists

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.000
between the autonomic nervous system and
the second and the third energy centers.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.040
Thank you, Monikaji.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.360
So, the second energy center
is referred to as

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.760
the Swadhisthan Chakra.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.240
The second energy center
governs the functioning

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.640
of the aortic plexus, which is the
corresponding plexus within

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.480
the autonomic nervous system.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.480
As we had said in the first episode,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.680
it's the pelvic plexus that corresponds
to the first energy center,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200
the Muladhara Chakra.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.360
Likewise, the second energy center,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.040
the so-called Swadhisthan Chakra

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.480
governs the activity
of the aortic plexus.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.800
The aortic plexus is present
in front of the lower part of the aorta,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.000
and through its branches,
it governs the functioning

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.480
of the pelvic viscera
or the pelvic organs,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.840
which comprise, for example,
the rectum, the urinary bladder

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.600
in both males and females,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.040
and in the female body,
also looks after

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.480
the functioning of the reproductive organs,
such as the uterus, the fallopian tubes.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.560
As we had also said
during the first episode,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.480
that the autonomic nervous system,
comprising two components,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.600
the parasympathetic and the sympathetic,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.520
it's like this: the origin is in the brain,
it's like an inverted tree.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.240
We had spoken about that,
with roots in the brain

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.880
and the branches
come downwards.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.280
So, the parasympathetic and the sympathetic
work very close to each other.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.280
They are the two main components of it,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.520
and one thing that we should remember,
even as we look at these chakras,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.240
the first energy center,
which we dealt with before,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.160
the second and the third energy centers
which we are going to talk about today,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.560
and the energy centers above that,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.000
they all function as one unit.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.240
It's a holistic unit.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.440
If we start adopting a kind of a
Cartesian frame of approach,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.160
then the audience would be misinformed,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.680
and it's something that I would like
to share with the audience:

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.320
that we should look upon
our entire system,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.960
all these seven
energy centers or chakras,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.920
as well as the nervous system,
because the nervous system

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.160
functions as one unit.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.000
It is not discrete.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.640
It has component parts to it,
but it still functions in harmony

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.600
in its governance.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.320
So, that is the second energy center
and the corresponding plexus,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.720
which is the aortic plexus.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.520
Dr. Pradhan, it seems that
the Void may not be an energy center,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.480
as is depicted in the
human subtle system,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.520
but do tell us about that
and about the correlation

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.560
that it may have with
the nervous system.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.400
Before we go to the
third energy center,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.360
which is the Nabhi or
the Manipura chakra,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.320
and the corresponding plexus,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.720
the Void is probably one of the most
intriguing and interesting aspects

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.880
of the entire subtle system
and also how it corresponds

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.720
to neuroanatomy.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.520
Now, there is a lot of research
that has happened,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.560
particularly in the past century,
more so in the past 30-40 years,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.600
that seems to suggest that
the autonomic nervous system

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.400
comprises not two,
but three components.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.600
You have the parasympathetic component,
as is represented by the vagus nerve

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.960
for the most part.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.560
You have the sympathetic component,
which is the two chains

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.040
of sympathetic ganglia 
that run close

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.440
to the vertebral column outside of it.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.000
And then there is, hold your breath,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.600
it's called the enteric nervous system,
the ENS.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.080
And the ENS is now thought to be
a third, very important,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.480
completely independent
component of the autonomic nervous system.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.240
And the reason for this is that
it has its own governing system

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.400
that is not controlled
directly from the brain.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.920
There are innervations,
there is a crosstalk,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.320
but the way it functions is that
you have these nerves

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.560
that are present
throughout the gut.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.960
Gut starts from
the esophagus

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.000
right up to the rectum
and the anal canal.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.040
The entire gut, but within
the abdominal cavity, you could say,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.000
you have this nervous system
which has its innervations,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.200
which has its connections
within the walls of the entire gut.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.960
And through neurotransmitters,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.480
through nerve impulses,
through these kinds of neurohormones,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.920
it controls in a relatively
independent fashion

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.880
the functioning of the entire gut.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.880
So, what does that mean?

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.720
When we eat something,
you chew, you masticate,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.880
and then you swallow.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.400
When you swallow, that begins the process,
or what enables swallowing,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.960
as we call it, is peristalsis.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.560
Peristalsis is this movement
of the gut that allows food

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.000
to propel from point A to point B,
to point C, point D, all the way down,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.280
and that is how the nutrients
are absorbed from what we eat

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.720
in our food, or whatever we drink,
is absorbed.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.760
So, that is possible
because of peristalsis.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:44.880
Peristalsis is possible,
this movement of the muscles of the gut,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.200
is possible because, again,
we had spoken the last time around,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.520
of electrical impulses that are created
within the nervous system.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.360
That's what the nervous system is;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.960
it's an electrical system.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.800
So, these impulses that are created
within the gut

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.880
are a function of the
enteric nervous system.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.080
So, this ENS, or the enteric
nervous system,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.040
is now considered to be
an independent unit.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.280
If we look at the subtle system,
now, this comes to the relationship

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.040
with the autonomous nervous system,
to answer your question.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.800
If you look at a graph
of the subtle system

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.760
that we have in our body,
you notice that it starts from here,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.000
or rather, it starts
from the bottom,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.040
and it stops at the
second energy center,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.680
and then from the second energy center
to the fourth energy center,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.360
it's like you can see a dot, dot, dot,
dotted kind of a line.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.560
And that, from a spiritual point of view,
is considered a Void.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.880
Void is nothingness,
that there is nothing there.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.120
And that is extraordinarily interesting
because the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.400
it gets a little technical, but it is
of immense consequence

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.120
and great interest.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.760
So, the parasympathetic nervous system
consists of two sources of outflows,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.640
as we call it.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.320
Where it come out from:

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.880
One is the cranium, from where we have
the middle part of the brain,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.800
the midbrain, from where
the nerves come out.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.480
From where also, one of the cranial nerves
is the vagus nerve,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.240
which comprises the major part
of the parasympathetic nervous system

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.480
that innervates all the organs.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.840
And then you have the sacral outflow.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.640
So, you have the cranio-sacral outflow.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.600
So, there are two sources of outflows,
but there is nothing in between.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.360
And that, to me at least,
is very interesting

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.200
from a correlation point of view
of that gap

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.920
in the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.760
That there is the cranial outflow
and there is the sacral outflow,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.120
but there is nothing in between.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.880
It doesn't mean there are no nerves.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.600
There are nerves.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.080
The vagus does innervate it.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.560
But that gap, to me,
corresponds to the Void.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.040
So, the Void is not that
there is nothing there.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.520
The Void is a way
of communicating

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.680
that there is this gap
in the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.440
and that gap needs to be
bridged, if you will.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.320
So, once again, in the subtle system,
there is a dot, dot, dot,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.240
it's kind of a dotted line
from the second

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.800
to the fourth energy center,
with the third energy center

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.000
coming in between.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.440
And that corresponds
to the spiritual anatomy,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.920
and, maybe, the neuroanatomy
of the nervous system.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.040
That said, back to the
enteric nervous system.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.320
The enteric nervous system
contains as many neurons -

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.600
hold your breath -

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.640
as many neurons as there are
neurons in the spinal cord.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.520
So, you literally have billions
of neurons in the gut.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.120
And that's why the gut,
the enteric nervous system,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.760
is now referred to as
the second brain.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.960
We have the brain, and now this is
considered increasingly as the second brain,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.080
which is why gut health,
the microbiome, the microbiota,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.040
there's trillions of bacteria
that live in our gut

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.800
that have been in existence with us
since we started

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:41.040
our evolutionary journey. All of this
controls our mood, our emotions,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.640
how we feel.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.480
We eat good food, we feel good.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.080
If we are dyspeptic, if we are feeling
something, nauseated,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.840
that also impacts our mood.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.160
So, increasingly, there is an understanding
that the enteric nervous system,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.320
or the region that
corresponds to the Void,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.840
has an effect on our brain.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.720
It controls our mood,
it controls our emotion,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.080
it manages our immune system as well.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.600
A lot of, for example,
inflammatory bowel disease

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.800
or those kinds of diseases
are now known to have

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.440
that psychosomatic relationship,
that inflammatory component.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.400
So, there is a very sophisticated
immune system

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.320
that exists within the gut as well.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:32.080
So, all of this comes together to form
what may be called the Void,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.640
or is called, from the spiritual
point of view, the Void,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.080
but it is anything but empty,
and it has a very important role to play

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.240
in our spiritual journey.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.920
So, the third energy center,
which is called the Manipura chakra

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.680
or the Nabhi chakra,
governs, from a Sahaj point of view,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:58.320
the action of a very well-known plexus
called the solar plexus.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.120
The solar plexus, in anatomy,
is actually called the celiac plexus,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.960
and it is situated here,
between the umbilicus

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.760
and the lower part of the sternum,
but at the back of the body,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:18.080
just behind the structures
that lie there,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.280
and it is called the solar plexus
because, if you look at it,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.600
it looks like a sun
with kind of nerves

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.440
radiating from it,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.640
and the celiac plexus,
has a number of sub-plexuses,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.440
and those plexuses control
the functioning of the organs

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.560
that are, quote-unquote, very, 
very, very important or very critical.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.360
Everything is important,
but even more so,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.960
the liver, the pancreas, the spleen.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.480
The hepatic plexus has innervations,
which is the sub-plexus

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.760
of the celiac plexus.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.640
It looks after the functioning of the liver
or is involved with that functioning.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.160
Similarly, the pancreatic plexus
and the spleen plexus,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.000
and the upper part of the gut,
which is the stomach, the duodenum,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.680
the jejunum, and so on and so forth.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:16.160
So, again, as I said before,
the second energy center,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.560
and the third energy center,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.000
which is the Swadhisthana 
and the Nabhi and the Void.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.840
These three together, which is why
we are covering them today

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.440
in this episode,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.440
look after the functioning
of the entire organ systems,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.480
including the reproductive system,
the excretory system,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.400
the kidneys, for example.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.640
They are all governed
between these two energy centers,

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.640
through their innervations.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.160
This might be a great opportunity also
to understand in a very brief,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.360
like a few, couple of minutes, literally.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.360
A couple of organs in the body
that are also important

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.480
from a spiritual point of view,
in a different way.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.400
It's somewhat absurd to say
that only some organs are more important

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.080
than others. That's not the point.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.840
What we are trying to say
is a little different.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.720
So, let's take the case
of the liver, for example.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.920
Now, the liver is considered
a vital organ in the body,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.080
much like the heart, the brain,
and the kidneys.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.080
The liver is critical; it has
a number of functions,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.800
but one of the most important functions,
along with the fact that it produces bile

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.160
and it helps
in the digestion of fat.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.600
It stores the other form of glucose,
that is, glycogen.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.960
It has that, but the liver
also detoxifies.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.000
It has a very important function
in the sense that whatever food we eat,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.080
the nutrients that are absorbed
from the gut first pass

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.200
through the liver.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.160
It's called the hepatic portal system,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.600
and it is where a lot of toxins
are destroyed.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.280
So, the liver is like
your detoxification center,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.120
apart from its
other aspects.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.440
As the founder of this
system of meditation,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:20.480
Shri Mataji has said that the Void
is reflective of the ocean,

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.240
and why that is so,
and of the principle of the master.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.800
And the reason why that is so
is that the ocean is something

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:35.440
that takes in all of our toxins
and purifies them,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.840
and it is sent back to us
in the form of clouds

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.000
and then rain, and so on and so forth.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.200
Of course, we are polluting our oceans

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.480
to a point, maybe, where humanity
is going to face

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.400
an even bigger issue, but that's
outside of the purview of this discussion.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.520
But the liver is very interesting.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:01.760
Is kind of symbolic
of that ocean within us

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.200
that takes in the toxins,
purifies them,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.680
and, therefore, nourishes the body.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.040
So, that's the liver.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.360
It has a very important place
in meditative practice.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.840
It is also considered
the seat of attention.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.280
So, it's very interesting: 
in people with attention deficit

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.160
hyperactivity disorders, ADHDs,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.560
if you see their vibrations,

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.800
we see that they have an issue
with the third energy center,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.560
which, again, is very indicative
of this issue

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.040
and is very interesting as well.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.640
The second thing I wanted to mention today
was also about the pancreas.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.000
The pancreas, as everybody knows,
sits across

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.840
on the left to right side, 
and it covers the center,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.320
and it produces insulin and glucagon,
two hormones that are very, very important.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.840
Insulin, everybody knows about
because diabetes is practically part

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.400
of the lexicon that we use,
and insulin's main function is:

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:07.520
when you take sugar in, it converts,
it drives the uptake of that glucose,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.240
of that sugar into cells, 
because if that doesn't happen,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.760
that sugar is converted into fat,
into triglycerides,

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.600
which is the main problem these days
why we have obesity,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.720
and also leads to
insulin resistance

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.680
and then type 2 diabetes.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.240
So, the reason why this is important
from the Sahaj point of view,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.480
from the subtle system point of view,
is that the brain only uses glucose

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.400
as its source of energy.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.680
The muscles can use glucose;
they can use fat as their source of energy,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.800
but the brain, the cells in the brain,
can only use glucose,

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.800
and that's why,
when we eat something,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.640
the sugar helps to keep
the brain going,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.480
and, as you know, when we feel low,
if we eat something, we feel better.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.280
That's because the sugar levels go up,
and that is important

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.440
from a spiritual point of view as well.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.320
Why?

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.360
Because if we think too much,
if we work too much,

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.680
if we plan too much,
it starts placing stresses

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.800
on these two organ systems,
particularly the pancreas,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.240
and that's where the relationship
between the second, the third energy center,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.920
and the Void, or the enteric system,
all come together.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.760
So, these are very interesting
correlations between the spiritual system,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.000
the gross anatomical system,
and the functioning

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.760
of the human body.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.640
So, Dr. Pradhan, we'd also like
to understand the relationship

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.840
between these energy centers
and the nervous system

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.720
at a human evolutionary level.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.840
That's again a very fascinating,
very interesting question.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.600
As we referred to
just a little while ago,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:16.080
the enteric nervous system, the ENS,
is actually considered

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.200
a primordial nervous system.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.400
When bacteria, the most
primitive life forms,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.760
started evolving
in the primordial ocean,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.120
you might say, in water,
they were aquatic life forms,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.280
and from there, evolution started:
amphibians, and then terrestrials.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.160
But if you look at the most
primitive life forms,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.160
and some of the more advanced
amongst aquatic life forms,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.880
multicellular organisms, what you find is
that when there is a gut,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.080
any kind of a system of alimentation,
there is a nervous system.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:00.800
So, the enteric nervous system
actually predates the central nervous system,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.760
the organization of the
central nervous system,

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.680
that is central command
and control, if you will.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.640
So, the enteric nervous system
predates everything,

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.240
which means that, from an
evolutionary point of view,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.560
the physical nourishment of the organism
was very important,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.200
and that continues even today; for us,
if we don't eat, we suffer.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.280
But what has happened is that
these energy centers,

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:33.840
or these correlations between
the spirituality of it

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:43.440
and the evolutionary construct, is that
we used to just eat, reproduce, die;

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.560
eat, reproduce, die.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.720
Those were the cycles
through which simple, or even basic,

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:57.040
complex multicellular organisms
started. That was the lifestyle.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.000
As the central nervous system evolved,
there was a, quote-unquote,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.360
higher, quote-unquote, purpose
to the existence of the organisms,

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.720
not that they started writing
Shakespearean poetry,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.440
or they started painting
or composing music.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.120
That happened much, much later
with Homo sapiens,

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.880
but before that, there was 
a gradual progression.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.160
Maybe there is some rise 
of consciousness; we still don't know

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.800
what animal consciousness is.
We are thinking about it.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:34.560
But these energy centers are,
quote-unquote, allowing for

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.080
the mere existence of the organism,

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.240
and that is why, when we talk about
the spiritual mastery,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.640
that a seeker or a practitioner
of meditation aspires

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.880
to overcome those base
requirements,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.560
those base instincts,
which are important for survival,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.640
but not for a higher
evolutionary purpose,

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.680
and we'll talk about that as we talk
about the other centers above.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.640
So, what do we mean by that?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.800
Therefore, in a nutshell,
is food important? 
Yes, it's important.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:18.240
Should we be obsessed with food? No.
That spiritual evolution speaks to

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.360
not just satisfying your thirst
or your hunger,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.200
but to be detached from it,
to be able to rise above that.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.600
So, when this inner energy that we spoke
about in one of the first episodes,

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.600
when it starts rising above the second,
the third, and, particularly,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.200
the so-called Void area, it allows
the individual to achieve

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.440
a different plane of
evolutionary existence,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.280
where food is important,
nourishment is important,

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.360
but it is not the end-all
and be-all of existence,

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.800
which is why, when we read about
the great masters,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.760
we see that they are not conditioned,
they are not obsessed,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.400
they don't just think about food
all the time.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.640
From the time we get up, otherwise,
in the morning, we just think about breakfast,

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.680
then lunch, then snacks in between,
then dinner, and then...

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.880
This continuous planning about
what's the next best thing

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:26.960
I can put in my mouth.
That speaks to this very primordial,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:33.200
billions-of-years-old instinct
of consumption, of nutrition,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.680
whereas spirituality allows you
to rise above that.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.440
Consumption of food is important,
but cannot become an obsession,

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.560
and that's where there is this
beautiful correlation

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.160
that once we get into the
meditative practice of Sahaja,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.120
we get to understand that,
yes, food is important;

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.960
yes, consumption and
hydration are important;

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.960
eating healthy, nutritious food is critical,
that you don't do stupid things

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.760
to your body, but there is
a higher purpose,

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.960
and that higher purpose,
is this realization

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.000
of a higher state of awareness.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.120
These energy centers look after us,
help us to survive,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.680
because without survival,
then existence comes to an end.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.200
But that is not the goal of existence.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.280
The goal of existence is not to eat
gourmet food morning, noon, and night,

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.520
because that's an evolutionary
conditioning,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.040
and Sahaj practice
helps you to transcend that.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:41.760
The consciousness rises

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:47.200
from these drives, these primordial
drives that we have within us.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.200
Like we said, the enteric nervous system,
the drive for nutrition, has come to us

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.760
right from the stage when life forms
were in the bacterial stage,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.240
and that has still not disappeared;
it is, in fact, even more

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.400
ingrained within us.
And that's

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.160
the relationship between
spirituality, physiology,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.800
and the rise and 
the elevation of human consciousness,

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.800
once this inner energy rises above
the second, the third energy centers,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.040
and allows us that
mastery over the body.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.040
So, if you don't eat for a few hours,
it doesn't mean you collapse,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.880
other things notwithstanding.
If you don't get your favorite food,

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.360
it doesn't mean that
you are completely upset,

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.400
and it doesn't taste the exact way
your mom made it,

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.120
or whichever your
favorite restaurant makes it,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.520
and then you get upset about it.
Sahaj allows you to rise above that,

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.680
and that is the correlation
between the need for nutrition

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.640
versus the obsession with it,
and the ability to rise above.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.440
Very beautiful
way of explaining it.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.680
So, that brings us to the final question,
which relates more

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.372
to our day-to-day existence
and functioning.

00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:07.520
Now, what are some of the reasons
that can cause issues or problems

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.800
with this part of our subtle system?
And, maybe,

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.120
how do those problems manifest
at a gross level?

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.560
Is there a way to
make corrections?

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.080
So, we will go through this
with every kind of episode,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.520
but the thing to remember, again,
as we said at the very beginning, Monikaji,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.440
is that the whole system is holistic.
There isn't, that you just take care

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.120
of one center and then not worry
about the rest.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.680
You have to take care of
the entire system,

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.600
all the seven energy centers
and the energy channels.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.600
What causes problems, particularly
with second and third energy centers,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.280
are twofold: one, at the physical level;
others, at the emotional level.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.360
Again, from the so-called right side,
as we say, and the so-called

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.480
left side, as we say,
the right and the left components

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:58.640
of the sympathetic nervous system.
One way to get these two centers,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.560
particularly at a subtle level,
the Swadhisthana and the Manipura chakra,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.760
stressed out is, as we said,
you think too much, you plan too much,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.040
you work too much,
you get stressed out.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.680
You chase money for its own sake.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.520
Everybody needs money, but if you
start getting obsessed with it,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.480
with materialism, excess of it,
how much does a person really need?

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.520
It's not a philosophical question;
it's very much a practical question.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.680
And what are you doing to get to that?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.680
There's an honest, straightforward way
of earning your living,

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.440
and then there are nefarious ways
of doing it, and many people do that.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.640
So, at that subtle level, even if
you are earning money,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.840
it starts affecting
these energy centers.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.000
The other thing, as we said, is
if you think too much,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.200
that gives rise to another
very interesting thing:

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.320
the kidney produces a hormone
called renin.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.280
Renin gets converted into 
angiotensin I,
angiotensin II,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.320
and these modulate
your blood pressure.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.720
So, if you think too much,
if you work too much,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.960
it's possible that, through this,
the sympathetic nervous system

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.480
gets activated, more adrenaline
is secreted if you work hard,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.760
and then that also activates
the renin-angiotensin system,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.000
and that's how your 
blood pressure can go up.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.280
So, you see immediately
there is a relationship

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.600
between the second and the
third energy center,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.120
and the fourth energy center,
which controls your heart.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.680
So, as we said, 
the whole system is integrated.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.200
So, one of the ways to
keep these energy centers in balance

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.000
is to lead a balanced lifestyle.
It's not tautology;

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.240
it's to say, 'Okay,
am I satisfied?'

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.480
It speaks to that principle
of mastery within us.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.440
Am I happy? Am I content?
Am I making the lives of those around me

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.400
happy, or am I
making it miserable?

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.680
How much of a drive do I have?
And then, as we saw,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.720
the brain does use glucose
as a form of energy.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.520
If you work too hard, we know
that stress can also lead

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.920
to a lot of hormonal
imbalances within us.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.840
The insulin and glucagon, which are
these two hormones that work

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.800
in consonance with each other,
one increases sugar levels,
the other drops it down,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.000
that can lead to insulin spikes
if you eat too much,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.680
or if you eat at hours
that are not appropriate.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.320
Then, that sugar gets converted
to triglycerides, can lead to heart disease,

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.320
so on and so forth. 
So, all of this is
a very complex interplay.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.720
It's difficult 
to tease out the differences

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.440
between the energy centers per se.
They're all integrated;
they all work together.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.280
But, again, through Sahaj,
a balanced lifestyle,

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:58.240
maintaining a sense of
personal dignity, satisfaction,

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.080
and making sure that you work hard,
but you also take time

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.000
to relax a little bit,
that you give time for yourself,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.120
and that is best through meditation,
that you put your system, reset it,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.520
and you bring your
highly adrenalized system,

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.400
which can give rise to diseases,
like peptic ulcer for example,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.040
it's caused by Helicobacter pylori,
we know that,

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.360
but even then, it can give rise
to other inflammatory hormonal diseases.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.200
This interaction
between the immune system

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.800
and the system that we
spoke about before.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.320
So, lots of potential disorders
can be caused due to

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.120
the psychosomatic relationships,
but there is increasing evidence

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.080
that, for example, meditative practices
can help IBD-like conditions,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:57.040
ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease,
and other kinds of disorders as well.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.680
So, it's important to maintain a balance;
it's important to maintain

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.880
a sense of mastery, if you will.
Food is important,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.080
but if you get obsessed about it,
that's not nice either.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.640
And one should also know what is good
for one and what isn't.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.480
So, that sense of innate wisdom
is also possible.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.520
So, these are some of the things
that can throw this system off balance,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.520
but it's both: it's on the physical side,
thinking, activity, over-planning,

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.720
and on the emotional side,
or on the so-called other side,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.440
it's about avarice, it's about greed,
it's about lack of satisfaction,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.880
it's about being conditioned about
a particular kind of food all the time,

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.520
or just driving towards it.
Those are things that

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.800
can cause imbalances
in these energy centers,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.160
also the so-called Void,
the enteric nervous system.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.840
But, as you can see, it also has an impact
on the centers above and below it.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.960
It can cause issues with
your Muladhara chakra,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.040
it can also cause issues
with your Heart chakra,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.320
and also the Agnya chakra,
which is the sixth energy center.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.800
But we'll talk about that
as we go along.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.240
This information definitely is
very useful in itself,

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.840
and I think it also makes us realize
that we need to start having that shift

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.160
in our awareness and understanding,
to where we start knowing ourselves,

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.480
understanding ourselves
in a more integrated way.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.000
And I think, to that intent,
this series is becoming

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.640
more and more interesting
and more and more helpful.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.280
We do thank you, Dr. Ashish,
for your time today,

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.920
for sharing all of that
valuable information.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.320
And, as always, we will now
take our viewers

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.000
through a guided meditation
by the founder of this meditation,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.760
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.520
So, stay with us, and thank you,
Dr. Pradhan, for your time today.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.440
Thank you very much, Monikaji.
Always a pleasure.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.560
Look forward to the next one.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:05.440
Shri Mataji: Let us see how the seeking
comes within us, from where?

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:20.480
As shown here, there is a center
called as Nabhi chakra,

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.440
which is here in the center,
Nabhi chakra,

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:36.363
which is placed in our spinal cord,

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:54.545
and manifests the solar plexus,
which is placed midway under your navel.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.920
This is the center that creates
the seeking within us.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:13.280
Seeking is only possible
when something is living.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:25.280
A little bit, if you understand
that a desire is created

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:36.520
within a little animal called an amoeba
by giving him hunger.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:44.480
Just think of it. It has no brain;
it has just a small nucleus,

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:51.040
but it can feel it is hungry.
It has to eat something to grow.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:36:04.440
It also knows it has to reproduce,
and then it starts seeking.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:13.360
It also knows how to take the food in,
but it does not know how it digests.

00:36:15.848 --> 00:36:25.000
That part is not its job.
Even for us, just the same.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.400
So, the seeking starts
in a little amoeba,

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.040
and the whole evolution 
is based on that seeking,

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:48.640
gradually improving and improving
the ways and means of seeking,

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:54.640
while the desire is that
of food only, alone.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.920
Keep your eyes closed.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.800
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.800
All the time the left hand is towards Me.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:27.120
Now, here you have to say in your heart,
with all sincerity, Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.760
Ask the question three times
in your heart.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.870
This is a very fundamental question.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:59.120
Now bring the right hand
on to the left hand side of your stomach,

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.040
in the upper part.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.400
Here press it.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:12.880
Now this is the center of your mastery,
your guidance, your guru Tattva, as they say.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.280
So ask a question,
Mother, am I my own master?

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.600
This is the question to be asked
three times.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.431
Mother, am I my own master?

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:45.360
Now bring your right hand down below
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:53.040
Now this is the center from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.840
all the pure work is done.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.960
So to ask six times,
because this center has got six petals,

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.640
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.840
Six times you just ask.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:15.071
As a result of this asking
the Kundalini starts getting awakened.

00:39:25.951 --> 00:39:30.720
Now to help the Kundalini to rise
you have to cooperate with Her.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.880
So please put your right hand
on the left hand side

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:44.080
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it on the stomach.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.760
Now here you have to say
with full confidence,

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:56.480
to help the Kundalini to rise,
Mother, I am my own master.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.720
This you have to say ten times.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.760
These are the ten commandments
which you have to say,

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.495
that Mother, I am my own master.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:49.280
Now, ten times with full confidence.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:59.360
Now please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:06.240
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.640
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.040
This is the truth, you are the Spirit.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.480
But you have to say with full confidence,
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.236
This you have to say twelve times.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:55.840
Now one has to know
that God Almighty is the ocean of love.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.720
But above all He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.560
So He forgives.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.200
Whatever wrong you do He forgives.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:12.880
So don't feel guilty
and put your right hand across

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:21.360
on the left hand side in the corner
which is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.520
Now here you have to say
again with full confidence,

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.280
sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.560
Please say it, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.000
Sixteen times.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.363
I am not guilty at all.

00:42:39.363 --> 00:42:47.499
Please say it.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:27.040
Now raise your hand across on your forehead
and it's a very important center.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:37.840
Here you have to say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.080
Please say it from your heart.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.160
How many times is not the point.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.560
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.240
Now some would say
that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:56.160
But it's a myth
that we do not forgive or we forgive.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.040
We do not do anything
in both the cases.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.040
But if we don't forgive
then we play into wrong hands.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:10.028
So please say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:24.640
Now please take your hand on the back agnya,
the same center, on the back side of your head

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:29.680
and allow your head to rest on it
and push it back a little bit.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.040
Now here you have to say
for your satisfaction,

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:43.520
because you always feel guilty,
that, O Divine, if I have done anything wrong,

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.830
please forgive me.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:45:01.040
Please forgive me, from your heart.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:07.600
Stretch your hand fully
and put your center of your palm

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:16.400
on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.600
Press it hard.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.120
Press hard your scalp.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:27.360
Now you have to move it seven times
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.640
Mother, please give us My Self-realization,
because I cannot force on you.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.360
So you have to ask for it.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:43.920
Seven times press it hard
and move it seven times very hard.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.214
Slowly saying that.
