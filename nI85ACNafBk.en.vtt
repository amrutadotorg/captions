00:01.720 --> 00:10.353
1987-0111 Commitment and Dedication Puja, Paithan, India

09:55.013 --> 09:58.461
You must have felt the vibrations of this place,

09:58.661 --> 10:02.911
they are tremendous. And that we should come here

10:03.111 --> 10:10.069
after so many years is really very much surprising.

10:13.231 --> 10:18.533
This place has a great connection with me, as such,

10:18.733 --> 10:24.001
because my forefathers ruled in this place.

10:24.201 --> 10:30.505
And this was the capital of Shalivahanas.

10:30.705 --> 10:36.137
It’s called as "Pratishthan" but then they made it easier as "Paithan".

10:36.337 --> 10:39.823
They were the rulers here for thousands of years

10:40.023 --> 10:45.276
and they are the ones who started this Shalivahan dynasty.

10:45.476 --> 10:53.193
Actually they called themselves as "Satvahan", means "seven vahanas".

10:53.393 --> 10:59.877
They represented the seven vahanas of the seven chakras.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.018
It’s surprising how it is so Sahaja.

11:03.218 --> 11:10.271
After that there was a great poet as you know about him, Gyaneshwara.

11:10.471 --> 11:14.524
He came here and he was born very close to this place.

11:14.724 --> 11:18.290
He was here for quite some time.

11:18.490 --> 11:24.730
And there was one fellow, who was a very supra-conscious person,

11:24.930 --> 11:32.343
who challenged him. His name was Changdev. So he said that,

11:32.543 --> 11:39.710
"What do you have with you to show that you have got God with you?"

11:39.910 --> 11:48.696
And there was a male buffalo with him, male buffalo,

11:48.897 --> 11:54.716
which was just walking on the road,

11:54.916 --> 12:01.799
and Gyaneshwara made that buffalo say Veda mantras.

12:03.542 --> 12:09.170
And this Changdev tried to show some tricks.

12:09.370 --> 12:12.165
And Gyaneshwara, with his brothers and sister,

12:12.365 --> 12:16.173
were sitting on a broken wall

12:16.373 --> 12:23.145
and he made the wall to move with all of them in the air.

12:23.345 --> 12:25.848
And then he realised, Changdev,

12:26.048 --> 12:31.157
that this is sort of an incarnation on this Earth.

12:31.357 --> 12:37.629
Apart from there is another great poet called Eknath

12:37.829 --> 12:43.019
who wrote lots of folk songs, like Namadeva,

12:43.219 --> 12:48.801
describing Sahaja Yoga.

12:49.699 --> 12:56.924
So this place had some sort of attractive focus of vibrations

12:57.125 --> 13:05.497
for all these great saint to come and settle down here.

13:05.697 --> 13:10.536
They have excavated lots of old things about this place

13:10.736 --> 13:17.826
and the sari that is given to Goddess here is made in this place,

13:18.026 --> 13:20.444
called as paithani.

13:20.645 --> 13:24.474
It started at the time of Shalivahana and that art is still there.

13:24.674 --> 13:29.002
That’s the only sari in which they use real gold

13:29.202 --> 13:35.605
as the thread, real gold,just for the Goddess.

13:35.805 --> 13:40.652
So this place is still very vibrating.

13:40.852 --> 13:47.081
It’s out of the way to the people to come down, thank God,

13:47.281 --> 13:53.335
so is still maintained its own vibrations,
and its goodness and its purity.

13:53.535 --> 13:58.069
And you are all very lucky people in this group to have come to this place

13:58.269 --> 14:03.119
and to have visited this.

14:03.319 --> 14:07.260
As you will go round, you will see there’s a beautiful garden next to it.

14:07.460 --> 14:13.626
The River Godavari is called The Ganga, The Ganges of the South.

14:13.826 --> 14:18.486
It starts from Nasik where you were before and then brought here.

14:18.686 --> 14:25.450
And a big dam is made for the supply of water all over,

14:25.650 --> 14:29.625
which you can see on your way. There’s a beautiful garden nearby.

14:29.825 --> 14:32.523
And Eknath’s temple is just behind here,

14:32.723 --> 14:39.007
so we can all go and have a look at it also.

14:44.156 --> 14:48.374
I’m happy you went and saw Ajanta Caves.

14:48.574 --> 14:52.397
It should show you how people were dedicated,

14:52.597 --> 14:55.874
to build all that in ten centuries.

14:56.074 --> 15:01.718
They had not seen Buddha at all. Buddha never came to the South of India.

15:01.918 --> 15:07.152
Just believing in Buddha, what work they did, what sacrifices.

15:07.352 --> 15:11.941
How they built it?

15:12.141 --> 15:15.171
They had to go through very difficult times

15:15.371 --> 15:20.381
because there was no water, there was no communication, nothing.

15:20.581 --> 15:23.150
And they used the stones, you must have seen there,

15:23.350 --> 15:27.228
of different colours and different hues,

15:27.428 --> 15:30.497
which are created by Mother Earth. And when you break them,

15:30.697 --> 15:34.778
inside those egg-like stones,

15:34.978 --> 15:40.617
you get beautiful semi-precious stones.

15:40.817 --> 15:44.844
They dissolve them in some sort of an indigenous solvent

15:45.044 --> 15:49.621
and use it for painting and that’s how the paintings are today surviving.

15:49.821 --> 15:51.821
You can’t see without lights,

15:52.022 --> 15:54.667
so how they must have painted it at that time?

15:54.867 --> 15:57.491
What sort of eyes they must be having?

15:57.691 --> 16:02.522
Their dedication gave them this power that they could build it.

16:02.722 --> 16:06.486
And they carried on for ten centuries this work.

16:06.686 --> 16:09.431
If Sahaja Yoga can carried for ten centuries,

16:09.631 --> 16:14.002
this world would be a different place.

16:14.202 --> 16:19.572
So, one has to learn that we have to dedicate.

16:19.772 --> 16:23.725
We must full dedicate ourselves.

16:23.925 --> 16:27.264
We are not here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga.

16:27.464 --> 16:32.908
Like, in the beginning people have problems about their families

16:33.108 --> 16:35.253
so they think that God should solve the problem

16:35.453 --> 16:38.220
because they have come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga now,

16:38.420 --> 16:40.423
so God must solve their problems.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.716
Now, they have problems with their jobs, God must solve their problem.

16:43.916 --> 16:47.575
If they have problems with their relations, God must solve the problem.

16:47.775 --> 16:49.790
That’s a sort of job given to God

16:49.991 --> 16:53.140
because they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga.

16:53.341 --> 16:56.461
Then, after that God must give them money,

16:56.661 --> 17:01.042
He must provide them for everything and He must look after them,

17:01.242 --> 17:04.222
for no commitment at all, there’s no commitment,

17:04.422 --> 17:06.769
nobody has any commitment in Sahaja Yoga.

17:06.969 --> 17:09.862
But God is committed and God has to work it out.

17:10.062 --> 17:13.863
Then they start, some people foolishly start using in Sahaja Yoga

17:14.063 --> 17:19.246
for other purposes, like earning money or earning power,

17:19.446 --> 17:25.395
or name or fame or domination or anything.

17:26.371 --> 17:32.775
These are the steps which are going down, not upwards.

17:32.976 --> 17:35.213
And then, once you go down, you don’t realise

17:35.413 --> 17:38.912
whether you are going upward or downward.

17:39.112 --> 17:44.763
So in dedication one has to see, "What have I dedicated for Sahaja Yoga?

17:44.963 --> 17:47.735
All the time, I have problems. All the time I say,

17:47.935 --> 17:51.181
'I can’t do this because of that. I can’t do that because of this,

17:51.381 --> 17:54.454
this is the problem, this I would like to do this I would like to do.'"

17:54.654 --> 17:58.133
All the time there’s an "I, I, I and I".

17:58.334 --> 18:04.191
"But what have I dedicated? What time have given to Sahaja Yoga?

18:04.391 --> 18:10.340
How much money have I given to Sahaja Yoga?" Nothing at all.

18:11.387 --> 18:13.963
People don’t even take leave for Sahaja Yoga.

18:14.163 --> 18:17.737
They can’t do anything for it. These people not only took leave

18:17.937 --> 18:20.682
but permanently went and settled in that place,

18:20.882 --> 18:24.568
in that farfetched place, without any machinery, without anything.

18:24.768 --> 18:30.302
They did that whole painting and the whole excavation

18:30.502 --> 18:34.931
and all that, what you call, the entire work

18:35.131 --> 18:43.176
of such a tremendous volume that is impossible in these modern times.

18:43.376 --> 18:46.652
Nobody can recreate something like that, with your machinery,

18:46.852 --> 18:50.633
with everything because people don’t have dedication.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.735
So for Sahaja Yoga we have to put ourselves onto a point,

18:53.935 --> 18:58.777
"What did I do? What did I sacrifice for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing.

18:58.977 --> 19:03.261
It’s only for my own child, or maybe for my wife, or for myself,

19:03.461 --> 19:08.389
or for my job, or for something."

19:08.589 --> 19:12.623
What is our commitment?

19:12.824 --> 19:16.065
And without commitment purity cannot come in.

19:16.265 --> 19:21.409
You’ll go up and down like a yo-yo.

19:21.609 --> 19:24.576
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga.

19:24.776 --> 19:28.678
If there are even five people

19:28.878 --> 19:31.154
who were really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga,

19:31.354 --> 19:36.102
it can be built up that way.

19:38.865 --> 19:43.020
But the problem is everybody shares with each other,

19:43.220 --> 19:46.582
this kind of non-committal behaviour.

19:46.782 --> 19:50.301
And that’s something not good.

19:50.501 --> 19:53.680
Committed means that even if we have to give our life,

19:53.881 --> 19:56.279
we should do it;

19:56.480 --> 20:02.675
even if we have to give up everything, we should do it.

20:02.875 --> 20:06.073
But all other considerations are to be taken there,

20:06.273 --> 20:10.459
everything should work out, it all should be joy all the time,

20:10.659 --> 20:12.896
you must get your jobs, you must get your wives,

20:13.096 --> 20:15.537
you must get everything, children, properly done.

20:15.737 --> 20:21.443
Everything to be done by Sahaja Yoga.

20:22.631 --> 20:24.923
And when this commitment will start,

20:25.123 --> 20:28.993
I’m sure Sahaja Yoga will spread likely.

20:29.193 --> 20:32.649
Even falsehood when people are committed,

20:32.849 --> 20:34.856
like you see in all other religions,

20:35.057 --> 20:41.481
every religion they did that,
and how much it has spread.

20:41.681 --> 20:44.253
Of course Sahaja Yoga is blessings, is blissful,

20:44.453 --> 20:46.872
it blesses you all the time.

20:47.072 --> 20:50.211
It gives you a very long rope to hang you also sometimes.

20:50.411 --> 20:54.485
One must know that is a blessing of that kind also.

20:54.685 --> 20:57.292
So one has to be very, very alert

20:57.492 --> 21:01.253
that God has chosen us for such a special work

21:01.453 --> 21:08.520
and we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.

21:08.721 --> 21:13.624
All those who are wise will take this and understand

21:13.824 --> 21:19.142
that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it’s useless,

21:19.342 --> 21:23.325
it’s good for nothing,

21:23.525 --> 21:27.505
it has no meaning.

21:27.705 --> 21:33.152
And this has to come first from the leaders and then from others:

21:33.353 --> 21:40.163
complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.

21:40.364 --> 21:44.239
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up anything.

21:44.439 --> 21:47.496
For my sake, you don’t have to do anything, but for your own sake,

21:47.696 --> 21:52.227
for your own betterment, you have to do it.

21:52.427 --> 21:54.693
I hope next time when you come to India,

21:54.893 --> 22:01.474
you will be coming better prepared for commitments.

22:01.805 --> 22:05.633
It’s not only money, it’s not only

22:05.834 --> 22:08.808
your talking about, your saying about it, writing about it,

22:09.008 --> 22:13.466
but it is through your own being it should happen.

22:13.666 --> 22:17.208
You all should become the source of energy

22:17.408 --> 22:21.781
that I want to emit all over the world,

22:21.981 --> 22:25.703
that light which is going to enlighten.

22:25.903 --> 22:28.839
No amount of artificiality is going to work it out,

22:29.039 --> 22:31.651
but complete genuineness within you.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.893
Look at these saints, they had nobody, they didn’t have Mother

22:35.093 --> 22:39.241
to help them. Gyaneshwara’s life if you read, you will be shocked.

22:39.441 --> 22:45.798
He didn’t have even shoes to walk. He was treated so badly

22:45.998 --> 22:49.150
because his father was a sanyasi and was married

22:49.350 --> 22:52.009
so they said that, "These are the children of a sanyasi."

22:52.209 --> 22:56.645
They had no food to eat, and they have to walk for miles together barefoot.

22:56.845 --> 22:59.372
They had no blessings of The Mother on them.

22:59.572 --> 23:02.155
Despite that they kept to Sahaja Yoga,

23:02.355 --> 23:09.105
they kept to their blessings of being one with God.

23:10.217 --> 23:13.908
Because they achieved that state.

23:14.108 --> 23:22.637
Now all this is for your good, for your benevolence

23:22.837 --> 23:25.512
that you get all the blessings. But that doesn’t mean

23:25.712 --> 23:29.625
that you should stagnate, that you should not progress.

23:29.825 --> 23:33.523
One has to progress higher and higher.

23:33.723 --> 23:38.897
One has to decide the commitment: "I am committed to Sahaja Yoga",

23:39.098 --> 23:44.308
That is what you have to be, committed.

23:44.508 --> 23:47.433
May God bless you all.
