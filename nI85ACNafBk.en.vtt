1987-0111 Commitment and Dedication Puja, Paithan, India

00:09:55.013 --> 00:09:58.461
You must have felt the vibrations of this place,

00:09:58.661 --> 00:10:02.911
they are tremendous. And that we should come here

00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:10.069
after so many years is really very much surprising.

00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:18.533
This place has a great connection with me, as such,

00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:24.001
because my forefathers ruled in this place.

00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:30.505
And this was the capital of Shalivahanas.

00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:36.137
It’s called as "Pratishthan" but then they made it easier as "Paithan".

00:10:36.337 --> 00:10:39.823
They were the rulers here for thousands of years

00:10:40.023 --> 00:10:45.276
and they are the ones who started this Shalivahan dynasty.

00:10:45.476 --> 00:10:53.193
Actually they called themselves as "Satvahan", means "seven vahanas".

00:10:53.393 --> 00:10:59.877
They represented the seven vahanas of the seven chakras.

00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:03.018
It’s surprising how it is so Sahaja.

00:11:03.218 --> 00:11:10.271
After that there was a great poet as you know about him, Gyaneshwara.

00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:14.524
He came here and he was born very close to this place.

00:11:14.724 --> 00:11:18.290
He was here for quite some time.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:24.730
And there was one fellow, who was a very supra-conscious person,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:32.343
who challenged him. His name was Changdev. So he said that,

00:11:32.543 --> 00:11:39.710
"What do you have with you to show that you have got God with you?"

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:48.696
And there was a male buffalo with him, male buffalo,

00:11:48.897 --> 00:11:54.716
which was just walking on the road,

00:11:54.916 --> 00:12:01.799
and Gyaneshwara made that buffalo say Veda mantras.

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:09.170
And this Changdev tried to show some tricks.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.165
And Gyaneshwara, with his brothers and sister,

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:16.173
were sitting on a broken wall

00:12:16.373 --> 00:12:23.145
and he made the wall to move with all of them in the air.

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.848
And then he realised, Changdev,

00:12:26.048 --> 00:12:31.157
that this is sort of an incarnation on this Earth.

00:12:31.357 --> 00:12:37.629
Apart from there is another great poet called Eknath

00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:43.019
who wrote lots of folk songs, like Namadeva,

00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:48.801
describing Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:56.924
So this place had some sort of attractive focus of vibrations

00:12:57.125 --> 00:13:05.497
for all these great saint to come and settle down here.

00:13:05.697 --> 00:13:10.536
They have excavated lots of old things about this place

00:13:10.736 --> 00:13:17.826
and the sari that is given to Goddess here is made in this place,

00:13:18.026 --> 00:13:20.444
called as paithani.

00:13:20.645 --> 00:13:24.474
It started at the time of Shalivahana and that art is still there.

00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:29.002
That’s the only sari in which they use real gold

00:13:29.202 --> 00:13:35.605
as the thread, real gold,just for the Goddess.

00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:40.652
So this place is still very vibrating.

00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:47.081
It’s out of the way to the people to come down, thank God,

00:13:47.281 --> 00:13:53.335
so is still maintained its own vibrations,
and its goodness and its purity.

00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:58.069
And you are all very lucky people in this group to have come to this place

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:03.119
and to have visited this.

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:07.260
As you will go round, you will see there’s a beautiful garden next to it.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:13.626
The River Godavari is called The Ganga, The Ganges of the South.

00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:18.486
It starts from Nasik where you were before and then brought here.

00:14:18.686 --> 00:14:25.450
And a big dam is made for the supply of water all over,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.625
which you can see on your way. There’s a beautiful garden nearby.

00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:32.523
And Eknath’s temple is just behind here,

00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:39.007
so we can all go and have a look at it also.

00:14:44.156 --> 00:14:48.374
I’m happy you went and saw Ajanta Caves.

00:14:48.574 --> 00:14:52.397
It should show you how people were dedicated,

00:14:52.597 --> 00:14:55.874
to build all that in ten centuries.

00:14:56.074 --> 00:15:01.718
They had not seen Buddha at all. Buddha never came to the South of India.

00:15:01.918 --> 00:15:07.152
Just believing in Buddha, what work they did, what sacrifices.

00:15:07.352 --> 00:15:11.941
How they built it?

00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:15.171
They had to go through very difficult times

00:15:15.371 --> 00:15:20.381
because there was no water, there was no communication, nothing.

00:15:20.581 --> 00:15:23.150
And they used the stones, you must have seen there,

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:27.228
of different colours and different hues,

00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:30.497
which are created by Mother Earth. And when you break them,

00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:34.778
inside those egg-like stones,

00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:40.617
you get beautiful semi-precious stones.

00:15:40.817 --> 00:15:44.844
They dissolve them in some sort of an indigenous solvent

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:49.621
and use it for painting and that’s how the paintings are today surviving.

00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:51.821
You can’t see without lights,

00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:54.667
so how they must have painted it at that time?

00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:57.491
What sort of eyes they must be having?

00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:02.522
Their dedication gave them this power that they could build it.

00:16:02.722 --> 00:16:06.486
And they carried on for ten centuries this work.

00:16:06.686 --> 00:16:09.431
If Sahaja Yoga can carried for ten centuries,

00:16:09.631 --> 00:16:14.002
this world would be a different place.

00:16:14.202 --> 00:16:19.572
So, one has to learn that we have to dedicate.

00:16:19.772 --> 00:16:23.725
We must full dedicate ourselves.

00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:27.264
We are not here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:32.908
Like, in the beginning people have problems about their families

00:16:33.108 --> 00:16:35.253
so they think that God should solve the problem

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.220
because they have come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga now,

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.423
so God must solve their problems.

00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:43.716
Now, they have problems with their jobs, God must solve their problem.

00:16:43.916 --> 00:16:47.575
If they have problems with their relations, God must solve the problem.

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:49.790
That’s a sort of job given to God

00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:53.140
because they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:56.461
Then, after that God must give them money,

00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:01.042
He must provide them for everything and He must look after them,

00:17:01.242 --> 00:17:04.222
for no commitment at all, there’s no commitment,

00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:06.769
nobody has any commitment in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:06.969 --> 00:17:09.862
But God is committed and God has to work it out.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:13.863
Then they start, some people foolishly start using in Sahaja Yoga

00:17:14.063 --> 00:17:19.246
for other purposes, like earning money or earning power,

00:17:19.446 --> 00:17:25.395
or name or fame or domination or anything.

00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:32.775
These are the steps which are going down, not upwards.

00:17:32.976 --> 00:17:35.213
And then, once you go down, you don’t realise

00:17:35.413 --> 00:17:38.912
whether you are going upward or downward.

00:17:39.112 --> 00:17:44.763
So in dedication one has to see, "What have I dedicated for Sahaja Yoga?

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:47.735
All the time, I have problems. All the time I say,

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:51.181
'I can’t do this because of that. I can’t do that because of this,

00:17:51.381 --> 00:17:54.454
this is the problem, this I would like to do this I would like to do.'"

00:17:54.654 --> 00:17:58.133
All the time there’s an "I, I, I and I".

00:17:58.334 --> 00:18:04.191
"But what have I dedicated? What time have given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:04.391 --> 00:18:10.340
How much money have I given to Sahaja Yoga?" Nothing at all.

00:18:11.387 --> 00:18:13.963
People don’t even take leave for Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:14.163 --> 00:18:17.737
They can’t do anything for it. These people not only took leave

00:18:17.937 --> 00:18:20.682
but permanently went and settled in that place,

00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:24.568
in that farfetched place, without any machinery, without anything.

00:18:24.768 --> 00:18:30.302
They did that whole painting and the whole excavation

00:18:30.502 --> 00:18:34.931
and all that, what you call, the entire work

00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:43.176
of such a tremendous volume that is impossible in these modern times.

00:18:43.376 --> 00:18:46.652
Nobody can recreate something like that, with your machinery,

00:18:46.852 --> 00:18:50.633
with everything because people don’t have dedication.

00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:53.735
So for Sahaja Yoga we have to put ourselves onto a point,

00:18:53.935 --> 00:18:58.777
"What did I do? What did I sacrifice for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing.

00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:03.261
It’s only for my own child, or maybe for my wife, or for myself,

00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:08.389
or for my job, or for something."

00:19:08.589 --> 00:19:12.623
What is our commitment?

00:19:12.824 --> 00:19:16.065
And without commitment purity cannot come in.

00:19:16.265 --> 00:19:21.409
You’ll go up and down like a yo-yo.

00:19:21.609 --> 00:19:24.576
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:28.678
If there are even five people

00:19:28.878 --> 00:19:31.154
who were really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:31.354 --> 00:19:36.102
it can be built up that way.

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:43.020
But the problem is everybody shares with each other,

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.582
this kind of non-committal behaviour.

00:19:46.782 --> 00:19:50.301
And that’s something not good.

00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:53.680
Committed means that even if we have to give our life,

00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:56.279
we should do it;

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.675
even if we have to give up everything, we should do it.

00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:06.073
But all other considerations are to be taken there,

00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:10.459
everything should work out, it all should be joy all the time,

00:20:10.659 --> 00:20:12.896
you must get your jobs, you must get your wives,

00:20:13.096 --> 00:20:15.537
you must get everything, children, properly done.

00:20:15.737 --> 00:20:21.443
Everything to be done by Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:24.923
And when this commitment will start,

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:28.993
I’m sure Sahaja Yoga will spread likely.

00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:32.649
Even falsehood when people are committed,

00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:34.856
like you see in all other religions,

00:20:35.057 --> 00:20:41.481
every religion they did that,
and how much it has spread.

00:20:41.681 --> 00:20:44.253
Of course Sahaja Yoga is blessings, is blissful,

00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:46.872
it blesses you all the time.

00:20:47.072 --> 00:20:50.211
It gives you a very long rope to hang you also sometimes.

00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:54.485
One must know that is a blessing of that kind also.

00:20:54.685 --> 00:20:57.292
So one has to be very, very alert

00:20:57.492 --> 00:21:01.253
that God has chosen us for such a special work

00:21:01.453 --> 00:21:08.520
and we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:08.721 --> 00:21:13.624
All those who are wise will take this and understand

00:21:13.824 --> 00:21:19.142
that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it’s useless,

00:21:19.342 --> 00:21:23.325
it’s good for nothing,

00:21:23.525 --> 00:21:27.505
it has no meaning.

00:21:27.705 --> 00:21:33.152
And this has to come first from the leaders and then from others:

00:21:33.353 --> 00:21:40.163
complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:40.364 --> 00:21:44.239
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up anything.

00:21:44.439 --> 00:21:47.496
For my sake, you don’t have to do anything, but for your own sake,

00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:52.227
for your own betterment, you have to do it.

00:21:52.427 --> 00:21:54.693
I hope next time when you come to India,

00:21:54.893 --> 00:22:01.474
you will be coming better prepared for commitments.

00:22:01.805 --> 00:22:05.633
It’s not only money, it’s not only

00:22:05.834 --> 00:22:08.808
your talking about, your saying about it, writing about it,

00:22:09.008 --> 00:22:13.466
but it is through your own being it should happen.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:17.208
You all should become the source of energy

00:22:17.408 --> 00:22:21.781
that I want to emit all over the world,

00:22:21.981 --> 00:22:25.703
that light which is going to enlighten.

00:22:25.903 --> 00:22:28.839
No amount of artificiality is going to work it out,

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:31.651
but complete genuineness within you.

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:34.893
Look at these saints, they had nobody, they didn’t have Mother

00:22:35.093 --> 00:22:39.241
to help them. Gyaneshwara’s life if you read, you will be shocked.

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:45.798
He didn’t have even shoes to walk. He was treated so badly

00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:49.150
because his father was a sanyasi and was married

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.009
so they said that, "These are the children of a sanyasi."

00:22:52.209 --> 00:22:56.645
They had no food to eat, and they have to walk for miles together barefoot.

00:22:56.845 --> 00:22:59.372
They had no blessings of The Mother on them.

00:22:59.572 --> 00:23:02.155
Despite that they kept to Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:09.105
they kept to their blessings of being one with God.

00:23:10.217 --> 00:23:13.908
Because they achieved that state.

00:23:14.108 --> 00:23:22.637
Now all this is for your good, for your benevolence

00:23:22.837 --> 00:23:25.512
that you get all the blessings. But that doesn’t mean

00:23:25.712 --> 00:23:29.625
that you should stagnate, that you should not progress.

00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:33.523
One has to progress higher and higher.

00:23:33.723 --> 00:23:38.897
One has to decide the commitment: "I am committed to Sahaja Yoga",

00:23:39.098 --> 00:23:44.308
That is what you have to be, committed.

00:23:44.508 --> 00:23:47.433
May God bless you all.
