01:09.040 --> 01:13.880
The other day I talked to you about

01:14.080 --> 01:19.600
the importance of dedication in Sahaja Yoga

01:19.840 --> 01:24.000
and the devotion that one should have.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.560
Actually, when we are close to the mountain,

01:30.760 --> 01:33.560
we can’t see much of it,

01:33.800 --> 01:37.240
and that’s why we don’t realize

01:37.680 --> 01:41.720
the volume that is so close to us,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.720
the greatness that is facing us.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.720
This is one of the illusions that works out

01:53.920 --> 01:59.840
for people who do not realize it mentally —

02:00.160 --> 02:02.720
what they are in for,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.280
where are they, what have they found,

02:05.520 --> 02:08.720
what is Self-realization, what is its magnitude,

02:08.960 --> 02:11.880
how far they have to go,

02:13.880 --> 02:18.480
why are they chosen, what is their purpose of life,

02:18.840 --> 02:26.440
how far they have come up, how far they can understand.

02:26.760 --> 02:31.040
All these things are beyond the grasp,

02:31.240 --> 02:35.080
and one gets stunned, one doesn’t know

02:35.320 --> 02:40.960
what has happened to him when he got Realization actually.

02:44.080 --> 02:49.560
That’s why to understand this is only possible

02:49.800 --> 02:54.320
if you can understand how to dedicate,

02:54.600 --> 02:57.680
how to devote yourself.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.280
If you want to analyze anything

03:01.520 --> 03:05.800
on the basis of your rationality, you are too stunned.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.800
It’s too beyond you. It’s fantastic.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.000
It is too much. It’s really beyond you.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.880
Now think of it — you have got Realization. Can you believe it?

03:16.160 --> 03:18.200
That you can, in your life time…

03:18.440 --> 03:21.880
if somebody had told you this, you would never have believed it —

03:22.120 --> 03:25.600
that how can you get your Realization in this earth?

03:25.840 --> 03:27.040
Of course you were seeking —

03:27.240 --> 03:29.000
because people were saying we have to seek,

03:29.200 --> 03:30.480
also you felt you have to seek —

03:30.680 --> 03:34.160
but you never thought that this will materialize like this,

03:34.360 --> 03:35.920
that you will get your Realization.

03:36.120 --> 03:41.840
Then, after getting Realization, you could not feel what it was.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.040
Just if you have dropped into the ocean,

03:44.240 --> 03:47.360
and you don’t know what is the dimension of this ocean.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.800
How far you have gone into it?

03:50.080 --> 03:54.960
What is it? Where are we? What is our purpose?

03:55.240 --> 03:59.160
To add up to all the mess, we become thoughtless.

04:01.520 --> 04:09.520
So you cannot even find out as to, rationally, what it is.

04:09.720 --> 04:14.880
So, the immensity of this experience,

04:16.800 --> 04:22.760
the glory of your Mother’s coming,

04:23.960 --> 04:27.360
or the precious gift of your Self-realization —

04:27.600 --> 04:31.560
nothing can be realized through your understanding.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.320
Try to think — what have you got?

04:35.560 --> 04:38.320
Can you measure it with your understanding?

04:38.560 --> 04:42.000
Can you understand what has happened?

04:42.280 --> 04:44.200
No, you cannot.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.560
Because rationality cannot give you

04:46.760 --> 04:50.560
the dimensions into which you have fallen.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.520
The rationality is actually broken out.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.080
There is no rationality left now anymore

04:57.400 --> 05:01.400
to even communicate as to what you have been

05:01.680 --> 05:04.120
seeking and where have you landed.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.680
So the only method you have got now —

05:08.880 --> 05:10.680
or only way is left to you —

05:10.960 --> 05:13.720
for a drop which has become an ocean,

05:13.960 --> 05:16.080
is to dissolve more in the ocean,

05:16.280 --> 05:19.880
so that you feel the ocean at least.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.480
And to communicate with other drops

05:22.720 --> 05:27.880
in such a way that you know the whole through all of them.

05:31.320 --> 05:37.280
So first is a complete devotion. It’s very important.

05:37.960 --> 05:42.120
In this incarnation only it is so very important —

05:42.360 --> 05:45.440
because you have got Realization.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.160
If you did not have Realization — all right.

05:48.400 --> 05:53.040
Murmuring souls — all right. Half-baked people — all right.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.200
Little bit misbehaving — all right.

05:56.520 --> 06:01.760
This can be forgiven, that can be forgiven… everything is forgiven.

06:01.960 --> 06:06.520
To look at it, everybody thinks that “Mother is forgiving us.”

06:06.840 --> 06:09.240
But that’s not the point.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.120
I am forgiving because of My own nature.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.080
But you do not take it for granted.

06:17.320 --> 06:21.800
You are harming yourself by accepting that forgiveness.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
If you all the time think,

06:23.320 --> 06:25.600
“O Mother, You are so forgiving, please forgive me”…

06:25.800 --> 06:27.120
you are already forgiven, as it is.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.920
Once you call Me “Mother”, you’re forgiven.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.000
But what’s the advantage?

06:31.240 --> 06:33.760
You don’t have any advantage out of it.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.040
You are a loser.

06:36.320 --> 06:40.960
And this point at least rationally if you understand,

06:41.240 --> 06:46.880
then you will understand what is a devotion.

06:48.760 --> 06:55.920
So, in devotion of Sahaja Yoga, one has to realize

06:56.200 --> 07:00.120
that the things that are in Sahaja Yoga,

07:00.320 --> 07:01.680
that you have seen in Sahaja Yoga,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.240
are beyond your mind — first thing.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.000
Definitely, they are beyond human conception.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.720
So, on human level, you do not discuss them,

07:09.960 --> 07:12.120
and you do not talk about them.

07:12.400 --> 07:18.280
But on the collective level you can talk.

07:19.080 --> 07:22.000
And when you come to the collective level,

07:22.320 --> 07:24.000
then you have to understand

07:24.240 --> 07:29.040
that relationship with Me is more established, better established

07:29.280 --> 07:34.160
if you establish your relationships with others,

07:34.360 --> 07:37.720
in a very collective and homogeneous way.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.800
As I told you, the drop becomes the ocean;

07:41.040 --> 07:42.880
and the drop has to become the ocean

07:43.080 --> 07:46.920
by dissolving all its “dropness”

07:48.640 --> 07:50.440
with other drops.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.840
And all the drops dropping their dropness

07:54.040 --> 07:57.040
become the ocean ultimately.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.880
So we’ll see that devotion is double-wedged:

08:01.120 --> 08:05.920
one is to each other, and one is to your Mother.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.680
In Sahaja Yoga, whatever I see, you cannot see.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.320
This is proved or not — to you people?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.160
Or do you want more proofs?

08:15.440 --> 08:18.120
Now it is proved that “Mother sees much beyond us,

08:18.320 --> 08:20.920
and whatever She sees happens.”

08:21.240 --> 08:24.960
So anybody who tries to play tricks with Mother

08:25.240 --> 08:28.720
is actually playing tricks with himself.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.560
Any tricks you try to play with Me, or you think

08:32.800 --> 08:35.280
that “Mother is very forgiving, so She will forgive us” —

08:35.520 --> 08:38.160
is really you are torturing yourself,

08:38.360 --> 08:40.680
you are… it is detrimental to you.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.760
Many people are there who will say that “It is my Left Swadisthana.”

08:44.960 --> 08:47.200
Some will say, “I was possessed; there was bhoot.”

08:47.480 --> 08:49.560
Somebody will blame something else.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.880
Whatever you are blaming —

08:51.120 --> 08:54.440
actually, who is asking you the explanation?

08:54.680 --> 08:57.640
It’s only you asking yourself.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.600
You are not facing yourself.

09:03.120 --> 09:08.800
So the devotion to Me means actually facing to yourself.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.240
You face yourself first of all,

09:11.480 --> 09:15.560
and see for yourself what are you doing.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.040
You are your own enemy; nobody is your enemy.

09:19.320 --> 09:24.920
Your Mother is not, definitely. She’s not your enemy by any chance.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.400
And no bhoots are your enemies — in the way,

09:28.640 --> 09:32.120
if you do not allow them, they can’t be there.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.040
No evil person is your enemy,

09:35.240 --> 09:40.760
because he cannot be effective if you are spiritually equipped.

09:41.040 --> 09:45.480
So you are your own enemy, is decided now.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.200
The only way to get rid of that enemy of yours -

09:50.400 --> 09:51.960
you have to dedicate.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.520
Supposing you say

09:55.800 --> 10:01.720
that “I have faith in Mother,” or “in God.”

10:02.720 --> 10:05.560
So you are holding on to something, isn’t it?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.880
And you are discarding something.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.680
But this hold has to be very strong.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.560
Rationally, if you at that time when you are sinking,

10:13.800 --> 10:16.520
will you rationalize, “Whether I should hold the hand

10:16.720 --> 10:19.320
of this person who is saving, is correct or not?”

10:19.560 --> 10:23.000
No, you’ll just… your grip will be very strong.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.440
It will be extremely strong,

10:24.640 --> 10:27.800
and you will grip it with full force, with full faith —

10:28.040 --> 10:31.160
that “Some or other, save me!”

10:32.480 --> 10:36.560
And that kind of a feeling should be within us

10:36.840 --> 10:42.840
that “I am a person who is sinking because of myself.

10:43.560 --> 10:50.240
And if I am to be saved, I have to be absolutely,

10:50.440 --> 10:55.480
completely submerged in Sahaja Yoga.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.840
Absolutely I have to become one with it,

11:00.120 --> 11:01.600
then only I can be saved.”

11:01.840 --> 11:03.160
Because at this level,

11:03.360 --> 11:07.320
where you are realized souls of a higher level…

11:07.520 --> 11:12.720
now for a next jump, as I was saying to you — is devotion.

11:12.920 --> 11:18.080
Anything else has to be secondary, under the circumstances.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.960
If it is primary

11:21.200 --> 11:24.960
and your attention is still on that,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.600
then you cannot have this second jump.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.600
First jump you have already done, you have got your Realization.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.240
But from first jump to second jump —

11:34.480 --> 11:37.200
you’ve worked hard, you have come to the second jump —

11:37.440 --> 11:41.560
in the second jump, you have to face it up.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.440
You should not feel disgusted with yourself

11:44.640 --> 11:46.720
nor dejected with yourself for nothing.

11:46.920 --> 11:50.960
But treat yourself as a separate entity.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.800
And dedication is, actually, turning back to yourself

11:55.000 --> 11:56.880
and looking forward

11:57.160 --> 12:02.440
towards the divine personality in you.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.760
Once there is divine personality in you,

12:05.040 --> 12:06.880
there’s no problem of devotion.

12:07.120 --> 12:12.240
You’ll just become one with it; you’ll start enjoying it.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.120
But this rationality is the worst thing,

12:16.320 --> 12:18.000
that plays tricks with you,

12:18.280 --> 12:21.600
which deviates you from understanding

12:21.880 --> 12:25.000
that whatever life you have led so far

12:25.280 --> 12:28.680
has been on a very material, gross life.

12:28.960 --> 12:33.560
You came out of it, you have grown out of it, you have come up.

12:33.800 --> 12:40.400
Now, to blossom, to become fragrant,

12:42.000 --> 12:47.640
you have to give up rationality. That’s a binding [POINT?].

12:48.240 --> 12:52.920
Try to avoid rationality, try to avoid arguments,

12:53.160 --> 12:55.960
try to avoid giving reasons and…

12:56.160 --> 12:59.320
Even now I find sometimes Sahaja Yogis give

12:59.520 --> 13:01.720
an explanation of psychology:

13:02.000 --> 13:05.200
“She might be insecured, Mother.”

13:05.480 --> 13:08.000
This is typically somewhere read in the book:

13:08.200 --> 13:10.400
“Because of insecurity, somebody does that.”

13:10.640 --> 13:12.880
Actually, now we have seen in Sahaja Yoga

13:13.080 --> 13:17.080
that most of the so-called insecured are the most aggressive people.

13:17.320 --> 13:22.240
They play tricks with others, spoil their lives — and enjoy it.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.760
They are the greatest sadists ever born.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.480
We have seen these people.

13:27.680 --> 13:32.240
“She is inse…” — and that’s how they play tricks with themselves.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.760
Now, once you understand

13:37.080 --> 13:39.000
that you are not to play tricks with yourself…

13:39.200 --> 13:42.800
why do you want to play tricks with yourself?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.920
You have to be yourself, that’s all.

13:46.160 --> 13:50.520
We should not be our own enemies. Are we?

13:50.840 --> 13:54.080
So, once you start facing yourself, you will like yourself.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.720
You won’t feel disgusted.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.120
Because that what “yourself” I’m talking about

13:58.360 --> 14:00.760
is glorious, is beautiful,

14:00.960 --> 14:05.880
is without any kalanka [blemish] on that, is absolutely detached.

14:06.160 --> 14:10.120
But, first of all, your attention has to accept it —

14:10.360 --> 14:15.000
that “This detachment is my life; I’m a different personality now.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.440
Detachment is my nourishment.”

14:22.880 --> 14:24.440
Detach yourself.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.600
One gentleman came to see Me in My house.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.560
I had a very beautiful lamp, and he liked it.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.640
I said, “You have it.” He was so amazed, you see.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.400
Wife telephoned to Me: “How could it be?

14:33.600 --> 14:36.000
How could You give away such a nice thing?” I said, “What’s there?

14:36.240 --> 14:38.800
Am I going to carry it with Me when I die?

14:39.080 --> 14:41.720
Is it going to go with Me? Just see rationally.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.360
If he has liked it, better have it.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.640
I have so many lamps in the house;

14:44.840 --> 14:47.760
if he takes one, what does it matter?”

14:48.040 --> 14:50.080
She said, “But, You see, I asked my husband,

14:50.280 --> 14:53.480
‘Will you give this lamp — like this if you had — to Her?’

14:53.800 --> 14:56.680
He said, ‘No, I would not.’

14:57.240 --> 14:59.000
‘I’m really… I would not’, he said.”

14:59.200 --> 15:01.120
He was very honest. He said, “I would not.”

15:01.440 --> 15:04.840
But still, I can’t understand why not?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.360
So, you know, till the last end

15:08.600 --> 15:12.280
we are holding on to something very little there.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.280
This… even a little bit is holding the sari.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.320
You know that, that can hold the whole sari.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.120
Even a little bit is attaching to this sari —

15:23.400 --> 15:25.000
the sari can be held back.

15:25.320 --> 15:28.440
The whole thing you can hold it with one little pin.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.800
All these small pins that are there — the hangs-up —

15:33.040 --> 15:38.320
are to be denied, to be seen… going further.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.680
Look at yourself: “Oh, that’s Mr. Ego?

15:40.880 --> 15:44.720
All right, now recede; let me see how do you go back.”

15:45.000 --> 15:46.560
To see all those things…

15:46.760 --> 15:49.160
you see, as a play, you should see yourself.

15:49.360 --> 15:53.040
And then play tricks with your ego and superego.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.840
Actually, they’re playing tricks with you.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.600
Once you are a master, you play tricks with them.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.760
So many times I have seen:

16:04.040 --> 16:08.080
I’ve said so many things, and they are again…

16:08.320 --> 16:11.800
then, after some time, people start talking about it.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.880
Within one or two months after that,

16:14.080 --> 16:16.400
it comes as a scientific proof or things like that.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.720
You have seen that, many a times it has happened.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.760
Now, when I say something, I’m sure about it, what I say.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.240
I never say anything but the truth.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.360
I know that I am saying only the truth.

16:26.600 --> 16:31.000
But I do not go inside and find out whether it is the truth or not.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.200
I don’t read a book to find out. I don’t ask you.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.080
I have faith in Myself, full faith in Myself.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.040
Whatever I say is the truth;

16:39.240 --> 16:44.720
I know for definite that I… whatever I say comes out truth.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.040
But that’s not your case.

16:48.640 --> 16:52.320
That’s not your case, that whatever you say is the truth.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.800
So first you have to establish this state —

16:55.000 --> 16:58.400
that “Whatever I say will be the truth.”

16:58.640 --> 17:02.040
Now, how do you do it? The tongue should be such

17:02.280 --> 17:04.200
that whatever you say should be the truth.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.640
Ultimately, it will come out as truth.

17:08.520 --> 17:12.520
And that is why the dedication should be there.

17:12.760 --> 17:17.480
What dedication? “Why should I tell lies?”

17:21.760 --> 17:24.960
There is no need to tell lies.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.520
Even if I tell lies, it will come truth — in My case.

17:28.720 --> 17:33.000
So-called lies. They are never lies.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.600
If I say to somebody, “He is a bad man” —

17:36.800 --> 17:41.520
apparently to you: “Oh, Mother, he is such a fine man!

17:41.760 --> 17:44.280
How can You say such a thing about him?”

17:44.480 --> 17:46.600
We had one Mr. Michael like that.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.760
“Oh, he is such a loving person, Mother.”

17:50.040 --> 17:53.360
Somebody said, “Mother, are you jealous of him?”

17:54.480 --> 17:57.240
Up to that extent, you know.

17:57.680 --> 18:02.080
But when he showed his real teeth, you see, then people knew.

18:02.400 --> 18:08.280
So, to develop that kind of understanding about the truth,

18:08.480 --> 18:14.400
first of all, you should absolutely fix yourself on the truth.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.560
And the truth is that you are the instrument of God,

18:17.800 --> 18:19.120
that you have got Realization,

18:19.360 --> 18:24.200
that you have got a special awareness,

18:24.480 --> 18:28.880
which people do not have. Stand on that.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.520
And proclaim it. You are not to be afraid of it.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.360
You have got Realization, no doubt. You have felt it.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.080
Say it: “I’ve got Realization.

18:37.320 --> 18:42.360
Nothing doing, I know I’m a realized soul.” Firm on that.

18:42.600 --> 18:47.040
In this expression of truth, you have to be like the light.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.680
The light asserts.

18:49.880 --> 18:54.080
It not only asserts but it shows others also that it shines.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.560
It shows others that “I am the light,”

18:58.800 --> 19:01.480
that “You walk in my light,

19:01.720 --> 19:06.120
and if you don’t try to do it, I may burn you.”

19:06.400 --> 19:10.320
So they have that… what you call, that…

19:11.040 --> 19:15.840
I don’t know what’s the word is… Tejasvita. Tejas.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.160
Sharpness of light.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.280
That tejasvita is there, that sharpness of light.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.200
That is the proof of your truth.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.280
You are not afraid of any prime minister,

19:26.480 --> 19:29.680
or any minister, or any king, or anyone.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.320
But — “This is the fact. That’s the thing.

19:32.520 --> 19:36.680
I know I am a realized soul, I am the truth.”

19:38.840 --> 19:41.960
If you say, “I’m the truth,” whatever you will say

19:42.200 --> 19:46.320
will be the truth, no doubt about it.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.840
Whatever you will do will be the truth. But say, “I’m the truth.”

19:51.160 --> 19:54.480
But for that, a real purification is needed

19:54.680 --> 19:58.960
about facing yourself fully, in dedication.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.280
Means you are holding on to your Mother,

20:01.520 --> 20:03.200
you are holding on to Sahaja Yoga,

20:03.440 --> 20:06.120
you are holding on to that truth which you have found out.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.840
And here you are facing others.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.800
Without that you cannot do it; your source is that.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.720
You are standing on the truth.

20:16.920 --> 20:22.880
And that is such a power, such a strength.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.560
All of them if you see — Christ had that power,

20:25.760 --> 20:28.280
Mohammed had that power — all these great people had that power

20:28.520 --> 20:34.200
to say the truth, with full courage,

20:34.440 --> 20:38.040
with that assertion that people will accept it.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.360
And they would suffer even for that, they wouldn’t mind.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.680
But whatever is the truth has to be said.

20:42.880 --> 20:47.000
That’s the first point one should know about dedication —

20:47.200 --> 20:49.560
that you are dedicated fully,

20:49.760 --> 20:52.960
that you are not afraid of anyone.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.600
You are not worried about your losses.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.600
Some people have lost their heads also,

20:59.840 --> 21:03.280
completely cut their heads. People have tortured them.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.440
Some people have been… taken away all their money,

21:06.640 --> 21:08.000
have been tortured in every way,

21:08.240 --> 21:10.400
but they thought this was the truth, they stood by it.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.440
Some of them were stupid fools; they stood for something

21:13.640 --> 21:15.360
that was not truth. They did.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.520
But now you know that you are standing on the truth,

21:18.720 --> 21:21.640
and for that, you should be willing to sacrifice anything —

21:21.840 --> 21:26.480
so-called sacrifice, because you are not sacrificing the truth.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.440
What you had tried sacrificing is untruth.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.720
For that, you require people of strength and courage,

21:32.960 --> 21:35.640
and not these half-baked people.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.200
You see, till morning till evening

21:37.400 --> 21:40.480
asking for forgiveness from Mother. What is it?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.320
What is there to ask for forgiveness —

21:42.560 --> 21:44.880
because I am forgiving you every moment.

21:45.120 --> 21:49.360
But what are you doing to yourself? What sort of a person you are?

21:51.120 --> 21:53.360
You think about it, that you have to stand on the truth.

21:53.560 --> 21:58.360
For that, you have to be a strong, courageous person

21:58.640 --> 22:01.880
with that sharpness, that tejasvita within you —

22:02.160 --> 22:05.200
of the light of the beacon.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.200
But at the same time, you have to have complete dedication.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.920
Supposing there is no oil in this — it will all go off.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.240
It has to have oil.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.480
It will go off.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.640
So the dedication part is the oil in you,

22:21.840 --> 22:26.720
is the attachment, complete attachment to your source.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.080
That’s the dedication.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.040
But that dedication should not give you

22:32.280 --> 22:38.240
any other ideas but of a light which shines,

22:39.680 --> 22:45.840
which corrects others, guides the path of other people.

22:46.080 --> 22:50.480
If that is not so, then the source that you are tapping

22:50.720 --> 22:52.840
is not coming to you fully,

22:53.080 --> 22:58.040
and that your light is not burning properly.

23:00.760 --> 23:04.640
So, into dedication when you go,

23:07.040 --> 23:11.720
you must not think that it is any surrendering —

23:11.920 --> 23:15.720
the so-called surrendering, that you become like a cabbage.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.760
That’s the idea people have — that you become like cabbage.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.600
But you become dynamic.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.640
You become real power —

23:29.880 --> 23:32.680
not of destruction but of construction.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.240
I mean, for destruction you don’t need much power.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.640
Only for construction you need power.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.600
For destruction how much do you need? Very little.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.040
You can destroy the whole thing in no time.

23:43.280 --> 23:51.680
But for the construction you really require great power.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.640
And that power — sustained power,

23:54.880 --> 23:57.760
or flowing power — has to be there.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.160
For that, dedication is needed.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.920
Holding on to your source of power,

24:05.160 --> 24:09.240
you have to stand firm, courageously,

24:09.560 --> 24:15.480
without any fear.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.440
That’s the truth.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.200
That’s the truth you have to achieve.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.440
That’s very important.

24:25.680 --> 24:30.040
But this is only one side of the story.

24:30.360 --> 24:34.920
That’s not sufficient. Just being the truth,

24:35.280 --> 24:39.880
the aspect of one side is there.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.640
But the other side of it is

24:42.920 --> 24:48.880
that when this source comes to you, you become the compassion.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.040
The truth and the compassion are one thing.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.520
You won’t believe, but it is so.

24:54.760 --> 25:00.720
Like the wick and the oil combine to form the light.

25:01.400 --> 25:06.080
It is the burning of the oil gives you the light.

25:06.320 --> 25:11.440
In the same way, the compassion gives you the truth.

25:11.680 --> 25:16.280
There’s no difference whatsoever. Only the state is different —

25:16.480 --> 25:19.960
that you cannot see the light, which is oil,

25:20.200 --> 25:23.800
and oil, which is burning.

25:24.640 --> 25:30.600
So compassion is the one which is the source,

25:31.040 --> 25:34.240
as well as your store.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.480
So, from the source of compassion,

25:38.960 --> 25:40.800
you get your compassion.

25:41.040 --> 25:45.200
You see, I have seen people — they want to have compassion from Me,

25:45.480 --> 25:47.880
they want that I should love them.

25:48.160 --> 25:52.240
But — reflect it back — do they love others like that?

25:52.480 --> 25:54.040
I have known people, they have…

25:54.240 --> 25:58.200
say, for one person says harsh thing to another,

25:58.480 --> 26:01.080
and comes and asks Me, “Mother, forgive me for that,”

26:01.320 --> 26:05.200
or does something harsh just for the whim of the mind.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.960
“Mother, forgive me.”

26:07.200 --> 26:11.240
But when you ask for that, I would like to know:

26:11.520 --> 26:14.960
have you given compassion to another person?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.720
Even after getting forgiveness from Me —

26:17.920 --> 26:22.360
that Source of forgiveness, that Source of compassion —

26:22.560 --> 26:24.840
have you given compassion to others?

26:25.160 --> 26:27.600
Have you been compassionate to others?

26:27.840 --> 26:30.960
You see, it should not be one-sided.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.800
If you are taking the advantage of My compassion,

26:35.040 --> 26:36.560
it should not be one-sided,

26:36.760 --> 26:40.120
that you use it for your own benefit and forget about it.

26:40.360 --> 26:45.280
Then you will never grow. You will never grow.

26:45.520 --> 26:50.440
If you have to grow, then you must store that compassion within you.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.240
Whatever compassion I’ve given you, love I’ve given you,

26:53.480 --> 26:59.360
you must store that within you — and give that back to others.

27:00.800 --> 27:05.600
Otherwise you will be finished, you will be nowhere.

27:05.840 --> 27:11.440
Is the growth which is sustained only…

27:11.640 --> 27:15.720
not only by sucking from one side but by giving to others.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.880
Otherwise you’ll be stagnated.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.200
There has to be outflow.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.280
But that is a very hard thing

27:25.520 --> 27:29.880
because people are very good at taking compassion from Mother.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.040
Or even if they are compassionate,

27:32.240 --> 27:38.440
they will be mostly compassionate to people who are, say…

27:40.800 --> 27:44.760
in, say, Vietnam — not in the ashram.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.320
They are more worried about Vietnam people, you know:

27:47.560 --> 27:50.000
“Oh, Mother, we are worried about Vietnam people,

27:50.200 --> 27:51.800
we are collecting money for them,

27:52.040 --> 27:53.640
we are trying to send money to Vietnam.”

27:53.880 --> 27:57.280
And here among ashramites — fighting.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.720
This is not compassion by any chance.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.080
Sahaja Yogis among themselves are a different race,

28:05.280 --> 28:09.040
and they are to support each other all the time,

28:09.240 --> 28:10.160
and look after them.

28:10.400 --> 28:14.840
When I find Sahaja Yogis criticizing Sahaja Yogis, I’m amazed.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.760
I’m really amazed.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.080
Because you are part and parcel of the same.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.400
How can you criticize? One eye criticizing another person —

28:23.600 --> 28:26.840
I just can’t understand.

28:27.200 --> 28:31.160
I can criticize, all right, but why should you?

28:31.440 --> 28:34.640
Why should you criticize each other?

28:34.960 --> 28:38.640
Only thing that you have to do is to love each other.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.040
Christ has said it thrice,

28:40.240 --> 28:43.240
I must have said it a hundred and eight times already —

28:43.520 --> 28:46.520
that you have to love each other.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.320
That is the only way you are expressing compassion.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.840
If I’ve given you any love any time,

28:52.120 --> 28:56.080
you have to have patience with others, love for others.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.840
I sometimes try to coax people,

28:59.080 --> 29:03.840
and I find that people immediately come out

29:04.080 --> 29:08.280
with some sort of a criticism of others, or something like that.

29:09.880 --> 29:15.880
Now, the basic thing is that our compassion,

29:16.560 --> 29:21.960
if that is flowing,

29:22.280 --> 29:26.040
then only we can get compassion from Mother.

29:27.720 --> 29:32.480
There is no place any more; I’ve done too much compassion business.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.880
And what I find that now unless and until you flow it,

29:35.080 --> 29:39.080
how am I to give you compassion? I mean, there is no space left now.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.680
So better give it away, empty yourself a little bit,

29:41.880 --> 29:45.120
then I can give you more compassion.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.720
It’s simple business.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.480
In this respect, one has to understand

29:53.680 --> 29:57.880
that the source cannot flow

29:58.120 --> 30:02.960
unless and until it expands the flow of it.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.400
Like the river Thames. We went to see the river Thames,

30:06.600 --> 30:08.720
the place from where it starts.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
It’s a small, little stream from seven streams —

30:11.120 --> 30:15.080
little little, very little little — we can say, trickling down.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.200
And it has become a river Thames.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.840
Supposing it does not widens —

30:21.120 --> 30:24.320
that will stop at the beginning only.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.640
It cannot come out, it cannot flow.

30:27.840 --> 30:31.680
It’s not because it is angry, or upset, or anything like that,

30:31.880 --> 30:35.520
but by the nature of its flow only

30:35.720 --> 30:38.800
it cannot flow, what to do?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.880
So, that is what it is —

30:44.120 --> 30:48.320
that one has to give compassion to others.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.000
It should not be formal compassion, or affected one,

30:52.200 --> 30:55.440
but should be a natural one, very natural,

30:55.720 --> 30:58.160
spontaneous, feeling from within.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.120
It’s not an expression of your ego,

31:00.320 --> 31:02.840
or superego, or over-sentimentality,

31:03.120 --> 31:06.560
but is a kind of a understanding that he is a Sahaja Yogi,

31:06.760 --> 31:09.000
you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are brothers.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.240
Not the way the brothers have been

31:11.520 --> 31:16.240
but a different type of brothers who are spiritual brothers.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.680
You are spiritual people.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.800
So this compassion has to be there,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.960
and unless and until you develop that compassionate,

31:25.160 --> 31:29.120
fatherly or motherly feelings for others…

31:29.360 --> 31:30.920
I mean, I am a Mother of a person

31:31.120 --> 31:34.560
who is about hundred and eight years of age.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.080
You have to really mother others,

31:37.360 --> 31:41.160
and have that feeling of compassion and love for others.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.360
You don’t have to think about your own comfort,

31:43.600 --> 31:46.240
you don’t have to think about your own advantages,

31:46.440 --> 31:48.880
but you have to think about the comfort of others.

31:49.080 --> 31:53.200
You have to think what you can do to make others comfortable,

31:53.440 --> 31:57.600
than to see what will make you comfortable.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.640
So this flow of compassion, when it starts, you see,

32:02.840 --> 32:06.200
the dedication is complete.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.760
Because “whatever we got from You, Mother,

32:10.000 --> 32:13.240
we are giving it to others.” That’s the dedication.

32:13.520 --> 32:19.400
So the flow of dedication is not one-sided.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.960
It is double-sided.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.800
You stick on to something,

32:24.000 --> 32:27.400
you get connected with something to get something out of it,

32:27.640 --> 32:29.840
and you give it to others.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.800
And ultimately that reaches the collective being —

32:33.000 --> 32:36.600
means it reaches the source.

32:38.240 --> 32:41.440
It is in this light we have to understand.

32:41.640 --> 32:44.640
Exclusiveness, or “We should — now married —

32:44.880 --> 32:46.520
we should have separate place,

32:46.760 --> 32:48.520
we should live separately” — it’s all right,

32:48.760 --> 32:51.000
you must have little privacy as a married people,

32:51.200 --> 32:53.560
I’m not saying that.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.600
But as far as compassion is concerned,

32:56.800 --> 32:59.920
as married people you have to be much more compassionate.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.560
But you’ll only worry about your own children,

33:03.760 --> 33:06.160
about your own comfort,

33:06.400 --> 33:10.000
about your own husband, about your own wife.

33:10.240 --> 33:15.040
In Sahaja Yoga, there is no place for such people.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.520
It’s all collective.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.520
When you bring sweets for your own child,

33:20.760 --> 33:23.360
bring for other children in the ashram.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.000
You are one family,

33:25.240 --> 33:28.400
and all the family has to move with the same waves.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.520
I had told you before

33:29.720 --> 33:31.960
that we cannot have separate food arrangements,

33:32.240 --> 33:34.120
separate this and separate that.

33:34.320 --> 33:38.520
In the same way, we cannot have separate standards

33:38.720 --> 33:42.040
of living for different people.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.800
We all have to enjoy whatever is enjoyed by all of you.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.040
That should be so.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.080
And that should be achieved on material level.

33:52.280 --> 33:56.760
On emotional level, any marriage which is absurd,

33:56.960 --> 33:59.920
which makes everyone unhappy is useless.

34:00.160 --> 34:04.720
But marriages are made to make everyone happy.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.760
So, before you decide to marry,

34:07.000 --> 34:11.040
think that you are not playing tricks.

34:11.280 --> 34:15.720
Playing tricks in Sahaja Yoga is very, very dangerous.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.640
You are not playing tricks with your marriages;

34:18.880 --> 34:20.840
you are not trying to involve somebody else,

34:21.040 --> 34:22.880
thinking that Mother will forgive you and all that.

34:23.080 --> 34:27.120
I will forgive. But your ascent is difficult.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.640
So don’t try to play tricks with anything

34:30.880 --> 34:32.720
that you have been doing before,

34:32.920 --> 34:37.320
but change yourself completely, transform yourself completely.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.960
Now you change your attitude towards life.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.080
You can because it is changed already.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.880
If you try to be the other person, you cannot be.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.440
Now you have become a flower, now you can’t become

34:48.720 --> 34:50.480
suddenly the leaf.

34:50.680 --> 34:55.120
Now you are a flower, and you have to live like a flower.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.240
And that’s what you have to remember —

34:57.520 --> 35:03.240
that compassion is such an outflow,

35:03.440 --> 35:07.560
is such a natural thing for a Sahaja Yogi.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.040
It’s not natural for anybody else.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.080
Other people who talk of compassion, or this and that,

35:13.280 --> 35:16.160
are actually… are not at all compassionate.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.080
They are doing it for money; they are doing it for position;

35:19.280 --> 35:20.960
they are doing for ego satisfaction.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.000
But you are having compassion

35:23.240 --> 35:26.000
because you have to have it, jolly well.

35:26.280 --> 35:30.680
It is flowing, the compassion — because it has to flow.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.560
And you are doing compassion because of compassion.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.280
There is no other purpose behind it.

35:38.520 --> 35:42.040
Only this will give you something

35:42.280 --> 35:45.600
that is of permanent nature, of a sthayi nature.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.960
I’ve seen people — as I was telling in the morning —

35:49.280 --> 35:50.760
who have gone to an organization,

35:50.960 --> 35:52.960
made a beautiful organization out of it,

35:53.160 --> 35:55.280
and once they leave, the organization is finished.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.840
Because they do not give anything substantial to that organization.

35:59.080 --> 36:03.480
And what is to be given is a large heart of compassion.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.920
If you do not give that,

36:05.160 --> 36:09.360
once you go away from that, the rest of them are again barren.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.920
It’s not a growth.

36:11.160 --> 36:14.520
Like if you bring water, and plant things,

36:14.720 --> 36:20.320
and give water to that area, then it becomes very beautiful,

36:20.520 --> 36:25.080
and you can say it’s a very lush growth.

36:25.320 --> 36:31.360
But as soon as that water source is removed,

36:31.680 --> 36:33.600
it gets again dried out.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.520
But Sahaja Yoga is different.

36:35.760 --> 36:40.680
In Sahaja Yoga you not only grow as a plant

36:40.880 --> 36:45.000
but also as the source of the plant.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.760
If this plant is removed from here, put somewhere,

36:48.960 --> 36:51.120
it will give water to other plants.

36:51.400 --> 36:54.320
Do you know this new dimension that you have within yourself?

36:54.560 --> 36:58.520
That once this plant is uprooted from here and taken out,

36:58.720 --> 37:01.200
it will not die, not at all. It will grow.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.000
But it will make others grow.

37:04.240 --> 37:08.760
This is another type of a growth that we have.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.040
And it’s a very different position we are in.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.200
And that’s what now I want — that all of you,

37:15.400 --> 37:20.240
even if you are uprooted and put into any other place…

37:20.480 --> 37:21.960
I’ve seen, when I ask people

37:22.160 --> 37:24.040
that “You better shift from here to there,”

37:24.240 --> 37:27.200
they just get frightened.

37:27.480 --> 37:31.840
“You better go there and do this” — they get frightened.

37:32.080 --> 37:36.440
You are a plant which can not only go and prosper in any place

37:36.640 --> 37:40.120
but you will give

37:40.400 --> 37:43.000
the necessary nourishment to other plants.

37:43.240 --> 37:46.200
That’s what you are.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.640
So do not stick on to one place. If you stick on, then

37:49.840 --> 37:51.960
think there must be something wrong with the place.

37:52.160 --> 37:56.360
Like a glue if you are sticking to one place, it’s very dangerous.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.240
And be sure that you must turn

37:59.480 --> 38:01.160
away from such a place which glues you.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.200
That does not mean that, as people are here,

38:03.400 --> 38:05.520
they never stay in the house, they all the time running out.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.840
It doesn’t mean. Again I have to strike that point.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.920
Because otherwise the people are here…

38:10.160 --> 38:12.080
are all the time running away from their houses.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.520
That’s not the point.

38:13.760 --> 38:17.080
The point is that you should not be glued to anything

38:17.360 --> 38:19.600
and not afraid of leaving any place,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.880
because now you are Sahaja Yogis.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.760
You have joined the ocean, and ocean can take you anywhere.

38:26.080 --> 38:29.000
So just prepare yourself to move into any place

38:29.240 --> 38:35.160
because you have to take this compassion everywhere.

38:35.680 --> 38:40.720
And to prosper the Kingdom of God,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.480
you have to serve Him.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.720
And this service only possible if you know

38:46.920 --> 38:52.600
that you are here for a very great, universal task.

38:52.840 --> 38:58.640
Not only for England, for India, or for America,

38:58.840 --> 39:01.200
but you are here for a global task,

39:01.400 --> 39:03.840
which is the epitome of our evolution.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.440
This is the highest thing we have to do

39:06.640 --> 39:09.760
for our Creation and for our Creator,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.600
and you are chosen for that.

39:12.840 --> 39:16.000
So don’t divert your attention to anything

39:16.280 --> 39:22.200
that is not fulfilling your own manifestation.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.440
Discard all that. Don’t waste your energy.

39:25.680 --> 39:31.600
And your manifestation is your compassion, your love.

39:33.760 --> 39:37.040
But still, it should not remain rational.

39:37.240 --> 39:42.200
Whatever I have said to you is just to put you into a condition

39:42.440 --> 39:44.720
where you start sucking the vibrations

39:44.920 --> 39:47.360
as well as giving the vibrations.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.200
It is an action,

39:49.440 --> 39:53.240
which is a happening that should take place within you.

39:53.480 --> 39:56.240
It’s not rationality, it’s not thinking about it.

39:56.480 --> 39:59.680
Only by saying these things I really stun your thinking.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.200
You should allow this to happen to you.

40:02.400 --> 40:09.400
Just with the vibratory awareness you should judge yourself:

40:09.640 --> 40:12.720
“Am I the one who is giving vibrations to others?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Am I the one who has stored these vibrations,

40:15.200 --> 40:18.480
or am I getting ruined?”

40:19.560 --> 40:22.680
All this will give you a great meaning —

40:22.880 --> 40:27.520
and an employment. As I said, “employed by God.”

40:28.200 --> 40:31.480
If you have any questions, ask Me.

40:48.480 --> 40:52.280
YOGI: Mother, if you become angry at any point with people,

40:52.520 --> 40:54.560
is that because it’s a tendency

40:54.760 --> 40:56.960
or a negative entity?

40:57.280 --> 41:00.800
Or is it just a tendency to react like that?

41:01.200 --> 41:05.800
SHRI MATAJI: You see, if you get angry within yourself,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.280
and if you are sure that you are not doing anything wrong,

41:09.560 --> 41:12.840
for a Sahaja Yogi there is no need to say outside you are angry.

41:13.080 --> 41:17.240
There’s no need. That anger itself is a power.

41:17.480 --> 41:22.360
And you should do your bandhan and anything that you want to do.

41:22.960 --> 41:27.920
But you should not show that you are angry.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.640
You should be absolutely silent. Because you can be;

41:30.840 --> 41:33.160
you are in the axis, you are not on the periphery.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.680
Actually, the anger is just to see your anger

41:35.880 --> 41:39.400
and use that anger for that purpose.

41:40.280 --> 41:47.880
And once you start doing that, that anger will itself work out.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.680
That anger will itself work out the person.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.920
And you’ll be amazed how it… but you must learn to see your anger

41:55.120 --> 41:56.800
that is working.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.840
All these things are important. You have seen that sometimes

42:00.080 --> 42:02.680
only shouting at the bhoots — they go away.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.960
And many mad people have been cured like that.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.640
But you don’t do all that, that’s for Me.

42:07.880 --> 42:12.080
You must be always decent, with decorum and all that.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.040
But if the anger is because of your nature,

42:15.240 --> 42:18.800
or a tendency, or out of control — than it’s a bad thing.

42:19.040 --> 42:22.440
If it is an out-of-control, than it’s a bad thing.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.880
If you get into a temper because it is out of control,

42:26.080 --> 42:28.880
than it’s a bad thing. I can get very angry,

42:29.120 --> 42:31.800
but I am completely under control: I know I am angry,

42:32.000 --> 42:35.720
where the bhoot is, how he is running away; I can see it.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.120
But you can’t see the bhoot, you can’t see anything.

42:39.400 --> 42:43.680
So there is no need for you to get angry, show temper.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.720
But if you have an anger —

42:46.960 --> 42:50.000
say, for example, which makes you uncontrollable —

42:50.280 --> 42:53.720
then there is a mantra for that: Shanti [peace].

42:53.920 --> 42:58.080
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.”

42:58.320 --> 43:01.000
You must ask for that bliss, for that peace.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.960
This is a mantra for you.

43:03.160 --> 43:06.560
For controlling your temper, you have to tell yourself,

43:06.760 --> 43:10.920
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.”

43:11.200 --> 43:14.600
So Shanti is the point — the axis point is that —

43:14.800 --> 43:16.720
from where you witness everything.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.000
You are in Shanti, you are in complete…

43:19.240 --> 43:21.840
you are not in a turmoil even if you are angry.

43:22.120 --> 43:25.040
You are not in a turmoil. Whatever is anger is the power,

43:25.320 --> 43:27.560
and the power is taking charge.

43:27.760 --> 43:31.840
But unless and until that is achieved, what you have to do is to put

43:32.040 --> 43:34.480
yourself in a position that you are peaceful.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.840
So I think that’s a very good mantra —

43:37.080 --> 43:42.240
is to say, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.”

43:42.520 --> 43:44.880
Can you say that?

43:58.760 --> 44:01.480
So the Shanti is your fort.

44:01.720 --> 44:04.720
But peacefulness never means cowardice.

44:04.960 --> 44:08.800
Never call cowardice as peace.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.080
A person who is peaceful is never coward,

44:11.320 --> 44:14.920
because nothing can transgress it, nothing can overpower it.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.280
It is never never

44:17.480 --> 44:21.520
possible that cowardice and peace can go together.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.480
But your power is inside, not outside.

44:24.680 --> 44:27.920
So you don’t show your power of your anger outside.

44:28.160 --> 44:34.080
But just little anger with anybody — you will see it will work out.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.600
But first establish that…

44:39.840 --> 44:42.600
that position within you where you are the axis,

44:42.800 --> 44:46.840
where you do not allow anger to sit on your head.

44:47.120 --> 44:52.320
That is the growth. That is the growth, that you are at peace.

44:52.960 --> 44:57.680
Also… Another question? All right, satisfied now?

44:57.880 --> 44:59.160
Both ways you should know:

44:59.360 --> 45:03.680
that one is the anger that is detached — is perfectly all right;

45:03.880 --> 45:07.000
anger which involves you — work it out.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.440
So judge yourself as to what it is.

45:10.640 --> 45:13.640
Good question.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.480
Ask some questions.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.320
I mean, such intellectuals sitting here.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.880
Ask Me some questions what is there.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.800
YOGI: Mother, [HAVE YOU PREPARED?] Your plans

45:40.000 --> 45:43.320
to spread Sahaja Yoga [IN OUTER SCALE?]?

45:43.560 --> 45:45.320
SHRI MATAJI: What are My plans?

45:45.600 --> 45:49.120
I don’t plan. You see, I don’t plan, because I don’t know

45:49.360 --> 45:54.360
how far My instruments are ready, you see.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.800
First, now My only plans — if I have any —

45:57.000 --> 45:59.680
is to really prepare My weapons all right.

45:59.880 --> 46:03.080
Once they are done, then we’ll fix them up.

46:03.320 --> 46:06.920
You see, unless and until you know how far your bomb can fall,

46:07.160 --> 46:10.080
how can you plan it?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.440
So, first of all, I must measure up

46:14.680 --> 46:18.360
the power of My children, how powerful they are.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.760
That’s what I’m trying to do now —

46:19.960 --> 46:23.520
is to make them aware of their powers to use.

46:23.720 --> 46:27.160
Like, you see, Hanumana, when He was born and when He grew up,

46:27.360 --> 46:31.200
He forgot that time, and He forgot His powers.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.640
So He was to be reminded

46:32.840 --> 46:34.960
that “You are such and such powerful person.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.360
You don’t know what your powers are, you…

46:37.600 --> 46:39.640
you ate of the whole of Surya.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.400
This you did in your childhood. You are born with this power,

46:42.640 --> 46:44.080
but now, after growing,

46:44.320 --> 46:48.120
you are… rather bit… sort of forgotten it,

46:48.360 --> 46:52.600
and also you were afraid of using them, and it’s…

46:53.480 --> 46:57.200
sort of looks like in the dominant position.

46:57.400 --> 47:01.480
But it is there. If you just try to remember them, it will come up.”

47:01.680 --> 47:04.480
They have tremendous power, these people have tremendous power.

47:04.680 --> 47:07.200
But they have to assume and stand on that.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.720
If they do not do it…

47:08.920 --> 47:11.920
You see, if I tell them, “Now, go to this house” —

47:12.120 --> 47:15.680
“Oh, Mother, there may be a bhoot there sitting.”

47:21.080 --> 47:23.040
A person comes possessed in the ashram —

47:23.240 --> 47:26.960
they all shut their doors: “Oh God, this bhoot has come.”

47:27.240 --> 47:30.160
Or something — then worse.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.720
YOGI: Mother, may I ask You something?

47:39.040 --> 47:42.320
How can we deal with… You see, there is one problem in…

47:42.560 --> 47:44.680
one big problem in Sahaja Yoga, You know.

47:45.080 --> 47:49.280
It’s… those who are devoted to You at the expense of others.

47:49.560 --> 47:50.920
SHRI MATAJI: Those who are devoted to Me…

47:51.120 --> 47:56.360
YOGI: Or those who use the excuse of their devoting to You, Mother,

47:56.600 --> 47:58.280
sometimes to oppress others.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.320
SHRI MATAJI: They are what?

47:59.560 --> 48:04.000
YOGI: Sometimes people use their devotion to You

48:04.200 --> 48:09.000
as… at the expense of others, or…

48:09.200 --> 48:12.320
SHRI MATAJI:Then again the same thing, Djamel, is the same thing is.

48:12.520 --> 48:16.760
You see, it is… you have to do it, all those who are doing that way.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.360
I’m just pointing out to all those.

48:19.560 --> 48:24.320
If you are using, say, your devotion to Me

48:24.560 --> 48:27.440
for the oppressing of others, all right?

48:27.720 --> 48:30.440
So it is for you to see.

48:30.680 --> 48:32.600
There is nobody who can be oppressed,

48:32.800 --> 48:36.240
because your Spirit cannot be oppressed.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.360
Say, there is X and Y.

48:38.600 --> 48:43.520
Now, Y is a person who’s trying to oppress X, all right?

48:43.720 --> 48:48.160
What will you oppress? He can’t oppress his Spirit, can he?

48:48.440 --> 48:49.920
First point. Clear.

48:50.160 --> 48:54.480
Now, this fellow, if he has to have

48:55.320 --> 48:57.880
attachment to Me, nobody can stop him.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.880
There is all… you all have direct relationship with Me.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.280
Not through anyone.

49:02.520 --> 49:06.640
If you want to accept somebody’s agency, then I can’t help you.

49:06.840 --> 49:10.040
But, otherwise, you all have a direct access to Me.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.680
You all can grow your Spirits; nobody can dominate you.

49:13.880 --> 49:17.600
Everyone has complete freedom to grow their Spirit —

49:17.800 --> 49:19.440
to know their Spirit, I mean to say.

49:19.640 --> 49:24.480
And the Spirit is something… cannot be dominated by anyone.

49:24.720 --> 49:27.040
Now, supposing somebody tries to oppress you.

49:27.280 --> 49:28.760
What will they oppress you, in which way?

49:28.960 --> 49:30.480
They’ll say, “All right, we’ll not have this carpet,

49:30.720 --> 49:33.520
we’ll have that carpet.” Have it!

49:33.760 --> 49:38.720
Somebody will say, “I’ll jump in the sea.” Jump! Just now you jump!

49:39.560 --> 49:42.600
What will they oppress you in? You see, just see that.

49:42.800 --> 49:46.800
Not in your spiritual growth. Can they?

49:47.040 --> 49:49.120
And that’s how the problem starts.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.440
You see, in material things…

49:51.680 --> 49:53.600
say, in an ashram now somebody says,

49:53.800 --> 49:58.680
“All right, we would like to have a photograph of Mother put there.”

49:58.920 --> 50:01.560
The other will say, “No, we are going to have it there.”

50:01.800 --> 50:04.040
Whether you put it here or there makes no difference.

50:04.280 --> 50:07.480
My photograph is going to work it out.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.560
Even in puja matters I’ve seen:

50:11.760 --> 50:14.160
people will say that “No, Mother is sitting there,

50:14.360 --> 50:16.480
don’t put your feet towards the Mother.”

50:16.680 --> 50:18.920
It is common thing; everybody knows should not put it.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.680
But still they will say, “No, we want to put it.”

50:20.880 --> 50:22.360
All right, let them put it.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.920
Next time they will not, because they will know it is wrong.

50:26.200 --> 50:27.640
They will find out.

50:27.880 --> 50:31.520
So, you see, nobody can oppress anyone.

50:31.720 --> 50:34.880
I am here to correct. Once you understand

50:35.120 --> 50:37.920
that you are not perfect, the other is not perfect,

50:38.160 --> 50:40.920
we are all perfecting ourselves, we are all coming up,

50:41.160 --> 50:42.960
Mother is there to look after us —

50:43.240 --> 50:47.280
then we will never think like that.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.520
Now. I’ve also seen, people will say

50:50.720 --> 50:55.160
that there are two Sahaja Yogis talking to others… Sahaja Yogis.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.360
Now, one is a very oppressive one,

50:57.560 --> 51:01.680
the another one is upset to see that this one is oppressive.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.520
Now, for that purpose, if you are quiet, silent —

51:04.720 --> 51:06.200
you will always dominate him.

51:06.440 --> 51:08.640
People will listen to you, not to him.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.440
But even if you start saying,

51:10.680 --> 51:11.760
“Oh, you don’t say like that,” this, this,

51:11.960 --> 51:15.360
they will think these are fighting cocks.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.160
Then, at that time, you are wise at this thing —

51:18.360 --> 51:22.480
will even give him a chance to understand.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.560
But what happens: one person dominates,

51:24.760 --> 51:27.440
another tries to dominate them by outward things.

51:27.640 --> 51:30.120
And the whole show is over.

51:30.400 --> 51:34.040
There is no need to dominate another person by outward things.

51:34.280 --> 51:35.880
He will settle down by himself

51:36.080 --> 51:38.320
if you show your dignity of your silence

51:38.560 --> 51:42.280
and of your understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.080
There is no need just now to say,

51:44.280 --> 51:47.800
“Shut up, you sit down, you don’t do.” It’s absolutely wrong.

51:48.080 --> 51:52.800
They do it, I’ve seen it. In My presence I’ve seen it.

51:55.800 --> 51:59.240
Because we still live halfway there and halfway here.

51:59.520 --> 52:03.160
The way we solve the problem… say, you have to do some business.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.880
There are two people doing the business. One person says something,

52:06.120 --> 52:07.800
another says, “Why did you say like this, you shouldn’t say.”

52:08.000 --> 52:11.680
This person says to that person, “You shouldn’t correct me.”

52:11.880 --> 52:13.360
Like that the fight is on.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.800
But that doesn’t help anyway… there also.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.720
But in Sahaja Yoga it will never help.

52:17.920 --> 52:21.840
The another person can only win over by his dignity.

52:22.040 --> 52:25.520
By his quiet methods, by approaching a person properly.

52:25.720 --> 52:28.920
That’s how the leaders will come up.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.440
They won’t come up by shooting another person down,

52:32.680 --> 52:35.720
not at all by any chance. That’s not possible.

52:35.960 --> 52:37.440
Is not good leadership.

52:37.720 --> 52:44.440
Good leadership is judged the way you handle the situation,

52:44.680 --> 52:48.080
not the way you fight another man down.

52:48.560 --> 52:51.520
So many times you have seen: I just keep quiet — it works out.

52:51.760 --> 52:55.280
Not necessary that you should at that moment shout.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.600
There’s no need.

52:57.840 --> 53:02.760
And it creates a very bad impression and very bad leadership.

53:03.480 --> 53:07.960
First of all, you cannot be dominated. This is one fact, is a truth.

53:08.240 --> 53:10.640
You can grow in your spirituality,

53:10.840 --> 53:14.720
whatever people may try to dominate in the worldly things.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.640
Thank God we don’t have any organization.

53:16.840 --> 53:21.680
Thank God we don’t have secretaries, assistant secretaries,

53:21.880 --> 53:24.200
under-secretaries, by-secretaries,

53:24.440 --> 53:27.680
upper secretaries, lower secretaries — we don’t have any nonsense.

53:27.880 --> 53:30.680
Otherwise, even that would have been dominating to people.

53:30.880 --> 53:34.160
Then they would have fought that. So we don’t have that problem.

53:34.360 --> 53:35.680
We don’t have any money problem,

53:35.880 --> 53:39.080
because we don’t have all these nonsensical ideas.

53:39.360 --> 53:44.480
I’ve solved this problem by having no institutions, no positions.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.680
Everybody has position.

53:48.440 --> 53:52.320
But the greatest position is of your Spirit, which you establish.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.600
The attention is not there, is more ego-oriented.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.080
The whole stuff is ego-oriented.

53:57.280 --> 54:00.720
You can’t fight ego with ego, you cannot.

54:00.960 --> 54:05.640
You can only fight ego or superego with Spirit.

54:07.880 --> 54:11.360
How much do I dominate you?

54:12.440 --> 54:15.600
I absorb all your aggression also.

54:15.800 --> 54:19.040
And how much do I dominate you?

54:21.840 --> 54:24.880
If I have to correct you, I go forward and do it,

54:25.120 --> 54:30.000
and tell you that I’m correcting you, whether you like it or not.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.560
And you see the result, it’s all right.

54:32.760 --> 54:36.160
But if you have that capacity, do it.

54:36.480 --> 54:40.560
Then there is lacking in you, that you cannot do that way,

54:40.760 --> 54:46.640
so be prepared not to, at least, spoil the show of Sahaja Yoga.

54:46.840 --> 54:49.240
One person is talking too much? All right, the others will say,

54:49.480 --> 54:52.640
“He is good for nothing, but another one is a sensible one.”

54:52.880 --> 54:57.240
But if you both are fighting, then I don’t know.

54:58.280 --> 55:02.120
That’s… doesn’t show any wisdom or growth, isn’t it?

55:03.200 --> 55:06.200
Does it?

55:12.440 --> 55:15.320
Those who think that by dominating in small small things

55:15.520 --> 55:19.520
you are going to achieve anything are wrong.

55:20.760 --> 55:23.840
Actually, I’ve seen, My grandchildren are realized souls.

55:24.080 --> 55:27.480
They are not bothered about these things, they don’t do this.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.680
This kind of a fight they don’t have.

55:29.880 --> 55:33.800
That “where to keep this”, “what to do this” — they don’t have.

55:34.040 --> 55:37.000
Nothing.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.120
At the most, they might fight for a chocolate

55:41.320 --> 55:43.080
or something, at the most.

55:43.280 --> 55:46.800
But in spiritual matters, they never fight.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.920
In spiritual matters they never fight.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.880
That’s a place one should not fight,

55:54.080 --> 55:56.240
one should not argue. That’s the point not to be argued,

55:56.440 --> 55:59.320
because truth is one. What is there to argue?

55:59.560 --> 56:01.760
You have seen all these saints, you see,

56:02.000 --> 56:03.840
those who have talked about Me. What do they say?

56:04.080 --> 56:06.720
Everybody says the same thing about Me.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
There cannot be any fight between saints, can there be?

56:10.240 --> 56:12.560
If the truth is one, how can there be fight?

56:12.760 --> 56:15.880
But because one is inadequate, another is dominating —

56:16.120 --> 56:19.760
both must achieve that state.

56:20.840 --> 56:24.040
But the best is to be more dignified,

56:24.280 --> 56:26.360
more grown-up, more patronizing…

56:26.560 --> 56:28.040
People will definitely take to you

56:28.240 --> 56:31.440
because you will become the leader.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.040
Arguments are not going to lead you anywhere,

56:41.240 --> 56:42.920
I can tell you this much.

56:43.160 --> 56:46.440
No use arguing among yourself.

56:47.880 --> 56:51.440
If you have to argue, you have to argue with others,

56:51.640 --> 56:54.640
not among yourself.

56:56.120 --> 56:59.960
Otherwise now? What else?

57:26.600 --> 57:32.120
What is the thing? Any other question?

57:35.920 --> 57:40.000
YOGINI: Mother, would You please tell a little bit how…

57:40.200 --> 57:43.040
how we fight our ego with the Spirit?

57:43.240 --> 57:44.840
How would you do…

57:45.080 --> 57:46.760
SHRI MATAJI: How do we fight the ego…

57:46.960 --> 57:48.040
YOGINI: … ego with the Spirit.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.240
SHRI MATAJI: You see, you should never fight ego.

57:50.480 --> 57:54.160
If you try to fight, it will sit more on your head.

57:54.440 --> 57:55.760
That’s not the way to fight it,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
that there is ego and you fight your ego:

57:58.200 --> 58:00.920
“Oh, I’m going to box you” — then it will grow more, you see.

58:01.160 --> 58:04.680
The more you box it, the more it will grow. Never fight your ego.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.200
Only way is to see it.

58:09.400 --> 58:12.440
Your attention is very important, your attention is now enlightened.

58:12.640 --> 58:16.360
Whatever you see, it comes to its right size.

58:16.600 --> 58:19.880
It comes to its right side… size.

58:20.120 --> 58:23.880
Say, ego — if it is overgrown, you just watch your ego.

58:24.160 --> 58:26.560
That is, it is to watch yourself in the mirror,

58:26.800 --> 58:30.760
and you say, “Oh, Mr. Ego, how do you do?”

58:33.640 --> 58:40.800
Then it will come down. But don’t fight it. Just to be seen.

58:41.040 --> 58:42.840
All kinds of egos could be there.

58:43.040 --> 58:46.520
If you are overeducated, you are egoistical.

58:46.720 --> 58:48.880
If you are uneducated, you are egoistical —

58:49.080 --> 58:51.480
because you must try to show that you are something.

58:51.680 --> 58:53.800
All sorts of egos are there.

58:54.040 --> 58:55.560
So best thing is to see for yourself;

58:55.760 --> 59:00.400
that’s why I say, “Face yourself.” “Yourself” means your Spirit.

59:06.880 --> 59:10.000
YOGI: Mother, that goes the same for the superego?

59:10.200 --> 59:11.680
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, very much so.

59:11.880 --> 59:14.000
For superego also — not to be frightened.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.600
You should just say, “Get out!

59:15.800 --> 59:18.080
I can see you very clearly, you are there.

59:18.320 --> 59:21.520
You get out from here! How dare you frighten me? I am the Spirit.

59:21.760 --> 59:25.640
I am the Spirit, how dare you can do that?”

59:25.880 --> 59:29.040
That’s how.

59:31.840 --> 59:34.880
You see, ego makes you idiotic. Absolutely.

59:35.080 --> 59:39.480
Ego makes you idiotic, makes an idiot out of you, absolutely.

59:39.720 --> 59:44.240
And the superego makes you a coward.

59:45.440 --> 59:48.520
It makes you a coward. Now, how to fight it?

59:48.720 --> 59:52.760
“I’m not going to be an idiot” — if you say that, ego will go away.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.040
If you want to be an idiot, then he’ll be there to help you.

59:56.240 --> 59:58.760
If you want to be an idiot, all right, call Mr. Ego.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.720
You’ll become an idiot, straightforward.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.360
Is the easiest way. Easiest way.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.120
If you want to become an idiot, simple thing is to call the ego.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.760
“You come, Mr. Ego, and settle down in me” —

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.200
and immediately… this is a very simple composition.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.680
And superego… if you are a coward, then it sits on your head.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.080
Say, “I am not going to be…”

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.640
Ham Ksham, as I told you, the mantra on the Agnya is.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.720
Either you have to say, “I am”;

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.360
the other, I say, “I forgive you.”

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.600
YOGI: Mother, may I ask you a question

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.560
similar to what he said about superego?

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.760
I’ll be particular.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:49.520
I’m still having problems with my eating.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.120
I’m eating a lot here

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.720
but I’m very afraid (I’m laughing ’cause it is silly)

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.040
that I’ll become fat.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.840
And I’m very afraid; I think a lot about food, all the time. Yet I…

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.080
… I know that with You nothing bad can happen to me.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.960
SHRI MATAJI: All right, you do one thing just now.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.840
You put your left hand towards Me and right hand outside.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.920
She has a Hamsa here, [UNCLEAR].

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.200
There. You see, the Hamsa.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.440
Tell her to come down. Come in, come in.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.400
Oh, I see. Sorry.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.800
Put the Hamsa, I didn’t see it clearly.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.520
Hello. [PHRASE IN HINDI]

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.960
[WE’VE BEEN?] waiting for you.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.920
Come forward, you can come forward a little bit.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.480
Lots of people are there.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.680
[PHRASE IN HINDI]

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.640
What’s the time now?

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.800
YOGI: A quarter past nine.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
SHRI MATAJI: Quarter past nine.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.840
As I have told you,

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.280
that relationship with yourself should be tyrannical.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.160
You should lash it down.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.720
You should absolutely make it clear to yourself

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.640
that “I have to perfect myself if I have to give

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.000
this my being to God. It has to be perfect.”

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.080
Secondly, if you have to have relationship

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.720
with others, it has to be ideal relationship.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.000
Sahaja Yogi with Sahaja Yogi — means something great.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.200
The greatest relationship is that.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.920
With your sister, with your brother — it should be ideal.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.400
And in collectivity we have to be pragmatic.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.160
In collectivity we can change our course,

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.120
we’ll take the way we like, the way it moves; we’ll manage it.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.000
But otherwise…

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.760
You see, for example, take a plane. It has the same thing.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.440
Plane, when it is in the air, it can go wherever it likes.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.520
But the screws that are fixed in a plane are ideally fixed.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.440
They cannot just start… like a pilot seat doesn’t go to the back,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.280
and the back doesn’t come to the front, you see.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.800
The relationship is maintained. All right?

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.040
And the screws which are made,

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.800
or anything that is made — is perfect.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.640
But airplane is not fixed.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.520
Airplane can go southward, northward… anywhere it wants to.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.240
Only the things that are in it

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.760
are correlated with each other in such proportion

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.760
that they cannot budge from their ideal positions.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.160
I’m giving this example because you are here.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.960
You’ll understand it better now.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.840
And these things that you have produced

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.040
are themselves… are perfect.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.320
If they are imperfect, there will be a problem.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.360
It’s like that. If you understand

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.840
this very simple thing about relations and attitudes,

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.000
you will never have problems.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.120
Your relationship with a Sahaja Yogi

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.080
has to be absolutely ideal relationship.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.360
Otherwise, some screw is loose.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.080
Try to make it ideal. Say, there’s one person.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.360
You find the person is too egoistical, or something.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.440
Try to see what’s wrong with you, first of all:

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.520
“Am I perfect? Am I all right?

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.880
Or am I equally dominating, am I equally egoistical?

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.880
All right, if I am, then I better correct myself.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.320
But if I am not,

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.240
if I am a good person, that way I’m not dominating —

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.560
then I should try to bring down his ego

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.880
by making sweet things to him, making nice relationship with him.”

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.840
Try to be kind to him, so that his ego comes down.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.760
Manage somehow or other to establish ideal relationship.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.360
Is absolutely simple. I mean, I don’t understand

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.960
what have I to tell in this thing. You know everything.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.520
That it has to be proper.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.560
Now see, the relationship between that and

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.000
Me has to be proper, so that it doesn’t burn Me, isn’t it?

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.280
It’s absolutely… in lifetime, also, we have to do the same thing —

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:23.200
that relationship with each other has to be ideal

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.600
to create the best results.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.400
It is so practical;

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.200
I don’t know what is there to tell in this thing.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.880
And you have to be perfect because you are the unit.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.680
And the whole thing can be pragmatic.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.360
Then only it can be.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.080
But here just the other way round. The screws are pragmatic,

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.360
the relationship is imperfect,

01:05:54.120 --> 01:06:00.040
and the collectivity is absolutely static. Doesn’t move.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.200
“The collectivity. After all, we are collective,

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.080
bound to each other.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.000
How can we move, Mother, we are static now.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.000
We are bound to each other, we can’t move, you see.”

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.800
Just like the Rock of Gibraltar.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.960
Now, you’ve been an aeronautic engineer, you should understand this

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:29.000
better than anybody else, this example.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.760
What else is the question?

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:43.840
How are you? All right? I’m asking.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.640
What other question?

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.000
YOGI: Shri Mataji, could You say something about

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.160
maintaining our attention, so that it stays where it should

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:02.800
and doesn’t get diverted into trivial things?

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.680
SHRI MATAJI: Rustem has asked a very practical question,

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:12.160
it’s true — that to keep the attention where it should be.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.560
You see, for everything

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:18.120
you have to do some exercise, abhyas.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.320
Not before Realization — after Realization.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.920
The best way is to learn how to watch yourself.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.520
Just now sitting here, just put yourself into a position

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.240
from where you watch yourself: “Now what am I doing?”

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.920
This is the abhyas, this is the study.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.000
Apart from mantras, apart from anything.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.880
The abhyas is the practice, practice of becoming a witness.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.200
And the witness is the Spirit state; then attention will not go.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.240
I mean, you will see everything, it’s there,

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.560
but attention will be inside.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.320
Try to practice this: “Am I a witness?”

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.360
Now, say, some people say, “Oh God, I had a horrible time.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.320
Mother, this happened, that happened.”

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.160
You see, you are not a witness.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.120
How can you have a horrible time if you are the Spirit?

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.440
You only have a horrible time when you are not the Spirit.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.640
If you can watch the whole thing as a drama that is played,

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.640
then you are not having a horrible time,

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.920
but this outside of you is having horrible time,

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.560
which you are watching.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.880
That’s how the attention can be fixed very well

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.600
if you practice abhyas,

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.040
practice all the time to be witness.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.520
Say, you go out, you see something.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.040
Just try to see it, not to think about it.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.560
Be a witness of the whole thing. The joy will be complete,

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.360
and, also, you will become absolutely peaceful.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.440
Your attention will be completely enlightened.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.200
And then the inspiration you will get will be tremendous.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.320
See, it’s working out. Working out. Try to watch.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.920
And it has such a tremendous memory — if you know how to watch.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.520
I mean, to Me, if I see something, I mean…

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.920
to Me it’s just like a… film in My mind.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.960
If I have seen this room now, I know what’s it in this, design —

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.440
everything I know. How you are sitting, what pose you have taken,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.800
how you wear, what was it — everything is like a design.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.680
You see, it comes to Me just like a picture. Absolutely.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.800
Not of this life but of lives!

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.360
Because that’s a recording system; that records best.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.960
If there are thoughts, it’s like something in between, you see.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.640
Now he is trying to record Me on the film,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.760
and if there’s something in between, moving, nothing will come in.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.640
But when there is nothing in between

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.360
and you are just seeing through,

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.280
you are recording everything that is important.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.840
Moreover, you’ll be amazed, you don’t record unimportant things.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.320
Like for people now…

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.040
they go to a village or any place;

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.960
they will be recording: “Oh God, it was very dirty,

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.680
and this happened, and we went there,

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.120
and there was cement to sleep,” for example, “we get…”

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.200
Or: “Then we went inside,

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.440
and there was no proper chair to sit down,

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.240
and the chair was so hard,

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.240
and my back started aching” — all these things they will remember.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.160
And then what happened? “Oh God, I couldn’t get Realization…”

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.600
Everything that bad.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.360
You see, it’s just like newspaper, all bad news.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.520
But to a person who is a realized soul in a real way…

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.000
he doesn’t see; I mean, you don’t smell anything dirty,

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.200
you always smell something good.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.120
You never smell, you do not think of anything dirty.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.040
Everywhere you go is beautiful.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.280
Even if you see just a sand, you see the pattern.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.440
Even if you see a barren hill.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.520
I saw some people who had gone;

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.960
I said, “Look at the beauty of these hills in Maharashtra.”

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.640
They said, “Mother, what is the beauty?

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.600
It’s not covered with trees.”

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.440
I said, “That’s the beauty, just see it, the patterns.”

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.720
They couldn’t see the patterns that I was seeing.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.240
But if you ask Me what is this hill, I also know that.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.520
Because I know the patterns of all the hills —

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.720
how it has moved, how it has made patterns and things like that.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.080
Because they don’t see that. You see, they cannot see the beauty,

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.440
because they are looking out for defects.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.520
Or, relatively, you see: “English trees are better

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.320
than, say, XYZ trees.”

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.600
So, then — “This is not better.” The relative… they start.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.160
But you are at absolute point,

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.000
you are getting the absolute of everything. Everything is your own.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.920
What is there to judge?

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.640
YOGI: Mother, perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:16.480
SHRI MATAJI: Eh?

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.920
YOGI: Perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.680
SHRI MATAJI: I am the Artist and I am the Art.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.960
But what about you? Who are you?

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.360
You are the… you are the one who is created,

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.000
and you can create, and you can become the artist.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.240
That’s what I’m saying — that you are not only the light

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.720
but the light that will give light to others.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.520
And, also, you will sustain that light which you have given light.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.640
This is the difference now between you and other people.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.160
Not that only you will be an artist

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.880
but you’ll enjoy the art of the Artist.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.360
This is what you have got.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.080
You don’t know, you are not aware of your powers.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.960
It’s a dynamic thing which has happened to you,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.440
which you should take to.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.360
But our attention is on from where the dirt is coming,

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.160
where the filth is coming, you know;

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.680
where the ugliness is there.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.160
If your attention is on ugliness…

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.440
People tell Me, “There was this [UNCLEAR].” I didn’t see,

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.840
I just saw the way the elephant was standing, you see;

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.040
the way he has pulled up his leg and he was raising his trunk.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.440
I never saw the dirt part of it. “Where was it?”

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.840
“At the back of it.” I say, “I never went on the back.”

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.000
If your attention is on… even description of a person.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.040
You ask a person, “How is he?”

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.040
“He’s a…”

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.280
All his… I mean, little funny points will come to your head.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.600
Even the photographers, I’ve seen.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.000
They will only take photograph when you are in a funny way, you see;

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.080
when your face is little turned round…

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.680
I mean, it’s a seeking after ugliness,

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.080
seeking after mistakes, seeking after something wrong.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.040
All the time if you do like this, you cannot be a happy person.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.720
All the time trying to find out defects,

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:06.960
and faults, and mistakes, and dirt, and ugliness.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.040
I mean, you are in for trouble. You’re asking for it.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.240
Like a person was saying there are three-four ditches in this place.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.160
I said, “Did you jump into one of them? Better jump in.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.320
So, once for all, you don’t see any other ditch.”

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.120
You don’t see the playing grounds,

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.880
you are just seeing the ditches. For what?!

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.200
The same thing can look ugly to a person

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.240
who is of that kind of an attitude,

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.680
who wants to see everything ugly.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.760
Try your attitudes. Try to see good in others.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.760
Try to see… not in… may not be… it…

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.480
I’m not saying for other people,

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.200
but I’m saying at least for Sahaja Yogis you can do it.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.880
Try to see good in them; what good they have done to Sahaja Yoga,

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.760
what you owe to them, how to get along with them.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.000
Why not see the good of them?

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.200
By giving them encouragement, by being good to them

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.680
you are helping Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.800
But you want to help your ego, because you are very “wise”.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.600
So, then only, when by appreciating another person only,

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:24.440
you have better relationship. This is a very simple fact.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.480
You see any film — there the two people are talking to each other

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.560
as if they are barking at each other.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:35.840
What does it take to be kind, to be gentle, to say pleasant things?

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.200
As soon as they will see a person — “Oh God!

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:45.520
You have become very ugly!” This is the best compliment.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.040
That’s human nature —

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.440
to see to the faults of others,

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.280
to see to the wrong things of others.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.720
You see, they will find out in anything.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.240
Somebody is very tidy — then that person is bad.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.480
Somebody is very untidy — that person is bad. Every sort of thing.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.520
But why not you do something about yourself,

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.880
that there’s something inside you which is not tidy?

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.440
And inside you that’s very upsetting.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.960
To Me it makes no difference, you have seen it.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.480
It makes no difference. If you say, I’ll sleep here.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.240
If you say, I’ll sleep on the… on the grass there.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.920
To Me makes no difference to what bathroom I go…

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.560
I don’t even remember all those things.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.640
What is there to remember in a bathroom, and this, and that?

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.720
All nonsense it is. I have no memory for all these things.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.200
Even if you want Me to know, I will not remember.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440
If you ask Me, “How did you go to that bathroom?” —

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.320
“Which one?” “That one.” I said, “It’s all right, I’ve been there.”

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.760
Then food. “What sort of a taste it was?”

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.320
and “What food it was?” and…

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.120
all sorts of things people go on thinking a lot.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.720
What’s the use? The whole food is going to just be digested

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.440
in the same stomach.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.640
What is there to be so much worried about all these things?

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.280
We are wasting our energy. I don’t waste My energy.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.760
I have no energy for wasting.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.520
In the same way, why do you waste your energy?

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.960
Why not see to the better side of man?

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.000
By seeing bad side, if you can cure it — well and good.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.280
But if you cannot cure it, you are going to get yourself bad.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.920
If you can cure it — nothing like it. But you can’t.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.960
Also once… always person say, “I would not do that.”

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.360
But you would do something else that the other person would not do.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.600
When judging others,

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.080
one has to know one should judge oneself first of all.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.120
Because with what are you judging? With your ego or superego.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.280
I’ve seen, it’s a very common failing,

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.120
which should not be there any more.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.000
Now you are realized souls, you are saints. And the saints…

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.760
though olden saints might be doing whatever they did — forget them.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.160
But you people are not going to see the faults of each other

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.880
but to the good points of everyone.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.360
Simple things I’ve seen:

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.880
somebody says a wrong English word, or a Sanskrit word,

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.800
or a wrong this — immediately you will catch on that.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.640
But he gives a big lecture — it’s all right. That nobody listens.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:28.560
Your mind is working: “What wrong thing he’s going to say?”

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.480
Attention should be onto what he said, it’s so beautiful.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.280
And then you will develop an attitude — as Mine is —

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:47.520
you’ll never see to the defects of the place. Never.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.280
Never. [UNCLEAR]. You will have no eyes to see.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.280
I mean, Mine is like that, condition is like that, I tell you.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.200
It will be like that. It’s very difficult.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.200
Like somebody says, “You come and play those cards with sticks” —

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.680
I never remember. I’ll always lose.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.120
So I said, “What’s the use of play it? I don’t remember.”

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.720
See, everybody says, “You have so many brains otherwise,

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.320
can’t you remember these three cards?”

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.360
I can’t, I can’t. It’s just My brain goes off.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.160
I put automa… I don’t know.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.680
I look like a stupid fool when I play that game.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.360
So why should I play?

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.360
Anything like that — I am absolutely good for nothing.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.800
So it’s a thing people know: “Oh, she is useless. Forget her.”

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.320
But it should become automatic with you also.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.200
Then it’s so enjoyable: how beautiful we are,

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.920
that everything is so beautiful around us to see.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.360
Such beauty exists and we do not see it!

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.160
Such tremendous joy! Every bliss is there flowing within us.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.280
And we don’t know, we don’t notice it. It’s such a happy thing.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.520
It’s such a beautiful thing.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.400
“Oh God, such a source of joy!” —

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.720
was just standing next to Me. I never knew.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:07.480
And just I turned round and saw that force. Turn round!

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.520
Turn your back to all conditionings of yours,

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.600
the ideas that you have…

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.080
Do not pass judgement, first thing is.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:23.080
Great art critics and all that, please, I beg of you,

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:29.200
that do not pass remarks at anything all the time.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.480
Is ego playing the trick.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:36.200
Just watch it, how it is making you feel

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.960
that you are something very great. Be careful.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.280
There were some people coming from America, have they come?

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.560
YOGINI: Steve and Christine, they called to say…

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.480
SHRI MATAJI: They haven’t come.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.440
YOGINI: They’re coming in one week. One more week they’re coming.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.800
SHRI MATAJI: So then we’ll decide, when they come here,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.040
what is to be done.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.040
Linda, for your problem, what is the thing to be done?

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.720
Will you get out of your personal problems or not?

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.880
YOGINI: Yes, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: No, I’m talking to Linda now.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.600
YOGINI: I’m… Which Linda?

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.120
[UNCLEAR].

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.560
SHRI MATAJI: I would suggest you should stay with your mother.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.120
She needs you. She’s an old woman, she needs you.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.560
You must serve her. There’s nothing wrong in it.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.840
YOGINI: Very possessive.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.280
SHRI MATAJI: No no no. You are inadequate,

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.920
not that she is inadequate.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.880
You have to serve her. Give her love, affection.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.240
She is lonely. She behaves like that because she is lonely.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.040
You are inadequate; I won’t say to her anything.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.080
She needs… she never had love, and you are the only child she has.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.880
You should love her. Give her more love, more affection.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.120
And, also, what she says about Peter, you should do that.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.520
Will give her consolation. She’s going crazy because of that.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.920
YOGINI: Trouble is, Mother, she said,

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.760
“It’s like ten years doing Sahaja Yoga.”

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.160
SHRI MATAJI: Let her say. Her saying nothing matters.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.760
You see, that’s not the thing, that’s just an escape.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.720
Because you are crazy, that’s why she thinks like that.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.160
YOGINI: I know that. I don’t blame, of course.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.880
SHRI MATAJI: But you should establish yourself

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.160
with more patience, with more love and affection.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.840
She’d say, “Do hundred times Sahaja Yoga.”

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.400
How much she’s changed her attitude —

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.360
because when you went there you went crazy.

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.040
And you are quite crazy sometimes, I’ve seen.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.040
First of all, you must be a tidy person,

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.280
neat person; must look after her.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.920
You must take up her responsibility of looking after.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.760
She’s an old woman, who has had no love all her life.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.560
What she wants is love,

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.360
and as a child, daughter, you must give her love.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.960
Whatever she is. You can’t leave her alone.

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.120
If you give her love, I’m sure you can cure her.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:04.320
You take up… it, take it up as a challenge.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.680
And give her a bandhan; everybody can give her a bandhan.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.640
And put her right. You cannot be helpless like that.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.720
To run away from your duties towards your mother,

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.800
I will never allow you.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.320
You can go to Cheltenham, start a centre there,

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.440
attend it, do it. You have to.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.880
YOGINI: Do you want me actually live with her?

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.520
YOGI: Should she live with her mother?

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.000
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, of course. Why not?

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.320
She is your own mother. She’s not such a cruel woman.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.880
I don’t think so. I have seen her.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.800
But you get crazy yourself, I know. I know that.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.920
This is how you will test yourself.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.960
You should live with her. After all, she’s so old now.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.480
What’s her age?

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.480
YOGINI: Sixty-four… sixty-three.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.280
SHRI MATAJI: See now. At sixty-three,

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:00.400
if she’s left alone in that house, what will she do?

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.680
You tell her that “I’ve decided

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.000
to do what you have told me about Peter…”

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.320
YOGINI: She hasn’t really tell me anything about Peter;

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.360
I’ve been doing most of the telling.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.400
SHRI MATAJI: All right, whatever it is. She’ll be all right.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.240
You see, you try to tell her these things —

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.720
she’ll be all right. You tell her.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.280
Just like this: “And now I’m going to look after you.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.040
You are very sick. You are not well.”

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:31.920
Take care. Did you talk to her kindly sometimes?

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.120
YOGINI: Well, I tried.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.520
SHRI MATAJI: No, you did not.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.800
You did not, that’s what it is.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.080
As a Sahaja Yogi, you have to be extremely kind

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.680
and compassionate towards her.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.840
She’s an old woman, had no love from her husband…

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.880
She has tried to do something for you always.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.440
So, as a daughter, you have a duty.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.920
YOGINI: I’m very worried about Bumble

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.240
because it’s a sort of 3-cornered arrangement which comes out.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.720
SHRI MATAJI: What happens about Bumble?

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.880
YOGINI: Well, Bumble sort of finishes up

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.280
in between me and her. It’s…

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.440
SHRI MATAJI: But if you finish off from yourself,

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.760
she won’t be finishing off like that.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.360
See, why do you create a problem between you and her, first of all?

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.560
There should be no gap.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.640
If there is no gap, then there won’t be any problem.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.360
The problem is because you are a problem and she is a problem,

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.720
so the child suffers.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.000
But if you just have nothing, you… if she tells…

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.200
on the contrary, if a child tells anything about your mother,

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.160
you should say, “Don’t say like that to my… she is my mother.”

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.000
Tomorrow she will turn back and tell you that, take it from Me.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:41.000
She is much more sensible in this than you are.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.080
You should not tell her anything about your mother.

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:47.160
You should say, “She has been very kind to me and nice to me.”

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.960
If it is communicated to her — if through Bumble —

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.880
things will be all right.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.480
See, how long is she going to live

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.280
with this kind of life she has had. All right?

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.840
Where are you going to try your Sahaja Yoga

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.160
if you can’t try on your own mother?

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.760
YOGINI: She wouldn’t have it.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.520
SHRI MATAJI: No, that’s not the way. It’s not outside, it is inside.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.560
YOGINI: I try to cook for her and she won’t eat what I cook.

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.000
SHRI MATAJI: You don’t have to do it outside,

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.080
you have to do it inside with her.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.360
Be kind, be gentle, be of service.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.440
At the most, she’ll shout sometimes, doesn’t matter.

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.680
Forgive her. Forgive her.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.720
YOGINI: She has vomiting, which really worries me.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:29.960
She doesn’t sleep at night.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.000
She wanders around talking to herself for whole time.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.160
SHRI MATAJI: You see, it’s all right,

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:38.680
if she doesn’t sleep, then you can say some mantras in your heart.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.040
You know there’s a mantra of Nidra and all that.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.520
You put her left to the right — she’ll sleep off.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:47.080
You do it, all that. She’ll sleep. You should say that “Breathe in,

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.840
three times, heavily. You’ll sleep off.”

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.160
And if you… when she’s talking also, if you sleep off,

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.520
she is not going to wake you up again.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.520
You just doze off there, and she’ll say,

01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.800
“All right, you go and sleep now,” formally.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.840
It’s very simple to fight out this thing.

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.240
I mean, she needs you very much. She can’t sleep, just imagine.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.080
Your mother can’t sleep, how can you run away from her?

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.360
Just see her condition. She is your mother.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.440
YOGINI: She is in a terrible state.

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.320
SHRI MATAJI: Then how can you leave her? You can’t.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.960
Can’t leave her. No, I wouldn’t say that.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.120
You can’t leave your mother.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.960
You know, Kathy wanted to come with Me. You remember Kathy?

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.720
YOGINI: Yes, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: When I told her,

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.640
“You can’t leave your mother in the hospital,

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.800
come with Me to India. No, you can’t.”

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.680
She missed that [THING?] completely.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.920
I told her, “You stay with your mother.” She is here. Just ask her.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.720
I did tell her.

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.800
And she was cancer, this thing, with the Sahaja Yoga and all that,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.520
and she used to attend to her. She stayed back.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.840
No, you can’t leave your parents like that, you see.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.440
Parents are very important things after certain age.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.960
You have to look after them.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.560
Whatever they are. You must look after your parents,

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.920
that’s very important in Sahaja Yoga.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.560
Your Right Heart cannot be all right, Shri Rama cannot be all right

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.760
if you don’t look after your mother.

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.120
She is not such a bad woman. I’ve seen her.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:20.120
And if she was a very cruel, horrible, this sort of thing,

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.880
then I would have said, “All right, forget her.”

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.120
But she is not that way. She is not either so much…

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.840
She is drinking because she has no company;

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.600
she doesn’t know what to do with herself.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.600
So she is trying to run away from herself.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.440
Is very simple to understand. You be kind and gentle.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.360
Give her some value, that she is something to you.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.600
She’ll be all right.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:46.080
I’ve seen, she is not a bad woman.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.280
Lot of her sense comes into you also, her goodness.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.880
YOGINI: I’m bothered, I think, by… when Grazyna came to stay,

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.800
she felt… Grazyna felt that…

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.680
she had this brother, you see, who [UNCLEAR]…

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.560
he killed himself [MOTOR-RACING?].

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.160
She saw him die in front of her.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.160
SHRI MATAJI: What’s it?

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.760
YOGINI: And she had this brother, my mother,

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.880
who she loved very much. And he…

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.480
SHRI MATAJI: That I’ve heard of already; that story I know.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.520
Whatever she has done, whatever it is.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:13.720
YOGINI: She seems very [UNCLEAR].

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.120
SHRI MATAJI: Doesn’t matter. But by leaving her,

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.600
are you going to help her by that?

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:19.160
You should fill the position of that brother.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.440
You should say, “Doesn’t matter. If the brother has died,

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.360
I am here to look after you, mother.”

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.080
Why is she hankering after the brother?

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.120
She thinks that if the brother had lived,

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.760
he would look after her in old age.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.120
But God knows if he had look after; he would run away too.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.440
Why can’t you fill the place of the brother? You can. Why not?

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.480
You take it up upon yourself. You can do it, I know.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:47.360
All right? You look upon her as you look upon Me.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:55.120
Why not? Just try. It is worth it. It’s worth it.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:02.800
Be nice and gentle. Say nice things, pleasant things to her.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Show interest in her life.

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.160
Actually, you see, all this has come from the psychologists also.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.880
Horrible ones.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.480
No, they always suggest their mother did something.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.520
Everybody I saw, they said, “My mother is like…”

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.600
I said, “How can everybody’s mother be so cruel?

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.960
Could be some people’s but not everybody’s.”

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.600
And, also, if they have deviated from right path,

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.680
it is because they never got their love.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.880
They never got their place in life.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.880
See, the husbands must have ill-treated them, tortured their lives,

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.520
and must have been after them; or maybe they had some other problems

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:42.880
from their parents, or something. Everybody’s mother has tortured…

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:48.680
It’s a psychology, I think. That way, mother is, in a way…

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.160
always if you look at her from a wrong angle,

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.520
she will look like your enemy.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.480
In the West, the mother picture is horrible.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.960
Also wars, things have come in that generation;

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:18.160
people have been shattered of their values.

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.320
All you must understand what kind of life

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:25.520
this horrible Western society can give to women who are good.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.080
Good women are really tortured in this society.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.920
Only the smart ones and the ones who are very arrogant

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.040
and who know how to put men right

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.440
and women right in their places can exist.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:39.440
You see, this is what it is. It’s a regular struggle here.

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.400
Any good woman is tortured in this society.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.760
I mean, if she exists and she really lives,

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:53.560
it’s something surprising. Ask, Maria will tell you. You ask her.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:56.520
How they put them down, how they insult them, how…

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:00.200
I mean, everybody has seen this happening here.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:05.360
But don’t blame the mother all the time.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.280
At this stage you must look after. So, now what is next?

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.480
YOGI: Sorry, could you marry me and my girlfriend

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.080
some time in future, do You think?

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.280
SHRI MATAJI: What’s it?

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:22.520
YOGI: Marry him and his girlfriend.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.280
SHRI MATAJI: Who is your girlfriend?

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.360
YOGI: She is not here tonight, she is in…

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.760
SHRI MATAJI: She is not a Sahaja Yogini?

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.960
YOGI: She’s come from Bedford. Yes, she is a Sahaja Yogini.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.960
SHRI MATAJI: She’s Sahaja Yogini.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.320
So you want to have a marriage on Krishnashtami?

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.320
Some of the marriage to be performed?

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.640
YOGI: [YES, PLEASE].

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.240
SHRI MATAJI: Now, when is the Krishnashtami?

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.480
YOGI: Next Sunday, Mother.

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:02.120
YOGI: Some time in the future, not…

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.120
SHRI MATAJI: You see, the best place to get married is in India.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.840
Very easy, and you have a real feeling

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.440
because you come on a horse, and this and that, you see.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.480
But even if you want to have in Krishnashtami day,

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.040
I don’t know if we can get really somebody to do it.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:24.360
If somebody we can get, we should do it.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.480
There are people who want to get married.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.960
But, you see, Sahaja Yoga marriage is taken for granted.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.960
I’ve seen, people do not have that understanding.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.960
And it’s very dangerous to play with it, very dangerous. See?

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.760
So, I think, if you have some time given to yourself,

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.520
I will definitely marry.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.960
Best thing is, I think, let people take some time

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.520
and decide, because…

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:49.960
you see, it’s very funny, nobody feels responsible about it.

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.280
They’ll come out with an explanation:

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.600
“Oh, I didn’t understand, and I was not in a position to do it;

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:02.080
I was still possessed with a bhoot. And I married another bhoot.”

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.080
YOGI: [UNCLEAR], I’ve lived with her for two years.

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.200
SHRI MATAJI: With her?

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.080
YOGI: Yes, with her.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.280
SHRI MATAJI: That is, you have given sufficient time now?

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.920
But, you see, one thing is:

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.680
their living in the West is simple… people.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.720
But if you tell them, “Marriage” — Oh God! They go… go amok.

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.520
They go amok. You see, if it’s a marriage — aah!

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.720
Ask David Prole, he’ll tell you.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:46.160
You see, because the law is so horrifyingly funny here,

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.080
marriage — Oh God, it means horrible things.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.800
You have to separate, you have to…

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.920
if you have to divorce… the first thing about divorce:

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.120
“You’ll have to give so much money”,

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.080
“Half money the wife will take away”, “She’ll murder me…”

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.280
You see, they show “husband murders wife,

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.120
wife murders husband” — all sorts of things, you know.

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.120
All the time it is like going on in this country —

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.440
is madness about marriage.

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.920
So, I think is a good idea.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.680
I would like — if you can arrange —

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.320
because Krishnashtami is a good time to marry people.

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:19.040
Our sixteen marriages, which one has failed?

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.520
Last time?

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.920
For the sixteen… no, sixteen here, in London.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.960
Who were the sixteen people, let’s see.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.840
All first class. All first class, yeah.

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.920
Yeah. Good.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.760
So, for next marriage lot…

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.040
Some will be lucky in behind like Nick; I would like him to marry.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.880
Now you are not so frightened, are you? Nick? No. It’s good.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:12.280
[PHRASE IN HINDI]

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.040
On the Dashera day we can have marriage.

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.080
Dussehra day. That’s another day one can marry.

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:21.600
Now, Krishnashtami and Dussehra day… of course, after the Diwali,

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.200
after the marriage of the Tulasi —

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.920
then only people start, but Dussehra day is very very good,

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.640
it’s very auspicious. [PHRASE IN HINDI].

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.840
So we’ll have marriages on Dashera day.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.720
Till then, prepare people for marriage.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.960
All right? Dashera will be, say, about…

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.160
End of October. About. All right?

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.560
YOGI: Yes, lovely, thank you.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.520
SHRI MATAJI: Let’s find out where will I be.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.720
So, that’s how.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.200
YOGI: Mother, I was going to ask that…

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.720
some Sahaja Yogis who’ve been in Sahaja Yoga for a long time

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.200
don’t feel cool breeze; they don’t feel any catches.

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:15.920
Some people feel burning all the time;

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.480
some people feel these things in their head,

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.680
in their body, toes, hands.

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.640
It’s the way we’re gonna develop,

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.320
where you can feel things — all of us, all over —

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.440
or is it just some people feel different things?

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.160
SHRI MATAJI: No no. You see, to begin with,

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.320
you see, it has something to do with your nervous system. All right?

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.120
So, if your nervous system is disturbed, you may not feel, at all.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.840
For the nervous system, best thing is to do massage.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.640
You see, somebody should massage their back, hands…

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.280
Also, I’ve told many a times that you rub your hands

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.840
with vibrated olive oil, quite a lot,

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.320
and rub these things, so they become sensitive.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.200
Could be with insensitivity.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.760
But if they can feel the catches in the body,

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.680
that means they are all right, only the Vishuddhi is not all right.

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.280
Rub the thing on the Vishuddhi, work on Vishuddhi, clear it out.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.560
And for Vishuddhi, if you can use, say,

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.880
butter to rub on the… here,

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.880
and rub all these muscles, you see, with that.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.120
All these things will work out, for your hand.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.960
But supposing you are… there’s no cool breeze

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.080
coming out of the head, possibly.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:25.600
Then the Realization yet not has established.

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.120
See, other people should say whether there is a cool breeze coming,

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.320
because the person who is not realized may not feel it.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.960
Supposing he does not feel it, and you feel it,

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.720
then he is realized; only thing, his chakras are to be cleared out.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.920
It’s a different different category of people.

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:41.200
Then, there are some people whose Kundalini has not risen;

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.760
they are still Sahaja Yogis. Like that.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.240
Maybe. I don’t know if there are any.

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.000
Those people who are unmarried for long,

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.080
they are very difficult people because they never feel

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.440
the cool breeze in the hand, quite a lot. Like that.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.120
But it is not so. They are realized souls in any case.

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.560
They may not feel it, but they are realized souls, you see.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.600
Because a kind of a softness, a kind of a balance

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:04.440
is developed after marriage — which is not there.

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:07.280
And that’s how some people don’t feel it.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.880
There are various reasons.

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.480
Some people who are ego-oriented more —

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.200
they should turn their left to the right many a times.

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.400
They should find out… from the hands, you see.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.560
One hand is bigger, one hand is smaller.

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760
That means the left hand — if it is smaller —

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.840
that means you have to raise left to the right.

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.600
You see, from the size of the hands and all that you can see it.

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.520
Putting one hand towards the photograph, another hand outside…

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:30.280
Work it out in so many ways,

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:34.000
because you have permutations and combinations of certain mistakes.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.800
But that doesn’t mean you develop this Left Vishuddhi by any chance.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.880
Because that’s the worst thing that can happen.

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.200
If you develop the Left Vishuddhi,

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.000
then it’s a very difficult situation for you.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.680
Now, for this kind of a thing,

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.640
I think I’ll give you a complete lecture on one day.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:58.560
Complete. As to see what permutations and combinations

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:03.680
of different chakras can create. All right?

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.440
But symptoms are outside.

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.200
The symptoms are mostly outside; there’s no need to…

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:15.680
from a personality you can see what it is he is catching, you see.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.600
Is a very… problem, great problem with people,

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:25.600
that they don’t feel the vibrations; some people just don’t feel it.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.480
How many there are like that, who never feel any vibrations?

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.000
Never felt, never… raise you hand. I know, Kerry.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.040
YOGI: Not never.

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.920
SHRI MATAJI: And you never… you have felt it sometime. All right.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:41.000
YOGI: Mother, since I came to the ashram I’ve been…

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.640
my hands have been very hot all the time.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.160
SHRI MATAJI: Which way? YOGI: But I feel the catches inside.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.000
SHRI MATAJI: Both the hands are?

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:51.440
What work you are doing in the ashram?

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.200
YOGI: Not very much, Mother.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.840
SHRI MATAJI: All right. You had a left-side catch, all right?

YOGI: But I [FORGET TO LET YOU KNOW?].

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:05.560

You got two? One will sufficient,

01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:18.880
one you keep it for the next puja.

[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI]

When I go to India, I’ll get you one.

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:58.720
It should be used for puja.

SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you.

And make a complete list, you see;

so whenever you go there, try to remember.

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:28.960
You keep one ready. Otherwise, don’t ask for it.

Because it goes little funny there, isn’t it?

It is all right for children to make mistakes,
