WEBVTT

00:13.980 --> 00:19.769
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:19.769 --> 00:37.780
At the very outset we have to know that the
truth cannot be manipulated, cannot be created,

00:37.780 --> 00:47.130
cannot be conceptualized by your mind or by
your imagination.

00:47.130 --> 00:56.270
It is what it is and has been and will be.

00:56.270 --> 01:04.379
So the truth is very simple.

01:04.379 --> 01:07.610
Very simple thing it is.

01:07.610 --> 01:30.479
But you have to have very scientific outlook
to keep your minds open because this the knowledge

01:30.479 --> 01:32.909
of the roots.

01:32.909 --> 01:39.860
What you see outside and what you know about
it is the knowledge about the tree.

01:39.860 --> 01:50.659
And should accept whatever I am saying as
a hypothesis and if it is proved then as honest

01:50.659 --> 01:54.840
people you have to accept it.

01:54.840 --> 02:09.910
The truth is very simple that all this universe,
this cosmos is looked after, is nourished,

02:09.910 --> 02:23.660
is guided by all pervading divine power which
is in Sanskrit language you can call it as

02:23.660 --> 02:32.720
paramachaitanya and in quran its called as
rooh.

02:32.720 --> 02:45.510
In every great scriptures it is described
as a formless energy that looks after guides

02:45.510 --> 03:04.110
everything that is living works out every
balance of this universe , of this earth.

03:04.110 --> 03:17.760
Only at the level of human awareness we have
freedom to choose because we have to rise

03:17.760 --> 03:26.510
to higher awareness of complete freedom.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.420
That is why we commit mistakes.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.150
Doesn’t matter.

03:31.150 --> 03:37.940
After all we are human being we are not Gods.

03:37.940 --> 03:45.790
So if we commit mistakes it makes it makes
no difference whatsoever for your ascent to

03:45.790 --> 03:48.020
that higher level.

03:48.020 --> 04:01.220
And the higher level is the second truth that
you are not this body not this mind, not your

04:01.220 --> 04:07.330
ego nor your conditionings but you are pure
spirit.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.900
That is what you have to be.

04:10.900 --> 04:20.769
This can only work out through the living
process of evolutionary ascent .

04:20.769 --> 04:27.750
you have become a human being and now you
have to become a higher human being.

04:27.750 --> 04:36.250
As a human being you a develop a new kind
of awareness.

04:36.250 --> 04:43.699
On your central nervous system whatever we
have achieved in our evolution we feel it

04:43.699 --> 04:48.610
on our nervous system.

04:48.610 --> 04:54.719
Like if you take dog or a horse through a
place which is very filthy, dirty smelling

04:54.719 --> 05:00.050
it can pass through.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.270
But human being cannot.

05:02.270 --> 05:06.810
human beings have the sense of the colour
of beauty of so many things they have achieved

05:06.810 --> 05:08.100
through their evolutionary process.

05:08.100 --> 05:17.300
But still the ascent is necessary because
we do not know the absolute.

05:17.300 --> 05:26.490
Whatever we know partially based on our experiences
and our mistakes.

05:26.490 --> 05:36.130
But sometimes we are so self opinionated that
we don’t want to say that we have done mistakes

05:36.130 --> 05:39.710
or not do we want to see that we want to seek
higher.

05:39.710 --> 05:46.090
But there are a category of people so many
of them which William Blakes has beautifully

05:46.090 --> 05:49.150
described as men seeking God.

05:49.150 --> 05:51.970
Its very simple.

05:51.970 --> 06:04.380
The people who are seeking the truth and these
are a special category who become sages.

06:04.380 --> 06:10.729
And these sages he says will have power to
make others the sages.

06:10.729 --> 06:17.550
?? Louis has described, all over the world
people have described about these great things

06:17.550 --> 06:22.499
going t happen in this modern times.

06:22.499 --> 06:28.600
Specially in India there was a pioneer or
this is the one who originated of astrology

06:28.600 --> 06:32.159
Bhrigumuni has written a book called nadi-granth.

06:32.159 --> 06:36.669
In which he has described sahaja yoga, very
clearly.

06:36.669 --> 06:45.529
And he has said that such a time will come
when people will get their realization sahaja.

06:45.529 --> 06:56.710
Saha mean with , ja means born; born with
you is the right united “yoga” with the

06:56.710 --> 06:57.710
divine.

06:57.710 --> 07:02.409
In modern yoga that we have got is a v bit
of a v bit.

07:02.409 --> 07:03.749
It has nothing to do with reality.

07:03.749 --> 07:11.610
To know the reality, to feel the all pervading
power is a right of every human being.

07:11.610 --> 07:13.629
That’s all is called yoga.

07:13.629 --> 07:19.490
And the another word another meaning of the
yoga is yukti meaning the depthness.

07:19.490 --> 07:39.590
The depthness to know to how to work out this
power and also to know the principles of divine

07:39.590 --> 07:41.500
powers.

07:41.500 --> 07:51.169
But that is not mentally is no t mentally,
it is on your nervous system.

07:51.169 --> 08:00.620
In the Buddhist philosophies is described
as bodha.

08:00.620 --> 08:08.559
Bodh doesn’t mean you feel it as a kind
of a think??.

08:08.559 --> 08:14.719
But, you feel it on your central nervous system.

08:14.719 --> 08:21.449
Its not a some sort of a sensationalisaton
but it is actulisation.

08:21.449 --> 08:23.089
That is bodha.

08:23.089 --> 08:25.539
Even the word vedas come from vida.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.900
Vida also means on the central nervous system.

08:28.900 --> 08:34.780
The reality is to be felt on our central nervous
system.

08:34.780 --> 08:45.230
Now we have here with us this mechanism built
in.

08:45.230 --> 08:47.480
in the bible its known as the tree of life.

08:47.480 --> 08:52.110
Kirshna has also described it as a tree of
life which is upside down.

08:52.110 --> 08:57.840
The roots of which are in the head.

08:57.840 --> 09:06.490
This is the tree of life described in most
of the scriptures in different names.

09:06.490 --> 09:12.470
Like in Tao, it refers to yangtze river as
tao.

09:12.470 --> 09:21.160
That tao is nothing but this kundalini which
is the power which enlightens this tree of

09:21.160 --> 09:22.160
life.

09:22.160 --> 09:30.530
This kundalini is a power resides in the triangular
bone known as sacrum.

09:30.530 --> 09:33.920
Sacrum in latin language means sacred.

09:33.920 --> 09:39.670
That means the Greeks knew in ancient times
that this is a sacred bone which has something

09:39.670 --> 09:41.490
sacred in it.

09:41.490 --> 09:46.540
We all have this residual power within us
known as kundalini.

09:46.540 --> 09:54.150
Ofcourse in the modern times people have created
all kinds of myths about the kundalini saying

09:54.150 --> 09:55.150
it is very dangerous.

09:55.150 --> 09:56.150
One should not do this and all.

09:56.150 --> 09:57.150
Its all modern.

09:57.150 --> 10:06.080
But in the ancient books even upto the time
of Kabira they have all described it very

10:06.080 --> 10:08.630
clearly, no body has said it is dangerous.

10:08.630 --> 10:15.970
So may be some of the fake ones wanted to
create a fear because they didn’t want people

10:15.970 --> 10:16.970
to know the reality.

10:16.970 --> 10:23.030
The must have created this kind of a myth
saying that it is dangerous to awaken the

10:23.030 --> 10:24.030
kundalini.

10:24.030 --> 10:31.591
But this is the mother, your mother, your
individual mother who is going to give you

10:31.591 --> 10:33.500
your self-realization.

10:33.500 --> 10:39.910
As your mother has taken all the troubles,
labour problem upon herself; she takes all

10:39.910 --> 10:45.610
the problems you have and you get a very smooth
?? as self-realised souls.

10:45.610 --> 10:48.270
This has to happen.

10:48.270 --> 10:54.650
Because it is the vital, it is so vital that
it has to be easy.

10:54.650 --> 10:55.650
For eg.

10:55.650 --> 11:00.220
Our breathing if you had to go to the library
and read books and do all kinds of things,

11:00.220 --> 11:02.020
we would not have existed.

11:02.020 --> 11:07.610
In the same way it is such a vital thing that
this kundalini has to rise.

11:07.610 --> 11:15.220
Ofcourse, in the beginning of life this tree
of life had very few flowers.

11:15.220 --> 11:19.800
But gradually now I feel it’s a blossom
time.

11:19.800 --> 11:25.420
There are so many seekers who are seeking
the truth and it is working wonders.

11:25.420 --> 11:33.200
In a one day lecture, in a program like this
its very hard to explain everything about

11:33.200 --> 11:34.200
kundalini.

11:34.200 --> 11:43.890
As it is I must have spoken thousands of times
and then must be atleast 4000 tapes in English

11:43.890 --> 11:44.890
language alone.

11:44.890 --> 11:47.090
I have been working for 20 years to establish
sahaja yoga all over the world.

11:47.090 --> 11:54.370
And now there are 40 nations who have come
to sahaja yoga.

11:54.370 --> 12:02.240
And I must pay full respect to Russians whom
I found to be the best people for spirituality.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.160
The best people for spirituality.

12:05.160 --> 12:11.380
Whatever they might have been under, whatever
might have happened to them, one thing they

12:11.380 --> 12:13.510
didn’t waste the time much.

12:13.510 --> 12:20.180
They were all very well educated, very solid
sensible wise people.

12:20.180 --> 12:23.980
And the way they took to sahaja yoga I was
myself surprised.

12:23.980 --> 12:28.530
We just arrived there and there were thousands.

12:28.530 --> 12:34.860
And how did they managed to get their realization
so fast and establish it is really, even the

12:34.860 --> 12:38.180
Indians should feel ashamed of themselves.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.820
Because this is the heritage of India.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.460
This is the heritage of India.

12:43.460 --> 12:49.040
But we had 300 years the Britishers ruling
us perhaps so we have all become very westernized,

12:49.040 --> 12:50.040
perhaps.

12:50.040 --> 12:56.140
But I just don’t understand that how these
people who have never talked of God, religion;

12:56.140 --> 12:58.740
thank God for that also sometimes.

12:58.740 --> 13:03.050
Because religion is also now a days man made;
has conditioned people too much.

13:03.050 --> 13:07.170
And they had no such fake gurus there roaming
about.

13:07.170 --> 13:13.150
And they just jumped into it.

13:13.150 --> 13:19.320
Such a remarkable thing to see a country so
far away, kept away from all the theologies

13:19.320 --> 13:22.560
jumping into spirituality so fast.

13:22.560 --> 13:27.160
Even ofcourse in India we have lots of people
who are sahaja yogis all over I must admit

13:27.160 --> 13:29.700
because after all this is their heritage.

13:29.700 --> 13:38.422
And also in India we should say there are
3 doctors who have done MD in sahaja yoga,

13:38.422 --> 13:43.310
they have tried to prove that with sahaja
yoga means the kundalini awakening; you can

13:43.310 --> 13:45.840
get rid of psychosomatic diseases.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.260
You get better health.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.730
Also you can get epilepsy and all such mental
diseases cured.

13:52.730 --> 13:55.850
They have got MD for that.

13:55.850 --> 14:01.860
There are 7 doctors in London who are trying
to collect all the data about it and they

14:01.860 --> 14:04.110
also want to do their MDs.

14:04.110 --> 14:12.780
Also this in Cambridge university this gentleman
who is already a professor of philosophy is

14:12.780 --> 14:16.820
doing research on sahaja yoga.

14:16.820 --> 14:23.140
So, it is coming to the level of the intellectuals
and the scientists.

14:23.140 --> 14:29.600
But, scientists have to go little deeper if
they have to have to see any structure in

14:29.600 --> 14:31.520
a microscope.

14:31.520 --> 14:36.620
In the same way if we have to know about these
things, we have to have our self-realisation.

14:36.620 --> 14:40.810
Without our self realization we cannot understand
anyone.

14:40.810 --> 14:46.840
That’s what Kabira said, “what should
I do the whole world is blind, what should

14:46.840 --> 14:55.191
I tell them the whole world is deaf”; meaning
is that the level of understanding has not

14:55.191 --> 14:57.720
reached that subtle side.

14:57.720 --> 15:06.710
And that subtle side has to be ?? and that
is very simple now a days I have seen that

15:06.710 --> 15:09.390
people get realization without any difficulties.

15:09.390 --> 15:16.380
In Sydney, in Perth, in Brisbane, of all the
places in cairns I so surprised.

15:16.380 --> 15:21.780
Another surprise came from cairns which was
something just like Russia.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.550
Something out of the blue it exploded.

15:24.550 --> 15:30.240
Such beautiful people live there; So human,
so natural.

15:30.240 --> 15:40.350
I couldn’t understand how certain places
people are simple, not complicated, not conditioned

15:40.350 --> 15:42.010
and not arrogant.

15:42.010 --> 15:47.870
They have such a simplicity of understanding
and they just take to it so easily.

15:47.870 --> 15:53.540
Now, in Australia also we have lots of sahaja
yogis who are working it out.

15:53.540 --> 16:01.110
But in the earlier, early times we didn’t
have very good leaders who were I should say

16:01.110 --> 16:06.070
very well motivated towards sahaja yoga.

16:06.070 --> 16:08.050
And so it was going up and down.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.000
But now I hope it will be again re-established
here.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.300
But, one thing we should be very honest with
ourselves that if we have to have our benevolence,

16:16.300 --> 16:18.570
we have to honest ourselves.

16:18.570 --> 16:23.660
If you are enamored by somebody who claims
too much, talks too much and gives you big

16:23.660 --> 16:28.880
lectures and just says alright, take this
mantra or do this and do that, all kinds of

16:28.880 --> 16:35.670
nonsensical things; you first must go and
see the person who has been to him.

16:35.670 --> 16:39.310
What is he doing, what has he got.

16:39.310 --> 16:42.500
Has he got any spiritual power or not.

16:42.500 --> 16:49.250
Or just because he is going to that place
you must also go.

16:49.250 --> 16:55.900
Another problem in the west I find I must
say is the funny that they think that if something

16:55.900 --> 17:00.220
is free then it is nonsensical.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.110
This is very funny surprisingly.

17:02.110 --> 17:06.400
I went to Boston and they asked me how many
rolls royces you have.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.749
So people told she don’t take any money
how can she have rolls Royce.

17:08.749 --> 17:09.749
We are not interested.

17:09.749 --> 17:10.749
Its no business.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.350
I mean, God is not a business.

17:12.350 --> 17:15.870
And divinity is not a business.

17:15.870 --> 17:18.819
This we must understand that we can’t pay
for it.

17:18.819 --> 17:22.630
How much do we pay to the mother earth when
she produces all the beautiful things for

17:22.630 --> 17:23.630
us.

17:23.630 --> 17:27.159
In the same way how much are we going to pay
for our spirituality.

17:27.159 --> 17:28.159
Live alone anything.

17:28.159 --> 17:29.879
How much do you pay to Christ.

17:29.879 --> 17:35.330
On the contrary you sold him out.

17:35.330 --> 17:39.720
So this is simple thing of course Indians
understand better.

17:39.720 --> 17:45.090
But others also should understand that you
can’t pay for him.

17:45.090 --> 17:50.539
Anybody who asks money for this, you must
know is something very serious with it.

17:50.539 --> 17:58.080
If we I want you to take some money from you,
you wouldn’t because you are self respecting.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.940
The ones who takes money from you has no self
respect.

18:01.940 --> 18:06.409
You have retained him some sort of you are
retainers something like that.

18:06.409 --> 18:11.850
And one must understand this is a very important
very point for all western people to understand

18:11.850 --> 18:13.669
that you can’t pay for it.

18:13.669 --> 18:16.690
But sometimes I think it satisfies your ego
that you can purchase your guru.

18:16.690 --> 18:19.049
You can’t.

18:19.049 --> 18:23.250
if you can purchase your guru he can be your
servant, not your guru.

18:23.250 --> 18:29.049
This I want to make very clear to you because
this is not understood in the west because

18:29.049 --> 18:35.890
they are used to the systems where people
sell out or give money for everything.

18:35.890 --> 18:46.970
Now we have here, this systems which is very
interesting and is absolutely nicely put into

18:46.970 --> 18:49.360
our being.

18:49.360 --> 19:01.240
Below the kundalini, that is the triangular
bone; is the centre called as mooladhara chakra

19:01.240 --> 19:03.289
means the centre of mooladhara.

19:03.289 --> 19:07.530
Now mooladhara means the support of the roots.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.970
And the roots are the kundalini.

19:09.970 --> 19:17.720
The kundalini is in the 3 ½ coil that’s
why it is called as kundalini because coil

19:17.720 --> 19:18.890
means kundal.

19:18.890 --> 19:26.260
Now these, other centres are 6 above it.

19:26.260 --> 19:32.649
so one thing is sure that the last centre
does not come into play when the kundalini

19:32.649 --> 19:33.649
rises.

19:33.649 --> 19:40.129
So one should understand that all the functions
of the first centre which caters to our excretions

19:40.129 --> 19:45.370
inclusive of sex has nothing to with our ascent.

19:45.370 --> 19:50.039
So when kundalini starts rising these functions
just stop.

19:50.039 --> 19:52.159
All these functions stop.

19:52.159 --> 19:58.379
First centre ?? into the yellow centre which
we call as swadhishthana.

19:58.379 --> 20:04.960
In a place like Canberra I think I better
talk about this centre.

20:04.960 --> 20:11.179
Because last year when I came swadhishthana
was here so caught up that my foot became

20:11.179 --> 20:13.309
paralysed with it.

20:13.309 --> 20:19.740
Now the swadhishthana centre you can see that
as got a ?? in it, yellow one.

20:19.740 --> 20:31.340
When we use it we work out the right side
channel which is the channel of the sun, which

20:31.340 --> 20:33.440
is for our future.

20:33.440 --> 20:42.160
And also it is for our mental and our physical
work.

20:42.160 --> 20:51.789
So when we think too much and we plan too
much for the future, which is of course the

20:51.789 --> 20:56.400
thing going on here, so this centre goes out
of ??.

20:56.400 --> 21:04.789
Like I would say there is another side to
it, is another one, which is we call as the

21:04.789 --> 21:14.860
channel for our emotion, for our desire and
the channel that looks after all our past.

21:14.860 --> 21:24.919
This is the centre what we call as the, this
is the channel as we call it as the channel

21:24.919 --> 21:32.720
of ida or is the channel of moon.

21:32.720 --> 21:38.019
So the right side looks after the right sympathetic
nervous system and the left side looks after

21:38.019 --> 21:40.039
the left sympathetic nervous system.

21:40.039 --> 21:47.150
And the central path is for our ascent which
also caters to our parasympathetic nervous

21:47.150 --> 21:48.150
system.

21:48.150 --> 21:54.040
That is we can understand it this way that
if we run fast our heart beat increases.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.960
So it means the emergency.

21:55.960 --> 22:03.000
For all emergencies the sympathetic nervous
system goes into action and when it goes into

22:03.000 --> 22:11.100
action then only the para sympathetic, central
path reduces, brings it to normal.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.230
That we can’t do.

22:12.230 --> 22:16.600
We can only play about with the left or the
right sympathetic system.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.860
That means we can only go to the left side
or to the right side.

22:19.860 --> 22:24.950
That means we can only go to our past or to
our future.

22:24.950 --> 22:31.240
But we cannot be in the present.

22:31.240 --> 22:36.639
we cannot be in the present.

22:36.639 --> 22:44.470
And absolute can only be known in the present
because that’s reality.

22:44.470 --> 22:48.110
The past is finished, the future doesn’t
exists.

22:48.110 --> 22:51.909
Reality is when you are the present.

22:51.909 --> 22:53.409
But how to be in the present.

22:53.409 --> 22:54.409
That’s the problem.

22:54.409 --> 22:58.749
For a thought rises and falls, another thought
rises and falls.

22:58.749 --> 23:03.090
We are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

23:03.090 --> 23:09.429
But we cannot achieve that state where we
are in the present and that’s why we go

23:09.429 --> 23:11.389
into tensions, we go into problems.

23:11.389 --> 23:16.460
I will show you here like this is the centre;
and on the left and the right side there’s

23:16.460 --> 23:17.460
the energy moving.

23:17.460 --> 23:23.080
Supposing you go too much on the right or
too much on the left, there’s a movement

23:23.080 --> 23:30.600
going on and there’s a constriction, in
the constriction, in the centre, in the ?? centre.

23:30.600 --> 23:35.990
But apart from this constriction the energy
is exhausted.

23:35.990 --> 23:41.429
If the energy is too much exhausted and say
its moving on the right and there is something

23:41.429 --> 23:45.919
happens on the left side, something emotional,
something some accident or some shock; immediately

23:45.919 --> 23:55.320
it looses this balance and as a result you
develop a disease which we call as psychosomatic

23:55.320 --> 24:02.200
that includes all your ?? diseases where the
degeneration of muscles takes place.

24:02.200 --> 24:09.039
Also it includes your cancer, blood cancer
all sort of these psychosomatic diseases which

24:09.039 --> 24:10.860
are incurable.

24:10.860 --> 24:17.840
So when the kundalini rises she passes through
this and this and sort of as if a thread is

24:17.840 --> 24:28.659
pass through and it all gets absolutely in
connection with the whole.

24:28.659 --> 24:32.690
So there cannot be any malignancy because
the connection is established.

24:32.690 --> 24:36.360
And also also she nourishes that centre.

24:36.360 --> 24:42.279
As that nourishment takes place, the person
gets alright and he feels perfect.

24:42.279 --> 24:44.539
This is how sahaja yoga works.

24:44.539 --> 24:50.369
So it is your own energy within you, it is
your own property within you; when it rises

24:50.369 --> 24:54.110
it gives you that power that you get cured.

24:54.110 --> 24:58.470
But when it is connected with the mains with
all pervading power.

24:58.470 --> 25:02.009
Its all the time flowing through you.

25:02.009 --> 25:08.279
So even if there is any imbalance, it brings
you to balance.

25:08.279 --> 25:13.649
Suddenly you also feel all this in, all pervading
power on your finger tips.

25:13.649 --> 25:19.580
In the Quran there is one beautiful sura called
“sajda yoga”.

25:19.580 --> 25:26.679
In that they have described all about it that
your hands will speak and the time of resurrection

25:26.679 --> 25:29.700
and they will give witness against you.

25:29.700 --> 25:35.520
So now we will today discuss one centre which
is very important for all of you I think because

25:35.520 --> 25:40.419
you are all working in the government and
I know what government services.

25:40.419 --> 25:47.200
Because my husband has been all his life the
government service and later on he was with

25:47.200 --> 25:48.200
the UN.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.620
So I know what it means and what happens to
them .

25:51.620 --> 26:00.179
now this centre swadhishthana, as I told you,
caters for physical and mental activities,

26:00.179 --> 26:01.179
functions.

26:01.179 --> 26:11.740
Now the physical activity may be less, but
the most important function of this centre

26:11.740 --> 26:16.289
is to convert the fat cells for the use of
the brain.

26:16.289 --> 26:22.850
When we think too much then our grey cells
are used and they are to be replaced.

26:22.850 --> 26:29.440
So this replacement takes place through the
function of this centre which transforms ordinary

26:29.440 --> 26:34.320
fat cells for the use of the brain.

26:34.320 --> 26:43.830
But it has some other functions also to be
done, which are subsidiary but are very important.

26:43.830 --> 26:52.029
So it looks after your liver, it looks after
your pancreas, it looks after your spleen,

26:52.029 --> 26:57.830
it looks after your kidney and part of your
intestines.

26:57.830 --> 27:09.070
Now, if we make this centre work so hard it
neglects other important functions.

27:09.070 --> 27:12.559
So first it neglects is the liver.

27:12.559 --> 27:20.029
And the function of the liver is to absorb
the poison of the body as heat into itself

27:20.029 --> 27:24.129
and release it into the blood stream.

27:24.129 --> 27:33.850
But once this centre neglects and doesn’t
give energy to liver, the heat in the body

27:33.850 --> 27:37.559
remains as it is and it starts rising on the
right side.

27:37.559 --> 27:43.249
when it starts rising on the right side it
gives you diseases like asthama because you

27:43.249 --> 27:47.169
have another centre called right heart.

27:47.169 --> 27:49.619
It can also give you a massive heart attack.

27:49.619 --> 27:54.029
People don’t know its all due to liver trouble.

27:54.029 --> 28:03.570
But some how if this liver is clicked by movement
of the left side then one can get all kinds

28:03.570 --> 28:07.120
of allergies and all kinds of problems which
are skin troubles.

28:07.120 --> 28:15.940
So when we sit in the sun, it is not the sun
that spoils our skins but it is the liver

28:15.940 --> 28:24.440
which gets heated up and can’t bear anymore
of that and that’s how you get your skin

28:24.440 --> 28:26.640
diseases like skin cancer.

28:26.640 --> 28:32.659
Then the second very important it has to look
after is your pancreas.

28:32.659 --> 28:43.179
Function of the pancreas is to dissolve the
sugar for use of the body and give to the

28:43.179 --> 28:49.879
other organs; supply the energy for it because
it has the carbohydrates in it.

28:49.879 --> 28:56.779
But when this centre is so much looking after
one side of transforming ordinary fat cells

28:56.779 --> 29:04.350
into grey cells, again they neglect, creates
a problem and you develop a horrible disease

29:04.350 --> 29:05.610
called diabetes.

29:05.610 --> 29:18.460
Now if you go the villages of India you will
be surprised when they make tea, the cup contain

29:18.460 --> 29:23.009
so much of sugar that a spoon has to stand
at right angle.

29:23.009 --> 29:24.389
Thats the measure.

29:24.389 --> 29:27.960
Otherwise its not tea, its not good.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.690
And they take such a lot of sugar they never
get diabetes.

29:31.690 --> 29:35.080
They never get diabetes because they don’t
think.

29:35.080 --> 29:41.960
They just live nicely, earn for the day, sleep
off, we will see tomorrow.

29:41.960 --> 29:47.409
But those people who are sedentary, who are
working hard, thinking too much, futuristic

29:47.409 --> 29:51.999
planning; make their centre work only for
that purpose, really go against themselves

29:51.999 --> 29:54.679
and get this horrible disease called diabetes.

29:54.679 --> 30:03.110
Which is ofcourse curable if the kundalini
is there to help you.

30:03.110 --> 30:10.269
Then the third is even a worst one which is
coming from your spleen.

30:10.269 --> 30:16.399
Now spleen is your speedometer or we say it
is the one that keeps the rhythm of life.

30:16.399 --> 30:22.409
But in this modern times you have lost the
rhythm of life and all the time we are under

30:22.409 --> 30:24.830
shock, something is happening.

30:24.830 --> 30:33.200
So much so without sensationalisation we do
not feel any, any existence of our own.

30:33.200 --> 30:41.019
Like early in the morning you will get up,
first you will read the news paper.

30:41.019 --> 30:44.059
News paper means what; its a shock.

30:44.059 --> 30:47.649
Somebody died, somebody killed, some mishaps
n now its a hail storm, this and that something

30:47.649 --> 30:48.649
is there.

30:48.649 --> 30:50.869
With shocks you get worried.

30:50.869 --> 30:54.039
May be some of your relations are killed;
what has happened.

30:54.039 --> 31:00.909
So the first thing the spleen goes into the
jeopardy because the spleen has to supply

31:00.909 --> 31:03.690
red blood carpuscles at the emergency of like
this.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.529
And the second shock is may be jam on the
way.

31:06.529 --> 31:08.049
We are time bound.

31:08.049 --> 31:12.679
If the time is there we must reach in time,
and if you don’t reach in time as if you

31:12.679 --> 31:17.690
are going to be hanged or there is a already
and order coming from death coming to our

31:17.690 --> 31:19.630
?? ; that shaking conditions we live.

31:19.630 --> 31:26.979
All the time under tense conditions that we
must keep to time, we must keep to these norms,

31:26.979 --> 31:31.820
must do this; and the modern life has made
our life so artificial so artificial, that,

31:31.820 --> 31:35.039
supposing you are eating your food.

31:35.039 --> 31:38.450
Now you must keep your spoon and fork in a
way.

31:38.450 --> 31:40.409
I mean God has not told you that.

31:40.409 --> 31:47.610
But its something sort of a norm that we must
have a fork and spoon like that.

31:47.610 --> 31:50.190
Now, if you have not kept it then everybody
laugh at you.

31:50.190 --> 31:53.549
So by chance if you have not kept it you are
in trouble.

31:53.549 --> 31:58.440
Small small things absolutely good for nothing,
have covered our being as good as behaviour

31:58.440 --> 32:05.970
as something very posh as something very…
I don’t what they will say.

32:05.970 --> 32:10.929
But french will say something, english will
say something and everybody has a different

32:10.929 --> 32:11.929
style.

32:11.929 --> 32:17.029
And if you do not cope with it then you are
absolutely a rustic person, you have no manners,

32:17.029 --> 32:18.029
nothing.

32:18.029 --> 32:21.730
You can pass dirty jokes, you can say all
dirty things, doesn’t matter that doesn’t

32:21.730 --> 32:23.409
matter… thats all right.

32:23.409 --> 32:29.899
You can drink as much as u like , you can
fall on the table doesn’t matter after all

32:29.899 --> 32:31.659
he was drunk so excused.

32:31.659 --> 32:32.659
See.

32:32.659 --> 32:37.270
But if you all do nonsensical things you are
a gone case.

32:37.270 --> 32:39.320
All these things way upon us.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.509
Now we have to dress up like this, we have
to be like that, if you don’t dress up like

32:43.509 --> 32:45.119
that its out fashion .

32:45.119 --> 32:50.159
We do not know in subtle ways that we are
playing into the hands of these entrepreneurs,

32:50.159 --> 32:51.840
just befooling us all the time.

32:51.840 --> 32:57.809
And thats how this tension, what to dress
what not to dress, you have to be formal or

32:57.809 --> 33:00.989
informal, what to do what to eat, how to call.

33:00.989 --> 33:06.330
Even to have rapport with someone is not,
u see, you cannot talk to someone at the same

33:06.330 --> 33:08.489
level as human being.

33:08.489 --> 33:10.749
On the contrary we think twice what should
I say.

33:10.749 --> 33:18.519
We will rehearse it at home and then we face
the person and we go completely in mess because

33:18.519 --> 33:20.779
we think no I can’t say that.

33:20.779 --> 33:22.399
We start on something else.

33:22.399 --> 33:28.369
There is no relaxed personality and we always
say I am not relaxed, I am tensed.

33:28.369 --> 33:29.369
But why.

33:29.369 --> 33:30.369
Animals are not tensed.

33:30.369 --> 33:31.440
They live in the same city.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.609
Nobody seems to be tensed.

33:32.609 --> 33:34.399
Trees are not tensed.

33:34.399 --> 33:36.039
Why are human beings tensed.

33:36.039 --> 33:42.619
Because they themselves have made these kind
of funny cages for themselves and they think

33:42.619 --> 33:45.659
that this is important to me like that.

33:45.659 --> 33:53.940
So all this leads to lots of shocks for our
speedometer which is a poor instrument for

33:53.940 --> 33:59.419
such a person which can’t understand and
becomes crazy.

33:59.419 --> 34:04.470
And when it is crazy it becomes vulnerable
and then you get a very serious disease called

34:04.470 --> 34:05.470
as blood cancer.

34:05.470 --> 34:16.460
You will be surprised that sahaja yoga has
cured blood cancer of many people.

34:16.460 --> 34:21.869
Not only that but those who are certified
thats all doctors do in blood cancer, to die

34:21.869 --> 34:28.190
within 10 days or 1 month are still there
after 5-6 years and doing very well.

34:28.190 --> 34:34.730
The reason is this spleen becomes good shock
absorber.

34:34.730 --> 34:37.539
Why that I will tell you later on.

34:37.539 --> 34:40.020
Now also you get your blood pressure.

34:40.020 --> 34:45.179
because of this your kidneys are affected,
your intestine goes out, so you will ?? to

34:45.179 --> 34:46.270
constipation the thing.

34:46.270 --> 34:54.810
So all these troubles come out of one that
we think too much.

34:54.810 --> 34:57.599
Now thinking cannot be stopped.

34:57.599 --> 34:59.200
Thats troubles.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.700
Thinking is coming all the time invading us.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.660
You can’t stop thinking.

35:04.660 --> 35:07.170
What should we do to stop thinking.

35:07.170 --> 35:14.780
For that if the kundalini rises you reach
a state, state of mind where you are thoughtlessly

35:14.780 --> 35:15.780
aware.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.780
There is not thought.

35:16.780 --> 35:20.119
You are aware absolutely aware but no thought.

35:20.119 --> 35:24.680
If you want to think you will think otherwise
you wouldn’t think just you wouldn’t think.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.780
And you are in that state.

35:26.780 --> 35:33.400
That state in sanskrit is called as nirvichar
samadhi which instantly takes place and the

35:33.400 --> 35:37.680
second stage you see we call is nirvikalpa
samadhi is doubtless awareness.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.720
Where you become absolutely detached.

35:39.720 --> 35:46.319
Like you are in the water you are afraid of
water.

35:46.319 --> 35:52.430
But suppose you get into the boat you can
watch the water alrigh, quiet relaxed.

35:52.430 --> 35:56.800
But supposing you know how to swim you can
jump in the water and save people who are

35:56.800 --> 35:57.950
getting drowned.

35:57.950 --> 36:02.662
In the same way when that state comes in where
you can jump and save other people and help

36:02.662 --> 36:10.280
other people then that state is called as
a state of doubtless awareness.

36:10.280 --> 36:17.849
With this a person becomes extremely extremely
powerful, dynamic.

36:17.849 --> 36:25.750
At the same time such a person becomes extremely
compassionate extremely compassionate.

36:25.750 --> 36:35.359
He bcomes a person who sees everything witness
everything as a drama.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.470
He gets out of it and sees everything as a
drama.

36:38.470 --> 36:44.760
He doesn’t get involved into problems but
he can see his problems clearly by which he

36:44.760 --> 36:47.180
can solve them better.

36:47.180 --> 36:54.200
And such a person then becomes a very good
human being because he becomes righteous.

36:54.200 --> 36:59.869
The are you see above that is the green area
is the area where our valencies are.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.450
Which are 10 valencies.

37:01.450 --> 37:07.030
Carbon has 4 we have 10 valencies and they
get enlightened.

37:07.030 --> 37:12.140
They get enlightened and that is what is innate
within us.

37:12.140 --> 37:17.770
Like carbon has 4 religions, in the same way
within us aer the 10 religions which are called

37:17.770 --> 37:23.450
in sanskrit as dharma, dharma eti sa dharma
the one we sustain within us is the dharma.

37:23.450 --> 37:28.500
Not that we practice say something and practice
something is not dharma is not dharma not

37:28.500 --> 37:29.500
religion.

37:29.500 --> 37:34.390
The one we sustain within us and this sustenance
takes place when the kundalini rises she enlightens

37:34.390 --> 37:37.930
that p?? and such a person becomes righteous
absolutely righteous.

37:37.930 --> 37:42.609
He is not bothered as to what others are doing.

37:42.609 --> 37:49.940
He lives with his own righteousness, enjoys
it, he enjoys his virtues and he sees the

37:49.940 --> 37:51.470
good point in others.

37:51.470 --> 37:58.789
Somehow or the other by his temperament and
nature and his magnetic personality he attracts

37:58.789 --> 38:03.990
others and tries to transform them only by
his existence.

38:03.990 --> 38:10.900
Now christ was a very subtle deity I should
say ?? subtle incarnation because he has said

38:10.900 --> 38:14.530
though shall not have adulterous eyes.

38:14.530 --> 38:17.770
though shall not have adulterous eyes.

38:17.770 --> 38:24.190
Now I would like to know in what christian
nation I should find such a people.

38:24.190 --> 38:31.079
Even the eyes because when you become realised
then you will be surprised your innocence

38:31.079 --> 38:32.079
comes back.

38:32.079 --> 38:34.350
Eyes become absolutely still.

38:34.350 --> 38:42.920
And such person when he develops further,
his even a glance of such a person can do

38:42.920 --> 38:45.990
wonders because there is no lust, no greed.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.630
You just watch.

38:47.630 --> 38:50.359
And watching something is the biggest boon.

38:50.359 --> 38:56.190
Suppose I see something beautiful and then
I react as a human being I am to react.

38:56.190 --> 39:02.500
So it is in my mind “oh God it will get
dirty and it is not insured or something sort

39:02.500 --> 39:03.540
of a nonsensical.

39:03.540 --> 39:09.799
Supposing it belongs to somebody then I start
thinking how much she must have paid and where

39:09.799 --> 39:11.470
should I get it.

39:11.470 --> 39:13.980
All this thoughts come to us.

39:13.980 --> 39:21.210
But supposing I am just watching it then what
happens like a lake which has no ripples in

39:21.210 --> 39:25.030
it; the whole creation reflects into it.

39:25.030 --> 39:32.950
In the same way the joy of creation starts
pouring on you and you feel relax and happy.

39:32.950 --> 39:35.130
You never feel your age.

39:35.130 --> 39:37.280
You never feel you are travelling.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.170
You are with yourself wherever you are.

39:40.170 --> 39:45.760
So all these problems we have in modern times,
speediness vanishes.

39:45.760 --> 39:51.109
Not only that but your family life will improves.

39:51.109 --> 39:52.150
Your society improves.

39:52.150 --> 39:53.150
Your country improves.

39:53.150 --> 39:55.230
Its a benevolence of the whole humanity you
can achieve.

39:55.230 --> 39:57.500
This transformation is very essential.

39:57.500 --> 40:07.010
I am very happy that the Russian in all western
world have taken such a strong step forward.

40:07.010 --> 40:17.240
I know all others will also now little bit
think about it that why, why not we? Why not

40:17.240 --> 40:18.860
we seek our benevolence.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.230
Why not we have this.

40:20.230 --> 40:23.490
When it is our own power why shouldn’t we
get it.

40:23.490 --> 40:26.529
Supposing I say there is a diamond available
here, free.

40:26.529 --> 40:32.849
Then not only from America but even from Greenland
people will come here.

40:32.849 --> 40:38.980
And I say there is a diamond within you, spirit,
why not have it and for nothing at all you

40:38.980 --> 40:40.170
just get it free.

40:40.170 --> 40:42.130
So why not have.

40:42.130 --> 40:47.859
This is what should be the attitude of all
the people.

40:47.859 --> 40:52.589
All over the world, but I think there are
certain conditionings which do not help people

40:52.589 --> 40:55.029
to get to that point.

40:55.029 --> 41:00.150
So we must know we have not achieved it so
far so why not achieve it further.

41:00.150 --> 41:04.760
If we haven’t got it why not we do it.

41:04.760 --> 41:09.130
Its a times, special time.

41:09.130 --> 41:14.420
And you should not missed out.

41:14.420 --> 41:22.910
Not only, not only the people in Russia but
even the government has helped us a lot.

41:22.910 --> 41:27.950
I am quiet amazed at the wisdom of these people.

41:27.950 --> 41:32.839
I do not know what I should give the credit.

41:32.839 --> 41:35.250
They are remarkable people I must say.

41:35.250 --> 41:40.750
And a day may come it might become the most
powerful, the most powerful country in the

41:40.750 --> 41:42.950
world.

41:42.950 --> 41:47.400
I am really amazed way they have developed
within themselves the depth.

41:47.400 --> 41:55.170
There was one fellow who gave me a book which
he has written about the mathematical calculation

41:55.170 --> 41:56.170
of Shree Chakra.

41:56.170 --> 42:01.520
In India there are very few must be knowing
what Shree Chakra is.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.710
Its very surprising.

42:04.710 --> 42:13.730
And this is what I am telling you here in
Australia which you must take note no doubt.

42:13.730 --> 42:22.000
Ofcourse now your government has done one
thing is to send some people to tape, video

42:22.000 --> 42:28.580
tape me and find out, go to Russia to find
out how Russians have got it , why we haven’t

42:28.580 --> 42:29.580
got it.

42:29.580 --> 42:33.950
So in this competition may be might start
working here everywhere else.

42:33.950 --> 42:36.720
But this wisdom, wisdom is needed.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.720
What are we doing about our life.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.960
What are we doing about it we should find
out.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.299
Where are we spending our time.

42:43.299 --> 42:45.710
Why are we going to miss it.

42:45.710 --> 42:47.520
Once you get into some terrible disease then
you will come to me.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.520
Whats the use.

42:48.520 --> 42:56.950
You will be happy to know we have cured one
gentleman here of aids no doubt.

42:56.950 --> 42:58.109
He ?? mr.

42:58.109 --> 42:59.109
??.

42:59.109 --> 43:00.109
but he had no will power.

43:00.109 --> 43:06.849
He went back to the same nonsensical habit
next day and then now he is dead.

43:06.849 --> 43:09.930
But the other day in Perth two people a husband
and wife got cured of aids.

43:09.930 --> 43:11.849
So I have hope about that also.

43:11.849 --> 43:18.349
We should have will power to do little bit
of practice of sahaja yoga and keep to it,

43:18.349 --> 43:19.349
develop it.

43:19.349 --> 43:23.990
I am sure they will live much longer than
that is expected.

43:23.990 --> 43:25.109
So may God bless you.

43:25.109 --> 43:29.470
In this short time whatever is possible I
have tried to put before you.

43:29.470 --> 43:35.609
I would ofcourse like you to ask me some questions
for few minutes and then we should have this

43:35.609 --> 43:37.520
experience of self realisation.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.789
That is very important than any of our questions.

43:40.789 --> 43:44.000
Because even, I am good at answering questions.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.710
And even if I answer all your questions has
no meaning because it doesn’t guarantee

43:47.710 --> 43:49.450
your ascent.

43:49.450 --> 43:54.900
What guarantees your ascent is the happening,
is the becoming.

43:54.900 --> 43:58.960
Unless and until that happens everything else
is useless.

43:58.960 --> 44:07.779
So its not a mental feel, its more a natural
growth within you of that new awareness which

44:07.779 --> 44:11.599
we call as collective consciousness.

44:11.599 --> 44:14.490
collective consciousness.

44:14.490 --> 44:20.630
That becomes part and parcel of you that you
can on your fingertips you can feel the five,

44:20.630 --> 44:25.609
six and seven centres on your left and five,
six and seven centres on the right.

44:25.609 --> 44:28.849
Your own and that of others.

44:28.849 --> 44:34.170
So there is self realisation and also you
have the power of collective consciousness.

44:34.170 --> 44:37.789
Now even if you know within one months time
you will find out.

44:37.789 --> 44:41.950
With in one months time , that what things
are decoding.

44:41.950 --> 44:47.119
If you know what things are decoding, you
can diagnose a person, you can help the person,

44:47.119 --> 44:48.610
you can raise the kundalini.

44:48.610 --> 44:50.109
You don’t need me.

44:50.109 --> 44:53.720
Its like one enlightened light can enlighten
another light.

44:53.720 --> 44:58.180
Like that we can have so many people who can
get realisation.

44:58.180 --> 45:20.180
So may God bless you and may God give you
self realisation.

45:20.180 --> 45:42.859
I like to have questions from you if possible.

45:42.859 --> 45:45.700
Q: ??

45:45.700 --> 45:59.380
Residual power meaning you see it a little
complicated thing but I will say that the

45:59.380 --> 46:00.380
whole being is created, alright, by three
powers within us.

46:00.380 --> 46:12.720
One is the power on the left hand side which
is the power of desire, another side is the

46:12.720 --> 46:15.010
power of action.

46:15.010 --> 46:19.809
And the third is the power of ascent which
is in the centre.

46:19.809 --> 46:22.109
Now all this has happened.

46:22.109 --> 46:29.859
But still one energy is not being used and
that is the energy of kundalini which is power

46:29.859 --> 46:34.780
of pure desire.

46:34.780 --> 46:38.760
Because according to economics wants are not
sachetable in general.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.670
Today we want to have a chair, tomorrow we
want to have a table, then we want to have

46:41.670 --> 46:46.039
a house, then we want to have something else
and like that goes on.

46:46.039 --> 46:48.869
we are never satisfied.

46:48.869 --> 46:53.630
So the pure desire the power of pure desire
is the kundalini.

46:53.630 --> 46:54.799
What is the pure desire.

46:54.799 --> 46:57.830
Whether you are aware of it or not, subconsciously
or unconsciously whatever you call it; the

46:57.830 --> 47:03.980
pure desire of kundalini is “to be one with
the divine”.

47:03.980 --> 47:08.730
This is the pure desire.

47:08.730 --> 47:14.230
Until you have fulfilled that you will never
be satisfied with yourself.

47:14.230 --> 47:18.730
Because thats how you know the absolute truth.

47:18.730 --> 47:24.430
Thats how you become absolutely above all
these weaknesses that you have.

47:24.430 --> 47:37.260
You become the master of yourself and also
then you jump in the ocean of joy and peace.

47:37.260 --> 47:45.690
No questions.

47:45.690 --> 47:49.910
Good ??.

47:49.910 --> 47:59.780
as I have told you that there are 4000 tapes
and they are available to you.

47:59.780 --> 48:01.880
You can always listen to them.

48:01.880 --> 48:08.000
Only thing that I have not told you, one thing
which is important to know is this yellow

48:08.000 --> 48:14.140
balloon that we have in our head is the balloon
of ego and another one is of the blue is the

48:14.140 --> 48:15.140
balloon of conditionings in us.

48:15.140 --> 48:19.700
The conditionings we have had.

48:19.700 --> 48:27.099
So the kundalini rises she passes through
this crossing point and she sucks in these

48:27.099 --> 48:28.099
two things.

48:28.099 --> 48:32.750
Thats how our karma, our conditionings are
sucked in.

48:32.750 --> 48:39.380
but in childhood when we grow, upto the age
of twelve years these two grow like that and

48:39.380 --> 48:46.000
cover each other and the fontanelle bone area
which is the soft bone in your childhood is

48:46.000 --> 48:49.279
completely closed.

48:49.279 --> 48:54.349
So when the kundalini just sucks in it opens
out.

48:54.349 --> 49:01.450
And when it opens out then the kundalini passes
through your fontanelle bone area and you

49:01.450 --> 49:04.609
can feel cool breeze coming out of your head.

49:04.609 --> 49:07.740
We say its the cool breeze of the holy ghost.

49:07.740 --> 49:16.950
What is the holy ghost also, you have got
almighty and you have got a son; what about

49:16.950 --> 49:24.720
the mother ? She is the holy ghost, she is
the primordial mother who we call , in our

49:24.720 --> 49:26.839
Indian language adishakti.

49:26.839 --> 49:31.339
In all ancient scriptures like Greece – Athena.

49:31.339 --> 49:35.440
Athena , atha in Sanskrit means primordial.

49:35.440 --> 49:41.720
Even here those people who came they call
this river by paramata, is the same.

49:41.720 --> 49:51.309
So this kundalini is the reflection of the
holy ghost, while spirit is the reflection

49:51.309 --> 49:54.000
of the God almighty.

49:54.000 --> 50:00.339
They have to meet and thats how they get realisation.

50:00.339 --> 50:08.839
The fontanelle bone area is opened out and
you can feel the actualisation of baptism.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.039
Its not artificial.

50:10.039 --> 50:13.650
Its actualisation you can feel it, the cool
breeze.

50:13.650 --> 50:17.190
Ofcourse in the Pentecostal you must have
read that you can feel the cool breeze of

50:17.190 --> 50:18.470
the holy ghost.

50:18.470 --> 50:21.119
Thats what you feel on top of your head.

50:21.119 --> 50:26.730
We got photograph where sahaja yogis are sitting
and in the photograph you see the light on

50:26.730 --> 50:27.730
their heads.

50:27.730 --> 50:32.210
And in some of the paintings you must have
seen having light in their head.

50:32.210 --> 50:37.359
In olden times when there was christianity
at the level of gnostics where they, “gna”

50:37.359 --> 50:42.740
also the word comes from the same as gyana
which Shri Krishna has described as gyan marg

50:42.740 --> 50:44.099
(path of knowledge) .

50:44.099 --> 50:52.319
Gyan doesn’t mean through your brain, but
means, again the same bodha which I told you

50:52.319 --> 50:53.319
“gna”.

50:53.319 --> 51:02.450
Same gna is used by Thomas when he described
christianity in his treaties on his way to

51:02.450 --> 51:06.410
India when he wrote all this an put them in
Egypt and which are found out and now you

51:06.410 --> 51:08.440
can get that book as “gnosticis??.

51:08.440 --> 51:14.020
”; important to read because he has ?? all
the ideas of suffering and things .

51:14.020 --> 51:17.269
Is written everything about sahaja yoga.

51:17.269 --> 51:20.260
He said its an experience of the self you
must have.

51:20.260 --> 51:26.500
Like christ has said you have to be born again,
so we certify ourselves.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.619
How can that be.

51:28.619 --> 51:32.140
In sanskrit language a born again person is
called dwijaha mean born again.

51:32.140 --> 51:37.810
And a bird is also called dwija means its
an egg and then it becomes a bird.

51:37.810 --> 51:42.099
In the same way first we are human beings
and then we become saints.

51:42.099 --> 51:44.952
This is the second birth we should have.

51:44.952 --> 51:45.952
But we have to become !.

51:45.952 --> 51:47.930
It’s not just certificate.

51:47.930 --> 51:49.840
So every body things ?? of themeselves.

51:49.840 --> 51:54.539
The other somebody asked me question “Mother,
why there are quarrels among religions?”

51:54.539 --> 51:58.839
Because they are not following what their
originators have told.

51:58.839 --> 52:02.170
They are just following some sort of man made
religion.

52:02.170 --> 52:03.740
That’s why there is problem.

52:03.740 --> 52:08.000
Because all religions are just the same.

52:08.000 --> 52:15.829
Born on tree of life at different times and
these flowers were plucked by people saying

52:15.829 --> 52:19.660
this is mine, this is mine and that’s why
they are fighting.

52:19.660 --> 52:21.279
These are dead flowers.

52:21.279 --> 52:22.800
These are not living flowers.

52:22.800 --> 52:26.589
They come from the same source of spirituality.

52:26.589 --> 52:30.299
Christ has said those who are not against
me are with me.

52:30.299 --> 52:33.220
Who are those ? In four years what could he
do christ.

52:33.220 --> 52:34.220
Its an impossible situation.

52:34.220 --> 52:36.079
How people were cruel to him.

52:36.079 --> 52:45.079
I was struggling with 7 hippies; very well
educated hippies in England for 4 years.

52:45.079 --> 52:46.270
So you can imagine.

52:46.270 --> 52:55.010
I must give full credit to Christ atleast
he could say so many things about reality.

52:55.010 --> 53:11.790
Should we have our realisaton.

53:11.790 --> 53:15.150
(52.

53:15.150 --> 53:38.650
57)
There is some gentelman, another gentleman.

53:38.650 --> 54:05.500
??
I think you are little confused about it.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.540
You haven’t yet seen it what happens.

54:07.540 --> 54:08.540
Alright .

54:08.540 --> 54:12.299
After the experience you talk to me about
it then you will be alright.

54:12.299 --> 54:14.190
A little confused.

54:14.190 --> 54:20.589
You see, to say that, you see I have told
you one light can enlighten another light.

54:20.589 --> 54:21.589
Alright.

54:21.589 --> 54:27.950
In a general way I must say that today’s
sahaja yoga is something very tremendous.

54:27.950 --> 54:30.799
Because it works amass.

54:30.799 --> 54:36.510
Just works out, amass, in thousands of people.

54:36.510 --> 54:43.009
So must be you are also special I must say
or also these are special times and also that

54:43.009 --> 54:46.720
the divine is angcious to give you realisation.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.960
All these three things put together.

54:49.960 --> 54:59.039
But of course, I will tell you how to raise
your kundalini as well as your kundalini will

54:59.039 --> 55:00.039
rise.

55:00.039 --> 55:02.200
It will take hardly ten minutes for the whole
thing.

55:02.200 --> 55:06.310
But one thing is sure, I cannot force on you.

55:06.310 --> 55:08.230
I respect your freedom.

55:08.230 --> 55:10.160
Because you have to get your ultimate freedom.

55:10.160 --> 55:12.289
So I cannot force on you.

55:12.289 --> 55:24.880
You have to ask for it in your own free will.

55:24.880 --> 55:29.359
That’s very important.

55:29.359 --> 55:33.480
It cannot be forced.

55:33.480 --> 55:34.850
Q: ??

55:34.850 --> 55:37.690
That’s what we are going to do.

55:37.690 --> 55:40.980
That’s a very good question.

55:40.980 --> 55:46.089
That’s the best question.

55:46.089 --> 55:48.049
Alright.

55:48.049 --> 55:58.849
So if you are ready then I have to tell you
that there are two conditions.

55:58.849 --> 56:07.650
The first one is that you have to forget the
past in this hall.

56:07.650 --> 56:15.680
Forget that you have done any mistakes or
so called sins.

56:15.680 --> 56:21.859
And, you have to say in your heart that you
are not at all guilty of anything.

56:21.859 --> 56:24.960
If you were guilty of something you have been
in jail.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.750
So you are not guilty.

56:26.750 --> 56:33.500
Afterall you are human beings as I told you
and you are capable of mistakes.

56:33.500 --> 56:42.680
But the divine has great power of forgiveness
and any mistake can be forgiven.

56:42.680 --> 56:51.569
So first thing, first condition is that you
have to respect yourself and forgive yourself

56:51.569 --> 56:55.200
and not to believe at all that you are guilty.

56:55.200 --> 56:59.920
Its very important for self confidence.

56:59.920 --> 57:01.269
Everyone can get realisation.

57:01.269 --> 57:03.790
But firstly one should not feel guilty.

57:03.790 --> 57:04.790
57.

57:04.790 --> 57:05.790
03

57:05.790 --> 57:07.019
Its a myth.

57:07.019 --> 57:09.519
Alright.

57:09.519 --> 57:16.670
Second myth is that we cannot forgive some
other people.

57:16.670 --> 57:21.330
Some people say its very difficult to forgive
others.

57:21.330 --> 57:25.619
But whether we forgive or don’t forgive,
we don’t do anything.

57:25.619 --> 57:34.549
What do we do? But if we don’t forgive then
it starts working in our minds, working in

57:34.549 --> 57:38.890
our temperament and we play into wrong hands
unnecessarily.

57:38.890 --> 57:45.710
While the person who wants to punish us is
perfectly alright, in good health.

57:45.710 --> 57:48.329
So this is a myth and we are playing into
wrong hands.

57:48.329 --> 57:51.299
So we have to say I forgive everyone.

57:51.299 --> 57:56.329
Now you don’t have to think whom you have
to forgive, what wrong he has done, how far

57:56.329 --> 57:57.640
you have to go, nothing.

57:57.640 --> 58:01.690
You just in general you have to say “I forgive
everyone”.

58:01.690 --> 58:07.309
Is more important in place like Canberra.

58:07.309 --> 58:15.809
Because I know in a place like this, this
centre [pointing at agya] works very hard;

58:15.809 --> 58:18.670
thinks thinks thinks too much, this centre.

58:18.670 --> 58:25.019
And is important to stop thinking, you have
to say “Alright I forgive.

58:25.019 --> 58:26.019
I forgive.

58:26.019 --> 58:27.880
Just go on forgiving.

58:27.880 --> 58:30.269
And you get to it”.

58:30.269 --> 58:34.519
Say I, I am quiet used people who are bureaucrats.

58:34.519 --> 58:37.359
I know there situation very well.

58:37.359 --> 58:43.589
I know them better than any body else I should
say.

58:43.589 --> 58:48.160
So I have to tell you really very frankly.

58:48.160 --> 58:51.950
Forgive everyone and also you know that you
are not guilty.

58:51.950 --> 58:57.880
Because they have always told you have done
this mistake that mistake, and also out of

58:57.880 --> 59:00.859
jealousy or whatever it is people trouble
them.

59:00.859 --> 59:02.990
Then they cannot forgive.

59:02.990 --> 59:05.319
So better forgive everyone.

59:05.319 --> 59:12.619
Forget everything and be here absolutely free
from all those nonsensical worries.

59:12.619 --> 59:15.510
Will be a good idea.

59:15.510 --> 59:21.829
Only by doing these things you will be completely
free I tell you to receive your realisation.

59:21.829 --> 59:25.329
We have to take help from the mother earth.

59:25.329 --> 59:29.880
For that we have to take out our shoes, will
help us a lot.

59:29.880 --> 59:37.530
Just take out your shoes.

59:37.530 --> 59:46.599
Some people who want to come further can come
further also.

59:46.599 --> 59:50.490
Its very far away.

59:50.490 --> 59:52.440
Its alright.

59:52.440 --> 59:58.269
Makes no difference wherever you are.

59:58.269 --> 01:00:06.000
And if I said something that makes you feel
guilty, forget my lecture also.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.890
Is important.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:14.250
So that means in short that we have to be
very pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:17.390
“Prasannachitta, in Sanskrit its said “Prasannachitta”.

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:20.539
Must be pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

01:00:20.539 --> 01:00:28.509
You have to put both your feet little away
from each other because they represents two

01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:29.509
energies.

01:00:29.509 --> 01:00:32.119
So put them on two sides.

01:00:32.119 --> 01:00:35.789
Children will get realisation without doing
anything.

01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:37.880
They are very good.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.980
They are not complicated.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980
Alright.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.599
He will show you what is to be done.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:51.079
You can see that and after that we will take
out our spectacles and close our eyes and

01:00:51.079 --> 01:00:55.619
then the real awakening will take place.

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:59.109
Please put your left hand towards me.

01:00:59.109 --> 01:01:00.109
Like this.

01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:07.940
This represent, putting the left hand represents
nothing but the desire to get self realisation.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:14.690
And the right hand you have to use for action
and we have to place it at different points

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:19.099
on the left hand side on our centres.

01:01:19.099 --> 01:01:21.359
So first we put it on our heart.

01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:25.480
Thats very important because in the heart
resides spirit.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.509
Again I will say in the place like Canberra
is important.

01:01:30.509 --> 01:01:35.180
Because they work so hard, think so hard that
the heart becomes weak.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.720
Its better to press your hand on your heart.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:45.420
You should put under your coat will be a better
idea.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.420
And.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:54.619
Now take down your hand into the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:01:54.619 --> 01:01:57.960
This is the centre of your mastery.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:05.980
This is made by many great teachers, masters,
sadgurus.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:11.779
And we have to awaken it so that we become
masters of that.

01:02:11.779 --> 01:02:16.119
Then you take down your hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen.

01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:18.770
Lower portion of your abdomen.

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:20.890
And press it hard.

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:31.869
Now this is a special centre for pure knowledge
which has to manifest on your central nervous

01:02:31.869 --> 01:02:32.869
system.

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:37.029
Then we take back our hand in the upper portion
of our abdomen.

01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:43.049
Then take it on our heart.

01:02:43.049 --> 01:02:48.880
Now this important is that put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880
From the front.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880
Not from the back side.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.829
Now this centre is very important because
this is the centre which catches or get spoilt

01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:58.509
when we feel guilty.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:01.029
Turn your head to your right.

01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:02.289
Its very important.

01:03:02.289 --> 01:03:09.339
And this centre when is spoilt you get diseases
like spondylitis, angina, all kinds of funny

01:03:09.339 --> 01:03:15.269
diseases, with the lethargic lung and lethargic
heart.

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:21.490
Now you take your right hand put it across
your forehead.

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:23.609
Like this.

01:03:23.609 --> 01:03:27.420
And put down your head as much as you can.

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.539
And press it hard.

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:32.609
On both the sides.

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:39.779
This is the centre for forgiving others.

01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:48.740
Now take back your hand say way back side
of your head and push back your head, as much

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.109
as possible.

01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:58.960
This is the centre for asking the divine to
forgive you.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.480
Now here you don’t have to feel guilty.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.690
You don’t have to count the mistakes you
have committed.

01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:06.490
For your own satisfaction.

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:09.460
You to ask the divine to forgive you.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.910
Then you have to stretch your hand, right
hand like this.

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:21.089
The palm is stretched properly and the centre
o f the palm is put on the fontanelle bone

01:04:21.089 --> 01:04:26.329
area which was a soft bone on top of your
head.

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:29.510
And now its to be pressed.

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:31.630
Put down your head.

01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:37.690
This is important now that you push back your
fingers and thumb fully.

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:38.690
Please.

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:45.940
Push them back properly so that there is a
good pressure on your scalp.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:51.170
And now move your scalp slowly seven times.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:05:08.589
Move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:11.529
Clockwise slowly with the pressure.

01:05:11.529 --> 01:05:14.009
Thats all we have to do.

01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:15.009
Thats all.

01:05:15.009 --> 01:05:17.609
Nothing else needed to be done.

01:05:17.609 --> 01:05:18.609
Thats all.

01:05:18.609 --> 01:05:21.000
Take out your glasses if you want.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.329
If there is anything tight near your neck,
little bit loosen it.

01:05:24.329 --> 01:05:30.869
If there is anything tight on your waist,
you can loosen it a little bit.

01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:32.700
And you have to be relaxed.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.849
You don’t have to bend forward or backwards
too much.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.450
Sit in a proper straight manner.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:39.450
Thats all.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:43.020
Now remember to put your feet on both the
sides.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:50.249
And put your left hand towards me please and
the right hand now is to go on the heart.

01:05:50.249 --> 01:05:56.440
Now please close your eyes and don’t open
them till I tell you.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.640
That’s all.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:04.740
Now here when you put your hand on your heart
where resides the spirit you have to ask me

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.779
a very important question.

01:06:06.779 --> 01:06:14.349
You may call me “Shree Mataji or Mother”
which ever suits you and this question is

01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:17.599
like as if you are asking a computer.

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:25.060
So now ask the question in your heart not
openly, not loudly, but in your hear; “Mother

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.940
Am I the Spirit?”.

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.800
Ask this question three times.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.890
“Mother Am I the Spirit?”.

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:39.410
Ask this question three times.

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:57.059
Now take down your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:06:57.059 --> 01:07:02.660
One must know that if you are the spirit you
become your own guide.

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:06.599
In the light of the spirit you know the absolute
truth.

01:07:06.599 --> 01:07:09.380
So you become your own master.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:14.190
So now ask a second question “Mother Am
I my own Master?”.

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:16.329
Ask this question three times.

01:07:16.329 --> 01:07:30.970
“Mother Am I the Spirit?”.

01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:37.619
As I told you I respect your freedom and I
cannot cross over it.

01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:44.440
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.069
You have to ask for it.

01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:53.140
Now put right hand in the lower portion of
your abdomen on the left hand side and ask

01:07:53.140 --> 01:08:04.750
me “Mother please give me pure knowledge”,
“Mother please give me pure knowledge”;

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:07.749
please ask this six times.

01:08:07.749 --> 01:08:11.950
Six times because this centre has got six
petals.

01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:18.400
“please Mother give me pure knowledge”.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:26.810
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the
kundalini starts ascending.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:34.540
So we have to now nourish our upper centres
with with our self confidence.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:41.540
So now raise your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on your left hand

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:42.540
side.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.880
And here press it hard.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:54.869
And say with full confidence ten times, because
this centre has got ten petals.

01:08:54.869 --> 01:09:01.299
Ten times “Mother I am my own master”.

01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:03.500
Say it with full confidence.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:18.150
“Mother I am my own master”.

01:09:18.150 --> 01:09:34.529
Now we have to know that the divine is the
ocean of knowledge and love.

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:37.350
Pure love.

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:42.609
It is the ocean of peace and bliss.

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:51.299
But above all it is a very powerful open ocean
of forgiveness.

01:09:51.299 --> 01:10:02.420
So we cannot do any mistake which cannot be
dissolved by this powerful ocean of forgiveness.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:09.300
So please raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.980
Push it back as much as you can towards the
spinal cord.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.730
And now put your head towards right.

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:18.820
Now here with full confidence you have to
say, sixteen times “Mother I am not guilty

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.820
at all” .

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.469
Please say sixteen times.

01:10:21.469 --> 01:10:25.110
“Mother I am not guilty at all” .

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:26.679
Please say sixteen times.

01:10:26.679 --> 01:10:37.110
Again I will tell you it is a myth when you
say “I cannot forgive people”.

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:47.050
Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything.

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:58.790
But if you don’t forgive you really torture
yourself for nothing at all.

01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:06.290
So please remember that it is all a myth and
you are not going to carry on with it anymore.

01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:08.290
This is very important.

01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:17.480
Because this centre is very constricted one
and you have to help your kundalini to rise

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.610
through it by really, heartily forgiving everyone.

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:32.070
So now please raise your forehead across and
please put your hand in such a manner that

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.560
you can press it on both the sides.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:44.610
And now put down your head fully and here
please say “Mother I forgive everyone”.

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:47.860
Now its not necessary how many times.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.570
You to have really say from your heart.

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:53.469
If you don’t say it from your heart, this
centre wouldn’t open otherwise.

01:11:53.469 --> 01:12:01.330
So please I request you again and again to
say “Mother I really forgive everyone”.

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:07.390
Now don’t think whom you have to forgive,
what mistakes they have committed.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:21.380
Just say it out of your understanding that
your realisation is higher than anything else.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:31.050
Now take back your hand on the backside of
your head and push back your head as far as

01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:32.050
possible.

01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:40.730
Now this is the centre for you to ask for
forgiveness for your own satisfaction.

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:47.540
Without feeling guilty, without counting your
mistakes you just have to say “Oh Divine,

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:55.930
if I have done any mistakes, please forgive
me”.

01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:59.940
For your satisfaction.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:05.280
Don’t count your mistakes.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:27.139
Now stretch your hand and put the centre of
your palm on the soft bone which is called

01:13:27.139 --> 01:13:33.469
as the fontanelle bone area.

01:13:33.469 --> 01:13:45.470
Press it hard and move it seven times.

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:49.480
Here again I cannot cross your freedom.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:14:51.719
So please say seven times while moving your
hand “Mother please give me my self realisation”.

01:14:51.719 --> 01:15:07.690
Now please open your eyes and put your hands
like this.

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:16.920
Now put the right hand towards me , like this
and bend your head and see for your self if

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:24.540
there is a cool breeze coming out of the fontanelle
bone area or the soft bone that you had in

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.630
your child hood.

01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:27.280
In sanskrit it is called as brahmarandra.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:34.660
Brahma means the all pervading power, and
randra means the whole in ?? it.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.570
Now see for yourself.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:43.800
The hand should be little away from the head,
above it not on it.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.550
Some people get it very far also.

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:50.830
Now the left hand to be used now.

01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:53.780
Put the left hand towards me, higher like
this.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.180
Bend your head.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:16:06.360
And see for your self if there is a cool breeze
coming out of your head.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.860
Now again the right hand.

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.239
Now see for yourself.

01:16:10.239 --> 01:16:15.659
If there is a cool breeze coming out of your
head once for all.

01:16:15.659 --> 01:16:17.330
Will be higher.

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:18.330
Now.

01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:25.510
Raise your both the hands and push back your
head and ask a question “Mother is this

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:28.030
the cool breeze of the holy ghost.

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:36.170
Mother is this the power of all pervading
divine or Mother is this the paramachaitanya”?

01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:41.659
Ask any one of these question, any one of
these three times in your heart.

01:16:41.659 --> 01:16:42.659
Please ask.

01:16:42.659 --> 01:16:46.790
Push back your head, Push back your head and
the question three times.

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:50.600
Now raise your hands fully.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.600
Fully.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.409
Push back your head.

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:57.460
Push back your head.

01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.510
Don’t miss the point.

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:02.040
Please don’t.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.550
Push back your head.

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:05.980
Push back your head.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.639
Now please bring down your hands.

01:17:09.639 --> 01:17:17.000
Just put the hands towards me and see if you
can be without thoughts.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.219
If there’s no thought.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:28.810
Now those whole felt cool breeze coming out
of the fontanelle bone area, sometimes can

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.890
be hot, some heat comes out; doesn’t matter.

01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:33.400
But feel the breeze.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.900
Or on your fingertips.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:54.150
On their hands please raise both your hands.

01:17:54.150 --> 01:18:26.460
Those who have felt it please raise your hands
both like this, so I will know, like this.

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:27.930
ya.

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:35.260
There are wonderful people here.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:53.610
See, such a lot of you have got realisation.

01:18:53.610 --> 01:19:01.810
God bless you.

01:19:01.810 --> 01:20:04.890
But now this is the beginning.

01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:44.400
You have to come to our centres where ofcourse
you don’t have

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.150
to pay anything.

01:20:46.150 --> 01:21:00.969
But little bit time you have to give and master
it.

01:21:00.969 --> 01:21:13.090
You all can become masters.

01:21:13.090 --> 01:21:28.380
And there wouldn’t be any more problem of
ill health or any problem.

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:48.159
And I would like to meet you all if you want
to meet me just now.

01:21:48.159 --> 01:22:00.320
Because I am going away tomorrow.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:40.670
This is

01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:58.010
the last day of my working Australia.

01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:36.870
And next year I will be again back here.

01:23:36.870 --> 01:24:00.980
But you are all welcome to India.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:25:16.620
We have a nice tour program and also a seminar
at the end of it.

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:59.670
So if it suits you, you

01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:04.770
are welcome to come along.

01:26:04.770 --> 01:28:51.409
You all can come and see me if you like.

01:28:51.409 --> 01:29:25.540
I

01:29:25.540 --> 01:30:45.139
am sorry I am here only for one day.

01:30:45.139 --> 01:33:38.849
But next time I will be here for quiet some
time.

01:33:38.849 --> 01:38:56.969
And I hope I will be able to see you grown
up like a trees now.

01:38:56.969 --> 01:42:18.080
Like a see now you have sprouted now and this
seed has to become a big tree.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:43:22.239
May God bless you.

01:43:22.239 --> 01:44:10.360
God bless you.
