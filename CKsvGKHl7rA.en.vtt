01:08.690 --> 01:12.496
ï»¿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

01:13.971 --> 01:17.775
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

01:18.350 --> 01:22.486
Iâ€™ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

01:22.670 --> 01:28.693
then I realised that today is a very good time

01:28.893 --> 01:37.222
according to the calendar; but it is not in the morning,

01:37.423 --> 01:40.822
so it had to be the third day of the moon

01:41.023 --> 01:46.094
and as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

01:46.295 --> 01:48.893
we had to wait till it started. I think,

01:49.094 --> 01:56.293
all these things have happened, of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

01:57.023 --> 02:01.372
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

02:01.576 --> 02:04.751
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

02:04.951 --> 02:07.643
and we don't have to worry about the timing;

02:07.843 --> 02:10.347
only when it's a formal function or something,

02:10.547 --> 02:14.995
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

02:15.195 --> 02:18.489
So we have to be present there at right time,

02:18.690 --> 02:22.232
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

02:22.432 --> 02:27.237
and we should move in our own way.

02:30.880 --> 02:41.491
Now for our travel and this tour, we have to realise

02:41.692 --> 02:47.443
that we are here to achieve

02:47.644 --> 02:52.889
a certain amount of height in our detachment,

02:53.694 --> 03:05.237
we have to rise into the realm of our state,

03:05.438 --> 03:08.575
while the circumstances around us,

03:08.775 --> 03:16.239
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

03:16.439 --> 03:22.124
or biased, or we should not react to them,

03:22.325 --> 03:29.445
on the contrary we should try to rise above that

03:29.646 --> 03:36.553
if there are no events of mishaps.

03:37.569 --> 03:42.633
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

03:43.899 --> 03:49.610
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

03:49.811 --> 03:53.259
we have to see the obstructions.

03:53.284 --> 04:01.564
For example, if there is the flow of the water going on

04:02.844 --> 04:05.362
and it is smoothly moving,

04:05.562 --> 04:10.347
there's no happening as you call the gatarna,

04:10.547 --> 04:15.458
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

04:15.758 --> 04:18.042
then the water splashes against it,

04:18.242 --> 04:24.284
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

04:24.484 --> 04:32.875
this is the sign of Divine surmounting all the difficulties

04:33.076 --> 04:37.107
that are supposed to be there.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.664
Now we are proceeding to Puna

04:40.864 --> 04:45.010
and where we will be having a proper session

04:45.210 --> 04:47.518
also for marriages and all that,

04:47.718 --> 04:50.815
we will have to take a firm decision,

04:51.015 --> 04:55.240
I must speak about it today,

04:55.441 --> 05:00.616
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

05:00.816 --> 05:05.528
If you have certain concepts

05:05.728 --> 05:12.814
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

05:14.722 --> 05:17.607
because that's not found in Indian character,

05:17.802 --> 05:21.540
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

05:21.839 --> 05:25.092
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

05:25.292 --> 05:31.834
it's a trick of the mind that wants to play tricks with others and enjoys,

05:32.034 --> 05:35.150
it is a sign of ego.

05:35.351 --> 05:41.667
Absolutely a sign of ego and then you start playing games,

05:41.867 --> 05:45.461
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no",

05:45.662 --> 05:48.806
you go on enjoying those games

05:49.006 --> 05:51.612
and later on you play into it so much that your marriages

05:51.812 --> 05:54.323
can never be happy or successful,

05:54.523 --> 05:57.820
that means you are not yet matured for marriage.

05:58.021 --> 06:00.313
For marriage you are to be matured.

06:00.513 --> 06:03.329
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

06:03.529 --> 06:07.224
that you have had no training at all,

06:08.351 --> 06:11.500
parents have never told you how to behave

06:11.701 --> 06:14.642
towards your husband, towards your wife,

06:14.842 --> 06:17.197
how to make a marriage successful,

06:17.397 --> 06:20.330
that is a very important event

06:20.529 --> 06:26.874
and that we should try to establish ourselves in the marriage system,

06:27.075 --> 06:34.124
instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

06:34.325 --> 06:38.281
we miss the point, who is the loser?

06:38.481 --> 06:42.047
If you go on playing tricks like this

06:42.247 --> 06:46.386
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

06:46.587 --> 06:50.324
whatever type of marriages you'll have,

06:50.525 --> 06:53.421
you can never be happy. Now in the west, as you know,

06:53.621 --> 06:59.153
I lead another life also and every person I have met,

06:59.354 --> 07:01.933
every person whatever country they may come,

07:02.133 --> 07:07.230
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

07:08.399 --> 07:12.691
it seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

07:13.130 --> 07:15.674
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

07:15.874 --> 07:18.947
and they have funny miserable faces,

07:19.147 --> 07:24.374
they don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

07:24.582 --> 07:27.491
or something has really gone wrong with them.

07:27.602 --> 07:30.783
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

07:30.808 --> 07:33.514
because they have missed the point,

07:33.714 --> 07:37.228
marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

07:37.429 --> 07:47.855
Supposing one gives you ambrosia, Amrut as they call it

07:48.055 --> 07:53.594
and then you start playing trick with it. Who is the loser?

07:54.360 --> 08:01.447
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

08:01.998 --> 08:07.629
and enjoy that love, basically if something is very wrong,

08:08.113 --> 08:13.735
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

08:13.760 --> 08:17.831
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up,

08:18.031 --> 08:20.066
you can change your wife, change your husband,

08:20.266 --> 08:24.233
no problem, but there must be some reason behind it,

08:24.434 --> 08:30.146
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

08:30.346 --> 08:32.286
I'll try my level best to tell you,

08:32.486 --> 08:35.752
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

08:35.953 --> 08:40.455
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

08:40.656 --> 08:42.599
when it comes to the ego part,

08:42.799 --> 08:46.541
they themselves cannot enjoy, dog in the manger policy,

08:46.742 --> 08:50.380
dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

08:50.405 --> 08:55.096
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this,

08:55.121 --> 08:59.765
neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy

08:59.965 --> 09:03.076
and when such stupid couples are there,

09:03.276 --> 09:06.087
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

09:06.112 --> 09:08.901
talking to them, asking them,

09:08.926 --> 09:12.506
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

09:12.706 --> 09:15.306
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

09:15.331 --> 09:18.949
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

09:19.150 --> 09:23.905
Actually what have I to gain out of it? This nobody tries to understand,

09:24.326 --> 09:26.360
what I am trying is to make you happy

09:26.560 --> 09:28.587
to get you good husbands and good wives,

09:28.787 --> 09:30.884
that you should have good relationships,

09:31.084 --> 09:34.830
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

09:35.031 --> 09:37.652
that we should have a society

09:37.852 --> 09:41.628
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies

09:41.828 --> 09:46.199
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

09:46.399 --> 09:50.564
among ourselves of purity and of holiness,

09:50.765 --> 09:53.370
instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

09:53.570 --> 09:57.772
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

09:57.973 --> 10:02.187
Of course one has to try.

10:03.588 --> 10:06.488
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

10:06.688 --> 10:11.400
how can I go on clipping them back?

10:11.601 --> 10:16.932
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

10:17.132 --> 10:21.242
you have the enjoyment of it. Now if it's a, say,

10:21.443 --> 10:27.499
a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example,

10:27.700 --> 10:32.159
but then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

10:32.459 --> 10:37.806
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

10:38.006 --> 10:42.338
and all sorts of nonsense that going on.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.884
So I again say that, now we are going to Puna

10:47.909 --> 10:52.019
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed,

10:52.220 --> 10:54.954
if you go on like this there's no end to it,

10:55.154 --> 10:57.951
also those people who come for marriages

10:58.151 --> 11:02.525
and deny it twice, third time I don't ask them,

11:02.726 --> 11:07.157
because it's a joke going on.

11:08.670 --> 11:12.954
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

11:13.154 --> 11:16.519
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

11:16.719 --> 11:21.503
Yesterday you saw that, you have different conditionings,

11:21.703 --> 11:25.086
different styles, different everything,

11:25.662 --> 11:28.939
heights different, ages different, faces different,

11:28.964 --> 11:32.302
aptitudes different.

11:32.503 --> 11:36.912
So combine all these things, so very difficult,

11:37.112 --> 11:40.115
sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

11:40.315 --> 11:42.655
them better to give you a simple woman,

11:42.854 --> 11:46.060
so that your little pressure is reduced, you can share

11:46.261 --> 11:50.183
with her but if you are equally educated people,

11:50.384 --> 11:55.215
then both the heads may be...

12:01.756 --> 12:06.540
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

12:06.740 --> 12:09.404
but somehow or other you can defy

12:09.605 --> 12:12.185
and you try to defy it, alright doesnt matter,

12:12.386 --> 12:15.777
but who is the loser is the point,

12:15.978 --> 12:18.886
today I had to speak to you about this, because in Sahaj

12:19.087 --> 12:22.918
we have to take the way it comes as it comes,

12:23.318 --> 12:27.094
whatever comes in our way we should take it.

12:27.294 --> 12:29.705
We should not sort of say, I have fallen in love.

12:29.905 --> 12:35.311
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

12:42.078 --> 12:46.675
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

12:46.755 --> 12:53.666
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

12:54.064 --> 12:56.724
or something absurd. So many people have told me,

12:56.924 --> 12:59.247
"Mother I have not fallen in love with her."

12:59.447 --> 13:02.101
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch,

13:02.301 --> 13:09.294
or you may fall into some river of something like that.

13:09.495 --> 13:14.674
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

13:19.440 --> 13:26.127
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

13:26.941 --> 13:32.143
if it means that you have felt the love,

13:32.343 --> 13:40.641
or if it means you have the sensitivity of feeling the love

13:40.666 --> 13:43.653
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

13:43.861 --> 13:48.352
but this falling in love business has been going on and on and on.

13:48.552 --> 13:50.491
Now I would request you that in Sahaja Yoga

13:50.691 --> 13:55.675
we cancel this terminology.

13:57.197 --> 14:03.552
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga,

14:03.753 --> 14:07.569
you have chance for one month to decide for yourself

14:07.769 --> 14:12.996
and to find out for yourself. Little bit adjustments and understanding

14:13.197 --> 14:18.231
can create such a beautiful world for you.

14:18.432 --> 14:23.701
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

14:23.901 --> 14:28.118
suddenly you're alright I find, at the spur of the moment

14:28.143 --> 14:32.322
I find suddenly you say: "No", I say: "What's this?"

14:32.347 --> 14:34.916
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

14:34.941 --> 14:39.045
it has turned round? One can understand a horse,

14:39.246 --> 14:42.248
but I can't understand human beings.

14:42.449 --> 14:48.387
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

14:48.588 --> 14:53.238
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

14:53.438 --> 14:56.568
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

14:56.768 --> 14:59.010
from all over the country,

14:59.211 --> 15:02.291
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

15:02.483 --> 15:05.932
that has gone rotten, while I'm boasting to everyone

15:05.965 --> 15:08.610
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

15:08.635 --> 15:11.401
I know it's not true,

15:11.426 --> 15:15.976
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

15:16.276 --> 15:20.908
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

15:21.108 --> 15:25.052
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

15:25.253 --> 15:29.143
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

15:29.343 --> 15:33.955
to bring about these events.

15:35.118 --> 15:37.770
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

15:37.970 --> 15:43.189
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

15:43.390 --> 15:46.454
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

15:46.654 --> 15:48.829
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga, after that, we are

15:49.029 --> 15:53.045
enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

15:53.246 --> 15:56.876
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost,

15:57.076 --> 16:00.524
that also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

16:00.724 --> 16:04.235
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

16:04.435 --> 16:08.443
its such a headache.

16:10.228 --> 16:14.040
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

16:14.241 --> 16:18.183
because I think there's no problem at all,

16:18.208 --> 16:23.021
only thing you have decided not to enjoy the game.

16:24.623 --> 16:27.638
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food

16:27.663 --> 16:30.327
you can put some quinine on your tongue

16:30.528 --> 16:36.337
and then say I don't like the food, something like that. It's absurd.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.840
So try to help me in this,

16:39.041 --> 16:42.389
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

16:42.589 --> 16:44.921
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

16:45.128 --> 16:50.401
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

16:52.230 --> 16:56.373
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

16:56.574 --> 17:00.877
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

17:01.078 --> 17:03.370
What are you?

17:03.570 --> 17:06.950
What is your education? What is your intellect?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.803
What do you expect from another person?

17:10.652 --> 17:14.342
How much money you have got? How much money the other person has got?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.669
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself,

17:16.870 --> 17:21.361
to begin with, then compare.

17:21.562 --> 17:28.106
But the greatest thing you have to think about, how many vibrations you have?

17:30.146 --> 17:32.721
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

17:32.922 --> 17:35.230
You are married for your ascent.

17:35.430 --> 17:41.880
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

17:42.080 --> 17:44.680
then your should not unnecessarily boast

17:44.880 --> 17:47.573
of nonsensical gross things;

17:47.774 --> 17:53.011
the person is much subtler, make yourself that,

17:53.212 --> 17:57.270
whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

17:58.978 --> 18:02.345
but I just say that see for yourself: where are you?

18:02.389 --> 18:05.595
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

18:05.796 --> 18:08.080
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

18:08.280 --> 18:12.261
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

18:12.462 --> 18:16.020
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

18:16.220 --> 18:19.622
we have to work, we have to save that person,

18:19.822 --> 18:24.919
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

18:25.120 --> 18:31.144
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

18:32.383 --> 18:35.018
I think you will understand the seriousness,

18:35.218 --> 18:37.510
this is the most important work

18:37.710 --> 18:42.260
that ever happened on this Earth so far,

18:42.460 --> 18:45.031
your marriages are very important

18:45.232 --> 18:50.290
and you have seen the photographs with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

18:50.490 --> 18:53.728
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

18:53.928 --> 18:56.073
they all were present in your marriage

18:56.274 --> 18:59.312
and how they were giving you tributes

18:59.513 --> 19:03.974
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

19:04.175 --> 19:08.436
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

19:08.836 --> 19:11.557
But if you are not a seeker and if you are not seeking

19:11.581 --> 19:14.688
your higher ascent, then you go into

19:14.795 --> 19:18.537
nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

19:18.564 --> 19:22.018
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

19:22.219 --> 19:26.861
don't think too much of yourself, another note of caution,

19:27.062 --> 19:31.963
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

19:32.163 --> 19:34.667
so don't get mad.

19:34.867 --> 19:38.136
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

19:38.436 --> 19:41.588
It's done in India to create better relationships,

19:41.788 --> 19:44.572
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

19:44.772 --> 19:50.389
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

19:50.589 --> 19:53.410
so better be careful. It's a custom here

19:53.611 --> 19:58.791
to look after the son-in-law, to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

19:59.341 --> 20:04.688
Now it is ingrained from ages, it doesn't mean that you are God,

20:04.713 --> 20:08.500
or you are in some superlative condition.

20:09.812 --> 20:14.350
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

20:14.551 --> 20:20.339
they look after the daughter-in-law, or the son-in-law, normally.

20:20.540 --> 20:25.051
And you should not carry away ideas,

20:25.210 --> 20:27.626
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

20:27.826 --> 20:31.000
I have seen, they don't care. Once that they are married,

20:31.025 --> 20:34.683
they are finished, it's not so, so please be careful.

20:34.708 --> 20:37.489
When you are marrying Indians, you will find the parents

20:37.514 --> 20:39.851
will quite pamper you, look after you,

20:40.051 --> 20:43.533
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

20:43.733 --> 20:49.034
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

20:49.235 --> 20:55.089
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

20:55.289 --> 20:57.238
and should not get pampered, on the contrary should feel

20:57.438 --> 21:01.062
blissful about it, but when it is done I have seen suddenly

21:01.262 --> 21:05.087
they go off and they think no end of themselves,

21:05.288 --> 21:08.057
their value system goes off.

21:08.257 --> 21:11.799
It's because, so far we have had no education,

21:11.999 --> 21:15.449
no training about marriages.

21:16.717 --> 21:19.799
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

21:19.999 --> 21:23.320
Indians also you see, expect you to understand

21:23.521 --> 21:25.481
their customs sometimes too much,

21:25.682 --> 21:27.935
for example yesterday the garlands were given,

21:28.136 --> 21:30.530
at the time when the garlands were given,

21:30.730 --> 21:33.428
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

21:33.628 --> 21:36.429
but some of you took the garland put it you,

21:36.630 --> 21:40.328
they regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

21:40.528 --> 21:43.609
but it is so, so when we are in India

21:43.809 --> 21:46.307
we have to understand Indians,

21:46.507 --> 21:50.898
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

21:51.081 --> 21:53.413
For example in the west you just go on saying, thank you,

21:53.614 --> 21:57.193
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry,

21:57.393 --> 21:59.585
it is so confusing sometimes.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.559
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

22:02.760 --> 22:06.779
I mean, I sometimes shake with nine hundred people at a time,

22:06.979 --> 22:11.112
and while they are going back again nine hundred people.

22:11.313 --> 22:14.114
I think namaste is a better idea.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.192
See to shake hands with every sort of a person,

22:17.217 --> 22:21.007
you'll catch from every one, but is a custom,

22:21.208 --> 22:24.211
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

22:24.411 --> 22:29.016
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

22:29.216 --> 22:33.453
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

22:33.654 --> 22:36.149
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

22:36.349 --> 22:39.936
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

22:40.137 --> 22:42.707
and the ladies don't take garlands on their,

22:42.907 --> 22:45.605
you see, because any man cannot garland a lady,

22:45.805 --> 22:48.652
because is only husband has the right,

22:48.852 --> 22:51.250
see, so anyone won't garland,

22:51.451 --> 22:55.295
or a son can garland the mother, but any man

22:55.496 --> 23:00.806
cannot garland any lady who is of a younger age,

23:00.877 --> 23:04.497
or who is not yet married and even if married,

23:04.522 --> 23:08.245
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright,

23:08.446 --> 23:12.366
so these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

23:12.566 --> 23:16.767
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street,

23:16.967 --> 23:21.124
even if the leaders here are garlanded

23:21.324 --> 23:24.417
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

23:24.618 --> 23:29.618
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out,

23:30.975 --> 23:34.064
so these are few customs which must be understood

23:34.264 --> 23:36.765
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic,

23:36.966 --> 23:39.883
whatever is illogical we can give up,

23:40.083 --> 23:44.342
whatever is logical we have to lake it and understand it.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.711
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

23:47.919 --> 23:49.862
children also started laughing, because they thought

23:50.063 --> 23:52.394
they are garlanding themselves.

23:52.595 --> 23:57.380
it's like doing Aarti to yourself, you know,

23:57.580 --> 23:59.762
amounts to that.

23:59.962 --> 24:03.033
So you can understand why they were laughing.

24:03.234 --> 24:08.635
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

24:08.836 --> 24:12.511
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

24:12.711 --> 24:16.417
yesterday was, Left Vishuddhi was too much.

24:17.638 --> 24:20.580
Perhaps in the morning I said you were allvery late

24:20.605 --> 24:23.765
for the formal programme, I don't know,

24:23.965 --> 24:27.768
whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

24:27.969 --> 24:30.137
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

24:30.337 --> 24:33.270
in any formal programme, but it seems such a

24:33.471 --> 24:36.652
Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

24:36.853 --> 24:38.932
and I just knew what it was.

24:39.133 --> 24:43.297
So Mother says to you things which should not hurt you in any way

24:43.498 --> 24:46.774
and you should not take it that seriously but should understand that

24:46.975 --> 24:49.084
next time we should not do so, otherwise

24:49.285 --> 24:53.050
you are all wonderful people. You are beautiful people,

24:53.344 --> 24:55.266
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

24:55.442 --> 24:59.153
but I am very proud of you. I'm extremely proud of you,

24:59.178 --> 25:01.428
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

25:01.629 --> 25:05.276
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

25:05.476 --> 25:09.039
I don't know what should I do.

25:09.240 --> 25:13.024
So not to take things that seriously.

25:13.225 --> 25:16.579
There's nothing so much wrong.

25:16.779 --> 25:20.072
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

25:20.272 --> 25:23.068
it's for our good, for our enjoyment,

25:23.093 --> 25:26.123
everything to increase your enjoyment.

25:26.163 --> 25:30.516
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

25:30.632 --> 25:35.186
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

25:35.504 --> 25:38.504
all this is done.

25:38.528 --> 25:43.298
