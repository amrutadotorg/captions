00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:01.962
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:17.628
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:22.339
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:28.373
then I realised that today is a very good

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:31.377
time according to the calendar;

00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:36.420
but it is not in the morning,

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:41.397
so it had to be the third day of the moon.

00:01:41.628 --> 00:01:46.732
And as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.746
we had to wait till it started.

00:01:48.997 --> 00:01:51.599
I think, all these things have happened,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.512
of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

00:01:56.876 --> 00:02:01.225
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.775
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.841
and we don't have to worry about the timing.

00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:10.726
Only when it's a formal function or something,

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:15.413
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:18.950
So we have to be present there at right time,

00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:22.929
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.090
and we should move in our own way.

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:36.900
Now for our travel

00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:41.280
and this tour, we have to realise

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.930
that we are here to achieve

00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:54.828
a certain amount of height in our detachment.

00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:59.836
We have to rise into the realm

00:03:00.037 --> 00:03:05.772
of our state,

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:10.535
while the circumstances around us,

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:17.816
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.285
or biased, or we should not react to them,

00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:30.708
On the contrary we should try to rise above that.

00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:37.196
If there are no events of mishaps.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.486
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:50.488
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.656
we have to see the obstructions.

00:03:53.857 --> 00:03:56.408
For example,

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.617
if there is the flow of the water going on

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.497
and it is smoothly moving,

00:04:05.698 --> 00:04:10.748
there's no happening as you call the ghatana,

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:15.693
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.693
then the water splashes against it,

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:24.138
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:30.780
this is the sign of Divine

00:04:31.068 --> 00:04:37.573
surmounting all the difficulties that are supposed to be there.

00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:41.607
Now we are proceeding to Pune

00:04:41.808 --> 00:04:46.325
and where we will be having a proper session

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:48.987
also for marriages and all that.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:52.371
We will have to take a firm decision.

00:04:52.572 --> 00:04:56.783
I must speak about it today,

00:04:57.037 --> 00:05:02.353
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:07.062
If you have certain concepts

00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:13.476
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:17.460
because that's not found in Indian character,

00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:21.393
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:25.343
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

00:05:25.544 --> 00:05:27.620
it's a trick of the mind

00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:31.360
that wants to play tricks with others

00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:35.322
and enjoys, it is a sign of ego.

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:38.049
Absolutely a sign of ego

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.053
and then you start playing games,

00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:45.986
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no".

00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:49.372
You go on enjoying those games

00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:52.031
and later on you play into it so much

00:05:52.232 --> 00:05:55.111
that your marriages can never be happy or successful.

00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:58.633
That means you are not yet matured for marriage.

00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:01.302
For marriage you are to be matured.

00:06:01.503 --> 00:06:04.456
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

00:06:04.657 --> 00:06:08.087
that you have had no training at all.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.502
Parents have never told you how to behave

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:14.705
towards your husband, towards your wife,

00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:17.344
how to make a marriage successful.

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:20.665
That is a very important event

00:06:20.872 --> 00:06:23.456
and that we should try

00:06:23.657 --> 00:06:27.284
to establish ourselves in the marriage system.

00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:34.602
Instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

00:06:34.975 --> 00:06:38.758
we miss the point, who is the loser?

00:06:39.242 --> 00:06:42.745
If you go on playing tricks like this

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.869
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.851
whatever you may do, whatever type of marriages you'll have,

00:06:51.597 --> 00:06:53.612
you can never be happy.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:57.629
Now in the west, as you know, I lead another life also

00:06:57.843 --> 00:07:00.466
and every person I have met,

00:07:00.704 --> 00:07:03.387
every person whatever country they may come,

00:07:03.588 --> 00:07:07.906
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

00:07:08.252 --> 00:07:12.769
It seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:15.527
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:19.020
and they have funny miserable faces.

00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:24.227
They don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:27.055
or something has really gone wrong with them.

00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:30.636
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:33.902
because they have missed the point.

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:37.809
Marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.621
Supposing one gives you ambrose...,

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:47.715
ambrosia. "Amrut", as they call it

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.874
and then you start playing trick with it.

00:07:52.075 --> 00:07:54.582
Who is the loser?

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.300
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:04.861
and enjoy that love.

00:08:05.062 --> 00:08:07.682
Basically if something is very wrong,

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:13.484
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:17.580
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up.

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:21.815
You can change your wife, change your husband, no problem.

00:08:22.016 --> 00:08:24.351
But there must be some reason behind it,

00:08:24.552 --> 00:08:30.368
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

00:08:30.733 --> 00:08:32.769
I'll try my level best to tell you

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.213
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:41.049
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.419
when it comes to the ego part.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.208
They themselves cannot enjoy. "Dog in the manger" policy.

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:50.608
Dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

00:08:50.809 --> 00:08:54.773
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this.

00:08:55.004 --> 00:08:59.887
Neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy.

00:09:00.088 --> 00:09:03.580
And when such stupid couples are there,

00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.577
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

00:09:06.778 --> 00:09:08.578
talking to them, asking them.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:13.139
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.913
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

00:09:16.114 --> 00:09:19.717
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:21.987
Actually what have I to gain out of it.

00:09:22.188 --> 00:09:23.958
This is nobody will try to understand.

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:26.348
What I am trying is to make you happy,

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:28.618
to get you good husbands and good wives,

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:31.549
that you should have good relationships,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.044
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

00:09:35.245 --> 00:09:37.915
that we should have a society

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:42.082
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies,

00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:47.127
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

00:09:47.328 --> 00:09:51.265
among ourselves of purity and of holiness.

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.635
Instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

00:09:54.836 --> 00:09:58.682
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:02.804
Of course one has to try.

00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:06.449
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:11.253
how can I go on clipping them back?

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:17.242
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

00:10:17.443 --> 00:10:19.449
you have the enjoyment of it.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:27.745
Now if it's a, say, a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example.

00:10:28.325 --> 00:10:32.945
But then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:39.105
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:43.132
and all sorts of nonsense that's going on.

00:10:44.369 --> 00:10:47.737
So I again say that, now we are going to Pune

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:51.770
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.807
If you go on like this there's no end to it,

00:10:55.007 --> 00:10:59.991
also those people who come for marriages and deny it twice,

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:02.595
third time I don't ask them,

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:07.010
because it's a joke going on.

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:13.639
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

00:11:13.862 --> 00:11:17.401
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

00:11:17.602 --> 00:11:19.605
Yesterday you saw that.

00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:22.693
You have different conditionings,

00:11:22.894 --> 00:11:25.899
different styles, different everything,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.450
heights different, ages different, faces different,

00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:32.669
aptitudes different.

00:11:33.383 --> 00:11:37.954
So combine all these things, so very difficult.

00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:41.320
Sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:43.971
them better to give you a simple woman,

00:11:44.172 --> 00:11:47.005
so that your little pressure is reduced,

00:11:47.219 --> 00:11:51.713
you can share with her but if you are equally educated people,

00:11:51.914 --> 00:11:56.252
then both the heads may be...

00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:06.529
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.328
but somehow or other you can defy

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:12.328
and you try to defy it, alright doesn't matter,

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:16.074
but who is the loser is the point.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.587
Today I had to speak to you about this,

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:23.547
because in Sahaj we have to take the way it comes as it comes.

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:27.577
Whatever comes in our way we should take it.

00:12:27.868 --> 00:12:30.643
We should not sort of say: I've fallen in love.

00:12:30.844 --> 00:12:35.554
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.916
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:53.519
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:55.449
or something absurd.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.061
So many people have told me:

00:12:57.262 --> 00:12:59.362
"Mother, I have not fallen in love with her."

00:12:59.563 --> 00:13:05.206
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch, or you may fall,

00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:09.664
fall into some river or something like that.

00:13:09.865 --> 00:13:14.910
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:25.980
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:33.238
if it means that you have felt the love,

00:13:33.476 --> 00:13:40.494
or if it means that you have the sensitivity of feeling the love,

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.513
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:45.983
but this falling in love business

00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:48.205
has been going on and on and on.

00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:49.798
Now I would request you

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:55.156
that in Sahaja Yoga we cancel this terminology.

00:13:57.388 --> 00:14:03.911
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:08.154
You got chance for one month to decide for yourself

00:14:08.355 --> 00:14:10.429
and to find out for yourself.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.676
Little bit adjustments and understanding

00:14:13.877 --> 00:14:18.713
can create such a beautiful world for you.

00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:24.726
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

00:14:24.927 --> 00:14:27.524
suddenly you're alright I find,

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:30.835
at the spur of the moment I find suddenly: "No",

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.082
I say: "What's this?"

00:14:32.283 --> 00:14:34.808
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:36.057
it has turned round?

00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:38.833
One can understand a horse,

00:14:39.034 --> 00:14:42.282
but I can't understand human beings.

00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:47.458
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

00:14:48.728 --> 00:14:53.185
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:53.732 --> 00:14:57.283
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

00:14:57.484 --> 00:14:59.310
from all over the country,

00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:03.134
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.576
that has gone rotten,

00:15:04.777 --> 00:15:06.245
while I'm boasting to everyone

00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:08.287
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

00:15:08.488 --> 00:15:11.201
I know it's not true,

00:15:11.606 --> 00:15:16.324
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:21.243
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.602
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

00:15:25.803 --> 00:15:29.757
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.808
to bring about these events.

00:15:35.026 --> 00:15:38.195
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:43.042
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

00:15:43.574 --> 00:15:46.681
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

00:15:46.882 --> 00:15:48.410
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:48.611 --> 00:15:53.412
after that, we are enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

00:15:53.706 --> 00:15:57.486
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost.

00:15:57.687 --> 00:16:01.205
That also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:05.351
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:08.297
its such a headache.

00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:15.332
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

00:16:15.533 --> 00:16:18.706
because I think there's no problem at all.

00:16:18.907 --> 00:16:22.874
Only thing you have decided not to enjoy anything.

00:16:24.606 --> 00:16:27.491
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food,

00:16:27.692 --> 00:16:30.180
you can put some quinine on your tongue

00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:31.892
and then say I don't like the food,

00:16:32.093 --> 00:16:36.190
something like that. It's absurd.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.693
So try to help me in this,

00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:42.242
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

00:16:42.442 --> 00:16:44.774
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:50.254
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

00:16:52.568 --> 00:16:56.718
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

00:16:57.051 --> 00:17:00.730
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:04.065
What are you?

00:17:04.335 --> 00:17:07.696
What is your education? What is your intellect?

00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.682
What do you expect from another person?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.313
How much money you have got?

00:17:12.514 --> 00:17:14.074
How much money the other person has got?

00:17:14.275 --> 00:17:18.453
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself, to begin with,

00:17:18.654 --> 00:17:21.214
then compare.

00:17:21.631 --> 00:17:23.591
But the greatest thing you have to think about,

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:28.159
how many vibrations you have?

00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:33.047
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

00:17:33.248 --> 00:17:35.741
You are married for your ascent.

00:17:35.942 --> 00:17:42.611
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:48.579
then your should not unnecessarily boast of nonsensical gross things.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.378
The person is much subtler, make use of that.

00:17:54.251 --> 00:17:58.311
Whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:02.041
but I just say that see for yourself," where are you?"

00:18:02.242 --> 00:18:05.683
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:08.306
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

00:18:08.507 --> 00:18:12.114
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

00:18:12.748 --> 00:18:16.418
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:20.175
we have to work, we have to save that person,

00:18:20.376 --> 00:18:25.500
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:30.997
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:34.969
I think you will understand the seriousness,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.550
this is the most important work

00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:42.399
that ever happened on this Earth so far.

00:18:42.653 --> 00:18:45.312
Your marriages are very important

00:18:45.513 --> 00:18:47.286
and you have seen the photographs

00:18:47.487 --> 00:18:50.840
with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:54.307
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:56.682
they all were present in your marriage

00:18:56.883 --> 00:19:00.431
and how they were giving you tributes

00:19:00.632 --> 00:19:05.181
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

00:19:05.382 --> 00:19:09.403
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

00:19:09.934 --> 00:19:11.955
But if you are not a seeker,

00:19:12.156 --> 00:19:14.447
and if you are not seeking your higher ascent,

00:19:14.648 --> 00:19:18.143
then you go into nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:21.861
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

00:19:22.072 --> 00:19:24.166
don't think too much of yourself.

00:19:24.367 --> 00:19:26.841
Another note of caution,

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:32.195
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:34.906
so don't get mad.

00:19:35.144 --> 00:19:38.605
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:42.133
It's done in India to create better relationships,

00:19:42.334 --> 00:19:45.161
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

00:19:45.362 --> 00:19:50.962
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:53.148
so better be careful.

00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:56.192
It's a custom here to look after the son-in-law,

00:19:56.393 --> 00:19:59.798
to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:02.978
Now it is ingrained from ages,

00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:05.570
it doesn't mean that you are God,

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:09.608
or you are in some superlative condition.

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:14.589
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.057
they look after the daughter-in-law,

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:20.630
or the son-in-law, normally.

00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:24.845
And you should not carry away ideas,

00:20:25.063 --> 00:20:27.907
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

00:20:28.108 --> 00:20:29.457
I have seen, they don't care.

00:20:29.658 --> 00:20:33.037
Once that they are married, they are finished, it's not so,

00:20:33.238 --> 00:20:34.536
so please be careful.

00:20:34.737 --> 00:20:36.106
When you are marrying Indians,

00:20:36.307 --> 00:20:40.560
you will find the parents will quite pamper you, look after you,

00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:44.245
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

00:20:44.446 --> 00:20:48.887
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

00:20:49.411 --> 00:20:54.942
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:57.067
and should not get pampered,

00:20:57.268 --> 00:20:59.773
on the contrary should feel blissful about it.

00:20:59.974 --> 00:21:03.579
But when it is done I have seen suddenly they go off

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.690
and they think no end of themselves,

00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:08.789
their value system goes off.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.683
It's because, so far we have had no education,

00:21:12.884 --> 00:21:16.439
no training about marriages.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.895
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

00:21:20.107 --> 00:21:23.623
But indians also you see, expect you to understand

00:21:23.823 --> 00:21:25.492
their customs sometimes too much.

00:21:25.707 --> 00:21:28.255
For example yesterday the garlands were given

00:21:28.456 --> 00:21:30.383
at the time when the garlands were given,

00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:33.864
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:37.025
but some of you took the garland put it in you.

00:21:37.226 --> 00:21:40.928
They regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

00:21:41.163 --> 00:21:42.692
but it is so.

00:21:42.893 --> 00:21:47.054
So when we are in India we have to understand Indians,

00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:50.733
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:53.450
For example in the west you just go on saying,

00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:57.046
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry.

00:21:57.444 --> 00:21:59.797
It is so confusing sometimes.

00:21:59.998 --> 00:22:03.087
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:07.131
I mean, I sometimes shake hands with nine hundred people at a time.

00:22:07.378 --> 00:22:10.965
And while they are going back again nine hundred people.

00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:13.885
I think namaste is a better idea,

00:22:14.086 --> 00:22:17.045
than to shake hands with every sort of a person,

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:20.860
you'll catch from every one. But it's a custom,

00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:24.064
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

00:22:24.264 --> 00:22:28.869
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

00:22:29.298 --> 00:22:33.625
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

00:22:33.826 --> 00:22:36.479
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.298
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

00:22:40.562 --> 00:22:43.726
and the ladies don't take garlands on their...,

00:22:43.927 --> 00:22:46.710
you see because any man cannot garland a lady,

00:22:46.911 --> 00:22:49.410
because it's only husband has the right,

00:22:49.611 --> 00:22:52.009
see, so anyone won't garland.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.148
Or a son can garland the mother,

00:22:55.446 --> 00:22:58.425
but any man cannot garland any lady

00:22:58.626 --> 00:23:00.529
who is of a younger age,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.350
or who is not yet married and even if married,

00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:08.098
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.311
So these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

00:23:12.512 --> 00:23:16.620
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street.

00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:21.715
Even if the leaders here are garlanded

00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:24.919
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.471
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out.

00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:34.841
So these are few customs which must be understood

00:23:35.042 --> 00:23:37.638
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic.

00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:40.793
Whatever is illogical we can give up,

00:23:40.994 --> 00:23:44.679
whatever is logical we have to take it and understand it.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.564
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

00:23:47.772 --> 00:23:49.715
children also started laughing, because they thought

00:23:49.916 --> 00:23:52.367
they are garlanding themselves.

00:23:52.568 --> 00:23:57.233
It's like doing aarti to yourself, you know,

00:23:57.762 --> 00:23:59.918
amounts to that.

00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:03.388
So you can understand why they were laughing.

00:24:03.589 --> 00:24:08.488
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

00:24:09.308 --> 00:24:13.178
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:13.392 --> 00:24:17.006
yesterday was Left Vishuddhi was too much.

00:24:17.491 --> 00:24:20.257
Perhaps maybe in the morning I said you were allready late

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:23.734
for the formal programme, I don't know.

00:24:23.935 --> 00:24:27.621
Whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

00:24:27.822 --> 00:24:30.249
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.129
in any formal programme.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.970
But it seems such a Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

00:24:37.171 --> 00:24:39.233
and I just knew what it was.

00:24:39.457 --> 00:24:41.836
So Mother says to you things

00:24:42.037 --> 00:24:44.087
which should not hurt you in any way

00:24:44.288 --> 00:24:46.418
and you should not take it that seriously

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:49.243
but should understand that next time we should not do so,

00:24:49.444 --> 00:24:52.903
otherwise you are all wonderful people, you are beautiful people.

00:24:53.197 --> 00:24:55.119
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

00:24:55.295 --> 00:24:57.138
but I am very proud of you.

00:24:57.339 --> 00:24:59.079
I'm extremely proud of you,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.463
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

00:25:01.664 --> 00:25:05.483
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

00:25:05.684 --> 00:25:09.076
I don't know what should I do.

00:25:09.504 --> 00:25:12.877
So not to take things that seriously.

00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:17.093
There's nothing so much wrong.

00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:20.458
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

00:25:20.659 --> 00:25:23.150
it's for our good, for our enjoyment.

00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:25.976
Everything to increase your enjoyment.

00:25:26.244 --> 00:25:30.284
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

00:25:30.485 --> 00:25:35.039
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

00:25:35.357 --> 00:25:38.180
all this is done.

00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:43.151
