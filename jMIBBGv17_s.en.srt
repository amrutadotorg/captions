1
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:12,886
It was very spontaneously decided

2
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:22,846
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

3
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:32,120
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

4
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,759
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

5
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,759
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

6
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:56,551
We have to today understand

7
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:01,367
that why do we do Devi Puja?

8
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:09,432
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

9
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,982
What do we get out of it?

10
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:18,777
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

11
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:22,091
within ourselves?

12
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:31,969
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

13
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:36,199
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

14
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:40,859
So when you worship Devi,

15
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:45,261
first you worship also your own Kundalini

16
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:52,426
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

17
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:55,960
It’s much deeper understanding

18
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,889
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

19
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:03,470
because they are not realized souls.

20
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,121
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

21
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:09,632
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

22
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,608
of getting realization

23
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,247
so that the Devi should be pleased

24
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:17,969
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

25
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,379
or must get our chance to get to somebody

26
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,087
who will give them realization.

27
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:29,576
But you are at a different level now.

28
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:34,166
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

29
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,592
and to Adi Shakti,

30
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:43,421
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

31
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,104
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

32
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:53,256
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

33
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:59,468
But one has to know that

34
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:08,103
only we are realized souls is not the point,

35
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:13,143
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

36
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:20,064
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

37
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:26,872
Then what is it? Very important –

38
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:30,833
it’s the content within us.

39
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:35,776
What do we have within us is the point.

40
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:39,529
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

41
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,511
Supposing somebody is generous,

42
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:48,992
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

43
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:54,432
So the content within us, we have to see.

44
00:08:55,406 --> 00:08:59,756
And when we start seeing the content,

45
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:09,138
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

46
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:16,363
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

47
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,426
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

48
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:28,161
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

49
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:31,505
and gives rain.

50
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:39,713
But sea is the lowest level,

51
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,914
stands at the lowest level

52
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:46,415
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

53
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:52,649
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

54
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:59,161
to be really achieving more content,

55
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:09,081
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

56
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,913
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

57
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:17,064
but I think it was not explained to people.

58
00:10:17,224 --> 00:10:22,338
Only the strong people can be meek,

59
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:25,585
secured people can be meek,

60
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:31,296
only the rich in essence can be meek,

61
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:37,923
not the people who are insecured.

62
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:42,663
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

63
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:50,480
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

64
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,626
because if they are rich they are not generous,

65
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:59,377
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

66
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:04,719
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

67
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:13,201
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

68
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:21,317
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

69
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:29,183
But when you love Me,

70
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:34,240
you have to know that there are certain qualities

71
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,440
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

72
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:44,768
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

73
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,768
They think they can get over everything,

74
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:50,248
they’re perfectly all right,

75
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:54,364
and they are thrown overboard.

76
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:01,127
So when we say that we have to be meek,

77
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:06,650
this is a content, the humility is a content.

78
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:11,902
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

79
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:15,302
You’ll like yourself.

80
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:21,606
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

81
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:26,013
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

82
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:31,392
And what is another thing we find has content

83
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:35,095
are the great mountains,

84
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,542
because they have heights

85
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:44,934
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

86
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:47,422
So such a rapport there is

87
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:53,007
between the humility of the ocean

88
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:57,391
and the heights of the mountain.

89
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:00,703
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

90
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:08,583
He is too high because so much of

91
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:17,022
content is there in that ocean,

92
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:20,382
then it has become beautiful

93
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:28,742
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

94
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,957
where resides the Shiva.

95
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:36,477
So it’s so joy-giving.

96
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:41,102
Of course as you have painted Me there,

97
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:45,382
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

98
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,942
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

99
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,902
in a very subtle manner,

100
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,142
because there’s so much of negativity

101
00:13:53,302 --> 00:14:00,502
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

102
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:10,982
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

103
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,516
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

104
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:19,517
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

105
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:22,878
there is a little blessing;

106
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:28,006
goes, I would say, a long rope.

107
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:35,422
But that long rope one should not care for.

108
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:40,102
You have to care for your own quality,

109
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:45,822
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

110
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:49,430
Now look at the ocean as it is.

111
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:56,253
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

112
00:14:56,838 --> 00:15:03,047
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

113
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:06,590
Only possible in the ocean.

114
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,982
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

115
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,727
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

116
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:16,042
inexhaustible.

117
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:23,122
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

118
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:28,120
and that can go and touch the heart.

119
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,163
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

120
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:38,101
where there is Shiva residing.

121
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:43,865
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

122
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:48,849
and unless and until you have that largeness,

123
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:55,580
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

124
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,482
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

125
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:04,762
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

126
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,682
it never leaves.

127
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:10,602
If Pacific Ocean was

128
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:15,090
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

129
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:21,202
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

130
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,250
it has its own maryadas.

131
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,362
But in that maryada he has the feeling

132
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:32,130
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

133
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,939
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

134
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:41,166
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

135
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:46,722
Nature is bound by the Divine.

136
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,882
The Divine looks after the nature.

137
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:53,568
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

138
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:58,228
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

139
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:03,178
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

140
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:10,562
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

141
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:16,218
You are above that like a mountain.

142
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:21,579
And so wherever there is a combination

143
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:26,940
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

144
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:31,394
Deep people can only come to such shores

145
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:34,249
where there is depth.

146
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:37,642
That’s how you achieve your depth,

147
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:44,002
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

148
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,675
that beautiful area where people can come to you

149
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:52,467
and just they know this is something great,

150
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:59,482
everybody knows that.

151
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:03,762
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

152
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:08,616
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

153
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:13,242
But how many people come to My program?

154
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:16,387
How do they come to My program? Must think.

155
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:21,460
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

156
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:32,602
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

157
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:36,190
And people had no place to sit.

158
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,793
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

159
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:44,062
there are no books published, nothing.

160
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:50,122
So you can say that, “Mother,

161
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:54,984
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

162
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:59,584
I do not, but it does – I think so.

163
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:08,387
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

164
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:12,250
the collective unconscious,

165
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:18,010
the Divine will act, definitely act.

166
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:22,482
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

167
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:25,922
this that, yes people come.

168
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:31,242
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

169
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,082
But where there is no money involved,

170
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:35,770
no business involved, nothing,

171
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:42,507
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

172
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:48,209
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

173
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,562
So the Divine works it out.

174
00:19:53,722 --> 00:20:00,137
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

175
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:05,489
then even if I am there it does not work.

176
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:10,009
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

177
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:13,707
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

178
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:17,513
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

179
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:21,450
a complete faith in yourself.

180
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,850
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

181
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,786
And what is this ocean?

182
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:35,306
It’s love, it’s love and love.

183
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,885
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

184
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:44,842
It just works spontaneously.

185
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:48,482
The less you do the better.

186
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:53,408
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

187
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:57,992
you just develop your content within yourself.

188
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:04,546
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

189
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:07,633
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

190
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:11,234
They had to go into jungles, they had to

191
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:15,249
take all the wrath of their gurus

192
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:20,005
and nobody to protect them.

193
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,876
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

194
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:30,402
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

195
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:35,322
whose power is all this Divine.

196
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:39,922
So you are at such an advantageous position.

197
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,907
But first you must realize.

198
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:46,962
So when we say we should have content,

199
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:51,322
then the vessel has to be strong

200
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:56,562
otherwise everything will break.

201
00:21:56,722 --> 00:22:00,256
And this strength is the one you should know,

202
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:04,696
that you are completely protected.

203
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:07,131
No one can harm you.

204
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,418
They’ll try.

205
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,980
This has to be otherwise how will you test

206
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,362
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

207
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:17,768
So somebody has to try some tricks

208
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:23,868
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

209
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:26,242
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

210
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:28,428
everything will be cleared out.

211
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:31,026
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

212
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:34,906
how things have worked out.

213
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,682
So the strength comes.

214
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:44,222
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

215
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:48,027
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

216
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:50,730
Shraddha is not blind faith.

217
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,442
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

218
00:22:54,602 --> 00:22:57,842
you know everything.

219
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:02,488
You’ve seen My photographs,

220
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,002
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

221
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:07,992
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

222
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:12,115
you can feel the vibrations;

223
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:17,313
you can feel others', you can cure others.

224
00:23:17,473 --> 00:23:20,002
All this power is within you.

225
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:24,002
But just to realize

226
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,602
that power without ego is your strength.

227
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:32,002
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

228
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,338
because what is the need there?

229
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,162
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

230
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:41,906
because you want to have more, more, more.

231
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:47,638
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

232
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:52,994
So this power is to be ascertained first,

233
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:57,322
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

234
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:59,650
to find out first.

235
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,977
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

236
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,914
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

237
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,354
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

238
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:18,322
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

239
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:24,042
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

240
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:27,042
who have reached great heights and some

241
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:29,802
who are outside.

242
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:31,882
All these are negative forces

243
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:35,282
which were killed long time back.

244
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,290
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

245
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:50,300
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

246
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:54,657
but you have so many of them.

247
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,889
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

248
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:01,396
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

249
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:06,236
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

250
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:18,155
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

251
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:23,288
you must have complete faith in yourself.

252
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:27,030
If you still doubt yourself,

253
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,482
that’s also a human quality.

254
00:25:32,642 --> 00:25:35,075
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

255
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:40,090
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

256
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:43,842
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

257
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,282
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

258
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:49,768
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

259
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:55,488
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

260
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:08,362
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

261
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:14,162
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

262
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:17,987
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

263
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,945
I am still doing like this, then how?”

264
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:24,082
Then get rid of it!

265
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,002
I mean, how can I solve your problem

266
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:28,482
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

267
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:30,602
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

268
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:33,002
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

269
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:35,202
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

270
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,473
this is what is the answer.

271
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:41,420
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

272
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:48,272
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

273
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:55,578
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

274
00:26:55,738 --> 00:27:00,012
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

275
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:05,519
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

276
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,482
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

277
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:12,386
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

278
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:15,334
None of them!

279
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:21,042
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

280
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:25,609
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

281
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,199
This is the, they could have said that

282
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,410
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

283
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,202
They had enough of everything, they must have.

284
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,095
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

285
00:27:38,255 --> 00:27:41,664
very big professions, very humble,

286
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:47,335
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

287
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:50,002
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

288
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:52,490
They would even touch My sari like that.

289
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,296
The place I walk they would touch, just imagine.

290
00:27:56,456 --> 00:28:01,772
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

291
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:05,064
How did they recognize Me?

292
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:10,776
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

293
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:13,497
And they never talked about God in that country.

294
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,777
They have some stupid people who have

295
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:21,607
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

296
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,962
most of the people are so strong

297
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,162
and the content is showing itself.

298
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:31,762
Imagine every time they have a program,

299
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:33,522
even now on follow-on,

300
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:37,922
at least one thousand people are there.

301
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:45,526
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

302
00:28:46,282 --> 00:28:49,040
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

303
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,162
from Siberia, this, that.

304
00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:53,689
And they have booked themselves,

305
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:56,602
because there the halls you have to pay for.

306
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:59,882
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

307
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:05,072
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

308
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:09,138
not to work it out, take it easy,

309
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:13,922
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

310
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:16,842
We don’t have to kill demons.

311
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:23,282
There’s no need to join any war

312
00:29:23,602 --> 00:29:29,842
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

313
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,962
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

314
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:38,847
lethargy from you, but work it out.

315
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:44,887
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

316
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:48,362
but you have to keep them awakened.

317
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:52,962
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

318
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:54,282
Not the way to meditate,

319
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:56,842
"All right, it’s like playing golf, sort of."

320
00:29:57,002 --> 00:30:02,122
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

321
00:30:02,282 --> 00:30:07,050
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

322
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:13,754
With that complete understanding and dedication

323
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:19,722
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

324
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:24,086
It’s something very subtle and special.

325
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:29,258
In no action we can describe it,

326
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:37,202
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

327
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:40,842
To that depth no other feeling goes;

328
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:44,563
with that feeling you have to meditate.

329
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:46,671
And then see the results.

330
00:30:46,831 --> 00:30:49,402
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

331
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:51,722
I’ve this still” –

332
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:57,562
because you are not deep enough.

333
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:04,042
It’s not how much you pray,

334
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:08,482
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

335
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:13,816
but it is how deeply you have touched

336
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:23,282
the feet of the Divine that is important.

337
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:29,317
So today we have to see that

338
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:36,429
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

339
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:41,162
so that all negativity runs away,

340
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:47,235
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

341
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:50,435
for Shiva to settle down.

342
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:56,522
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

343
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,882
It’s like an operation

344
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:03,402
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

345
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:05,682
you never even felt it.

346
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:09,802
The other day somebody gave Me a book of on the Devi's

347
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:13,202
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

348
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:15,522
– it’s correct, no doubt,

349
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,562
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

350
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:21,202
meaning 'without percussions'.

351
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:23,122
But I was reading that book, I said,

352
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:27,082
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

353
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:29,402
going into ‘this means, that means'."

354
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:32,522
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

355
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:36,042
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

356
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:40,242
and they know it so easily.

357
00:32:40,402 --> 00:32:44,922
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

358
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:48,402
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

359
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:53,202
has come to you so beautifully,

360
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:58,962
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

361
00:33:02,202 --> 00:33:07,602
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

362
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:10,945
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

363
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:18,065
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

364
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,683
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

365
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:27,607
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

366
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,162
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

367
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:32,522
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

368
00:33:32,682 --> 00:33:35,560
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

369
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,802
You see, human beings are great experts,

370
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:40,562
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

371
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:43,980
Nothing goes inside the heart.

372
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:51,247
But you have to develop that depth.

373
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:53,482
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

374
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:56,202
not through our brains.

375
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,014
You have to develop that heart

376
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:10,330
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

377
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:18,041
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

378
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:21,075
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

379
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:22,899
Any intelligent man can see that,

380
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:25,327
there’s no need to have his realization.

381
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:28,362
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

382
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:31,682
and he trusts. He trusts

383
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:36,563
himself then because he’s wise.

384
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:41,617
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

385
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:45,450
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

386
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:51,554
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

387
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,681
as you can see it clearly.

388
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:58,321
Of course, symbolically it is the same

389
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:02,576
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

390
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:07,576
The first work is to destroy the negativity

391
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:10,025
which is going on as you know.

392
00:35:10,185 --> 00:35:13,321
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

393
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:17,127
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

394
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:20,967
But you are the lights.

395
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:25,442
You have to put the lights on

396
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:28,090
and you have to look after your light,

397
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:33,930
and you have to make that light eternal.

398
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:41,760
This is one work which you are doing.

399
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:47,202
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

400
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:52,802
is to spread light, enlighten people.

401
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:56,602
The negativity that is around you

402
00:35:56,762 --> 00:36:00,562
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

403
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:03,495
Today it has become subtler.

404
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:06,322
The negativity has become subtler.

405
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:08,730
It’s entered into your being,

406
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,849
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

407
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:19,968
Even one step

408
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,867
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

409
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:25,547
you can go down.

410
00:36:25,896 --> 00:36:29,707
So one has to be alert, without tension.

411
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:33,192
You have to be alert without tension.

412
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:36,922
And the alertness grows.

413
00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:41,474
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

414
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:44,009
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

415
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:48,335
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

416
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:53,121
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

417
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:54,922
And immediately you take to it.

418
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:59,762
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

419
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:03,162
immediately you clean it.

420
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:13,787
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

421
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:16,737
'daksha' is the word for that.

422
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:20,843
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

423
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,322
Goddess used to give enlightenment

424
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:26,091
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

425
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:30,291
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

426
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,642
They are praying, they are doing puja,

427
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,451
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

428
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:40,439
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

429
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,858
from all negativity coming,

430
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:46,151
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

431
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:52,414
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

432
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:56,408
So you have to kill your negativity,

433
00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:01,350
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

434
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,690
No negativity can touch you.

435
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:12,249
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

436
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:18,769
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

437
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,442
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

438
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:27,802
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

439
00:38:27,962 --> 00:38:31,305
By that nobody is going to gain.

440
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:36,355
At the collective level it just works automatically.

441
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,126
You don’t have to worry.

442
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:42,522
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

443
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:46,682
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

444
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:49,562
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

445
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:52,082
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

446
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:56,982
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

447
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:03,883
Now another quality that you have:

448
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:06,442
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

449
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:10,522
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

450
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,202
it’s penetrated into you

451
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:20,762
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

452
00:39:22,962 --> 00:39:28,244
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

453
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:31,722
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

454
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:36,250
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

455
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:40,722
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

456
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:42,282
you get the cool from there.

457
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:45,282
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

458
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:46,762
you give bliss to others.

459
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:49,402
But there is no bliss within yourself,

460
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:52,353
but what bliss you can give to others?

461
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:55,737
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

462
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:57,937
You see She has very extreme characters,

463
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:02,538
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

464
00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:04,442
She can be very cruel,

465
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:08,737
and She can be extremely gentle

466
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:12,724
– like two ragas of yesterday.

467
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:27,439
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

468
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,370
beyond all human expectations,

469
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:37,930
and She could be extremely mild.

470
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:47,962
So this harsh part you need not have.

471
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:50,202
It will just work.

472
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:53,922
This part is only kept for the Divine.

473
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:56,760
You just take to the other side.

474
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,522
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

475
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:02,602
After all, Divine also must do some work.

476
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:09,962
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

477
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:13,896
So the Divine will look after that part.

478
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:19,232
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

479
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,967
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

480
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:26,305
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

481
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:29,146
their love – everything She enjoys.

482
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:32,583
In the same way you have to enjoy.

483
00:41:33,802 --> 00:41:36,402
You have to know about everything,

484
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:40,468
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

485
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:48,222
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

486
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:52,102
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

487
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,710
At the most!

488
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,582
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

489
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:00,862
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

490
00:42:01,022 --> 00:42:05,534
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

491
00:42:05,694 --> 00:42:07,222
And you are on the stage,

492
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:09,542
so they are looking out what to focus light,

493
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:12,302
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

494
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,702
what is to be changed around.

495
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:18,647
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

496
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:21,087
So you need not do all that work.

497
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:26,406
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

498
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:31,183
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

499
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:38,383
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

500
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:42,589
So to leave certain things into the hands

501
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:47,931
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

502
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:53,526
And that much of this, if done, then

503
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:57,692
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

504
00:42:57,852 --> 00:43:02,542
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

505
00:43:02,702 --> 00:43:07,998
We never expected how things we got it done?”

506
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:10,518
There’s a very, very big force working:

507
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:14,142
the Force, the Energy

508
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:17,359
which is the Source of all the energies,

509
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,456
which has created this great universe,

510
00:43:20,616 --> 00:43:23,896
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

511
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:27,952
which has created you very delicately.

512
00:43:28,112 --> 00:43:30,752
This Force is working.

513
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:33,312
And that Force is looking after you,

514
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:38,991
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

515
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:47,583
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

516
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:52,083
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

517
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:54,472
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

518
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,232
give us Your lion so we fight.”

519
00:43:58,392 --> 00:44:02,622
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

520
00:44:02,782 --> 00:44:06,606
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

521
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:09,135
these horrible conditionings we have.

522
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:12,358
You have to get rid of it.

523
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:16,695
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

524
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:20,272
lots of things, you see. If you see,

525
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:25,518
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

526
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:28,326
but they are there.

527
00:44:28,486 --> 00:44:33,238
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

528
00:44:33,398 --> 00:44:36,029
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

529
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:42,309
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

530
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:45,975
– like a Goddess. Why not?

531
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:51,592
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

532
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:54,952
So you have all the heritage available to you.

533
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:58,991
But you have to be worthy,

534
00:44:59,151 --> 00:45:03,709
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

535
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:07,322
You have to just know that you are worthy

536
00:45:07,482 --> 00:45:09,962
and that you can do it.

537
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:16,324
So again today we are here to do this puja,

538
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:21,995
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

539
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:26,547
and is luck for you to have this puja.

540
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:32,258
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

541
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:36,441
very subtler nature.

542
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:41,762
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

543
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:45,205
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

544
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:47,642
because it’s blood.

545
00:45:47,802 --> 00:45:52,801
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

546
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:57,915
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

547
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:01,010
another side it is the security.

548
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,530
So for you it is the security around you.

549
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:11,565
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

550
00:46:11,962 --> 00:46:16,878
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

551
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:20,314
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

552
00:46:20,474 --> 00:46:22,943
so beautifully you are settled down.

553
00:46:23,122 --> 00:46:26,816
May God bless you.
