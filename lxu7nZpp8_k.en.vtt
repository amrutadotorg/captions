00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.320
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.200
and were trying to develop your depth.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.960
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800
But we have to touch that,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400
that's very important,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.160
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.720
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.480
and that's a nice thing.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560
But we have to enjoy our own company also

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.000
by meditating, going within yourself.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.960
Now, “What is the use?”

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.640
one may ask. “Mother, now we have got realization,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.080
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.160
we are doing so well.”

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.560
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.480
of all the things, like all the elements.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.160
When you had finished your meditation

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.400
you saw how the rain fell down,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.640
how the rain came suddenly.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.640
So rain has felt your depth,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.320
or you have felt the depth of rain.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.400
Now you know that if you light one little candle

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.240
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.240
it acts, it reacts

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.960
and it gives you a flame which burns,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.080
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.800
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.560
So all elements have got an effect,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.240
if a saint wants to have an effect.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.320
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.600
Once you reach your own essences,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.240
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.240
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480
or you can order them as you like.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.560
First they will act,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.080
expressing that they have been touched

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.800
like today, the rain came pouring down.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.480
Then later on you can command,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.640
and you can ask the rain to come.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.720
To work out many things of that kind

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.800
we have to be deep people,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.320
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.800
That is, you know very well

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.720
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.160
and when we go deep into ourselves,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.240
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.400
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.960
When we start moving horizontally,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.560
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.880
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.640
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.600
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.800
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.320
and then everybody can hear it.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.960
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.480
you find that you have communicated with another person.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.960
But that's only the essence of the ether

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.280
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.240
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.560
we can say, by science,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.320
but you go to the subtler side, and that subtler side

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.000
gives you all these effects.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.720
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.000
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.960
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.880
somebody's with the head the light is coming

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.400
you have seen all this.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.240
This is done also by the same method,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.720
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.080
She's very active, She works it out,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.880
She does all these things.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.400
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.560
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.880
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.880
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.960
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.400
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:11.960
So all the, all the essences are working out for you,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.440
as well as all the deities are working out for you.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.480
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.560
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.480
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.800
if you don't keep yourself all right.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.840
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.880
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.800
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.360
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.800
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.800
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.720
also the problem of the city where I am,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.920
also the problem of the country where I am,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.320
maybe of the whole universe.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.560
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.640
and I do it quietly.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.560
But you must also understand

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.000
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.400
By horizontal movement what happens

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.240
that you start meditating on a particular subject

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.720
which is a very bothersome subject,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.440
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.720
Anything – you just put your attention to it and meditate.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.520
If you are that deep,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.720
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.120
you will immediately put an effect on that.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.320
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.480
there will be something happening in that direction.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.880
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.720
So we have to meditate,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.160
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.680
so automatically we start solving the problem.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.160
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.240
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.000
to help so many things which are to be helped.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.400
Now you see that people are realizing

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.840
that the world is in a great mess,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.080
and there are lots of problems that have come

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.080
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.080
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.320
We have no time for all this.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.320
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.320
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.960
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.560
is for the inner improvement as far as the personal side is concerned

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.080
means your intelligence must improve,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.640
your temperament must improve,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.800
your heart must clear out,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.720
your feelings must be all right.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.560
Then you should, your health should be all right,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.720
then your relationship with others should be all right,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.480
your ego should go away,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.400
your superego should go away

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.800
all these things are there.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
But this only helps a personality,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.000
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.440
But now this personality can become an instrument,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.560
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.320
But normally what happens, people are

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.320
very much still worried about themselves,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.800
say about their wives, about their children,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:36.080
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.640
These are not important things, because we have to be those

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.960
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.720
we have to develop that depth within us.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.480
That depth is possible,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.000
and you can really cure many problems of your country

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.040
if you could just meditate on them.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.800
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.240
which I had felt were there in Canberra

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.720
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.040
All these problems came into My understanding,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.520
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.880
My working style is different because I have very sharp

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.480
and very effective instruments.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.560
But I have to pay attention to it

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.320
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.400
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.960
those deeper feelings within you,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.920
deeper sense within you.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.240
But mostly people are very superficial type.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.560
They just think about their body,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.560
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.880
At the most they’ll think we have to be very legal-minded,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.080
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.560
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.720
But I think that is not so.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.960
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.320
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.880
It's not true also,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.400
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.880
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.960
but the deeper you go into that love,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.720
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.560
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.560
Gradually that quality improves.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.160
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.800
that house must become auspicious.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.800
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.720
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.640
anger, passion, lust, greed,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.560
then such a heart won't affect.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.880
But a person who has purified himself,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.000
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.880
the whole change will take place.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.960
The circumstances will change.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.320
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.280
Like they said, “Mother, as soon as You

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.320
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.360
as far as the television is concerned

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.960
and radio is concerned.”

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.080
I didn't do anything – in a way.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.480
But that should happen with you also.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.560
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.640
But you have to be a saint,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.760
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.760
of another person,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.800
and this is what it is lacking:

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.040
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.960
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.480
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.400
but it should deepen much more.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.720
You should go further and further.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.840
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.080
It's the other way round also.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.400
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.200
We all must meditate, that is very important

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.040
meditate sincerely.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.800
Not just because we have to meditate

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.120
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:04.360
to express our great powers of divine love;

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.240
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.360
I know you all can do it.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.800
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.600
big education for that, nothing is needed.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.880
What is needed is a deep feeling

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:31.160
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.800
The all-destructive forces change their course,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.240
and it is then for the constructive forces.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:47.240
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:53.240
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.560
with understanding. All right?

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.080
May God bless you.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.640
It is much more than our music,

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.840
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.040
And now the course has to change.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.160
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.920
So may God bless you for that.
