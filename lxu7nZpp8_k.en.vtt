00:08.800 --> 00:12.320
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

00:12.560 --> 00:19.200
and were trying to develop your depth.

00:19.400 --> 00:25.960
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.800
But we have to touch that,

00:27.960 --> 00:30.400
that's very important,

00:30.560 --> 00:35.160
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

00:35.400 --> 00:38.720
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

00:38.960 --> 00:40.480
and that's a nice thing.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.560
But we have to enjoy our own company also

00:44.800 --> 00:49.000
by meditating, going within yourself.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.960
Now, “What is the use?”

00:53.160 --> 00:55.640
one may ask. “Mother, now we have got realization,

00:55.880 --> 00:59.080
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

00:59.320 --> 01:02.160
we are doing so well.”

01:02.360 --> 01:07.560
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

01:07.800 --> 01:11.480
of all the things, like all the elements.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.160
When you had finished your meditation

01:14.320 --> 01:16.400
you saw how the rain fell down,

01:16.640 --> 01:18.640
how the rain came suddenly.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.640
So rain has felt your depth,

01:21.880 --> 01:24.320
or you have felt the depth of rain.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.400
Now you know that if you light one little candle

01:27.640 --> 01:31.240
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

01:31.400 --> 01:34.240
it acts, it reacts

01:34.400 --> 01:36.960
and it gives you a flame which burns,

01:37.160 --> 01:42.080
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

01:42.320 --> 01:47.800
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.560
So all elements have got an effect,

01:52.800 --> 01:58.240
if a saint wants to have an effect.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.320
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.600
Once you reach your own essences,

02:04.800 --> 02:11.240
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

02:11.400 --> 02:15.240
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

02:15.480 --> 02:17.480
or you can order them as you like.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.560
First they will act,

02:19.800 --> 02:22.080
expressing that they have been touched

02:22.320 --> 02:25.800
like today, the rain came pouring down.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.480
Then later on you can command,

02:29.680 --> 02:32.640
and you can ask the rain to come.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.720
To work out many things of that kind

02:36.960 --> 02:38.800
we have to be deep people,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.320
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.800
That is, you know very well

02:45.000 --> 02:48.720
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

02:48.960 --> 02:51.160
and when we go deep into ourselves,

02:51.400 --> 02:57.240
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

02:57.480 --> 03:02.400
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.960
When we start moving horizontally,

03:05.160 --> 03:10.560
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

03:10.800 --> 03:15.880
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

03:16.080 --> 03:19.640
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

03:19.840 --> 03:24.600
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

03:24.800 --> 03:31.800
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

03:32.000 --> 03:34.320
and then everybody can hear it.

03:34.560 --> 03:40.960
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

03:41.160 --> 03:45.480
you find that you have communicated with another person.

03:45.680 --> 03:51.960
But that's only the essence of the ether

03:52.160 --> 03:55.280
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.240
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

03:58.480 --> 04:00.560
we can say, by science,

04:00.720 --> 04:04.320
but you go to the subtler side, and that subtler side

04:04.480 --> 04:07.000
gives you all these effects.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.720
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

04:10.880 --> 04:14.000
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

04:14.240 --> 04:16.960
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

04:17.160 --> 04:19.880
somebody's with the head the light is coming

04:20.080 --> 04:21.400
you have seen all this.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.240
This is done also by the same method,

04:25.480 --> 04:29.720
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.080
She's very active, She works it out,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.880
She does all these things.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.400
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

04:37.640 --> 04:41.560
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

04:41.760 --> 04:47.880
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.880
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

04:52.080 --> 04:55.960
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.400
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

04:58.600 --> 05:11.960
So all the, all the essences are working out for you,

05:12.160 --> 05:15.440
as well as all the deities are working out for you.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.480
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

05:19.640 --> 05:23.560
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.480
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

05:26.720 --> 05:28.800
if you don't keep yourself all right.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.840
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.880
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

05:36.080 --> 05:37.800
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.360
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

05:40.560 --> 05:42.800
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.800
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.720
also the problem of the city where I am,

05:49.880 --> 05:51.920
also the problem of the country where I am,

05:52.120 --> 05:54.320
maybe of the whole universe.

05:54.560 --> 05:59.560
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

05:59.800 --> 06:01.640
and I do it quietly.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.560
But you must also understand

06:03.720 --> 06:07.000
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.400
By horizontal movement what happens

06:09.640 --> 06:13.240
that you start meditating on a particular subject

06:13.480 --> 06:15.720
which is a very bothersome subject,

06:15.960 --> 06:19.440
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.720
Anything – you just put your attention to it and meditate.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.520
If you are that deep,

06:26.720 --> 06:29.720
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

06:29.880 --> 06:33.120
you will immediately put an effect on that.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.320
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

06:36.560 --> 06:39.480
there will be something happening in that direction.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.880
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.720
So we have to meditate,

06:44.920 --> 06:49.160
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

06:49.320 --> 06:54.680
so automatically we start solving the problem.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.160
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

06:58.360 --> 07:04.240
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

07:04.400 --> 07:08.000
to help so many things which are to be helped.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.400
Now you see that people are realizing

07:10.560 --> 07:13.840
that the world is in a great mess,

07:14.040 --> 07:16.080
and there are lots of problems that have come

07:16.320 --> 07:19.080
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

07:19.240 --> 07:23.080
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.320
We have no time for all this.

07:25.480 --> 07:29.320
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

07:29.480 --> 07:35.320
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

07:35.560 --> 07:39.960
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

07:40.160 --> 07:44.560
is for the inner improvement as far as the personal side is concerned

07:44.720 --> 07:48.080
means your intelligence must improve,

07:48.240 --> 07:50.640
your temperament must improve,

07:50.880 --> 07:52.800
your heart must clear out,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.720
your feelings must be all right.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.560
Then you should, your health should be all right,

07:59.800 --> 08:02.720
then your relationship with others should be all right,

08:02.920 --> 08:04.480
your ego should go away,

08:04.720 --> 08:06.400
your superego should go away

08:06.560 --> 08:08.800
all these things are there.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But this only helps a personality,

08:11.240 --> 08:15.000
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.440
But now this personality can become an instrument,

08:18.640 --> 08:21.560
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.320
But normally what happens, people are

08:24.480 --> 08:27.320
very much still worried about themselves,

08:27.480 --> 08:29.800
say about their wives, about their children,

08:29.960 --> 08:36.080
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

08:36.240 --> 08:40.640
These are not important things, because we have to be those

08:40.880 --> 08:44.960
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

08:45.160 --> 08:47.720
we have to develop that depth within us.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.480
That depth is possible,

08:49.720 --> 08:54.000
and you can really cure many problems of your country

08:54.240 --> 08:57.040
if you could just meditate on them.

08:57.240 --> 09:01.800
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

09:02.000 --> 09:05.240
which I had felt were there in Canberra

09:05.480 --> 09:11.720
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

09:12.040 --> 09:17.040
All these problems came into My understanding,

09:17.240 --> 09:20.520
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.880
My working style is different because I have very sharp

09:25.080 --> 09:27.480
and very effective instruments.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.560
But I have to pay attention to it

09:30.800 --> 09:33.320
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.400
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

09:37.640 --> 09:39.960
those deeper feelings within you,

09:40.160 --> 09:41.920
deeper sense within you.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.240
But mostly people are very superficial type.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.560
They just think about their body,

09:47.720 --> 09:51.560
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.880
At the most they’ll think we have to be very legal-minded,

09:56.080 --> 10:02.080
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

10:02.320 --> 10:07.560
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.720
But I think that is not so.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.960
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

10:15.160 --> 10:18.320
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.880
It's not true also,

10:20.080 --> 10:24.400
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

10:24.600 --> 10:26.880
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

10:27.080 --> 10:28.960
but the deeper you go into that love,

10:29.160 --> 10:34.720
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

10:34.880 --> 10:38.560
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.560
Gradually that quality improves.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.160
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

10:45.320 --> 10:48.800
that house must become auspicious.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.800
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.720
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

10:56.960 --> 11:03.640
anger, passion, lust, greed,

11:03.880 --> 11:05.560
then such a heart won't affect.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.880
But a person who has purified himself,

11:08.080 --> 11:13.000
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

11:13.240 --> 11:16.880
the whole change will take place.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.960
The circumstances will change.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.320
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.280
Like they said, “Mother, as soon as You

11:25.480 --> 11:28.320
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

11:28.520 --> 11:31.360
as far as the television is concerned

11:31.560 --> 11:33.960
and radio is concerned.”

11:34.160 --> 11:38.080
I didn't do anything – in a way.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.480
But that should happen with you also.

11:40.640 --> 11:45.560
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.640
But you have to be a saint,

11:47.840 --> 11:53.760
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

11:53.960 --> 11:57.760
of another person,

11:57.960 --> 12:01.800
and this is what it is lacking:

12:01.960 --> 12:06.040
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

12:06.240 --> 12:11.960
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

12:12.160 --> 12:16.480
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

12:16.720 --> 12:20.400
but it should deepen much more.

12:20.640 --> 12:25.720
You should go further and further.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.840
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.080
It's the other way round also.

12:33.320 --> 12:38.400
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.200
We all must meditate, that is very important

12:42.400 --> 12:45.040
meditate sincerely.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.800
Not just because we have to meditate

12:49.000 --> 12:55.120
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

12:55.320 --> 13:04.360
to express our great powers of divine love;

13:04.560 --> 13:09.240
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

13:09.400 --> 13:13.360
I know you all can do it.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.800
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

13:16.960 --> 13:20.600
big education for that, nothing is needed.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.880
What is needed is a deep feeling

13:25.080 --> 13:31.160
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.800
The all-destructive forces change their course,

13:35.000 --> 13:39.240
and it is then for the constructive forces.

13:39.480 --> 13:47.240
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

13:47.400 --> 13:53.240
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

13:53.480 --> 13:56.560
with understanding. All right?

13:56.760 --> 14:00.080
May God bless you.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.640
It is much more than our music,

14:08.880 --> 14:13.840
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.040
And now the course has to change.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.160
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.920
So may God bless you for that.
