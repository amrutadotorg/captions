00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.880
I have a little bit of a cold, so I hope you guys won't mind. And also, thanks a lot for

2
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.960
inviting me. I appreciate it. And I know some of you want to also hear about the Native

3
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:37.120
Americans. But I think I told Carolyn that I think that that is a program in itself because

4
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:47.200
it's such an important aspect of Sahaja Yoga. And it wasn't just me, you know, there were

5
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.280
many, many yogis involved in it. And also, we spoke about Michael Fusselli and Steve

6
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.840
Day. And hopefully, Jill Bajeskew, I hope she's on here. I'm under, I don't, she's been very

7
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.920
instrumental with the, you know, the progress and the building of Kannada Haari. I was

8
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.000
involved with the Native American programs for myself with other yogis. We visited the Native

9
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.120
American reservations. But we, I think it's a good idea if we can bind both my experiences and

10
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.480
the importance of Kannada Haari. And I think that can happen in a later future when Carolyn,

11
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.440
you know, would like it to happen. So basically, I'm going to share with you

12
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:49.280
some very interesting experiences that I had before and after Sahaja Yoga.

13
00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:01.920
I've been blessed so many times by our Divine Mother because as I was telling Caroline a couple

14
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.480
weeks ago, before Sahaja Yoga, I was really very, very sick. And had it not been for,

15
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.320
you know, Shri Mataji coming into my life and me practicing Sahaja Yoga, I would probably be dead

16
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:28.960
by now. And that's the truth. Because of, you know, the liver, you know, the emotional stuff,

17
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.600
all of the, you know, the junk and the negativities that we pick up, you know, in our

18
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:48.240
childhood. But I came into Sahaja Yoga in 1983. And it's been an incredible journey since then.

19
00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:02.160
And it continues to be such an important part of my life. With outside yoga, there to me, you know,

20
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.880
there's nothing more important. But anyway, it was, it was about two, three months before

21
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.440
I did meet Shri Mataji in 1983, that I was getting really, really sick. I was smoking, you know,

22
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.320
I was trying to raise my son. I had a lot of financial problems trying to, you know,

23
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.440
get my life together. And I could feel myself getting really sick. I mean, physically ill.

24
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.320
And, and I knew I had to do something and I just kept praying and I kept saying, God, you know,

25
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.240
what am I supposed to be doing? You know, what, what, how can I improve my life?

26
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.320
And at that time, my husband was doing the Hatha Yoga. So he suggested that and I,

27
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:04.640
I did start the Hatha Yoga. And I did only a couple of programs. And the second or third

28
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:15.040
program that I did, remember, was a young man named, his name was Joseph. And we did some of

29
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.080
the physical exercises. But then I would notice that when we did the Hatha Yoga, my, my, my,

30
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.360
the Hatha Yoga, my, my, the right side of my body would still keep hurting. And that was like,

31
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.720
my main problem at the time, because I kept giving all this pain. And my right side,

32
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.840
I didn't know that it was, of course, the liver and the right Swaritana. And, and so

33
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.880
the Hatha Yoga was not doing it for me, because every time I would go to the class,

34
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.600
I would leave my, my right side was still being pain. And I said, this is not helping me. Anyway,

35
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.880
the last class that I had with this young man, his name was Joseph. We got through the exercises,

36
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.840
and I was, you know, in pain. And he started talking about he was going to go to India.

37
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.120
And immediately, I got very interested in that. And he said, he said that he was going to go to

38
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:22.320
India, and that he was going to go see a famous guru who was making diamonds come out of his hands

39
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.360
and also would make rice come out of his hands to feed the poor people. And as he was saying these,

40
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.120
I kept thinking to myself, something's not right here, because I felt, you know, I felt that it was

41
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.400
instinctively I felt that it was not right. And so he kept talking about the program of what he

42
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.080
was going to do. And, and inside of me, I said something was wrong here. And I didn't, I didn't

43
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.680
accept what he was saying. But I didn't say anything out of respect for him, you know. And I left

44
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.080
his venue. And I remember going out and waiting for the bus that was in Manhattan,

45
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.120
I think was the Upper West Side. And I was waiting at the bus. And I started thinking of what

46
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.680
this guy told me. And all of a sudden, as I was standing waiting for the bus,

47
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.680
my eyes just automatically closed. I was not in control. My eyes automatically closed.

48
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:34.560
And a vision appeared into my mind. It was, I saw this background of like, hills.

49
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.720
And standing in front of these hills was the figure of a woman dressed in white.

50
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:53.440
And she was in profile. And the hair was very long and black. And it looked like a braid

51
00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:02.240
to me. But she was standing in profile very, very still. And then

52
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.040
I could feel these rocks underneath my feet, like tiny little pebbles

53
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.520
underneath my feet. I don't know why, but I remember that. And I could feel these pebbles

54
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:23.280
underneath my feet. And the vision was like in a grayish color. But she mounted these guns

55
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.480
totally white. And she was standing in profile. I didn't, of course, I didn't know who that was.

56
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.120
I didn't know what was happening. But I felt that it was something

57
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:45.120
something that was right, that to me seemed okay. And then the vision disappeared.

58
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:53.120
And then I got on the bus, still thinking about what had happened. And I started having some kind

59
00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.880
of a vision itself, where this is something I could not even understand. But as I was

60
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:08.880
sitting on the bus going home, I had this kind of a vision of something of very, very primordial

61
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.520
happening. So as if it was like the beginning of the earth, the beginning of something, I don't know

62
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:30.400
what. And then it stopped. And then I went home. And that evening, my son was

63
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.360
home from school. And I was preparing dinner. My husband went to work. And I was sitting on the

64
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.560
couch. And I started to think of what happened at, you know, this Hanta Yuba teachers class.

65
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.040
And then all of a sudden, I had to, I had to open up my hands. I mean, all of this happened beyond

66
00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:00.080
my control. I had to, I just felt that I had to open up my hands. I sat on the couch.

67
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:13.360
And I closed my eyes. And I hear this incredible sound. It was the sound of wind.

68
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:22.400
It was like, just coming from out of nowhere. And it was just coming towards me. It's like a

69
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.240
record sound of wind. And it was coming towards me. And it penetrated my head.

70
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:38.560
It penetrated the top of my head. And at the same time, I looked at my son and I realized he was

71
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.280
okay. And he was doing the same thing. He was sitting down, he stopped playing with his toys.

72
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.040
And he was also holding up his hands and had his eyes closed. So we were both sitting there.

73
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.920
I was on the couch. He was on the floor. And we're taking in this incredible energy.

74
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:06.000
And I just let it come in because I knew it was something that was good. And I didn't fight it or

75
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.560
anything. And I have no idea how long it lasted. Maybe, I don't know, a minute, two minutes, five

76
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:26.800
minutes. I don't know. But then when the wind stopped, my entire body was, felt healthy. It

77
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.640
felt good. And I know something had happened to me that was really nice. And yet I couldn't figure

78
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:43.200
out what it was. And then after that, my son and I went back to what we were doing. I think I was

79
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:50.320
watching TV or reading a book. I remember. And even when I'm playing with his toys, my hands felt

80
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.920
energized. My hands were like, there was like energy running through my hands. But I couldn't

81
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:09.920
figure out what it was. But I knew it was good. And then I went on, you know, with my life.

82
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.400
Two or three weeks later, I kept thinking about that. And I still couldn't figure out what it was.

83
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.440
And once in a while, I would get this sickening feeling in my stomach, like,

84
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:33.600
you know, my body being ill. And then the, then every time my body started getting ill,

85
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:40.640
I'll say, God, please help me, please help me. And I could feel my hands pulsating. It was like,

86
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.480
I could feel my fingers like, like energy was running through my fingers. And my hands were

87
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.360
pulsating. And then I would feel good. Then I would feel good again. And then,

88
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.520
and this continued for about three, four weeks. And I still didn't know what was going on. I

89
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.960
stopped going to the Hatha yoga person because I felt that he was what he had told me was wrong.

90
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.640
And I just continued with my life. And every time I kept, you know, feeling sick, I would say,

91
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.880
God help me and my hands would pulsate without me knowing what was happening. But I knew it was

92
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:25.440
good. And so I knew that something was coming my way that was something I knew it was God.

93
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:36.480
But I, how can you explain who is God and what is God, right? And then I was done at the village

94
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:43.920
about this about a month and a half later, I was not in Greenwich Village, I forgot what I was

95
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:51.840
doing. But I walked into this deli. And as I look on the left hand side, he looked up and there was

96
00:12:51.840 --> 00:13:00.320
a poster. And it was, I noticed the poster of this beautiful woman. And I'm thinking, Oh my God,

97
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.120
she was so beautiful. I still have that poster, by the way. And I never seen anybody so beautiful.

98
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:14.560
And then I read about the information on the yoga program, wakened up Kundalini,

99
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:26.880
the time of the date and so forth. And I wrote it down. And when I got home, I called and they said,

100
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:34.480
Oh, Mother is coming in a couple of weeks come to the program saying mother, you know, why why

101
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:43.360
she's saying mother? I you know, why? Why is that? Why? Why mother? And so it was Judy Gaddy's voice.

102
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:51.440
Some of you, of course, I'm sure know her. And she's the one that's first answer. But then,

103
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.760
you know, funny thing is, I kind of forgot about that. I just

104
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.480
either went to work or I went about doing my own stuff. And

105
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.600
and then about a couple weeks later, I called again. And this time, Michael Fusilli answered,

106
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.920
I didn't know who he was, but Michael, and he said, Yes, yes. You will be coming in a few days,

107
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.000
come to the program. And you can learn about the Kundalini and you can learn about the

108
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:32.160
chakras. And so I did go to the program. And it was September 16, 2000. I'm sorry, not 1983 at

109
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:41.280
the Carl Jung Center. And then he used to 38th Street on Fifth Avenue. And I remember walking in

110
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.720
my actually my brother around his girlfriend with me. And I remember walking in and she

111
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:53.600
started the program. First of all, there was a very dynamic. I think it was a woman who was

112
00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:00.960
talking about the Carl Jung and the chakras and talking about evolution and spiritualism and so

113
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.960
forth. Then Shri Mataji came on. And I was looking at her and I said, Oh my God, she's so beautiful.

114
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.640
My God, I've never seen anything so beautiful around my life. Because again, she was dressed

115
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:24.560
all in white. And I just, I listened to her, we went through the self realization. I didn't feel

116
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:31.040
that much because I was so physically I was still sick. My right side was completely messed up.

117
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:38.880
My left side doesn't knows where it was that came later. But the negativity was embedded in there,

118
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:46.240
although I didn't know that, you know, that I wasn't aware of the negativity, but it was there.

119
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:56.240
And when the program was over, I didn't feel that much. But then Shri Mataji, I remember her walking

120
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.320
down the stairs, somebody up and she came down the stairs, and she was saying hello to everyone.

121
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:10.640
But I did. You know, the funny thing is, I did not trust her. Isn't it funny? Because

122
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:19.760
I grew up in a Catholic environment. And I had dealt with so, you know, quite a few, you know,

123
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:26.880
Catholic priests and nuns, and most of them, I have to say, were not very nice. A couple of were

124
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:39.360
very, very good. But I was hesitant to accept any one who talked about spirituality. So

125
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:48.080
I didn't say anything I didn't. Shri Mataji offers funniest, not when I think about it,

126
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:59.600
it's, I feel bad. But I know, my hesitant to accept any spiritual person was so strong, because

127
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:08.480
I had such a negative experience in the Catholic Church when I was young. But anyway, we went home

128
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:15.040
with, you know, I felt okay. Then I took the information about the programs.

129
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:26.960
And I went back. And then I forgot exactly what happened in between. But I remember we had a big

130
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:35.600
seminar up in Deer Park, New York. And the office were telling me, come to the seminar,

131
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.200
Shri Mataji will be there, it'll be a three day weekend. And so I said, I want to go because,

132
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:48.080
you know, even though I wasn't fully convinced of what was happening to me, I, you know, I was,

133
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.840
I wanted to go. And also, in that meantime, I did start put soaking, by the way, and I did feel a

134
00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.880
little better. But I, of course, I should have been doing it much more, I did it like maybe

135
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.960
two or three times a week or something. And physically, I was feeling a little better. And

136
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.600
I said, let me just go to the program. And that afternoon, that Friday afternoon,

137
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:19.120
I went to Judy's house because they were going to pick us up. And I'm sitting there, I was dosing up

138
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:25.760
on the couch waiting for the ride. And there was three or four of us and I hear Judy Gaddy, and I

139
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.840
know most of you know her, Judy Gaddy saying, well, she was talking to one of the ladies there.

140
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:38.960
Well, you know, well, she was, you know, was the Madonna, she was Jesus Christ.

141
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.880
She was the mother of Jesus Christ. And, and at that moment, I woke up, I was like,

142
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.200
I came out of my days. And I said, what? I mean, to myself, I said, what?

143
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:58.320
The mother of Jesus Christ. You know, I was confused, you know,

144
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.080
but something just like, boom, just something hit me and something really, really woke me up.

145
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.440
And I couldn't talk, I couldn't say anything. So I told Judy, I was just gonna,

146
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.880
hope for a coffee. I just, I just, I just didn't, I needed to go out and,

147
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.600
I don't know, I just had to go out. I went outside, I went to a coffee shop and I was

148
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:29.280
drinking this coffee. And I remember thinking, the mother of Jesus Christ.

149
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:38.080
Wow. You know, in the middle of a sudden, something in my awareness, something so primordial.

150
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:47.520
And it's hard to explain what I was feeling because it's inside of my head. And it's,

151
00:19:47.520 --> 00:20:01.440
it's, it's an experience. And it's hard to explain this, you know, very primordial, ancient memory.

152
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.400
And I was just astounded. And I'm thinking, what just, what is, what is it that's happening to me,

153
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.160
you know, but all the time, I knew it was something very good,

154
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:25.280
that it was something for me to accept. And then we finally got our ride, we went to Deer Park.

155
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:34.960
She gave a seminar. And I still remember looking at her thinking, she was just, you know,

156
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:40.480
this very good, beautiful woman. She gave a wonderful seminar, we could ask questions.

157
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:47.520
And my question, I asked you about my son, because at the time I was smoking.

158
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:58.240
And my son's left ears, left and right ears both were being affected by inflammation.

159
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:06.000
And she told me, you know, how to use the olive oil and to warm up the cloves and the garlic,

160
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:15.440
the olive oil, and put the drops in his ears. And that evening after the seminar was over,

161
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.280
I went outside again, I was walking back and forth, back and forth. And

162
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:29.920
because there's something I couldn't grasp. And I knew, I, some, I knew some, somebody was not

163
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.520
telling me something, you know, because I kept thinking, she's the mother of Jesus Christ, then

164
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.840
what is going on here, you know? So I kept walking back and forth, back and forth.

165
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:46.640
And then all of a sudden, I remember Michael Petrunia, some of you may know him,

166
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.720
he passed on now, but Michael came by and he said, Anna, what's going on? He said,

167
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.000
what is going on here, Michael? Because there's something I don't understand, you know?

168
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.720
What is this, what's with Shammataji? What is, why is the seminar, what is, you know, going on?

169
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.120
And he said, but Anna, don't you know, this is the last judgment.

170
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:20.400
And I'm listening to him and he said, the men that are traveling with Shammataji are the 12

171
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:30.480
disciples, and she's the Holy Spirit. And then I thought, and then I said, well,

172
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:39.840
if she's the Holy Spirit, and this is the last judgment, does that mean that everything is going

173
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.560
to change from now on? That the world is going through a very, very big change? And he said, yeah,

174
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:56.720
of course. He said, that was the truth, you know, and then all of a sudden, I started feeling

175
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.120
the pebbles underneath my feet that I had experienced after I left the Hatha Yoga teacher,

176
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.920
and then looked in the back, I automatically just turned around and I was like, oh,

177
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.360
I looked in the back, I automatically just turned my head and I looked in the back and I saw the

178
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:29.760
hills. And then I realized that that vision that I had had in all of those experiences of my hands

179
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.840
pulsating, you know, was Shammataji, she was the Holy Spirit, and she had come into my life.

180
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:44.560
And that I knew that this was something so important, and, you know, so with a great purpose.

181
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:57.440
And that, you know, it was, they started to come together at that point. And

182
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:07.280
it was just probably one of the most powerful experiences I ever had, you know, the realization

183
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:16.720
that the Holy Spirit was on earth. And yet, at that point, I still, like with most of the yogis,

184
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:25.200
we still couldn't comprehend, you know, just the intensity. And I was just, I was just,

185
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:33.600
I was just completely exhausted. And just what is the nature of the Holy Spirit?

186
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:49.280
You know, and anyway, so that weekend was very, very intense. I just remember all of

187
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:57.760
the feeling, the power of the experience itself, the realization of what was happening in my life.

188
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:07.200
And at one point, we were told we could write letters to Shammataji before we would go back

189
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:14.160
to New York. And I wrote a letter. And I forgot, I forgot, I gave it to one of the yogis.

190
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:23.440
And in my letter, I wrote, Yeshe Mataji, who is God? What is my purpose on earth? And

191
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.560
what am I doing here? You know, who is God? What is my purpose on earth? What am I doing here?

192
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.640
And I gave the letter to the yogin, I totally forgot about it.

193
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:43.040
Then after that, I started going to the programs, and you know, doing more foot soakings. And

194
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:51.200
feeling, feeling much, much better after the foot soakings. And I hadn't stopped smoking yet.

195
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:57.280
That took me six months. Maybe shooting was so bad. It took me six months, but I finally did.

196
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:06.720
And just a couple of more experiences. I had forgotten about that letter.

197
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:14.240
And about a, maybe a month and a half later, two months later, I was sleeping. And I began to,

198
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:22.560
you know, in the meantime, I started going to the programs whenever I could, and feeling better and

199
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:32.800
trying to feel, you know, much, much better, just what my head was happening with my chakras, my

200
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.480
head was happening with my chakras, my fingers, and so forth. And just trying to, you know,

201
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:46.880
insert my way into the life of a Sahaja Yogini. And one evening, I was sleeping, and I had a dream.

202
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.080
And in this dream, I saw Shrimataji again, you know, she was dressed all in white.

203
00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:03.200
And she was standing so tall and so majestic. And she was holding paper in her hand. And somehow I

204
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:15.600
knew that was my letter. You know, and she said, I am aware. I said, Oh, wow, you know, I get this

205
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:22.560
feeling of like, total joy, total happiness, that she had come into my dream. And that she had read

206
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:29.200
my letter. And she said, I am aware. And the dream ended and I went back to sleep. But I slept

207
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:39.600
so soundly that night. And then about a week later, I went to the school to pick up my son

208
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:48.720
from school. He was five years old. He was an inter gardener, I think, or first grade, I think

209
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:55.280
was first grade. And I was waiting for him. And I'm sitting on the bench, I was sitting outside

210
00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:05.520
the school. And I'm sitting on the bench, and I'm thinking about that dream. And all of a sudden,

211
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.720
I had to close my eyes and my all of a sudden, my Kundalini shut off, just

212
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:19.600
went like a wind, it shut up and it hit my organ here. And at that level of the acne stopped.

213
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:30.000
And I saw two or three images. And one of them was an image of my past life.

214
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:39.840
And although I knew it was the Kundalini, and I instinctively

215
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:49.120
understood what was happening, because when something of the nature of the divinity occurs,

216
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.080
the divinity if they want, it's going to allow you to understand what is going on, because this

217
00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:06.000
is something to be fine for the human mind to comprehend. But it was happening to me. And I knew

218
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:14.480
that I was understanding what was happening. Kundalini allowed that I knew that. And I saw

219
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.200
an image of my past life, as the Kundalini was in my apnea.

220
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:27.440
And I understood the Kundalini was telling me that we evolved through reincarnation,

221
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:39.920
that it is through past lifetimes that we grow and that we go through these lifetimes, and

222
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:48.960
eventually we will find our source. And then after that was understood,

223
00:29:49.840 --> 00:30:00.160
the Kundalini went into my satsarata and my satsarata went, you know how Chumashji explains

224
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.840
the thousand petals are like flowers. And that's exactly what happened when the Kundalini was

225
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.920
fully awakened in my satsarata, my satsarata was fully opened. And

226
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.520
Chumashji allowed me to experience just what it means

227
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:31.520
to be a person, to be a person who is in the satsarata.

228
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:46.240
And what it means to be fully, fully connected to our source, to who is God, what is what it is.

229
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:57.120
And I remember hearing the word akasha as this opened up, there was a world,

230
00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:04.960
you can't, it's hard to explain because it's a dimension that human beings cannot

231
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:17.200
fully understand. It's a divine dimension, it's a dimension so far removed from the human.

232
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:25.040
And there was the universe, I saw the entire beautiful magnificent universe in

233
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:35.440
its, what is the word, it's energy, it was everything was white.

234
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:45.120
Now it wasn't really like this, this is what Chumashji allowed me to understand that our satsarata,

235
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:52.080
that when we are fully opened to the divinity, we are in a different dimension.

236
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:57.040
This is what I understood. It may be something different, it may be, but this is what Chumashji

237
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:04.400
allowed me to experience. And it was a universe of divinity where it was a total understanding,

238
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:18.240
total love. The love was permeating everywhere and it was just so beautiful. And then there was

239
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:26.800
and then there was this huge big white ball of energy and somehow that was just love.

240
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.960
It was love personified and it was just the synergy and I said, wow, that's God.

241
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.320
He said, it's got to be God. And then I saw these little tiny little white,

242
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.600
they look like little balls, but they were like tiny little planets. They were also white,

243
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:56.640
just like the huge big one. And somehow I understood these little white balls were the yogis.

244
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:09.680
So from that experience, Chumashji was telling me that we are headed towards a divine world that

245
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.960
is just, it's so much for the human brain to understand. And this is the only way I can explain

246
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:28.320
it because at the moment that my satsara was opened, I was fully connected to it. It was total

247
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:35.920
love, total knowledge. It had complete knowledge of everything. And somehow I heard this again,

248
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.240
I heard the word akasha. And then when I was telling this to somebody who told me that akasha,

249
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:48.640
those are like the records of the, I think that's what you guys can explain. I don't know,

250
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:56.960
but they're like the records of the recordings of the universe or the recordings of

251
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:04.320
whatever is going on in the world, the akasha records.

252
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.520
And then I, again, I didn't know how long it lasted, but then it went vroom, then the satsara,

253
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:24.000
it just quickly closed. It just like vroom. And I was back and that's the human skin.

254
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:35.040
And that's the human state. And at that moment I heard, mommy, mommy, mommy. It was my poor son

255
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:41.360
calling me and he said, mommy, mommy, come on, come on, mommy, what's the matter? But I was like,

256
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:49.680
I felt like I was drunk because the energy above my head was so powerful. And it was also like,

257
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:55.440
also kind of permeating in my total body, but it was mostly focused on my satsara.

258
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.320
And so my son is, you know, pulling at me. One second, hold on guys.

259
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:19.600
I talk about this, my mouth gets so dry, but my son took me out of this state of,

260
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.800
the state of what you wanted you, wants all of us to be really,

261
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:32.000
we're meant to be. And that's why we're giving self-realization.

262
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:39.520
And we're given this great, tremendous, powerful gift. And so I,

263
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.960
I was at my son's home. He kept saying, come on, mommy, hurry up. And I was like drunk. I couldn't

264
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.760
walk because the energy up there was so intense.

265
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.000
And we finally got home. Luckily my husband was there. He took over

266
00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:03.840
and he watched my son and I had to go to sleep. But also, I was walking home.

267
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.960
Again, you know, Shomateji allowed me to understand that we are the spirit.

268
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:19.520
You know, that, yeah, we're in a physical body, but our spirit is there. And she allowed me to

269
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:28.080
experience the complete total difference between who we are as a spirit and who we are as our body.

270
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:36.880
And again, as these things were happening to me, she allowed me to understand just what was going

271
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:45.920
on. And I remember when I got home, I had to go to sleep because I was just,

272
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:53.360
my body was so tired from the experience, although I knew it was something very magnificent.

273
00:36:54.320 --> 00:37:05.680
And I had to go to sleep. Anyway, this is part of, you know,

274
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:14.240
Shomateji blessed me with. And I was talking to Carolyn a couple of weeks ago and I was thinking,

275
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.560
you know, why doesn't everybody experience this, you know?

276
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:30.960
And then as I was talking to her, I also realized that it was because she wanted me to stay in

277
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:42.240
Sahaja Yoga because had I not, had she not allowed me to fully, fully understand just what Sahaja

278
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:48.960
Yoga is and who we are and what our role is in this evolutionary process, I probably would have

279
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.840
left because I would have left Sahaja Yoga, not because of anything, because I was very sick.

280
00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:08.880
You know, I was very, very sick. And I was really, I probably would have left. Okay, I did have the

281
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:16.080
relief of the right side because again, the right side is so easy to clear. But then the left side,

282
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:24.160
which was even more imbalanced in me, that Shomateji took care of that later,

283
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:35.040
because it wasn't time yet. But it's just, it was just something that is,

284
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:45.600
I guess it's hard for people to understand because it's a vibrational energy that happens

285
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.080
and this is what Shomateji talks about all the time is the energy, the energy.

286
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:59.040
And this is, you know, what we're working with. And just one more thing, I don't know how much

287
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:07.280
time we have, but just two more things. Anna, I just want to say, yeah, we have as much time as

288
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.240
you want. It's 8.30 now, our time. We can go on until nine o'clock quite easy. So just talk until

289
00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:20.560
you finish telling the stories you need to tell. I just want to say a couple more things because

290
00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.200
they're important, you know, they're important because

291
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:38.560
I think we all have to realize just the tremendous times that we're living in.

292
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.560
These are so important. I know we've heard this before. You know, we hear it all the time.

293
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:50.880
Shomateji tells us all the time this, you know, and yet how much of it do we really, really

294
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.840
appreciate? And how much of it do we really understand?

295
00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:08.480
And how much do we imbibe it? I think that's probably the most important aspect of Sahaja Yoga.

296
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:17.040
How much of Shomateji's work, how much of her dedication, how much of the blessings

297
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:25.280
she has given us do we imbibe? You know, and I just, you know, I try to,

298
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:35.680
you know, imbibe it as much as I can. I've made mistakes. A lot of you know I made big

299
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:44.640
vubus in Sahaja Yoga because we're all human beings, you know, and so, you know, Sahaja Yoga

300
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:51.040
to me is a journey. It's first of all, it's an individual journey where, you know, we have to

301
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.800
know who we are, you know, we have to know, like in that experience that I had, it's the reincarnation

302
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:04.880
through these lifetimes we go through that we are on this journey to reach our own self.

303
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.320
Our source.

304
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:15.200
But as Sahaja Yogis we have to imbibe it, we have to live it, you know, we have to really, really

305
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:22.960
appreciate just the tremendous blessings that the Arishakti has given us, you know.

306
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:34.960
So basically, just two more things. I already told Carolyn this, that the right side

307
00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:43.120
you know was eventually, you know, got balanced even though if I'm not careful it

308
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:50.080
the liver will go out but it's mostly under control. But we know that the left side is very,

309
00:41:50.080 --> 00:42:01.280
very deep and complicated. It's a complicated channel because, you know, it's our emotions,

310
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:11.280
you know, it's the intangible things that is hard for us many times to comprehend.

311
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.440
The right side, sure, you know, the liver creates the heat if we don't eat well,

312
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.520
if we're too much into, you know, the future, you know, we just have to ourselves back into,

313
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:28.160
you know, the present and your foot soak, you know, you put ice in your liver, you eat well

314
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:34.640
and it's fairly easy to clear unless it's something very, very serious. But it's usually

315
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:44.160
fairly easy to clear. But the left side is really so complicated, you know, because as I was telling

316
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:50.000
Caroline that, you know, I don't even remember my childhood. That's probably why I think Shimataji,

317
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.840
but you know, but I wasn't the only one that experienced these incredible things. I know that

318
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.680
Javier's father experienced the same thing because I was talking to Javier one time quite a few years

319
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:12.160
ago and he said his father, you know, experienced the exact same experience of when the Kundalini

320
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:20.560
came up and he saw the Inis Sashrata opened. So it's not just me, you know, I'm not saying

321
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:27.520
that just because I, you know, I experienced these things I'm special. I think what Shimataji does

322
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:36.000
she knows what each one of us needs, you know, she knows each one of us as individuals.

323
00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:43.760
We're not, yes, we're a cell in her body, but she knows everything about us, everything.

324
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:53.840
She knows us down to the minimum part of our little chakra. She knows what lives we've led.

325
00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.560
She understands all she has to do is look at you and she knows everything about you.

326
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:09.120
And so basically after I cleared my right side, then she said, okay, now it's time for me to work

327
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:16.240
on your left side. And I didn't realize it, you know, I think a lot of us when we first come to

328
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:23.040
Sahaja Yoga, we know, we think, oh my God, you know, the Holy Spirit, she's here finally,

329
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:29.360
you know, it's what we've always were looking for. Now our lives have meanings, you know,

330
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.480
but many times I think I talked to quite a few yogis who say, you know, they think that everybody's

331
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:41.600
going to understand this, but you know, but they don't because when I, the first times in Sahaja

332
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.400
Yoga I tried to tell people about Sahaja Yoga and about Shimataji, they didn't get it. And I'm

333
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:53.440
wondering, you know, why? And somehow I made a mistake of, you know, telling people, I mean,

334
00:44:53.440 --> 00:45:00.320
I didn't do it every day, but you know, sometimes I would say it, maybe too often that Shimataji is

335
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:06.400
the Holy Spirit, you know, it's something so important. And I didn't know why they couldn't

336
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:12.320
get it. You know, I hadn't understood yet, you know, the process of spiritual evolution and the

337
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:19.600
process of cleansing the chakras and, you know, how much we are ready to get to know the divinity,

338
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:26.160
you see. So that made me make a few mistakes. And I think quite a few yogis have done that also.

339
00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:40.720
Anyway, during the time, so we started programs, we get programs in, not just me, with other yogis,

340
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:47.760
we did programs in the prisons, we did programs in drug rehab,

341
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.560
and it was never just me alone, there were so many other wonderful yogis. You know, I went on with my,

342
00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:04.480
with Sahaja Yoga work. And it was only 1997 then I began to realize that something was happening

343
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:13.360
within me that I needed to address, that I hadn't quite yet fully comprehended.

344
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.760
And I had a dream one evening, and I had this dream I was sitting next to Shimataji.

345
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.960
I was sitting on her left side. And all around me, all these yogis were running around,

346
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:31.680
they were busy preparing this and preparing that, you know, they were all I think preparing for a

347
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:37.520
program. And I'm sitting next to her and she said to me, I have to work on you alone.

348
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:46.400
And I said, and I, the dream ended, you know, and I didn't quite understand what that meant.

349
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:57.520
But I found myself a couple of weeks later, I left, so I did leave Sahaja Yoga, I found that I

350
00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.280
couldn't go to the collective. Personally, I wasn't told not to go, I just couldn't go,

351
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:13.520
I don't know why. And then I started having these dreams of my past. And I started having

352
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:22.000
all these headaches, my back acne. You see, I never, I don't remember my childhood, and I

353
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.080
think that's probably why Shimataji allowed me to experience these things. Because had I not

354
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.840
experienced them, I probably would have left Sahaja Yoga not realizing its importance, because

355
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:44.160
I had too many catches, you know, there was too much darkness that needed to be addressed. And

356
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.680
I couldn't quite understand why they were happening. But anyway,

357
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:59.360
but she, if we're seekers, you know, if we really want to know ourselves, and we pray to her,

358
00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:08.560
she will allow you to understand who you are, and who you are in this great big scheme of,

359
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:17.440
you know, Sahaja Yoga, this last judgment, the times, these incredible times that we're living in.

360
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:25.920
And so anyway, after I left Sahaja, I left the collective for a while, I started having these

361
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:34.720
dreams of my childhood. And I started getting headaches. And the headaches were so intense that

362
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.560
a lot of even aspirants could take the pain away. Sometimes the headaches would be so intense that

363
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.000
I would have to, like either hold my head like this. It was my back acne, basically.

364
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:54.560
Shimataji was starting to work on my back acne. And how it started was, I forget what month it

365
00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:03.280
was, we were supposed to have a big, big parade on Fifth Avenue in 1997. And I watched the goal,

366
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:08.800
but I was sitting in my kitchen, I could not move, I was trying to meditate. And I was trying

367
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:15.440
to go to the parade, because they were going to, you know, parade with Shimataji's banner with the

368
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:22.960
music and so forth. And I couldn't move, I couldn't move. And I'm sitting down. And I was meditating.

369
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:30.240
And all of a sudden, I see my Kundalini in my head. I see the Kundalini shoot up my spinal

370
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:37.120
cord is fire. And it came up along the spinal cord, and it came to my left side.

371
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:45.280
And then I'm just sitting there just meditating, trying to meditate because my body was in

372
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:51.120
just horrible pain, you know. And it was Shimataji clearing away my past,

373
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:59.120
or trying to open up my back acne. And I think I sat there for like at least an hour and a half,

374
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:06.160
and I couldn't move. And I finally was able to sit down. But then after for a whole year,

375
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:13.200
what would happen is, I could feel the back, you know how the back acne goes this way,

376
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:20.240
and it comes around to the back and it goes down. The back acne here was opening up. It was like,

377
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:29.680
like stretching out like this, see, like little by little, and as it opened up little, little by

378
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:39.360
little, the headaches were horrible, you know, it was so painful. That's how closed that back acne

379
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:46.160
was. I had forgotten in my childhood, I had forgotten my memory. And Shimataji was working

380
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:58.160
out of my left side. And that happened, that took a year. I mean, again, you know, it was

381
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:14.320
blessings, all of this came about because I hadn't yet fully comprehended or understood just how bad

382
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.640
my back acne had been. I mean, I knew that I didn't remember anything from my child since I was

383
00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:26.480
from my child until I was eight. And even now I have, you know, problems with memory.

384
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:37.120
It's not as bad. But I hadn't realized that this was really just a really, really bad left side

385
00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:43.200
of catch. And I think I know now why Shimataji said I have to work on you alone. Because that

386
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:50.160
had been in the collective, it would have been even more painful. Because the vibrations of

387
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:56.240
the collective would have probably tried to open up the back acne even quicker, and it would have

388
00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:01.760
been more painful. And I think that's probably why it took, it took a full year, almost a year

389
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:16.960
and a half to fully understand just how the back acne was closed. And now it was not operating at

390
00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:23.120
all. Let's put it that way. I mean, I was only to the right side, you know, I was doing the programs,

391
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:28.960
this and this, this and this. Some of you always thought I was nuts, you know, of course they still

392
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:36.000
do. But, you know, I guess it was because Shimataji allowed me to fully comprehend what

393
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.840
our responsibilities are of Sahaja Yoga. And so I went with that in the beginning for the few years

394
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:51.280
of these programs. But then I had a push back, because then I had to clear even a more intense

395
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:57.200
part of me, which the left side. And I was telling to say, Carolyn, that after about a year, year and

396
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:05.440
a half, I could feel the difference, you know, I never realized that I didn't have any peripheral

397
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:15.280
vision. You know, after about a year, I remember feeling feeling good, the headaches finally

398
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:25.920
stopped. And I felt so much lighter. I felt like this incredible weight had been taken away from me

399
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:37.200
and I felt lighter. I felt, you know, more, more bouncy, you know, more happier. And then I remember

400
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.360
I was sitting there in a car or in a bus somewhere, and we're looking at the traffic lights. So the

401
00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:48.880
traffic lights were changing from green to red, green to red, and I'm looking at the lights.

402
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:57.760
And I never realized that I was almost colorblind. And that after this year of

403
00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:05.280
Sri Mataji working in my back ajna, the colors were so bright. And I didn't realize that,

404
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:11.760
that, you know, that I was missing out on this, you know, you know, seeing the beautiful vibrant

405
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:19.920
colors, they became vibrant after my back ajna cleared. And then also I began to have peripheral

406
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:26.560
vision, because I didn't realize that I did not have peripheral vision. It was after a year,

407
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:31.920
almost a year and a half that I could see him on the sides of my face. You see, so

408
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.880
that was another, another thing I wanted to share with you, because this is the way Sri Mataji

409
00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:48.160
works, you know, it's not just meditating, kudzoking, doing programs, and, you know,

410
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.600
the things that we're all taught that we all do. But it's every day, there is something

411
00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:05.280
that for us to imbibe, you know, and to live through the fullness as yogis is just a

412
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:11.120
tremendous, it's just a tremendous life, you know.

413
00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:27.600
And then of course, after that, I had to, I realized that, yeah, you know, that I, I

414
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:34.400
was using so much on my right side, which was good. But at the same time, I realized that

415
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:42.960
it was kind of too forceful, I had to go back and balance it with the left. And again,

416
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:51.520
Sri Mataji made me realize, it made me go through the cleansing, you know, the process of

417
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:58.960
removal. Because actually, that's what it is, isn't it? When the Kundalini cleanses

418
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:07.360
a chakra or a channel, it's removing negative vibrations that are embedded in us,

419
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:14.480
that need to be removed. And once they are removed, you know, we reach a higher state of

420
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:23.040
understanding of, you know, our vibrational being. Basically, that's what it is, you know.

421
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.120
You know, quite a few other miracles happened,

422
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:42.240
would take maybe too long to speak about. But I think that's what I'm trying to do.

423
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:49.680
Speak about, I want to say, I'm going to send you a photo that you guys can see it. So I'll

424
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:55.200
explain a little bit now what it is. But I'll just talk about that one photo.

425
00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:06.000
Again, it's just to share with you the power of our mother, you know, that we are so blessed.

426
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000
We're not, like I was talking to my Iraqi brother, Jerry, you know, and he was saying also,

427
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:19.840
you know, people think we're nuts. Because, you know, if we tried to tell them what we go through,

428
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:29.680
spiritually, people don't understand it. Because they're not there yet. We hope everybody can get

429
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:37.680
there. You know, we're just blessed. And she not to Jimmy, she might have blessed me with so much.

430
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:44.480
And again, you know, I haven't been a perfect yogi or made so many mistakes. I know most of you

431
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.080
know my mistakes. But we have to learn, you know,

432
00:57:50.080 --> 00:58:01.760
we have to overcome. We have to overcome our negative thoughts, our negative

433
00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:12.080
past. That's probably the worst thing is to try to overcome the negativity from our past.

434
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:21.600
To try to overcome the negativity from our past, because it takes, it wants to hold on to you,

435
00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:30.240
you know. The past, the boats, the negativity doesn't want to leave. They want to hang on to you.

436
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:38.240
They don't want to leave because they have nowhere to go. They know that if they hang on, then,

437
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:44.080
you know, there's somewhere, you know, where they can somehow work through you, whatever,

438
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.360
they can get what they want, but and they don't want to leave. But this is our work is to remove

439
00:58:51.200 --> 00:59:00.880
that, that those negative entities, the negative experiences in order for us to basically reach

440
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:12.080
the highest. And this is where it takes courage, you know, it takes desire.

441
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:21.200
Because, you know, again, I was sharing with Carolyn that, you know, I grew up in a,

442
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.680
I was born in a very, I mean, my family is great. They're good.

443
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:32.000
I'm not saying anything bad against anybody. But the environment that I grew up in, I was

444
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:40.480
small in Italy, was very, very, it was the worst kind of negative stuff, you know, about, you know,

445
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:48.640
superstitious part of Catholicism. You know, that was, did a bad number on me, you know,

446
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:54.320
and we have to overcome it. We just, we just have to let it go. Sometimes it'll, it'll come,

447
00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:01.040
it'll try and, you know, try and take over. But, you know, we have no mother, you know,

448
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:07.120
we have our Kundalini's, we have to be, we have to be her strong children, because if we're not

449
01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:16.400
her children, who are we? We have to be, we have to be worthy, you know, worthy of what she's given

450
01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.520
what she's given us. Anyway, I will send you the photo.

451
01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:32.080
That's another miracle that I'll send it on the WhatsApp group. It's a small little, like,

452
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.240
four by four. And usually photos are either four by six or five by seven.

453
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:46.240
But the year that I came to Sahaja Yoga 1983, that December, I was in Judy Gaddy's house,

454
01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.880
she was given a meditation program for Christmas. And it was like a, you know,

455
01:00:52.880 --> 01:01:01.520
like a pre Christmas celebration. And I went and John Partridge also came back from India.

456
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:08.720
Some of you may know him. He sometimes meditates, but he's not really, you know,

457
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:17.840
fully in the collective. But he brought back the book, the Advent that Gervois had written,

458
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.760
and he had given me a copy and was giving a copy to all of the blue seekers that were there. We were

459
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:33.200
maybe five or six or seven meditated. And John told us about his experiences in India. And

460
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:42.880
he gave me a photo. And I looked at the photo, I saw this hematogy. And then we were going to

461
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:48.320
start the meditation. So I just put it in the book. And then I forgot about that photo. And

462
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.280
that evening, I went home. Of course, I enjoyed, you know, John's, you know, recollections,

463
01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.600
as India was, and we all need to go to India and things like that. And I went home,

464
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.680
and I happened to open up the book and I saw the photo. And I kept looking at the photo.

465
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:13.680
I kept looking at it, and I saw shematogy. And then I kept looking. She was holding

466
01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:26.080
a little, looked like a little boy in her bosom. She had her right hand on his center heart.

467
01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:36.000
And her left hand on his, I think it was the left Vishuddhi, like this, and her right hand on his

468
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.440
center heart. And I kept looking and looking. And it was only the back of the head. And I said,

469
01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:49.280
my God, that was that was my son's hair. You know, that's my son. She's holding my son.

470
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:57.440
I couldn't see his face. But you know, that was his hair, brown hair. And the clothes,

471
01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.240
I recognize his clothes that he had, although I could only see just the top portion of his body.

472
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.160
And then I looked again, and I see this little thing. I said, wait a minute, what's something on

473
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:14.960
the left side of shematogy? And I was on the left side of shematogy with my red jacket that I had

474
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.080
about the Salvation Army. Because at the time, I didn't have that much money, you know, said,

475
01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:27.840
Oh, my God. And I called John. Say, John, where did you get this photo? He said, what photo is it?

476
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.000
The photo that you gave me? And he said, I don't know. It came out of my camera. But I've never

477
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.480
been to India. And he said he brought the pictures from India. And that's where he took

478
01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.520
the photos. It was from India. And I said, but I've never been there. We were, you know, we just

479
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.560
came to South York in September. And he said, I don't know. So that's, that's another miracle

480
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:57.760
photo. I can send it to you guys, because so the borders is like a white border. And it's a,

481
01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:03.920
it looks like a four by four, like equal sides. And, you know, usually, pictures are not equal

482
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:10.880
sides, you know, maybe very few. This is four by four. So white border, and shematogy's eyes

483
01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:21.200
are sparkling. And she's holding on to my son. So, but I just want to end. I mean, I could go on

484
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:35.280
and on. But I just want to end this presentation with just the one for the, the one experience

485
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.440
that I think we should all know about just what's happening nowadays, you know,

486
01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:51.440
we see shematogy is, you know, being old, you know, she was ill. And in her last years,

487
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:58.960
you know, she was in a wheelchair. And of course, whatever mother went through is because of us

488
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:05.520
to clear us, to clear humanity, and to, you know, bring forth the spiritual evolution that

489
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:12.240
the spiritual evolution that where we are meant to be in this process of spirituality.

490
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.040
And it was not 2006. And
