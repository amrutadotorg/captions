00:00.001 --> 00:04.048
First Public Program in Turkey (Istanbul)
Emirgan Korusu, 25.06.1989

00:06.145 --> 00:11.406
I bow to all the seekers of truth

00:16.063 --> 00:18.420
Can somebody translate me?

00:20.223 --> 00:24.402
Gregoire: I can see, they are already in meditation

00:54.977 --> 01:00.767
I said, I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:13.632 --> 01:18.132
Now, we have to realised

01:18.211 --> 01:21.989
that truth can not be conceptualized.

01:27.655 --> 01:32.726
Truth is and will feel all the time.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.799
We can not organize it.

01:44.553 --> 01:47.727
And those who are seeking truth,

01:47.755 --> 01:51.476
after know that they should keep their minds open.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.877
Like a scientist.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.911
And whatever we are telling you,

02:02.936 --> 02:06.063
has to be taken as a hypothesis.

02:10.080 --> 02:18.251
And if it proofs, right, than you have to
accept it as honest people.

02:26.394 --> 02:31.485
Since long there has been talked about truth.

02:36.172 --> 02:40.925
Socrates  talked about it
and he was killed.

02:46.174 --> 02:51.954
Then came Christ he talked about it
he was killed.

02:55.977 --> 03:03.011
Then came prophet Mohammed Sahap
and he was also in a way killed.

03:10.068 --> 03:13.647
But today the human awareness is much better.

03:19.994 --> 03:24.636
And we are understanding that truth has to be

03:24.661 --> 03:28.446
beyond our mental projections.

03:40.981 --> 03:44.767
When we see those people who talk of peace

03:44.792 --> 03:48.981
and talk of any theories of democracy

03:49.006 --> 03:51.923
or capitalism or communism

03:59.712 --> 04:06.302
or they talk of any religion like Islam,
Hinduism, Christianity.

04:12.426 --> 04:15.092
Everyone is the just the same.

04:17.475 --> 04:22.606
There is no binding force,
anybody can commit any sin.

04:28.009 --> 04:30.556
So where are we got wrong.

04:34.239 --> 04:39.778
All these prophets and saints
and incarnations were

04:39.803 --> 04:45.723
absolutely truthful
but where have we gone wrong.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.133
There is one thing common among all of them

04:57.157 --> 05:02.434
that they said, you must see the eternal.

05:10.467 --> 05:14.636
And considering things are
to be used in their moderation

05:14.652 --> 05:17.392
and in their limitations.

05:25.301 --> 05:28.610
This is the essence of all the religions.

05:34.095 --> 05:38.666
But we have gone wrong
because we did not see later.

05:45.072 --> 05:48.699
And got lost into transitory things.

05:53.273 --> 05:55.677
There was nothing wrong with those

05:55.701 --> 06:01.356
who started on these great religions
and great philosophy.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.853
But we missed the point.

06:16.718 --> 06:20.001
But today the human awareness has reached

06:20.006 --> 06:23.660
the state where it can see so clearly.

06:30.775 --> 06:37.630
That the fulfillment of the promises
given to us has to be done.

06:43.227 --> 06:49.610
It is said that there is the ruh,
the all-pervading power round us.

06:57.338 --> 07:00.441
All the living things
that you see like flowers,

07:00.466 --> 07:06.089
fruits and trees and
human beings are miracles.

07:13.324 --> 07:16.863
These are worked out.
These are worked out through

07:16.888 --> 07:20.504
this all-pervading subtle power.

07:29.009 --> 07:35.426
But so far we have never felt it
enmass, this power.

07:41.005 --> 07:45.745
Few saints have faith it
but nobody would believe that.

07:51.416 --> 07:54.881
But now a special blossom time has come.

07:58.841 --> 08:01.350
And in this blossom time

08:01.366 --> 08:05.611
we are going to find out the truth
without any difficulties.

08:11.421 --> 08:14.947
It has should be the easiest thing

08:14.963 --> 08:17.711
because it is a living process.

08:23.654 --> 08:29.661
But you saw the seed in the mother earth
it sprouts spontaneously.

08:39.623 --> 08:44.537
In the same way within us,  this power

08:44.562 --> 08:49.535
which I have told you, is described
as al-Asas, (The Foundation) in Koran.

08:57.876 --> 09:02.296
In the Bible as the holy ghost.

09:08.925 --> 09:12.797
And in the inner scriptures as Adi Shakti,

09:14.201 --> 09:17.201
Primordial Mother as Athina.

09:27.386 --> 09:34.939
Resides in triangular bone called as sacrum,
meaning sacred bone.

09:42.051 --> 09:45.966
This is the power of God’s desire

09:45.991 --> 09:51.939
which resides within us
as our pure desire.

10:01.668 --> 10:09.774
And it spontaneously rises and break
through our fontanel bone area.

10:21.728 --> 10:30.098
So actually, you get the actualization
of your baptism, actualization.

10:38.420 --> 10:43.419
It is not just artificial certificate.

10:50.089 --> 10:54.827
Once you become connected with
the all-pervading power

10:54.867 --> 10:56.922
and you become a saint

11:05.052 --> 11:07.643
or you become wali (a Muslim saint)

11:09.901 --> 11:12.599
or you become a self realized soul.

11:16.344 --> 11:18.755
As a result of that,

11:18.780 --> 11:23.261
transformation starts taking place
in every human being.

11:29.403 --> 11:32.669
And this transformation is very unique.

11:35.851 --> 11:41.385
Such a person automatically becomes purified.

11:47.038 --> 11:51.508
You don’t have to tell such a person, don’t do, don’t do.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.430
He just does not do wrong things.

12:00.449 --> 12:05.840
He becomes very dynamic
but very compassionate.

12:10.995 --> 12:18.010
And lives in complete joy and peace.

12:24.886 --> 12:29.539
All this is your right, as human beings to have it.

12:34.247 --> 12:39.540
This is the glory, that is within us.

12:47.128 --> 12:52.385
Only, our instrument has to be connected to the main.

13:00.443 --> 13:05.765
Also, physical, mental, emotional disorders

13:05.790 --> 13:09.601
get completely corrected by this power.

13:18.703 --> 13:25.562
And you start feeling this
formless energy all round yourself.

13:33.705 --> 13:39.684
So, you get your enlightenment
your attention becomes enlightened.

13:48.173 --> 13:53.578
Now we have here people from,
I don’t know how many countries

13:53.631 --> 13:59.281
who have come to Istanbul to meet you all.

14:08.998 --> 14:14.296
It is surprising how it was difficult for

14:14.321 --> 14:20.083
anyone of this western country people,
specially English, French

14:20.108 --> 14:23.859
who even pronounce one Indian Hindi word

14:23.884 --> 14:28.404
or any other language in Indian language.

14:40.075 --> 14:43.026
But now, these we are pronounce sanskrit.

14:45.246 --> 14:48.348
And later all they will be singing Arabic.

14:50.852 --> 14:54.264
Because now they have become universal being.

14:57.772 --> 15:02.162
And this is what we have to touch
this our universal being which is the spirit.

15:09.529 --> 15:14.857
Now we have people, we have Jews
who worshiped Muhammad Sahap,

15:14.860 --> 15:17.598
who worshiped Christ.

15:30.632 --> 15:37.419
Because through their experience of truth,
they have realized that they were incarnations.

15:42.963 --> 15:46.431
All these great incarnations and prophets

15:46.456 --> 15:51.187
came on the same tree of life, at different times

15:59.084 --> 16:03.115
to give us balance and to save us from evil.

16:09.031 --> 16:14.205
But we have plucked the flowers and
we are saying this is mine this is mine

16:14.218 --> 16:17.591
and fighting with these dead flowers.

16:25.690 --> 16:29.994
So it is important for all people who are honest

16:30.018 --> 16:33.484
and who are seeking the truth,

16:33.492 --> 16:36.785
should achieve their self-realization and see

16:36.889 --> 16:41.992
the absolute truth about them.

16:51.047 --> 16:55.614
They never talked ill about each other

16:59.681 --> 17:03.164
but only we, in our ignorance do that.

17:07.985 --> 17:12.136
So, this light has to come within us.

17:15.475 --> 17:18.493
Supposing we are holding a snake in our hand

17:18.511 --> 17:23.473
and there is darkness and your eyes are not open.

17:23.508 --> 17:27.993
You will not believe, if somebody says
there is a snake in your hand.

17:40.576 --> 17:45.242
But if you get the light and your eyes are open up,

17:45.253 --> 17:50.239
you will immediately yourself believe that snake.

17:58.507 --> 18:02.334
So, a person become so powerful and so free

18:02.382 --> 18:09.505
that no bad habits can dominate him.

18:23.542 --> 18:30.099
You yourself, become your own master
and manage yourself.

18:35.403 --> 18:39.323
I do not have to tell you, don’t do this and don’t do that.

18:43.015 --> 18:46.012
I am sorry for today’s delay but

18:46.037 --> 18:52.269
you know, there were problems
of traffic and all kinds of things.

19:00.096 --> 19:02.802
It was very unexpected.

19:06.679 --> 19:10.583
So, I hope, you will excuse me for coming late.

19:16.081 --> 19:19.708
Tomorrow of course, I will be here much earlier

19:19.719 --> 19:24.393
and explain to you much more about Sahaja Yoga.

19:30.335 --> 19:35.467
Sahaja; Saha means with, ja means born.

19:43.722 --> 19:48.475
Yoga means union with the Divine with the Ruh (spirit).

19:54.392 --> 19:58.383
So, all the human beings

19:58.406 --> 20:00.983
whatever race they will belong to

20:01.008 --> 20:04.438
have a right to achieve this stage.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.411
May God bless you all.

20:16.948 --> 20:19.771
If you want to ask me some questions,

20:19.796 --> 20:23.228
I will be very happy to answer them.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.107
Audience: I would like to ask a question.

20:43.131 --> 20:48.085
She just expressed that throughout history,
important personalities

20:48.110 --> 20:51.918
have been murdered because of
what they had said.

21:11.612 --> 21:13.300
Audience: Why did they get murdered?

21:13.325 --> 21:14.491
Audience:She gave an example.

21:14.516 --> 21:17.700
She said that Socrates was murdered
becasue of his words.

21:17.725 --> 21:20.875
She said that Hazrat Isa Aleyhissellam
had been murdered;

21:20.900 --> 21:23.611
although I do not agree with this,

21:23.636 --> 21:26.699
I wonder for which of his words was

21:26.699 --> 21:30.937
Hazrat Mohammad Aleyhisselam was murdered.

21:52.741 --> 21:56.416
Shri Mataji: No. He was supposed to be killed in the sense that

21:56.441 --> 22:00.452
you see, whatever he try to preach and

22:00.477 --> 22:05.163
try to do, people would not listen to him

22:05.188 --> 22:10.608
and he had to really struggle a lot all his life.

22:27.302 --> 22:30.318
Audience: So there is no real act of murder,

22:37.954 --> 22:42.244
Shri Mataji: No. Not that way.
That part is not important.

22:42.261 --> 22:48.010
What important part is that
what he wanted to established?

22:48.481 --> 22:52.038
In his lifetime, it was very difficult.

22:52.103 --> 22:55.866
Because the people were so ignorant.

23:13.530 --> 23:15.561
Audience: Thank you.

23:19.178 --> 23:22.950
Audience:  Does the human brain work more
in Yoga or in sleep,

23:22.992 --> 23:25.802
is there any difference between these two [unclear]

23:39.588 --> 23:41.091
Shri Mataji: What happens?

23:46.706 --> 23:51.717
Somebody: The energy wakes up during
the sleep or during a yoga section?

23:52.323 --> 23:54.991
Shri Mataji: No during, not during the sleep

23:55.008 --> 23:57.430
but during the yoga section.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.675
It is what should understand
why these great prophets came.

24:05.687 --> 24:08.218
Because they had to help us.

24:08.308 --> 24:11.571
In the same way,
the one who is enlighten,

24:11.596 --> 24:14.073
can only enlighten another person.

24:14.394 --> 24:19.492
Like one light, which is enlighten,
can enlighten.

24:34.257 --> 24:37.884
But that person has to be enlightened,

24:37.934 --> 24:40.960
is the authority that is from God.

24:41.264 --> 24:43.988
That he should be enlightened blinds.

24:44.013 --> 24:47.275
Blind people cannot give light.

24:58.050 --> 25:06.438
Audience: Had Buddha found his true
self and become a mystic?

25:06.904 --> 25:08.622
Does she agree with that?

25:08.666 --> 25:17.053
Audience:  Yes, had he found his true self
and achieved the true state of mysticism?

25:27.090 --> 25:29.050
Shri Mataji: Yes, he did. One,

25:29.121 --> 25:32.385
exceptional case, he proofed the Ruh.

25:38.832 --> 25:43.389
Actually, it was the grace of God
which worked on him

25:43.414 --> 25:48.573
and he was so, so desperate.

25:49.917 --> 25:56.062
And he had reached the state where
he would have committed suicide if he hadn’t.

26:05.090 --> 26:08.736
And when you are enlighten,
you can enlighten others.

26:08.776 --> 26:11.960
You all have all the powers to you enlighten others.

26:11.962 --> 26:15.344
Like I really don’t do it much.

26:15.353 --> 26:20.936
All of them here who are sitting are,
all I would say, can do it.

26:39.259 --> 26:45.063
If that is your capacity that is
your power today. Why not have it.

26:52.856 --> 26:54.900
For, you cannot pay for it.

26:54.925 --> 26:59.577
You cannot do anything about it.
Effortlessly you get it. Why not have it.

27:10.613 --> 27:15.518
It is so simple as that.
Today we went in the Bazaar.

27:15.842 --> 27:22.382
And there was a Armenian boy
who was selling us something.

27:22.618 --> 27:25.490
Then he said who are you?

27:25.816 --> 27:29.755
I said, I have come here to give self-realization.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.841
He said can you give me now?
I said yes.

27:34.026 --> 27:38.192
He just puts his hands towards me
and said,  “ooh I am feeling the cool breeze.”

28:20.087 --> 28:21.884
So he wanted to thank me.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.425
I said, this is your own what I have done.

28:24.435 --> 28:26.522
Why did thanking me?

28:36.075 --> 28:38.543
This all built-in in you it has got.

28:38.559 --> 28:41.735
Alright, tomorrow you will do
this to the others.

28:53.251 --> 28:56.689
Audience: Is Yoga only good for
bringing peace in this world?

28:56.714 --> 29:00.104
What are her thoughts about the hereafter?

29:32.095 --> 29:35.689
Shri Mataji: See, I have decided
not to talk about myself.

29:35.732 --> 29:41.546
The reason is, see now,
because all of them talked

29:41.564 --> 29:45.406
and said often, like Christ,

29:45.415 --> 29:48.599
he said, “I am the son of God”

29:49.064 --> 29:54.646
and everything he talked is of truth,
so what did they do to them.

30:11.168 --> 30:13.764
But I must be something no doubt.

30:13.789 --> 30:15.748
I must be knowing something.

30:15.757 --> 30:20.068
But is better, you know yourself,
then you know me better.

30:34.765 --> 30:37.320
Audience: Can anyone achieve this task?

30:48.556 --> 30:50.635
Shri Mataji: Yes of course.

30:51.302 --> 30:54.280
Anyone who has got enlightenment.

30:59.592 --> 31:01.965
Audience: Just a moment,
I would like to say a couple of things.

31:01.990 --> 31:06.017
From all your speech
and the questions of the participants,

31:06.041 --> 31:09.725
I gather that, this meeting gives the sense that,

31:09.775 --> 31:13.533
it excludes other religions,
I think that,

31:13.565 --> 31:16.489
this is how it’s being narrated right now.

31:16.505 --> 31:21.476
I kindly request Her to explain
if this is the case.

31:48.833 --> 31:51.612
Shri Mataji: Of course. It proves.

31:51.637 --> 31:55.090
It proves that  truth, of course.

32:02.816 --> 32:04.244
Of course. Of course.

32:08.432 --> 32:10.812
All religions are true.
No doubt about it

32:10.822 --> 32:14.075
but we have done mistakes.
That is the point I am saying.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.512
Audience: This is what I wanted to explain;

32:26.544 --> 32:28.378
that all religions are true,

32:28.394 --> 32:30.762
that all of them express the reality

32:30.772 --> 32:34.607
but that we make errors while trying
to understand the religions.

32:34.623 --> 32:39.215
So, with your explanation right now,
I should presume that you are trying to fix this;

32:39.240 --> 32:43.411
based on your explanation.
Is this own I should presume?

32:43.436 --> 32:52.350
So all of these other religions are in a chaos, [UNCLEAR]

32:52.375 --> 33:01.700
but because of this now
we […] they find explanations like yoga.

33:11.877 --> 33:14.900
Audience: Can she tell a bit about the tree of life?

33:24.547 --> 33:26.707
Shri Mataji: I mean tomorrow definitely.

33:26.732 --> 33:29.051
I will explain to each and everything.

33:29.067 --> 33:33.571
There is going to be no secret
about this knowledge of the roots.

33:33.598 --> 33:36.200
This is the knowledge of the roots.

33:36.225 --> 33:40.650
Only we have to become subtle, to feel it.

33:43.553 --> 33:46.180
Everything, everything.

33:50.561 --> 33:54.616
But this knowledge is love, is compassion.

34:03.853 --> 34:06.456
Audience:  What is the thing about Sahaja Yoga

34:06.481 --> 34:08.323
that distinguishes it from
the other methods.

34:08.348 --> 34:12.081
I would like her to give an explanation.
If you wish […]

34:21.775 --> 34:24.108
Shri Mataji: other yogas?

34:24.133 --> 34:27.964
Shri Mataji: See. That way, all other yogas

34:27.988 --> 34:32.757
are actually an integral part of Sahaja Yoga.

34:39.787 --> 34:45.392
If you do say Hatha Yoga,
in that also, it is first of all, the cleansing

34:45.400 --> 34:48.816
this that and all that and then
you reach a point

34:48.840 --> 34:51.937
where you have to take realization.

34:59.179 --> 35:04.134
Allright. Now, the second is
you can say, Raja Yoga and all that

35:04.157 --> 35:07.558
the way they preach is artificial.

35:23.237 --> 35:25.236
Like in Raja Yoga,

35:25.253 --> 35:32.108
they say that, you should take
your tongue backwards

35:32.133 --> 35:36.573
and you should put your stomach
tight and all those things.

35:36.598 --> 35:40.401
But when kundalini rises,
automatically it happens.

35:40.434 --> 35:42.481
You don’t have to do it.

36:01.174 --> 36:03.443
Like when your car starts,

36:03.468 --> 36:06.906
all the machinery starts moving automatically.

36:06.931 --> 36:10.085
But supposing, you just take
the wheel and start moving,

36:10.110 --> 36:11.911
the car won’t move.

36:28.527 --> 36:36.255
So, one has to understand that
yoga means; union with the divine.

36:41.923 --> 36:45.708
Now, the difference is that in modern times ,

36:45.733 --> 36:48.151
nobody has time to go to Himalaya

36:48.176 --> 36:51.698
and sit there for hours together, cleansing themselves.

37:01.356 --> 37:04.181
So, I have found a method.

37:04.213 --> 37:07.485
By which first of all raise your kundalini.

37:18.795 --> 37:20.883
And most of you, I am surprised,

37:20.908 --> 37:23.821
you get your realization for fix that moment.

37:34.487 --> 37:37.701
But supposing, somebody do not get it fixed.

37:37.717 --> 37:40.870
Then they can see in that little light,
what is wrong with them

37:40.881 --> 37:44.985
and they improve themselves.
I don’t have to tell them.

37:56.493 --> 37:58.913
So you become your own master.

38:04.058 --> 38:07.012
Audience:  In the transcendental meditation technique,

38:07.037 --> 38:09.267
when people access a certain consciousness,

38:09.292 --> 38:12.579
they rise a couple of centimeters from the ground.

38:23.164 --> 38:25.468
Shri Mataji: No. It is all, it is not true.

38:25.484 --> 38:27.015
It is falsehood.

38:28.501 --> 38:33.522
You see, first, you must know that
anybody who takes money from you

38:33.547 --> 38:37.375
in the name of religion,
in the name of yoga, in anything,

38:37.400 --> 38:40.742
is a false guru.

38:52.655 --> 38:55.140
I don’t mind, even they being cheats,

38:55.165 --> 38:59.127
but not only they cheat you,
not only they cheat you,

38:59.152 --> 39:01.337
but they spoil your kundalini

39:01.362 --> 39:04.634
and they spoil your chances of realization.

39:04.659 --> 39:09.272
We had about only 4 or 5 people only yesterday,

39:09.285 --> 39:11.896
who came to us from this TM.

39:11.906 --> 39:15.485
Who poor things have become recluses.

39:28.964 --> 39:30.217
Also logically,

39:31.515 --> 39:33.644
logically we should understand

39:33.660 --> 39:36.652
what is there to get up from the body

39:36.676 --> 39:39.766
and to move about. What is the sense?

39:48.406 --> 39:49.708
What is the advantage?

39:49.724 --> 39:52.763
We have to two legs to walk.
What is the need?

39:53.242 --> 39:54.479
It is stupid.

40:00.021 --> 40:03.746
All this kind of funny things,

40:03.771 --> 40:07.065
if they tell you,
why should you believe them?

40:13.756 --> 40:16.853
No scripture has talked about it.

40:20.624 --> 40:22.957
There should be some bases.

40:28.266 --> 40:31.877
Audience:  I am sorry,
here is our friend’s question:

40:31.902 --> 40:35.073
there is this one yoga in India,
Marashi Marashi,

40:35.097 --> 40:37.098
their students are doing this thing

40:37.123 --> 40:40.505
but this esteemed lady is saying
that it’s fake.

40:53.765 --> 40:56.066
Shri Mataji: (UNCLEAR) I have nothing to do with him.

40:58.382 --> 41:00.645
Go and see his bank balance. That is all.

41:10.316 --> 41:11.823
Please be careful.

41:11.866 --> 41:15.724
Please be careful. I am sorry.
They are Indians, I know.

41:15.771 --> 41:19.162
I know, they are Indians.
I am very sorry for that.

41:19.267 --> 41:22.174
That is why, I am here to tell you the truth.

41:34.589 --> 41:37.335
I have to I would like to warn also.

41:43.287 --> 41:48.290
I have talked about them in 1970,
very openly.

41:55.016 --> 41:57.055
Very openly.

41:58.416 --> 42:02.408
But still people, I don’t know how
they take to him. Because

42:02.449 --> 42:06.897
he says that he can make people pay,

42:06.922 --> 42:09.772
so people are happy,
I think to pay.

42:19.692 --> 42:22.588
Thousands of seekers are ruined.

42:35.312 --> 42:37.225
Audience: In short, does she mean fake?

42:37.250 --> 42:40.185
Shri Mataji:  Now one more question and no more. Allright?

42:41.666 --> 42:44.406
Because it is getting late now.

42:45.169 --> 42:48.537
Audience: I am one of the people who use this technique,

42:48.562 --> 42:52.777
they took the money but I am very
satisfied with this technique.

42:52.780 --> 42:56.028
Until now I had a very stressful life.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.395
It had an extremely positive impact.

43:19.586 --> 43:21.118
Audience:  There was a mistranslation.

43:21.143 --> 43:22.976
Audience:  I use TM

43:23.023 --> 43:26.888
Interpreter: Aa, I am sorry.
I made a mistake. I am sorry.

43:30.565 --> 43:32.533
Shri Mataji: I am surprise.

43:32.549 --> 43:36.596
Interpreter:  The lady meant transcendental meditation.

43:36.613 --> 43:37.700
Shri Mataji: Of course, I know.

43:37.774 --> 43:41.171
Interpreter:   But she claims that she is quite happy.

43:41.201 --> 43:45.491
I mean, she has been able to redeem
all the stress she had.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.036
Shri Mataji: Alright. Then it is alright.

43:47.061 --> 43:50.548
If she thinks so, but I can tell you this much,
that please don’t come back to me

43:50.573 --> 43:52.937
when you will have problem.

43:58.694 --> 44:01.727
Moreover, you see.
What power she has?

44:01.744 --> 44:03.594
What has she learned?

44:03.602 --> 44:05.985
Can she give realization to anyone?

44:06.010 --> 44:06.875
It is the point.

44:06.882 --> 44:09.748
What is the great transformations she has got ?

44:23.705 --> 44:27.154
You see, the mantras,
this gentleman is giving,

44:27.179 --> 44:29.448
because you don’t know sanskrit.

44:29.731 --> 44:32.254
(UNCLEAR) one is tinga,

44:32.279 --> 44:34.987
pinga, inga. These are not sanskrit.

44:35.013 --> 44:36.965
He doesn’t know sanskrit, this man.

44:45.225 --> 44:48.963
Tinga means, tinga means when
you show somebody like this.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.933
What do you say it in your language?

44:50.958 --> 44:51.958
Thump

44:52.013 --> 44:53.427
That is tinga.

44:53.435 --> 44:54.881
That is the mantra, he gives

44:54.921 --> 44:59.431
and 300 pound he charges
for giving such a stupid mantras.

45:07.015 --> 45:12.993
And another one he gives is inga,
meaning sting of the scorpion.

45:19.353 --> 45:24.261
And pinga means when you get possessed,

45:24.286 --> 45:27.335
you go round and round like that.
You see that is pinga.

45:36.229 --> 45:39.903
I am sorry. I,
I am not with that, at all.

45:44.095 --> 45:45.499
Audience: I hadn’t asked my question.

45:47.255 --> 45:49.160
I just shared my own experience.

45:49.185 --> 45:51.266
What I am trying to ask is this:

45:51.291 --> 45:53.546
the technique that they teach in the society

45:53.571 --> 45:56.208
is the special meditation technique of a caste

45:56.233 --> 45:59.537
that’s founded on veda science
that has been applied since 2000 BC.

45:59.562 --> 46:05.050
When you apply this technique in return
for money, is this a right or wrong thing?

46:37.834 --> 46:40.659
Shri Mataji:I can give you a complete story about,

46:40.667 --> 46:42.438
if you come and see me.

46:42.463 --> 46:46.265
That they started  of course in which people were

46:46.290 --> 46:49.827
stool to be jumping.I have got a

46:49.852 --> 46:54.290
whole coming sorf of a letter from that gentleman

46:54.305 --> 46:56.211
whom I have cured also.

46:56.323 --> 47:00.467
And they started course in Scotland.

47:00.492 --> 47:04.439
His name was Mr Pitapirs and his wife.

47:04.467 --> 47:06.659
She was the granddaughter of a duke.

47:06.675 --> 47:11.066
And they became bankrupt
and epileptic, 3 of them.

47:11.091 --> 47:14.879
And I have to keep them in
my own house, to treat them.

47:14.914 --> 47:16.709
And I have got a letter from them.

47:16.734 --> 47:19.282
So I mean this is what I am saying that,

47:19.305 --> 47:22.252
they go to any guru, let them go.
But then don’t come back to me.

47:22.277 --> 47:23.865
Because I headache for them.

48:01.867 --> 48:05.281
I will send you his letter.
You can see it.

48:06.564 --> 48:10.461
Now poor man, he became bankrupt
and he has gone to South Africa.

48:22.112 --> 48:24.622
And he is told me that he used to tell that,

48:24.638 --> 48:28.448
he could pass through the wall he could jump up

48:28.473 --> 48:31.650
in the air, then all lies.

48:31.674 --> 48:34.502
Because he puts so much money in it.

48:47.449 --> 48:49.433
Audience: Also in the society, I am saying this in parentheses,
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

48:49.458 --> 48:51.090
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

48:51.115 --> 48:53.921
Shri Mataji: Alright now we don’t want to anymore of this TM.

48:56.073 --> 49:00.091
Now let it be now.
Let us have the realization part.

49:00.576 --> 49:01.417
Better.

49:01.481 --> 49:02.877
Audience: Excuse me can I have your attention?

49:02.909 --> 49:07.247
How are we going to learn this
system of yoga and how we can apply this?

49:07.271 --> 49:09.002
Interpreter:  We will show tomorrow.

49:09.027 --> 49:11.010
Interpreter: Tomorrow,

49:11.636 --> 49:12.414
Let us have this please.

49:12.439 --> 49:13.958
Interpreter: It got late now.

49:15.264 --> 49:18.124
Audience:We can’t do tomorrow, it will be too crowded.

49:19.283 --> 49:23.522
Interpreter:  He has worried that
tomorrow session will be too crowded

49:23.541 --> 49:26.731
and they may not be able to get  realisation.

49:26.753 --> 49:28.382
Shri Mataji: get realization.
So let us have the realization

49:28.406 --> 49:31.350
that what I am saying,
you are reel seekers.

49:43.356 --> 49:46.895
Very simple it is. Very simple.

49:47.086 --> 49:49.498
Alright. Now, just think that

49:49.525 --> 49:52.099
we have to use the power of the mother earth

49:52.124 --> 49:55.728
so we have to take out our shoes. That is all.

49:56.386 --> 49:57.792
Take out our shoes.

50:04.022 --> 50:07.009
As we take out for any ibadet in centers.

50:17.295 --> 50:19.527
And have we put our hands for namaz.

50:19.551 --> 50:22.783
Namaz, the thing, Mohammed sahib told you,

50:22.808 --> 50:25.595
it was all kundalini awakening. It was all.

50:37.603 --> 50:39.824
Just, everything.

50:40.289 --> 50:42.194
Now.

50:47.860 --> 50:49.923
Now before you close your eyes,

50:49.939 --> 50:52.766
I will tell you, how to help your centers

50:52.791 --> 50:55.784
which are on left hand side. We will work out.

51:02.296 --> 51:04.343
Very simple it is.

51:07.101 --> 51:10.063
First, you have put your left hand towards me

51:10.072 --> 51:13.701
which is symbolically.
This is the power of desire.

51:13.719 --> 51:16.346
So you want to have your realization.

51:22.859 --> 51:25.501
Now so, left hand towards me like this,

51:25.518 --> 51:28.932
simple and the right hand on your heart.

51:28.966 --> 51:32.275
Because in the heart resides your spirit.

51:35.094 --> 51:38.340
Left towards me, left, left, left hand towards me.

51:38.365 --> 51:42.018
Right, right hand on the heart.

51:43.726 --> 51:46.182
Right, right.
Alright,

51:46.412 --> 51:51.601
Now, then this is the center where the spirit resides.

51:56.904 --> 52:02.657
Now you have to put your hand in the upper part of
your abdomen on the left hand side.

52:09.989 --> 52:12.195
And then you have to put your right hand

52:12.220 --> 52:16.546
in the lower part of your abdomen
on the left hand side, again.

52:22.422 --> 52:29.799
Now the upper part of your abdomen
is the center of your mastery.

52:30.506 --> 52:32.596
Of your mastery.

52:50.356 --> 52:54.371
Now, in the lower part of your abdomen, on the left hand side,

52:54.422 --> 52:59.057
is the center of pure knowledge which

52:59.434 --> 53:03.008
manifests through your central nervous system.

53:14.915 --> 53:17.811
Now,  you put your hand again

53:17.846 --> 53:20.877
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side

53:20.893 --> 53:23.639
which is the center of our mastery.

53:32.222 --> 53:35.650
Now, you put your right hand, again on the heart

53:35.664 --> 53:37.700
which is the spirit.

53:43.868 --> 53:48.114
Now, the center between the neck

53:48.139 --> 53:51.453
and your shoulder, in the corner,

53:51.478 --> 53:55.574
you put your hand and turn your head to your right.

54:02.862 --> 54:07.392
Now, this is the center, we catch,
when we feel guilty.

54:12.257 --> 54:15.201
You should be very pleasantly place toward yourself,

54:15.226 --> 54:20.386
after all you are a human being and if you commit mistakes,

54:20.421 --> 54:23.549
after all you are not God.

54:38.140 --> 54:43.943
Now, you put your hand on your forehead
across, and press it hard.

54:48.453 --> 54:52.627
This is the center of forgiveness.

54:58.043 --> 55:02.384
Now you put your right hand on the backside of your head

55:02.409 --> 55:04.759
and push behind your head.

55:10.867 --> 55:17.218
This is the center of asking for
forgiveness without feeling guilty.

55:25.031 --> 55:26.896
Now stretch your hand

55:28.229 --> 55:32.971
and put the center of your hand on top of your head,

55:33.585 --> 55:38.231
bend your head,
push back your fingers

55:38.585 --> 55:43.698
and move your scalp slowly, seven times.

55:43.740 --> 55:50.934
Because there are seven seats of
the seven centers in your brain.

55:58.138 --> 56:00.090
Stretch back your fingers.

56:10.049 --> 56:14.040
Now just we have to do it by closing our eyes.

56:14.065 --> 56:17.581
You can take out your spectacles.
You have to sit properly.

56:27.173 --> 56:30.426
Keep the legs apart from each other.

56:30.492 --> 56:35.264
Not to sit in a way that you are slouching

56:35.289 --> 56:39.988
or too much strain but in a natural, normal, straight.

56:50.554 --> 56:54.474
Now please close your eyes and don’t open them, till I tell you.

57:00.446 --> 57:03.358
Now, please put the left hand towards me.

57:07.421 --> 57:10.442
And right hand, on the heart.

57:13.717 --> 57:15.146
Please close your eyes.

57:17.585 --> 57:22.486
Here, you have to say

57:22.750 --> 57:27.047
and ask a question to me 3 times.

57:27.154 --> 57:29.408
It is a very important question.

57:29.416 --> 57:32.823
Mother, am I the spirit?

57:43.339 --> 57:44.592
3 times.

58:02.016 --> 58:04.915
If you are the spirit,
you are your guide,

58:04.940 --> 58:07.177
you are your master.

58:07.399 --> 58:09.499
So please put this right hand

58:09.515 --> 58:12.462
in the upper portion of your abdomen

58:12.487 --> 58:15.606
and press it hard the left hand side

58:15.649 --> 58:17.839
and ask me a question.

58:29.055 --> 58:31.809
Here you ask me a question again 3 times.

58:32.833 --> 58:37.194
Mother, am I my own master?

58:37.196 --> 58:40.339
Call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever suites you.

58:57.649 --> 59:01.617
Now, take down your hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen

59:02.567 --> 59:05.336
and press it hard.

59:08.827 --> 59:15.117
Here, I have to respect your freedom.

59:18.251 --> 59:21.425
And I can not force pure knowledge on you.

59:25.067 --> 59:28.622
So, you have to ask me, in your own freedom.

59:31.248 --> 59:33.653
Please say 6 times.

59:33.717 --> 59:38.879
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

59:49.220 --> 59:50.997
Now,

59:53.561 --> 59:55.618
when you ask this question,

59:55.643 --> 01:00:00.034
this force of Kundalini starts rising.

01:00:23.334 --> 01:00:25.746
Now, raise your hand

01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:32.767
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side and press it hard.

01:00:38.446 --> 01:00:40.382
As the kundalini is raising,

01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:45.505
we have to help with our confident,
our centers to open out.

01:00:54.055 --> 01:00:57.405
Here you have to say 10 times

01:00:57.430 --> 01:01:02.029
Because there are 10 petals to this center.

01:01:11.028 --> 01:01:13.837
With full confidence say,

01:01:14.663 --> 01:01:20.127
Mother, I am my own master.
Say it 10 times.

01:01:27.903 --> 01:01:31.427
This center is created by own prophets.

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:46.552
Now, one has to know

01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:49.144
that, we are not this body.

01:01:49.162 --> 01:01:52.876
We are not this mind.

01:01:53.111 --> 01:01:55.753
We are not ego.

01:02:04.394 --> 01:02:06.838
We are not our conditionings

01:02:06.862 --> 01:02:10.396
but we are pure spirit.

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:21.256
So, now, raise your hand onto your heart.

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:29.950
And say with full confidence,

01:02:32.527 --> 01:02:35.709
the most important truth about yourself,

01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:46.105
Mother, I am the spirit.
Say this 12 times.

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:12.374
Now, raise your right hand,

01:03:15.175 --> 01:03:24.408
into the corner of your neck
and your shoulder.

01:03:29.403 --> 01:03:32.426
One has to know

01:03:33.095 --> 01:03:37.216
that Divine is the power

01:03:38.213 --> 01:03:43.516
of bliss and joy.

01:03:50.022 --> 01:03:51.022
But above all,

01:03:54.932 --> 01:04:00.209
above, above all it is the power of forgiveness.

01:04:07.015 --> 01:04:09.959
So whatever so called mistakes,
you have committed

01:04:09.984 --> 01:04:14.358
then be dissolved completely into that power.

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.656
So please turn your face to the right.

01:04:28.692 --> 01:04:31.926
Symbolically saying that,

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:36.061
Mother, I am not guilty.
Say it 16 times.

01:04:59.184 --> 01:05:03.637
Now, raise your right hand

01:05:03.662 --> 01:05:06.883
onto your forehead across and press it hard.

01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:16.693
You may bend your head.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.373
Here is the center to forgive.

01:05:26.571 --> 01:05:28.951
You forgive everyone.

01:05:32.689 --> 01:05:38.619
So please say with full confidence,

01:05:39.043 --> 01:05:42.781
Mother, I forgive everyone.

01:05:51.828 --> 01:05:55.589
Many people say that is difficult to forgive.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:06:00.792
But whether you forgive
or you don’t forgive, it is a myth.

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:13.357
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:06:18.817 --> 01:06:23.046
So please say from your heart,

01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:25.804
Mother I forgive everyone.

01:06:33.237 --> 01:06:38.301
Now, take your right hand

01:06:38.326 --> 01:06:40.406
on the backside of your head

01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:44.152
and allow your head to rest on it.

01:06:52.132 --> 01:06:54.727
Here without feeling guilty,

01:06:54.752 --> 01:07:00.277
without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction.

01:07:09.262 --> 01:07:11.944
Please say,

01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:18.813
O Divine, If I have done
anything wrong, please forgive me.

01:07:28.886 --> 01:07:30.242
From your heart.

01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:38.918
Now stretch your palm and

01:07:41.129 --> 01:07:45.429
put the center of your palm on top of your head.

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:51.389
On soft bone which was in your childhood.

01:07:56.747 --> 01:07:58.722
Push back your fingers.

01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:06.729
Now again, I can not force on you,
self realization.

01:08:13.727 --> 01:08:17.433
So now bend your head and say 7 times

01:08:17.441 --> 01:08:24.891
moving your hand with pressure
your scalp, clockwise.

01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:38.741
Mother please give me self realization.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:46.577
Please move 7 times.

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:33.303
Now take down your hands.

01:09:36.092 --> 01:09:40.881
Put both the hands towards me
and open our eyes slowly.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:53.920
Now just see, if you are thoughtless,
you can't see any thought.

01:09:58.089 --> 01:10:03.376
Now, bend your head and put your right hand towards me.

01:10:08.839 --> 01:10:14.309
And left hand you try to feel
cool breeze out of your head.

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:34.323
Now, put the and again put the head down

01:10:34.348 --> 01:10:37.364
and put the left hand towards me.

01:10:39.976 --> 01:10:43.476
And with the right hand see again,
if there is a cool breeze coming,

01:10:43.492 --> 01:10:45.547
could be hot also.

01:10:56.311 --> 01:11:01.032
Now, put the right hand again towards me

01:11:01.057 --> 01:11:05.125
and see with the left hand if there is
a cool breeze coming out of you.

01:11:13.479 --> 01:11:17.118
Now put your hands up in the sky,

01:11:17.143 --> 01:11:22.810
like that towards the sky, push back
your head and ask a question.

01:11:24.299 --> 01:11:29.975
Is this the all pervading power of God?

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.715
Is this the Ruh?

01:11:43.615 --> 01:11:47.225
Is this the power of love

01:11:53.578 --> 01:11:55.847
Now take down your hands

01:11:59.734 --> 01:12:01.750
You all will feel very relaxed.

01:12:05.637 --> 01:12:08.771
Now those who are felt the cool breeze of their head

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:11.750
and in your hands,

01:12:17.052 --> 01:12:20.298
like this, so you can feel in the hand of others also,

01:12:21.478 --> 01:12:22.545
neighbor’s head.

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:28.497
Here also, here.

01:12:29.614 --> 01:12:32.113
All of you felt it I know.

01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:35.259
So raise your hand, let’s see, both the hands.

01:12:39.196 --> 01:12:42.052
Those who are felt  is this, raise your hands.

01:12:49.944 --> 01:12:51.602
May God Bless you all.

01:12:51.636 --> 01:12:54.025
So many of you are felt it.

01:12:58.311 --> 01:13:01.001
Tomorrow again you are coming here

01:13:01.034 --> 01:13:03.343
And we are going to establish it fully.

01:13:07.305 --> 01:13:10.130
You will feel very joyus, very happy.

01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:18.242
Tomorrow (UNCLEAR).

01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:29.610
I hope, you will bring your friends.

01:13:33.412 --> 01:13:36.490
You feel very relax, very happy.

01:13:40.476 --> 01:13:42.785
Especially,  I have seen muslims,

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:46.518
they receiving very fast.

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:56.417
Got it, I know you got it.

01:13:58.628 --> 01:14:01.130
Alright. So, please come tomorrow

01:14:01.138 --> 01:14:04.812
and don’t discuss it.
Because this is beyond your thought.

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:08.976
Audience: What time is the meeting tomorrow?

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.448
Interpreter Half past six.

01:14:16.984 --> 01:14:19.662
Shri Mataji:  I will be very early there.

01:14:19.687 --> 01:14:21.924
Tomorrow I hope there is no traffic jam.

01:14:24.071 --> 01:14:26.991
Somebody: Gentleman wants to ask a question, if you don’t mind

01:14:27.016 --> 01:14:30.632
Shri Mataji: Please come. Please come. You can come here.

01:14:30.651 --> 01:14:33.454
Audience: I am asking this so that
everybody can hear.

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:36.529
Shri Mataji: Allright, allright.

01:14:37.079 --> 01:14:47.240
Audience:  First of all, we are happy
to see her here in Istanbul.

01:14:47.265 --> 01:14:49.408
I would like to welcome her.

01:14:55.987 --> 01:15:00.244
I need to express that in the previous questions,

01:15:00.252 --> 01:15:03.914
some concepts were indeed being misunderstood

01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:07.745
and this is because there are a lot of misinformation

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:11.328
and wrong knowledge around these in Turkey.

01:15:26.796 --> 01:15:29.065
Shri Mataji: It is allright but one has to answer.

01:15:29.082 --> 01:15:30.779
In fact this is the first time we are attending a meeting like this

01:15:30.804 --> 01:15:33.490
As Sufis were informed about this but…

01:15:38.013 --> 01:15:40.600
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is alright. See I am a mother.

01:15:40.616 --> 01:15:42.874
So it is alright. Children must ask questions..

01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:47.191
Audience: When we talk about yoga here in Turkey,

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:50.286
maybe she knows about it, there is a famous Yogi Kazim.

01:15:50.302 --> 01:15:53.472
He pokes his body with skewers in circuses and stuff.

01:15:53.488 --> 01:15:55.100
When we say yoga in Turkey,

01:15:55.125 --> 01:15:58.270
everybody expects something like this
because there is such an image.

01:16:25.007 --> 01:16:26.554
Shri Mataji: No, austerities.

01:16:26.586 --> 01:16:30.074
Audience:  For this reason.
When you talk about the yoga technique,

01:16:30.099 --> 01:16:34.449
there are established prejudices bring in
such associations of meaning.

01:16:34.474 --> 01:16:38.230
We listened her and understood that this is not the case

01:16:38.255 --> 01:16:41.418
but this has to be told to everyone in a very explicit way.

01:16:41.434 --> 01:16:42.505
This image must be erased.

01:16:57.343 --> 01:17:01.565
Audience:   So just like the merchants in
every religion and every system,

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:04.317
because they are the merchants if yoga,

01:17:04.342 --> 01:17:09.986
I would kindly ask her to be at ease that
she is not being understood in this way.

01:17:09.994 --> 01:17:11.766
Thank you.

01:17:37.004 --> 01:17:41.614
Shri Mataji: You see, there are no
austerities in Sahaja Yoga.

01:17:41.642 --> 01:17:43.912
No asceticism in Sahaja Yoga.

01:17:50.382 --> 01:17:53.088
No materyalistic life in Sahaja Yoga.

01:17:56.609 --> 01:18:01.269
God has created this world, for you, to enjoy.

01:18:01.293 --> 01:18:03.088
But in the right way.

01:18:10.737 --> 01:18:12.967
He is your father.

01:18:12.991 --> 01:18:16.165
And the greatest of fathers.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.612
And why he did you guide you to be miserable.

01:18:26.714 --> 01:18:31.952
Actually, he is anxious for you
to enter into his Kingdom,

01:18:31.977 --> 01:18:34.049
enjoy his love and blessing.

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:43.308
Thank you very much.

01:18:51.773 --> 01:18:55.844
Beautiful. Very beautiful people.

01:18:56.005 --> 01:19:01.572
You got alright. Now, laugh, enjoy.

01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:55.095
The problem is that, there was no
one here as Sahaja Yogi.

01:19:55.409 --> 01:19:58.408
Now luckily we have a lady

01:19:58.433 --> 01:20:00.609
whose husband got transport.

01:20:00.611 --> 01:20:04.138
See, I could have come much earlier here.

01:20:04.163 --> 01:20:05.934
As I have been another country.

01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:08.134
I have been working now for 18 years

01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:10.953
but there was no one in Turkey.

01:20:11.734 --> 01:20:17.022
So I had to wait for somebody to be here already.

01:20:28.938 --> 01:20:31.532
There is a lady who has got transfer here.

01:20:36.889 --> 01:20:39.801
Now we have here  the lots of people ...

01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:48.297
Thank you.

01:20:48.322 --> 01:20:49.701
Thank you so much.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.846
Thank you my child.

01:20:51.871 --> 01:20:54.292
So happy today

01:20:55.678 --> 01:20:56.811
May God bless you

01:20:59.001 --> 01:21:00.421
May God bless you

01:21:01.567 --> 01:21:02.700
May God bless you

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.631
Look at his eyes. See now his eyes.
Look at his eyes. See.

01:21:24.699 --> 01:21:26.406
Tomorrow hope to see you.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.273
Tomorrow hope to see you madam. Alright

01:21:36.427 --> 01:21:39.070
Thank you. Are you alright.

01:21:45.999 --> 01:21:48.109
Hello, did you feel the cool breeze.

01:21:53.068 --> 01:21:55.139
Audience: Can you please ask what is the meaning?

01:21:55.164 --> 01:21:56.654
I got very curious.

01:21:56.679 --> 01:22:00.212
But there has to be a difference. Can you please ask?

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.842
But there has to be a difference.

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:07.049
Can you please ask?

01:22:16.512 --> 01:22:21.045
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much.

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:24.415
Interpreter:  The gentleman would like
to know what exactly is different

01:22:24.423 --> 01:22:27.550
that he felt heat instead of cool breeze.

01:22:27.592 --> 01:22:29.279
Shri Mataji: Still you are feeling.

01:22:29.304 --> 01:22:32.700
Little heat in the body instead always
and now they said you can see here.

01:22:32.702 --> 01:22:35.077
If you can see here becoming softer, here.

01:22:35.102 --> 01:22:37.928
And through this all the heat is coming out.

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:39.365
Let the heat get out.

01:22:39.376 --> 01:22:42.528
And heat will get out.
And you will feel cool better.

01:22:42.536 --> 01:22:47.239
Because in the body, in the system
they said heat will (UNCLEAR) go which is together.

01:22:47.249 --> 01:22:49.305
And (UNCLEAR) due to liver.

01:22:55.808 --> 01:22:58.673
And also he has to forgive.

01:22:58.689 --> 01:23:01.495
He has to forgive.
I think he didn’t forgive fully.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.631
So please forgive.

01:23:06.439 --> 01:23:09.096
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

01:23:09.187 --> 01:23:15.021
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

01:23:18.322 --> 01:23:22.910
See now. You not forgive. He did not forgive.

01:23:23.185 --> 01:23:25.002
He did not forgive.

01:23:25.522 --> 01:23:27.331
Interpreter:  Nice to see you.

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:30.117

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:38.300
