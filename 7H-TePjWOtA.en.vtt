WEBVTT

01:58.712 --> 02:07.677
Today is a special day. There is
a combination of two things happening.

02:07.878 --> 02:12.427
[First I will speak in English then
Marathi].

02:12.709 --> 02:18.856
Today is first in the morning time,
at 8:50 in the morning,

02:19.057 --> 02:25.250
was a very important date that started
at 8:50 in the morning,

02:25.451 --> 02:29.048
called as Ratha Saptami – is the seventh
day.

02:29.249 --> 02:35.618
And it is said that the Sun travels

02:39.637 --> 02:49.537
with his seven forces,

02:49.746 --> 02:57.728
or say, seven colours in a big chariot.

02:57.929 --> 03:02.508
And today they celebrate this day
as a day when

03:02.709 --> 03:08.978
the Sun travels with the divine vibrations
all over the world, and illumines.

03:09.179 --> 03:17.015
But it was too early for anyone of you
to do this, so till -

03:17.216 --> 03:23.463
I got up very early of course, and worked
out that part for you.

03:23.721 --> 03:27.845
The second important thing which is
a combination,

03:28.046 --> 03:35.250
which is a very, very auspicious thing –
that you get on one day, two dates.

03:35.450 --> 03:39.754
One is Ratha Saptami, on that day
you cannot do havana,

03:39.955 --> 03:43.205
because it is the Surya already is there.

03:43.406 --> 03:46.020
So the second thing is, [which] today
we do,

03:46.221 --> 03:51.921
is a very great puja of Ashtami
(eighth day):

03:52.122 --> 03:57.178
is the day when the Goddess killed

03:57.379 --> 04:02.512
nine rakshasas together with Her eight
hands.

04:02.713 --> 04:04.848
So today is a very special day

04:05.049 --> 04:08.661
for which a very special attention
is needed.

04:08.862 --> 04:13.001
It’s only at the behest of the bhaktas

04:13.202 --> 04:17.942
that the Goddess took Her form and killed
all these rakshasas.

04:18.143 --> 04:25.105
Also with Her eight hands, She killed
Mahishasura.

04:25.306 --> 04:29.645
That’s why She is called as Mahishasura
Mardini. She is called as Nava Chandi,

04:29.846 --> 04:34.016
the One who has killed nine Chandas,
means nine rakshasas She has killed.

04:34.217 --> 04:39.162
So is a very important day, and very vital,
and very deep.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.594
It’s very simple to say, “Mother, we have
fixed

04:41.795 --> 04:44.517
Your puja on such and such day.”

04:44.718 --> 04:49.649
Nobody thinks what Mother has to work
behind the whole thing, you see.

04:49.850 --> 04:52.724
You can’t fix My puja. It’s not proper.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.840
It is I who can tell you what time is
the best for you to do the puja.

04:57.041 --> 05:03.324
So it starts at two minutes past twelve.

05:03.525 --> 05:06.889
So now we can start it, and that’s why
do I delayed My bath.

05:07.090 --> 05:11.636
But that would be too late, so I started
My bath little early.

05:11.837 --> 05:18.542
[Marathi aside] Then only we can do it.

05:18.743 --> 05:20.428
So today is the day of the Goddess,

05:20.629 --> 05:22.342
a very important day that you are here.

05:22.543 --> 05:25.617
Somehow we are having all the pujas
on 9 days,

05:25.818 --> 05:29.236
and that’s why I am wearing this special
type of a sari,

05:29.437 --> 05:34.440
which is to be used for Ashta Bhuja’s
Vahana,

05:34.641 --> 05:38.880
is a tiger as well as a lion.

05:39.080 --> 05:44.304
Imagine where I’m staying, there is
a photograph of a tiger and a lion both,

05:44.505 --> 05:47.819
in that room. You can go and see
for yourself.

05:48.020 --> 05:55.636
Normally you never get these, but that is
there, is a beautiful photograph,

05:55.837 --> 06:01.007
enlarged, of a tiger and a lion.

06:01.208 --> 06:05.233
So in the morning the Surya was
very beautiful,

06:05.434 --> 06:09.980
I don’t know if you saw the morning sun.

06:10.165 --> 06:13.579
At least tomorrow try to see.

06:14.372 --> 06:18.117
It’s not important how long you sleep here,
what food you eat,

06:18.318 --> 06:20.462
whether you get it in time and all that.

06:20.663 --> 06:23.356
You should get rid of these habits.
It’s very important

06:23.557 --> 06:26.370
that these regularities and all these
mundane type of things,

06:26.571 --> 06:28.292
the bounding of timing and all that –

06:28.493 --> 06:30.954
you must get out of it space and time,
everything.

06:31.155 --> 06:33.135
And should not go on worrying about things,

06:33.336 --> 06:37.448
because you get so exhausted, without
doing any work you feel exhausted.

06:37.649 --> 06:41.368
Because you are so fixed up, so fixed up

06:41.569 --> 06:43.669
that you can’t get out of these habits,
you see.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.201
While the Indians are not fixed up
like that,

06:46.402 --> 06:48.227
they know that Mother knows the best,

06:48.428 --> 06:51.409
She will come at the time when the puja
has to be done.

06:51.610 --> 06:56.084
So, one should try to understand that
if I am the One,

06:56.285 --> 06:58.031
then why should you worry?

06:58.232 --> 07:01.983
But I have one problem with the Western
mind,

07:02.184 --> 07:07.198
is that if they cannot conceive it, they’ll
start criticising.

07:07.399 --> 07:11.345
Instead of making yourself subtler and
subtler to conceive

07:11.546 --> 07:13.146
the beauty of the Divine,

07:13.347 --> 07:16.493
if you don’t get it, you will start
criticising on any point,

07:16.694 --> 07:19.749
anything you can get hold of, and you’ll
start criticising.

07:19.950 --> 07:21.727
So that’s not the way we can grow.

07:21.928 --> 07:26.417
That’s why I’m telling you beforehand that
this puja is very important,

07:26.618 --> 07:29.017
and at this puja, you have to request

07:29.218 --> 07:32.650
that these nine Chandas, who are still
there, should be killed

07:32.851 --> 07:37.087
and this Mahishasura also should be killed,
they should be driven out.

07:37.288 --> 07:42.018
And that’s how it is going to work out
and it’s very important.

07:42.219 --> 07:46.594
[It’s] very important, I have to work it
out Myself.

07:46.795 --> 07:49.975
[You] see, it’s not easy just to organise
a programme

07:50.176 --> 07:53.144
like a, preside over something, you just
come along -

07:53.345 --> 07:55.769
it is not that way. It’s much, much deeper,

07:55.970 --> 08:00.481
it has much deeper significance,
much deeper work has to be done.

08:00.682 --> 08:03.902
So many things have to [be] worked out.
It’s a very subtle thing.

08:04.103 --> 08:06.912
And the more you discuss it, the more you
talk about it, you’ll lose it,

08:07.113 --> 08:10.262
you should keep quiet and absorb it.

08:10.463 --> 08:14.549
So today is not a day of such a mundane
type, is very important

08:14.750 --> 08:19.414
in this small place, where we are sitting,
we are doing a tremendous job.

08:19.615 --> 08:23.296
And you people, who have suffered the most
on account of these rakshasas,

08:23.497 --> 08:30.279
should be absolutely intensively be careful
that these sinners must go out.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.584
Something has to be done, instead
of thinking about yourself

08:33.785 --> 08:36.872
and your inconveniences, your troubles and
whatever you call them,

08:37.073 --> 08:40.700
which are not so important at all!

08:41.835 --> 08:46.852
You are saints and you must support
all divine work

08:47.049 --> 08:50.007
by complete understanding.

08:50.208 --> 08:53.139
On the contrary, if you are so much worried
about your own things,

08:53.360 --> 08:56.842
I mean, you are of no use, to yourself
or to Sahaja Yoga.

08:57.043 --> 09:03.024
So I would say that even some people will
see that this happened, that happened.

09:03.225 --> 09:07.418
Perhaps the group is a bit too big
to accommodate in all these places.

09:07.619 --> 09:11.160
I always had a feeling that the group
is increasing a bit too much.

09:11.361 --> 09:14.489
And we didn’t have any idea of so many
people coming in.

09:14.690 --> 09:19.556
But doesn’t matter – they are sharing, we
are settled down, there’s a place to sleep.

09:19.757 --> 09:24.127
And if you can understand this, [you] see,
that these things are not important,

09:24.328 --> 09:27.510
then you go to England and just sleep, or
you go to Australia and just sleep.

09:27.711 --> 09:29.838
I mean, you have all the time to do
all that.

09:30.039 --> 09:35.384
Just now you are here to become subtler
and subtler.

09:37.182 --> 09:42.780
Now the time has started and the Brahmin
also came at the right time

09:42.981 --> 09:49.599
So we have to be one with the subtleties.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.780
Sahaja Yoga is not possible if you want
to see it

09:52.981 --> 09:56.217
from a gross level: you cannot understand
Sahaja Yoga [that way].

09:56.418 --> 09:58.661
I have already told you that without
realisation,

09:58.862 --> 10:00.953
you cannot have Sahaja Yoga.

10:01.154 --> 10:04.125
But even after realisation, if you stick
on to those old things

10:04.326 --> 10:08.619
which belongs to the egg time, you will
have no advantage.

10:08.820 --> 10:14.522
So try to become subtler and subtler,
and don’t think about it.

10:14.723 --> 10:17.938
You will relax, you will feel better,
it will act.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.994
That you should have food at the right
time,

10:20.195 --> 10:23.486
you must have this at the right time,
this should be the food - this is, I mean,

10:23.687 --> 10:27.553
it’s such a stuck up thing, you know.

10:27.754 --> 10:30.555
We cannot be stuck up with food, we
cannot be stuck up with all these things.

10:30.756 --> 10:37.874
You are going to a level where nobody
has reached.

10:40.194 --> 10:44.697
With this understanding if you become
surrendered –

10:44.898 --> 10:47.391
means not to give Me anything,

10:47.592 --> 10:52.732
but to get rid of your ego and your stuck
up ideas which there have been –

10:52.933 --> 10:56.510
it would be a very good thing.

10:57.037 --> 11:01.120
When you discuss also among yourselves,
nobody should discuss inconveniences.

11:01.321 --> 11:05.289
I had told you that in a village it’s
a very difficult thing [indistinct words].

11:05.490 --> 11:06.645
You don’t have to go to Himalayas,

11:06.846 --> 11:09.391
but travelling through India is not
an easy thing.

11:09.592 --> 11:13.162
And I had told all of you, I live with much
more conveniences

11:13.363 --> 11:19.089
and comforts than anyone of you live.
But I can adjust Myself much more,

11:19.290 --> 11:21.537
so you should also try to forget about it.

11:21.738 --> 11:25.978
Don’t talk of your inconveniences. That
will make you very gross.

11:26.179 --> 11:33.521
The one who becomes subtler and subtler
can only achieve something.

16:55.506 --> 16:59.139
Today is another day, is called Bhishma
Ashtami,

16:59.340 --> 17:02.760
is the day when Bhishma, who was a great
saint

17:02.961 --> 17:10.790
who took a great vow and that vow he
carried out all his life.

17:10.991 --> 17:15.400
It was a great vow he took. So today
also is the day of a vow.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.695
He took on an Ashtami day. On the Ashtami
day he took a vow,

17:18.896 --> 17:23.327
so today is another day for you to take
a vow.

17:23.528 --> 17:27.366
So also you should try to take a vow

17:27.567 --> 17:30.644
and with that vow, you should be able

17:30.845 --> 17:35.188
to achieve something which has not been
yet achieved.

17:42.958 --> 17:46.084
This achievement is not only for this
place,

17:46.272 --> 17:53.473
is not only for Maharashtra, it is not only
for India,

17:53.674 --> 17:58.756
it is not only for the whole world, but for
the whole Universe.

17:58.957 --> 18:04.909
So you are playing a very important,
vital role

18:05.110 --> 18:11.072
and one should try to improve one’s
quality of life,

18:11.289 --> 18:13.574
quality of personality.

18:13.775 --> 18:19.433
Unless and until you have that substantial
quality, nothing is going to work out.

18:19.634 --> 18:24.010
This is what I am telling them: that you
must work out

18:24.211 --> 18:29.105
in such a way that you become substantially
dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

18:29.306 --> 18:33.496
Not just for your sake, not just for your
family

18:33.657 --> 18:36.480
or for your country, but for the whole
Universe.

18:36.681 --> 18:48.376
So you are the seeds who are going
to create that great atmosphere

18:48.544 --> 18:59.924
that will bring forth the great change that
we are expecting of Mahayoga.

19:00.125 --> 19:07.792
It is very important to understand that
so many people have talked about this,

19:07.993 --> 19:11.581
and I have come across a book which was
written 2000 years back

19:11.782 --> 19:15.534
which describes about this Mahayoga,

19:15.735 --> 19:17.987
and what is going to happen. It is very
interesting.

19:18.188 --> 19:21.999
After the puja and havan, I think
Mr. Chauhan will translate it to you

19:22.200 --> 19:28.148
and you can understand what it is about.
So let us start now.
