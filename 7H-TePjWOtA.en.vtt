00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:07.677
Today is a special day. There is
a combination of two things happening.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:12.427
[First I will speak in English then
Marathi].

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.856
Today is first in the morning time,
at 8:50 in the morning,

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:25.250
was a very important date that started
at 8:50 in the morning,

00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:29.048
called as Ratha Saptami – is the seventh
day.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:35.618
And it is said that the Sun travels

00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:49.537
with his seven forces,

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:57.728
or say, seven colours in a big chariot.

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:02.508
And today they celebrate this day
as a day when

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.978
the Sun travels with the divine vibrations
all over the world, and illumines.

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:17.015
But it was too early for anyone of you
to do this, so till -

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:23.463
I got up very early of course, and worked
out that part for you.

00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:27.845
The second important thing which is
a combination,

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:35.250
which is a very, very auspicious thing –
that you get on one day, two dates.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.754
One is Ratha Saptami, on that day
you cannot do havana,

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:43.205
because it is the Surya already is there.

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:46.020
So the second thing is, [which] today
we do,

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:51.921
is a very great puja of Ashtami
(eighth day):

00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:57.178
is the day when the Goddess killed

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.512
nine rakshasas together with Her eight
hands.

00:04:02.713 --> 00:04:04.848
So today is a very special day

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.661
for which a very special attention
is needed.

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:13.001
It’s only at the behest of the bhaktas

00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:17.942
that the Goddess took Her form and killed
all these rakshasas.

00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:25.105
Also with Her eight hands, She killed
Mahishasura.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:29.645
That’s why She is called as Mahishasura
Mardini. She is called as Nava Chandi,

00:04:29.846 --> 00:04:34.016
the One who has killed nine Chandas,
means nine rakshasas She has killed.

00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:39.162
So is a very important day, and very vital,
and very deep.

00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:41.594
It’s very simple to say, “Mother, we have
fixed

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:44.517
Your puja on such and such day.”

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:49.649
Nobody thinks what Mother has to work
behind the whole thing, you see.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.724
You can’t fix My puja. It’s not proper.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:56.840
It is I who can tell you what time is
the best for you to do the puja.

00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:03.324
So it starts at two minutes past twelve.

00:05:03.525 --> 00:05:06.889
So now we can start it, and that’s why
do I delayed My bath.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.636
But that would be too late, so I started
My bath little early.

00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:18.542
[Marathi aside] Then only we can do it.

00:05:18.743 --> 00:05:20.428
So today is the day of the Goddess,

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.342
a very important day that you are here.

00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:25.617
Somehow we are having all the pujas
on 9 days,

00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:29.236
and that’s why I am wearing this special
type of a sari,

00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:34.440
which is to be used for Ashta Bhuja’s
Vahana,

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:38.880
is a tiger as well as a lion.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.304
Imagine where I’m staying, there is
a photograph of a tiger and a lion both,

00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:47.819
in that room. You can go and see
for yourself.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.636
Normally you never get these, but that is
there, is a beautiful photograph,

00:05:55.837 --> 00:06:01.007
enlarged, of a tiger and a lion.

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:05.233
So in the morning the Surya was
very beautiful,

00:06:05.434 --> 00:06:09.980
I don’t know if you saw the morning sun.

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:13.579
At least tomorrow try to see.

00:06:14.372 --> 00:06:18.117
It’s not important how long you sleep here,
what food you eat,

00:06:18.318 --> 00:06:20.462
whether you get it in time and all that.

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:23.356
You should get rid of these habits.
It’s very important

00:06:23.557 --> 00:06:26.370
that these regularities and all these
mundane type of things,

00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:28.292
the bounding of timing and all that –

00:06:28.493 --> 00:06:30.954
you must get out of it space and time,
everything.

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:33.135
And should not go on worrying about things,

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:37.448
because you get so exhausted, without
doing any work you feel exhausted.

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:41.368
Because you are so fixed up, so fixed up

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:43.669
that you can’t get out of these habits,
you see.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.201
While the Indians are not fixed up
like that,

00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:48.227
they know that Mother knows the best,

00:06:48.428 --> 00:06:51.409
She will come at the time when the puja
has to be done.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.084
So, one should try to understand that
if I am the One,

00:06:56.285 --> 00:06:58.031
then why should you worry?

00:06:58.232 --> 00:07:01.983
But I have one problem with the Western
mind,

00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:07.198
is that if they cannot conceive it, they’ll
start criticising.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:11.345
Instead of making yourself subtler and
subtler to conceive

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:13.146
the beauty of the Divine,

00:07:13.347 --> 00:07:16.493
if you don’t get it, you will start
criticising on any point,

00:07:16.694 --> 00:07:19.749
anything you can get hold of, and you’ll
start criticising.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.727
So that’s not the way we can grow.

00:07:21.928 --> 00:07:26.417
That’s why I’m telling you beforehand that
this puja is very important,

00:07:26.618 --> 00:07:29.017
and at this puja, you have to request

00:07:29.218 --> 00:07:32.650
that these nine Chandas, who are still
there, should be killed

00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:37.087
and this Mahishasura also should be killed,
they should be driven out.

00:07:37.288 --> 00:07:42.018
And that’s how it is going to work out
and it’s very important.

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:46.594
[It’s] very important, I have to work it
out Myself.

00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:49.975
[You] see, it’s not easy just to organise
a programme

00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:53.144
like a, preside over something, you just
come along -

00:07:53.345 --> 00:07:55.769
it is not that way. It’s much, much deeper,

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.481
it has much deeper significance,
much deeper work has to be done.

00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:03.902
So many things have to [be] worked out.
It’s a very subtle thing.

00:08:04.103 --> 00:08:06.912
And the more you discuss it, the more you
talk about it, you’ll lose it,

00:08:07.113 --> 00:08:10.262
you should keep quiet and absorb it.

00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:14.549
So today is not a day of such a mundane
type, is very important

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.414
in this small place, where we are sitting,
we are doing a tremendous job.

00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:23.296
And you people, who have suffered the most
on account of these rakshasas,

00:08:23.497 --> 00:08:30.279
should be absolutely intensively be careful
that these sinners must go out.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.584
Something has to be done, instead
of thinking about yourself

00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:36.872
and your inconveniences, your troubles and
whatever you call them,

00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:40.700
which are not so important at all!

00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:46.852
You are saints and you must support
all divine work

00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:50.007
by complete understanding.

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:53.139
On the contrary, if you are so much worried
about your own things,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.842
I mean, you are of no use, to yourself
or to Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:57.043 --> 00:09:03.024
So I would say that even some people will
see that this happened, that happened.

00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:07.418
Perhaps the group is a bit too big
to accommodate in all these places.

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:11.160
I always had a feeling that the group
is increasing a bit too much.

00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:14.489
And we didn’t have any idea of so many
people coming in.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.556
But doesn’t matter – they are sharing, we
are settled down, there’s a place to sleep.

00:09:19.757 --> 00:09:24.127
And if you can understand this, [you] see,
that these things are not important,

00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:27.510
then you go to England and just sleep, or
you go to Australia and just sleep.

00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:29.838
I mean, you have all the time to do
all that.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:35.384
Just now you are here to become subtler
and subtler.

00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:42.780
Now the time has started and the Brahmin
also came at the right time

00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:49.599
So we have to be one with the subtleties.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.780
Sahaja Yoga is not possible if you want
to see it

00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:56.217
from a gross level: you cannot understand
Sahaja Yoga [that way].

00:09:56.418 --> 00:09:58.661
I have already told you that without
realisation,

00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:00.953
you cannot have Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:01.154 --> 00:10:04.125
But even after realisation, if you stick
on to those old things

00:10:04.326 --> 00:10:08.619
which belongs to the egg time, you will
have no advantage.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.522
So try to become subtler and subtler,
and don’t think about it.

00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:17.938
You will relax, you will feel better,
it will act.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:19.994
That you should have food at the right
time,

00:10:20.195 --> 00:10:23.486
you must have this at the right time,
this should be the food - this is, I mean,

00:10:23.687 --> 00:10:27.553
it’s such a stuck up thing, you know.

00:10:27.754 --> 00:10:30.555
We cannot be stuck up with food, we
cannot be stuck up with all these things.

00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:37.874
You are going to a level where nobody
has reached.

00:10:40.194 --> 00:10:44.697
With this understanding if you become
surrendered –

00:10:44.898 --> 00:10:47.391
means not to give Me anything,

00:10:47.592 --> 00:10:52.732
but to get rid of your ego and your stuck
up ideas which there have been –

00:10:52.933 --> 00:10:56.510
it would be a very good thing.

00:10:57.037 --> 00:11:01.120
When you discuss also among yourselves,
nobody should discuss inconveniences.

00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:05.289
I had told you that in a village it’s
a very difficult thing [indistinct words].

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.645
You don’t have to go to Himalayas,

00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:09.391
but travelling through India is not
an easy thing.

00:11:09.592 --> 00:11:13.162
And I had told all of you, I live with much
more conveniences

00:11:13.363 --> 00:11:19.089
and comforts than anyone of you live.
But I can adjust Myself much more,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.537
so you should also try to forget about it.

00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:25.978
Don’t talk of your inconveniences. That
will make you very gross.

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:33.521
The one who becomes subtler and subtler
can only achieve something.

00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:59.139
Today is another day, is called Bhishma
Ashtami,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.760
is the day when Bhishma, who was a great
saint

00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:10.790
who took a great vow and that vow he
carried out all his life.

00:17:10.991 --> 00:17:15.400
It was a great vow he took. So today
also is the day of a vow.

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:18.695
He took on an Ashtami day. On the Ashtami
day he took a vow,

00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:23.327
so today is another day for you to take
a vow.

00:17:23.528 --> 00:17:27.366
So also you should try to take a vow

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:30.644
and with that vow, you should be able

00:17:30.845 --> 00:17:35.188
to achieve something which has not been
yet achieved.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.084
This achievement is not only for this
place,

00:17:46.272 --> 00:17:53.473
is not only for Maharashtra, it is not only
for India,

00:17:53.674 --> 00:17:58.756
it is not only for the whole world, but for
the whole Universe.

00:17:58.957 --> 00:18:04.909
So you are playing a very important,
vital role

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:11.072
and one should try to improve one’s
quality of life,

00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:13.574
quality of personality.

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:19.433
Unless and until you have that substantial
quality, nothing is going to work out.

00:18:19.634 --> 00:18:24.010
This is what I am telling them: that you
must work out

00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:29.105
in such a way that you become substantially
dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:29.306 --> 00:18:33.496
Not just for your sake, not just for your
family

00:18:33.657 --> 00:18:36.480
or for your country, but for the whole
Universe.

00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:48.376
So you are the seeds who are going
to create that great atmosphere

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:59.924
that will bring forth the great change that
we are expecting of Mahayoga.

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:07.792
It is very important to understand that
so many people have talked about this,

00:19:07.993 --> 00:19:11.581
and I have come across a book which was
written 2000 years back

00:19:11.782 --> 00:19:15.534
which describes about this Mahayoga,

00:19:15.735 --> 00:19:17.987
and what is going to happen. It is very
interesting.

00:19:18.188 --> 00:19:21.999
After the puja and havan, I think
Mr. Chauhan will translate it to you

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:28.148
and you can understand what it is about.
So let us start now.
