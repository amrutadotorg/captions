WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.960
It is the first time I come to a Sahaja Yoga seminar, because every time we are different,

00:28.960 --> 00:41.240
the moment is new, the challenge is growing, and we need to move on.

00:41.240 --> 00:50.440
So I have nothing prepared for today.

00:50.440 --> 00:59.000
I just would like to say that when Shri Mataji starts her program, she says,

00:59.000 --> 01:07.960
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:07.960 --> 01:23.960
I suppose that I put this in connection with the line from Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings.

01:23.960 --> 01:30.360
Did you hear about the Lord of the Rings?

01:30.360 --> 01:36.360
You see, at some point when everything goes wrong in Middle-earth,

01:36.360 --> 01:45.080
and the power of Mordor and the power of Isengard is too much even for the high elves,

01:45.080 --> 01:57.080
then Mitrandir Gandalf says that help is still to come from ones that we don't expect.

01:57.080 --> 02:04.200
And that help was from the humblest of all the creatures of Middle-earth,

02:04.200 --> 02:19.160
not the warriors, not the wizards, not the elves, the first born, but these little halflings.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.680
So I always have the feeling that someone here in this room,

02:24.680 --> 02:34.280
there is someone who is sitting here, and who is the ring bearer.

02:34.280 --> 02:45.080
There is someone who is sitting here who will escape the temptations which made the higher one fall.

02:45.080 --> 02:54.280
There is someone sitting here who is the seeker of truth and who will carry the transformation

02:54.280 --> 03:02.600
to its appointed hand. And to this seeker, this girl or this boy who is sitting here,

03:02.600 --> 03:09.640
I like to bow.

03:09.640 --> 03:18.200
I like to bow because we need help.

03:18.200 --> 03:24.280
It's quite a battle out there.

03:24.280 --> 03:33.240
It has been very interesting, it has been very challenging, but it hasn't been easy.

03:33.240 --> 03:42.680
Now, it wasn't meant to be easy. And in all the prophetic books,

03:42.680 --> 03:48.920
it was always stated that that would be a difficult time.

03:48.920 --> 03:53.240
Does anyone here have the Bhagavad Gita by any chance?

03:53.240 --> 04:05.000
Those of you who meet and meditate for peace at the same time and the same hour,

04:05.080 --> 04:13.320
do you remember how the Bhagavad Gita started?

04:13.320 --> 04:23.880
Arjuna was seeing in the army of the Kaurava, his friends, his respected and beloved guru,

04:23.880 --> 04:28.760
his cousins. And he sat and he said,

04:28.760 --> 04:33.160
Vishnu, I shall not fight. This is my key to the king. Why should I fight?

04:33.160 --> 04:37.960
Just to gain the kingdom is not worth it. I'd rather die.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.560
And then started the Bhagavad Gita.

04:41.560 --> 04:48.920
In essence, this is a puppet show.

04:48.920 --> 04:57.800
And all in the puppet show, Mr. Saddam, Mr. Bush,

04:57.800 --> 05:03.160
Mr. TrÃ©goire, everyone.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.240
Everybody in this puppet show has some sort of role to play.

05:09.240 --> 05:13.560
With a little luck, they can have a sense for the role. Mostly they don't.

05:13.560 --> 05:21.160
But when there is the time for war, are you going to pray for peace?

05:21.160 --> 05:28.280
Are you at the beginning of the Mahabharata, sit down with Arjuna and say peace?

05:28.280 --> 05:32.840
Are you going to ask Mother for peace?

05:32.840 --> 05:38.280
I prefer peace to war. War is a doom. War is a curse.

05:38.280 --> 05:44.600
War creates boots. Boots generate evil, suffering.

05:44.600 --> 05:49.960
Nobody wishes war. But you are yogis.

05:49.960 --> 05:57.560
So what it is that we pray for as yogis?

05:57.560 --> 06:07.400
Did you get the point? I'm sorry because many people may not know English.

06:07.400 --> 06:13.080
Okay, what we need to pray if we are yogis for?

06:13.080 --> 06:21.720
What we need to pray for is not for war.

06:21.720 --> 06:25.480
Certainly not. Not for peace either.

06:25.480 --> 06:31.480
But for something which is called thy will be done.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.520
It's not the same thing.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.080
And first of all, thy will be done with me.

06:39.080 --> 06:46.520
With each of us. Because the path of growth to Sahaja Yoga is not to achieve something.

06:46.520 --> 06:52.200
It's not to concentrate on something. It's not to bend our little energies

06:52.200 --> 06:58.600
trying to move two lines ahead the cosmic plot.

06:58.600 --> 07:07.160
Our role as yogis is to discover the art of letting the power flow.

07:07.160 --> 07:12.680
Not by straining. Sorry? Oh, okay.

07:12.680 --> 07:19.960
Not by straining. Not by concentrating. By being.

07:19.960 --> 07:29.560
If we are what our mother empowers us to become, then it flows through us.

07:29.560 --> 07:36.440
And then the big advantage compared to concentrating and praying and having projects

07:36.440 --> 07:41.800
is that it does not give us ego.

07:41.800 --> 07:46.200
Because we can be yogis and we carry our ego. Do you know Ravana?

07:46.200 --> 07:54.680
Did you hear about Ravana? Right? Ravana? Anyone? Friend of yours?

07:54.680 --> 08:02.520
Well, for your information, Ravana was a realized soul.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.840
Was a realized soul with some powers because he could even shake Kailash.

08:06.840 --> 08:10.520
Which you can't.

08:10.520 --> 08:19.240
And yet he was Ravana. Why? Because it is possible to walk on the spiritual path

08:19.240 --> 08:24.600
carrying the ego which becomes subtler and subtler and subtler.

08:24.600 --> 08:30.120
And the ego is, I am a Sahaja Yogi and I'm spreading Mother's Kingdom

08:30.200 --> 08:34.280
and I'm doing this and I'm doing that.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.760
There is one mantra which is, I am my own guru.

08:38.760 --> 08:46.120
But some people can put a postscript and write, I am my own fake guru.

08:46.120 --> 08:51.880
It's possible. It's already seen.

08:51.880 --> 08:59.880
It's already practiced. Now for those of us who have this temptation,

09:00.680 --> 09:03.880
we should help such people.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.720
By remembering one thing.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.120
You know,

09:14.120 --> 09:20.120
Ashaduallahu illaaha illa Allah, Ashaduallahu muhmadadah as-Sulluallahu ala.

09:20.120 --> 09:24.280
There is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet.

09:24.280 --> 09:28.840
There is only one deity and there is only one good for us.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.120
And that one is our mother.

09:33.080 --> 09:38.280
So everything which brings us there is helpful.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.000
So is the staircase leading there?

09:41.000 --> 09:44.840
Or is the staircase getting you glued to a step?

09:44.840 --> 09:48.120
Attached to somebody.

09:48.120 --> 09:58.120
Now back to war and peace. It's a nice subject, isn't it?

09:58.120 --> 10:02.120
Nobody has the Bhagavad Gita here, no?

10:02.120 --> 10:08.120
Okay, so do you want to know why there is a war?

10:10.120 --> 10:16.120
Or do you want to know why there might be an apocalypse?

10:16.120 --> 10:26.120
If you do, buy the Bhagavad Gita. I would have spared you the expense if you would have it here.

10:26.120 --> 10:36.120
And read the verse 9-11 of the Bhagavad Gita.

10:36.120 --> 10:42.120
All right? All clear?

10:42.120 --> 10:48.120
9-11, you know what 9-11 is?

10:48.120 --> 10:58.120
Now, if someone has the Gita here, I'll read it for you. If there is no Gita here, you'll have to back home and read it.

10:58.120 --> 11:04.120
That leads to the next point.

11:04.120 --> 11:08.120
You'll see. It's interesting.

11:12.120 --> 11:22.120
The next point is that I don't know anybody who understands Sahaja Yoga.

11:22.120 --> 11:30.120
I don't know anybody who understands who Sri Mataji is.

11:30.120 --> 11:36.120
I don't claim to understand either of them.

11:36.120 --> 11:40.120
I don't claim to understand Sahaja Yoga nor to understand Sri Mataji.

11:41.120 --> 11:49.120
But I see much more clearly now than 30 years ago when I came inside Sahaja Yoga.

11:49.120 --> 11:59.120
And from that clarity, I can only ask you to hang on.

11:59.120 --> 12:12.120
Because you are part, we are part of something which is going to change the face of history.

12:12.120 --> 12:26.120
And even though people would like to put us in a mental hospital for stating it, the truth is that it is so.

12:26.120 --> 12:31.120
Sahaja Yoga is growing.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.120
It doesn't depend on you. It doesn't depend on me.

12:35.120 --> 12:41.120
Any one of you can step out at any time. No one is indispensable. But it is growing.

12:41.120 --> 12:49.120
It is maybe not growing in the area where you live. It is growing in so many different ways.

12:49.120 --> 12:58.120
And again I bow to that unknown boy or girl. I bow to those who will carry this.

12:58.120 --> 13:17.120
Because all of us have a role to play and many of you have still to play yours.

13:17.120 --> 13:29.120
Herbert Heininger, good friend, remember an old seminar we had in Austria a long time back.

13:29.120 --> 13:34.120
I tend to be a bit sentimental when I am among Austrians.

13:34.120 --> 13:42.120
And what we said in those days, yeah because Austrians are nice guys.

13:42.120 --> 13:49.120
Despite the White Mountain and Wallenstein and all this stuff, this is over now.

13:49.120 --> 13:54.120
They are nicer now. They are no longer Catholics.

13:54.120 --> 14:00.120
And one thing that we said then was there are two realities.

14:00.120 --> 14:05.120
There is she and there is we.

14:05.120 --> 14:11.120
And we are the vahana of she.

14:11.120 --> 14:17.120
The extraordinary dimension of Sahaja Yoga is not to get self-realization.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.120
Because other gurus did that before.

14:20.120 --> 14:24.120
Extraordinary dimension of Sahaja Yoga is collective consciousness.

14:24.120 --> 14:33.120
This is why negativity always tries to attack the making of our collective consciousness.

14:33.120 --> 14:38.120
It is going to try to disturb the relationship of friendship between yogis.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.120
For many little reasons.

14:40.120 --> 14:45.120
Going from Moladara up to Sahaja.

14:45.120 --> 14:50.120
It is going to try to prevent people to go in, I shall say.

14:50.120 --> 14:58.120
It is going to try to create jealousies, conflict with the leaders, little groups here, little groups there.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.120
Why?

14:59.120 --> 15:12.120
Because the one thing that the devil fears is the making of the horse.

15:12.120 --> 15:22.120
The white horse of the last rider is the collective consciousness of the realized souls.

15:22.120 --> 15:30.120
If I were the devil I would also do the same. He is a very rational chap.

15:30.120 --> 15:43.120
Now when we are moving towards unity, it helps to understand that none of us can put out much light by ourselves.

15:43.120 --> 15:47.120
It is like the little candle that was just blown away here.

15:47.120 --> 15:53.120
One candle only needs so much, especially in a hall like that.

15:53.120 --> 16:00.120
But if there are hundred candles, you can see where your light and my light ends or starts.

16:00.120 --> 16:09.120
But the total light is simply more effective.

16:09.120 --> 16:22.120
So I think that Shri Mataji did say many times that I am happy or I enjoy when you love each other.

16:22.120 --> 16:28.120
She wrote me once, she wrote me once, she said,

16:28.120 --> 16:34.120
I know you love me very much, but in this way everybody loves me.

16:34.120 --> 16:40.120
They build cathedrals for me. They build mosque for me.

16:40.120 --> 16:49.120
To love Shri Mataji once we start getting an idea of what is going on is not difficult.

16:49.120 --> 16:58.120
So I think where she really relishes is when we start loving each other.

16:58.120 --> 17:01.120
Sometimes difficult, isn't it?

17:01.120 --> 17:07.120
Sahaja Yogi can be such stupid blokes sometimes, don't you think? No?

17:07.120 --> 17:12.120
We need to have protocol of the yogis.

17:12.120 --> 17:18.120
We need to see our strength and forget our weaknesses.

17:18.120 --> 17:28.120
Like mother, when I came to her there was a big, big, big lump of mud and a diamond, she said,

17:28.120 --> 17:34.120
I wouldn't have a clue of course, but a diamond under the mud. I wouldn't see that.

17:34.120 --> 17:38.120
Well, what she did, she chose to look at the diamond and not at the mud.

17:38.120 --> 17:42.120
And I think that was very helpful for me.

17:42.120 --> 17:47.120
That she could have legitimately looked at the mud because it was there too.

17:47.120 --> 17:54.120
So the problem is not to see reality, the problem is to create reality.

17:54.120 --> 18:02.120
To have the vision of that reality that we want to make happen.

18:03.120 --> 18:13.120
And that we can start by understanding how the we is important.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.120
The we is the only protection against the little I.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.120
The big I is the self, so the big I is the right.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.120
The little I is the ego and the ego is a clever chap.

18:22.120 --> 18:27.120
You think that you push him through the door and it comes back from the window.

18:27.120 --> 18:31.120
No, not easy.

18:31.120 --> 18:40.120
When we are together, we are completely protected from that.

18:40.120 --> 18:47.120
So I was requested to speak briefly. I think I will stop here.

18:50.120 --> 18:57.120
I think the idea of the organizers, a privilege that I don't share, I'm here just to guest,

18:57.120 --> 19:07.120
is to ask you to ask any question whatsoever which is not completely foolish.

19:07.120 --> 19:15.120
And in any language that you want because people can translate.

19:15.120 --> 19:25.120
And then some friends here sitting on a bench or some of you or whatever would choose to answer.

19:26.120 --> 19:31.120
Is this alright? Should we go that way?

19:34.120 --> 19:37.120
So you see even in the United Nations one might respect time.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.120
Thank you very much.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.120
Get up. Get up please.

20:01.120 --> 20:07.120
I remember just now that Gregor has said,

20:07.120 --> 20:19.120
someone here in the room, some boy or girl has the ring and that we need help.

20:19.120 --> 20:29.120
So I think if you come forward with questions, it will help. Thank you.

20:29.120 --> 20:52.120
And if I may add, we all know it's not easy because also I'm sitting here and the pulse is a little faster than normal.

20:52.120 --> 21:02.120
And everyone who has a question in his heart and probably considers to come forward, all to the pulse is rising up.

21:02.120 --> 21:11.120
But I can tell you how the pulse rate is if you come here.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.120
Come here.

21:41.120 --> 21:50.120
I have a question that came up very often the last few months actually while we had public programs, doing programs.

21:50.120 --> 21:58.120
And I realized one of the last weeks that the way we explain raising Kundalini to new people is different.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.120
So that's one of my questions.

22:00.120 --> 22:14.120
It's exactly the way a lot of us are used to is to raise the Kundalini to a knot and then the second time do two knots.

22:14.120 --> 22:20.120
It's just a tiny little question but in fact it's explained differently.

22:20.120 --> 22:24.120
So I wondered what you're doing.

22:45.120 --> 22:50.120
The pulse rate. I checked the pulse rate.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.120
There is nothing.

22:58.120 --> 23:07.120
If I could remember, there is one video which Mataji, where she is showing it.

23:07.120 --> 23:12.120
I remember it well, where you see it clearly shown.

23:12.120 --> 23:20.120
Always do it not thinking of left channel, right channel, whatever might be also thought about.

23:20.120 --> 23:24.120
And just to do it, try it.

23:24.120 --> 23:31.120
What I remember it was first time one knot, second time two knots, third time three knots.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.120
And then the burn down.

23:34.120 --> 23:39.120
This is what I remember. If somebody remembers different, please.

23:39.120 --> 23:45.120
Maybe there is something to add.

23:45.120 --> 23:48.120
I think the process is really two processes.

23:48.120 --> 23:53.120
One is raising the Kundalini and the other one is tying it up.

23:53.120 --> 24:01.120
I have very often had the privilege of witnessing Shri Mataji working on people,

24:01.120 --> 24:05.120
on new people or old people or sick people or whatsoever.

24:05.120 --> 24:10.120
And in the end she would always say to us, now tie him up.

24:10.120 --> 24:17.120
Alright, so it is really the one thing is rising the Kundalini

24:17.120 --> 24:23.120
and the other thing is tying the Kundalini up in the sense of connecting the individual to the Divine

24:23.120 --> 24:29.120
and establishing that connection which is done by the three knots.

24:29.120 --> 24:37.120
And one should be very, very clear about the fact that this is not a symbolic thing.

24:37.120 --> 24:41.120
We are not doing this as a symbolic process,

24:41.120 --> 24:45.120
nor are we doing the knots as a symbol,

24:45.120 --> 24:52.120
which many people sometimes like to say to new people because they themselves feel a bit strange about it.

24:52.120 --> 24:59.120
But no, in fact, it is an actual process which is done and we cannot see what we are doing,

24:59.120 --> 25:03.120
but we can feel what's happening when we have done it.

25:03.120 --> 25:10.120
So it is very important to remember it is an actual process

25:10.120 --> 25:15.120
which has an actual meaning, it has an actual effect

25:15.120 --> 25:20.120
and it is divided in two things which is rising the Kundalini and tying it up.

25:20.120 --> 25:24.120
Thank you. Doesn't that answer the question?

25:24.120 --> 25:27.120
May I ask a question?

25:27.120 --> 25:29.120
There is a question.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.120
Good job.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.120
Okay.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.120
There is also one question.

25:35.120 --> 25:40.120
When we give realization, many people ask,

25:40.120 --> 25:46.120
what do you think about the USA and Iraq, about the war which is going to come?

25:46.120 --> 25:50.120
And actually, we don't really know.

25:50.120 --> 25:55.120
Shri Mataji says that Bush is a nice person, but is he nice because he is really nice

25:55.120 --> 26:02.120
or is it just nice because he is going to expose all the wrong things going on?

26:02.120 --> 26:09.120
So what about you say in Iraq about the war?

26:09.120 --> 26:13.120
Take that one. That's yours.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.120
Five minutes.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.120
Five minutes?

26:17.120 --> 26:21.120
Three minutes.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.120
You all have been generous.

26:23.120 --> 26:33.120
I would like to suggest this.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.120
Well, I'll go back to a little anecdote.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.120
I visited Shri Mataji during the Gulf War.

26:38.120 --> 26:42.120
During the Gulf War, she told me I am protecting the American army.

26:42.120 --> 26:47.120
Two hours later, I was in the plane leaving Delhi and I opened the Newsweek

26:47.120 --> 26:55.120
and I read an article where a corporal who was on a Humvee vehicle with three other Marines

26:55.120 --> 26:58.120
got hit by a mortar.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.120
The vehicle got hit by a mortar from the Iraqis.

27:01.120 --> 27:08.120
So the ship or the Humvee went 20 meters in the air and was completely destroyed.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.120
All the four people were alive and in the Newsweek it was written,

27:12.120 --> 27:15.120
the corporal was saying that was nothing short of a complete miracle.

27:15.120 --> 27:19.120
I read this two hours after mother told me I protect the American army.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.120
So this is the first war.

27:21.120 --> 27:29.120
Now, I did ask Shri Mataji about Bush because I felt that the policies of Bush were about everything

27:29.120 --> 27:37.120
that I found abominable in the beginning with the Kyoto Protocol, with the Civil Court of Justice,

27:37.120 --> 27:39.120
so many aspects of his policy.

27:39.120 --> 27:50.120
But Shri Mataji did confirm very clearly that she sees qualities of Bush

27:50.120 --> 27:56.120
and what I understand is that Bush is not like many European intellectuals,

27:56.120 --> 27:58.120
a constructed personality.

27:58.120 --> 28:03.120
He is very spontaneous and in a sense he is very innocent.

28:03.120 --> 28:08.120
It is very difficult for Western intellectuals to go along with a type like that

28:08.120 --> 28:15.120
because he is in black and white and good and evil and intellectual like to discuss grey shades.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.120
He is not at all like that.

28:17.120 --> 28:23.120
So I think that it is true that Shri Mataji does support his action

28:23.120 --> 28:30.120
and that she was very clearly saying that she can work through him.

28:30.120 --> 28:35.120
Now when Shri Mataji said that she can work through him, no one understand what she means,

28:35.120 --> 28:39.120
neither I, again, because we don't know what the purpose is.

28:39.120 --> 28:46.120
As far as Saddam Hussein is concerned, I think that was quite clear from the first Gulf War

28:46.120 --> 28:48.120
that he is a rakshasa.

28:48.120 --> 28:55.120
So that's what I can say.

28:55.120 --> 28:59.120
I don't ask you to vote left or to vote right.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.120
I don't ask you to vote for Bush.

29:01.120 --> 29:06.120
I am just saying there is a game out there which is beyond us and as Sahaja Yogi,

29:06.120 --> 29:10.120
we can sort of watch and see what's happening.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.120
I think it is completely out of our hands.

29:12.120 --> 29:14.120
Anyways, what else to do?

29:14.120 --> 29:22.120
Eat popcorn in the movie hall. That's it.

29:22.120 --> 29:26.120
What do you say to new people has nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga?

29:26.120 --> 29:30.120
Politics is one thing, Sahaja Yoga is completely different.

29:30.120 --> 29:34.120
If people don't like Bush, it's fine.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.120
If you don't like Bush, don't like Bush.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.120
You don't need to like him because you are a yogi.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.120
I didn't like his environmental policies at all.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.120
It has nothing to do with Sahaja.

29:45.120 --> 29:51.120
If you ask me what mother said about Bush, I try to give you a feedback because I talk directly about it.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.120
So this is not his say.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.120
It's something that I know.

29:56.120 --> 30:00.120
I had this discussion already when he was competing with Al Gore.

30:00.120 --> 30:05.120
In my view, Al Gore, the democratic challenger, had much better policies.

30:05.120 --> 30:09.120
Al Gore is an extremely mental person and when people are very cerebral,

30:09.120 --> 30:13.120
the inspiration from their unconscious don't come.

30:13.120 --> 30:17.120
I'm not saying that mother is a mother.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.120
She doesn't like war at all.

30:19.120 --> 30:27.120
Maybe she sees that there are 300 vectors with microbiological dirty bombs stored somewhere.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.120
What do I know?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.120
What do I know?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.120
So everybody says the war is a horrible thing.

30:32.120 --> 30:37.120
Maybe if there is no war and you have a dirty bomb exploding in Vienna,

30:37.120 --> 30:42.120
then you will say, my God, we should have got rid of this guy two years ago.

30:42.120 --> 30:45.120
Who knows? Not me.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.120
I'm not sure.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.120
I'm not sure.

31:02.120 --> 31:06.120
The war is a horrible thing.

31:06.120 --> 31:09.120
I don't know how to describe it.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.120
I don't know how to describe it.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.120
I don't know how to describe it.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.120
I don't know how to describe it.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.120
I don't know how to describe it.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.120
I don't know how to describe it.

31:47.120 --> 31:51.120
Everyone of us who is here with his wife should invite his wife to join.

31:51.120 --> 31:59.120
So please, Katri, Sabina, Barbara, Sabina, what's your wife name?

31:59.120 --> 32:01.120
What's your name?

32:01.120 --> 32:02.120
Vakti.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.120
Vakti. Come forward.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.120
Now you see our wives are fine.

32:18.120 --> 32:23.120
So please those of you who are big feminist, invite our wives to come forward.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.120
Thank you very much.

32:28.120 --> 32:33.120
I know someone whose pulse rate is going very high now.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.120
Let's sit on the bench and sit on the floor.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.120
Say hi.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.120
Thank you.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.120
Philippe made the proposal because his wife is not here.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.120
There are leaders in Sahaj who are women.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.120
You know about that, right?

33:12.120 --> 33:14.120
They're just not in this region.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.120
Next question.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.120
Thank you.

33:26.120 --> 33:29.120
Someone ask Panchay Leno, okay?

33:29.120 --> 33:31.120
She's coming.

33:45.120 --> 33:54.120
I'd like to ask the ladies in the panel what is their vision for the Lakshmi of Sahaja Yoga?

33:54.120 --> 33:58.120
The vision for the Lakshmi of Sahaja Yoga?

33:59.120 --> 34:01.120
It's a question for the ladies.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.120
Yes, yes.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.120
Jackie.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.120
Okay, you have to say which one.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.120
Which one?

34:09.120 --> 34:11.120
I'll try to answer.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.120
It's good to hear.

34:20.120 --> 34:23.120
I don't know the last speaker.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.120
Okay.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.120
That's what I should do.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.120
Talking about the silent problem here.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.120
Next to it.

34:50.120 --> 34:54.120
The vision depends where you look at.

34:54.120 --> 35:02.120
There are so many facets on that aspect of being a yogini.

35:02.120 --> 35:07.120
You don't need to be a Shakti or a Lakshmi.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.120
Any one of us.

35:09.120 --> 35:22.120
I think one aspect maybe we can address here as we live in a western country

35:23.120 --> 35:40.120
where the latest hundred years in the social evolution of our society have destroyed many old patterns

35:40.120 --> 35:52.120
which had come from different experiences over generations have been torn away.

35:52.120 --> 36:03.120
Some out of conditioning which were hampering the balance and were rightly discarded.

36:03.120 --> 36:15.120
But in the process of discarding them we threw away everything which was still valuable

36:15.120 --> 36:26.120
within this traditional way of building a society which starts in the family.

36:26.120 --> 36:41.120
And for yogis, as well men, as women, the understanding in its core has to come back to

36:41.120 --> 36:51.120
very basic, natural, simple understanding of who stands where and stands where.

36:51.120 --> 37:02.120
It doesn't mean what we do outwardly but it means we have to understand inwardly inside of ourselves

37:02.120 --> 37:10.120
to find satisfaction in our role.

37:10.120 --> 37:22.120
We understand to delimitate ourselves where we don't trespass anymore on the side, off the right or off the left side.

37:22.120 --> 37:34.120
Women are more on the left side and there we shall evolve, stand and act.

37:34.120 --> 37:46.120
And if we are capable of filling the space on the left side, men will not have to go too much on the right side

37:46.120 --> 37:50.120
or try to come into the left side to compensate.

37:50.120 --> 37:58.120
If we don't go on the right side, we stay on the left side. We have our space. Men have their space on their side.

37:58.120 --> 38:13.120
And it's an extremely vast subject which would take maybe days and hours to discuss whereby discussion is not going to bring any means.

38:13.120 --> 38:25.120
Nowadays what we have to do is to rediscover in our becoming of a yogi, of a yogini,

38:25.120 --> 38:34.120
our qualities which are innate, which are given to us through the fact that we are born either a woman or a man.

38:34.120 --> 38:42.120
If we are a mother, we have certain qualities. If we are a young woman, we have other qualities.

38:42.120 --> 38:52.120
And through the age, we mature to get again other qualities once we have fulfilled our motherly duties.

38:52.120 --> 38:58.120
And each one of us is at a different level in a different situation.

38:58.120 --> 39:09.120
There cannot be one saying which is going to solve everybody's problem or give everybody the one way.

39:09.120 --> 39:20.120
We all have our ways in our circle, in our family, in our society where we are to experience.

39:20.120 --> 39:32.120
And this is again meditation and shimadashi told us enough on all the subject to integrate and this how.

39:50.120 --> 40:15.120
Maybe also something can be added from the perspective of a man.

40:16.120 --> 40:24.120
Because I think that women sometimes underestimate their importance in Sahaja Yoga.

40:24.120 --> 40:33.120
And this may be due to two factors. Either they are not sufficiently respected and recognized by their husbands or brothers,

40:33.120 --> 40:37.120
or they have not sufficient self-respect themselves.

40:37.120 --> 40:45.120
But whatever it is, the building of Sahaja Yoga is entirely depending on the women.

40:45.120 --> 40:54.120
The building of any social activity within Sahaja Yoga is entirely depending on women.

40:54.120 --> 41:06.120
The building of the family, the building of a natural, the building of a local collectivity and of the national and global collectivity will entirely depend on the women.

41:06.120 --> 41:14.120
That we have really experienced over the past twenty years and we have heard mothers saying that plenty of times.

41:14.120 --> 41:26.120
And I think it is high time that the women become much more self-confident, that they are much more respected by their husbands and by their brothers,

41:26.120 --> 41:34.120
and that they fully understand their importance as the sustainers of Dharma in Sahaja Yoga.

41:34.120 --> 41:41.120
And they should be extremely clear cut, they should be extremely discriminative,

41:41.120 --> 41:58.120
and they should be very, very enlightened about the power of chastity, the power of innocence, and the power of defending the family and the individual and the collective Dharma.

41:58.120 --> 42:04.120
Because that is under the guardianship of the women in Sahaja Yoga.

42:04.120 --> 42:13.120
So I think the role of the women in Sahaja Yoga cannot be overestimated.

42:13.120 --> 42:18.120
It is absolutely of vital importance. Thank you very much.

42:18.120 --> 42:29.120
I just wanted to say one sentence, also as an answer or something.

42:29.120 --> 42:34.120
A sentence which Shri Mataji said and which I'll never forget in my life.

42:34.120 --> 42:49.120
It was that Shri Mataji said, the women should be like the mother earth and the men are the flowers which are growing on this earth.

42:49.120 --> 42:55.120
And the better are the women, the more beautiful are the men.

43:05.120 --> 43:12.120
We have a game to this little philosophical and sophisticated thing which was said before.

43:12.120 --> 43:20.120
The women are also presenting the power of love and Sahaja Yoga without love is dead.

43:20.120 --> 43:33.120
We have one question. Maybe I have not so many information, but this question.

43:33.120 --> 43:44.120
I don't know, we were talking about Islamic countries and something like this.

43:45.120 --> 44:01.120
The question is, if you know the way to spread yoga to these countries.

44:01.120 --> 44:05.120
I've read something, but how it works?

44:05.120 --> 44:12.120
I've read something that yogis from Italy were in Yemen or where?

44:12.120 --> 44:21.120
And just to say about these countries, where it works and how it can go there?

44:35.120 --> 44:52.120
I want to speak about it. I have myself a question about this.

44:52.120 --> 45:01.120
I want to ask you all about your success.

45:01.120 --> 45:09.120
In Islamic countries, everybody knows that Muslims believe only one God.

45:09.120 --> 45:17.120
And this God must be a man. That is their belief. I can't change it. That is so easy.

45:17.120 --> 45:29.120
If you are doing the program in Arabic countries or in Iran, or we are doing a program in Vienna for Muslim people,

45:29.120 --> 45:39.120
we have had difficulty to present our mother. And we can't hide her.

45:39.120 --> 45:47.120
I am Sahaja Yoga, I am standing between two mountains and I don't know which way I have to tell.

45:47.120 --> 45:55.120
If I tell she matters is the God and I have maybe 70 people, the next day it will remain only 5.

45:55.120 --> 46:02.120
If I tell she is not or somebody is standing there, I have difficulty.

46:02.120 --> 46:09.120
Here is the seminar, we have 600 people here. I would like to hear your suggestion.

46:09.120 --> 46:21.120
How we deal with the Muslim people and everybody, every brother and sister has somehow some experiment with the Muslim people.

46:21.120 --> 46:30.120
I would like to hear your suggestion and afterwards I will tell the answer to this, the yogi what he has done.

46:30.120 --> 46:51.120
You know, I want to talk about mother in a more general way. I think that we should not go around trying to say who Sri Mataji is up front.

46:51.120 --> 47:01.120
Because I do not think anybody can accept that like this. I was once in Florida and Sri Mataji sent me ahead for a public program.

47:01.120 --> 47:14.120
And he said, Priguard, tell them who I am. Alright? I made my introduction, then Sri Mataji came and everybody was petrified.

47:15.120 --> 47:23.120
So mother tried to make them laugh, she made jokes, she was humorous, but they were petrified.

47:23.120 --> 47:29.120
So when we drove back in the car, she said, Priguard, what did you do to them?

47:29.120 --> 47:34.120
I said, mother, I told them who you are.

47:34.120 --> 47:46.120
So, you know, I would not have accepted, I would not have accepted someone telling me who is Sri Mataji. I would not.

47:46.120 --> 47:56.120
The only reason I messaged a yogi is because I felt it. It's based on experience, not on faith. Faith comes after experience.

47:56.120 --> 48:05.120
So my answer to you, my dear old brother, is that we should find ways for them to feel the vibrations.

48:05.120 --> 48:15.120
We should find ways without hurting them to tell them this is a vibration in the Kaaba, Kaaba is emitting energy, that energy comes from various things.

48:15.120 --> 48:19.120
That picture also has energy, the stars have energy, put your hands, whatever.

48:20.120 --> 48:28.120
When they feel something, then they have a chance to hook. Some of them feel and then they still refuse.

48:28.120 --> 48:35.120
But if we go ahead, because we want to be courageous, and we go ahead saying, mother is a Vishakhi, it doesn't mean a thing to them.

48:36.120 --> 48:51.120
You know, the proof, you know, Deng Xiaoping said it doesn't matter whether the cat is black or grey as long as he catches a mouse.

48:51.120 --> 49:01.120
And with this, China is becoming the greatest power on this planet, overtaking Europe in GNP, Europe and USA by the year 2020.

49:01.120 --> 49:10.120
So, and this is Confucius, and this is Dharma also. Dharma is very practical. So we have to follow what works.

49:10.120 --> 49:15.120
And what works is what brings people to matter. Okay? So be pragmatic about that.

49:19.120 --> 49:28.120
And we had Sahaja Yoga in Tunisia, we had Sahaja Yoga in Morocco, we have Sahaja Yoga in a number of African countries.

49:29.120 --> 49:38.120
All these people are very sweet. I mean, I have travelled in over 35 African countries, I have gone to most of the Middle East countries.

49:38.120 --> 49:49.120
These people are very sweet, but they are captured by a dogma. And despite all our weakness in the West, despite our broken down molladera,

49:49.120 --> 49:55.120
at least our system has disadvantage that we could organize programs of Sahaja Yoga in our cities.

49:56.120 --> 50:07.120
So freedom is a very big blessing. And the problem is that these people could get to Sahaja very easily, but they are very conditioned.

50:07.120 --> 50:14.120
And just now the main country that we have is Turkey in Sahaja Yoga. We also have, of course, Sahaja Yogis in Iran.

50:14.120 --> 50:21.120
But there are 700 million Muslims on the planet and it's important that they get their realization.

50:21.120 --> 50:24.120
In India there are a number of Muslims who got their realization.

50:24.120 --> 50:50.120
We are since the year 1995 in Morocco with some people.

50:50.120 --> 51:00.120
And I really put a lot of my attention as a Sahaja Yogi to this program with the Muslim world.

51:00.120 --> 51:08.120
And it took us years and we met many people there. We gave realization to quite some hundreds of people.

51:08.120 --> 51:16.120
But really we found this was not easy for them to recognize Shri Mataji and to accept the way we meditate.

51:17.120 --> 51:34.120
And you know, we were talking about the aspect of the women. And I think this understanding of the women in Sahaja Yoga could be one of the answers for the Muslim world.

51:35.120 --> 51:41.120
In the oldest 8 years we were Muslim men who went to these places.

51:41.120 --> 51:50.120
And just one year ago Selma from the Netherlands, she went there and the Sikh of truth she found there,

51:50.120 --> 51:55.120
he took Sahaja Yoga in such a way that he really became one of our brothers.

51:56.120 --> 51:59.120
And we didn't find this man there.

51:59.120 --> 52:08.120
And also we have this problem in this Muslim world that the feminine, the ladies are not respected and they are dominated.

52:08.120 --> 52:19.120
And so it is this aspect which is missing there, this aspect of the Shaktis which could help them somehow.

52:20.120 --> 52:30.120
And of course in this Muslim world you cannot bring Sahaja Yoga in a way that you talk without discretion.

52:30.120 --> 52:38.120
There if you make any program or you give realization to these people or even here in Europe, it is easy to make them friends.

52:38.120 --> 52:41.120
But you have to be what you talk.

52:41.120 --> 52:45.120
And it is not what you talk, it is what you be.

52:45.120 --> 52:48.120
And this is the love, you have to have it.

52:48.120 --> 52:53.120
And you have all what is ideal to be Sahaja Yogi, you have to live it.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.120
And this is to convince them.

52:55.120 --> 53:02.120
And they will come if we are there with the help of our sisters I am sure, it will grow.

53:12.120 --> 53:15.120
It is a dream.

53:15.120 --> 53:24.120
So I must say that to me, a dream is a very important thing.

53:24.120 --> 53:28.120
You have to respect.

53:28.120 --> 53:35.120
I know that I have been there for a long time and then I will say this to you.

54:36.120 --> 54:45.120
Our vision is to create a dream, a instrument that lives in the dream.

54:45.120 --> 54:51.120
That is why we are here, to understand what we are doing.

54:51.120 --> 54:56.120
And that is not the way you think, that has to be seen.

54:56.120 --> 54:59.120
We are not going to be able to do that.

55:00.120 --> 55:04.120
But I will come back to you when your meditation is over.

55:04.120 --> 55:08.120
And we will give you the hand, the hand of the hand,

55:08.120 --> 55:11.120
to give you an instrument that lives in the dream.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.120
It is a dream.

55:12.120 --> 55:13.120
Thank you.

55:29.120 --> 55:31.120
Sorry.

55:31.120 --> 55:33.120
No excuse.

55:33.120 --> 55:39.120
I mean, the name of the thing which she said is that we could just give a banner,

55:39.120 --> 55:44.120
that Shri Mataji makes us the pure instrument of her love.

55:44.120 --> 55:47.120
I think this was the reason.

55:47.120 --> 56:00.120
I don't know why I am talking now, it is very high.

56:00.120 --> 56:03.120
Maybe I say it in two minutes.

56:03.120 --> 56:07.120
I come from this area of the feminist.

56:07.120 --> 56:10.120
I was a very feminist when I was young.

56:10.120 --> 56:13.120
Because my father, he was very intriguing, my mother,

56:13.120 --> 56:16.120
she was a very good luxury, very good luxury.

56:16.120 --> 56:23.120
And I thought I have to be very intelligent and self confident, all these things.

56:23.120 --> 56:28.120
And in the beginning of our marriage, I am sure I was not nice to my husband.

56:28.120 --> 56:32.120
It was like not together, but he was and I was.

56:32.120 --> 56:41.120
When I came to such a yoga, I found out that I liked all these things that how my mother was.

56:41.120 --> 56:46.120
And how we are like human.

56:46.120 --> 56:53.120
And then I like to express the compassion.

56:53.120 --> 56:58.120
And it gives me a lot of sense of heart to express it.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.120
It is like a dilemma.

57:00.120 --> 57:09.120
You like to be a woman, and you like to express it, but maybe we can establish it somehow.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.120
Thank you.

57:42.120 --> 57:44.120
I am not that nice.

57:44.120 --> 57:46.120
Stereotype.

57:51.120 --> 57:55.120
We have one yogini, she comes from America.

57:55.120 --> 57:59.120
And she moved to Austria.

57:59.120 --> 58:02.120
And after some time she said to me,

58:02.120 --> 58:08.120
one thing I don't understand, why do the women not dare to speak up?

58:08.120 --> 58:13.120
Why don't they say anything? What is happening? What is wrong?

58:13.120 --> 58:18.120
It is always the men doing everything, the programs and organizing everything.

58:18.120 --> 58:26.120
And yes, this is a good question actually.

58:26.120 --> 58:33.120
I don't know the answer, but I try to meditate upon it.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.120
Because I have the same problem.

58:36.120 --> 58:42.120
I feel that I have a lot to give.

58:42.120 --> 58:48.120
And I have difficulties to express it in the collectivity.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.120
And somehow...

59:07.120 --> 59:15.120
One thing I found out in the last couple of years is that it has to do with...

59:15.120 --> 59:20.120
It has a lot to do with a Catholic Church.

59:20.120 --> 59:24.120
And the way women were treated.

59:24.120 --> 59:34.120
And the way women who had something to say and who had wisdom to say were treated.

59:35.120 --> 59:42.120
And I think this created a lot of fear.

59:42.120 --> 59:47.120
A fear to express ourselves.

59:50.120 --> 59:55.120
But the only thing we can do is to work on it.

59:55.120 --> 59:57.120
We have to work it out. That's the only thing.

59:57.120 --> 59:59.120
We have to go through it.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:04.120
We have to give ourselves a push.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.120
And we know I'm shaking when I'm talking.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.120
Just we have to try it.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.120
We have to show it with things.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:22.120
We have to show it fear and lack of self-confidence.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:33.120
And I think the things can only work out if we do it.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.120
If everybody tries to...

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:44.120
Because I know it's much easier to sit down and leave the stage to the man.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.120
It is easier somehow.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:51.120
But I think this is not what she wants from us.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:01:04.120
She wants us to give the message to...

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:14.120
She wants us to show the women in the West

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:24.120
how women can stand up and say something without being aggressive.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:30.120
Without saying, well, I have the same value as the man.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:36.120
We know all these right-sided women in politics and everywhere.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.120
This is not the way.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120
It's something else.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:51.120
It's a kind of smooth, motherly, loving way that we have to express ourselves.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.120
And in Sahaja Yoga I think it works very well.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.120
We have families and we try to bring about children in the Sahaja way

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:09.120
and try to tell them the values that we were not missing.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:22.120
This is what gives the man the balance.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:29.120
And this is how the man can develop their qualities in their way.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:38.120
And so I think... I never thought that I can speak so long.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:58.120
As I am married to Sabine, I have to completely agree that...

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.120
the power of women...

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:09.120
If I take myself, who is rather some person who tends to be on the right side?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.120
And I am a man.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.120
And as Shri Mataji said, there is a brake and an accelerator in the car.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.120
Without the accelerator, the car doesn't move.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.120
And without the brake, it cannot stop.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:32.120
And so it's the question, as Sabine mentioned, of the balance between those two parts.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:38.120
Which are meant to be. One, the brake, and the other one, the accelerator.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:49.120
And as a man, I have to say that I really appreciate that my wife has got this soothing power to cool down.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.120
And as we know that, especially in Austria, we had some time.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:04:02.120
When Shri Mataji said that the Austrian ladies have a tendency to take the role of the accelerator.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:12.120
Which creates an atmosphere which is too much on the right, which gets too hot.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:18.120
So I find it's very important that as a man, we support our wives.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.120
Which they fulfill the role of somebody who is soothing.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.120
Because the soothing power is silent.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.120
The soothing power doesn't show off so much.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.120
And that's why many times we don't see it.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:40.120
And if we can express also that we appreciate this soothing power which comes from our will.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:47.120
Then they might much less feel that they should do something else.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120
This was the one thing which I wanted to say.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.120
The other thing was actually a question which would be an answer also.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:05:00.120
And the question was what could really harm us.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.120
And then, I mean there might be ten thousand cathodic priests cursing us.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.120
These will never harm us.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.120
But there might be one yogi who thinks badly about another one.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.120
This will harm us.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:21.120
It's one of the greatest traps for us at that level where we are now.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:27.120
Because we are completely protected by our holy mother. We are.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:38.120
But if one cell of Shri Mataji's body fights with the other cell, it's like a cancer for Shri Mataji.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:44.120
Because she took us into her body.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:51.120
It doesn't have to go to that level where we fight.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.120
It starts with the subtle.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.120
It starts with hatred in our heart.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.120
And hatred has many faces.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.120
It doesn't mean to have to face only that you want to kill some person.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.120
Hatred can be much more subtle.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:16.120
Whenever we think with some rage, some right side coming up about another person,

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.120
hatred has already won us over.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:28.120
Whenever something else but love flows from us, hatred has already won.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.120
It's something so subtle.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.120
Whenever we get upset about another yogi,

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.120
hatred again has won our hearts.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:43.120
And this is something which I feel a dreamy,

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.120
and maybe the only thing which could harm the progress of Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:54.120
If we start fighting against each other.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:02.120
So let's keep on the subtle level our heart pure towards our brothers and sisters.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:08.120
Which does not mean, I mean there are two benches of people who are supposed to tell people

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.120
if they find that something is going wrong.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.120
And it's always a temptation.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.120
Because especially us, I can only talk about myself.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:24.120
I mean who is becoming leader? Mostly people who have something in the right side also.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.120
So I'm talking about myself only, I never can talk about others.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.120
Of course there is the tendency that the right side takes us over.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:39.120
As Gregor has said, you push the ego out of the door and it comes back through the window.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:45.120
And then it's so difficult to get, to keep the heart clean.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:52.120
If some person has to be sad, listen, if you do that, it's going to harm us.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.120
But still, it's a game.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:02.120
In that game the only thing we can do is, I feel, just keep our heart completely clean.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.120
Keep our heart completely clean.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.120
Never let any hatred enter our hearts.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:17.120
Never let any feeling that somebody else has less value than us, enter our hearts.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.120
Keep a complete respect towards others.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.120
Whether the babies are crying or not.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.120
Whether they stay there for two hours or not, doesn't matter, whatever it is.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.120
We might face hundred situations per day where we have the chance, the options,

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.120
either to get angry or not, or to keep the love flow.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.120
Let's keep the love flow amongst each other.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:09:03.120
I want to really strongly underline and support what Wolfman has said.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:14.120
And I want to add a short thing that helps me personally and might help you also.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:26.120
That when we are very aware and very focused in our attention,

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:34.120
and then we know almost a second when a negative thought

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:41.120
or maybe some hidden influence within us starts working,

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:49.120
starts giving us intentions, thoughts, emotions, which we are not.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:56.120
But when we are aware of that and we increase the awareness,

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:01.120
what we actually do is to witness the evil.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:09.120
And by that immediately this primary evil state diminishes

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.120
and the weakness state increases.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:21.120
This is a subtle inner process which can be simply trained every day.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.660
I began with an intimate speech that

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:47.660
supports this whole meaning.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:52.360
And I made note of the pullback to the tape.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:00.160
And this is a truly positive experience of Segaju musem.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.060
Thank you very much.

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:08.480
IÂ´d just like to say something.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:13.480
When Shri Mataji explained to me the relationship between man and woman,

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:20.480
we respect the fact that you want to be yourself, as in Sahaja Yoga is about becoming yourself.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:26.480
It's not about becoming something which is a stereotype. We all agree on that.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.480
But when I understood the relationship between man and woman, Shri Mataji asked me to look at the bulb.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.480
You see the bulb over there?

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:43.480
Okay, so the God is the bulb and the Goddess is electricity.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:51.480
Now which one is more important? The bulb or the electricity?

01:12:51.480 --> 01:13:02.480
Without the electricity, the bulb has no meaning. But without the bulb, the electricity cannot show.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:11.480
So, it helped me to understand. And if a Lakshmi, that is a married woman in Sahaja,

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:20.480
is okay, then we say, Philip's eyes is the bulb, but Osana is the electricity.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:26.480
So who should we thank? Whenever Philip does something,

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.480
or I should say when I like Redouard, that's something which has vibration.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.480
Maybe three-quarters of the credit should go to his wife.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.480
Oh!

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:51.480
You see, but if the electricity says, hey, I am the power, I don't need the bulb, it doesn't work either.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:58.480
So I think it's this new sort of understanding, that there is a complete equality,

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.480
between men and women in Sahaja, but the roles are a bit different.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:13.480
We are the sort of, we look like we are in charge, but the common post is behind, something like that.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:21.480
So, I think that the whole relationship between men and women in Sahaja does change,

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.480
because the complementarity is discovered.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:40.480
In this way, I just want to share with you what I experienced when I got married.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:49.480
There was a raki ceremony, a gala patifude, and she magically spoke to us women,

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:57.480
very very strongly, and she said to us, if you don't want to marry the girl,

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:03.480
please say no, I don't want you to make a man happy.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:10.480
Your only job is to nourish your husband with your love.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:18.480
If your husband never helps you with your husband, if your husband does something wrong,

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:26.480
just keep it on time, because all the deities and the ganas are helping you.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:33.480
And in the afternoon, I had a really good experience, to meet each other,

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.480
everybody was here experiencing their future husband.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:45.480
And I got first, I was a military team, and I was a little brother of a Shuman ji,

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.480
asking, Christine, where is your husband?

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.480
And I came back to her, and I said, I don't know Shuman ji.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:03.480
And I got to talk to people who were very excited, saying, I'm trying to find a husband,

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.480
for such a long time, and they asked me, last moment, blah blah blah.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:13.480
I said, don't, meditate, meditate, I'll try, but all thoughts came.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:19.480
A second time, Shuman ji asked me, Christine, where is your husband?

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:25.480
And again, I look at her, and I say, I don't know Shuman ji.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.480
And at this time, I am completely on the right side.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:35.480
And I said, why is he not here? You should be here, I can't go, everybody knows,

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.480
why is he not here, blah blah blah.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.480
And I couldn't stop all this.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:46.480
And I said, try to meditate, but I couldn't, the thoughts came, came, came.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.480
And a third time, I was supposed to Shuman ji.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.480
I looked at her, desperate, and I said, I don't know Shuman ji.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:01.480
And she just came back on her lap, and she was laughing, and she said, look at her,

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.480
she doesn't know who is your husband.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.480
Because she didn't ask me, where is your husband, who is your husband.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:15.480
And when I told, I was, I told him, where is your husband?

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:24.480
And at this moment, I just remember what she said in the morning, she said, just leave about now.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:30.480
So I just looked at her and I said, Shuman ji, you know where he is, I don't know.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.480
I opened my eyes and first I came, and thought of him.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.480
And Shuman ji looked at me and she said, you see, it's working.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.480
Thank you.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.480
Thoughtless awareness is very important to us.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:29.480
And I just thought this might be a good forum, where some people might share some tips on how the silence is great, silence of mind.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:38.480
We all have some techniques and we balance, and sometimes we achieve thoughtless awareness for a second or two, maybe more.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.480
Anyway, that's my question.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:56.480
Well, it's really a personal matter, I think.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:18.480
And there is one thing that helps me personally a lot is to go into the thinking about it.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:43.480
The words, she's loud, but taking the Sahasrara as a cup and taking the Paramachaitanya as, in a way as it is described many times as the divine nectar, the amrut.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:20:09.480
And when we feel that this divine nectar subtly enters the Sahasrara, and as the quality of a substance like nectar is, it starts melting, melting, melting, soothing, soothing.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:16.480
And it slowly falls down towards the Adhyam chakra.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:24.480
And it's actually the opposite movement of the Kundalini, this falling down of the nectar.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.480
But it's just a hint for the attention.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:40.480
If we practice that and sit like that, feeling that this melting process takes place, eventually the thoughts also melt.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:59.480
And on the top of it, if we visualize the lotus feet of our Divine Mother, emitting that nectar, drenching our brain and falling down, it increases that effect.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:09.480
This is a method, a technique which helps me personally.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:18.480
I would like to add something because watching you, what's your name who has asked the question? Great.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:24.480
While he was answering you, you got thoughtless, right? Exactly.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:38.480
So, Vajan is actually already hinting also the method because there are always different levels of perceiving something, hearing, listening, smelling, feeling, whatever.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:50.480
And if you had listened to any bird now, with your ordinary techniques and instruments of understanding and perceiving, you would have just received an answer.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:22:01.480
But because you are realized and you can perceive on a higher level, the higher realities and the vibrations and his vibrations,

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:10.480
and the vibrations which start flowing because of his depth and the truth of his answer, you got thoughtless.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:19.480
So, the process was catalyzed and kicked off, which is beyond the usual methods and instruments of understanding and perception.

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.480
And that is the secret how to go thoughtless.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:37.480
You always try to put your attention on the essence of everything, on the essence of everything and on the existence of divinity in everything.

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:43.480
And as soon as you put your attention on that, you go thoughtless.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.480
And that maybe also helps.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:03.480
I say my small feeling how the essence actually is working.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.480
As we understand Sahaja Yoga is working when we keep our mother pleased.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:24.480
So whatever we try, any thought starting meditation, bowing down, trying to please our mother with few thoughts at the beginning of the meditation,

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:30.480
then it's just like the cup where we are being pulled on this thought.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:48.480
I just want to say one last thing, because we have actually discussed the same subject yesterday in the car and we had very beautiful exchanges of comments and things.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:24:00.480
And then at one point it was said a very effective method of going thoughtless is putting your attention always on the highest, on the highest possible being or reality.

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.480
And that is always God. That is always God.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:20.480
And never bother yourself with achings in your body, problems in your attention, worries in your center heart or fears in your center heart, emotions or thoughts or whatever.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.480
And never try to attack them. Don't even try to witness them.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:32.480
Just immediately go with your attention to the Lord Almighty and seek His darshan.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:38.480
And then because of that desire everything will open up and everything will become calm.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:48.480
And every trouble on the way to there will automatically be sorted out and will be integrated in one flow of attention, in one flow of chaitanya, in one flow of Kundalini.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.480
And always try to put your attention on the highest possible.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:25:00.480
Because that is the easiest and fastest and most powerful way to get sucked into Sahasrara.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:06.480
Without any, you can't even help to get sucked into it. You just get sucked into it.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:18.480
One has to be very exclusive and very demanding in your desire.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.480
Don't waste your desires with cheap things but immediately go to the highest possible.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:41.480
I remember once when Eglabhat asked Shri Mataji at a public program why the Indians are more easily thoughtless.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:49.480
And she said because they know that they are there and because the Westerners are always looking to get them.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:26:01.480
So we are always looking for a method and just to realize that we are there, that Shri Mataji is already giving it to us is something that we need to learn.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:19.480
The same subject I'm sorry. It's a little anecdote. When we were children's camp there was three months since you went to Aamji.

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:27.480
Now there's children. The first evening we had a foot soak and they could not meditate.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:32.480
And I was standing there trying to make them meditate and I didn't know how to.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.480
And I was really desperate at this moment.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:43.480
And I looked at Shri Mataji's picture and somehow I was definitely telling them I'm already there. My attention is already on them.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:54.480
And they were shouting. There was no attention at all. And now they say that children are less than Shri Mataji is already here.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:01.480
And her attention is on us all the time. I'm using a pen so I can expose complete silence.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:07.480
And I'm actually looking at the music and I'm looking at the music and I'm looking at the music and I'm looking at the music.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:27.480
Let's keep the question on that level because it helps to establish and maintain the quality of my questions.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:37.480
One small addition to Greg's question. Very practically in my experience what always helps is connectivity.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:47.480
Because whatever you do alone, for example coming home from work, being held up on the right side usually and full of thoughts in the head.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:55.480
And whatever you do, foot soaping and ice pack on the lever and also trying these techniques of visualizing whatever.

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.480
In my experience, connectivity helps much more.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:08.480
When I struggle at home for 2-3 hours, it's much less effective than 10 minutes in collectivity.

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.480
So this is I think the most powerful technique.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.480
Then some questions. I don't know whether they are up to this level.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:28.480
Rather technical I would say. In the beginning I remember some 10-12 years ago we were taught first to take a bandhan and then the razor.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:38.480
If I remember correctly I think then after some time it was changed to first the razor and then the taper bandhan.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:47.480
I don't know whether there is a great significance in that but I would like to know whether you remember it in the same way and what is the meaning behind it.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.480
And still referring to what Gerhard asked before.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.480
What does make a difference after raising the Kundalini?

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.480
The first time you can make one knot after the second time.

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:06.480
I was taught when I was young in Sajeoget to make one knot after the second time and three knots after the third time.

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.480
Whereas I observe nowadays often after the second time people make two knots.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:18.480
Is there any significance behind it or is it just the way you like it?

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:26.480
We are all unfit to answer this question.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.480
I don't think to be very frank it doesn't really make a difference.

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:38.480
But it seems logical to first raise a Kundalini and then give a bandhan.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.480
It seems logical.

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:15.480
I think it is a very difficult decision to make.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.480
I think it is difficult to make.

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:23.480
I think it is difficult to make a bandhan.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:31.480
I think it is difficult to make a bandhan when you are in a natural culture.

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:37.480
I have come from a very important field.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:42.480
And I happen to be older than he is.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:48.480
He is Lesnar stage employees.

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.480
It is good for when you are on thera itemsl same withSide,

01:31:52.480 --> 01:32:14.180
context we need to different
