00:01.800 --> 00:05.489
I again see today some new faces

00:05.489 --> 00:08.849
who have come here,

00:10.869 --> 00:15.175
and I have to explain again today,

00:15.175 --> 00:20.205
for the first time to them,

00:20.215 --> 00:25.752
what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:25.755 --> 00:30.733
which has been promised in various scriptures

00:30.745 --> 00:37.005
that you have to get your Second Birth.

00:37.026 --> 00:39.490
You have to be born again.

00:39.515 --> 00:43.328
It is said. Christ has said too,

00:43.353 --> 00:45.853
the same thing.

00:47.870 --> 00:51.860
But people have not been able to ponder

00:51.866 --> 00:58.930
on this subject: what does that mean – our Second Birth?

00:58.955 --> 01:03.172
Are we not already born as human beings?

01:03.172 --> 01:06.452
We are born

01:06.462 --> 01:08.762
but the human beings, which are born,

01:08.787 --> 01:12.057
are told that you are to be 'born again.'

01:12.082 --> 01:14.874
Now what are we going to do?

01:14.899 --> 01:19.884
So they asked, "Are we to enter
into our mother's womb again?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.564
And are to be born again?"

01:23.570 --> 01:30.630
He said, :You'll be born of the
Holy Ghost, of the Holy Spirit."

01:30.644 --> 01:36.640
The Holy Ghost that He talked
about is the Kundalini within us.

01:36.651 --> 01:39.151
She is the part of the Holy Ghost,

01:39.151 --> 01:42.573
or you can say the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

01:42.593 --> 01:48.773
which exists as all-pervading power.

01:48.797 --> 01:54.227
Actually the all-pervading power of Divine Love

01:54.230 --> 02:00.244
is the love of Holy Ghost or Her aura.

02:00.269 --> 02:06.774
This is reflected within us, as the power of desire

02:08.598 --> 02:17.544
as shown in the picture in
the triangular bone of sacrum

02:17.986 --> 02:21.305
and coils itself in three and a half rounds.

02:27.186 --> 02:32.826
If you could ask the child to play there,
it would be better. Whose child is this?

02:36.838 --> 02:41.165
Children don't understand all, they
need not understand. They are all right.

02:41.165 --> 02:45.085
They're realised. They're enjoying themselves.

02:53.356 --> 02:58.774
This force, which is called as residual force,

02:58.799 --> 03:02.550
is the desire of God,

03:02.575 --> 03:13.035
which resides within us in a dormant way.

03:13.060 --> 03:17.368
We actually do not know what is the desire of God.

03:17.385 --> 03:20.256
We have our own conclusions,
our own conceptions,

03:20.257 --> 03:23.438
our own ideas that I am doing the work of God.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.219
But you are not yet connected with God,

03:25.219 --> 03:28.179
how can you do the work of God?

03:28.204 --> 03:30.704
There is no way of really establishing

03:30.704 --> 03:33.204
any actual rapport with God,

03:33.204 --> 03:36.159
and how can you say that you are related to God

03:36.159 --> 03:38.659
or you are doing the work of God?

03:38.659 --> 03:42.317
It’s all right that God is looking after you,

03:42.317 --> 03:44.227
He is managing you,

03:44.227 --> 03:46.889
He has given you this life, is correct.

03:46.889 --> 03:51.841
But there is no way of finding God

03:51.847 --> 03:53.872
in your conscious mind.

03:53.897 --> 03:56.397
It's just your mental activity

03:56.397 --> 03:58.872
maybe your ego,

03:58.897 --> 04:02.332
which says, "I am God."

04:02.357 --> 04:06.662
Some people say, "I like it!"

04:06.687 --> 04:09.187
But why do you like it?

04:09.187 --> 04:11.295
Because I think, I like it.

04:11.327 --> 04:15.165
Then, why, whatever you think is your own.

04:15.165 --> 04:16.835
It is not God’s,

04:16.845 --> 04:26.565
how do you say, with such cock-sure attitude

04:26.569 --> 04:30.805
that you are connected with God?

04:30.810 --> 04:32.958
Then they will start discussing about it.

04:32.983 --> 04:35.483
They sit down and talk about it

04:35.483 --> 04:39.183
Yesterday only we had a very funny visitor in Paris

04:39.183 --> 04:43.383
and he started it like a tape record

04:43.393 --> 04:47.193
and he just started telling Me what he thinks.

04:47.205 --> 04:50.615
But your thinking is your own imagination.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.140
There is no actual experience in it.

04:53.154 --> 04:56.606
There is no actuality.

04:56.616 --> 05:00.508
I said, "This is fanaticism."

05:00.533 --> 05:03.033
When you start thinking about something

05:03.033 --> 05:08.501
and accept it as real, then it is fanaticism, of any kind.

05:08.526 --> 05:13.344
You can be a football fanatic.

05:13.456 --> 05:16.206
You think that a particular person must win.

05:16.206 --> 05:18.706
It becomes sort of your thinking.

05:18.706 --> 05:21.206
Then that person must win, if he does not win

05:21.206 --> 05:24.656
then you are going to kill everybody else.

05:24.656 --> 05:26.776
If you go a little further with it,

05:26.776 --> 05:35.650
you think that you are a great benevolent person.

05:35.675 --> 05:37.488
Then whatever you think,

05:37.505 --> 05:41.823
you feel that this is the thing that is going to bring benevolence to people.

05:41.848 --> 05:43.928
but what is the proof?

05:43.928 --> 05:50.642
That what you think is the thing wanted by God.

05:50.658 --> 05:51.868
All your thinking

05:51.868 --> 05:58.493
is based either on your conditioning,

05:58.518 --> 05:59.648
whatever you have read,

05:59.658 --> 06:01.444
if you are born a Christian all your thinking

06:01.488 --> 06:03.416
will be Christian thinking means church's

06:03.441 --> 06:05.738
thinking not God's thinking.

06:05.743 --> 06:09.219
If you are a Hindu, you will think like a Hindu

06:09.219 --> 06:11.719
of a temple or some sort of a Guru

06:11.719 --> 06:14.219
or somebody who has taught you something.

06:14.219 --> 06:18.940
If you are a Muslim you might become Khomeini

06:18.979 --> 06:21.479
anything is possible!

06:21.479 --> 06:23.029
Are we going in the same direction

06:23.029 --> 06:24.868
with our thinking?

06:24.893 --> 06:28.900
Or are we related to God?

06:28.903 --> 06:31.890
First, relationship with God must be established.

06:31.890 --> 06:34.390
That is extremely important

06:34.390 --> 06:36.890
before we talk of God

06:36.890 --> 06:41.128
because all our thinking is our conditioning

06:41.153 --> 06:44.538
or else our imagination.

06:44.563 --> 06:48.204
There are some people who met Me they said they have met God.

06:48.229 --> 06:50.791
I said, "Really?  How, how does he look like?"

06:50.816 --> 06:52.582
"Oh, I met him on the street."

06:52.602 --> 06:53.632
I said, "Very good."

06:53.632 --> 06:56.132
And somebody says, "I am Christ."

06:56.132 --> 06:58.632
Somebody says, "I am Krishna."

06:58.632 --> 07:02.778
But what is the proof?

07:02.872 --> 07:05.372
I mean, supposing I say this is gold.

07:05.372 --> 07:07.627
Then gold has a density.

07:07.632 --> 07:09.877
You can find out whether it is gold or silver

07:09.902 --> 07:12.127
or something but you cannot just go on saying,

07:12.127 --> 07:18.380
“I think it is gold." So it becomes gold, can it?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.532
In the same way our faith,

07:20.557 --> 07:24.680
because we think we have a belief in it,

07:24.697 --> 07:27.740
is mythical – as far as you are concerned,

07:27.740 --> 07:29.965
as far as anybody else is concerned.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.480
Unless and until you give the proof of God,

07:32.480 --> 07:34.655
nobody is going to believe in God any further,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.375
I can tell you this much.

07:36.375 --> 07:39.656
And this is the reason another mythical stuff is coming up

07:39.681 --> 07:41.230
is that there is no God.

07:41.255 --> 07:44.845
This is another myth.

07:44.851 --> 07:47.351
Either to believe that you are connected with God

07:47.351 --> 07:50.112
is equally mythical as to say there is no God.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.719
Because if you have not met Him

07:51.744 --> 07:53.379
how do you say, there is not? There may be,

07:53.404 --> 07:57.081
may not be – is a better situation.

07:57.087 --> 07:59.587
Just to denounce Him that there is no God,

07:59.587 --> 08:02.087
is another myth.

08:02.087 --> 08:04.587
We some how or other managed to live with a myth.

08:04.587 --> 08:08.774
It’s very comfortable to live with myth.

08:08.777 --> 08:12.264
It’s a comfortable life; we do not want to give up our comforts.

08:12.264 --> 08:14.394
As just now, I was telling someone

08:14.394 --> 08:18.244
that a little shell contains a little oyster in it.

08:18.244 --> 08:21.226
Now, the oyster doesn’t want to get out of the shell.

08:21.226 --> 08:23.726
It’s quite comfortable.

08:23.726 --> 08:27.594
And a little bit of a sand comes in

08:27.599 --> 08:36.550
and it sat troubling the comfort of the oyster.

08:36.564 --> 08:41.380
So, oyster takes out his saliva

08:41.410 --> 08:44.150
goes round it, makes it softer,

08:44.150 --> 08:47.080
puts it there, curls up a little bit of its body

08:47.080 --> 08:48.896
and says, “Now I am comfortable now I'm

08:48.910 --> 08:50.336
very satisfied, it’s all right.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.316
The shell is the thing for me."

08:52.320 --> 08:54.820
And that’s how we go on living with the shell

08:54.820 --> 08:57.696
avoiding understanding

08:57.706 --> 09:03.816
that this shell is not the thing we are seeking.

09:03.836 --> 09:08.026
So, one has to get out of that
comfortable feeling one has.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.540
If you have a house, very nice!

09:10.540 --> 09:12.505
I’ve got children, very nice!

09:12.530 --> 09:14.990
I’ve got a wife, I’ve got a car. It's all right.

09:14.990 --> 09:19.615
I am very comfortable, I am very satisfied.

09:22.860 --> 09:27.746
But then, certain calamities come in.

09:27.814 --> 09:30.907
You are faced with them.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.274
Problems come in

09:34.300 --> 09:38.746
and then you think,

09:38.750 --> 09:41.250
"I never waited for this.

09:41.266 --> 09:43.766
It was most unexpected."

09:46.046 --> 09:49.347
There are another set of people,

09:49.366 --> 09:54.397
who think – who ‘think’, again!

09:54.406 --> 10:02.366
that they have to search God.

10:02.386 --> 10:08.857
And that’s how they jump into sea.

10:08.866 --> 10:12.287
They jump into fire, they jump into water,

10:12.312 --> 10:13.897
they jump into all kinds of things

10:13.897 --> 10:19.088
without understanding what danger it entails.

10:19.108 --> 10:21.507
So one side we have a comfortably coiled up

10:21.538 --> 10:23.768
an oyster and another is an oyster

10:23.778 --> 10:25.534
which is burnt up

10:25.559 --> 10:33.555
which is either drowned or something.

10:33.568 --> 10:39.905
So what should a human being do?

10:39.915 --> 10:44.445
He should be comfortable,

10:44.445 --> 10:46.411
but all the time he should think that

10:46.436 --> 10:50.631
“I have not yet met God, I must meet.

10:50.955 --> 10:53.414
I have to watch and see,

10:53.424 --> 10:57.204
I have to understand."

10:57.204 --> 10:59.704
Oyster in the shell

10:59.704 --> 11:03.608
is better sometimes

11:03.608 --> 11:09.478
than the oyster, which is completely fried out.

11:09.478 --> 11:11.978
But the oyster in the shell

11:11.978 --> 11:14.478
will die its own death.

11:14.478 --> 11:17.433
But there is a possibility about the oyster

11:17.433 --> 11:22.753
which has come out that he might meet something.

11:22.872 --> 11:26.296
Because he is a seeker

11:26.296 --> 11:29.716
God also looks after him,

11:29.739 --> 11:33.786
God also wants to help.

11:33.806 --> 11:36.226
If he could listen to his own unconscious,

11:36.246 --> 11:39.296
he could work it out.

11:42.276 --> 11:46.221
Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing.

11:46.256 --> 11:48.461
Sahaja means ‘spontaneous’.

11:48.466 --> 11:50.966
Everything that happens in life is spontaneous.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.576
From amoeba to this stage, you have come

11:53.576 --> 11:58.206
spontaneously, 'Sahaja,' born with you.

11:58.206 --> 12:01.506
It is within you!

12:06.706 --> 12:10.812
Gradually, as a seed sprouts into a flower

12:10.812 --> 12:13.312
and then the fragrance starts emitting out

12:13.312 --> 12:14.488
from the flower,

12:14.488 --> 12:21.332
in the same way it is all built in you.

12:21.332 --> 12:26.492
You don’t have to go anywhere, it is between

12:26.635 --> 12:29.776
your own thinking

12:29.795 --> 12:36.366
and your desiring, it resides.

12:38.916 --> 12:42.256
You desire something

12:42.266 --> 12:45.656
and you don’t think about it

12:45.676 --> 12:48.732
that is the best way you can do.

12:48.732 --> 12:51.232
We have two capacities within us,

12:51.232 --> 12:55.779
one is to desire. With this left side,

12:55.793 --> 13:02.339
the deep blue coloured channel within us,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.499
the desire.

13:04.519 --> 13:16.984
It manifests outside as left sympathetic nervous system,

13:17.013 --> 13:21.773
which is our emotional side,

13:21.773 --> 13:26.907
which is responsible for collecting all our past,

13:26.932 --> 13:29.334
all our experiences, all our conditioning.

13:29.359 --> 13:31.143
This is the psyche about which

13:31.156 --> 13:35.622
the psychologists are worried.

13:35.623 --> 13:38.409
So, we desire.

13:38.802 --> 13:43.272
And the right side one, the yellow coloured line

13:43.292 --> 13:46.858
represents the power by which we maintain

13:46.883 --> 13:49.383
our physical being

13:49.795 --> 13:55.749
and ultimately we start thinking.

13:55.755 --> 13:59.699
Between these two resides

13:59.699 --> 14:02.209
the power of our evolution.

14:04.289 --> 14:06.235
So we have left side and right side

14:06.269 --> 14:08.065
sympathetic nervous system,

14:08.069 --> 14:10.569
manifested in the gross, and in the centre

14:10.569 --> 14:13.365
is the parasympathetic.

14:13.379 --> 14:15.279
Parasympathetic is a system

14:15.304 --> 14:17.804
which shows how much we have evolved so far.

14:17.909 --> 14:20.652
How much we have achieved so far up to

14:20.662 --> 14:23.532
human level.

14:23.555 --> 14:26.055
Only human beings think that

14:26.055 --> 14:32.571
they have to achieve God, not animals.

14:32.575 --> 14:34.501
They have reached that state that they think

14:34.526 --> 14:36.059
that they have to achieve God,

14:36.091 --> 14:39.734
they desire that they have to achieve God.

14:39.741 --> 14:45.681
There is a gap between their achievement

14:45.706 --> 14:48.648
and there is the desire.

14:48.751 --> 14:52.842
This is to be crossed.

14:52.842 --> 14:58.575
But their desire cannot work it out,

14:58.752 --> 15:03.082
only their desire can call for the help from God,

15:03.082 --> 15:05.582
and the God’s desire is within you

15:05.582 --> 15:10.202
in this triangular bone lying dormant.

15:10.212 --> 15:15.562
This God’s desire is called as Kundalini.

15:15.572 --> 15:18.072
That God’s desire has to rise within you,

15:18.072 --> 15:23.185
and it is He who has to give you the Second Birth

15:23.205 --> 15:25.195
or you can say that the She, the Mother,

15:25.205 --> 15:28.513
has to give you the Second Birth.

15:28.513 --> 15:30.627
This is the Holy Ghost

15:30.643 --> 15:33.143
about which Christ could not talk

15:33.143 --> 15:36.737
to those mad people who really crucified Him.

15:36.743 --> 15:41.417
They were mad that they thought that Christ

15:41.427 --> 15:46.809
was blasphemous.

15:46.809 --> 15:48.349
Just think of it!

15:48.349 --> 15:50.439
And today we have churches and people,

15:50.439 --> 15:52.939
and this and that.

15:56.029 --> 15:58.069
When He lived nobody accepted Him,

15:58.069 --> 16:02.259
nobody recognised Him

16:02.259 --> 16:04.209
When He came, they talked of Moses,

16:04.209 --> 16:08.599
Abraham.

16:08.599 --> 16:11.400
It is very nice to handle Christ,

16:11.425 --> 16:13.329
better talk about them, so that  we don't have

16:13.329 --> 16:15.829
to face reality.

16:15.829 --> 16:18.329
Because if they had recognised Christ

16:18.329 --> 16:20.210
then Christ would have said, "All right

16:20.235 --> 16:22.078
if you are recognising Me, then get your

16:22.078 --> 16:27.108
Realisation

16:27.121 --> 16:29.505
and understand yourself.”

16:29.530 --> 16:31.506
They where not prepared for this.

16:31.531 --> 16:33.819
Only twelve people somehow – you see

16:33.844 --> 16:36.241
managed to be there, somehow.

16:36.437 --> 16:42.624
They would not accept Him either.

16:42.681 --> 16:46.761
Till He was resurrected

16:46.786 --> 16:50.861
then they accepted Him, in a way.

16:50.881 --> 16:52.531
And then, what are you going to do

16:52.539 --> 16:56.191
but to create a myth around it.

16:56.199 --> 16:57.759
And to say that, “Of course,

16:57.759 --> 16:58.989
we believed in Christ.”

16:59.002 --> 17:02.205
Now what, which Christ did you believe in?

17:02.215 --> 17:05.435
Because that Christ, whom you had to face

17:05.435 --> 17:08.385
you did not face.

17:08.410 --> 17:12.110
And now you live in imaginary world,

17:12.135 --> 17:14.846
you have your own paradise about it.

17:14.871 --> 17:17.576
Where does He live within us?

17:17.601 --> 17:23.591
Has He created any position within us?

17:23.591 --> 17:26.391
Is there any meaning to His life,

17:26.398 --> 17:30.791
which has left a permanent mark within us

17:30.791 --> 17:33.291
Was He one of the
mile-stones within us?

17:33.291 --> 17:37.261
If so – where does He reside within us?

17:37.269 --> 17:39.185
How can we be connected to him?

17:39.210 --> 17:42.557
Nobody made any exploration about it.

17:42.582 --> 17:45.916
Again the comfortable shell started.

17:45.942 --> 17:47.796
It has happened not once,

17:47.832 --> 17:50.015
thousands of years it has been happening,

17:50.022 --> 17:52.265
whenever an Incarnation came on this Earth

17:52.302 --> 17:56.845
that’s how they behaved.

17:56.852 --> 18:00.182
When Rama came they said,
“We believe in Parashurama”,

18:00.188 --> 18:01.652
when Krishna came they said,

18:01.684 --> 18:03.932
"We believe in Rama."

18:03.984 --> 18:08.552
Same thing with Christ, with everyone.

18:08.598 --> 18:11.048
But you better now recognise

18:11.104 --> 18:15.638
and know yourself, and face it once for all,

18:15.639 --> 18:17.658
the time has come.

18:17.658 --> 18:20.639
How long are you going to live with your myths?

18:20.639 --> 18:24.108
The time has come.

18:24.133 --> 18:31.608
It has nothing to do with
East, West or North and South.

18:31.623 --> 18:34.123
Most amazing is that in the West,

18:34.123 --> 18:38.484
people are afraid that this is Eastern knowledge.

18:38.503 --> 18:41.282
The other day only one lady who is a Realised Soul,

18:41.307 --> 18:43.044
her son is a Realised Soul.

18:43.044 --> 18:45.544
They said their teacher was very anxious

18:45.544 --> 18:47.964
about my son, because he said, "Why are you

18:47.964 --> 18:50.464
giving this Eastern knowledge to him?"

18:50.464 --> 18:53.814
How can it be Eastern? It is universal knowledge

18:53.814 --> 18:56.314
I said, "Why don't you go and ask the teacher

18:56.314 --> 19:01.179
was Christ born in England or in America?

19:03.459 --> 19:05.959
His cross is even, you can find it

19:05.959 --> 19:13.923
on the airport of London.

19:15.897 --> 19:18.647
Because I think that Christ was an Englishman.

19:18.855 --> 19:20.517
So it’s all right, he has to – poor thing

19:20.542 --> 19:24.425
has to become an Englishman. What to do?

19:24.649 --> 19:27.957
This knowledge cannot be limited to Indians

19:27.982 --> 19:30.510
or to English or to anyone.

19:30.535 --> 19:34.184
It is God’s knowledge, it is for everyone of you

19:34.209 --> 19:39.155
it is your right to know.

19:39.165 --> 19:43.465
All of you have got Kundalini.

19:43.465 --> 19:45.965
You can see with your naked eyes its pulsation;

19:45.976 --> 19:48.476
you can see its rising.

19:48.539 --> 19:50.953
You can see its piercing through,

19:50.953 --> 19:52.685
you can feel it, it throbbing here.

19:52.685 --> 19:56.050
You can see the piercing.

19:56.074 --> 19:57.660
You can see, when it pierces through,

19:57.670 --> 20:00.980
how you become actually collectively conscious.

20:00.982 --> 20:05.780
You do become.

20:05.780 --> 20:10.842
It’s a fact! And how can you avoid fact?

20:10.926 --> 20:13.333
And why should you avoid?

20:13.333 --> 20:16.923
Because reality is so beautiful,

20:16.923 --> 20:19.223
why should we be afraid of facing the reality,

20:19.223 --> 20:21.723
which is so beautiful.

20:21.727 --> 20:25.233
There was a gentleman in Paris

20:25.233 --> 20:27.733
who got his Realisation and two days he was

20:27.733 --> 20:30.032
just laughing out of joy and he said,

20:30.032 --> 20:32.052
“I’ve never laughed all my life

20:32.052 --> 20:34.192
as I have laughed now” and just out of joy

20:34.192 --> 20:36.692
he was laughing;

20:36.692 --> 20:39.552
so joyous. He said, "Mother let me laugh now

20:39.552 --> 20:42.382
and enjoy myself, I'm really living."

20:42.382 --> 20:44.107
Actually he told me that he never believed

20:44.117 --> 20:46.137
in God, to begin with.

20:46.144 --> 20:49.132
He thought he was a very rational being.

20:49.152 --> 20:55.462
I said, rational beings are still half,

20:55.482 --> 20:57.504
because they are dealing with something

20:57.504 --> 21:01.299
so limited, is rationality.

21:05.704 --> 21:08.829
We have to cross these barriers of rationality,

21:08.854 --> 21:11.354
and something is already within you,

21:11.354 --> 21:13.854
God has placed within you because it is his

21:13.854 --> 21:17.198
desire that you should know Him,

21:17.198 --> 21:19.464
that His power should flow through you

21:19.468 --> 21:23.094
and that you should be the citizen of His kingdom,

21:23.094 --> 21:25.364
that He is your generous Father and He's

21:25.408 --> 21:30.929
and He has made all these arrangements for you.

21:31.208 --> 21:35.138
Now, 75% people sitting here are Realised Souls.

21:35.183 --> 21:42.608
I’m so very happy, because I struggled
with six of them for four years.

21:42.618 --> 21:47.878
It is such a remarkable thing

21:47.901 --> 21:51.538
but it is very, very hard for people to believe

21:51.550 --> 21:55.328
that you have to get an experience of God,

21:55.328 --> 21:59.247
you have to feel Him within yourself.

21:59.274 --> 22:06.197
As an actualisation, you have to
feel Him in your conscious mind.

22:06.217 --> 22:09.297
Because if religion gets organised

22:09.297 --> 22:13.170
you also get beliefs organised.

22:13.187 --> 22:16.837
Then, whatever they say becomes perfect;

22:16.850 --> 22:21.755
blind leading the blind.

22:23.570 --> 22:28.285
You cannot organise God, you cannot.

22:28.325 --> 22:31.835
He will organise.

22:31.855 --> 22:35.485
You cannot conceive Him.

22:35.505 --> 22:38.785
He has to conceive you.

22:38.785 --> 22:41.935
His Grace must come on you.

22:41.945 --> 22:46.255
You have to ask for his Grace.

22:46.275 --> 22:50.275
He has already placed His desire within you.

22:50.297 --> 22:55.265
And this desire resides as Kundalini.

22:55.290 --> 22:59.656
You have heard so much about
Kundalini before also, I believe.

22:59.656 --> 23:01.633
Maybe you must have read some horrible books,

23:01.643 --> 23:03.453
which are shown, to Me,

23:03.473 --> 23:05.661
that this Kundalini gives you jerks,

23:05.686 --> 23:08.113
and you start jumping and you start making

23:08.113 --> 23:11.428
noises and things like that.

23:11.453 --> 23:13.913
At the very outset, I must tell you

23:13.913 --> 23:17.883
that it is the desire of God, which is your Mother.

23:17.903 --> 23:23.687
And this Mother is your own Mother

23:23.720 --> 23:25.973
You do not have

23:25.980 --> 23:28.003
any other Mother but this Mother

23:28.003 --> 23:32.507
and She does not have any child but you.

23:32.508 --> 23:34.143
Do you think such a Mother

23:34.143 --> 23:37.263
who has been waiting to give you this rebirth

23:37.263 --> 23:41.273
would be in any way troublesome to you?

23:41.283 --> 23:46.943
Even your physical mother bore all the pains
upon herself to give you birth.

23:46.943 --> 23:52.786
Then why should this Mother try to trouble you?

23:52.786 --> 23:58.193
Then people asked Me, "Then how did
these people talk of these things?

23:58.193 --> 23:59.551
I mean you can talk of anything

23:59.576 --> 24:02.941
if you want to befool people.

24:02.956 --> 24:06.186
If you want to befool people, can’t you?

24:06.206 --> 24:09.396
I mean, if you indulge into such a thing you
can. You can get possessed by somebody

24:09.396 --> 24:14.165
also, that you start writing all these nonsensical things.

24:16.036 --> 24:17.995
So many mythical things have been written

24:18.020 --> 24:21.329
apart from that, those who write that Kundalini
gives you jerks and all that

24:21.354 --> 24:25.596
maybe the people, who were something like
villagers coming and touching the electricity

24:25.596 --> 24:32.156
at a wrong point and getting a shock and maligning
the electricity, maybe the unauthorised people,

24:32.165 --> 24:34.665
who did not know anything about Kundalini.

24:34.665 --> 24:40.225
For Kundalini can only be awakened by an authorised
person who is authorised by God.

24:40.236 --> 24:47.746
not by theological college or by any Pandit
or by any Ayurveda school or anything.

24:47.754 --> 24:51.186
Christ never went to any theological college.

24:56.274 --> 24:59.246
It cannot be done by any such person

24:59.246 --> 25:02.656
who says he will read books and raise the Kundalini.

25:02.676 --> 25:05.176
It’s not the mechanism that works out that way.

25:05.176 --> 25:08.737
You cannot even sprout a seed by reading.

25:08.762 --> 25:11.082
Can you?

25:11.082 --> 25:15.006
You have done nothing living by reading.

25:17.262 --> 25:22.327
How can you raise Kundalini by reading?

25:25.648 --> 25:32.734
This is in your every day-to-day life we really
lack sometimes common sense.

25:34.053 --> 25:40.753
We go and read something,

25:40.764 --> 25:47.193
we think by reading something we are going
to go to God,

25:47.193 --> 25:52.657
or we then sit down and discuss about it.

25:52.682 --> 25:56.522
You cannot do anything by this reading, which
is just a dead thing!

25:56.542 --> 26:00.731
All your arguments, everything is dead.

26:00.756 --> 26:04.906
It is not yet enlightened; otherwise every word
could be living.

26:04.926 --> 26:06.826
That’s the Mantra.

26:06.842 --> 26:11.176
The word that is living is the Mantra.

26:12.630 --> 26:16.460
These holy words,

26:16.480 --> 26:18.980
if spoken by a person who is not enlightened

26:18.980 --> 26:21.250
has no meaning at all.

26:21.260 --> 26:24.620
If it is spoken by a person, who is enlightened,

26:24.630 --> 26:28.678
because enlightenment
means he is related to God

26:28.703 --> 26:30.330
and he can address to God

26:30.330 --> 26:32.830
like you get connected.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.975
All right, if it is done, done, nothing to worry.

26:40.984 --> 26:43.484
Nothing to feel bad, if some people have been

26:43.484 --> 26:45.984
very fanatically involved into it,

26:45.985 --> 26:47.826
it doesn’t matter.

26:47.885 --> 26:51.236
Makes no difference at all today, I feel.

26:51.265 --> 26:53.456
All kinds of things, whatever are done are done

26:53.466 --> 26:55.536
in the past, finished.

26:55.536 --> 26:58.036
We have to get our Realisation.

26:58.036 --> 27:00.536
We have to actualise ourselves.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.921
This is the main point.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.791
We are seeking ourselves.

27:03.791 --> 27:05.691
Unless and until you realise yourself

27:05.691 --> 27:08.781
you don’t have to even believe in Me,

27:08.781 --> 27:11.281
but you should not deny Me.

27:12.645 --> 27:19.016
I would not like anybody to believe in Me, blindly,

27:19.016 --> 27:24.695
because blind people cannot get it.

27:24.696 --> 27:27.849
But you should not be also closed

27:27.856 --> 27:32.539
because closed people also cannot get it.

27:32.556 --> 27:36.291
When you get it then you must believe,

27:36.316 --> 27:38.441
that is what is called as 'Shraddha.'

27:38.466 --> 27:41.385
In Sanskrit language, there two things are;

27:41.396 --> 27:49.004
one is blind faith and another is Shraddha,

27:49.004 --> 27:53.244
that is faith, pure faith.

27:53.244 --> 27:57.324
But in English we have to use an adjective

27:57.364 --> 27:59.704
that blind faith and faith.

27:59.714 --> 28:02.007
But people are so confused that they forget

28:02.032 --> 28:03.567
the adjective of blind,

28:03.614 --> 28:06.256
and they think my faith is... If your faith is that

28:06.256 --> 28:11.730
one has to accept it.

28:11.746 --> 28:15.826
But your faith should be such that it is based

28:15.836 --> 28:22.114
on the truth.

28:22.116 --> 28:28.074
Then you become an enlightened person.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.937
After all God has made us into human beings,

28:30.941 --> 28:32.947
He has given us this nose, eyes, everything.

28:32.947 --> 28:35.447
We have done nothing about it.

28:35.447 --> 28:40.716
And if He has made us for a purpose, He is going
to connect us, He is going to do it.

28:40.741 --> 28:41.904
It’s His job

28:41.904 --> 28:46.034
If He does not do it, He will have no meaning,
His creation will have no meaning.

28:46.034 --> 28:49.374
It is His job!

28:52.873 --> 28:57.877
And besides that somebody else wants to do
it for you, why should you worry?

28:57.900 --> 29:00.400
Once you get it, you can do it, too.

29:00.400 --> 29:09.550
Like one light enlightened can
enlighten another light, you can do it.

29:09.565 --> 29:13.880
Today I wanted to talk a little bit,

29:13.910 --> 29:18.400
because 75 % are Sahaja Yogis, who are Realised
Souls and who know Sahaja Yoga, they have

29:18.411 --> 29:22.890
given Realisation to so many, they have cured
people and I mean they are just there.

29:23.670 --> 29:30.458
And I was very happy that in Paris so many
of them achieved their Nirvikalpa,

29:30.460 --> 29:34.910
which is... we call as the Doubtless Awareness.

29:34.910 --> 29:39.520
The first state is the Thoughtless Awareness.

29:39.529 --> 29:44.340
Awareness means, 'Enlightened
Awareness,' you can say,

29:44.380 --> 29:50.749
'Samadhi' is the one where your awareness
becomes enlightened.

29:50.751 --> 29:54.936
The first state is of Thoughtless Awareness.

29:54.951 --> 29:58.846
And then you jump into your Realisation,

29:58.856 --> 30:03.236
but still the state is not established.

30:03.251 --> 30:11.001
You mature then as Doubtless Awareness,

30:11.013 --> 30:17.003
and this Doubtless Awareness is a state, is not
a thing. “Now I have no doubts about Sahaja

30:17.013 --> 30:21.433
Yoga”, that’s not the way. It's a state,

30:21.443 --> 30:27.718
where the rhythm of these vibrations,
or the rhythm of these radiations

30:27.743 --> 30:32.301
achieve a certain depth and a rhythm,

30:32.326 --> 30:39.196
which then you yourself start seeing that these
doubts are something separate and you build

30:39.206 --> 30:46.526
up your own reserve against them. It's not
mental state, it is the state of the being.

30:46.547 --> 30:57.520
You can say a seed becoming a fruit and maturing,

30:57.520 --> 31:01.107
or you can say a flower becoming a fruit

31:01.132 --> 31:04.620
and then the fruit maturing.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.836
In this way, first you get your Self Realisation

31:07.836 --> 31:10.336
and you get your Thoughtless Awareness.

31:10.336 --> 31:13.479
And then you get your Doubtless Awareness.

31:13.504 --> 31:16.138
But people who are not complicated so much,

31:16.163 --> 31:19.268
uncomplicated people, simple people,

31:19.282 --> 31:27.290
with proper life, not extremist, not crazy about anything,

31:27.315 --> 31:33.195
such simple people can get doubtless awareness at the first shot.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.521
They get both things together.

31:35.542 --> 31:38.449
We have many people like that

31:40.590 --> 31:47.332
but because in the West we have had too much of rambling  in our thinking

31:47.346 --> 31:50.247
we go a little round about way.

31:50.255 --> 31:54.517
We get our realization, after realization we start verifying it.

31:54.542 --> 31:57.190
Mother has said all right, these vibrations, let me try

31:57.215 --> 32:00.130
and then let me see the Kundalini rises and let me see

32:00.152 --> 32:03.990
the Mantras, what She has said about the deities whether it’s correct or not,

32:04.015 --> 32:08.222
whether these chakras are alright, or not you start verifying it through your brain.

32:08.247 --> 32:10.254
You go round and round and round.

32:11.001 --> 32:14.192
That's why the first thing you get is...

32:14.217 --> 32:16.950
your attention gets enlightened.

32:16.980 --> 32:21.490
You put your attention to someone and you
know about that person on your fingers.

32:21.500 --> 32:26.890
You can feel their centres and then you know
through decoding what centres.

32:26.902 --> 32:33.120
Supposing somebody is having a heart-attack
or something you can feel it on this finger,

32:33.139 --> 32:38.117
a heat, or a kind of a spasm,
sometimes and sometimes numbness.

32:38.127 --> 32:43.436
If a person is going to die, you feel a numbness
in all your fingers. There are many things

32:43.456 --> 32:47.899
which decode it. Apart from physical
you have got also emotional problems

32:47.924 --> 32:53.173
which can be found out. The left side suggest
the emotional problem and the right side

32:53.198 --> 32:55.698
the physical and the mental problem.

32:55.698 --> 32:58.291
If a person is egoistical,

32:58.296 --> 33:03.489
if his ego is hurt, anyway if there's a problem
with his ego somehow or other

33:03.501 --> 33:09.294
in any way, then you get this
finger catching very much.

33:09.304 --> 33:13.004
But after getting Realisation, you
don't feel bad if somebody says,

33:13.029 --> 33:15.529
“Mother, my Agnya here is catching.”

33:15.582 --> 33:17.678
All right, you say it, you don’t feel bad about it.

33:17.703 --> 33:19.810
You say, "All right, clear it out!"

33:19.835 --> 33:24.260
This centre is that of Christ.

33:24.285 --> 33:26.684
Even many people who call themselves Christians

33:26.709 --> 33:30.713
have the same Agnya as the Jews
have and as the Muslims have.

33:30.738 --> 33:34.700
One because they are unauthorised

33:34.725 --> 33:38.589
that’s why Christ is angry, another
because they are criticising Christ.

33:38.614 --> 33:43.234
Both ways it is just the same.

33:43.272 --> 33:48.207
Christ wants, or anyone of them, they want
that you should realise them,

33:48.232 --> 33:53.407
you should feel them, you should know them.

33:56.777 --> 34:03.076
Today specially for the Sahaja Yogis I
wanted to discuss the right side very much,

34:03.101 --> 34:10.466
because so far, we have not dealt with it very
much. Normally we got people who were

34:10.491 --> 34:13.366
on the left side, on the emotional problem.

34:13.391 --> 34:18.981
The right side is called also as Prana Shakti,

34:19.006 --> 34:23.396
means the vital power of life.

34:23.421 --> 34:27.376
And the left side is called as Mana Shakti.

34:27.404 --> 34:29.837
Now this Prana Shakti,

34:29.862 --> 34:35.083
which is on the right-hand side...

34:35.108 --> 34:37.608
What's happened?

34:39.769 --> 34:42.269
There's some noise somewhere.

34:44.134 --> 34:47.025
The Prana Shakti within us

34:47.041 --> 34:51.786
comes to us through five elements.

34:51.811 --> 34:59.045
The five elements are, as you know,

34:59.070 --> 35:03.735
is, one of them is the earth,

35:03.760 --> 35:05.755
then we have got the water,

35:05.770 --> 35:09.560
then we have got the air,

35:09.579 --> 35:12.079
then we have got the light

35:12.107 --> 35:14.607
and then we have got the ether.

35:14.607 --> 35:17.107
These five elements are there.

35:17.132 --> 35:22.649
Out of these five elements our body is made.

35:22.674 --> 35:32.989
These five elements create five cocoons around
us. And that’s how we have got five auras within us.

35:32.999 --> 35:39.289
These five auras can be
detected by some machines

35:39.293 --> 35:44.009
because these machines are

35:44.009 --> 35:53.379
able to detect only the right side

35:53.379 --> 35:57.229
as they deal with matter.

35:57.254 --> 36:02.157
The whole of the matter is created by these five ey have a

36:02.182 --> 36:07.222
energies and thlso a casual energy behind it.

36:07.247 --> 36:11.151
And these casual energies actually make that.

36:11.170 --> 36:17.533
For example: the causal
energy of earth is fragrance.

36:17.558 --> 36:23.011
From the fragrance earth is created.

36:23.018 --> 36:25.518
Now, within us all these five centres

36:25.518 --> 36:32.452
that you see

36:32.464 --> 36:40.542
these are, these five up to
here, are made of five elements.

36:40.542 --> 36:43.785
The body of those centres are made of

36:43.785 --> 36:47.918
only the body part, I am saying
– of those five elements.

36:47.943 --> 36:57.347
And the Deities residing in those centres
are also born from those five elements.

36:57.347 --> 37:01.547
Because they were born of a particular element,

37:01.560 --> 37:14.312
they concentrated more on that and maintained
the knowledge more limited to that area,

37:14.327 --> 37:17.219
which dealt with that particular element.

37:17.244 --> 37:25.278
For example, we can say the green thing is the
one that represents the water, water element.

37:25.432 --> 37:31.930
This centre in the stomach is
the water element within us.

37:31.935 --> 37:34.975
It is called as Nabhi Chakra

37:34.985 --> 37:38.565
and around it is called as the
Bhavasaghara, you can say the Void

37:38.565 --> 37:40.855
or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say,

37:40.855 --> 37:45.155
the whole world as such, within us.

37:45.177 --> 37:54.200
So the people who were born on
this centre, around this centre,

37:54.225 --> 38:00.591
were born out of water element.

38:00.591 --> 38:07.375
In this Bhavasaghra, Bhavasaghra
means the ocean of this world

38:07.385 --> 38:15.142
were born, through this ocean of the world,
were born all the Primordial Masters

38:15.153 --> 38:17.382
one after another,

38:17.383 --> 38:21.649
we can say Abraham, Moses,

38:21.649 --> 38:28.359
we had Janaka, we had Adi Nath and Socrates

38:28.373 --> 38:31.196
and so many others like that

38:31.221 --> 38:33.721
Nanaka

38:33.746 --> 38:38.255
and also very recently we
had about hundred years back

38:38.342 --> 38:42.569
a very great saint born in India known as Sainath.

38:42.569 --> 38:47.162
They all represent the same
element, that is the water element,

38:47.177 --> 38:49.677
being responsible or being born out of that

38:49.677 --> 39:03.708
they are anxious to maintain water element as the
one which is within us for sustaining ourselves.

39:03.733 --> 39:08.453
We are sustained by water so they
help us to sustain ourselves.

39:08.478 --> 39:13.642
They are the sustainers, they tell us
how to sustain, as a human being.

39:13.667 --> 39:21.439
And all of them have tried to establish religion
within us. A religion doesn’t mean outside,

39:21.464 --> 39:28.135
but the religion as a man, means the capacity
of a man or you can say, the quality of a man.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.660
What a human being should be like,

39:30.685 --> 39:34.343
what is the way to know if
he is a human being or not

39:34.368 --> 39:37.968
which is described in the Ten Commandments.

39:38.750 --> 39:44.288
Now the way they have said it is all
misinterpreted and all wrong things have come.

39:44.313 --> 39:50.173
But one thing is definite, that they have never talked of fanaticism.

39:50.198 --> 39:52.673
They are against fanaticism.

39:52.698 --> 40:00.631
They are against alcoholism, because
alcohol spoils the water element very much.

40:00.918 --> 40:05.864
If you see the effect of alcohol on
water in the

40:05.889 --> 40:09.313
blood of human beings you will be amazed

40:09.338 --> 40:13.140
how the neutral position of hydrogen
and oxygen or OH ion

40:13.165 --> 40:16.974
is absolutely imbalanced by alcohol.

40:16.974 --> 40:19.673
And water cannot absorb any heat from the liver,

40:19.673 --> 40:22.173
which sorts out all your poisons.

40:22.183 --> 40:25.849
And that's how people get bad livers and bad troubles

40:25.849 --> 40:30.428
and then people would say, "What's wrong?"

40:30.428 --> 40:33.919
There is nothing wrong as such,
because even nothing wrong in that.

40:33.919 --> 40:39.658
“What’s wrong according to the theory
of wrong and right of human beings,

40:39.668 --> 40:42.888
I think nothing is wrong. You can kill
yourself. You can jump from anything.

40:42.910 --> 40:46.581
You can do whatever you like.

40:46.581 --> 40:50.611
There is nothing wrong. If you break this, if you
break that, if you break anybody, do anything,

40:50.631 --> 40:55.551
there is nothing wrong what’s wrong with it?

40:55.566 --> 40:59.742
But there is fundamentally wrong is
that you are created for a purpose.

40:59.767 --> 41:02.126
You have not created yourself.

41:02.151 --> 41:05.487
God has created you with such difficulties.

41:05.512 --> 41:09.698
He has taken you out of

41:09.723 --> 41:13.004
so many evolutionary processes
and brought you to this stage

41:13.029 --> 41:18.861
and now you have no business to
kill yourself and destroy yourself.

41:18.886 --> 41:22.624
This is wrong is that you are destroying
yourself, you are destroying your community

41:22.649 --> 41:26.899
you are destroying others or
you are destroying yourself.

41:27.058 --> 41:32.788
If you are destroying yourself also because
you are on your own, you think, "What’s wrong?"

41:32.788 --> 41:36.063
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

41:36.088 --> 41:41.648
You are a cell in the whole and
being created to know the whole

41:41.673 --> 41:44.963
and if you destroy yourself you
are destroying the whole as well.

41:44.988 --> 41:51.011
You become malignant. You become cancerous

41:51.158 --> 41:53.658
and that’s why it’s all wrong.

41:53.658 --> 41:59.909
In anyway if you destroy others or destroy
yourself you have no right to do that.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.807
God has given you freedom, no doubt.

42:02.814 --> 42:07.577
By creating ego and superego within
yourself with these activities,

42:07.577 --> 42:09.775
you become separated from the whole.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.950
And then you think you are Mr Such and Such.

42:12.975 --> 42:18.315
And then you stand and say, “I
believe in this, and I believe in...,"

42:18.348 --> 42:22.758
actually who are you? You are made by God.

42:22.768 --> 42:25.268
You are His own child.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.571
Still you are a child.

42:27.578 --> 42:32.341
It's like a baby saying, "I believe in it, I believe in it."

42:34.325 --> 42:36.689
You have not known the whole so far.

42:36.691 --> 42:39.939
How can you say that?

42:39.951 --> 42:43.449
You have to grow!

42:43.461 --> 42:46.816
And when you grow, your
freedom is complete,

42:46.818 --> 42:49.318
absolute.

42:49.318 --> 42:56.746
But the ideas about this freedom are such
that you are fighting your own innocence

42:56.756 --> 43:00.586
you are fighting your own sustenance.

43:00.596 --> 43:08.872
And this sustenance was completely supported

43:08.892 --> 43:17.148
protected by these great
incarnations of Primordial Masters.

43:17.173 --> 43:21.016
That’s why they talked against alcohol.

43:21.031 --> 43:26.651
Christ did not talk about alcohol, all
right – because He was at another point,

43:26.651 --> 43:30.371
but He did not say that you take alcohol, never.

43:30.391 --> 43:32.271
People said that He drank wine

43:32.271 --> 43:35.681
but wine means grape juice in that country,

43:35.681 --> 43:38.181
it doesn’t mean alcohol.

43:41.211 --> 43:44.621
How can Christ say, you drink wine,

43:44.635 --> 43:46.781
which is fermented,

43:46.784 --> 43:48.731
which will go against your awareness?

43:48.731 --> 43:50.964
Just think of it!

43:50.991 --> 43:54.036
It goes against your awareness, isn’t it?

43:54.061 --> 43:56.054
Your awareness is to be enlightened,

43:56.079 --> 43:58.869
He came on this earth to enlighten that awareness,

43:58.894 --> 44:03.722
do you think He will say that you get foggy with it?

44:03.747 --> 44:08.260
Does it not fog your attention and your awareness,

44:08.310 --> 44:10.810
is a fact.

44:10.810 --> 44:16.515
But He wants to do something else

44:16.540 --> 44:22.486
because He came as Divine Power itself.

44:22.567 --> 44:25.067
He was the embodiment of Pranava

44:25.067 --> 44:30.550
not Prana – all powers put together.

44:30.575 --> 44:36.067
He was the embodiment of OM itself, the Brahma.

44:36.079 --> 44:39.327
That’s why He came to prove

44:39.337 --> 44:41.799
what Krishna has said,

44:41.799 --> 44:45.039
that it cannot be killed by anyone.

44:45.052 --> 44:47.459
It cannot be blown off,

44:47.462 --> 44:50.747
it cannot be destroyed.

44:50.772 --> 44:54.032
His body was made out of that,

44:54.052 --> 44:59.532
and that’s why He could be resurrected.

45:03.882 --> 45:05.491
All these things are knowledgeable

45:05.491 --> 45:07.062
only if you are a realised soul,

45:07.062 --> 45:10.682
otherwise you cannot understand this.

45:10.682 --> 45:13.992
Because you have not yet gone into the depth

45:14.022 --> 45:15.682
of your own understanding,

45:15.702 --> 45:18.957
you are still children as I say,

45:18.982 --> 45:21.937
you have to be born again,

45:21.962 --> 45:29.336
and then you can find out for these vibrations.

45:29.361 --> 45:33.248
You have to ask just a question,

45:33.248 --> 45:41.947
“Was Christ embodied with Pranava,

45:41.972 --> 45:45.008
or the OM, or the Brahma?

45:45.033 --> 45:49.617
Or was He made of Brahma itself?”

45:49.702 --> 45:54.312
You will get the cool breeze.

45:54.312 --> 45:59.642
and that is the sign that He was.

45:59.644 --> 46:06.954
It is much deeper but the whole
knowledge exists as experience to you.

46:06.954 --> 46:11.699
The whole of it, it is an experience within us.

46:11.724 --> 46:15.584
And one has to get that experience of oneself,

46:15.609 --> 46:18.342
which is knowledge itself

46:18.359 --> 46:22.407
and then everything trickles down

46:22.432 --> 46:27.583
just like actual thing within us,
as we see white as white and red as red.

46:27.608 --> 46:33.938
Animals do not see perhaps,
but human beings do see.

46:34.075 --> 46:41.555
Thus, our awareness is enlightened.

46:41.565 --> 46:47.435
I will be talking to other Sahaja Yogis in
the Ashram about the right side later on

46:47.458 --> 46:51.495
because we have new people, and
they are to be looked after.

46:51.533 --> 46:59.750
And I think, next time when I
meet, I don’t know when, maybe...

46:59.775 --> 47:06.555
No, in the Ashram firstly. Thursday evening I think, then
I'll talk to you because Friday I've got to fly out.

47:06.596 --> 47:09.795
Thursday evening I will
be there most probably.

47:12.624 --> 47:17.434
So just now, let’s have the
experience for the new ones,

47:17.439 --> 47:22.614
and for the others also to deepen themselves.
May God bless you.

47:25.599 --> 47:29.269
All of you should put your
hands just like this, before Me,

47:29.280 --> 47:35.209
and close your eyes, just close your eyes!

47:35.209 --> 47:40.498
Put the hands like this, you
see and just close your eyes.

47:40.512 --> 47:44.732
You have to close your eyes because
the Kundalini, when She rises

47:44.757 --> 47:47.334
on the Agnya Chakra

47:47.359 --> 47:49.613
the dilatation of the pupil takes place

47:49.638 --> 47:53.224
and if your eyes are open the dilatation doesn’t take place.

47:53.249 --> 47:59.489
When people mesmerize they keep your eyes
open, because they put you on the sides.

47:59.499 --> 48:05.059
I will tell one day how they mesmerise, also.

48:07.723 --> 48:12.785
First you will feel that there is no thought
in your mind, if you watch your thoughts.

48:12.810 --> 48:20.050
Then the Kundalini rises about
Agnya, you get Thoughtless Awareness.

48:21.363 --> 48:28.174
When it pierces the fontenel bone area, I mean
when you get your baptism by your Kundalini,

48:28.199 --> 48:36.517
then you feel the kind of a cool
breeze coming towards you from me;

48:36.526 --> 48:46.596
or a kind of a radiation of cool breeze
coming. From all over you might feel it.

48:51.907 --> 48:57.968
On your hands! Through
your fingers! It works!

49:01.598 --> 49:04.108
All of you should put your
hands towards me. Please!

49:05.648 --> 49:08.148
That's important.

49:13.103 --> 49:20.789
I mean even to put your hands is hard to
request, that means how egotistical you are.

49:20.794 --> 49:27.532
You've come here for getting your Realisation
and don't even want to put your hands towards me.

49:27.553 --> 49:32.988
All such people should leave.

49:33.008 --> 49:37.213
Getting cool breeze?
Great!

49:37.213 --> 49:39.311
Close you eyes and enjoy yourself.

49:39.313 --> 49:44.101
Best is to enjoy, this is the greatest
moment you've been waiting for.

49:44.109 --> 49:48.859
Close you eyes!
Enjoy yourself!
