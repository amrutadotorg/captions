00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:22.710
[Music]

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.300
collectivity doesn't mean that we all

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.589
should be stuck together with some glue

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:39.500
or something or we all become like

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:44.539
Gibraltar no it doesn't mean it means

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.660
wherever you are you are connected that

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.190
is collected but if you are not

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.379
connected and you are just glued

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.710
together it's very inconvenient to live

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.359
under such circumstances I think people

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.489
don't even understand the meaning of

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:09.950
collectivity where there's not the other

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:17.020
anon now there's not the other there's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:20.810
no other personality these personalities

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:26.560
are separated from you because of left

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.560
and right or could be both

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:38.110
but you are yourself fully when you are

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:43.350
absolutely detached and your Kundalini

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.350
is dancing you are alone and never alone

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:59.700
this oneness with the whole gives you

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:06.420
all the security that you want all the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:10.789
joy you want and that's why Kundalini

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.789
awakening means collectivity

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.190
unless and until you want pure

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.790
collectivity in your being

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:30.230
Kundalini won't rise

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:39.240
[Music]

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:44.850
so now let us see how do we miss out on

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:50.850
collecting it's a very practical

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.070
down-to-earth understanding first we

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.530
must know without collectivity we cannot

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:03.090
exist as the body has to be in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.700
connection with a brain in the same way

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:13.350
without collectivity sahaja yoga cannot

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:16.160
exist once you understand that then you

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.019
have to work it out that collectivity is

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.900
absolutely established within and

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:27.959
without I do not know what thing comes

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.620
first in the human mind about another

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:38.239
person but the first thing is that these

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:43.320
are your real relations and nobody else

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:48.570
are your relations these children are

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.489
your children and these men are your

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.760
brothers and these ladies are your

00:03:50.489 --> 00:04:00.570
sisters and we are one big family

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:06.060
together we are part and parcel of one

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.900
body as this hand cannot hit another

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.370
hand thank God it doesn't think

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.450
otherwise as human beings they might

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.669
start thinking against another hand but

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.269
they don't because they are connected to

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:28.740
one brain activity

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:33.580
[Music]

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:38.020
so you can see that when we ascend in

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:44.380
the collective consciousness and we have

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:46.419
collective living collective meeting at

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.870
the wish of the chakra Shri Krishna

00:04:46.419 --> 00:05:02.200
established this all he manifested this

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:09.250
pure relationship of a sister in a

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:12.430
collective life that we have in the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.450
ashram where we live where we move about

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:22.630
at sahaja Yogi's if we do not have this

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:25.740
basic principle within us there will be

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.130
a can of chaos complete loss

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:34.300
once this purity of relationship is

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:38.669
established that apart from my wife all

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.669
the rest are my sisters or mothers

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.580
it cannot be

00:05:50.969 --> 00:06:04.139
a proper society and the chaos of the

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:10.949
social system of America is because they

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:12.659
have no sense of pure relationships once

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:16.469
you call somebody a sister she's a

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:21.659
sister and once you call somebody a

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:23.189
brother she's a brother it's not only

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.029
that you should be born of the same

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:32.099
parents it's not necessary but this is a

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:36.029
very important principle to have a very

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:38.299
pure society where every caddy can live

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.299
peacefully

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:51.329
[Music]

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:54.779
think of the tree which is say in a

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:59.149
turmoil or during earthquake it won't

00:06:54.779 --> 00:07:02.939
grow when the earthquake stops

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:06.059
everything becomes quiet everything is

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:08.249
peaceful then only the tree can grow in

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:10.769
the same way our growth can only take

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:16.409
place if we are peaceful within

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:19.649
ourselves so for a Kundalini growing

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:20.249
wider and wider and rising higher and

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:23.009
higher

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:27.869
first thing is we must have peace within

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:31.679
ourselves but this peace is possible if

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:34.199
you can make ready peace with others if

00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:37.559
you cannot make peace with others who

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:40.709
are in sahaja yoga who are in the

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:44.159
collective if you are in a turmoil this

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:47.149
Kundalini can never rise that is why

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:50.069
collectivity is so important

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:54.479
without collectivity usually cannot

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:57.389
offer and without connectivity you

00:07:54.479 --> 00:08:01.739
cannot have the growth of your

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:04.319
spirituality if the growth of the

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:08.399
spirituality as they say the Tree of

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:11.879
Life is upside down and the roots are in

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:17.969
the brain and this Kundalini has to go

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:20.909
and water that brain as we bottle the

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:25.549
roots then it starts flowing downward

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:25.549
and that's how we start expanding

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:34.930
[Music]

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:37.089
now mother has said we have to have

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.130
compassion when away do you have our

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:42.159
compassion on the walls where do we use

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:45.670
our compassion where do we use our

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:47.410
compassion so Sergio guys to be

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.770
practiced doesn't mean that you sit down

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:53.279
with my photograph all the time doesn't

00:08:50.770 --> 00:09:01.540
mean that it means you practice

00:08:53.279 --> 00:09:03.760
compassion you practice that then you

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.850
have to practice love now how do you

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.880
practice love with others if you love

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:15.880
someone what do you do you try to please

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:18.279
that was small things can make people

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.650
very happy I know you all try to please

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:22.420
me very much and give me presents you'll

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.089
find out things which are good for me

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.550
you go out of the way bye sweet flowers

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:31.930
for me beautiful things you do to please

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:36.250
me I am over priest I am sorry but I am

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:38.709
more pleased much more pleased if you

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:41.950
understand collectivity and try to

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:45.459
please each other so now the practice

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:50.320
love where you practice I ask you a

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:55.089
question where do I practice love what

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.790
do I love believe love our house we love

00:09:55.089 --> 00:10:01.270
our photographs of decorations

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:07.390
everything but do I practice this love

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:10.020
on my wife or my husband or another

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.020
sahaja Yogi's

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:20.520
[Music]

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:28.680
in our search culture we have to

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:33.450
practice compassion and love and thirdly

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:35.940
we have to practice patience I know some

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.510
children are maybe little more

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.490
mischievous some are less mischievous

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.410
maybe some people are very talkative

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.510
sometimes really they gave me also a

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.590
headache

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:50.550
they go on talking talking talking

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:54.530
talking so much sometimes I think it's

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.530
good because it's a rest for my mouth

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.880
one way of looking at it another way of

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.590
looking of it is just switch off your

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:06.150
mind let him talk take it out whatever

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:10.910
you want once he is finished with it in

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:13.500
fact out then he won't bother you much

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:17.160
and also it feels satisfied that

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:19.620
somebody has listened to his practice so

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:24.570
patience is needed and patience is

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:27.720
needed in such a way that others should

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.610
see your patience yesterday for example

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.680
I was sitting for about I think three

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:37.650
hours shaking hands with all sorts of

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:40.860
people and all types of problems and the

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:45.290
person who came last he said looking at

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.290
your patience I develop my own patience

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:56.760
and love gives you patience this love

00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:01.020
nourishes you I am Telling You it

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.880
substituted down-to-earth method here I

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:06.140
have not mentioned that you trust God

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.370
I'm just saying trust yourself

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.540
absolutely down to earth because we are

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.540
talking about your brain

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:23.749
[Music]

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:27.589
so today's understanding should be that

00:12:23.749 --> 00:12:29.079
we all should become collective from

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:33.670
itself

00:12:29.079 --> 00:12:38.689
we should not grudge or grumble about

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:42.079
and enjoy the collectivity but the

00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:45.230
second sight of collectivity is this

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:47.360
that do not try to exploit the

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.209
collectivity otherwise we'll be in

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.449
trouble like I've seen some people don't

00:12:50.209 --> 00:12:58.579
know how to use their bathrooms when you

00:12:53.449 --> 00:13:04.429
are collective you have to be respecting

00:12:58.579 --> 00:13:07.189
the collectivity of others by your

00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:12.619
presence another person should not by

00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:21.110
any chance suffer or should not feel in

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:26.209
any way insulted or inconvenient

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:27.970
inconvenienced so when you are in the

00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:31.749
collective it should be such that

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:38.179
another person should enjoy your company

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:47.629
enjoy your being there that's something

00:13:38.179 --> 00:13:49.790
where there is no problem but if you are

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:52.370
demanding and if you are asking for

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:55.429
things and you think no end of yourself

00:13:52.370 --> 00:14:01.399
you cannot collect you by any chance but

00:13:55.429 --> 00:14:06.769
you will suffer for them automatically

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:12.999
you'll suffer if this is realized and

00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:12.999
understood properly your are guess all

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:30.259
[Music]

00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:37.790
like anger people always boast I'm very

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:42.110
angry with you boast but just make that

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:44.619
anger into forgiveness and you see the

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:49.399
person you serve you getting into

00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:51.489
problems he will get into problems anger

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:55.029
will upset you

00:14:51.489 --> 00:14:57.100
but forgiveness will upset him

00:14:55.029 --> 00:15:00.439
automatically

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:04.309
it's the biggest weapon you have God is

00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:10.730
to forgive and this is shown in buddha's

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:13.299
character throughout now we have been

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:18.499
saying that we have to forgive everyone

00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:21.829
but we don't practice that small small

00:15:18.499 --> 00:15:23.720
things like mad people we remember only

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:26.329
only I ever had heard that snake has

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.939
this capacity to remember if somebody

00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:31.119
has hurt him but here I find human

00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:34.100
beings have no less combatants

00:15:31.119 --> 00:15:35.869
whatever has happened 13 years back 15

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.540
years back they all remember each and

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:40.699
everything whatever has hurt them but

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.670
how they have hurt others they don't

00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:46.970
remember how they have been nasty to

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:52.069
others they are no no because this is a

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:53.600
human mind which has got the ego it can

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:57.949
go on hurting others it doesn't feel

00:15:53.600 --> 00:16:00.049
anything and the super-ego which goes on

00:15:57.949 --> 00:16:03.069
receiving all the hurts and always pray

00:16:00.049 --> 00:16:03.069
complaining about

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:14.559
[Music]

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:17.529
don't criticize the collectivity till I

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:22.949
myself find it out and I'll put it right

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:25.689
keep to the collectivity wisely and

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:32.230
arresting and try to keep the

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:34.779
collectivity together try to help to

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.410
keep the people collective to enjoy

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:39.639
together

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:42.129
don't criticize each other only

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:44.439
criticize yourself if you lie if you are

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:47.199
in the habit of criticism better

00:16:44.439 --> 00:16:50.829
criticize yourself is better because

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:53.019
these are habits also people especially

00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:55.660
I have seen people in the West they

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:58.389
react to everything if they see this

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.249
cover-up I don't like it but this is not

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:01.929
yours you are not paid for you what have

00:17:00.249 --> 00:17:04.740
you got to do with it now I don't like

00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:07.089
it it's not yours

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:10.419
what's the question it's lying here and

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:14.730
why should you be so upset what I don't

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:24.519
like that person I don't like that dress

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:25.299
who are you I don't like this is not

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:32.950
allowed inside

00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:35.769
I don't like there is the way of saying

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:39.029
things but there is no need to say

00:17:35.769 --> 00:17:39.029
anything whatsoever

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:52.150
so all of these kind of bumptious nests

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:52.150
and showing off is against collectivity

00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:02.860
[Music]

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:04.760
so try to appreciate everything

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:10.490
children are producing pictures

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:13.400
paintings enemy they make sometimes my

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.659
face is very funny when they draw not

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.480
the children even grown-ups

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:20.690
then what I appreciate is very good

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.950
wonderful very nice to encourage that

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:26.809
person so criticism should go out of our

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:31.549
mind but appreciation should be

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:36.380
practiced appreciation of others

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:38.780
children appreciation of other people is

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:42.250
very important but that doesn't mean

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.419
that you appreciate all others and

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.289
torture your wife or tortured your

00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:51.140
husband that also is an environment

00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:54.830
first responsibility is your family but

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:57.260
you should appreciate others and this

00:18:54.830 --> 00:19:00.559
comes when you have no jealousies about

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.280
anyone this jealousy I don't know from

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:03.830
where it comes

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:08.419
I don't know this quality of jealousy

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:10.640
why there is jealousy so also if you

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:13.640
have jealousy you have to use it for the

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.919
right purpose and what is the right

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.140
purpose is that you should be jealous of

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:21.260
a person who is spiritually higher than

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:24.409
you and you practice it that you become

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:27.200
better if jealousy is for competition

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:32.020
then you compete with a person who is

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:38.630
more compassionate more loving more

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:40.760
sacrificing more patient so this

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.820
competition becomes a very healthy

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.570
competition and the collectivity becomes

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.570
very nourished

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:58.049
[Music]

00:19:54.210 --> 00:20:01.419
the worst enemy of collectivities

00:19:58.049 --> 00:20:04.480
aggressiveness some people are basically

00:20:01.419 --> 00:20:07.359
addressing their style of talking is

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.970
extremely aggressive the way they say

00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:13.470
things is ex aggressive maybe because

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:16.090
anything maybe they are better educated

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:20.080
maybe they come from a very aggressive

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:24.249
family maybe they are are having a kind

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.669
of air superiority complex or an inside

00:20:24.249 --> 00:20:31.509
or too complex or a sense of insecurity

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:34.590
or maybe they are possessed they try to

00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:41.759
dominate and show their very strong

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:44.950
feelings towards people of superiority

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:49.179
they may be inferior it's not necessary

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:52.830
but they took and this is something is

00:20:49.179 --> 00:20:58.679
to be curved so what you have to

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:58.679
practice here is humility try to be able

00:20:58.889 --> 00:21:06.519
humility is that in no way you try to

00:21:04.239 --> 00:21:09.970
address others and if others are

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:12.669
aggressive you accept it as a childish

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:16.720
thing as a stupid thing as a foolish

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:20.799
thing has no meaning because you are so

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:23.169
powerful you can bear it that is

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:30.070
humility which you have to practice and

00:21:23.169 --> 00:21:33.340
all these qualities if you have you will

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:36.059
really be surprised that you would lose

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.059
your selfishness

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:47.150
[Music]

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:50.630
only way to grow is to be collective

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:54.200
there's no other way out if people think

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:56.720
that by staying away from ashrams alone

00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:01.540
living somewhere they will achieve much

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.540
that's not the way sahaja Yoga is meant

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:10.040
formerly people used to go to Himalayas

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:13.670
and most of them were separate it and

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:17.660
only one or two persons were chosen for

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:21.400
spiritual growth here it is not question

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:26.660
of spiritual growth is the question of

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:29.870
your collectivity growing in you that is

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:34.070
how you become a person who is

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:36.920
collective who enjoys collective who

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:42.590
works on collective and lives with

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:52.660
collective such a person develops new

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:55.970
kind of powers and these powers are such

00:22:52.660 --> 00:23:02.960
that they are very subtle but they

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:06.830
penetrate into any molecule atom or

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:10.250
human beings anywhere and their

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:13.750
penetration is only possible if you have

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:16.700
a temperament which is collective

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:23.990
without being fully collective you

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:28.059
cannot achieve that height which is very

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.059
necessary today for sahaja yoga

[Music]

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:52.990
integration is not there that's why you

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.580
have to attend collective you know you

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:57.130
have to become more collective the body

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.990
has to be collective the thing is if you

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.030
don't if you are not a collective person

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.620
then sometimes you'll kill them on the

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.870
leg sometimes on the heart sometimes in

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.700
the head that's not a good thing you

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.070
should try to become more collective

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:13.600
should meet more people take more

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:17.620
interest you see the body of yours won't

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:23.020
work out efficiently unless and until

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:27.250
you use it because individually you see

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:31.510
if they individually if you work up it

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:34.090
will not develop collectively because

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:37.120
where are you using it you are

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:39.160
correcting yourself to give it to others

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.730
and if you don't give it if you do not

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:45.660
work it out in a collective way there's

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.660
no circulation

00:24:53.650 --> 00:25:01.190
meditating together is the best way to

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:02.750
feed the connectivity you can meditate

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.060
at home of course you are suppressing

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.130
for your depth but also you must

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:11.710
meditate together and when you meditate

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:14.930
together then the strength that you have

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:17.440
strengthens others and the strength of

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:20.390
the whole collectivity improves so much

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:24.080
we are meditating together is a very big

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:26.660
thing everyone has to understand that

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.640
whenever you get time you find out in

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.580
the morning times for example we'll go

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.740
to the ashram and meditate say Sunday

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.960
morning will just want me to take in the

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.870
ashram just for meditation you have to

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:42.860
come meditate and go away because I

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:45.610
reside in this ashram I'm here so leave

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:48.770
your homes come here and meditate

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:52.460
meditation will help you a lot wherever

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:54.920
you are together and with it but when

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:59.510
you are away from each other I am NOT

00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:01.760
with you only in difficulties when you

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.760
are pushed into some places where I am

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:09.110
not that where you think I'm not there I

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:11.900
am there but if you deliberately are

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:14.150
keeping out of collectivity and not with

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:17.150
you so try to grow your collectivity

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:21.110
otherwise you cannot go deep into your

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:24.830
own depths you cannot become a great

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:27.770
sahaja yogi you cannot really be called

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:32.110
as such those who have a sense of

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:32.110
collectivity can only become that

collectivity I surrender myself to the

collected so here in complete awareness

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.590

if you are mesmerized then you can do

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:05.850
whatever way you like but in complete

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:12.950
awareness and full understanding we have

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:15.570
to become collective but once you are

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:20.250
without ego means you have surrendered

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:22.730
yourself no one can cheat you can you

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.730
understand that

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:34.850
no one can cheat you because there is

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:38.580
some higher force which is looking after

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:43.590

dissolved when you say mother is

you give this horrible ego a complete

00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:55.099
I am working on are in a collective way

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:58.219
held by me my Murata the quality of

00:28:55.099 --> 00:29:02.960
Virata gana is that that she creates

00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:10.369
this universal awareness within us the

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:13.700
collectivity and if you do not realize

00:29:10.369 --> 00:29:19.450
that in modern times we are in a

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:19.450
spiritual part in a collective way only

00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:30.159
this is what it is because we have

00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:35.210
reached to the state of Salaam and here

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:40.219
we have to have a collective working

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:43.009
only there's no other way out this is

00:29:40.219 --> 00:29:48.169
the most important point we must know if

00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:50.659
he cannot be collective because of

00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:52.849
anything jealousy maybe inferiority

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:55.159
complex maybe any anything which is

00:29:52.849 --> 00:29:58.789
coming from behind like a worm crawling

00:29:55.159 --> 00:30:00.320
up then know that something wrong with

00:29:58.789 --> 00:30:05.719
you nothing wrong with the collectivity

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:10.159
I hope you can understand my vision and

00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:14.299
in stand by me come up to that I depend

00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:15.950
on you entirely for my vision we have to

00:30:14.299 --> 00:30:20.599
change this whole world into a beautiful

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:22.940
place for that not my sacrifice is

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:26.119
needed they are already blessed you

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:33.070

00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:33.070
your attention on the source of power

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:46.870

00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:46.870
