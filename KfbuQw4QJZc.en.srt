1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,830
So this principle of Shri Krishna

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,350
is so important that at the state,

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,550
as you call it the Vishuddhi chakra

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,470
we become complete,

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,190
in the sense that when the Sahasrara is opened out for you

6
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:31,550
and you start feeling the vibrations,

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,110
you are not yet fully complete.

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,990
If you were just complete then it would have been

9
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,950
an end of your evolution,

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,650
because at that stage, if you had finished it,

11
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,210
then there was no need to have Sahaja Yoga.

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,190
But actually it means that once the Sahasrara is opened out,

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,750
then you have to come down to your Vishuddhi chakra,

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,630
that means to your collective.

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,310
If it is not working on your Vishuddhi chakra,

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,950
the enlightenment on Vishuddhi chakra,

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,870
you cannot feel the vibrations.

18
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,669
As you saw yesterday,

19
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:24,230
the artists started playing in a very new dimension.

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,750
It's not that only they got awakening of the Kundalini.

21
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,030
The awakening of the Kundalini was there, no doubt,

22
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,870
but it had to come down to their Vishuddhi chakra.

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,150
If I could not have brought it back to their Vishuddhi chakra,

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,670
their hands could not have moved that fast,

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,590
they would have never felt the sweetness,

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,910
the madhurya of Shri Krishna,

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,990
and they would not have manifested it.

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,710
So all that is expressed through your fingers and hands

29
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,171
achieves that new awareness of creating the madhurya,

30
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,830
the sweetness.

31
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,310
In your art, in your music,

32
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,470
in your gestures,

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,510
in every way, your hands are very important.

34
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,910
But Vishuddhi chakra also plays part, as you know,

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,670
on the sixteen chakras or the sub-plexuses

36
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,150
which look after our face,

37
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,103
our ears, nose, eyes, neck,

38
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,830
all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra.

39
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,310
As a result also, you can become great actors,

40
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,245
you can have eyes which are innocent,

41
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:45,670
you can have a skin which is shining,

42
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,390
you can have ears which can hear the Divine music,

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,590
you can have a nose which shows your dignity.

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:05,830
In the same way, your whole facial expression changes.

45
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,030
If you are a very harsh person

46
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,670
and a hot-tempered person

47
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,030
and you have harshness on your face,

48
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,110
or else if you are like a beggar all the time,

49
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,110
or you are crying all the time, weeping,

50
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,190
your face looks so miserable,

51
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,230
everything changes and comes into the center,

52
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,190
where you look beautiful, you look attractive,

53
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,510
in the Divine way, and also you get

54
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,830
a very sweet countenance.

55
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,789
Also the teeth and the tongue

56
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,670
are looked after by the Vishuddhi chakra.

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,750
So your teeth which are in trouble get cured.

58
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,757
You sometimes, as I told you

59
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:57,230
I have never been to a dentist all my life.

60
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,830
So you can imagine that you don't have to go to the dentist any more

61
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,230
if you have your Vishuddhi chakra all right.

62
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,390
Then also your tongue improves.

63
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,910
For example some people are very sarcastic by temperament.

64
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,550
They cannot say something sweetly,

65
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,230
all the time they are sarcastic, saying sarcastic things.

66
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,510
Some people have a habit of abusive language.

67
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:28,669
Some people are extremely beggarish type,

68
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:31,470
all the time talking in a very beggarish manner.

69
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,510
There's no dignity, there's no sweetness

70
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,750
and there is no self-confidence for some people.

71
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,750
Some people even stammer,

72
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,230
some people cannot stand on the stage and give a lecture.

73
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,950
All these things drop out

74
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,077
as soon as your Vishuddhi chakra improves.

75
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:52,590
This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation

76
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,590
of the Vishuddhi chakra's improvement within yourself,

77
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,023
through the awakening of Shri Krishna on Vishuddhi chakra.

78
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:08,908
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness.

79
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:13,070
You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing,

80
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,590
all that is troubling you, all that is a problem,

81
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,910
you just start watching it,

82
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,070
you start witnessing it, you start seeing it,

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,829
and you do not get disturbed.

84
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,470
That seeing, that witnessing state

85
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,989
has a tremendous power.

86
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,910
Whatever you see without thinking,

87
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,150
your problems get solved.

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,910
Any problem you have, once you get this witness state

89
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,670
- what you call 'tatasth'-

90
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,190
means you are standing on the shores

91
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,070
and so watching the waves to move -

92
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,830
then you know how to solve the problems.

93
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,790
So your witness state has to be developed

94
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,510
and sometimes I have seen,

95
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,030
people have to go through little difficulties

96
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,510
to develop that witness state.

97
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,397
This is very important that once the Kundalini starts

98
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:11,670
supplying you from your Sahasrara downward,

99
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,470
moving on your chakras

100
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,310
and enriching your different chakras,

101
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,230
on the Vishuddhi chakra

102
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,510
when it has to stay, it really tries to

103
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,590
little bit take you through turmoils

104
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,230
and you start thinking that, "See now, my life was so blissful.

105
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,830
I had so many blessings and now what has happened?"

106
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,830
But this is the time when you should become tatastha,

107
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,924
means you should become a witness.

108
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:46,238
If you become a witness everything improves.

109
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:54,270
For example you are say a person who is working in some place.

110
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,630
As soon as you become a witness, you see,

111
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,870
your attention goes inside

112
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,710
and you start watching things from inside out.

113
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,470
As a result you see exactly what's wrong, where,

114
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,150
and as you have got the power of witnessing,

115
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,781
with that power you get over the problems that you have.

116
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:17,630
Problems get solved very easily

117
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,917
if you know how to witness the whole situation

118
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,870
than to get involved into it.

119
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,710
And this is the best state which you call as Sakshiswarupatva,

120
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,390
which you achieve when the Kundalini comes up

121
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,790
and the connection is established

122
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,790
and the Divine ray starts flowing through that

123
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,830
and enriches your Vishuddhi chakra.

124
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,870
Now the name of Shri Krishna has come from the word 'krishi'

125
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,790
meaning 'the ploughing',

126
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,190
'ploughing' of the soil

127
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,230
for planting the crops.

128
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,670
Now He is the one who has done the ploughing for us,

129
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,805
in the sense that He has created us in such a manner

130
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:20,030
that when the sprouting has to be done

131
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,790
you are already ready for it.

132
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,918
But as it is we human beings spoil our Vishuddhi chakra

133
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:32,790
by many wrong things, as you have seen that

134
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,029
we smoke or we take drugs,

135
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:38,590
or we take tobaccos and all that.

136
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,005
So our Vishuddhi chakra goes out.

137
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:45,750
On top of that, if you are a person who doesn't talk at all

138
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,070
or who talks too much or who shouts and screams

139
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,870
and who shows temper, raises his voices,

140
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,470
also spoils his Vishuddhi chakra.

141
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,470
So the first thing is that in your

142
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,390
using the Vishuddhi chakra, you have to remember

143
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,917
it is to be used for sweetness, for madhurya.

144
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:12,270
If you want to say something to someone,

145
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,390
try to say something that is sweet and nice,

146
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,118
practice it.

147
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:21,751
In certain places I have seen

148
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,390
that people are used to a kind of a talk

149
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,590
and sometimes they cannot talk in the fashion that is sweet.

150
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,630
For them it is adharma as if to talk sweetly to someone.

151
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,709
They only believe that you must really talk in a manner

152
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,590
that will hurt others.

153
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,550
So hurting anybody is not in the dharma of Shri Krishna.
