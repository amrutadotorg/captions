1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,286
So you reach a state

2
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:11,401
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

3
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:14,703
means ‘without’,

4
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,078
without.

5
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:27,474
So such a person

6
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:32,065
is without thought; he doesn't think.

7
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:42,928
Such a person is without greed,

8
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:48,441
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

9
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:56,670
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

10
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:06,177
out of which nothing is left out.

11
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:10,404
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

12
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:14,345
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

13
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:19,147
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

14
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:23,072
because it reaches a point all the time

15
00:01:23,273 --> 00:01:27,892
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

16
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:31,796
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

17
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:37,955
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

18
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:46,678
Vacuum of all the negative,

19
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:53,548
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

20
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:04,204
Such a person is eternal being.

21
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:09,004
Nobody can kill,

22
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:15,079
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

23
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:22,050
The anger

24
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:28,116
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

25
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:32,245
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

26
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:44,338
He is not elated by praises

27
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:50,383
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

28
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:54,669
the boons of the ego.

29
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:12,836
So the third state where he reaches,

30
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:18,741
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

31
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,827
Nihi.

32
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:28,950
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

33
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:34,877
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

34
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:38,765
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

35
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:42,374
But the word is 'Nihi'.

36
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:46,129
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

37
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:51,247
‘nih’ -

38
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:57,567
that means

39
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,424
‘sheer’.

40
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:12,134
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

41
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:21,839
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,274
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

43
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:42,475
Like when you say

44
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:50,516
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

45
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:53,131
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

46
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:58,621
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

47
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:05,447
But this word is used,

48
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:08,790
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

49
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:17,759
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

50
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,921
without or devoid of.

51
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:29,631
The another form is:

52
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:33,277
the only - absolute;

53
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,104
the absolute.

54
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:45,937
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

55
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,806
nothing but joy.

56
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:51,983
It's complete freedom.

57
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:56,320
So you have all kinds of joys,

58
00:05:56,521 --> 00:06:02,749
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

59
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,770
the joy of the Spirit.

60
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:14,941
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

61
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:19,173
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

62
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:24,147
where you have the joy of the play.

63
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:31,374
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

64
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,247
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

65
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:38,479
means, sheer absolute joy.

66
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:43,894
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

67
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:47,373
it means absolute.

68
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:50,555
So when you put such an adjective before

69
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:54,446
anything else it becomes absolute.

70
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,549
Thus you become absolute.

71
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:18,466
And when you are at that state of absolute

72
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:24,877
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

73
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,550
But let us see what is absolute.

74
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:45,055
That means it is not relative;

75
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,610
it has no relative qualities.

76
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:52,961
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

77
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:55,872
it cannot be compared.

78
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:01,726
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

79
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:08,354
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

80
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:12,089
anything else through which we can comprehend;

81
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,969
it is absolute.

82
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:25,206
Whatever way you try to know it

83
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:29,617
you go away from absolute.

84
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,525
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

85
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:56,256
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

86
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:01,818
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

87
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,157
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

88
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:10,811
means the anand of the body,

89
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:19,506
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

90
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,336
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

91
00:09:26,537 --> 00:09:30,927
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

92
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,279
But the state has now

93
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,466
to be established within us is of Niranand.

94
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:46,192
Then what is the question of fear?

95
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,884
What is the question of talking about it?

96
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:56,969
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

97
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,654
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

98
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:06,385
There are no words for absolute to describe.

99
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:09,205
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

100
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:12,773
what remains is absolute.

101
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:20,561
So you reach the state of absolute.

102
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,092
And that is the state

103
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:31,250
a complete communication is established

104
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:36,187
and in that communication you have nobody else

105
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:39,661
but the absolute within you.

106
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:50,475
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

107
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:55,849
That is the level to which you should aspire.

108
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:02,626
That should be the ascent,

109
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:07,358
which should be established within ourselves.

110
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,909
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

111
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,528
we don't have to do anything drastic.

112
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:20,190
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

113
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:24,312
the only, ‘kevalam’.

114
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:34,402
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

115
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:43,563
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

116
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:49,756
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

117
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:55,095
Just by surrendering you become.

118
00:11:56,657 --> 00:12:00,597
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

119
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:07,962
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

120
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:12,652
It is absolute love,

121
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:16,353
it is absolute compassion;

122
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:20,384
it is absolute power.

123
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,808
The words stop,

124
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,384
the description stops;

125
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:45,372
you just become the absolute

126
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:52,419
and feel your absoluteness through it

127
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,010
with that oneness.

128
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:02,916
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

129
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,685
There’s no company needed.

130
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:14,089
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

131
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:26,561
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

132
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:33,097
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

133
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:40,840
May God bless you.
