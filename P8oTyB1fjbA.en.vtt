00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.240
Today, we are doing a special type of puja

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.160
which is performed in the glory of Ekadesha Rudra.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.320
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of the Spirit.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.960
Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiveness.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.160
He forgives, because we are human beings, we commit mistakes,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.560
we do wrong things, we get tempted,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.400
our attention is disturbed – so he forgives us.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.960
He also forgives us when we spoil our chastity,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.120
we do immoral things,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.162
we do thieving, and we do things

00:02:34.282 --> 00:02:38.441
that are against God, talk against Him.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.340
He also forgives our superficialities,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.121
jealousies, our lust, our anger.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.080
Also He forgives our attachments, petty jealousies,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.480
vanities and also possessiveness.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.080
He forgives our egoistical behaviour

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.440
and also our subordination to wrong things.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.871
But every action has a reaction, and when He forgives,

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:07.560
He thinks that He has given you a big grace-mark,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.680
and that reaction builds up within Him

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:23.640
as a wrath, against those who are forgiven,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.160
try to do greater mistakes.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.960
Specially, after realisation,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.960
because such a big blessing there is of the realisation,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.287
you’ve got the light and, in the light

00:04:56.407 --> 00:04:59.280
if you are holding onto a snake

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.080
then His wrath goes up because he sees how stupid you have been.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.760
What I am saying is that after realisation, specially,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.280
He is much more sensitive

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.800
that, people who are forgiven

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.480
and have been given such a big thing like Self-realisation,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.520
still they do wrong things then he is much more wrathful.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.625
So, in the balance, the forgiveness starts reducing

00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:57.062
and the wrathfulness starts increasing.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.840
But when He forgives and, as a result of that forgiveness

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.200
you feel the gratitude,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.480
then His blessings start flowing towards you.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.760
He gives you tremendous capacity to forgive others.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.976
He pacifies your anger, He pacifies your lust,

00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:52.848
He pacifies your greed.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.840
Like beautiful dew drop His blessings come on our being

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.280
and we become really beautiful flowers,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:37.400
and we start shining in the sunshine of His blessings.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.920
Now He uses His wrath or His destructive power

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.160
to destroy all that tries to trouble us.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:16.680
He protects realised souls at every point, in every way.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:27.000
Negative forces try to attack a sahaja yogi

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.600
but they are all neutralised by His tremendous power of protection.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.360
Through his vibratory awareness we are guided into right path.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.680
All the beautiful blessings of His are described in the Psalm 23

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.800
isn’t it, that’s the 23 Psalm ……

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.520
The Lord is my Shepherd”

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.480
Is all described how he looks after you like a shepherd.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.600
But He does not look after the evil people

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.400
He destroys them.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.640
Those who enter into Sahaja Yoga [and] are

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.160
still carrying on with their evil nature are destroyed.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.520
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.560
and do not rise He destroys,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.520
or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.720
Those who murmur against God and live in a way

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.440
that is not behoving a sahaja yogi, He removes them from [it].

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.560
So by one force, He protects, by another force, He throws away.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.200
But His destructive forces when they are built up too much,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:51.800
then we call it : "Now the Ekadesha Rudra is active."

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.960
Now, this Ekadesha Rudra will be expressed

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.720
when the Kalki itself will start acting,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.160
means the destructive power which will destroy all

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.880
that is negative on this earth and save all that is positive.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.640
So it is very necessary for sahaja yogis

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.720
to expedite their ascent,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.240
not to be satisfied with the social life or married life

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.120
or with all the blessings that God has bestowed upon you.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.560
We always see, what God has done for us,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.920
how He has been miraculous to us,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.600
but we have to see what we have done to ourselves,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.800
what are we doing about our own ascent and growth.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.600
Now the…out of the eleven centres…… Ekadesha, means eleven,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:53.640
the five come from the right side of your void,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.080
and five from the left side of your void.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.040
The first five on the left hand side come from:

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.760
if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.800
or if you have read wrong books,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.680
or if you have been in the company of wrong people,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.960
or if you have been sympathetic towards people

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.120
who have been following wrong paths,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.560
or you have been yourself one of the agents

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.960
or guru of these wrong people.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:25.120
Now these five problems can be solved, if we completely give up

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.960
whatever wrong we have been doing.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.360
As Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to beat the Shaitan,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.920
-means the Satan- with shoes;

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.960
but that has to be done not mechanically but from your heart.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.640
Like many people who come to Sahaja Yoga will tell me,

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.080
“My father is following this guru; that father is following that guru,”

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.840
and get involved with their father, sister, this, that

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:24.960
and try to take them out from those gurus, also get entangled.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:46.760
Or some of them yield to others’ forces.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.560
Like I know of Maureen, who was with me,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.640
and her parents and parents-in-law said

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.568
said must be baptised, and I told her

00:15:57.688 --> 00:16:01.640
you cannot get this child baptised because it’s a realised soul.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.040
But she could not, that way, stand up to that,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.400
and she took the child for baptism

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:23.640
and the child became very funny – it was really like a mad child.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:49.400
Now then she gave up all that and so she has saved.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.120
But supposing she had another child

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.160
and she would have done the same thing, the second child

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.520
would have been something very, very bad.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.120
Now, the trouble with sahaja yogis is that

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.520
anybody who comes to Sahaja Yoga programme

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.120
thinks he is a sahaja yogi – is not so.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.920
Either you should have very strong sensitivity,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.520
or you should feel it in your body,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.200
or with your intelligence you should understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.230
A person who is still negative always gets attracted

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.470
towards other one who is a very, very powerfully negative

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.440
and does not understand

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.880
that the other person is so powerfully negative,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.360
but gets impressed.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.640
Under such circumstances, such a person is hit

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.640
by that negative person

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.000
and Shiva cannot protect.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.440
One should not have sympathy with anyone who is negative,

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.960
whether he is mad,

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.760
whether there is something wrong with him, whether he is your relation,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.840
or anything. No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary a kind

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.120
of a anger should be there for that person,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.800
a kind of a detachment, angry detachment.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.080
And this angry detachment is the only time

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.280
when you have to be angry.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.800
But I have seen people who have anger for very good sahaja yogis

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.480
but not for their own husbands or wives who are extremely negative.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:25.080
So when the Ekadesha Rudra starts acting on these five sides

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.920
on the, we should say, on the right side it moves, because

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.800
it comes from the left and moves to the right side,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:42.400
then a person starts becoming negative but acting with his ego.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.360
Such a person may take up a situation into hands and say that

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.920
“I am such and such sahaja yogi and I am so, we should do like this

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.760
and we should behave like this”, and start dictating people.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.480
[They] can do anything.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.960
And some mediocres or some half baked sahaja yogis

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.760
may try to understand [him],

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.840
but most will know that “This fellow is going out,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.440
now he’s on his way out!”

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:02.560
So, all these things lead to this left side development,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:08.520
or we can call it on the head, on the right hand side of your medha,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.480
this plate, brain-plate

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.200
is called as medha in Sanskrit language.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.040
Now, the right sided one, comes from the idea people have that,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.520
“I am myself a big guru.”

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.560
They start preaching about Sahaja Yoga also, as if

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.440
they have become great gurus.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160
We have known some people who give big lectures

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.400
in any programme and never allow my tape to be played or anything.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.000
They think they have now become experts.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.960
Then some of them say that now we have become so great

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.040
that we need not do any footsoaking or anything,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.920
there’s no need to do meditation – there are some like that also.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.600
And then there are some who say that

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.040
"sin can never touch us, now we are sahaja yogis,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.480
we are very great evolved souls".

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.320
But the worst of all are those who just take my name

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.040
saying that “Mother has said so

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.520
and I am telling you because Mother has said”

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.400
– when I have never said such a thing, is all falsehood.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.320
Now there are some people who use Sahaja Yoga money

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.440
and exploit Sahaja Yoga in such a way,

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.400
exploit them, sahaja yogis also sometimes.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.520
And such people become very inauspicious.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.760
Anyone who tries such things

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.960
will go out of Sahaja Yoga with disgrace.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.480
But one should never go near such a person,

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.360
have nothing to do with such a person, have no sympathies.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.640
Because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone to any extent,

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.440
so better keep out of such people.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.560
When these ten Ekadeshas are developed within a person,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.840
then definitely such a person gets diseases like cancer

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.880
and incurable horrible diseases.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.160
Specially, when the eleventh one which is actually here,

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.960
which is the Viratas chakra,

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.680
which is the collectivity, when it is affected as well,

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.680
then such a person cannot get out of this disease.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.760
But these…out of these even five are combined,

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:03.160
supposing, with Mooladhara or with Agnya,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.080
then they get into very serious type of dirty diseases.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.600
That’s why, I always say that be careful about your Agnya chakra,

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.760
because that is one of the worst things,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:42.600
that, once it starts getting combined with these Ekadeshas,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.600
part of the Ekadeshas, then anything can happen to a person,

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.960
he can meet with a horrible accident,

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.480
he can suddenly be hit by someone, could be murdered by someone,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.840
anything can happen to such a person who has got the right Agnya

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.040
and also any one of the Ekadeshas, right or left.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:31.520
That means, the five of these, if they, any one of the five,

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.560
if they combine with Agnya Chakra,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.400
the protective powers of God are minimum.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.240
So, to keep your Agnya chakra alright,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.320
say now I am speaking, now you should watch Me constantly,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.600
so that there is thoughtless awareness

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.960
and the Agnya chakra is soothed out.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.960
But, don’t pay attention here and there all the time.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.480
Then you will find that, gradually, your attention will neutralise

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.600
into thoughtless awareness,

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:44.520
and your attention would be fixed in such a manner

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.240
that you don’t have to worry about anything.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.440
In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch you, that is your fortress.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.840
By meditation, one must establish thoughtless awareness,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.160
that is the sign that you are rising higher.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.560
Many people do meditation and say, “Alright, Mother we are doing.”

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.880
Mechanically, they do and say,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.760
“Yes, I did this, I did this, and I did this!”

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.960
But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness, minimum of minimum?

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.600
Have you felt your cool breeze coming out of your head?

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.960
Otherwise, if you are doing something mechanically,

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.600
it is not going to help; help you or help anyone.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.520
So, after realisation, as you are very well protected,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.600
you have all the blessings and a great future,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.842
you also have a great

00:31:28.962 --> 00:31:36.402
possibility of a complete annihilation.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.480
I would say, to give an analogy, you are climbing,

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.600
and everybody is supporting you to climb, holding your hand,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.280
and there are so many things by which you are protected,

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.480
to be taken upward,

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.840
there’s no possibility of falling off by mistake also,

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:19.560
but if you try to remove your bondages with Truth and Love

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.120
and all the time try to hit the people who are trying to support you,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:31.080
then you fall from a great height, greater height.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.640
I mean, the greater height you rise, the greater you fall,

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.040
and with a greater force also, much more deeper.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.040
But every effort is made by the Divine,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:28.600
every support is given to you, every care is taken.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.600
Despite that, if you want to fall,

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.800
then from that height, is very dangerous.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.800
But Ekadesha Rudra, at that time, at such a time when somebody tries

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.840
to harm the cause of Sahaja Yoga, after being in Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:07.280
then hits you so badly that the whole attack is very widespread.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.000
But the whole family can be protected if there are few people

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.200
of that family doing Sahaja Yoga work; could be protected.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.400
But in case the family that is

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.520
against all the time of sahaja yogis and try to trouble them,

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.200
can be completely destroyed, in a very bad way.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.000
Now these Ekadesha Rudras come out of, as I told you, from the Void.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.400
So, we can say that the destruction part of it

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.760
comes from the Void mainly.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.680
But these are the powers, all are given in one person

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.080
that is the Mahavishnu, that is Lord Jesus Christ.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.880
Because He’s the support of the whole Universe,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.600
He’s the personification of Omkara,

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.000
he’s the Personification of vibrations.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:16.960
So when He gets angry then the whole Universe starts breaking.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.080
As He personifies the power of the Mother

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.280
which is penetrating into every atom, into every molecule,

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.320
and to every human being,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.880
into every [thing] that is living and non-living:

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.520
once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets into a jeopardy.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:25.960
So the pleasing of Christ is very important.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.840
Now Christ has said, “You have to be like small children”

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.960
That is, the innocence, the purity of the heart

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.360
is the best way you can please Him.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.960
As in the West, specially, people

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.800
have developed their brains too much,

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:04.080
they try to play about with words

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.880
and think that nobody knows what they are doing.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:33.880
All such people must know that everything you do is known to God.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.560
If you are not clean in heart,

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:50.120
it is very dangerous for anybody to pose

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.560
as if he’s a very good sahaja yogi.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.360
Such people are not possessed, nor they are conditioned,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:18.280
nor they are egoistical, but they are very cunning clever people

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.880
and they are quite aware, as to what they are doing.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.920
But, there are people who get possessed also

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.280
and then they, in that , they try to destroy themselves

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.720
or cry and weep and do all kinds of things.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.120
There are some who think that if they hurt themselves

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.440
or do some sort of an extreme thing

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.360
then God will be happy -are sadly mistaken.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.640
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.280
then you should know that something is wrong with you.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.520
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga, then you must know

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.200
that there’s something definitely wrong with you.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.400
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja yogis,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.560
then be sure something is wrong with you.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:07.040
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness of God,

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.880
then something wrong with you.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.840
If you are still worried about negative people and their problems

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.240
then know that there’s something wrong with you.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.200
If you have sympathies with negative people,

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.200
then also there’s something wrong with you.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.920
But if you have anger for negative and all that is negative

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:56.880
that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are there.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.200
When this thing gets matured then you become the power

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.000
of Ekadesha Rudra yourself.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.000
Anybody who will try to insult you

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.920
or to do any harm, will collapse.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.200
It has happened with many people who tried to be insulting to Me

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.160
or tried to harm Me or anyway….

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.000
Sometimes I am quite worried about them.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:15.360
So one has to be in such a way that they become the Ekadesha.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.160
Nobody can touch such people.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:34.120
But such a person is full of compassion and forgiveness.

00:43:38.848 --> 00:43:44.048
As a result, Ekadesha acts much faster.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:54.280
The more compassionate you are the more powerful Ekadesha becomes.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:07.840
The more collective you become, the more Ekadesha acts.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:17.440
Many people have a habit of receding back into their exclusion

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.048
and saying “Oh we better be at home and it’s alright,”

00:44:22.168 --> 00:44:25.088
but they don’t know what they are missing.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.480
Whatever may be your experience with others,

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.520
you should stick-on together,

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.002
always attend programmes, take leadership, go ahead with it,

00:44:46.122 --> 00:44:50.562
work it out and you will be blessed thousand-fold.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.600
Ekadesha Rudra are all the powers,

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.400
I would say, of destruction, together.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.960
Is the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:33.080
It is destructive power of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.360
It is the destructive power of the Mother.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.720
Is the destructive power of the Ganesha…

00:45:55.287 --> 00:46:06.607
and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumana, Kartikeya and Ganesha.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:26.920
Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:33.760
All the destructive powers of all the incarnations are Ekadeshas.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.800
Now the last but not the least,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.800
is the destructive power of Hiranyagarbha

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.680
which is the Collective Brahmadeva.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:16.400
And this power when it acts, every atom explodes,

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:22.880
the whole atomic energy goes into a destructive power.

00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:37.382
So, thus, the complete total destructive power is Ekadesha Rudra.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.520
It’s extremely powerful, explosive, but it’s not blind.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:01.200
It’s very discriminative and extremely delicately woven.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:12.160
It avoids all the good points and attacks the wrong things

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:30.208
and it hits at the right time, at the right point,

00:48:30.328 --> 00:48:37.328
direct, without hitting anything that is good in between.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.480
Now the glance of Ekadesha Rudra falls upon someone,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.400
say, for example, and there is something in between which is divine

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.680
or which is a positive thing

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.007
[then] it penetrates through positive, without harming the positive

00:49:04.127 --> 00:49:06.327
and hits the negative.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:26.165
It cools down somebody and burns another.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:44.367
Not freezing, it doesn’t freeze, it cools down.

00:49:50.562 --> 00:49:55.779
So that is how it works with such care and such delicacy.

00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:05.346
And it is tremendously sharp also.

00:50:07.935 --> 00:50:10.118
And it’s very painful.

00:50:12.068 --> 00:50:15.283
It’s not like cutting the neck in one shot,

00:50:15.403 --> 00:50:19.570
it goes on slowly, slowly. All the horrible tortures

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:22.482
that you have learnt or heard about

00:50:22.602 --> 00:50:27.163
are expressions of Ekadesha only.

00:50:45.926 --> 00:50:49.750
For example, take the case of cancer.

00:50:52.402 --> 00:50:57.152
In the cancer thing, the nose is removed,

00:50:57.272 --> 00:51:00.644
the tongues are removed, then the gullet is removed,

00:51:00.764 --> 00:51:04.088
then everything goes on, one after, one after,

00:51:04.208 --> 00:51:07.840
being removed with terrible pain, you see.

00:51:20.266 --> 00:51:24.820
Take leprosy for example, the lepers cannot feel their fingers,

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.796
they cannot feel it, so the…any rat or anything eats their fingers

00:51:28.916 --> 00:51:32.476
they can’t feel it, so they start losing their fingers,

00:51:41.933 --> 00:51:48.228
that is how Ekadesha eats up people, devours.

00:51:54.547 --> 00:51:58.064
But this wrathfulness of the Father

00:51:58.184 --> 00:52:03.840
can be very gentle and could be very sweet,

00:52:08.149 --> 00:52:11.775
when it comes to His own children.

00:52:17.865 --> 00:52:22.622
The story is about the Mother

00:52:22.742 --> 00:52:25.966
– once She got very angry, the Primordial Mother.

00:52:26.086 --> 00:52:29.357
And She was so angry, She wanted to destroy the whole world

00:52:29.477 --> 00:52:32.205
with Her Ekadesha power and She tried to destroy the whole world.

00:52:33.628 --> 00:52:38.462
When She went into that mood, the Father Himself felt

00:52:38.582 --> 00:52:43.875
that She is being [a] bit too much angry.

00:53:06.645 --> 00:53:12.110
So when She started destroying, and She was going right and left,

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:16.667
He did not know what to do, so He took Her child,

00:53:16.787 --> 00:53:22.177
that means representing sahaja yogi, you can say, representing Christ

00:53:22.297 --> 00:53:26.717
or representing anyone of these great children of Her’s,

00:53:26.837 --> 00:53:30.549
that he put the child under Her feet.

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:09.685
So, when She was stamping, suddenly She saw Her own child

00:54:09.805 --> 00:54:12.404
under Her feet  and Her such a big tongue came out.

00:54:12.524 --> 00:54:17.364
She just stopped. Balancing.

00:54:31.315 --> 00:54:35.472
But this has happened only once.

00:54:39.321 --> 00:54:42.766
So, after the Ekadesha Rudra, ultimately

00:54:42.886 --> 00:54:50.226
the complete destruction comes through the anger of Sadashiva.

00:55:02.595 --> 00:55:07.322
When the final total destruction takes place.

00:55:12.528 --> 00:55:16.893
So thus we have seen how Ekadesha Rudra acts

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:23.071
and how sahaja yogis have to become themselves Ekadesha Rudra.

00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:34.639
Now to develop this power

00:55:34.759 --> 00:55:45.019
one has to develop a tremendous power of

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:52.569
detachment, power of detachment,

00:56:00.373 --> 00:56:02.808
detachment from negative.

00:56:05.577 --> 00:56:09.108
For example, negativity can come from very near people,

00:56:09.228 --> 00:56:13.000
like brother, mother, sister, could come from friends,

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.350
could come from relatives.

00:56:25.123 --> 00:56:29.400
It could come from a country, it could come from

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.210
your political ideas, economic ideas, anything like that.

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:40.340
Any misidentification can destroy your power of Ekadesha Rudra.

00:56:56.931 --> 00:56:59.850
So it is not only sufficient to say that “I am surrendered

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.519
to Sahaja Yoga and I am a sahaja yogi,”

00:57:02.639 --> 00:57:06.707
but you must know mentally also what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:19.425 --> 00:57:24.123
So that, intelligently, you understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:29.047 --> 00:57:33.150
Because in the West specially people are over-intelligent and if

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:38.298
the light of Sahaja Yoga does not enter into their intelligence

00:57:38.418 --> 00:57:44.353
you can never overcome your attachments.

00:58:00.245 --> 00:58:03.732
That doesn’t mean you talk too much about Sahaja Yoga or

00:58:03.852 --> 00:58:06.479
you give lectures on that, but mentally

00:58:06.599 --> 00:58:09.361
you should also understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:20.219 --> 00:58:24.053
Today is a special day when it has been asked that

00:58:24.173 --> 00:58:26.972
we should have Ekadesha Rudra puja,

00:58:27.092 --> 00:58:36.413
and is for all kinds of false religious sects and false gurus

00:58:36.533 --> 00:58:43.216
and false religions, which are followed in the name of God,

00:59:02.914 --> 00:59:10.173
or any religion that does not say about Self-realisation

00:59:10.293 --> 00:59:13.231
and does not achieve Self-realisation

00:59:13.351 --> 00:59:18.406
and does not get connected with God, is false.

00:59:33.986 --> 00:59:39.755
So any such thing that is just faith and talks of God

00:59:39.875 --> 00:59:41.934
but has no connection with God

00:59:42.054 --> 00:59:45.131
cannot be a true religion.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.612
Of course, it gives a balance to people,

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:06.887
but in giving that balance, if people live on that money

01:00:07.007 --> 01:00:10.755
and try to enjoy

01:00:15.319 --> 01:00:17.987
a wealth out of that money,

01:00:18.107 --> 01:00:24.912
then it is not even at the very lower level is religion.

01:00:25.032 --> 01:00:29.277
Like a balance, you, see, religion has to give a balance to begin with,

01:00:29.397 --> 01:00:32.582
but in that balancing when they tell, “You have to be balanced,

01:00:32.702 --> 01:00:36.084
but give me money for that, you must give me money,

01:00:36.204 --> 01:00:39.106
give me all your purse, give me everything,”

01:00:39.226 --> 01:00:41.292
then that cannot be balanced,

01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:48.500
it does not even have a slightest thing of the blessings of God.

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:11.758
Or any religion that makes you bow

01:01:11.878 --> 01:01:15.292
to anybody else but the incarnation, is no religion.

01:01:15.412 --> 01:01:19.137
That’s another one which is absolutely false.

01:01:30.913 --> 01:01:34.969
The real religion will give you a balance

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:38.861
and will always talk about the ascent.

01:01:48.055 --> 01:01:51.572
But they will not ask for money or make one man

01:01:51.692 --> 01:01:55.678
something great as venerated.

01:02:05.953 --> 01:02:10.879
Thus, we should learn to discriminate between

01:02:10.999 --> 01:02:16.384
falsehood, negative things and real things.

01:02:25.652 --> 01:02:29.513
Once you develop that discrimination through vibratory awareness,

01:02:29.633 --> 01:02:36.986
or through your intelligence, you are in the control of yourself.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:58.162
And then you become that power of Ekadesha,

01:03:01.396 --> 01:03:05.427
when you establish your maturity.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:14.164
Today, I bless you all, that you all become

01:03:14.474 --> 01:03:18.422
the power of Ekadesha Rudra

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:25.703
and you develop that sincerity which takes you to that state.

01:03:29.726 --> 01:03:32.006
May God Bless you.
