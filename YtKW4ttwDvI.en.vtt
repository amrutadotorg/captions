00:00:23.253 --> 00:00:28.255
Shri Mataji: Is it for the loudspeaker?
Yes.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.594
We can wait for some time more to organize.

00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:53.625
It is so unfortunate that it was not
published in the newspaper properly,

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:58.699
that day – it’s very unfortunate.

00:01:35.473 --> 00:01:38.261
Yogi: Excuse me Mother, I think to get
this microphone a little closer to you.

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:41.175
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogi: Do You want to get
this a little closer to You?

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:43.893
Shri Mataji: I’ll have it in My hand.
Yogi: You’ll take this in Your hand?

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:47.014
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Yogi: Okay.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.268
Shri Mataji: Then that won’t slip out,
you know. Yogi: Ah, okay.

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:06.042
That’s ok, this. This is the one…

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.815
When we say in the newspaper or
in an advertisement

00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:10.280
that you come to such and such hall
for your Self-realization,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.839
I don’t know what people think about it.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:24.799
Perhaps they think that it is another
hocus-pocus

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.978
or some sort of a cult or some
money-making proposition.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.707
But there are some who may not think
that way,

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:51.280
but they want to have their Self-realization
and they come here.

00:04:52.046 --> 00:05:00.759
But one must understand that the attitude
we should have towards our Self

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:09.239
has to be really very earnest. To raise
your Kundalini is not so difficult

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.608
and to give you so-called realization
also not difficult,

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.604
in the sense that you can feel the cool
breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:29.160
coming out of the fontanel bone area,
you can get your baptism.

00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:34.118
But I call it "so-called"

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:41.271
because the journey later is the difficult
thing, you see.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:50.482
If the attitude is not earnest, then you
just lose it in no time.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:59.079
So where the people are very ego-oriented -
I should say, convex personality is there -

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.734
it is even difficult to give realization
to begin with,

00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:08.056
and even if you give realization,
to maintain it

00:06:08.257 --> 00:06:14.153
and to make them grow is even more
difficult, much more difficult.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.735
Now sometimes Sahaja Yogis ask Me,
“Mother, how is it that in India

00:06:18.936 --> 00:06:22.839
You may give realization to thousands
and they all stick on,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.920
while here when You give realization
to people

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.720
they just come and go away, are all wasted
as described

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.317
in the parable of Christ of the seeds, that
some seeds just were lost on the rocks?”

00:06:40.518 --> 00:06:43.119
So why it happens here?

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.441
I would not blame them, but I would say
that they have had no knowledge

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:56.873
what Self-realization is, how difficult
it is.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.559
If you read Patanjali’s “Yogashastra”
you’ll be surprised

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:11.519
how they were taught how to lead a good,
righteous life after marriage;

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.653
what was the relationship of a husband
and wife;

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:23.714
what was rhythm of sex life; how they
should treat their children;

00:07:23.915 --> 00:07:29.319
how to develop their attention towards God
every day.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.839
All these things are absolutely missing
from the lives of people

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.871
who have turned their backs to God.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.650
Now, whatever you may try to turn
your backs to God or to your Self,

00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:54.999
to your Spirit, it exists and it asserts
its own existence in you. It does.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.028
Even if you try to defy it and deny it,
it comes up,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.039
and so people are seeking and seeking.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.879
The tragedy of the whole thing is that very
great seekers are born in the West

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.173
where people have no knowledge what is
Self-realization

00:08:16.374 --> 00:08:22.759
and what one has to do to achieve it and
what a great blessing it is to have it.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.455
This is the biggest problem we face
all over and now as I am going to America

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:31.369
I also dread the same problem there.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:37.959
Now the thing is, people have full idea
as to the value of a diamond.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.479
They know if the diamond weighs so many
carats, it means this.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.799
If it is flawless, it means this. If it is
purest blue then it means this.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.559
But they don’t know the value of their
spiritual life;

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.320
they don’t know what it is to be spiritual.
Under these circumstances, naturally,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.719
what happens that when even they get
Self-realization

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.559
they cannot stick on to Sahaja Yoga and
go further with it.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.079
Not that they lack in quality. I would say
it is not so.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.800
I would not say that they are the people
who are good for nothing,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.193
they are not good for spiritual life.
So all the Sahaja Yogis must have

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:27.439
a very compassionate and understanding
attitude towards them,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.719
that when they come to you they have
no knowledge about it.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.000
They are not trained that way. They are
not taught that way.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.152
I wish the people in the countries where
they have lost themselves

00:09:40.353 --> 00:09:45.880
in the material gains should again read
some of these books into details

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.239
and try to find out what kind of life human
beings were supposed to lead

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.399
and what kind of life we are leading now.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.759
Now the word there is yama niyama, is a word
in the Patanjali Shastra, yama and niyama.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.879
The niyama are the rules for yourself,
what rules you have to observe.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.639
And what rules you have to observe
for others is yama,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.256
where - how to deal with others, what
should be your relationship

00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:19.560
to your wife, to your children, to other
relations that are there,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.440
and how you must respect particular things

00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:26.688
and to prepare yourself for
Self-realization, the ascent.

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:31.662
All this balance has to be there if you
have to ascend in life.

00:10:31.863 --> 00:10:36.738
Even to lead a proper good life you have
to be like that.

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:40.710
I tell you, if you go to India you’ll find
the country

00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:46.720
hasn’t got any sanitation whatsoever,
hasn’t got all the food that you have,

00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:51.760
hasn’t got any of your railways or any one
of these your telephones as they are.

00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:54.763
And when I go to India I forget that
there are telephones existing.

00:10:54.964 --> 00:11:01.239
They never use this for Me there. Everything
that is so dislocated, mismanaged,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.323
all kinds of funny things are there.
Sometimes there is a drought.

00:11:04.524 --> 00:11:08.051
Sometimes there is a flood. All these
things are there.

00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:14.104
Despite that, people are existing only
because they know

00:11:14.305 --> 00:11:21.759
how to lead a proper life, to adjust
themselves to natural things.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.848
Now the new disease that has come up
in America, AIDS,

00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:32.760
has really upset Me very much. And I know
that it was to come, because today,

00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:37.066
according to predictions it is not Kali
Yuga anymore, it is Kruta Yuga.

00:11:37.267 --> 00:11:40.039
Is the time when things will happen,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.271
Kruta Yuga means when the spiritual powers
will work out.

00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:48.666
This is the time is already - you know that
in our books it is written

00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:54.320
that the Kruta Yuga has started about sixty
years back, and that is how it is,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.214
that now the spiritual powers are going
to react.

00:11:58.415 --> 00:12:01.988
It’s easy to say, “What’s wrong? Who is
God? We don’t believe in God.”

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.986
You’ll have to pay for that.

00:12:05.187 --> 00:12:09.559
If you go against the nature you’ll have
to pay for it.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.119
If you do things according to your own ego,
you’ll have to pay for it.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.126
This is the time that has come. This is
for our good.

00:12:18.327 --> 00:12:20.666
This is not for our bad,

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:24.504
because it has been told many-a-times
not to do certain things.

00:12:24.705 --> 00:12:28.200
Of course, in the Western countries where
Christianity is followed

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.119
is precisely told not to do this, not to do
that.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.239
But then people say, “Why they have
said it?”

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.475
The only difference is that in the East
it is explained

00:12:38.676 --> 00:12:42.239
why not to do this, why not to do that,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.520
what happens. It has gone into the details
of it.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.999
But I must say here also people know that
this is not to be done.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.003
But when you talk about these things,
“This is not to be done”,

00:12:54.204 --> 00:12:57.196
they will brand you as Victorian, or
they’ll mock at you,

00:12:57.397 --> 00:12:59.760
laugh at you, make fun of you.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.479
But when they face all these things
happening to you,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.537
then they don’t know where to go, what
to do and how to face up to it.

00:13:10.738 --> 00:13:16.000
This is the time where the spiritual powers
are going to work out;

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.679
they are going to prove the existence
of God.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:25.240
They are going to prove the existence
of Divine laws and their operation.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.159
They are going to prove all that is said
in all the religions,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.679
their unity, and their integration.
Everything is going to be proved now today.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.919
Even if you say this many-a-times,
many people will not pay any heed to it.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.448
They will say, “Oh, Mother is just
brainwashing us.”

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:46.119
That’s what people told Me when I came
first to England.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.879
That I said, “This is not the life human
beings should lead.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.472
Even for animals it is not suitable.
How can you dare into these things

00:13:54.673 --> 00:13:59.879
and get involved into problems? Later on
it will be showing results.”

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.119
But nobody was willing to listen to Me at
that time and everybody was angry with Me.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.865
They said, “This woman is matronly.”
There are certain words in English

00:14:09.066 --> 00:14:13.599
which are very condemning. Like first
one of them is Victorian.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.313
If you are Victorian you are a gone case,
absolutely,

00:14:16.514 --> 00:14:19.319
that you are branded on; then you
can’t talk.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.780
But I would say even Victorian was better,
where there was some hypocrisy I agree.

00:14:24.981 --> 00:14:29.346
Hypocrisy is a bad thing. But shamelessness
is much worse.

00:14:29.547 --> 00:14:37.383
If you become shameless the thing spreads
like fire. There is no protection.

00:14:37.584 --> 00:14:41.759
Hypocrisy is at least a little protection
from the spreading of it.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.840
And everybody today thinks what’s wrong
in it,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.274
and I, when I came here, I had such
a shock.

00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:54.280
I couldn’t believe that human beings could
go to that extent to ruin themselves.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.879
This is ruinous, absolutely ruinous it is.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.319
And when a person like Christ, who was
nothing but purity, said

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.759
that, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes”;

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.585
to that extent, to that subtle extent
of purity He talked -

00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:16.483
I was amazed how people have denied Him
completely and how all other people

00:15:16.684 --> 00:15:23.070
like Jews, like even Hindus here,
Christians, every sort of people

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:30.236
didn’t think what they were professing,
what they were claiming and what they were.

00:15:30.437 --> 00:15:36.399
Today again, one-by-one you will see
more results of wrongdoings to yourself.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.279
This is because you have crossed
all the limits of niyamas,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.460
how you should be to yourself. Everyone
seems to be sick today,

00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:48.622
either mentally or physically. Why?

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:52.160
Why are they mentally sick there? This is
the physical side of it.

00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:58.044
The mental side is, they can run into
any sort of thing like witchcraft,

00:15:58.245 --> 00:16:02.799
like spiritualism, like any guru who comes
and talks about God,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.458
without finding out the credibility of it,
without finding out

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:09.800
what others have achieved by it.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.279
Not only that, but I have seen people
after being harmed very much,

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:20.359
who have been tortured by these gurus,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.851
who have been completely made beggars
by these gurus,

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:31.383
still profess, still fight for those gurus,

00:16:31.788 --> 00:16:38.119
as if they have lost all their freedom,
all their independence to fight it back.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.879
The other day one lady came to tell Me

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.439
that she went to a relation’s place to stay
with her,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.509
and the relation was so funny that she
wouldn’t even give them full food to eat,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.960
and in the house there was limited food,
and she would lock up everything

00:16:58.121 --> 00:17:02.025
and they really starved themselves, you
see. But she – I knew her very well –

00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:05.387
so she telephoned to Me. I said, “You come
along to My house,” and just called her

00:17:05.588 --> 00:17:10.504
and I was amazed why these things happened
in the life of that woman.

00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:15.480
How could she do it? She had no conscience!
Somebody starving next door to her.

00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:20.036
The reason was she was a drunkard.
She used to drink a lot.

00:17:20.237 --> 00:17:26.696
Her husband used to drink. Now with the
amount of money they earn you cannot drink.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.839
Is a simple thing, leave alone all
the other side of it.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.319
And she was drinking, her husband was
also drinking.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.833
And they, whatever money they have,
they don’t eat much, they just drink,

00:17:39.034 --> 00:17:41.160
and they were waiting for this woman
to disappear.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.047
Because once you become enslaved to one
particular madness like this,

00:17:46.248 --> 00:17:50.678
like drinking or anything, then you forget
all your relationships

00:17:50.879 --> 00:17:53.805
with all your other duties that you have
to perform.

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:58.132
It’s like one madman, you see, doing work
like mad,

00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:01.599
has no consideration of relationships

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.760
or any duties that he has to perform
with others.

00:18:05.939 --> 00:18:11.370
Then also he has no time to think about
the duties towards himself.

00:18:11.571 --> 00:18:16.519
He becomes such a dry personality that
he has no conscience even.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:23.079
And he just shuts up his mind from all
that is gracious,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.627
all that is sublime, all that is compassion.
He is just busy with himself.

00:18:28.828 --> 00:18:31.880
He wants to drink. He wants to drink,
that’s all.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.457
Very seriously he’ll say, “Yes, I have
to drink now. I like it”.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:41.080
So it doesn’t matter if his dog doesn’t get
the food

00:18:41.262 --> 00:18:45.879
or if his children have to starve or if
they have to work on the streets.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.360
He doesn’t mind because he has to drink.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.079
Then there is another thing, like today
I saw so many people enjoying cricket –

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.221
I Myself can enjoy cricket very well and I
understand cricket very well.

00:18:59.422 --> 00:19:06.672
But how much time do they pay to themselves
in the sense they are just enjoying

00:19:06.873 --> 00:19:15.400
what is something entertaining. But what
about the entertainment of your Spirit?

00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:21.830
Have you thought of your Spirit at all?
Have you ever peeped into yourself

00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:26.840
and found out that there is Spirit, which
has to be satisfied and entertained?

00:19:27.013 --> 00:19:30.344
And once you entertain that Spirit you
don’t need any entertainment.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:33.239
If you have it, well and good, if you don’t
have it, well and good.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.440
That is the highest type of entertainment.
That’s the highest type of enjoyment.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.870
That’s the highest life that one can
ask for.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.680
So all these things come to a level where,
“What’s wrong?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.429
What’s wrong in this and what’s wrong
in that?”

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:56.349
So the nature is now going to show you
what’s wrong.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.839
Because intelligently you understand,
rationally you understand,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.519
logically you understand it is wrong.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.279
But still there is somebody else who says,
“What’s wrong?”

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.079
So now, experiencing it you understand.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.774
That’s the only way left for nature
to make you understand:

00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:21.023
now experience it, suffer it.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:28.419
There is another way, is that you can
experience your Spirit.

00:20:28.699 --> 00:20:32.880
Also it’s possible only this Krita Yuga can
do that,

00:20:33.081 --> 00:20:37.399
that you can experience the enjoyment
of your Spirit.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.203
Both things are there. When it does
one thing, it does the other way also.

00:20:43.404 --> 00:20:51.365
It also gives you the experience
of reality, the experience of truth,

00:20:51.566 --> 00:20:57.759
the life that is eternal, and that’s what
one has to look forward to.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:03.343
But enslavement has to be brought down
to a proper shape, little bit.

00:21:03.544 --> 00:21:06.514
That also it does. I was amazed some people

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:10.470
who had been drunkards and alcoholics,
in Sahaja Yoga they came;

00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:13.861
next day they left it. It does that.

00:21:14.062 --> 00:21:21.479
Enslavement of any kind, of any habit,
is detrimental to our growth in Spirit.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.846
It is detrimental, but doesn’t matter:
if you have some habits

00:21:25.047 --> 00:21:30.684
they just drop out, as you have seen.
Sahaja Yoga is such a kind, compassionate

00:21:30.885 --> 00:21:35.491
happening that it really makes you

00:21:35.692 --> 00:21:42.000
a different person who is a master
of himself; no more enslavement.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:49.839
All this slavishness goes away. All this
fear disappears.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.680
You become master of yourself and in that
mastery you are the master of love,

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:02.405
master of compassion, master of wisdom.
This should happen to all of us.

00:22:02.606 --> 00:22:06.636
You are all due for it. You are
created for it.

00:22:06.837 --> 00:22:09.800
You all have evolved for it. You have
to have it.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.419
But there are so many misidentifications
in us

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.543
with which we are drawn to wrong things,

00:22:16.744 --> 00:22:21.008
to things which are anti-God, which are
anti-Spirit.

00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:25.798
So many things are there which divert
your mind to that

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.359
because you have drawn certain conclusions
about reality.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.600
You think this is the reality. You believe
that this is the reality

00:22:34.778 --> 00:22:40.155
and you want to stick on to that. But that
is not so.

00:22:40.356 --> 00:22:45.960
I tell you, you have to understand that
reality is what it is.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.880
You should face it and enjoy it. Don’t try
to put your ideas on it.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.541
Don’t try to organize the reality. It is
what it is.

00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:59.255
And once you decide within yourself,
“So far I have not known

00:22:59.456 --> 00:23:04.119
and I have to know,” with that humility,
you’ll get it.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.190
It doesn’t mean that you have to surrender
your money or anything,

00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:13.758
your self-respect or your freedom.
On the contrary, you have to enter

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:19.959
into that area where there is supreme
freedom, supreme freedom.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.599
You are not free. If you think you are
free, you are sadly mistaken,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.981
because we are still slaves of so many
things.

00:23:30.182 --> 00:23:35.320
But once a person is free he is not
bothered about anything.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.066
Nothing can make him habituated
to anything. Nothing.

00:23:41.267 --> 00:23:47.491
Such a person lives like a king, whether
he is in a hut, on a street or in a palace.

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:51.936
He is not bothered. Whatever it is he is
the king. He doesn’t want anything anymore.

00:23:52.137 --> 00:23:57.385
He gives. He gives. He’s so rich that
nobody can give him anything.

00:23:57.586 --> 00:24:00.559
He gives and gives and gives.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.879
And only thing that it can do is to give;
it cannot take anything.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.959
The capacity is such that he cannot take
anything from anyone.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.381
No more these attitudes, how to save money,
how to save your labor,

00:24:15.582 --> 00:24:20.360
how to save your chairs, your powers,
your positions.

00:24:20.518 --> 00:24:24.319
Nothing remains there, because you are
the master of everything.

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:31.961
Nothing is more important than your own
Spirit, which you enjoy, which manifests.

00:24:33.255 --> 00:24:37.679
It’s so fortunate that you are born
at a time when it is Krita Yuga,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.607
and you have taken your birth deliberately
to get this realization.

00:24:42.808 --> 00:24:47.803
That’s why you are here. But how many
realize that you have to come

00:24:48.004 --> 00:24:56.320
to terms with many things? You have to seek
the truth and not the untruth.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.159
You don’t have to run after people who
make fools out of you

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.800
or those who try to pamper your ego,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.719
or who put spirits in you, and make useless
cabbages.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:18.599
You have to become something greater,
healthier, mightier

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.588
and loving, affectionate, compassionate.

00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:28.203
That should be the picture of
the personality that has to evolve

00:25:28.404 --> 00:25:31.120
out of human beings. Otherwise we cannot
save this world.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.079
With the kind of people we have we cannot
save.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.295
They are all compromising, they are all
manipulating, maneuvering

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:43.719
as if they are all getting drowned, and
everybody has to somehow or other

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.790
pull out the person ahead of them
to come up.

00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:54.583
All funny things happening in this world.
That is only because we are so insecured.

00:25:54.784 --> 00:26:02.519
The insecurity will all go away once the
light – the light of your Spirit shines.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.976
Let the light shine through and see your
beauty and glory and your strength

00:26:08.177 --> 00:26:13.039
of that great power of love of God
within yourself

00:26:13.216 --> 00:26:16.439
and then you’ll be amazed what it is.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.718
As you know, Sahaja Yoga is not one
lecture, is not two,

00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:28.280
can be hundreds, but the happening takes
[a] split of a second. It should happen.

00:26:28.446 --> 00:26:34.911
Once it happens you can achieve
your realization

00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:39.890
in such a way that you won’t even feel it.

00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:44.720
But afterwards you have to put in
deliberations.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.360
You have to look after yourself. You have
to respect yourself and go ahead with it.

00:26:50.533 --> 00:26:56.403
There’s no use arguing about it. Even if
you argue I can take you up to a point

00:26:56.604 --> 00:27:02.400
because this is the realm beyond the mind,
because mind is a limited thing.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.239
We have to achieve the unlimited and
for that a happening has to take place.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.911
We can’t promise you that it will take
place. If it takes place, well and good,

00:27:12.112 --> 00:27:20.099
we can help you in a way to achieve it, but
we cannot be sure that it will happen.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:27.520
So be in a receptive mood and be kind
to yourself and achieve your realization.

00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:30.448
This is the last time I’m speaking now
in London.

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:38.240
For quite some time I won’t be here, maybe
in November if I come for a short time;

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:44.743
I may be in London, may be outside London,
somewhere in England; I can’t say.

00:27:44.944 --> 00:27:49.933
I hope all those who are today should
decide that if they have

00:27:50.134 --> 00:27:55.400
to achieve their realization as a permanent
blessing from God,

00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:00.440
then they have to go further with it.
You cannot just stop it at this meeting.

00:28:00.641 --> 00:28:04.560
You have to go further with it with greater
enquiries. You have to go

00:28:04.761 --> 00:28:08.639
to different ashrams and centers that
we have; you have to work it out.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.055
If you are a big man, like the other day
somebody came as a managing director

00:28:12.256 --> 00:28:14.497
and tried to be funny, I said, “If you are
a managing director

00:28:14.698 --> 00:28:18.864
this is not the place for you.” God doesn’t
understand. You may be the king.

00:28:19.065 --> 00:28:21.479
You might be the president. You might
be anyone.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.526
God doesn’t understand these man-made
positions. God’s positions are different

00:28:26.727 --> 00:28:31.052
and if you have to enter into the Kingdom
of God come as a humble person.

00:28:31.253 --> 00:28:35.571
Give up all your ideas about your big
positions and big education and all that.

00:28:35.772 --> 00:28:40.799
Be a humble person. If you are humble
then it will work out,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.240
and not only that it will work out but
it is the only chance

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.559
we human beings have to change the whole
world. There’s no other chance I can see.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:59.599
I hope all of you will pay full attention
to it

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:07.591
and ardently, with full devotion, seek your
Self and its ascent and its establishment.

00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:10.802
May God bless you all.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.680
If you have any questions you can ask
Me today.

00:29:43.911 --> 00:29:48.539
Yes. Seeker: Shri Mataji, could you say
something about collective

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:55.426
and the need for people who have been
realized to be together?

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.663
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.839
Yogi: Mother, could you please say
something about the collective

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.582
and the need for realized souls to be
together?

00:30:07.783 --> 00:30:10.945
Shri Mataji: Oh, all right. That’s a very
nice suggestion.

00:30:11.146 --> 00:30:15.289
I would like to say something about
collectivity.

00:30:16.056 --> 00:30:22.413
So far as you know, in the history of
spirituality people have got realization.

00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:28.977
Many people have got it. One after another,
many people got it

00:30:29.178 --> 00:30:38.760
but I would say one in a million, one
in a ten million, like that,

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.702
because we have to have some people to talk
about it, to begin with.

00:30:45.903 --> 00:30:49.759
We always see what was written
in the past, you see,

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:55.239
but those people who got realization
single-handed suffered a lot,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.757
and they could not transmit what it was
needed to be given to others

00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:05.780
in a way that would be acceptable.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:14.319
Now as you see, any discovery is made,
like that people can benefit individually.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.620
Every person can say, “Oh, I have got it.
So I can have it in my house,” you see;

00:31:19.843 --> 00:31:24.639
but it is of no value. It is of no value,
I can tell you.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.653
I would say a personality like Christ came
on this earth. We had Christianity;

00:31:29.854 --> 00:31:32.879
what have they done about it? I mean,
it’s a sad affair.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.812
I mean, to think such a personality to come
and what a great job He has done

00:31:37.013 --> 00:31:41.879
to establish Himself on Agnya chakra,
what people have done out of it, you see.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.381
The reason was He was seldom; He was
alone. It was not a mass thing.

00:31:47.582 --> 00:31:49.880
That was not the time, because He had
to establish this center.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.680
Without that it could not be mass,
all right?

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.520
It could not be an en masse realization
but He talked about,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.244
“You have to be born again,” and all that.
But the whole thing fizzled out

00:32:00.445 --> 00:32:04.560
because they could not get to the essence
of it.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.840
One person of that caliber coming
on this earth

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.584
found it impossible to convince people
and talk about it.

00:32:14.785 --> 00:32:22.542
So one has to understand that anything
that is evolutionary

00:32:22.743 --> 00:32:29.079
first happens to one or two persons only,
but then it happens to many people.

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:33.649
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s another problem
apart from that, that it is happening

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.180
to many people, it is there, no doubt.
Thousands are getting realization,

00:32:37.381 --> 00:32:39.800
it’s no doubt. It’s working out that way,

00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:44.119
that now the evolution has come to this
stage, as I say it’s the blossom time,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.519
many flowers are there and they have
to become the fruits.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.669
But now why is it necessary to have
collectivity when people are getting

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:57.079
realization like that, is a very important
point one has to understand.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:04.760
The thing is that now, when you are getting
realized, what is happening to you?

00:33:04.952 --> 00:33:07.399
You are getting related to the whole.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.518
Our microcosm is getting related
to the macrocosm.

00:33:11.719 --> 00:33:18.080
Say your body is there and you are
sleeping. First you get a little awakening.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:23.400
You open your fingers, all right? Then you
open your, another finger.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.400
Now there is a little trouble on your
finger and you can’t see anything.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.680
So you open your eyes and you pay your
attention to your hands.

00:33:33.881 --> 00:33:38.244
So that trouble may be all right but you
need another hand to help me.

00:33:38.445 --> 00:33:43.330
So you want the another hand also to be
awakened to that point, like that.

00:33:43.531 --> 00:33:48.040
So when the Sahaja Yogis are getting
awakened more and more, you see,

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.200
the problems that are facing us, we can
solve them better,

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.744
because so many people are working out
the problem.

00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:59.303
Do you understand My point now? Together!
When we are together

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:03.880
we understand now there’s a problem,
now I’m going to America.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:12.268
I’ve gone in 1970 - 1973 first, I think,
yes.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:18.810
1973 I went first. I was alone! I mean,
I gave them very good lectures,

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.159
we had very big halls filled up and
everything – but everything fizzled out.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.182
The reason is the people who got
realization didn’t have anybody

00:34:27.383 --> 00:34:31.485
to look after them, there was nobody
to support them, give them assistance,

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:36.639
so they got lost. I mean, they are there,
some of them are here and there.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:43.200
Now what has happened now? Today when
I’m going to America everybody is praying.

00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:47.799
In Australia they are praying. In India
they are praying.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.057
Like attention, you’ll be surprised some
people are coming from India

00:34:51.258 --> 00:34:55.319
to go down to America. Some are coming
from Australia to go down to America.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.879
Some are coming from France, some
from Switzerland.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.960
They are all rushing to America.
Now the job is in America.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.742
All right, so, like the attention you see,
as soon as somebody pricks Me here,

00:35:06.943 --> 00:35:10.510
My hand goes there, My head goes there,
everything works it out.

00:35:10.711 --> 00:35:16.079
So the collective working-out effort
is going to solve the problem.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.220
But supposing if this finger is fighting
with this finger, can I write anything?

00:35:21.421 --> 00:35:26.014
Or if they are secluded and alone,
can I use them?

00:35:26.215 --> 00:35:33.440
All this body has to become absolutely
in concord with each other.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:40.639
But so many are still sleeping. Those who
are awakened at least must stick together.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.519
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.600
Today I find it much easier to give
realization, much easier.

00:35:47.789 --> 00:35:52.129
I was struggling with six people for four
years in your London.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:58.439
Four years, six people. But once they got
realization it started working faster

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.932
and the more people we get – because
the channel that is to be used

00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:09.880
is like nerves in the body. You become
a nerve of that body which is awakened,

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.283
and once the nerves start working out
together

00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:16.680
realizing that there’s one force that is
flowing through them,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:24.438
all of you have to work it out together
with understanding of the Divine.

00:36:24.639 --> 00:36:28.315
It works faster. Any person whose all
nerves are at work

00:36:28.516 --> 00:36:34.840
will be much more dynamic than a person
who is half-dead or is full-dead.

00:36:35.559 --> 00:36:39.399
So you can understand how collectivity
is important.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:46.680
Then another thing is that going to
a very enjoyable part of it,

00:36:46.881 --> 00:36:52.200
that when the Sahaja Yogis are collectively
there, they really enjoy.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.896
Because for the first time you start
enjoying human beings, first time.

00:36:57.097 --> 00:36:58.689
Before this you never enjoyed them.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.440
You enjoyed flowers, you enjoyed everything
else, but not human beings.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.922
Pure enjoyment of human beings starts
coming when you become fully realized.

00:37:08.123 --> 00:37:11.799
I’ll give you an example. We went
to Calcutta for one day

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.559
and I was in a room in one hotel

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.519
and there were three, four Sahaja Yogis
in another hotel - another room,

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.879
and one gentleman came to Me
for his realization.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.479
And when I raised his thing, the Kundalini,
you see, they all got vibrated

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.713
and they all rushed to My room

00:37:35.914 --> 00:37:40.239
to know “What has happened, suddenly how
is it we got such joy within ourselves”.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.826
They came to see, and this man was there.
He was a great soul

00:37:44.027 --> 00:37:46.317
and they felt the vibrations, tremendous,
you see.

00:37:46.518 --> 00:37:52.320
So it is not the happening of an individual.
It is the happening of the whole.

00:37:52.484 --> 00:37:55.406
And the individual effort is going to be
absolutely useless.

00:37:55.607 --> 00:37:59.610
It will be all neutralized. If you sit
at home, do your meditation,

00:37:59.811 --> 00:38:04.930
it won’t work out. You won’t go very far.
Because the whole has to come up.

00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:13.519
I’ll give an example that when you churn
the butter -

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.199
in India, I don’t know, we don’t do that
way; we do it very naturally –

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.479
you put a little butter inside that and
then again you start churning.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.318
So the butter starts gathering round that
butter, all of it comes together.

00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:32.840
But some particles are left out. They stick
to the sides, stick to that.

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:39.680
They are no more as butter; they are thrown
away as buttermilk. Is as simple as that.

00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:46.601
You see, the more you gather together,
you really enjoy the spirit of friendship,

00:38:46.802 --> 00:38:57.159
spirit of mirth, spirit of love in pure
form. So far the love is biased.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:03.519
There’s sex, there’s lust, there’s money,
there’s this, there’s relationship.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.485
This is, “You are British; so I must love
you,” “I am Indian;

00:39:06.686 --> 00:39:09.682
so I must love you.” All these nonsensical
barriers are there.

00:39:09.883 --> 00:39:13.159
There you love a human being because
he is a human being

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.039
and he is a yogi, speaks the same language.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.080
Now today I have attended a wedding party
and the bride and the bridegroom said,

00:39:23.281 --> 00:39:27.639
“We are coming to Paris with you, Mother.
There are hundred people coming to Paris,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.747
because we have to change Paris”, you see.
“But,” I said, “you are recently married.

00:39:31.948 --> 00:39:34.297
Now better enjoy your honeymoon.”
They said, “What are we going to enjoy?

00:39:34.498 --> 00:39:37.239
We’ll enjoy there our honeymoon”,
so they are coming up there.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.840
Even if I tell them, “You don’t come,”
they won’t listen.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.362
They will enjoy their honeymoon there only.

00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:44.914
I never said, “You come”, on the contrary,
I’m saying, “You go away.

00:39:45.115 --> 00:39:47.341
I will give you money to enjoy your
honeymoon wherever you feel like.”

00:39:47.542 --> 00:39:50.479
They wouldn’t go, because they know
where enjoyment lies,

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:55.703
with their brothers, with friends and
sisters. It’s absolutely so,

00:39:55.904 --> 00:40:02.759
I tell you, that the enjoyment of human
beings has not been there.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.731
Now there are people who live in India,
who live in Australia,

00:40:06.932 --> 00:40:09.639
who live here, all over the places,

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.237
but when the Sahaja Yogis go to India
you should see them,

00:40:13.438 --> 00:40:19.027
the way the Sahaja Yogis in the villages,
the way they embrace them,

00:40:19.228 --> 00:40:23.080
the way they feel the oneness. Never
they have felt like this for a white skin.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.482
If they saw a white skin they would just
run away

00:40:25.683 --> 00:40:29.008
and hide themselves under this thing,
you see. And even now

00:40:29.209 --> 00:40:31.653
people are sometimes frightened to see
a white skin in a village.

00:40:31.854 --> 00:40:34.519
They say, “Oh, God, they have come just
to destroy us!” or something like that.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.399
But now that’s over. Now it’s a human
being, a human being is coming.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.464
They are all embracing. For there is
nothing like a black or a white

00:40:42.665 --> 00:40:49.893
or anything left now. It’s such a love that
grows and an understanding.

00:40:50.094 --> 00:40:54.168
That’s only possible if you learn how
to live collectively.

00:40:54.369 --> 00:41:00.359
And collectivity also teaches you where
you are. Very important it is.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.759
A person who has not lived collectively
cannot understand.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.013
I have seen people who have their own
families, live with their families,

00:41:07.214 --> 00:41:11.331
they are Sahaja Yogis - but once they come
to the ashram

00:41:11.532 --> 00:41:14.319
they know they are not yet there.

00:41:14.552 --> 00:41:18.561
Because you have to adjust, you have
to learn to adjust,

00:41:18.762 --> 00:41:24.655
you can’t have private bathroom
to yourself, private room to yourself.

00:41:24.856 --> 00:41:28.252
All right, you can have if you want to have,
but you should also know how to adjust.

00:41:28.453 --> 00:41:30.932
As you know, I live very comfortably
Myself,

00:41:31.133 --> 00:41:33.640
but if it comes to living I can live
anywhere,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.839
I have no problem of comfort or anything.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.800
In the same way we are not barred from
enjoyment. Because of all these things,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.889
the way we carry our bathrooms with us,
we do not enjoy life.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:49.364
[You] see, [you] want to have everything
absolutely first class that has, say,

00:41:49.565 --> 00:41:53.217
that even when we go to the picnic we take
all the metropolitan with us.

00:41:53.418 --> 00:41:56.752
In the same way we cannot enjoy life.
We cannot enjoy nature.

00:41:56.953 --> 00:42:02.441
We cannot enjoy anything as long as we
become just an individual,

00:42:02.642 --> 00:42:05.960
“Oh, I am the one who is going to get it.”

00:42:06.161 --> 00:42:10.989
The last of all we must know by
individualism we become malignant.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:14.855
I don’t say become communist, because
that’s another malignancy;

00:42:15.056 --> 00:42:19.121
but by becoming individuals we become
malignant. What is malignancy?

00:42:19.322 --> 00:42:23.800
That an individual cell takes up upon
itself, “I will grow, I will grow.”

00:42:24.001 --> 00:42:27.864
It doesn’t know how to grow with the whole.
It has no coordination with the whole.

00:42:28.065 --> 00:42:31.879
That’s why you say it is a cancer.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.704
Cancer is nothing but is a malignant cell
which is alone

00:42:35.905 --> 00:42:42.099
and is saying that, “I have to achieve it.
I can do it, I can manage it”.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.399
And once it starts growing like that,

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.839
whosoever it touches, that person becomes
the same.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.520
All these ideas – we are higher race
or we are greater people,

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.642
we are moneyed people, we are something
special,

00:42:57.843 --> 00:43:01.070
we are of this club – all this disappears.

00:43:01.271 --> 00:43:06.533
It’s all nonsensical. We are identified
with nonsensical things

00:43:06.734 --> 00:43:11.119
and making ourselves miserable and others
also miserable.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.674
And then you give up all that. Suddenly
you find, “Oh, what enjoyment!”

00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:21.830
You don’t want anything, you just want
to be in the company of Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:22.031 --> 00:43:25.799
I have seen people, ambassadors, very
highly placed people,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.325
just getting lost with the Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:30.526 --> 00:43:34.509
The other day I had a businessman from
Bombay. I took him down with Me

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:42.356
to a place called Gurai; and it was all
in a mess,

00:43:42.557 --> 00:43:45.760
in the sense there were no proper
bathrooms, there were…

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.650
It was just like a God-forsaken place,
I tell you.

00:43:49.851 --> 00:43:52.839
And there weren’t even places to sit down
properly,

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.799
only the beach and the palm trees and all
sorts of thing was there.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.519
And the man got lost into that, absolutely
lost.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.080
And he said, “I never wanted this day
to finish.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.039
Is the only day I’ve really enjoyed myself
thoroughly”.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.805
Because there was such spontaneity,
such spontaneous love,

00:44:14.006 --> 00:44:20.479
such attention and such purity
in the atmosphere.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:25.097
To enjoy that purity you have to be
in the collective.

00:44:25.298 --> 00:44:29.224
Sitting down in the room, you can’t
understand, there is no reflection of you.

00:44:29.425 --> 00:44:32.920
You can’t understand where are you,
how far you are going.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.599
Collectivity is the most important thing,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.439
and those who try to break the collectivity
are doing anti-Sahaja activity.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:48.679
[You] see, we call it a-Sahaja movement
or you can say a-Sahaja activitiy.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.397
You have to be one with the whole. Those
who have tried to separate themselves,

00:44:53.598 --> 00:44:57.300
all of them go down in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:57.501 --> 00:45:05.023
Try to be one with everyone, to share
and enjoy everybody’s being,

00:45:05.224 --> 00:45:10.771
because God has created you so beautifully.
You are so beautiful.

00:45:10.972 --> 00:45:15.550
And the enjoyment should not be lost
because you have certain barriers;

00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:18.621
like some people can’t take out their
shoes, I mean, just imagine

00:45:18.822 --> 00:45:21.839
how much they are identified with their
shoes.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.957
They can’t take out their shoes. To that
extent they are stupid!

00:45:26.158 --> 00:45:28.691
[You] see, all this kind of stupidity
drops out

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:32.040
once you meet really wise people
around you.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.211
To get rid of all these nonsensical ideas,
which have really

00:45:37.412 --> 00:45:42.330
haunted your head all these days, you get
rid of them

00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:50.040
and you really enjoy everyone, whether
he is a doorman or he is a chairman,

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.960
all of them are men for you. It’s nothing
more than that.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.879
All that drops out and you start enjoying
your Self.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:04.080
That’s why collectivity is the only way
I can work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:04.281 --> 00:46:11.039
I can’t think I can work out through
the people who are separated, divided.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:17.599
It is said, Christ has said also that…
They said, “What have we to do?”

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:23.048
He said, “When you love each other you have
done the greatest justice to Me”.

00:46:23.249 --> 00:46:28.080
It’s true. And when I hear the loving
conversation of the Sahaja Yogis

00:46:28.281 --> 00:46:31.320
I feel the happiest. That’s the greatest
happiness for Me,

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.465
that all of you should love each other
in purity, without any return,

00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:41.840
only for love’s sake you all should love
each other. And that is what it is!

00:46:42.025 --> 00:46:46.400
And also Krishna has said, “Wherever people
are there gathered together

00:46:46.601 --> 00:46:49.363
in the name of God, I reside within them”.

00:46:49.564 --> 00:46:53.404
So in that joint - so-called joint, because
you are all one,

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.640
moving with one rhythm, with one
understanding, with one language,

00:46:58.841 --> 00:47:03.520
so you all should always meet, call each
other and have rapport with each other.

00:47:03.721 --> 00:47:08.680
It’s so beautiful. It’s musical.
It’s poetical.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.419
Do you understand that? May God bless you.

00:47:18.648 --> 00:47:21.840
And see for yourself when you cut out
your collectivity.

00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:25.525
Just abuse yourself at that point. That
this is one thing

00:47:25.726 --> 00:47:30.639
you are trying to teach Me now, I’m not
going to listen to this nonsense.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.774
We are collective being otherwise also.
I mean, we cannot,

00:47:34.975 --> 00:47:38.241
people cannot take even drinks without
somebody being there.

00:47:38.442 --> 00:47:41.771
You can’t take your food alone.
In so many things,

00:47:41.972 --> 00:47:46.879
I mean, if you are not absolutely
a recluse you can’t live alone.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.705
Then in religion, in the seeking,

00:47:50.906 --> 00:47:56.717
especially in the realm of God,
how can it be?

00:47:56.918 --> 00:48:00.573
You all have to be there.

00:48:06.135 --> 00:48:09.679
I think it was a very good question,
rightly asked.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.808
This individualism must be given up.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.904
That doesn’t mean you all should dress up
like military people –

00:48:18.105 --> 00:48:21.319
that’s not necessary –

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.999
or you should all behave in the same
manner – that’s not necessary.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.320
Variety brings all the beauty. But that
doesn’t mean that

00:48:28.521 --> 00:48:35.864
if I say it is East you should say
it is West.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:45.050
That’s the main trouble is, I think,
isn’t it?

00:48:46.026 --> 00:48:50.159
That you can’t agree to each other.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.653
What’s the problem in collectivity,
you think.

00:48:58.447 --> 00:49:01.611
I can ask the question.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:18.115
Must get out of individual limitations.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:31.294
I think everybody should for some time go
and live in an ashram, is a good idea.

00:49:31.495 --> 00:49:33.720
But ashram must be such where there is
collectivity.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.360
In the ashram if they are fighting and
quarrelling -

00:49:40.687 --> 00:49:44.704
then what’s the use of being in the ashram
also? But I leave it to you.

00:49:44.905 --> 00:49:48.399
It’s all freedom to you. You just decide
yourself.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.498
I have not put any rules and regulations
on you much,

00:49:52.699 --> 00:49:59.199
because I want you to use your wisdom
and put everything right yourself.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:05.702
You are all very wise people but must
have concord.

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:10.159
Listen to others. Talk to them. Find out
what’s the problem is.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.679
On small, small things people fight.
It’s a very wrong thing.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:19.040
Moreover, you have to have one person
as a leader to whom you should listen to.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.594
If I find that fellow is useless I’ll throw
him away. You know that very well.

00:50:22.795 --> 00:50:24.932
Throw him away, not in the way people
throw away,

00:50:25.133 --> 00:50:27.665
but he’ll just get out of Sahaja Yoga.
You know that very well.

00:50:27.866 --> 00:50:31.290
So there should be no problem. But
everybody should not

00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:36.038
try to dominate each other. That’s
a wrong idea.

00:50:36.239 --> 00:50:43.513
Try to change your attitude. As I would
say, how far can you adjust?

00:50:43.714 --> 00:50:48.359
How far can you accommodate? Let’s see
that way.

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.697
You have to learn that from Me, isn’t it?

00:50:54.249 --> 00:50:58.520
You must find out ways and methods of
accommodating yourself with others.

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:04.248
Just try to learn. It’s not difficult.
That’s the whole attitude of life,

00:51:04.449 --> 00:51:09.604
is of competition and this and that - should
be changed. You must compete in loving,

00:51:09.805 --> 00:51:13.749
compete in doing good things, compete
at working for others.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:18.025
Like “I’ve opened the door, now I’ll not
take the phone”. Is very common.

00:51:18.226 --> 00:51:24.159
“I’ve washed the things this morning, then
I will not wash in the evening”.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.726
Then people start taking advantage as this.
Let them take advantage;

00:51:27.927 --> 00:51:34.359
it is a disadvantage for them. Actually,
if you see the other side,

00:51:36.303 --> 00:51:41.209
compete in service, compete in love,
compete in good things,

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:46.520
of saying good words, of communicating
in a sweeter way

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.414
that others feel happy, making others
happy.

00:51:50.615 --> 00:51:57.399
Try to change your attitude towards others

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.560
and you’ll really enjoy, I tell you, you’ll
enjoy. That’s the way.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.666
You know, if you say something to hurt
someone and upset someone,

00:52:04.867 --> 00:52:08.320
it must be upsetting you definitely.
You may not show but it must be,

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:12.431
because whatever you do to others comes
back to you. Straightforward march,

00:52:12.632 --> 00:52:18.138
I tell you. It doesn’t stay there
altogether; it comes back to you.

00:52:19.084 --> 00:52:23.199
So just try to be kind to others.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.679
You may say that the other may try to harm
you, doesn’t matter.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.720
Nobody can harm you because you are
the Spirit. Who can harm you?

00:52:30.921 --> 00:52:35.086
You are the Spirit. So just try
to understand the person.

00:52:35.287 --> 00:52:38.930
I tell you, after some time you’ll find
that person will become very soft.

00:52:39.131 --> 00:52:42.200
So many Sahaja Yogis have become like
that automatically.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.240
They all are here for seeking God,
isn’t it?

00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:49.416
So to help them you have to be patient.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.879
Give up your old methods and ways,
I must tell you:

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:59.690
to be curt, to be stern, to be angry,
there’s no need at all!

00:53:02.368 --> 00:53:06.679
I’m telling you from My experience.
I’ve tried all these things.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.907
It works, isn’t it? It does work.

00:53:13.896 --> 00:53:21.458
And you have to have faith in them and
faith in their ascent, in their quality.

00:53:22.644 --> 00:53:28.479
I like people who praise others to Me.
I don’t like people who criticize others.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:32.760
Try to support each other, help each other

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:39.563
and never talk about their past or anything
like that; it’s very sad.

00:53:39.764 --> 00:53:44.067
Sometimes I’ve seen people are very hard
and in anger they say things

00:53:44.267 --> 00:53:46.709
which one should never say. It’s not
gracious.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:52.166
It’s not in the mannerism of Sahaja Yogis.
You should never say these things.

00:53:52.367 --> 00:53:55.959
Do I ever say anything like that to you
about your past?

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.719
When you write to Me, even if I know
everything about you,

00:53:58.899 --> 00:54:01.200
did I ever mention those things to you
at all?

00:54:01.385 --> 00:54:03.480
Then why should you say things of the past?

00:54:03.681 --> 00:54:08.119
I have heard these things people just rake
it up and flung it back.

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.470
I have heard this kind of thing that they
bring it on other people, it’s not good.

00:54:12.671 --> 00:54:17.199
One should be very gracious, very kind,

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.722
and understand that everybody has
tremendous potentiality.

00:54:23.939 --> 00:54:31.532
Respect, respect and respect. Respect
yourself and you’ll respect others.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.560
I hope now you won’t have problem
of collectivity after this lecture,

00:54:35.761 --> 00:54:39.162
and if you have, you can listen to this
lecture again and again;

00:54:39.363 --> 00:54:44.960
and My special humble request that try
to curb down your angles.

00:54:45.161 --> 00:54:49.521
Automatically other angles will calm down.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.200
But if it is a non-Sahaja Yogi then you all
should fight it together.

00:54:56.396 --> 00:54:58.839
All should join together if [it] is
a non-Sahaja Yogi.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:04.763
Nobody dare torture you or trouble you.
Those days are gone now.

00:55:04.964 --> 00:55:08.064
None of you will be troubled.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:15.680
These are all satanic forces and they can
work through you also.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.400
You must know when they give you such ideas
to fight and to quarrel.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:26.760
Understand that this is anti-God. You are
doing God’s work.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:32.719
You have to move towards more
understanding, more coordination;

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.120
because this is such a tremendous work
and of such a sublime nature,

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:42.583
that we have to be sublime ourselves.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:52.624
All right, now is there any other question?
[It] was a very nice suggestion

00:55:52.825 --> 00:55:58.394
but don’t give Me such big suggestions
that I have to speak for half an hour.

00:56:03.289 --> 00:56:06.093
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, when you say
collective consciousness,

00:56:06.294 --> 00:56:11.398
does that exclude all the people who are
not Sahaja Yogis,

00:56:11.599 --> 00:56:14.783
so does that mean that Sahaja Yogis are isolating
themselves

00:56:14.984 --> 00:56:19.063
from the 90% of the people who are not
Sahaja Yogis?

00:56:19.271 --> 00:56:23.628
Shri Mataji: What is she saying? I just
couldn’t hear. Can you come?

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:31.119
You come here and tell Me. Yes, it’s
all right.

00:56:31.467 --> 00:56:34.838
Sahaja Yogini: When you are talking about
being collectively conscious,

00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:39.180
that excludes the people who are not Sahaja
Yogis and therefore the Sahaja Yogis

00:56:39.381 --> 00:56:42.075
are isolating themselves from the people,
from the majority of the other people.

00:56:42.276 --> 00:56:44.999
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s it. No, no, no.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:49.120
She says that when collectively Sahaja
Yogis become one

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.719
then those who are not Sahaja Yogis
are isolated. It’s not so.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.036
You see, Sahaja Yogis have to be strong
enough. Now take it like this,

00:56:58.237 --> 00:57:02.599
that there are people, say, who are
in the water

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.664
and some people are in the boat, all right?

00:57:05.865 --> 00:57:10.941
Now the people who are in the boat are
in the boat, so they are in a way

00:57:11.142 --> 00:57:15.480
different from the people who are in the
water. That’s the situation is, all right?

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:21.400
Now the people in the boat have to save
the people who are in the water, all right?

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:26.399
So what I am saying that those who are
in the boat must first of all be united,

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.411
and then with full strength pull them out.
Why this collectivity?

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:36.943
Is just to pull out the rest of them.
This collectivity is just to achieve

00:57:37.144 --> 00:57:43.269
their emancipation, their realization,
all right? It doesn’t mean that

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:48.559
they should exclude. Actually the whole
collectivity is to bring those people out.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:54.075
But, you see, there are lots of anti-God
activities going on in this world,

00:57:54.276 --> 00:57:58.541
you know that. For example, there’s a guru
who makes lots of money, all right?

00:57:58.742 --> 00:58:03.117
And he has destroyed many people. Now
they come to Me and they are saved.

00:58:03.318 --> 00:58:08.119
So he may send somebody here paid
for a job just to disturb us.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.323
Then the duty of all the Sahaja Yogis is
to get together and see that,

00:58:11.524 --> 00:58:13.939
to tell him that, “You see, now you are
doing wrong.

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.840
Your guru has done wrong to us and he
is going to do wrong to others.

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.319
Why do you join with that?” On that point
everybody should be one.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.679
But if they are not strong and if they are
not one, they cannot pull out others.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.571
You see, My point is like that. Not
to exclude - is all,

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:37.820
collectivity is to include everyone inside.
All right?

00:58:42.871 --> 00:58:48.119
I mean to say, there is no specialization
in Sahaja Yoga, in simple words.

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:53.655
Everybody is a doctor of everything.

00:59:07.934 --> 00:59:13.546
I mean to say that all the Sahaja Yogis
must form a strong group

00:59:13.746 --> 00:59:18.229
by which they achieve enlargement
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:25.702
getting more people into Sahaja Yoga, more
people benefitted by Sahaja Yoga, all right?

00:59:25.903 --> 00:59:29.983
All - anywhere I have seen, wherever there
is collectivity, like I would say,

00:59:30.201 --> 00:59:36.602
Australia has the maximum collectivity,
or India of course it has, but Australia,

00:59:36.803 --> 00:59:40.519
in all the European countries, or I should
say the western-styled communities,

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:46.879
Australia has the maximum collectivity and
they have achieved the maximum results.

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:50.800
Only in Sydney, today only, Warren told Me

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.959
that the halls like this get packed
for programmes.

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.200
Melbourne, there is no room for new people
who are coming,

01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:05.559
and it’s such a big compound I’m amazed,
I mean, how many must be going there.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.044
And it is because of collectivity.
And as soon as I went there

01:00:10.245 --> 01:00:14.920
it started gathering up. But before that
the people were fighting among themselves

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.120
and many people ran away from Sahaja Yoga
because they thought,

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.519
“These people are fighting, what are they
going to give us?”

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:29.821
Maximum is in Australia, I think. Then is
Austria is having some problem there,

01:00:30.022 --> 01:00:35.270
and as soon as the problem came in,
the whole thing became a very small group.

01:00:35.471 --> 01:00:38.843
Again that problem is over now; positivity
has come;

01:00:39.044 --> 01:00:42.399
the people have joined together; again
it has flourished.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:46.471
It happens here also, we have seen.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.542
Why Labor Party lost? If they had
not quarrelled

01:00:50.743 --> 01:00:54.861
they would not have been so badly off.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.979
Is absolutely a simple equation,

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.683
“United we stand,” isn’t it?

01:01:08.528 --> 01:01:11.865
Is there any other question?

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:23.839
All right. So how many are new people
today here?

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:33.479
Can you raise your hands please?
One, two, three, five, six.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.119
All right. Can I request you to come
to the front seats?

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.959
That will be better, will help Me
better too,

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.805
because you are so much here and there,
all right? Just come, please.

01:01:43.006 --> 01:01:46.917
Be comfortable. Yes, come along,
all of you.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:53.182
Just be seated. Yes. Be comfortable.

01:01:53.399 --> 01:01:58.797
Now get some more chairs.

01:02:00.369 --> 01:02:04.585
Can you get some more chairs here
for the front seats?

01:02:05.247 --> 01:02:08.737
Douglas, can you put them in a line?

01:02:09.866 --> 01:02:15.384
They cannot be lifted; they are fixed,
are they? All right.

01:02:36.832 --> 01:02:40.080
Now for all the new people I have to say
one thing,

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.256
that, you see, you cannot argue it out.

01:02:44.457 --> 01:02:49.200
It has to work within you. It has to work
within you. It’s a happening.

01:02:49.401 --> 01:02:54.919
There is a force within you which we call
as Kundalini,

01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:03.174
which is the pure desire of becoming one
with the Spirit.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:08.279
All other desires are impure. That’s why
you are never satisfied.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.639
Now this desire is not yet awakened
within us.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:18.680
This power of desire, or energy of desire,
resides in the sacrum bone

01:03:18.881 --> 01:03:24.167
and it has to be awakened, and when
it is awakened, it rises,

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:27.959
passes through six centers, subtle centers,

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.520
comes out of your medulla oblongata
into the brain

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.604
and then, out of this part which was a soft
bone in your childhood,

01:03:39.805 --> 01:03:44.239
and you start feeling a cool breeze coming
out of your head,

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.679
and a cool breeze coming out of your hands
also afterwards.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:56.508
Now this is a living process, as you cannot
force a seed to sprout.

01:03:56.709 --> 01:04:01.399
It sprouts by itself spontaneously, but you
have to put it in the Mother Earth.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:12.078
In the same way it sprouts. It sprouts
spontaneously

01:04:12.279 --> 01:04:19.174
and when it happens then you have to see
for yourself.

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:24.294
One can help because if there is
an obstruction on any chakras,

01:04:24.495 --> 01:04:27.559
especially if the Nabhi chakra is
caught up,

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.080
then what happens that on that center
the Kundalini tries to push

01:04:33.259 --> 01:04:37.399
and you can easily see with your naked
eyes the pulsation

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:43.319
or the movement of your sacrum bone
just like a heart, just like a heart.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:51.720
These things you cannot maneuver, you
cannot attain by effort.

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:56.999
Is a thing already settled there within you
and this has to be awakened.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:04.198
Now what we can do is to try to remove
the hurdles that are there

01:05:04.399 --> 01:05:08.576
during the ascent of the Kundalini.
That’s all we can do.

01:05:08.777 --> 01:05:14.679
But if it doesn’t work out, we can work out
again and we can work out again.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:20.920
But you have to have patience with yourself
and you have to have understanding

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.119
that you will get your realization.
It’s not so difficult.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.680
All of these people who are sitting here
have got realization

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:32.959
and most of them are settled down
with their realization.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.080
They know what the chakras are, what
are the obstructions,

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.399
how to remove the obstructions and how
to raise the Kundalini.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.399
All this you will also know. All this
mastery you will also have,

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.680
but you have to, as I said, you have
to have that earnestness

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.520
and that kind of assiduity by which
you’ll achieve it.

01:05:54.721 --> 01:06:03.530
So it is for us to raise your Kundalini and
it is for us to help you to achieve it.

01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:06.987
Then once you have achieved it and you
have mastered it,

01:06:07.188 --> 01:06:12.560
it is for you to teach others and to give
realization to others.

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:18.728
It is as simple as that. So I’m sure
it will work out tonight

01:06:18.929 --> 01:06:23.920
and that all will work it out. We should
all cooperate with each other.

01:06:24.121 --> 01:06:27.099
Now some people who are frightened,
I have to tell them

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.080
there’s nothing to be frightened
in Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.639
Thousands of people have got realization
without any difficulty.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.079
Or those who are still discussing in their
minds, must stop it now,

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.879
because they have not found it; better
prepare yourself to have the realization.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.778
It is not to be paid for. You cannot put in
any effort. Nothing can be done.

01:06:49.979 --> 01:06:53.480
It has to work out, all right?

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.036
With this understanding let us see that

01:06:57.237 --> 01:07:00.360
few things, whatever I tell you, you try
to cooperate with Me.

01:07:00.548 --> 01:07:04.800
One of them is a simple thing, is to remove
your shoes. Please remove your shoes.

01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:08.325
There’s nothing in the shoes, you see.
If you remove the shoes,

01:07:08.526 --> 01:07:14.462
you’ll become relaxed, little bit more,
and also I feel that it helps

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:19.630
the Mother Earth to suck in problems
very well.

01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:23.039
It’s a very simple method by which
it should work out.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:29.740
So I would request you to put both your
hands towards Me, just like this,

01:07:29.941 --> 01:07:36.080
and close your eyes. That’s all. Just
close your eyes.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:47.022
You will also know why I asked you to put
your hands towards Me later on.

01:07:47.223 --> 01:07:52.757
So don’t think about it. There are five
fingers and six centers –

01:07:52.958 --> 01:07:57.840
and seven centers all on your hands, and
when you put your hands towards Me

01:07:58.014 --> 01:08:01.200
the message goes to the Kundalini
and it rises.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.239
It’s your own, everything is your own.
Only thing like one enlightened light

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.360
enlightens another light, I’m just
enlightening you

01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:12.989
and then you can enlighten others exactly
the same way.

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:17.111
All right. I would request you also to take
out your spectacles

01:08:17.312 --> 01:08:20.277
if you have any, because it helps your
eyesight also.

01:08:20.478 --> 01:08:23.423
It helps your eyesight. Just take out
your spectacles.

01:08:23.624 --> 01:08:28.879
Any other obstacle, anything that is little
bit uncomfortable,

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.240
you can reduce the pressure on your waist
if it is very tight;

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.559
or anywhere you feel the tightness you can
reduce.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.817
Put both the feet on the ground, little
separate from each other

01:08:41.018 --> 01:08:46.282
because both feet have different problems,
are to be attended to differently.

01:08:46.483 --> 01:08:51.203
Now please keep your eyes shut and I would
request you not to open your eyes

01:08:51.404 --> 01:08:54.960
till I tell you, because if your eyes are
open

01:08:55.161 --> 01:09:02.552
the Kundalini refuses to rise up to Agnya.
So please keep your eyes shut.

01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:08.589
Just with complete faith in yourself

01:09:11.017 --> 01:09:14.999
you just wait and it will work out.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:21.959
If it doesn’t work out, we’ll try to tell
you how you yourself can work it out

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:28.111
by awakening your own centers.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.887
You have to sit quietly.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.416
Please put your right hand – don’t open
your eyes –

01:09:55.617 --> 01:09:59.014
please put your right hand on your heart.

01:09:59.215 --> 01:10:03.680
Because the left hand is the hand
of your desire

01:10:03.881 --> 01:10:07.599
so it should be kept where it is now
throughout.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:15.039
Only you have to move the right hand because
the right hand is the hand of action.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.974
Now at this stage you have to say – if you
are wearing a coat

01:10:19.175 --> 01:10:23.849
put it from inside the coat, would be
better – hand on your heart

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:31.239
and left hand towards Me on the lap,
comfortably.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.774
Now you please in your heart, with all
sincerity

01:10:36.975 --> 01:10:42.720
you have to ask the question thrice,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:47.422
Now why I say that you call Me Mother,
because you have to call Me

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:51.604
Shri Mataji, which is a tongue twister
and I think it will be difficult.

01:10:51.805 --> 01:10:56.481
So to make it easier, I say “Call Me
Mother”.

01:11:04.792 --> 01:11:10.146
Please ask the question, “Mother, am I
the Spirit?”.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:23.683
Because the Spirit has to come in your
attention; you have to become the Spirit.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:30.809
Many people think if you pray without being
realized, God will do what you want.

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:35.643
He won’t, because you are not yet
connected. You have to be connected to God.

01:11:35.844 --> 01:11:38.840
That’s why Christ has said you are to be
born again.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.520
That’s not an artificial thing, it’s
a reality.

01:11:45.584 --> 01:11:53.560
Now as the Spirit is your guide, it is your
guru, you don’t need any guide anymore,

01:11:53.771 --> 01:11:59.185
put this right hand down on the stomach
on the left hand side again,

01:11:59.386 --> 01:12:05.081
and push it a little. On your stomach
on the left hand side put the right hand

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.759
and left hand towards Me, and push it
a little bit and say –

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.502
you must put your hand on your stomach,
stomach on the left hand side

01:12:17.703 --> 01:12:24.657
and press it a little bit because there
lies – the right hand, the right hand,

01:12:24.858 --> 01:12:32.845
take it to the left side and put it
on the center on the left side.

01:12:33.569 --> 01:12:39.960
And now you ask the question, “Mother,
am I my own guide?

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:43.640
Am I my own master? Am I my own guru?”

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:50.960
Ask the question ten times because there
are ten sub-plexuses within us.

01:13:02.124 --> 01:13:07.639
Later on your own guru, which is your
own Spirit, will guide you

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.200
because you’ll get vibratory awareness,
a new dimension in your awareness.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.639
You’ll become collectively conscious.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.754
You’ll become, again. It’s not just
a lecture but it is a happening.

01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:29.294
Please ask ten times, “Mother, am I
my own guide? Am I my own guru?”.

01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:06.061
Now again put the same right hand
on your heart

01:14:06.262 --> 01:14:12.640
and now you can assert by saying, “Mother,
I am the Spirit”.

01:14:12.819 --> 01:14:19.119
Just say that. On the heart, on the heart,
put it on the heart,

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.600
the right hand on the heart, where
the Spirit is,

01:14:22.774 --> 01:14:26.533
where it resides, is reflected
in your heart.

01:14:26.752 --> 01:14:34.283
So just say, “Mother, I am the Spirit”,
with full assertion.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:41.200
You have to say that twelve times.

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:25.950
Now as the Spirit is guiltless, it never
commits sins, it is blemishless,

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.184
it is absolutely spotlessly clean,
sparkling diamond within you,

01:15:32.385 --> 01:15:37.040
you have to raise this right hand at the
base of the neck on the left hand side.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:39.360
We have to move on the left hand side,
throughout.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.822
At the base of the neck on the left hand
side. This is a very important center,

01:15:44.023 --> 01:15:51.763
very important center for the Western
people is through the neck,

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:56.978
at the neck on the left hand side.

01:15:59.315 --> 01:16:04.412
You put it on your shoulders on the left
hand side.

01:16:04.613 --> 01:16:08.606
Just take it from the front, will be
easier, yes; and press it hard.

01:16:08.807 --> 01:16:14.653
And at this center you have to say that,
“Mother, I’m not guilty,”

01:16:14.854 --> 01:16:20.479
sixteen times, because if you are
the Spirit, how can you be guilty?

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.480
But really you must say, “I’m not guilty.”

01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:28.350
Get away from all ideas that you have done
this wrong or that,

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:32.435
you have committed this sin and that sin.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:59.790
“Mother, I’m not guilty.” Say it sixteen
times, please.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.239
You are not guilty; you are just thinking
like that.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.704
By thinking you have made yourself
miserable.

01:17:10.999 --> 01:17:15.084
There’s not to feel guilty about anything.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:18:00.200
Now raise the same hand on your forehead.
Across. On your forehead across.

01:18:03.991 --> 01:18:12.599
At this point you have to forgive others.
This is the center of Christ.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.439
He forgave the people who crucified Him.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:25.159
In the same way you forgive everyone.
Forgive everyone.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.160
Please forgive everyone. People say it is
difficult to forgive,

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:33.217
but if you don’t forgive, actually what
you are doing

01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:37.384
is you are harming yourself, and not
the people who have harmed you.

01:18:37.585 --> 01:18:43.225
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.000
From your heart. Whatever you are saying,
is working out.

01:18:58.201 --> 01:19:02.399
So please say, “Mother, I forgive
everyone.”

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.450
If you don’t say it from your heart,
it will have no effect.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:13.780
Now put the hand on top of your head,

01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:19.635
where you had a soft bone, press it hard
with your palm.

01:19:19.836 --> 01:19:25.847
And just move it a little bit, sideways
if you put it is easier,

01:19:26.048 --> 01:19:32.040
in a clockwise manner – your head,
your scalp – you can say.

01:19:32.639 --> 01:19:38.039
At this point it is the liberation point,

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.960
is that point where you get your moksha,
where you get your realization.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.310
And I can’t cross your freedom. At this
point you have to say,

01:19:48.511 --> 01:19:53.734
“Mother, I want my realization, please
give me my realization”,

01:19:53.935 --> 01:19:59.360
at least seven times. Say it seven times.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:20.885
[A] lot of a heat is coming out. That’s
a good thing. Let the heat come out.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:32.200
Now raise the hand and see if there’s
a cool breeze

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.119
or a hot breeze is coming out. First
the heat will come out.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.280
You can change over your hand and see
with the other hand.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.421
With the right hand towards Me, with
the right hand towards Me

01:20:42.622 --> 01:20:47.720
and [the] left hand on top and see if
there’s a cool breeze coming out.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.955
You may change again your hand, whenever
you feel like

01:21:59.156 --> 01:22:04.733
you can change your hand, and see if
there’s a cool breeze coming out.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:15.927
He’s got it. He’s a born realized.
No problem with him. He is!

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.240
Let him feel yours.

01:22:23.221 --> 01:22:27.996
Just feel him. On top, yes.

01:22:30.247 --> 01:22:33.222
He’s got it?

01:22:40.959 --> 01:22:47.453
Their certificates are correct. If they
give you the certificate.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.640
You have got it, long time back.

01:22:54.685 --> 01:22:59.675
Have you felt it? Not yet. Don’t open
your eyes. Keep your eyes shut.

01:22:59.876 --> 01:23:02.573
It will work out.

01:23:03.939 --> 01:23:07.440
You exchange your hands one by one
and see for yourself.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:12.215
Put your attention there and see. You have
to work it out yourself.

01:23:12.415 --> 01:23:15.639
Don’t get disappointed and don’t feel bad
about it.

01:23:15.841 --> 01:23:19.836
Just go ahead with it. It will work out.

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:29.439
Now I’ll ask some of the Sahaj Yogis
to come and see and help you.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:33.515
Please come along. At the back of these
people, you know, those who are sitting,

01:23:33.716 --> 01:23:39.160
can you see for that – this little one can
find out about everyone.

01:23:46.324 --> 01:23:48.890
Now here, keep your eyes shut. It will
work out.

01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:51.600
Don’t you worry and don’t feel
disappointed.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:55.679
It has to work out. It has to work out.
Did you feel the cool breeze?

01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.516
Good. You have felt it already. Good.
What about you? No?

01:24:00.717 --> 01:24:04.840
Why, why are you so dejected? It will
work out.

01:24:07.351 --> 01:24:11.999
John? Just try this gentleman.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.040
Now, don’t think about it, just you keep
in meditation.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.600
He’s got it. The first one has got it.
[The] second gentleman.

01:24:20.856 --> 01:24:24.487
Shri Mataji: Now, what’s your name?
Child: Anna. Shri Mataji: Anna.

01:24:24.688 --> 01:24:29.796
Child: [Indistinct]

01:24:32.506 --> 01:24:34.666
Shri Mataji: Let’s have him here,
let’s have him here.

01:24:34.867 --> 01:24:38.914
She’s going to America now, she’s going
to America.

01:24:41.835 --> 01:24:45.271
[Indistinct]

01:24:53.092 --> 01:24:56.282
Hello, William, come along!

01:24:56.483 --> 01:25:00.622
Come up, come up, come up. Take some
chana.

01:25:00.823 --> 01:25:04.732
Be careful! Be careful.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.641
Come along. William? Come here.

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:20.971
What about his teeth? Yogini: Yes, he’s
already got two big teeth coming, Mother.

01:25:21.172 --> 01:25:27.189
Shri Mataji: But how can he eat this, he
will eat? Can he manage? All right.

01:25:36.402 --> 01:25:40.500
Come from this side, all right? For you may
fall. Now come from this side, all right?

01:25:40.701 --> 01:25:46.035
We’ll keep this one there. All right, now.
Now.

01:25:53.142 --> 01:25:56.737
You take this. Do you want to have?

01:26:04.988 --> 01:26:08.020
Do you like it? Good! Will you have
some more?

01:26:08.245 --> 01:26:12.563
Will you have some more in your hand?
All right, you have it.

01:26:13.273 --> 01:26:16.529
What about you? Will you have some more?
Child: More!

01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:20.534
Shri Mataji: More? Where is it going?
In your stomach?

01:26:26.177 --> 01:26:29.115
Now come along, come along. You have it.

01:26:32.618 --> 01:26:35.740
You go then digest it there. Digest it.

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:39.339
Will you have this, first you eat that. Hm?

01:26:41.491 --> 01:26:47.291
Oh. Take this, take this. Throw it away.

01:26:48.567 --> 01:26:53.924
Now, just come here. Come, come, come.

01:26:55.244 --> 01:26:59.581
Who is that? …

01:27:05.416 --> 01:27:09.312
You all stand there… should not fall out.

01:27:13.579 --> 01:27:17.047
Elizabeth? Will you have some more?
