00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:16.417
So, that's how the life went on but inner
being was still seeking the way and methods

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:24.359
of giving en-masse realization. My father 
said, "Before You do not develop this technique

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:29.503
of giving en-masse realization, don't talk
of religion. Let nobody know that You know

00:00:29.503 --> 00:00:35.351
anything about it because they'll crucify 
You or," he was rather worried that people

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:39.781
won't understand or You may write another
Bible or Gita - no use. First of all,

00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:45.072
You must give them realization. If they get
their realization, then they will realize that

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:51.028
there's some thing above it, above this
human awareness." For example, he always

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:56.169
used to give an analogy, "Supposing, You
are born on the tenth storey and everybody

00:00:56.169 --> 00:01:00.674
is on the ground, You must at least make
them climb two storeys so they know there's

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:06.116
something above it otherwise no use talking
about it." And he said, "This is the mistake

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:12.504
between the saints and the Incarnations was,
that they never realized that these people are

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:18.937
still on the ground, they have to still
enter into the building, so that is what,

00:01:18.937 --> 00:01:23.348
you have to be very careful that first of
all, You must give realization to people."

00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:30.488
So, I was seeking the ways and methods,
working it out inside Myself through My

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:36.285
own style of meditation, in the sense that, I would
work out all the permutations and combinations.

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:41.359
Supposing I met one person, then I would 
see what problems that person had, how will

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:49.138
you overcome it like that, I would try to
study that person internally. And I went

00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:54.172
to many people to find out but I found 
they were great hypocrites. I saw so many

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:58.750
of these gurus. Most of them I saw them,
I was surprised, they were all hypocrites,

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:06.532
money making and this thing and also I went
to Rajneesh also to see him. Then he said that

00:02:06.532 --> 00:02:11.604
I should come to his program. I didn't
know what sort of a man because he was

00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:15.446
talking about Gita and big, big things. I
thought he might be knowing something about it.

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:20.099
Went there, but My husband said, "No, I
won't allow You to go to his camp," so he

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.528
arranged his own bungalow and all that
for Me, so I went down there and there

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:29.234
I couldn't see all the things that were going
on and that is the day, somehow or other,

00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:34.528
I said, "I must open the last chakra." So
the last chakra was opened. And I saw the

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:41.267
Kundalini, which is the Primordial force
within us, which is the Holy Ghost within us

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:51.655
rising, like a telescope, opening out it's and
then I saw, the whole thing opened and a

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:59.440
big torrential rain of Grace started flowing
through My head, all over, as if, and I felt

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.033
I'm lost now, I'm no more there, it's only
the Grace is there that is there. I saw it

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:13.631
completely happening to Me. And, but I was
amazed that when I went to Rajnish, you see,

00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:16.836
because before going I had to say, good-bye
and he never realized what had happened or

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:22.143
anything, you see. So, I was surprised, I said,
"This man doesn't know anything about God."

00:03:22.888 --> 00:03:26.658
And then I discovered that they were all
hypocrites and telling lies.

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:37.455
So in 1973 this happened on the 5th of May
-'70, 1970, 5th of May and just after that

00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:42.872
I, we had a very big lecture in Jahangir
Hall, there's a very big hall and thousands

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:47.093
of people had come. I told them very frankly
that, "These are all thugs and these are

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:51.159
like these hypocrites, some of them are
demonic, some are evil people." I took their

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.605
names, everything. I told them, "Don't go
near them," and there were so many others,

00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:00.699
whom I told these things very clearly and
they got frightened. They said, "You shouldn't

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.079
say like this, they will come and murder You, they'll
do.." I said, "Let them come and murder Me,"

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.667
but nobody did anything, nobody even went
to the courts. And that's how, you see,

00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:17.115
they tried to bring bad name to Me. They
paid money to the newspapers to publish

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:21.627
things against Me because I said, "You
cannot pay money," so they thought that

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:26.887
I was just trying to, you see, harm them
by saying such a thing that,

00:04:26.887 --> 00:04:32.015
"You can't earn money in the name of God."
If it's a job, you can do it but God's work

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:41.108
is not a job. And the struggle started 
from the day I started giving realization

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:48.519
and I started with one lady, who got realization
first. Then we got about twelve people who got

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:57.083
realization. In two years I got only about
fourteen people realization. Then gradually,

00:04:57.083 --> 00:05:01.523
when fourteen people got realization, then
many others started getting realization

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:09.855
but I started also curing people because
that was helping a lot. Then, My husband

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:15.748
got elected to this post and we had to
come to London. So when I came to London,

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:21.165
we had one program in Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan,
they arranged it. So the Indians abroad,

00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:26.541
are not so much interested in God, they are
more interested in money. So none of the Indians

00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:33.041
stayed there - they all ran away - and 
only the foreigners who were there, were

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:37.902
about seven hippies, so I had to work
on them - seven hippies, for four years

00:05:37.902 --> 00:05:43.338
I was working on them to give them realization.
Very difficult, you see. Their liver was bad,

00:05:43.338 --> 00:05:48.556
they had ill health, their head was on - 
terrible times - but in between I used to

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:53.738
go to India and in India also the work was done;
For three months always I would be in India.

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:59.341
So we started work in the villages,
specially surprisingly, where My forefathers

00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:04.247
were ruling in that area the work started 
moving in a very big way. And there, then

00:06:04.247 --> 00:06:10.548
we started taking some people from India.
Then some people came from Australia to India,

00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:18.139
like that and the work started moving in
those directions. Then gradually, the work

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.953
improved and people found that, this is
the way we can transform ourselves.

00:06:22.953 --> 00:06:29.862
Many people, who were taking drugs or alcoholic
or mad people or cancer people, they felt

00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:36.945
better, then they got cured and it was established
that Sahaja yoga is something very important.

00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:44.841
Now, when I travel all over the world, you see,
first time My husband used to pay for everything.

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:51.472
Wherever I went, he had to pay or any expenses
he used to do for Me. Gradually, then now,

00:06:51.472 --> 00:06:56.903
these people pay for My travel but otherwise
they don't have to pay for anything else.

00:06:57.451 --> 00:07:04.791
That's how we started our work. There was
lot of opposition and the media people

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:11.497
would never understand it because it was no 
'such a sensation', as you can say, nothing

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:15.755
to people feel excited but in a way it's
very great thing because if this is the

00:07:15.755 --> 00:07:22.255
solution for the whole world, one should
try to do it. Then we had very big people

00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:32.195
who came to Sahaja yoga, like we can say,
the Hague High Court judge, who is now

00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:42.106
the President, who has given Nicaragua, 
this thing, judgment. He and many lawyers

00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:48.059
and many barristers, we have one barrister
here from Algeria and doctors and then

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:53.016
they took over and they started helping 
Me out, how to propagate Sahaja yoga.

00:07:55.143 --> 00:08:00.033
But it was a difficult task in the West.
Of course, in India, it spread very fast

00:08:00.033 --> 00:08:04.575
in the villages but city people, in India
also, are Westernized and they'll start

00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:09.530
analyzing. They don't know much about our
past, they don't know anything about our

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.818
heritage, that we have our Kundalini
and all that. But some people do know

00:08:13.818 --> 00:08:18.507
about Self-realization. But these gurus
could not stick on in India because nobody

00:08:18.507 --> 00:08:22.884
would accept them, so they all ran away
abroad. And that was something, a blessing

00:08:22.884 --> 00:08:28.916
for Me also because I didn't have to fight
them there. And it started working out

00:08:28.916 --> 00:08:33.780
and then people found that it helps in 
every way and they found so many miracles

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:40.923
about it and that's how, Sahaja yoga got
settled quite a lot. But still, I would say that,

00:08:40.923 --> 00:08:46.225
we have not been to certain countries so
far and in the West, I would say that

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:48.666
so much work has still to be done.
