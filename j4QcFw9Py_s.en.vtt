00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.569
Today I was thinking of telling you about
the ego problem, because I think everybody

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.730
feels that that’s the biggest problem they
all have; and there’s a big ego trip one

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.200
gets into, and they don’t know what to do
with it.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.470
So first part I will tell you how the ego
rises and how, what it does to us; the second

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:39.260
how to understand it, how to tackle the position
of ego and put it in its own aspect.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:51.100
As you see in the map here, the yellow stuff
that you see on top is the ego.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.550
The balloon that is yellow is the ego.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.620
You see down below it starts from the Swadhishthana.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:10.770
This is the colour of the bile within us,
and this Swadhishthana Chakra which is for

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:21.670
our creativity is directly connected to that
ego there.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:33.640
And when it starts rotating round the Void
and going to the various parts of the Void,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.920
it collects all the problems of the Void.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:58.120
Void is that green circle within us where
physically we have in the Void, we have uterus,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.060
we have kidney – it’s a complete viscera:
all the intestines, ascending, transverse,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:23.280
descending colon, liver, is the upper part
of liver more, then also pancreas and the spleen.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.630
So all the problems of these organs are collected
by this chakra which moves.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:40.420
It comes out of the Nabhi Chakra and moves
round and round and round, and collects all the problems.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:58.250
It nourishes, gives power, the vital power
to these organs, and also it generates necessary

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.590
power for our creative action.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:18.020
It also collects the fat cells of the Void,
convert it into the proper cells for the brain,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.670
for its use, for the grey matter.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.530
All this work it has to do, one chakra.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.500
It manifests aortic plexus outside.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.900
On the physical level we call it as aortic
plexus, and it has got six sub-plexuses which

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.850
look after all these organs.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.210
This is meant for our action.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.050
When we go into action, this chakra starts
working.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:04.319
By the first power, which is on the left-hand
side, we desire.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:19.239
But by the second one we go into action, and
it’s called as kriya shakti.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:32.050
Now when this action starts within us, it
produces the by-products or we can say all

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:45.169
the problems of these organs, which are to
be deposited somewhere, and they are all deposited in the brain as ego.

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:59.081
All the problems that we have out of these,
this creativity and the action of all these

00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:05.520
organs are to be counterbalanced, and as a
counterbalance the ego develops.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.830
For example, now I have to come and meet you
all here.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:17.020
I had to get out of the house, I had to change,
I had to drive, whatever it is, then I came,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.740
I had to put in effort.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.360
I had to plan out how I’m going to talk
to you – that I don’t do normally, but

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.800
I’m saying in generally people do it.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.479
And I put in the effort to come in.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.050
Now how am I to justify this, all this effort?

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:49.680
What is the satisfaction that one gets out
of doing this effort, this kriya, this action?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:58.469
We go on doing some action, and why should
we do it?

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:09.509
After all, action means, any activity means
exertion, botheration, problems, so best is

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.020
to sit at home and do nothing of the kind!

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.270
But we do not do that, we take up challenges,
we rush up to it.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.020
All this we do with our kriya shakti, with
our right action.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.490
Because we do action, we have to have a satisfaction
about it.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.129
As a reaction to that, ego develops.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:42.020
If we do not have the ego we would not do
anything – is a fact.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:51.469
But ego is the one that rationalises all our
madness, the rat race we are running into.

00:06:51.469 --> 00:07:00.349
If we did not have the ego we would not go
into this nonsense.

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:06.179
The more we try to rationalise our activities,
the more ego develops to satisfy.

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:07.439
“All right, very good, very good.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.629
Now you are a successful man, see?

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:16.879
You’re a very successful man, you have got
this, you have got that."

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:22.930
Lots of misunderstandings creep in when we
pamper our ego like this – or I should say

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:30.669
that when we are satisfied with our ego – that
we really get lost.

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:36.410
We get identified with our ego and not with
ourselves.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:44.860
So if you do some work very well: supposing
you have, say, made a beautiful poetry or,

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:53.219
say, not piece of poetry but say you have
made a very good painting, then you would

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:54.699
like people to appreciate.

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:58.740
If they do not appreciate you, you think you
have done nothing, though you have done a

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.729
beautiful poem – of a canvas.

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:09.770
But still you will be so dissatisfied with
yourself unless and until people appreciate you.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:15.330
They must garland you, they must say, “Oh,
you are great, you are really unique, you are a genius."

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:25.729
You know many artist who created great art,
got trapped into this kind of misidentification.

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:36.260
When they created some great art, the art
could not give them satisfaction.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.690
They had to go to ego, and Mr.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.490
Ego would not be satisfied unless and until
everybody says, “Yes, yes, you are very good.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.550
You have done this, you are a genius, you
are this, you are that."

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.870
That’s how the ego develops then within
us.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:06.100
But a situation can arise where even when
we have done nothing, we want to take the credit.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:15.950
Then we call such a person egoistical who
says, “I will do this, I have done this,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.040
I, I, I, I” – then we call him an egoistical
person.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.510
Because he gives words to his ego, that’s
why we call him egoistical.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.320
But all of us have got this Mr.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.770
Ego there, sitting on our heads.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:37.250
When it starts bloating, the more successful
you are, the worse it is.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.970
The more you indulge into planning and thinking,
the worse it is.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.750
The balloon goes on, you see, pumped as if
you are pumping a balloon, you see.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.900
The more you pump, the more it becomes.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:59.250
And you can never realise that you are not
that ego.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:05.610
Then you start feeling very nice about it,
because everybody says, “Oh, what a great man he is."

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.550
The whole society develops on those lines.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:18.870
Today only I was discussing about the way
people give you “C.O.B." , I don’t know, “V.I.P." and “M.A.D."

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:26.950
like that, and we carry those banners with
us.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.960
And we expect everybody should respect those
banners which have been given to us, you see,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.971
because we’ve done some work, somebody has
recognised us, branded it, stamped it, so

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:40.020
we believe really this must be something great.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.300
So we accept that brand and we want to keep
it up.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:54.800
So there’s a doubly fixed thing that you
are really rewarded for what work you are doing.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:03.370
That’s why people start become nuisance
also.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:09.560
Supposing in a society some people do not
find any significance to their lives.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.720
Then they will go to Oxford Street, stand
there, wear funny dresses, start jumping and

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.620
singing something nonsensical, and people
make a nuisance out of themselves.We have

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:30.990
seen people who paint their hair in different
colours, put pencils in the noses, I think,

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:37.600
and do all kinds of mad things just to attract
the attention of others; because we want to

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.400
attract the attention of others, because our
ego is not yet satisfied.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.770
But this ego is never satisfied.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:12:00.620
It goes on asking for more food, more food,
and you enjoy it too.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:10.330
When such a ego is bloated within us, we cannot
understand what we are doing.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.850
People can befool you like that.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:25.630
It’s very easy to befool a person who is
ego-oriented, than to befool a simple person.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:35.270
A simple-hearted man not, cannot be easily
befooled, because he’s not on a trip, you see.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:41.130
But those who are on a ego trip, you tell
them that this is the best way to go to hell

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.710
– they will be the first booking their seats.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:54.900
There will be a queue for it, and people would
be asking for it, “All right, if it is so, it’s good."

00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:00.610
That is how many gurus in this world have
come forward, have befooled you by telling

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:06.980
you that you will get these powers, those
powers, that will happen, this will happen.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.550
And they know how to pamper your ego.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:16.750
For example, they might say this is a world
organisation of spirituality, and you are

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:24.270
the head of the world organisation; and you
believe it.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:30.010
Ego means misappropriation.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:43.880
You believe in it because you think that “after
all I must be something, and I have done this, I have done that."

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:49.029
But actually what happens physically is then
when this balloon spreads on your head all

00:13:49.029 --> 00:14:01.150
over – the aura of the brain surrounds the
heart normally, normally; but when there is

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:09.529
ego problem, then ego surrounds the heart.

00:14:09.529 --> 00:14:14.460
And when ego surrounds the heart, the brain
is cut off from the heart.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:22.290
So you are a non-integrated person, or we
can say disintegrated.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:33.450
Your heart runs one side, your brain runs
another side, your body runs third side, your emotions run fourth side.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:39.620
So four people running four horses, and that’s
how you are completely torn.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:51.330
I mean, it’s impossible to stand on two
stools, but if there are four with two legs, it’s a big feat to exist.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:15:04.580
So this kind of ego trip comes in, by which
you start behaving and living in this world

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.580
in a very unnatural way.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:14.230
And if somebody says that “No, not your
ego, not that.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.010
That’s not you.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.510
You have to be yourself.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.720
Ego is not yourself.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.500
Do not be satisfied with this ego,” then
you don’t like it.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:38.570
Because you are much higher than ego, much
greater than ego, much more than what you

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.070
think your ego can do.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.750
With ego what, at the most what can you do,
say?

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.960
At the most what can you do with your ego?

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:57.370
What people have achieved through ego?

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.430
Nothing.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.520
Whatever they have discovered even in the
sciences has come from the unknown, from God’s

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.940
own treasures.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:14.230
If God has given you some knowledge of the
unknown, you should not feel pampered about

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.890
it and think that “Oh, this is what we have
found."

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:29.210
No, He graciously gave you this knowledge
which has come to you, so just take it with humility.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:35.970
And this ego is very, very dangerous for Kundalini
awakening.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:41.940
Now you look at the diagram, imagine the whole
of your head is covered with that yellow stuff,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.800
and this blue thing becomes a very small one.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:54.760
So first of all the desire to seek, itself,
is diminished.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:04.080
You see, you go for seeking as if you are
going to a cinema hall.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:10.549
There is no combination of what you are thinking
and your heart.

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:14.120
You are not seeking from your heart, you are
seeking just with your brains.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:20.329
Because you have read three, four books, there’s
a fashion, everybody is seeking, everybody

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:25.879
is looking as if they are seeking something,
so let us also seek.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:35.020
It is not coming from your heart, because
you can see that the activity of heart has become practically zero.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:42.139
You do not desire anything, it is what your
ego desires you run after.

00:17:42.139 --> 00:17:47.279
Anything that doesn’t satisfy your ego,
you get upset about it.

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:53.470
One must go on all the time saying that you
are the fastest horse, you are the greatest

00:17:53.470 --> 00:18:03.200
person, you are the most unique personality,
then only you are satisfied.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.000
It cuts you out so much from your heart.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.200
That’s why we cannot find joy, because joy
you can only get through your heart. But this Mr.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:24.080
Ego gives you some sort of a satisfaction
which is very superficial, temporary, leads you nowhere.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:34.809
With this ego-orientation only you get so
many diseases, as I have told you before,

00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:51.809
like diabetes, heart attack, we can say also
cancer could be one of them, arthritis you might get.

00:18:51.809 --> 00:19:04.070
You also get with this too much thinking,
paralysis, paralysis is because of that, and kidney failures.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.770
The worst is liver.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:14.980
Because of over activity, liver is neglected.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.059
We are least bothered about the liver.

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:24.580
If you tell a child “don’t eat chocolates”
in childhood – I mean, it’s an impossibility,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.840
you cannot talk like that.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.190
I mean, I just once said that why not stop
giving chocolates to children, who cannot

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:38.320
digest it because their liver is not that;
or make something that is digestible to their

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.460
liver from childhood, till they grow up.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:50.350
And why not dilute the chocolates also a little
bit more?

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:56.309
So the question comes in then, that “How
can you do it, Mother?

00:19:56.309 --> 00:20:02.279
It would be chucking out everything, and children
would protest without chocolates."

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:08.799
Gradually they’ll forget.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:12.269
The liver problem starts within you.

00:20:12.269 --> 00:20:22.250
You become thin, lean, pale, aggressive, all
the time grumbling, grudging, sulking; never

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:27.340
in joy, never in happiness.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:37.910
You call it tension, stress, all these things
– it’s nothing but over activity of this chakra.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:44.619
Tension is because the whole of it is covered
with this balloon, and the balloon is still

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:47.559
going on and on and on.

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:51.070
That has to reduce.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:21:07.239
Sahaja Yoga is the only way really we can
face our ego, because through Sahaja Yoga only we can see ourselves.

00:21:07.239 --> 00:21:15.759
But it is an impossibility with human beings
to face themselves, even after realisation they find it difficult.

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:25.759
For example, all our misidentifications are
there.

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:28.340
Say I’m dealing, say, with English disciples
here.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:35.249
Before I start saying about the misidentification
of the English, I must condemn all the Indians

00:21:35.249 --> 00:21:42.830
of the world, and all the Japanese, Chinese,
Greeks, everybody else, and then I should

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:48.250
say, “There’s also something wrong with
English."

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.230
Otherwise I had it!

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:59.669
Unless and until at every stage I condemn
all the rest of the world, I cannot talk of

00:21:59.669 --> 00:22:05.970
saying that we also have certain misidentifications
which are sitting on our heads, by which we

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:15.909
are oppressed; we think that this is the correct
way of life; by which we have oppressed others.

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:20.289
And this ego business is so much prevalent
in our society.

00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:24.120
Now, with all due apologies, I am talking
about the Western society.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:31.220
When it comes to India I talk to them, but
now I’m talking to you and think that I am also a Western person.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.570
So I can see certain things as a Western personality.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.559
I don’t feel bad about it.

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:41.830
For in the so-called certain traditions that
we have – today only I was discussing, you

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.749
see – like on the table we have to sit for
dinner.

00:22:44.749 --> 00:22:49.149
All right, simple thing it is to sit on the
table for dinner.

00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:56.740
Now dinner is there because God has been gracious
to us; for our well-being, for our friendship

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.389
we are all going to sit down.

00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:04.821
But go to any formal dinner or you arrange
a formal dinner, people would sit down, ten

00:23:04.821 --> 00:23:14.739
times discussing where is the seat of X and
the seat of Y and the seat of Z.

00:23:14.739 --> 00:23:22.889
But if there is a slightest mistake in placing
the people according to their date of birth,

00:23:22.889 --> 00:23:31.039
their face colour, their head colour, their
height, their noses, their length, their upper

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:36.659
lips; any difference is there found in the
“Who’s Who” book, you see, that somebody

00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:39.879
was placed little higher in M.A.D.

00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:44.730
degree – then you had it!

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:50.440
All the good wishes of entertaining people,
of doing some good friendship, of having,

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:56.460
creating something very, very great is all
lost.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:04.960
All the effort is lost, and you are left wondering,
“Now what have I done?

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.499
I did consult all the dictionaries and the
‘Who’s Who.'”

00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:12.460
I mean, this “Who’s Who” is another
ego-pampering, you know.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:18.950
But despite that there was a mistake somehow,
and the person has taken a very big objection that Mr.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:26.409
X, who is one day junior to him, has been
made to sit ahead of him.

00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:31.299
It’s the greatest calamity to his ego.

00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:39.220
The poor chairs do not know what happens for
their different shapes, you see!

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:47.419
How much we fight over all such things, pampering
our ego.

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:50.429
So on and so forth, we have so many things.

00:24:50.429 --> 00:24:54.399
But if I say “Scrap all this nonsense,”
why don’t you scrap it?

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:59.299
Why to have all this, protocols, this, that?

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:03.239
What is the need to have this seat for this
gentleman, that seat?

00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:07.269
After all, if there are ten people for dinner
they can find their seats, there won’t be

00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:08.759
a chaos for ten people.

00:25:08.759 --> 00:25:13.889
Even for twenty people, even for three hundred.

00:25:13.889 --> 00:25:15.350
Why should there be seat allotted?

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:20.809
If you have invited three hundred people,
all right, they’ll all sit down.

00:25:20.809 --> 00:25:24.779
If they are remaining they’ll sit down for
the second one or for the third one.

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:33.919
What is the, such a hurry of having that program
altogether, or in such a systematic way that

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:41.409
everybody feels unsystematic after that, everybody
feels disturbed and upset after the program is over?

00:25:41.409 --> 00:25:47.470
With all the system, with all the corrections
and with all the great planning we do, ultimately

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.789
we find all have become nitwits.

00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:54.120
There must be something wrong about it.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.749
And it becomes a frenzy, with mob-like behaviour
people have, you see.

00:25:59.749 --> 00:26:05.700
Everybody will come out with very big faces,
“Oh, what a mismanagement, you know, they did this."

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.240
What is it?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.440
One can’t even understand what is the value
of these things.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.600
That’s why we have to be like small children.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:20.360
To them it does not matter where they sit.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:30.799
And so we are grown-up and matured, supposed
to be mature people also; while children are

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:34.929
still innocent and still ignorant, and still
they have to grow up.

00:26:34.929 --> 00:26:38.960
We are supposed to be up-grown: what has grown
within us is nothing but this Mr.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.940
Ego, not you.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:54.049
When this happens, when this happens in the
worst possible way – you know, today’s

00:26:54.049 --> 00:27:00.039
paper I was reading about this Ripper.

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:07.409
Now the conclusion is reached that he’s
not a psychopath, but he is on an ego trip.

00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:16.740
He’s doing all this for his ego satisfaction,
because he telephones to the police, he sends

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:22.679
a, what you call a tape to the police that
he should be caught.

00:27:22.679 --> 00:27:27.059
He tells them “You’ll meet me here,”
and still they cannot catch him.

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:32.750
So he thinks, oh, he’s such a great person
that nobody can catch him, the greatest thief

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.129
ever born who could not be caught.

00:27:36.129 --> 00:27:44.210
So that is what you call – he’s not a
psychopath, but I don’t know what name will

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.259
you give to such a man.

00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:52.419
I mean to a egoist like this, the one who
lives by ego, tries to satisfy his ego, and

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:56.559
if his ego is not satisfied by something,
he doesn’t feel satisfied.

00:27:56.559 --> 00:28:00.809
I don’t know what should you call him.

00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:04.289
Now, how to overcome this ego?

00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:08.789
Because people start seeing gradually this:
it happens.

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:10.720
They start seeing Mr.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:15.739
Ego, “Oh, very great, you see it’s coming
up, giving me ideas, all right."

00:28:15.739 --> 00:28:18.799
You feel sometimes very depressed with the
idea that this is Mr.

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.669
Ego I was identified with.

00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:21.669
All right?

00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:24.249
You see your ego.

00:28:24.249 --> 00:28:27.899
Then when you see your ego, then what do you
do with it?

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:32.450
Or if somebody says “Better watch your ego,”
then what happens?

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.830
You start fighting it.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.320
You say, “No, I will not say anything, I’ll
just keep quiet.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.249
Let them say anything, whatever they like."

00:28:42.249 --> 00:28:46.340
Then you’ll become another type.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.479
You become a person who is suffering from
superego.

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:58.910
So you are left with desires, but do not act,
and you’d say that “Let others aggress

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.929
me, I’m not going to aggress anyone.

00:29:00.929 --> 00:29:03.019
I’ll be very careful about non-aggression."

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:09.639
But by this kind of a thing, what happens
that when you raise the left side – I mean,

00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:15.669
left side which goes up on the right-hand
side, superego, it presses the ego down but

00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:23.210
again is bounced back, and there’s a kind
of a bouncing going on.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:28.820
By this behaviour when you fight your ego,
the ego sits on your head much more.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.179
The more you try to fight ego, it sits on
your head.

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:38.710
You are not to fight it.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.440
Supposing you take a balloon and start hitting
it, it will hit you back further.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.309
Go on hitting it, it will go on hitting.

00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:53.299
Now, which is the way to deflate this ego?

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:54.690
How do we deflate a balloon?

00:29:54.690 --> 00:30:02.419
In the same manner, take a pin and give it
a prick.

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:04.509
You just look at yourself, say, “All right,
Mr.

00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:12.830
So-and-so, now how do you do?” and you laugh
at yourself.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:20.150
You said, “Oh, you were very unhappy, you
see, when you saw that you were not placed very much.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:27.450
All right, now have a pin from me!”

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:34.690
And that’s how you deflate it, by seeing
it, by all the time making fun of it yourself,

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:41.600
and piercing a pin into it.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.989
Not by deflating, in the way people say that
you deflate the whole thing by pushing it

00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:58.251
down or by killing it, but actually just making
a hole in it.

00:30:58.251 --> 00:31:07.849
In the same way, if you start looking at yourself,
and make fun.

00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:13.869
Human beings only know very well how to make
fun of themselves.

00:31:13.869 --> 00:31:19.169
No animals know that.

00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:25.059
If you learn how to make fun of yourself,
your ego will go down.

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:28.769
Otherwise this ego will suggest whatever you
are doing is the best, “This has to be done,

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:29.769
that has to be done.

00:31:29.769 --> 00:31:31.629
I am the best, I am doing everything good."

00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:36.389
And you might be torturing someone, aggressing
someone, you might be just playing into the

00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:40.389
hands of ego like a madcap.

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:45.350
And you might be a real madcap, but you don’t
know that you are.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:53.649
Because with ego a person becomes successful,
so-called, he becomes very brilliant, shines

00:31:53.649 --> 00:32:01.960
out, in competition he comes up; and nobody
dare say a word to him, otherwise he’ll

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.890
have punch on the nose, you see.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:14.860
So also he becomes very mighty and powerful,
and everybody hankers after such a behaviour and such a thing.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:23.309
But a time comes when he realises that “I
was hanging in the air.

00:32:23.309 --> 00:32:34.440
I forgot my basis, and now I have to come
down,” like Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.659
and they had a great fall.

00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:42.029
Such a beautiful … this thing is, written
long time back.

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:52.330
And all the men … all the king’s horses
and all the men could not put Humpty Dumpty

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:56.679
back again into its own shape, you see?

00:32:56.679 --> 00:33:05.710
So don’t be Humpty Dumpty, and don’t live
with that idea of being a Humpty Dumpty.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:12.100
Is a simple thing to fight your ego.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:18.609
And that happens very often in Sahaja Yoga,
is a very common happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:33:18.609 --> 00:33:25.899
where your Kundalini itself, you see, creates
such situations that you are flabbergasted at your ego.

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:36.539
You don’t have to judge others, just see
yourself, because it is for your own good.

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:39.980
If somebody is egoistical it makes no difference
to you.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.070
Or non-egoistical, makes no difference.

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:49.980
Only thing is, you should really see for yourself
what is good and what is bad.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.419
That’s how it works out.

00:33:52.419 --> 00:33:56.879
Otherwise, as I always say that when I give
a lecture immediately we start thinking of

00:33:56.879 --> 00:33:58.529
somebody whom we think to be egoistical.

00:33:58.529 --> 00:34:03.470
Actually I’m saying to each one of you to
see it, would be a better idea.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:12.490
Now this ego when it covers your entire head,
the complete Sahastrara which is shown there,

00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:16.080
the white area gets covered.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:23.000
Your brahmarandhra, the portion from where
the Kundalini has to pierce also gets covered.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.190
It’s very difficult, the whole thing is
covered and this is small here, the gap is here.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.540
Now you cannot open the gap here.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.800
You have to open the gap here.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:41.870
So this has to go back like that, and this
has to come up in the centre like that.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:47.100
Then only Kundalini can come up.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:55.650
So what happens at such stage, you will find
such people have a left hand very weak, and right hand throbbing.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:01.830
So you raise their left, put to the right
side.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:05.750
Again raise their left put to the right, again
raise their left put to the right, so you

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:10.970
bring down the ego like this.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:24.321
And once the ego comes down, then this comes
up and the gap comes in between, and then

00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:26.800
you raise the Kundalini in the centre.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:35.200
Kundalini will come out, and then you tie
it up.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.530
This is Shri Vidya.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:41.950
This is the knowledge of Shri, of the Holy
Spirit.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:52.540
All other knowledge of where you have to sit
in protocol, what you are, is all avidya and nonsense.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:36:02.100
Reading “Who’s Who” I don’t know what
you will become, monsters or maybe some sort

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:11.180
of a Frankenstein-style personality.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:20.820
This is the vidya, Shri Vidya is the secret
vidya of the Holy Ghost, by which you balance

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:33.980
your ego with superego, your desire and action
should be equal; and then raise the Kundalini, put it up and tie it up.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:49.780
All these days people who been realised souls,
great people, have tried to point out the

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.960
problems of ego, have talked to you.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:37:04.580
They said, you shouldn’t have ego; ego is
the worst thing, one should not be identified with ego, and all that.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.160
And as soon as they have said it people have
started just finding out how to do it, and

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:16.720
in doing so they have become great “gurus”
– themselves egoistical.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:25.010
The fact is, you do not do anything.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:33.570
This is not ego, but is a mirage of ego that
you have got.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:39.430
You really do not do anything – everything
is done by God.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.810
He is the Doer, He has the great Ego.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:53.320
Your ego is just a copy, made artificially.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:59.690
Like He creates the flowers, and you make
plastic flowers and say, “Oh, we have created flowers."

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.410
He does everything.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:10.540
It is He who expresses His ego, while you
feel you have done something.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:17.160
It happens to you when you get realisation,
when your Kundalini pierces the brahmarandhra,

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.570
then you find the power flowing through you.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:24.540
And when you put your hands at somebody you
find the Kundalini rising there, and then

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:30.780
you find that you can feel the centres of
that person and catching of his centres, and you’re amazed.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.780
You said, “Mother, how is it?

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.320
Just now was nothing, suddenly what has happened
to me?”

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:46.030
Because your ego has subsided and has become
one with that of God, and you are giving vent to that power of God.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:52.731
You are playing the role of an instrument,
of a hollow personality, and through you is

00:38:52.731 --> 00:38:57.950
passing the power of God which is doing the
real work, while you are thinking “I’m

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.630
doing it,” without getting realisation.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.920
But after realisation you just feel, “Oh,
it’s flowing through me.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:17.650
I can see it flowing, I can see it working,
it is …” You’d start talking in third person, you don’t say “I."

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.150
You just say, “It’s going, it’s coming,
it’s not there.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.280
This is catching, that is catching."

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.140
It is in the third person you talk.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.500
You do not say “I am catching."

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:36.420
You do not say also that “I have risen the
Kundalini,” you say “The Kundalini has risen."

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.240
Who has risen it?

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.410
You never say that you have raised the Kundalini.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.840
You just say, “The Kundalini has risen.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.070
It is not coming up.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:53.370
It’s just going there,” as if you have
become an instrument of some power which is flowing through you.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:40:06.160
And this is how we become one with that, and
all our karmas dissolve into akarma.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:11.160
Karmas are only the effect of our false idea
of our ego.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:18.680
When there is no ego, where are the karmas
going to be?

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:23.200
If there is no one who is doing and the doer
is lost, then who’s going to do the karmas,

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:31.500
and who’s going to take the load of the
karmas upon themselves?

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:39.220
Like when there is an organisation, then it
says, “I have got assets and I have got

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.760
these debts, and these are the things,”
you see.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:52.780
But the association or that organisation disappears,
then who has the debt?

00:40:52.780 --> 00:41:02.560
In the same way, you as ego disappear, and
there is no effect of your karmas – all finished.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.600
All that was when one Mr.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.610
Ego was there.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:08.610
When Mr.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.130
Ego has gone, all liabilities have gone with
him.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.070
We are something different now.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:19.670
Now we have become the Self, the Atma.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:32.490
And when we have become the Atma, then we
are one with that Universal Being, and He

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.700
is making us do everything.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:45.880
Like My fingers don’t have ego that I’m
doing something and I’m touching the thumb,

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.060
because it is a part of this body.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:55.600
Our nose does not have an ego that it is something
special which is breathing.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.770
We say “I breathe,” we don’t say “this
nose breathes."

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:07.250
Neither the nose would say this mouth with
which we eat food, it never says that this,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.450
“I eat because of my mouth."

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:19.370
When you become one with that whole, then
you just feel that the whole is working and

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:30.930
we as part are working with it; and all the
responsibilities are finished.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:40.850
This is a little talk about ego today, because
I felt I should tell you that in Kundalini

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:49.740
awakening so far in the West, we have always
faced this problem of ego.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:57.170
Also of superego; those who have been to the
gurus have been possessed by their gurus.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:07.290
And these come as a relief to ego-oriented
society, because you have been, a horse has

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:14.150
been running, all right, and you have been
running on the horse.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:20.780
So somebody comes and says, “All right,
now, I’ll tie you up to the stomach of the

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.140
horse and I’ll be sitting on the horse myself."

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.720
This is the possession part of it.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:35.750
So you feel relieved, you know, quite relieved:
after all, you don’t have to ride the horse, you don’t have to jump.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:41.040
And the rider becomes somebody else, you see,
you feel also that there’s no responsibility, the rider is doing it.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:50.530
But after some time under the belly of the
horse, you start having all kinds of physical problems.

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:55.190
With superego you have physical problems.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:44:01.130
That’s why is better to have superego than
to have ego, because you know you don’t

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.410
want to have any more of physical problems.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.940
But if you have ego you never get physical
problems, or physically you may improve; you

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:13.310
know, you feel very fine, on top of the world,
you see.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.650
That is the biggest problem.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:22.340
But you get mental problems: you can’t sleep,
you go on thinking, thinking like mad, you cannot stop thinking.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.000
You go on arguing that it should be done.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.760
You think that everybody should do your work,
while you are the most important person ever born.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:45.980
So we have only one choice left, is to be
in the centre, to watch your ego and superego.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:53.830
For all the Sahaja yogis who are realised
have to watch themselves, not others.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:59.710
You should not expect anything of others,
just expect something of yourself for a change.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:10.460
With ego you do that and expect something
of the others, in superego you do for others.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:23.430
But in Self-realisation you emit your Self
as joy, love and beauty.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:30.420
May God bless you all.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:38.230
Now, should we go in for vibrations and realisation?

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.460
Now for the new people I would request if
they can take out their socks it would be

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.090
even better, they’ll be freer.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:50.400
Put both the feet on the ground, and sit in
a most relaxed manner.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.910
Now as you must have understood, it is a happening.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:05.290
You cannot force it down, you cannot work
it out, it has to happen to you.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:10.260
So no effort is to be put in, nothing.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.890
You just leave it, it works.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:20.660
Put your hands just like this, in a very relaxed
manner.

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:29.340
Even for Sahaja yogis it is very important
that they should go on exposing themselves

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:41.830
more and more to divine Power.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:55.320
And then when the Kundalini pierces the fontanel,
you’ll immediately start feeling the cool

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.960
vibrations in your hand.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.270
But it happens in many various stages in many
people.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:12.150
For example, some people may not even get
the rising of the Kundalini at all – some people, very few.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:17.350
With some people it rises halfway, again falls
down.

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:26.560
With some people it gets caught up in different
chakras, centres which are not all right.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.510
With some people there may be physical problem,
so you might feel some heat coming out.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:40.860
Specially with liver you get the heat coming
out, lot of heat is there with the liver.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:45.840
And with some people it could be very cold.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.110
Both things are not all right: you have to
be in the centre.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:59.280
If you start feeling any cool in the hand,
then it’s perfectly all right.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.720
But if there is, say, a hot coming in the
hand, doesn’t matter, you can just throw

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:08.490
it away and it will work out, in case it is
hot.

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:16.330
But if there is trembling in your eyelids
when you close your eyes, then please open your eyes.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:24.410
Kundalini moves up in everybody, it works
in everyone; only thing, it has reactions

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:30.040
according to the person who is facing it.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:35.730
So if there is any reaction, or if the Kundalini
doesn’t rise, there’s nothing to feel bad or argue about it.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:41.280
By argument if I could do, I would take you
to courts and argue there things.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:46.400
But by argument I cannot do it, you see, it
has to happen in you.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:52.070
I’m anxious that it should happen, in the
same way you should be also anxious that it should happen to you.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:56.380
There cannot be argument about it, you see
– it’s a happening.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.480
How can you argue about the sprouting of a
seed?

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.400
If it does not, you cannot argue with it,
you see?

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.400
It has to sprout.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.790
It’s as simple as that.

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:12.530
If it is not sprouting there’s something
wrong, all right?

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:18.250
Then those people who are realised who know
this, those who know Shri Vidya know how to

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:23.570
raise it, and raise your Kundalini, tie it
up and all that.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.600
But even that, people have objection.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:31.200
They don’t mind becoming naked and dancing
and doing all sorts of nonsense, but if somebody

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:38.080
raises the Kundalini and ties it up, they
don’t like it.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.600
There is nothing to be afraid of Kundalini.

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.020
Somebody told Me the other day that English
people are very afraid of “Kundalini” word.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:49.130
Now some English people who went to India
came by the back door, I believe, met all

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:55.760
kinds of horrid people who had no right to
talk of Kundalini, who were unholy people,

00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:00.370
unrighteous people: naturally they had very
bad experiences about Kundalini.

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:09.381
As I say that some villager comes and puts
his fingers into the, into the holes of two

00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:13.200
plugs and says that electricity is a horrible
experience.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.820
In the same way it might have happened to
many, but there’s nothing to be frightened of.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:25.430
It works out very well, and it gives you what
you are asking for.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.570
She is your Mother, eternally your Mother.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.170
She loves you the most than anybody can love.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.830
She’s not going to give you any trouble.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:38.710
She’s just waiting for you to have your
second birth.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:47.450
So there’s nothing to be frightened of anyone.

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:49.730
And also about gurus, you shouldn’t quarrel
with Me.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:54.880
If your guru is all right, I will Myself write
a nice letter to him.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.760
But if he is not all right, he has ruined
your Kundalini, he’s ruined your Agya, he’s

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:06.370
ruined your chakras, then I have to tell you
that something wrong with the fellow, because you do not know.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:12.040
Supposing there’s a policeman, he comes
to your house and he says there has been a thief in your house.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.910
Do you get angry with the policeman?

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:21.700
In the same way you should not be angry with
Me, because if your guru is a real guru, satguru,

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:27.140
then I would really worship that man, I’ll
be really happy; but I have yet to come across

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.100
– they are very few, very, very few.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.240
So what’s the use of being identified with
your guru?

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.580
He never gave you your powers, he was just
showing off his own powers, and was promising

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:42.911
you that today you’ll become a frog, tomorrow
you’ll become a bird and third day you’ll

00:51:42.911 --> 00:51:44.690
become a fish, and then amoeba, I think.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:50.360
You’ll end up as amoeba, I believe!

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.440
[Comment from a yogini]

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.630
Otherwise they – she’s saying, another
thing they can tell you: if they don’t give

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:02.530
you anything, they’ve taken away all your
money and everything, that you must, you see,

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:07.100
you must detach yourself from your money,
your family, “Send your wife over to me,

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.430
I’ll look after your wife, you be detached,
you see.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:13.620
Give me all your money, everything very nicely”
– still she’s saying that.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.930
Then also you say that “Still, sir, I have
given you everything, still I haven’t got it."

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:19.200
So they’ll say, “Now you go to Himalayas.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.340
Otherwise that’s the reason, you’d better
go to Himalayas.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.820
Give me your palatial building, I’ll live
here very nicely.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:31.120
Give all the money that you have, and you
go to the Himalayas.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.790
And you’ll be an unmarried man, that’s
a better, you’d better divorce your wife.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:36.460
You see, she’s the one who is standing in
your way."

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.560
And he sends you to Himalayas to freeze there
and to die.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.230
[Yogini comments further]

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:47.270
She says, “Where is the pure person?” ….

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:55.620
She says, “Among ten thousand, You are the
only one."

00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:07.800
No – even if they are not pure, they should
not be sinister.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:11.930
You are much greater people than they are,
because you are not realised, you do not propagate

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:15.790
anything, you do not preach anything.

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.800
These are not realised, nothing, they have
no authority.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.980
They have nicely have their flags on and they
are collecting money.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:22.980
Fundraisers!

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.640
All right, put your hands towards Me again.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.230
Take out your sock, socks.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:31.300
Now, it’s all right.

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:37.850
Put both the feet like this, put your hands
like that.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:44.360
(You want some water?)

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:52.130
Close your eyes, please close your eyes.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:54:15.070
Now, the first thing that happens is if you
watch your thoughts, there is no thought in your mind.

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:19.420
That means it has crossed the Agya.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:29.150
Sahaja yogis must go in a chain.

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:38.560
All of you hold each other’s hands, all
of you each other’s hands you hold.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:45.840
Not you, not – the people who are realised
already, who are.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:55:03.710
You just hold each other’s hands, that’s
all.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:20.900
Put your hands like that, yes.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.320
Close your eyes please, all of you.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.320
Please close your eyes.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.800
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.800
No.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.760
Yes, close your eyes, it will work out.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:35.110
It has to work out, is the point.

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:42.290
It will work out, you just don’t worry.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:47.160
Some of the Sahaja yogis are getting more
on the right, I think, less on the left hand.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:56:00.030
Should put their left hand towards Me, right
hand up, in case such a situation is there.

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:02.890
Feeling something?

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:04.330
Hot.

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:08.630
It’s all right.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:14.360
(…) make straight, straight neck.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.660
Make it straight.

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:31.790
Not it will, backwards, just make it straightforward
(…) Those who have come for the first time,

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:35.650
those who are getting cool breeze raise your
hands.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:37.980
In the hand.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.620
If you are getting cool breeze in the hand.

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.620
Good.

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.770
Both the hands?

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.160
Very good.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.630
Please put down your hands.

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:51.820
Left, left, not right so much.

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:57.660
Right hand is the problem, what’s the problem?

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.850
Right hand is it?

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:03.020
Alright, where is your father?

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:08.860
Do you write to him quote often?

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:09.860
No?

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:15.620
Now you promise Me that you’ll go and write
to him a letter.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.620
Alright?

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.620
Just promise.

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.760
Put your left hand on here, yes, and now you
promise, put your right hand towards Me.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.840
What are these rings you are wearing?

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.560
Better take them out, is better thing.

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.410
Is to take them out for the time being.

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:36.340
And also your kala take it out for a while.

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:38.200
Just for five minutes.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:44.600
You are getting something cool in the hand?

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.010
Nothing so far?

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:50.450
This gentleman here, are you getting any cool?

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:54.740
There only, not in the fingers.

00:57:54.740 --> 00:58:01.750
It will work out, it will work out.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.920
What is he catching?

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.070
Just see.

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.380
Tell Me.

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.540
Vishuddhi.

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:12.160
You are smoking something?

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.790
Vishuddhi is very catching.

00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:22.570
Now can you take out?

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:28.350
No, it’s alright, forget it.

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:32.110
Forget it now, let’s see.

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:34.750
Alright, it’s alright (hindi).

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.070
That also.

00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:37.070
Accha.

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:39.360
Better cut it out.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.980
Alright, put your hands towards Me.

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:48.610
Put your hand, left hand, here.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.540
Since when are you getting this spasm?

00:58:51.540 --> 00:59:03.270
Since you have come to this country?

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:13.320
Alright, just push it like that.

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:21.690
Still Vishuddhi’s there, is it?

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:30.069
Just come here Marcus, come.

00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:34.040
Just work out his Vishuddhi.

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.140
(Sighs) This is his Agya and this and that.

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.540
Now, have you been to any guru or someone?

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:43.420
(Just Vishuddhi’s here… Vishuddhi..)

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:44.420
No?

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:56.230
For this, but not to any guru as such.

00:59:56.230 --> 01:00:04.830
She’s great, I tell you, she was teaching
Me, She was telling Me that Nabhis are catching

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:05.830
on both the sides.

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:09.850
And what about (…) what are the chakras
catching?

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:15.650
You’ve been to some guru?

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:17.980
No one.

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:22.620
Have you been smoking?

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.110
You too smoking.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:35.360
Are you alright?

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.550
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.620
Are you relaxed?

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:44.660
Keep your eyes shut, it’s the greatest thing
that can happen to anyone, just keep your

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660
eyes shut.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.280
What about you?

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:56.060
In both the hands you are now getting?

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:57.680
Both the hands?

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680
Nicely.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.680
Good.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.320
What’s your name?

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.240
What’s your name please?

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.240
Nick.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.620
What country you belong to?

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.620
Cyprus.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.000
Cyprus obviously (says something inaudible).

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.040
And this lady comes from what country?

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.750
England.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.450
Great.

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:23.320
From which part?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320
(Essex)

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.130
Very good.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:48.340
You have not gone to any guru or anyone I
believe.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.230
That’s good.

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:54.950
So what do you do?

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.900
You are a housewife?

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.900
(Lady: Psychology)

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:09.900
Still I must say you have maintained yourself
very well.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:24.619
Otherwise when the psychologists come here
I have such a problem with them.

01:02:24.619 --> 01:02:31.460
They are themselves suffering from psychology.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:45.610
(To a child) Yes, come here, come, come, come
to Me.

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:58.050
Let him feel the chakras which is catching.

01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:59.050
Are you better now?

01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:00.050
Not yet.

01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:01.119
Vishuddhi…

01:03:01.119 --> 01:03:04.530
Are you alright?

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.670
Freddy?

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:07.950
Getting it?

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.090
Good.

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.360
What’s it?

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.500
Left.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:17.390
Did you go to any guru?

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:18.820
No one.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.960
Smoking you also?

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.390
Not much.

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:29.520
Put your hands there and one hand outside,
just see.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:37.210
One hand outside like this.

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:39.090
Good.

01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.970
(Hindi)

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:42.860
Better.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:48.510
Vishuddhi is terrible.

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.390
Good.

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:54.380
Are you better now?

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.390
Starting.

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.410
Got it.

01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:59.430
Better now?

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.450
It’s improving.

01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:02.460
Yes.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:10.540
It will work out, it will work out.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:15.600
What have you been smoking?

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:22.550
Something wrong?

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:29.510
Hashish.

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:30.510
(…)

01:04:30.510 --> 01:05:00.580
He feels the vibrations (…) Heart.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:17.690
Now, Nabhi.

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:26.250
Left.

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.890
Now how is it?

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:34.170
How is your brother now Mark?

01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:39.450
He is out of intensive now?

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:42.030
Then it’s alright.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:43.330
Better.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:48.020
How do you find the gentleman sitting before
you, just see, here.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.900
And the lady there.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.340
They’re alright.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:06:01.840
Do you live in London?

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.590
Essex.

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:05.760
You have come all the way from Essex today?

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.580
Oh, I see.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.990
In this London university?

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:13.020
Oh I see, I see.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.440
Now, is better now?

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.720
This gentleman, are you better?

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.380
Anything whatsoever, nothing.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.830
Warm still.

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:30.940
Alright, let it pass out.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:34.600
What about him?

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.660
Much better now.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.340
Alright, good.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:42.540
Just see him, let’s try.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.900
Still left, left Vishuddhi.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.250
Left, here is left.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:59.460
You are the one who has really helped Me the
most of all, I tell you.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.910
So bring your friends also with you.

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:04.010
What about her?

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:10.090
He feels right heart, let’s help him.

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.700
[Yogi: Left Swadhishthan]

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:30.560
Go and ask him to ask the question about Shri
Rama.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:38.210
Are there new people?

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:43.680
Have they got realisation?

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.050
Warm.

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:55.830
Put the left to the right, you’ll be all
right.

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.600
Who’ll come, who..

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:05.090
These two are realised souls, aren’t they?

01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:23.779
So they must, they must come and see here,
you see, come and see things there, come along,

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:29.940
one or two, come along.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.859
Come along, come along.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:39.790
Put yourself into bandhan.

01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:55.130
(Shri Mataji laughs) Now come along, make
effort, yesterday you asked Me that – come

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.560
along, make some efforts now.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.270
With this gentleman first of all.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:08:59.400
Alright, try on her.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.839
She too had hashish so better try on somebody
else.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:04.930
Now you don’t do on that.

01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:05.930
What about you?

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:06.930
Come along.

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:07.930
What’s … Don, allow these people to work
on you.

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:09.200
Come along, you, come along there.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.260
Be careful Don.

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.271
Work on her, those people who have not had
hashish.

01:09:12.271 --> 01:09:22.030
Marcus had hashish (laughter, She laughs).

01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:36.160
Oh I see, so did you smoke cigarettes?

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.750
Ah, you too.

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:42.190
Cigarettes and hashish.

01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:44.480
What else?

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.779
That’s all?

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:51.500
No, you have been smoking cigarettes and hashish.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.810
Both you have smoked.

01:09:55.810 --> 01:10:04.220
Both have today also, before just coming before
here.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.920
Constantly.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:14.800
Alright, you put him left to the right, all
of you, come along.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.860
You’ll be alright.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.480
Once you’ll find your Self you won’t smoke,
at all.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:43.650
You’ll enjoy your Self (…) You all go
up to the, you see, this place.

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:59.960
(Yogi says that a female seeker’s father
died)

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:07.710
Tell her to tell her father… she has to
tell the father that he shouldn’t worry

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.450
about her.

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:25.460
Did you ask the question?

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:29.130
Now are you better?

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.300
Not feeling much in the hands.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.300
Alright.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.300
Still.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.060
Alright, just come, alright?

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:53.640
(Hindi. Then probably to a child) Sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.030
Yes?

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:56.410
Good.

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:57.410
Better now?

01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:01.060
Now rub My foot.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.270
Now let’s see.

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:06.590
Yes, rub it.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:09.900
Rub it hard.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.110
Really hard.

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:15.430
Rub it hard.

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:16.530
Hard.

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.850
With your fingers.

01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:20.950
Hard.

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:23.160
You too.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:43.520
Press with both the hands, press with both
the hands.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.640
Void is caught, catching, Void, Void catches
with this one, the left Void.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640
Ah!

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.330
Are you relaxing now?

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.540
(Seeker says yes)

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.010
Very well.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:59.440
(Seeker says he is feeling suspicious)

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:24.350
You are suspicious of?

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:34.610
(Seeker: And frightened)

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:38.510
Suspicious and?

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.480
(Seeker: And frightened)

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.480
Shri Mataji: Frightened of whom?

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.480
(Seeker: You)

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.480
Me?

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.480
Why?

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480
I am not as bad as hashish is!

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.480
Why are you frightened of Me?

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.480
(Seeker: I had another guru)

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.480
Who is he?

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480
(Maharaji)

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.480
Who’s Maharaji this… you were not suspicious
of him?

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:54.230
(I’m suspicious and over it)

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:59.800
That’s correct, that’s good, that’s
very good.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:05.370
(It’s good to be suspicious of everybody)

01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:06.960
No, no.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:16.690
You must know who is the right and who is
the wrong type.

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:18.220
If you are sensitive you will know yourself.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.580
What do you expect is to get your own powers,
isn’t it?

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:28.560
To become your Self, that’s what should
help you – not all other tricks of giving experiences and this and that.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.140
You have to become your Self.

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.140
Isn’t it?

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.630
Like all others said.

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:35.540
Now, there’s nothing to be suspicious about.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.460
I have not taken any money from you, nothing.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.590
Nothing selling here.

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:42.590
See?

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.590
Alright?

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:59.890
Now, you are asking for something great, something
Self-realisation I am talking about, no experiences,

01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:02.790
it’s self-realisation.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.240
Yes?

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:13.860
Now rub it on the Void, here.

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.860
(…)

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.510
Better now she?

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:21.400
Agya?

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:42.780
She’s never been to a guru she said.

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:48.550
You did some pranayama also?

01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:49.550
Pranayama?

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:50.550
Breathing?

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:51.550
(Breathing, yes)

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:53.250
(To a child) Just see, just see!

01:15:53.250 --> 01:16:06.970
Is he alright?

01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:07.970
Really?

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:09.870
Where is the problem?

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:10.870
Come, come, tell Me.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:11.870
(Sahaja Yogi: Sahastrara catching)

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:12.870
He said I’m doubting.

01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:13.870
Suspicious.

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:14.870
(Yogi: Sahastrara, heart)

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:15.870
Heart also.

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:16.870
Hold your breath.

01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:18.040
Good.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:33.380
Again hold your breath, hold your breath.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:48.720
(Yogi: The Sushumna has a hole…doesn’t
flow)

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.910
Hole?

01:16:50.910 --> 01:17:04.060
How long were you his disciple?

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:12.820
(Seeker: Four, five years)

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:24.520
And what did you get out of him?

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520
What did you get?

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520
Nothing.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.520
(I never mistrusted him. I still don’t completely mistrust him.)

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.520
You do not mistrust him.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:35.900
(No, because I don’t know if he has done
any harm and I don’t know if he does any harm)

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:39.270
He hasn’t said anything about hashish and
cigarettes and why you…

01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:46.230
(Yes, he said I shouldn’t, it’s since
when I was first his devotee I didn’t smoke).

01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:49.490
Now you started smoking after becoming his
devotee.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:53.170
So this is the achievement.

01:17:53.170 --> 01:18:03.810
See, if you have found your Self you enjoy
your Self so much, alright?

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:12.620
That you just don’t run away from your Self,
minimum of minimum, that should happen to you.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:17.320
(Yogi: Mooladhara.. And His Kundalini doesn’t move)

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.770
Doesn’t move?

01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:23.830
(No, I can’t feel any movement, sorry)

01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:24.830
See.

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:25.960
This Raktabija’s…
