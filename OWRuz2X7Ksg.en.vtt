WEBVTT

00:03.830 --> 00:08.720
It is a great pleasure for Me,

00:10.720 --> 00:12.770
greatest joy

00:13.710 --> 00:16.830
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

00:19.361 --> 00:21.770
for the Guru Puja.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.790
It’s very gratifying

00:27.234 --> 00:30.760
to think that there are so many,

00:31.369 --> 00:39.650
so many of you who are disciples.

00:47.810 --> 00:50.720
It was never expected

00:51.830 --> 00:54.650
that I’ll have so many,

00:55.290 --> 01:00.810
so many people following Me.

01:05.730 --> 01:15.810
It is being expected

01:18.670 --> 01:20.650
that you all will

01:22.690 --> 01:29.620
follow My message of Love.

01:32.840 --> 01:38.810
I do not have to say anything for Love.

01:41.690 --> 01:50.760
Love is absolute gift,

01:54.640 --> 02:01.620
gift of just feeling others.

02:04.620 --> 02:08.810
There is no talking about it,

02:09.690 --> 02:13.610
discussing about it, nothing;

02:14.610 --> 02:20.760
just you feel that Love.

02:24.760 --> 02:32.720
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

02:33.700 --> 02:36.610
but how can you have a heart?

02:37.760 --> 02:44.640
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

02:46.840 --> 02:55.780
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

02:57.620 --> 02:59.800
that you can feel that Love.

03:02.810 --> 03:08.840
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

03:10.620 --> 03:17.610
Love has its own qualities

03:18.830 --> 03:25.660
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.730
Its understanding is not in words,

03:30.670 --> 03:32.610
not in thought,

03:33.690 --> 03:36.610
but understands within.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.780
It can feel within,

03:45.610 --> 03:46.840
which is very important.

03:50.610 --> 03:52.780
This is the most important part

03:54.650 --> 03:56.720
one has to realize

03:58.750 --> 04:04.670
that Love you can only feel it.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.620
You cannot talk about it,

04:09.670 --> 04:11.750
you cannot show about it,

04:12.750 --> 04:15.840
but it is within and you can feel it.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.760
And that is why today

04:22.640 --> 04:30.720
is your celebration of the Guru.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.830
It’s the celebration where

04:38.800 --> 04:45.640
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.780
That feeling is within

04:53.700 --> 04:58.690
and only in within you can feel that.

04:59.800 --> 05:05.770
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

05:07.670 --> 05:11.840
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

05:12.830 --> 05:19.800
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.760
This you can have because

05:26.620 --> 05:29.840
it is just there.

05:30.810 --> 05:32.800
No one can give you,

05:33.840 --> 05:36.620
no one can sell it,

05:37.610 --> 05:41.700
no one can share it - it’s just there.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.640
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.830
It has nothing to do with others;

05:57.780 --> 06:01.810
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.640
It’s within yourself,

06:07.750 --> 06:09.620
this feeling,

06:10.640 --> 06:15.800
this depth is there which you enjoy.

06:22.740 --> 06:26.740
It is the capacity -

06:27.820 --> 06:32.690
every one has this, lots of it.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.830
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

06:39.630 --> 06:42.720
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

06:43.660 --> 06:54.680
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.760
Sea, you cannot say

06:58.680 --> 07:01.820
today is full and tomorrow is not.

07:02.740 --> 07:04.740
It is eternal.

07:05.760 --> 07:12.690
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

07:14.630 --> 07:21.790
You cannot measure it,

07:27.760 --> 07:30.660
it’s difficult.

07:32.850 --> 07:37.720
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

07:38.720 --> 07:49.740
and it shows your understanding,

07:51.660 --> 07:53.760
your understanding of Love,

07:54.690 --> 07:56.740
which has no words,

07:57.770 --> 07:59.760
which cannot explain;

08:00.770 --> 08:03.710
but by itself you will know

08:04.680 --> 08:08.740
that "I have this quality to love

08:09.660 --> 08:11.760
within myself

08:12.680 --> 08:17.770
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

08:18.760 --> 08:28.690
This is a very unique gift

08:29.850 --> 08:38.660
which only very few human beings have.

08:41.690 --> 08:46.770
Among animals also you find people who have love,

08:47.820 --> 08:52.660
but that love is not deep,

08:53.630 --> 08:56.630
that love has no meaning.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.710
It has some purpose maybe,

09:04.660 --> 09:06.840
but it is not human,

09:08.650 --> 09:12.790
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

09:13.790 --> 09:21.740
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.850
It is not easy to describe

09:28.800 --> 09:33.850
or explain Love in human words.

09:35.710 --> 09:39.660
This you can only feel within your Self.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.760
That is what, once you start feeling,

09:45.630 --> 09:50.760
you can feel who is your Guru,

09:52.710 --> 10:00.800
Whom do you think you are being taught

10:00.850 --> 10:08.660
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.760
All that is possible.

10:15.620 --> 10:16.850
Everything is possible,

10:17.690 --> 10:19.660
humanly possible,

10:19.770 --> 10:25.650
but to love and to enjoy Love

10:25.700 --> 10:28.680
is not so easy,

10:29.630 --> 10:33.730
unless and until you are immersed in it.

10:39.790 --> 10:42.620
It’s very gratifying,

10:42.800 --> 10:47.800
it is very lovable

10:49.650 --> 10:52.790
to see how people love each other

10:55.790 --> 11:03.850
and then this Love spreads.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.800
Love begets Love.

11:11.760 --> 11:19.620
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

11:20.630 --> 11:22.660
You need not tell anyone,

11:23.770 --> 11:25.820
you need not confess it,

11:26.630 --> 11:30.710
but it will spread.

11:31.740 --> 11:36.770
And this is what one has to learn,

11:38.720 --> 11:43.770
how to see that Love in other person.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.680
Somehow,

11:51.740 --> 11:56.750
we are here already in Love

11:57.740 --> 12:01.850
because of Sahaj happening.

12:02.830 --> 12:05.800
We all love

12:06.720 --> 12:08.750
and we enjoy love,

12:09.690 --> 12:11.710
shows on our faces

12:12.690 --> 12:14.850
that we are in Love;

12:15.820 --> 12:18.630
in our characters,

12:20.660 --> 12:22.640
in our lives,

12:22.830 --> 12:25.630
that we are in Love.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.660
What a thing,

12:28.810 --> 12:32.740
which is not very normal,

12:32.800 --> 12:34.850
becomes so normal

12:35.770 --> 12:38.690
and so easily available.

12:39.660 --> 12:42.750
It is a very big blessing

12:43.750 --> 12:45.850
that you are human beings

12:46.740 --> 12:52.700
and that this source of Love

12:53.740 --> 12:59.690
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

13:00.660 --> 13:04.850
It’s a very intricate situation

13:05.750 --> 13:09.660
which cannot be explained in words,

13:11.700 --> 13:15.670
only one can be in it

13:15.750 --> 13:17.780
and enjoy it.

13:20.690 --> 13:22.740
So today is the day

13:22.800 --> 13:28.830
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

13:31.690 --> 13:38.750
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

13:39.720 --> 13:46.670
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

13:47.610 --> 13:49.770
which somehow or other leads us.

13:50.770 --> 13:54.850
We are lead into that

13:55.750 --> 14:02.710
great line of understanding,

14:03.800 --> 14:07.690
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

14:07.800 --> 14:10.770
to any school for education.

14:11.670 --> 14:14.610
It is something so much within

14:14.780 --> 14:24.740
that it works and expresses itself,

14:25.630 --> 14:28.770
expresses like a light.

14:29.710 --> 14:33.660
Such people we can make out because

14:33.810 --> 14:36.690
they are fully enlightened.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.660
They have light

14:39.810 --> 14:42.630
and through that light they see

14:42.770 --> 14:44.700
the whole world,

14:44.830 --> 14:49.610
which is very innocent and simple for them.

14:57.640 --> 15:03.720
We have love for our children naturally,

15:04.640 --> 15:07.710
we have love for our parents naturally.

15:08.670 --> 15:12.610
We have love for some people;

15:12.740 --> 15:14.770
but that love is different

15:15.610 --> 15:18.690
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

15:19.830 --> 15:23.740
That has some connections,

15:24.610 --> 15:25.820
some meanings

15:26.660 --> 15:35.800
but this Love which is -

15:38.710 --> 15:43.740
cannot be described in words,

15:43.830 --> 15:46.720
has to be felt within.

15:49.690 --> 15:52.810
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

15:54.660 --> 15:58.850
you should have that Love within you.

16:01.610 --> 16:05.690
Why do you feel it so much?

16:08.800 --> 16:14.740
The reason is, Guru loves you

16:15.750 --> 16:17.800
and you love Guru;

16:18.740 --> 16:20.850
That’s the only reason

16:21.750 --> 16:24.720
why should you love your Guru.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.850
Now, there's no reason for that.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.660
Because Love is Love.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.670
and that is how

16:35.690 --> 16:39.850
the Guru becomes very important in life.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.630
We have people

16:43.830 --> 16:47.780
who love their Guru

16:49.690 --> 16:51.770
and are very much

16:53.800 --> 17:02.630
in chaste understanding of their Love.

17:04.740 --> 17:09.660
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

17:10.670 --> 17:16.770
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

17:17.740 --> 17:19.690
from our heart,

17:20.710 --> 17:26.770
that there is this ocean within us,

17:28.660 --> 17:32.640
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

17:32.770 --> 17:35.630
If we are lost in that ocean,

17:35.750 --> 17:39.770
then we’ll have no problems,

17:41.640 --> 17:43.690
no questions.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.740
Everything will be our own

17:48.720 --> 17:50.710
and we can manage

17:50.820 --> 17:55.710
everything without any argument,

17:55.780 --> 17:58.830
without any questioning.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.850
That is what is being Sahaj.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.640
The Sahaj way, if you have

18:08.770 --> 18:12.660
this Love, you enjoy.

18:12.780 --> 18:16.640
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

18:16.710 --> 18:18.820
because it is Sahaj.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.740
Don’t have to make any efforts,

18:22.610 --> 18:24.710
don’t have to try anything.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.820
Just it is there and it works.

18:33.690 --> 18:40.710
The feeling of Love

18:41.820 --> 18:47.720
has no way of expressing itself.

18:48.850 --> 18:51.690
It is just there,

18:52.640 --> 18:54.680
it cannot express,

18:55.820 --> 19:00.800
because it is without expression.

19:02.670 --> 19:07.830
It is just to be felt within yourself.

19:09.710 --> 19:12.820
Then you want to do so many things:

19:13.830 --> 19:16.660
you want to help everyone,

19:16.820 --> 19:19.660
you want to help yourself,

19:20.640 --> 19:24.770
you want to do good to others.

19:25.690 --> 19:30.800
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

19:31.660 --> 19:33.820
because they had that Love.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.610
They had nothing else but this Love

19:37.800 --> 19:41.750
which they could not contain them within themselves,

19:41.820 --> 19:45.850
so, they tried to spread it.

19:46.750 --> 19:50.770
And they are called now as our Guru,

19:51.690 --> 19:53.770
as our masters.

19:54.670 --> 19:56.810
With that Love within,

19:57.810 --> 20:03.850
which approached people in that unique manner.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.820
That’s the thing that

20:09.740 --> 20:11.810
we cannot possess,

20:12.660 --> 20:14.700
you cannot claim -

20:15.850 --> 20:17.850
it is there

20:18.810 --> 20:20.850
and it works,

20:22.670 --> 20:24.700
it works automatically.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.810
This is what we have to know,

20:29.620 --> 20:35.730
that we are that Love.

20:37.690 --> 20:38.810
That Love is within us.

20:39.630 --> 20:43.810
We have to have knowledge,

20:44.750 --> 20:48.670
we have to have a complete knowledge

20:48.800 --> 20:53.630
that we are that Love.

20:54.780 --> 20:57.770
That will solve our problem,

20:58.820 --> 21:00.780
because you can explain everything,

21:00.850 --> 21:02.780
all your behaviour,

21:03.720 --> 21:05.610
all your failures,

21:05.670 --> 21:07.820
everything you can explain

21:08.630 --> 21:13.640
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.780
This is what is the Guru

21:19.690 --> 21:22.640
is the Love within you

21:23.610 --> 21:24.850
which wants to share

21:25.720 --> 21:27.750
Love with others,

21:29.630 --> 21:32.820
which wants to give Love to others.

21:37.610 --> 21:42.670
This is what is peace and joy.

21:43.810 --> 21:46.780
I can go on talking on Love,

21:47.830 --> 21:51.780
but to feel it

21:54.620 --> 21:57.760
within yourself is the biggest thing.

21:58.810 --> 22:00.700
Like water:

22:00.840 --> 22:02.790
if you are thirsty,

22:03.700 --> 22:05.670
we can give you water,

22:05.850 --> 22:07.810
but we cannot drink.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.680
You have to drink water

22:10.780 --> 22:12.840
and you have to

22:15.740 --> 22:17.780
feel the taste,

22:18.700 --> 22:20.640
feel the feeling,

22:20.760 --> 22:22.710
what it does,

22:22.810 --> 22:26.850
and all that is together,

22:27.850 --> 22:30.710
that’s not separate.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.820
I don’t think the subject

22:33.620 --> 22:35.790
was too subtle for you people.

22:36.710 --> 22:39.710
You all have reached a certain amount

22:39.850 --> 22:42.820
of understanding of that Love.

22:44.780 --> 22:48.680
I hope, it grows

22:49.640 --> 22:51.730
and you grow into it,

22:51.840 --> 22:55.700
all of you, and enjoy it.

22:55.850 --> 22:58.750
May God bless you!
