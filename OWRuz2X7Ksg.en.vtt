00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.720
It is a great pleasure for Me,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.770
greatest joy

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.830
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.770
for the Guru Puja.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.790
It’s very gratifying

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.760
to think that there are so many,

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.650
so many of you who are disciples.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.720
It was never expected

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.650
that I’ll have so many,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.810
so many people following Me.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:15.810
It is being expected

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.650
that you all will

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.620
follow My message of Love.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.810
I do not have to say anything for Love.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:50.760
Love is absolute gift,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.620
gift of just feeling others.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.810
There is no talking about it,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.610
discussing about it, nothing;

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.760
just you feel that Love.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.720
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.610
but how can you have a heart?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.640
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.780
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.800
that you can feel that Love.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.840
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.610
Love has its own qualities

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.660
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.730
Its understanding is not in words,

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.610
not in thought,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.610
but understands within.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.780
It can feel within,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.840
which is very important.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.780
This is the most important part

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.720
one has to realize

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.670
that Love you can only feel it.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.620
You cannot talk about it,

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.750
you cannot show about it,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.840
but it is within and you can feel it.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.760
And that is why today

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.720
is your celebration of the Guru.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.830
It’s the celebration where

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.640
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.780
That feeling is within

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.690
and only in within you can feel that.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.770
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.840
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.800
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.760
This you can have because

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.840
it is just there.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.800
No one can give you,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.620
no one can sell it,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.700
no one can share it - it’s just there.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.640
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.830
It has nothing to do with others;

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.810
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.640
It’s within yourself,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.620
this feeling,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.800
this depth is there which you enjoy.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.740
It is the capacity -

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.690
every one has this, lots of it.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.830
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.720
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:54.680
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.760
Sea, you cannot say

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.820
today is full and tomorrow is not.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.740
It is eternal.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.690
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:21.790
You cannot measure it,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.660
it’s difficult.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.720
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:49.740
and it shows your understanding,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.760
your understanding of Love,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.740
which has no words,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.760
which cannot explain;

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.710
but by itself you will know

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.740
that "I have this quality to love

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.760
within myself

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.770
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:28.690
This is a very unique gift

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:38.660
which only very few human beings have.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.770
Among animals also you find people who have love,

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.660
but that love is not deep,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.630
that love has no meaning.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.710
It has some purpose maybe,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.840
but it is not human,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.790
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:21.740
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.850
It is not easy to describe

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.850
or explain Love in human words.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.660
This you can only feel within your Self.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.760
That is what, once you start feeling,

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.760
you can feel who is your Guru,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:10:00.800
Whom do you think you are being taught

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:08.660
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.760
All that is possible.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.850
Everything is possible,

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.660
humanly possible,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.650
but to love and to enjoy Love

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.680
is not so easy,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.730
unless and until you are immersed in it.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.620
It’s very gratifying,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.800
it is very lovable

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.790
to see how people love each other

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:03.850
and then this Love spreads.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.800
Love begets Love.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.620
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.660
You need not tell anyone,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.820
you need not confess it,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.710
but it will spread.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.770
And this is what one has to learn,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.770
how to see that Love in other person.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.680
Somehow,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.750
we are here already in Love

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.850
because of Sahaj happening.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.800
We all love

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.750
and we enjoy love,

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.710
shows on our faces

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.850
that we are in Love;

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.630
in our characters,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.640
in our lives,

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.630
that we are in Love.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.660
What a thing,

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.740
which is not very normal,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.850
becomes so normal

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.690
and so easily available.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.750
It is a very big blessing

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.850
that you are human beings

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:52.700
and that this source of Love

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:59.690
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.850
It’s a very intricate situation

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.660
which cannot be explained in words,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.670
only one can be in it

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.780
and enjoy it.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.740
So today is the day

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.830
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:38.750
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:46.670
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.770
which somehow or other leads us.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.850
We are lead into that

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:02.710
great line of understanding,

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.690
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.770
to any school for education.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.610
It is something so much within

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:24.740
that it works and expresses itself,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.770
expresses like a light.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.660
Such people we can make out because

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.690
they are fully enlightened.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.660
They have light

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.630
and through that light they see

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.700
the whole world,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.610
which is very innocent and simple for them.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:03.720
We have love for our children naturally,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.710
we have love for our parents naturally.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.610
We have love for some people;

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.770
but that love is different

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.690
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.740
That has some connections,

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.820
some meanings

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:35.800
but this Love which is -

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.740
cannot be described in words,

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.720
has to be felt within.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.810
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.850
you should have that Love within you.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.690
Why do you feel it so much?

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.740
The reason is, Guru loves you

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.800
and you love Guru;

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.850
That’s the only reason

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.720
why should you love your Guru.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.850
Now, there's no reason for that.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.660
Because Love is Love.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.670
and that is how

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.850
the Guru becomes very important in life.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.630
We have people

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.780
who love their Guru

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.770
and are very much

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:02.630
in chaste understanding of their Love.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.660
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:16.770
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.690
from our heart,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:26.770
that there is this ocean within us,

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.640
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.630
If we are lost in that ocean,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.770
then we’ll have no problems,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.690
no questions.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.740
Everything will be our own

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.710
and we can manage

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.710
everything without any argument,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.830
without any questioning.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.850
That is what is being Sahaj.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.640
The Sahaj way, if you have

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.660
this Love, you enjoy.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.640
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.820
because it is Sahaj.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.740
Don’t have to make any efforts,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.710
don’t have to try anything.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.820
Just it is there and it works.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:40.710
The feeling of Love

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:47.720
has no way of expressing itself.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.690
It is just there,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.680
it cannot express,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.800
because it is without expression.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.830
It is just to be felt within yourself.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.820
Then you want to do so many things:

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.660
you want to help everyone,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.660
you want to help yourself,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.770
you want to do good to others.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.800
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.820
because they had that Love.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.610
They had nothing else but this Love

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.750
which they could not contain them within themselves,

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.850
so, they tried to spread it.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.770
And they are called now as our Guru,

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.770
as our masters.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.810
With that Love within,

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:03.850
which approached people in that unique manner.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.820
That’s the thing that

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.810
we cannot possess,

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.700
you cannot claim -

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.850
it is there

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.850
and it works,

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.700
it works automatically.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.810
This is what we have to know,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:35.730
that we are that Love.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:38.810
That Love is within us.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.810
We have to have knowledge,

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.670
we have to have a complete knowledge

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.630
that we are that Love.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.770
That will solve our problem,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.780
because you can explain everything,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.780
all your behaviour,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.610
all your failures,

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.820
everything you can explain

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.640
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.780
This is what is the Guru

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.640
is the Love within you

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.850
which wants to share

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.750
Love with others,

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.820
which wants to give Love to others.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.670
This is what is peace and joy.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.780
I can go on talking on Love,

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.780
but to feel it

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.760
within yourself is the biggest thing.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.700
Like water:

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.790
if you are thirsty,

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.670
we can give you water,

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.810
but we cannot drink.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.680
You have to drink water

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.840
and you have to

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.780
feel the taste,

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.640
feel the feeling,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.710
what it does,

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.850
and all that is together,

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.710
that’s not separate.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.820
I don’t think the subject

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.790
was too subtle for you people.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.710
You all have reached a certain amount

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.820
of understanding of that Love.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.680
I hope, it grows

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.730
and you grow into it,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.700
all of you, and enjoy it.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.750
May God bless you!
