00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:16.040
Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate
the Diwali, that is dipavali, meaning the

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:30.970
rows of lights.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:53.089
In the darkness of Kali Yuga when you find
from every place confusion of the worst type

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:02.670
creating the darkness which cannot be penetrate
into, and which looks like a solid mountain

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:12.820
around us, and which can never be covered,
as we feel, by the grace of God.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.300
And even with the grace of God it would never
melt.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:37.340
In that darkness, in that hopeless state,
when the creation is on the verge of its destruction,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.700
the light of Sahaja Yoga has arrived.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.920
And you are the lights, you are the dipas,
you are the little, little lights, which were

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:02.710
waiting to be enlightened, to be enlightened
to see for yourself what’s wrong within

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.500
your own lamp, what’s missing in your own
lamp.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.190
Now, in the lamp you have three things, as
you see.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.661
One is the container.

00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:30.550
Container is this body, container is this
mind and the container is this intellect.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.320
And the container contains within us itself,
is the oil.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.280
In Sanskrit language it’s called snigdha
or sneha, means the love.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:53.740
Is the love that is within your mind, within
your body, within your existence itself.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:01.680
But this love is now limited, it is in a dormant
state.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.280
It doesn’t express itself, it can spill
out in wrong directions, it may spoil some

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.590
things, which are beautiful.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.120
This love, when it is limited, is very dangerous.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.760
But when there is a third thing within you,
which we call as the baati, is the wick.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.390
And this wick is the pure desire within you,
which is not yet lightened – it is not aware

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.950
of itself.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.790
Nobody is aware, the lamp is not aware that
there is a light within itself.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.710
All these three things have to combine to
give that light because we are lost in so

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.040
many things.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.080
This darkness of Kali Yuga is not one-sided.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:14.230
If you see it clearly it is not only materialism,
adherence to money, adherence to money-power,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.769
it’s not only that.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.160
That’s, of course, is very important these
days, we cannot neglect it, because that’s

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:32.470
something is really weighing this whole balance
of the Western world.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.040
But this money is for power.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.980
Why money?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.460
Because it has a power, according to many
people who are blind.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:53.440
They think money has the power to win-over
people, to exist in higher powers of, say,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.380
execution of their administration and all
that you need money.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.380
To win our votes, to get elected.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.840
That’s the myth people are carrying all
the time, that money is very important, and

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.200
without money you can’t manage things.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.460
And also because of this kind of a misunderstanding
about money people get very much impressed

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.540
by the people who have money, and they think,
“Now, this is the time we must really gather

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.500
money somehow or other.”

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.640
Try to get money out of every kind of a adharma.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.530
“What’s wrong?”

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.220
So this money orientation has gone in this
Kali Yuga to such a limit, that the sense

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.600
of chastity is lost, the sense of creativity
is lost – because you must create something

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.230
that must sell.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.780
If it cannot sell then you should not.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.570
Then, the sense of Dharma is lost, there is
no Dharma.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.419
When it comes to making money, what is the
Dharma?

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.560
There is no Dharma needed.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.710
Only Dharma is how to make money.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.340
Then, of course, the love.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.560
The mothers don’t want children because
they have to spend money on their children.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.340
It is the conceive, a selfishness that starts
working.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.570
And people start thinking about, “How we
can grab money from others?”

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.670
There are many sophisticated ways of grabbing
money also in the modern times.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.470
And the sophistication has reached such subtleties
that a person doesn’t know until he is completely

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.050
robbed.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:47.110
Now, there are other ways of getting money,
is now that the kind of a music nowadays people

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.040
are having – which is against God – it
doesn’t sing the praise of God, but it’s

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.680
just a noise that they make.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.280
If you sing the praise of God it’s different.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.730
But otherwise this kind of music that they
have, actually works on your limbic area.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:10.310
And the limbic area has the capacity to give
you joy and happiness, and this limbic area

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:17.480
becomes numb because of this music, of this
horrible music of modern times.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:25.330
When it becomes numb then what you do is to
have more noise and more noise and more noise,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:08:12.270
to give a sensation to the limbic area.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:19.320
So the limbic area when it becomes sensation-less
they don’t know how to give it a sensation,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.410
so they take to drugs, you have to take to
drugs, you can’t help it, because all the

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.580
sensation is lost.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:33.209
So, in the name of also anti-culture, or you
can call an anti-tradition, anti-this and

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:42.409
anti-that, what you develop is a limbic area
which requires sensations.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:48.980
Now the music fetches money, because it’s
like drug, it’s like any alcohol, it’s

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.629
any intoxication.

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:57.139
Because already the nerves are intoxicated.

00:08:57.139 --> 00:09:07.250
Even alcohol works the same way, even other
things like drugs also work the same way.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:12.850
So, in that intoxication you really do not
know what are you up to.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:20.779
A kind of another darkness, another blindness
comes over.

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:27.870
So in this darkness – this another additional
darkness makes people much more blind, much

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.279
more understanding.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:39.790
This then takes us to the problem of the body
that exists, of the mind that exists, of the

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.330
intellect that exists.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:51.019
When the whole thing is directed towards money-orientation
we put our body for sale.

00:09:51.019 --> 00:10:01.649
We want to make our body look like nothing
on earth, I could say, like some sort of a

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:07.910
tuberculosis patient as they say (Laughter),
or mosquitoes.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:13.959
Because that makes people have some pity I
think, but inside exists a terribly, a shrew

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:18.189
type of a temperament in a man or a woman.

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:24.189
The whole thing is done by entrepreneurs,
if you see that because they want to produce

00:10:24.189 --> 00:10:28.809
things and they want to create images by which
you have to live.

00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:35.689
And if you have to live with those images
you have to take to the kind of things they

00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:42.139
are producing and that’s how you try to
use those things and you become just a slave

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:43.209
to those entrepreneurs.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:51.540
It has gone too far – it has gone too far
into the production of things where you have

00:10:51.540 --> 00:11:01.459
to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:10.009
We have so many diseases in our country and
these diseases are very modern, meant only

00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:11.339
for modern men.

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:16.970
In the older days people didn’t know these
diseases – must be having one or two, but

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.329
not many.

00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:26.509
So these diseases also come out of the fact
that most of the things we eat or most of

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:35.660
the things we do are just the games of the
entrepreneurs.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:42.009
Nothing fresh, nothing genuine, nothing sensible
is produced.

00:11:42.009 --> 00:11:52.579
Wants are created that you must have at least
ten dresses, all made of pure plastic (Laughter)

00:11:52.579 --> 00:12:01.339
– which reacts, which reacts and which creates
problems.

00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:13.629
Then you should have all kinds of other materials,
which are absolutely harmless and are anti-human

00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:15.149
beings.

00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:20.220
All machinery is for us, we are not for machinery.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.230
So we have to give a balance.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:29.069
Whatever we need can be done through the machinery,
but when machinery becomes the only source

00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:32.249
of exploitation it starts dominating us.

00:12:32.249 --> 00:12:41.910
See, if you go to the darkness of this Kali
Yuga – it’s so deep, it’s so horrid

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:47.819
and it’s so dangerous and destructive that
the description of it can take you to any

00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:56.529
land and you will not even feel that you are
getting into the mire deep, deep, deep into

00:12:56.529 --> 00:13:03.809
it, that you cannot come out of it.

00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:15.440
So the antidote has come now as Sahaja Yoga
– the Diwali, the dipavali of the Sahaja

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.519
Yogis.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:21.829
See now, after Realization you don’t need
beauty-treatment much.

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:30.040
You don’t need so many plastic clothes (Laughter).

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:39.059
You don’t indulge into all kinds of stupid
activities which are joyless.

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:41.139
You don’t take to drugs.

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:43.009
You don’t take to smoking.

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:50.730
You don’t take to alcohols and you don’t
take to this horrid music also.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:59.800
On the contrary you take to the music that
pacifies, which sooths your limbic area, which

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.069
gives joy.

00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:09.870
So you indulge into all the pursuits which
will give you joy, start giving up gradually.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.620
Sometimes I have to tell you but then you
understand and you give up all those things

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.860
because then you have tasted the joy, you
know what this joy is, you know the ambrosia

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.339
of joy, so you don’t want to give it up.

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:26.040
You may, little bit, give it up, then again
you come back.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.189
You know this is joy.

00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:33.139
Joy doesn’t lie in money, doesn’t lie
in all these joyless pursuits, nothing, but

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:39.259
joy lies in your Spirit, and the Spirit is
the one that enjoys the joy.

00:14:39.259 --> 00:14:50.279
So, this Spirit is the one, which you see
burning at the end of your Kundalini – on

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.079
top of your Sahasrara.

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:57.929
And you have seen the photograph, on top of
your Sahasrara you see the beautiful flame

00:14:57.929 --> 00:14:59.829
burning.

00:14:59.829 --> 00:15:01.220
You have seen that photograph.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:08.360
It’s the proof that now you are all the
lights, and that you have to give lights to

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.050
others.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.749
You have to help people.

00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:17.079
Now, all your faces look like roses, anybody
can see you and can make out that you are

00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:18.559
something special people.

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:25.129
You are not like ordinary people who look
so miserable, horrible – and when you sing

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:32.240
in that style also, you are singing God’s
sake, in every style, whatever you sing, which

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.989
was once upon a time was regarded as anti-God
singing becomes something great.

00:15:38.989 --> 00:15:47.579
So now the light of Sahaja Yoga has kindled
within you all these small, small lights,

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:53.600
which are going to enlighten the path for
humanity, for their emancipation.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.790
So responsibility of Sahaja Yogis are great.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:03.799
They should get over all these limitations,
like the light has got over all the limitations

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:05.939
and spread all over.

00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:13.550
If you have a way of measuring how far this
little light has gone you cannot measure it

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.589
with ordinary human instruments.

00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:23.329
But once it starts it is spread to the last
bit of it and comes back to it.

00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:34.310
In the same way this light which is kindled
within you spreads all over, is emitted all

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.579
over and comes back to you.

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:42.859
But of course it is just a material light.

00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:45.319
This is a spiritual light.

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:51.569
The difference is this light has its own power
of burning, that’s all.

00:16:51.569 --> 00:16:57.359
Also it has a power of giving some light in
the darkness.

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:04.630
Also it has one more thing, that it can enlighten
another light.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:13.470
But a Sahaja Yogi is not only the light himself,
but also the one who can go to others.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.839
It cannot walk.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:20.010
When it walks it is fire.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.630
It cannot walk in it’s own limitations.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.589
Somebody has to carry it.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:31.610
So the Sahaja Yogis are the ones who can carry
this light within themselves – very well

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:37.760
preserved and very beautifully enlighten another
person.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.820
Without creating a fire, without burning anything.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.720
You move this from here to there one has to
think thrice if you can move because you may

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.290
spill something or you may burn something.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.940
But not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.950
And it is for the redemption.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:02.080
This can give you light, which is outside,
by which you can see only – but you cannot

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:08.019
feel and you cannot cure.

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:18.340
You cannot give counsel, nor can you comfort
and you cannot redeem with this material.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.570
It is spiritual light that is within us.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.029
So today is a celebration of real Diwali.

00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:35.410
I always say that in India we were producing
the Diwali-lights with ordinary mud, but now,

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:43.260
in Sahaja Yoga, we have lotuses which are
giving light, the fragrance.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:49.160
Such beautiful things they are and the way
you are enjoying it and expressing your joy

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.220
is so very beautiful.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:19:02.049
But to be the lotus you have to give up this
mud, this darkness – you have to give up

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:03.049
that.

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:13.580
If you can’t give up that, then you cannot
enjoy your own lotus and others can’t enjoy.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.130
So that giving-up is not difficult.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.310
You see, when people say that, “You have
to love your Mother”, just means that you

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.760
give up your ego and your conditionings and
become a pure personality, that’s all.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.769
I mean, in any case all of you love Me but
still under limitations.

00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:36.580
You must love Me without limitations, then
it is a real love as I love you.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.250
For this we have to thank this time.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.529
This time is great.

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:46.299
As I call it the blossom time, that at this
time you were all born and at this time I

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:52.210
came and at this time this combination took
place and at this time Sahaja Yoga was established.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.880
You don’t know, I have gone through very
great difficulties in the beginning.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.350
Very great difficulties.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.590
Because Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood by
idiots.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:08.490
And first I met only idiots in My life (Laughter),
quite a lot of idiots.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.570
As Christ has said, “The first will be the
last”, you see.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.899
Perhaps those idiots that I’ve met have
created lots of problems for Me.

00:20:15.899 --> 00:20:18.350
But then real people started coming to Me.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:24.860
They understood Sahaja Yoga, they took to
Sahaja Yog’ and it worked out very well.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.049
Now we have plans to go to India.

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:36.000
The speciality of Indian Tour is that India,
as you know, is a place of quite lot of work

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.220
done by the great saints, especially Maharashtra.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:46.970
Apart from that it’s a very, very Holy Land,
no doubt about it, it’s very clean.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.340
Still the people have not taken to materialism
to that extent.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:56.920
And thirdly we have about eight pujas in such
a short time.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.200
Of course, it is too much for Me, sometimes.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.030
But we have eight pujas, and this is something
so intensive, one can do it.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:11.049
This I can’t do anywhere else, as I can
do in India, because only in India the atmosphere,

00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:15.190
the vibrations are sucked in, much faster
they are sucked than anywhere.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.889
Because the darkness is not so much there,
and the light spreads much faster, much more

00:21:20.889 --> 00:21:25.020
easily, and I can find it easier to work it
out.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:30.140
I’m sure those days will come everywhere,
when you put up your lights and you start

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.320
working it out.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:39.330
I must congratulate all of you that you are
the ones, who are stuck-on to this darkness

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:45.980
and have created such a light with such responsibility,
with such understanding, with all the struggles

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:53.049
you had to go through, getting out of your
very limited basic problems.

00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:58.950
It is remarkable the way you people have established
it, it’s unbelievable, because, you see,

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:05.220
you could have just said that, “This is
some philosophy, we don’t believe it.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.669
This is something that we don’t understand.”

00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:12.960
But it’s so congenial to you, because you
have become the Spirit.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.440
Christ has said the same thing, but how many
have understood Christ?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.660
Nobody has understood Christ, I think, till
it came through Christianity.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.490
When it came through Sahaja Yoga you have
understood who He was.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:33.540
In the same way for all other great prophets,
all other great Incarnations, you had to come

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.870
to Sahaja Yoga, to see in that light how great
they were, how much work they have done for

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:43.220
us, how much they have established us, how
much we should be thankful to you.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:48.529
I hope one day you can see all of them sitting
with us and you can locate them, wherever

00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:49.669
they are.

00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:55.750
Those eyes you should develop one day, to
see all that, which your camera can see, sometimes.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.971
And in the same way you should be able to
see, it will be a very good idea.

00:22:58.971 --> 00:23:04.360
I think in Bogotha some of the Sahaja Yogis
did see the grace falling down, that’s all,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.360
once.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.130
But it will happen more and more.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:14.960
Please try to improve your eye, in the sense
that, ‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes’.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.900
Have no greed in your eye, for anything!

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.700
Try to remove the greed from your eye and
it will definitely start working out.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:32.649
So this is the message for our eyes because
through the eyes you are the light.

00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:39.240
First thing that I have kindled is the light
in your eyes, and that’s what is the light

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:47.130
is to be improved, to be purified with love
– with the Divine Love.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.549
May God bless you all!
