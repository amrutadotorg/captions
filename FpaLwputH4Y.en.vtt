00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:13.530
Today we are here to worship

00:04:16.477 --> 00:04:19.657
the resurrection of Christ.

00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:28.625
And also to thank Him

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.624
for giving us

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:43.124
an ideal life of a saint

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:48.639
who has to work

00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:52.459
for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.942
We talk of Christ,

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.864
we sing of Shri Ganesha,

00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:12.607
we say we believe in Him,

00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:19.348
specially Sahaj Yogis feel He is the eldest brother that they have,

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:27.666
and a tremendous

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:40.534
surrender I find, among Western Sahaj Yogis specially, for Christ.

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.491
Because they were born in Christian religion perhaps, maybe,

00:05:45.692 --> 00:05:50.734
or maybe that they found Christ’s life

00:05:51.624 --> 00:05:54.640
a very special one.

00:05:56.412 --> 00:06:01.778
But to Sahaj Yoga He has to be much more than that,

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.418
and to you Sahaj Yogis.

00:06:06.903 --> 00:06:11.457
Many people believe in many deities.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.445
Like some believe in Shri Krishna, some in Shri Rama,

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:20.481
some in Buddha, some in Mahavira and some in Christ.

00:06:20.896 --> 00:06:24.716
All over the world they do believe

00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:29.333
in some higher being.

00:06:31.253 --> 00:06:37.011
But this belief is without the connection, to begin with,

00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:45.408
and becomes a kind of a

00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:51.641
falsehood that they think that

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.899
Christ belongs to them, Rama belongs to them

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.057
or Shri Krishna belongs to them.

00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:02.218
That they are the possessors of all these deities

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:07.492
because they have obliged of believing into it.

00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:15.362
And that is how most of the faiths have come.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.852
And though they ardently believe in Christ,

00:07:19.237 --> 00:07:23.383
all these faiths have failed.

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:27.091
Because when they believed in Christ, they believed that

00:07:27.292 --> 00:07:33.027
through Christ they can get their cheques cashed.

00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:36.168
It was like a bank.

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:38.984
You pray to God: "You get me all right."  All right.

00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:41.050
Then: "Get my mother all right,

00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:43.736
my father all right, my sister all right."

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:48.576
"Get me so much money! Get me so much wealth!",

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.091
or health or anything.

00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:58.240
Thinking that because we believe in Christ He’s so obliged

00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:03.739
that He has to pay for it and He has to look after us

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:09.275
and that we are

00:08:09.564 --> 00:08:15.397
rightful possessors of His blessings.

00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:20.970
Then they form churches, temples, mosques, clubs,

00:08:21.323 --> 00:08:25.546
believing that, “Now we belong to Christ!

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.228
All this group is a very special chosen one!”,

00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:34.030
or, “We belong to Rama,”

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:38.362
or to Krishna or to someone like that.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.969
And to whomsoever they may ‘belong,’

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:47.299
the one to whom they belong, does not know anything about them!

00:08:48.064 --> 00:08:50.285
Christ has said, “You’ll be calling me, 'Christ, Christ,’

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:52.526
I won’t recognise you!”

00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:58.342
It’s a big warning to people who say, “We believe in Christ.”

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.397
So, without the connection, if you believe in someone,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.026
it has no meaning.

00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:15.339
It’s just like some sort of a mythical, romantic idea

00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:19.279
that the other person whom you believe in

00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:24.319
has a special relationship with you.

00:09:28.287 --> 00:09:31.453
So this assurance that, “I believe into something,”

00:09:31.653 --> 00:09:35.194
or this assumption that, “I believe into something,

00:09:35.468 --> 00:09:39.083
and because I believe into something, I have every right

00:09:39.283 --> 00:09:42.414
to get all the blessings that I ask for,”

00:09:42.656 --> 00:09:46.875
is a myth, as you must have realised after Sahaj Yoga.

00:09:47.937 --> 00:09:50.721
But when you become a Sahaj Yogi,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.171
then you have got your connection with all of them

00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:57.828
and with Christ.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.595
But this connection again, in a subtle way, is the same style.

00:10:06.118 --> 00:10:10.583
For example, what we try to do is to ask again

00:10:10.783 --> 00:10:14.532
that this should be done, that should be done.

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:22.000
“My Agnya is caught up. Mother, please clear it out!”,

00:10:22.782 --> 00:10:25.109
or

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:30.541
“I’ve got headache so please put it right!”

00:10:31.646 --> 00:10:34.491
Because you believe in Sahaj Yoga, you expect Sahaj Yoga

00:10:34.692 --> 00:10:37.169
to feel obliged that, “See now, they believe in me,

00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:40.716
it’s such a great obligation!”

00:10:40.927 --> 00:10:43.572
“So Sahaj Yoga must do something for me!”

00:10:43.845 --> 00:10:47.892
Whether you do anything for Sahaj Yoga is not important.

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:51.314
Only because you believe in Sahaj Yoga,

00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:54.128
because Sahaj Yoga has given you Realisation,

00:10:54.328 --> 00:10:57.708
so Sahaj Yoga has every obligation

00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:00.449
that it should look after you.

00:11:01.366 --> 00:11:03.957
“I am in Sahaj Yoga still, why should I suffer?

00:11:04.157 --> 00:11:08.076
I am in Sahaj Yoga, why should my mother not be all right?”

00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:10.344
“I am in Sahaj Yoga…”

00:11:10.996 --> 00:11:13.574
As if sort of an

00:11:14.902 --> 00:11:17.576
organisation where you have paid money or something

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:21.433
and you are supposed to get all the rewards.

00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:37.897
But now, let us see,

00:11:38.248 --> 00:11:43.428
after Sahaj Yoga, what should be our attitude which is sane?

00:11:45.311 --> 00:11:50.959
The first is that, “Now I’m a Sahaj Yogi

00:11:51.965 --> 00:11:56.361
and now I’m connected to Christ.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.994
So what is my responsibility?”

00:12:07.591 --> 00:12:12.220
Christ felt responsible for the whole world!

00:12:12.852 --> 00:12:14.977
He’s described in the Devi Purana

00:12:15.188 --> 00:12:18.812
as the support of the whole universe.

00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:24.013
As soon as you are connected with Christ,

00:12:24.325 --> 00:12:27.942
the whole attitude has to change.

00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:34.666
So to be connected with Christ means,

00:12:34.895 --> 00:12:40.785
what are the qualities of Christ you have imbibed within yourself?

00:12:41.113 --> 00:12:44.519
That’s the minimum of minimum.

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:50.033
What did you get out of His life?

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:59.781
Is it that He has cured people, all right, so you should get cured?

00:13:01.246 --> 00:13:06.036
He gave eyes to people, so you must get your eyes back?

00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:10.247
Shri Mataji: Do you mind removing this for me?

00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:20.267
Or is it that His life,

00:13:21.037 --> 00:13:24.373
which you have enshrined,

00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:28.133
should also make you something

00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:31.679
that could be enshrined,

00:13:32.273 --> 00:13:35.297
that could be respected,

00:13:36.277 --> 00:13:42.252
that could be called as a reflection of Christ’s life?

00:13:44.463 --> 00:13:48.590
Now let us see His life, what kind of a life He led.

00:13:49.777 --> 00:13:54.123
We read Bible, I mean we carry Bible everywhere

00:13:54.384 --> 00:13:59.101
and even I saw the Bible in the hotel as if

00:13:59.424 --> 00:14:04.041
it’s a part of the thing, like a soap is kept and Bible is!

00:14:07.903 --> 00:14:11.824
Of course, I read it, I don’t know how many read it.

00:14:14.035 --> 00:14:17.957
But then it doesn’t become

00:14:20.956 --> 00:14:24.190
to say you are a Sahaj Yogi,

00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:27.185
if through His connection

00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:30.403
you have not received any one of His qualities.

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:33.297
For example, this is now connected to the mains,

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:35.736
so you are getting electricity through it.

00:14:35.936 --> 00:14:41.282
This doesn’t give electricity to the mains, but it receives.

00:14:44.278 --> 00:14:47.237
So you have to receive something from Him

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:50.096
and what you have to receive

00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:54.963
is the qualities that He had.

00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:03.539
You might say, "Because, Mother, He was Divine,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.371
He was the son of God.”

00:15:11.886 --> 00:15:14.644
But He was also a son of His Mother

00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:18.882
and you are also son of your Mother.

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:25.499
So mediocrity in our character

00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:29.245
cannot say that we are connected with Christ

00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:32.782
because there’s no energy of Christ flowing in you.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.993
When energy of Christ flows through you, you express it.

00:15:38.298 --> 00:15:40.618
Like yesterday the gentleman was playing

00:15:40.818 --> 00:15:45.432
and I think the power of Saraswati started flowing in him

00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:47.241
and how beautiful he played!

00:15:47.462 --> 00:15:49.266
He couldn’t control his fingers.

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:53.555
He said, “It’s all happening here: I don’t know how!”

00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:01.474
So throughout, if you see His life,

00:16:03.615 --> 00:16:07.833
He was a person

00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:14.948
who was all the time bothered about the benevolence of the world.

00:16:17.483 --> 00:16:23.225
How clearly He went and talked to the priests

00:16:24.287 --> 00:16:27.122
and told them

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:32.110
that, “You don’t understand me because you are blind.”

00:16:33.874 --> 00:16:38.442
He told them that He knows His Father

00:16:38.642 --> 00:16:40.681
and His Father knows Him,

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:45.963
“But you do not know me, nor you know your Father.”

00:16:47.143 --> 00:16:52.312
So openly, blatantly, He was talking.

00:16:55.112 --> 00:17:01.047
He was not afraid that He will go to jail.

00:17:02.565 --> 00:17:05.789
He was not afraid that, by saying such a thing,

00:17:05.998 --> 00:17:08.482
the ego of others will be challenged;

00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:13.693
because He was not pretentious.

00:17:14.045 --> 00:17:16.905
He was not doing something that was not truthful.

00:17:17.764 --> 00:17:22.490
He was telling the truth and truth has that capacity

00:17:23.053 --> 00:17:26.390
to express itself through your personality.

00:17:28.577 --> 00:17:32.369
But do we really believe in ourselves?

00:17:34.651 --> 00:17:37.979
Do we really believe that we are Sahaj Yogis,

00:17:40.618 --> 00:17:45.752
that we can talk to people as Christ could talk to them?

00:17:47.352 --> 00:17:49.391
At a very young age of twelve years,

00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:52.726
He could go and talk to the priests.

00:17:52.962 --> 00:17:55.653
What courage!

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.887
There was no need for Him.

00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:04.005
He should have really got married like Sahaj Yogis do

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:08.638
and settled down with His wife and children nicely.

00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:14.768
Because the main headache for Sahaj Yogis seems to be the marriage

00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:19.006
and their children! He never married.

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:24.648
He was so precious

00:18:24.914 --> 00:18:27.859
that He didn’t want to waste His time with these things.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.478
And He died so young, He knew that He had to die.

00:18:35.305 --> 00:18:39.919
So in His life, you see He was not a mundane type of a personality,

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:43.973
not mundane, not ordinary.

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:51.961
And when He spoke with such confidence, with such

00:18:52.328 --> 00:18:56.744
knowledge of truth that people did believe Him, had to believe.

00:18:56.945 --> 00:18:59.219
They couldn’t help it.

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:04.196
This power you too have, and you can do the same.

00:19:05.157 --> 00:19:08.574
But the way He used His power,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.947
why can’t we use?

00:19:12.147 --> 00:19:15.325
Because we are not intense about it.

00:19:17.481 --> 00:19:21.191
Our attention is on something else,

00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:25.141
which is quite frivolous, which is useless.

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:28.558
All right, we are Sahaj Yogis,

00:19:29.327 --> 00:19:32.293
so what do we think about?

00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:37.488
First thing we’ll think, “Now, today’s a puja, what should I wear?”

00:19:39.749 --> 00:19:42.233
Then, "I haven’t yet pressed my clothes," or

00:19:42.436 --> 00:19:47.244
"My sari’s not all right. I have to match it, and how to dress up."

00:19:47.858 --> 00:19:53.709
All these frivolous things first come to our brain.

00:19:53.912 --> 00:19:57.771
Or in the morning, when you get up in your ashrams or anywhere,

00:19:59.747 --> 00:20:02.854
what do you think?

00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:07.710
If it was Christ,

00:20:08.483 --> 00:20:12.644
He would say, “I am sleeping still?

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:16.288
I have to meditate!

00:20:16.522 --> 00:20:21.925
I have to be one with the Divine!”

00:20:22.495 --> 00:20:25.703
He would not say, “No, no, the Divine will look after, it’s all right.

00:20:25.903 --> 00:20:29.158
The Divine will meditate for me!”

00:20:30.697 --> 00:20:33.258
“After all, Paramchaitanya, it has to meditate.

00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:37.560
Why should we meditate? We are all Sahaj Yogis.”

00:20:38.865 --> 00:20:42.328
“Everything is sahaj, so let the Divine meditate for us!”

00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:46.388
“We can’t get up in the morning. It’s difficult.

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:50.430
We can’t, you see, just can’t.”

00:20:52.555 --> 00:20:55.211
But then you can’t be a Sahaj Yogi!

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:58.109
You are supposed to be connected with all the deities,

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.052
not only Christ.

00:21:01.404 --> 00:21:07.327
And here you can’t even get out of your bed - to meditate.

00:21:10.207 --> 00:21:12.349
While all the deities are already up there,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.246
waiting for you to get up, that’s all.

00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:24.139
And they can’t understand what’s happening to these Sahaj Yogis.

00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:28.031
“How can they be so low?

00:21:28.376 --> 00:21:30.534
After all, Mother must have given them Realisation

00:21:30.735 --> 00:21:32.828
thinking them to be something great.

00:21:33.047 --> 00:21:36.279
How did they get Realisation?

00:21:36.823 --> 00:21:40.791
They’re so ordinary, so mundane, so useless!”

00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:44.463
The deities start wondering,

00:21:44.663 --> 00:21:48.123
“Why Mother gave them Realisation?”

00:21:49.428 --> 00:21:53.248
Because a person, who cannot enjoy his meditation,

00:21:53.459 --> 00:21:56.638
cannot be a Sahaj Yogi.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.212
That’s the first sign of a Sahaj Yogi,

00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:08.892
that he looks forward to that time when he can meditate.

00:22:17.095 --> 00:22:21.322
That is the time you are really in connection with the Divine

00:22:21.523 --> 00:22:22.958
and you enjoy the most.

00:22:23.158 --> 00:22:25.521
Whenever I get a chance, I go into it.

00:22:25.722 --> 00:22:28.195
I find it so difficult to come out of it!

00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:30.915
I mean, for today it happened to me,

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:36.686
I was first thinking that I will have to struggle out for this puja.

00:22:39.845 --> 00:22:41.915
I’ll have to work it out.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.541
I don’t know how I will get out of this meditative mood.

00:22:51.562 --> 00:22:54.912
But it surprises so many people,

00:23:04.907 --> 00:23:10.171
how people are meditating.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.618
Especially so many Indians told me this thing.

00:23:14.819 --> 00:23:17.733
It’s something very surprising,

00:23:18.217 --> 00:23:21.331
that they are supposed to be meditating and immediately they get up,

00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:25.257
“What cakes? What things? What have you cooked?” this, that.

00:23:25.538 --> 00:23:30.584
There’s no slumber of

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.869
meditation in them and, just, they just start thinking about food.

00:23:39.361 --> 00:23:41.705
How can that be?

00:23:42.267 --> 00:23:45.657
It’s the way you cannot get out of your sleep,

00:23:45.858 --> 00:23:50.200
in the same way a Sahaj Yogi cannot get out of his meditative mood.

00:23:50.423 --> 00:23:53.678
It’s so enjoyable.

00:23:53.939 --> 00:23:57.107
You want to be there.

00:23:57.314 --> 00:24:01.066
So one of the signs that you are not yet anywhere near Sahaj Yoga

00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:06.370
is that if you cannot enjoy your meditation.

00:24:11.723 --> 00:24:14.442
I mean, imagine

00:24:14.825 --> 00:24:17.826
if you enjoy a television show or anything,

00:24:18.073 --> 00:24:21.370
you have to see it, isn’t it?

00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:26.223
You cannot just say, “All right, I’m sleeping now

00:24:26.423 --> 00:24:29.759
and I am enjoying the television.”

00:24:30.324 --> 00:24:35.457
So you have to be awakened to it but that awakening is within,

00:24:35.685 --> 00:24:41.427
and there you see your own connection.

00:24:42.465 --> 00:24:45.549
It’s a joy that I cannot describe really.

00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:47.865
There’s only one word for that, is nirananda,

00:24:48.066 --> 00:24:52.467
means it’s just, 'Nira' means ‘only the joy, absolute joy’.

00:24:52.668 --> 00:24:55.758
And who would like to give up the joy for what?

00:24:56.489 --> 00:24:59.501
For a cake or for a tea or this thing?

00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:02.872
I mean, just think of it!

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:11.189
The joy is so deep, so intense, so beautiful.

00:25:12.368 --> 00:25:15.548
I don’t know what else to say.

00:25:18.197 --> 00:25:19.978
You have not tasted the ambrosia,

00:25:20.178 --> 00:25:21.985
otherwise you would have said, as if the

00:25:22.185 --> 00:25:26.150
ambrosia is trickling down on your tongue.

00:25:26.388 --> 00:25:29.433
It’s like that, the taste of it.

00:25:32.917 --> 00:25:38.139
But what I find that the depth we have not touched.

00:25:38.354 --> 00:25:40.623
Which is within us. All of you have that depth.

00:25:40.823 --> 00:25:44.510
It’s not that you don’t have. I have not given you Realisation

00:25:44.736 --> 00:25:49.304
because you are just there, here

00:25:49.523 --> 00:25:52.312
because you have that depth within you.

00:25:52.538 --> 00:25:54.913
You are special people with that depth.

00:25:55.132 --> 00:25:59.763
But you haven’t touched it. It shows you haven’t touched it.

00:26:00.897 --> 00:26:04.189
Supposing it’s like a well full of water,

00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:07.162
but you are still dangling somewhere in the middle,

00:26:07.363 --> 00:26:08.918
you haven’t yet touched that depth.

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:13.684
Because once you get into that, you get completely drenched

00:26:13.964 --> 00:26:15.795
and lost.

00:26:15.996 --> 00:26:17.986
But if that is not the situation,

00:26:18.186 --> 00:26:21.877
that shows that you are still somewhere dangling in between

00:26:22.077 --> 00:26:25.813
and any time you can come high and dry.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.594
So you have to judge yourself.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.904
This is the time for you to judge you are in connection with Christ.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.036
He achieved His resurrection,

00:26:38.237 --> 00:26:41.322
by which we have to achieve our resurrection.

00:26:41.526 --> 00:26:43.828
But what have we done

00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:48.090
to achieve that resurrection which He has achieved?

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:52.030
He intensely

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.279
lived a life of complete sacrifice

00:26:57.678 --> 00:27:01.310
and complete concentration

00:27:03.107 --> 00:27:04.992
towards one goal:

00:27:05.192 --> 00:27:09.034
that He has to achieve the resurrection.

00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:15.995
Nothing else was important to Him.

00:27:18.787 --> 00:27:22.514
All that attention was on one thing

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:29.628
that, “I have to achieve this resurrection.

00:27:29.829 --> 00:27:34.417
I have to get crucified and I have to be resurrected,

00:27:34.617 --> 00:27:38.984
because the whole world has to be resurrected.”

00:27:42.449 --> 00:27:45.245
But Sahaj Yogis,

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:49.238
I don’t know how many think that way,

00:27:49.628 --> 00:27:53.720
how many think that dedication is needed.

00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:58.353
And the best part of it

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.774
that it’s so joy-giving.

00:28:01.986 --> 00:28:05.424
Every step you move forward,

00:28:05.713 --> 00:28:08.494
it’s so joy-giving.

00:28:08.838 --> 00:28:13.166
This sinking in that well

00:28:13.521 --> 00:28:15.835
is so very joy-giving.

00:28:16.035 --> 00:28:19.702
It’s not painful, you don’t have to crucify yourself,

00:28:19.912 --> 00:28:24.436
you don’t have to carry the cross. He’s done it for you.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.796
So what do you sacrifice?

00:28:29.065 --> 00:28:32.518
Is your laziness!

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.913
When it comes to the satisfaction of ego,

00:28:39.113 --> 00:28:42.147
people are overactive.

00:28:43.234 --> 00:28:45.511
They are like bullets then.

00:28:45.778 --> 00:28:49.739
And when it is the satisfaction of their physical comfort,

00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:52.916
they become – I don’t know.

00:28:53.997 --> 00:28:56.591
We had one rakshasa called Kumbhakarna,

00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:00.001
who used to sleep for six months

00:29:00.201 --> 00:29:05.208
and used to be awake six months.

00:29:05.408 --> 00:29:09.363
But here I see people sleep for twelve months,

00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:12.570
so what do you call them?

00:29:16.668 --> 00:29:20.381
Then they say, “Mother, we can’t keep awake!” Why?

00:29:20.644 --> 00:29:24.652
Because you are not meditating,

00:29:25.107 --> 00:29:28.102
you are not one with Christ.

00:29:29.285 --> 00:29:32.622
Then His agnya, He controls.

00:29:33.819 --> 00:29:36.873
With that Agnya, you cannot sleep.

00:29:37.739 --> 00:29:42.473
If His blessings are there on the Agnya, you cannot sleep.

00:29:42.746 --> 00:29:45.600
You won’t believe with the slightest light,

00:29:45.832 --> 00:29:48.617
artificial light specially, I can’t sleep;

00:29:48.867 --> 00:29:51.757
because still Christ is awake

00:29:52.148 --> 00:29:55.157
and I have to be awake.

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:02.887
So you have to be awakened to this fact that we are Sahaj Yogis.

00:30:03.087 --> 00:30:05.332
We have a special responsibility

00:30:05.532 --> 00:30:08.183
as our connection with Christ is.

00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:13.851
Our main responsibility is, all the time, intensely, to think,

00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:18.500
“What we can do for the betterment of human beings?

00:30:21.235 --> 00:30:24.328
And what are we doing about it?”

00:30:26.812 --> 00:30:29.749
First I used to say, “Count your blessings,”

00:30:29.965 --> 00:30:33.376
because that was the best way to make people understand

00:30:33.576 --> 00:30:37.476
that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga.

00:30:41.397 --> 00:30:43.844
Now I would say, “Count your deeds.”

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.311
What have you done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:30:47.592 --> 00:30:50.043
Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.

00:30:50.701 --> 00:30:53.055
To say that Paramchaitanya will look after you

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.327
is absolutely absurd!

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.407
If Paramchaitanya could do everything

00:31:02.641 --> 00:31:05.810
why should it create human beings?

00:31:08.697 --> 00:31:11.737
One Adam and Eve were sufficient.

00:31:14.368 --> 00:31:16.743
You have to do it.

00:31:16.984 --> 00:31:21.663
Unless and until you become deep,

00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:25.929
it cannot trigger, it is helpless.

00:31:26.603 --> 00:31:30.751
It’s only through you it is going to work out.

00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:40.462
Now if there is no instrument, electricity cannot work, can it?

00:31:41.063 --> 00:31:44.378
Now you should say, “The electricity itself must come before me

00:31:44.579 --> 00:31:48.117
and must do everything!”

00:31:50.698 --> 00:31:55.753
You have to have the instrument and you are the instrument

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:02.093
and if you do not want to do it, how can Paramchaitanya do it?

00:32:02.673 --> 00:32:04.756
It will be something like saying, as I told you,

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:09.634
that, “Let electricity do the job, we’ll not have any instrument.”

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.824
Can I work it out?

00:32:14.373 --> 00:32:17.324
Can you work it out?

00:32:22.426 --> 00:32:27.535
So Paramchaitanya has its own style.

00:32:28.523 --> 00:32:32.414
It can only work if you people want to work it out.

00:32:32.726 --> 00:32:37.367
It’s an energy and you are the instrument.

00:32:39.748 --> 00:32:44.505
But the instrument is more busy with the job,

00:32:45.195 --> 00:32:47.570
with the family,

00:32:48.606 --> 00:32:52.137
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:32:52.801 --> 00:32:58.786
Now supposing this instrument, which is meant for my lecture,

00:33:01.004 --> 00:33:04.097
forgets what it is

00:33:04.773 --> 00:33:08.059
and acts like a ladle in the kitchen

00:33:08.651 --> 00:33:12.678
because it’s fond of food, say, for example:

00:33:14.694 --> 00:33:18.843
then what’s the use of making this useless instrument?

00:33:19.077 --> 00:33:22.178
It doesn’t do what it has to do.

00:33:23.483 --> 00:33:28.256
It doesn’t know what it has been made for.

00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:37.224
It has no purpose at all. It’s such a useless stuff.

00:33:42.624 --> 00:33:47.236
So I feel there’s a kind of a lethargy,

00:33:47.437 --> 00:33:51.581
a kind of a very subtle lethargy working out,

00:33:55.175 --> 00:33:56.769
like this that,

00:33:56.969 --> 00:34:01.635
“We’ve done our job. Let the young people do it now!”

00:34:05.227 --> 00:34:07.743
You are matured,

00:34:08.017 --> 00:34:11.121
and the matured have to do the job.

00:34:16.282 --> 00:34:20.579
“We have done our level best!”.  What have you done so far?

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.475
So much to be done still.

00:34:34.217 --> 00:34:37.146
And somehow or other

00:34:38.662 --> 00:34:40.085
we have to touch

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.875
that area where such people remain like the yesterday’s player.

00:34:45.153 --> 00:34:48.457
He is not doing God’s work.

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:53.803
He’s an artist

00:34:55.621 --> 00:35:00.480
and he’s working so hard to achieve perfection.

00:35:04.692 --> 00:35:08.583
He will get the same amount whether he’s perfect or not,

00:35:13.664 --> 00:35:15.725
but he’s practising at home,

00:35:15.968 --> 00:35:19.827
he’s listening to it, he’s trying to develop it.

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.505
All the time working it out so that

00:35:23.798 --> 00:35:27.587
his performance should be excellent.

00:35:28.405 --> 00:35:30.880
So he’s seeking an excellence.

00:35:31.122 --> 00:35:35.177
Mediocrity has no place in Sahaj Yoga.

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:43.602
Only through excellence you’ll enjoy.

00:35:43.805 --> 00:35:49.786
Only through excellence you will really become Sahaj Yogis.

00:35:51.606 --> 00:35:56.809
Otherwise, you could be a headache

00:35:57.504 --> 00:36:00.653
to me and to yourself.

00:36:04.003 --> 00:36:07.956
You would be a headache to Sahaj Yogis.

00:36:08.884 --> 00:36:12.111
A most non-progressive, destructive element

00:36:12.311 --> 00:36:17.572
I would say a person is who is not alert.

00:36:18.311 --> 00:36:21.327
You have to be aware,

00:36:22.031 --> 00:36:25.351
aware of your responsibilities.

00:36:25.648 --> 00:36:27.757
So far

00:36:28.347 --> 00:36:32.954
I have been saying that still the preparation is on,

00:36:33.169 --> 00:36:36.833
they have to correct themselves,

00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:40.348
they have to clear out themselves,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:49.676
they have to work it out, still their conditionings, this ego.

00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:55.376
But now, twenty years have passed

00:36:56.605 --> 00:36:59.340
and beware!

00:36:59.877 --> 00:37:04.166
Be aware that twenty-first year

00:37:04.487 --> 00:37:08.354
is going to be a very big jump.

00:37:08.815 --> 00:37:12.590
I’m warning you again and again and again and again.

00:37:13.278 --> 00:37:19.278
And you have to work very hard to develop yourself vertically

00:37:20.563 --> 00:37:25.066
in balance with your horizontal growth.

00:37:25.758 --> 00:37:29.137
It’s not my lecture for entertainment or anything,

00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:34.628
but should go to your heart, to your brain, to your being,

00:37:34.953 --> 00:37:38.355
as this is very important.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.268
And you are not going to waste it.

00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:47.104
All the time you have to think that you are a Sahaj Yogi

00:37:47.416 --> 00:37:52.206
and you have to know what you have to do in Sahaj Yoga

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.635
and how to achieve it.

00:37:56.948 --> 00:37:58.967
You should not be satisfied

00:37:59.167 --> 00:38:02.839
unless and until you have achieved that excellence.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.290
That’s the very important, crucial point today

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:12.156
I wanted to tell you because today is

00:38:12.562 --> 00:38:16.066
Easter Day which was a very crucial point

00:38:16.301 --> 00:38:20.429
for the development or the growth of the Spirit,

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.812
because Sahasrara we could never have achieved

00:38:24.013 --> 00:38:27.078
if Agnya was blocked.

00:38:30.766 --> 00:38:32.208
Christ could have said,

00:38:32.408 --> 00:38:34.911
“All right, let Paramchaitanya do it!

00:38:35.111 --> 00:38:39.017
Let Paramchaitanya get itself hanged.

00:38:39.874 --> 00:38:42.749
Why should I do it?”

00:38:45.632 --> 00:38:51.084
He had to do it and He was the instrument and He’s done it.

00:38:53.185 --> 00:38:58.498
So Sahaj Yoga is not only for exploiters.

00:38:59.529 --> 00:39:05.316
If you try just to exploit Sahaj Yoga, you’ll be exploited too.

00:39:06.714 --> 00:39:09.843
But is for the exploitation of joy.

00:39:10.144 --> 00:39:14.675
But that’s only possible if you grow, you touch your depth.

00:39:14.927 --> 00:39:19.560
If you are not deep enough, you’ll hang in the air, as I said.

00:39:19.974 --> 00:39:24.073
And that has to be worked out, that has to be found out:

00:39:26.287 --> 00:39:30.297
how best you can do it, how much you can reach people,

00:39:30.498 --> 00:39:32.300
how many people you have given Realisation,

00:39:32.524 --> 00:39:36.288
how many people you’re going to help improve their health,

00:39:36.529 --> 00:39:40.188
their mental conditions and then

00:39:40.389 --> 00:39:44.282
how much you are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:47.743 --> 00:39:53.495
So that is going to work out what I call

00:39:53.979 --> 00:39:59.323
the collective ascent

00:40:02.245 --> 00:40:04.826
of human beings.

00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:08.724
May God bless you!

00:40:23.598 --> 00:40:28.152
To be in connection with Christ is to be

00:40:28.402 --> 00:40:32.371
enjoying your meditation.

00:40:41.258 --> 00:40:43.312
All right.

00:40:43.554 --> 00:40:49.312
So, puja is another thing which, I know it, helps you a lot.

00:40:50.773 --> 00:40:54.616
It gives you a definite push, I should say,

00:40:54.866 --> 00:40:57.709
but you don’t retain it.

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:04.139
You don’t retain it. Then what’s the use?

00:41:05.369 --> 00:41:08.897
So also you have to retain,

00:41:12.988 --> 00:41:16.353
should have power to retain.

00:41:16.978 --> 00:41:20.132
That’s only possible if you have

00:41:21.259 --> 00:41:25.413
touched your depths, which you have.

00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:33.217
I am so happy to come back to you all.

00:41:34.037 --> 00:41:36.811
I missed you all very much.

00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:42.762
I’m travelling and working very hard.

00:41:45.262 --> 00:41:50.456
I don’t know if I work hard. I don’t think about it, never.

00:41:52.792 --> 00:41:57.440
So once you know that this is what you have to be,

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:01.194
then you don’t work, it just works.

00:42:03.668 --> 00:42:08.858
Then you don’t think you are working.

00:42:10.242 --> 00:42:14.141
This is a subtle point you have to understand:

00:42:15.234 --> 00:42:18.843
that everything works out

00:42:21.052 --> 00:42:24.226
and you work in a way

00:42:27.157 --> 00:42:31.161
and it works out, but you don’t work.

00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:36.641
Like the Sun shines:

00:42:37.063 --> 00:42:40.453
if you ask the Sun, “Poor Sun, you have to work so hard!”

00:42:40.704 --> 00:42:45.326
He said, “When? When was that?”

00:42:46.326 --> 00:42:49.178
So you say, “You have to rise in the morning, then you have to…”.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.894
“No, no, no, no, no! I was just with myself, nothing else.

00:42:55.105 --> 00:43:00.066
I was with myself, I was enjoying myself. When did I work?”

00:43:02.818 --> 00:43:06.014
As long as you are with yourself

00:43:06.215 --> 00:43:08.695
there is no question of you getting bored

00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:11.939
or no question of you getting tired, nothing.

00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:15.281
You are with yourself, finished!

00:43:16.753 --> 00:43:20.617
But unless and until that happens within you

00:43:20.882 --> 00:43:22.509
then these problems do come up,

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:27.111
and so please, please again I would say,

00:43:27.544 --> 00:43:30.559
value your Self-realisation,

00:43:31.466 --> 00:43:35.942
value your Realisation, value your life.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.716
You all are very precious people

00:43:38.917 --> 00:43:42.542
and you are the ones who are chosen.

00:43:46.096 --> 00:43:49.544
I hope all of you come to Sahasrara day

00:43:49.745 --> 00:43:55.645
after a very intensive meditative time.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:05.529
Otherwise suddenly I’ll find people who are doing Sahasrara puja

00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:09.169
with their all Sahasraras caught up.

00:44:12.594 --> 00:44:15.602
May God bless you!

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.441
May God bless you.
