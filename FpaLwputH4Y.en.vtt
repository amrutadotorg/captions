WEBVTT

04:09.616 --> 04:13.530
Today we are here to worship

04:16.477 --> 04:19.657
the resurrection of Christ.

04:23.524 --> 04:28.625
And also to thank Him

04:29.789 --> 04:33.624
for giving us

04:38.147 --> 04:43.124
an ideal life of a saint

04:44.936 --> 04:48.639
who has to work

04:49.123 --> 04:52.459
for the benevolence of the whole world.

04:57.695 --> 05:00.942
We talk of Christ,

05:01.833 --> 05:04.864
we sing of Shri Ganesha,

05:09.524 --> 05:12.607
we say we believe in Him,

05:13.383 --> 05:19.348
specially Sahaj Yogis feel He is the eldest brother that they have,

05:23.923 --> 05:27.666
and a tremendous

05:35.144 --> 05:40.534
surrender I find, among Western Sahaj Yogis specially, for Christ.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.491
Because they were born in Christian religion perhaps, maybe,

05:45.692 --> 05:50.734
or maybe that they found Christ’s life

05:51.624 --> 05:54.640
a very special one.

05:56.412 --> 06:01.778
But to Sahaj Yoga He has to be much more than that,

06:03.231 --> 06:06.418
and to you Sahaj Yogis.

06:06.903 --> 06:11.457
Many people believe in many deities.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.445
Like some believe in Shri Krishna, some in Shri Rama,

06:15.646 --> 06:20.481
some in Buddha, some in Mahavira and some in Christ.

06:20.896 --> 06:24.716
All over the world they do believe

06:25.044 --> 06:29.333
in some higher being.

06:31.253 --> 06:37.011
But this belief is without the connection, to begin with,

06:39.885 --> 06:45.408
and becomes a kind of a

06:45.681 --> 06:51.641
falsehood that they think that

06:52.360 --> 06:54.899
Christ belongs to them, Rama belongs to them

06:55.110 --> 06:58.057
or Shri Krishna belongs to them.

06:58.281 --> 07:02.218
That they are the possessors of all these deities

07:02.419 --> 07:07.492
because they have obliged of believing into it.

07:11.511 --> 07:15.362
And that is how most of the faiths have come.

07:15.620 --> 07:18.852
And though they ardently believe in Christ,

07:19.237 --> 07:23.383
all these faiths have failed.

07:24.175 --> 07:27.091
Because when they believed in Christ, they believed that

07:27.292 --> 07:33.027
through Christ they can get their cheques cashed.

07:33.793 --> 07:36.168
It was like a bank.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.984
You pray to God: "You get me all right."  All right.

07:39.184 --> 07:41.050
Then: "Get my mother all right,

07:41.251 --> 07:43.736
my father all right, my sister all right."

07:43.936 --> 07:48.576
"Get me so much money! Get me so much wealth!",

07:48.830 --> 07:52.091
or health or anything.

07:53.357 --> 07:58.240
Thinking that because we believe in Christ He’s so obliged

07:58.646 --> 08:03.739
that He has to pay for it and He has to look after us

08:05.033 --> 08:09.275
and that we are

08:09.564 --> 08:15.397
rightful possessors of His blessings.

08:15.942 --> 08:20.970
Then they form churches, temples, mosques, clubs,

08:21.323 --> 08:25.546
believing that, “Now we belong to Christ!

08:25.850 --> 08:29.228
All this group is a very special chosen one!”,

08:29.483 --> 08:34.030
or, “We belong to Rama,”

08:34.264 --> 08:38.362
or to Krishna or to someone like that.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.969
And to whomsoever they may ‘belong,’

08:42.237 --> 08:47.299
the one to whom they belong, does not know anything about them!

08:48.064 --> 08:50.285
Christ has said, “You’ll be calling me, 'Christ, Christ,’

08:50.486 --> 08:52.526
I won’t recognise you!”

08:52.751 --> 08:58.342
It’s a big warning to people who say, “We believe in Christ.”

09:01.350 --> 09:05.397
So, without the connection, if you believe in someone,

09:07.030 --> 09:09.026
it has no meaning.

09:09.631 --> 09:15.339
It’s just like some sort of a mythical, romantic idea

09:15.636 --> 09:19.279
that the other person whom you believe in

09:19.561 --> 09:24.319
has a special relationship with you.

09:28.287 --> 09:31.453
So this assurance that, “I believe into something,”

09:31.653 --> 09:35.194
or this assumption that, “I believe into something,

09:35.468 --> 09:39.083
and because I believe into something, I have every right

09:39.283 --> 09:42.414
to get all the blessings that I ask for,”

09:42.656 --> 09:46.875
is a myth, as you must have realised after Sahaj Yoga.

09:47.937 --> 09:50.721
But when you become a Sahaj Yogi,

09:51.150 --> 09:55.171
then you have got your connection with all of them

09:55.371 --> 09:57.828
and with Christ.

10:01.220 --> 10:05.595
But this connection again, in a subtle way, is the same style.

10:06.118 --> 10:10.583
For example, what we try to do is to ask again

10:10.783 --> 10:14.532
that this should be done, that should be done.

10:17.594 --> 10:22.000
“My Agnya is caught up. Mother, please clear it out!”,

10:22.782 --> 10:25.109
or

10:26.009 --> 10:30.541
“I’ve got headache so please put it right!”

10:31.646 --> 10:34.491
Because you believe in Sahaj Yoga, you expect Sahaj Yoga

10:34.692 --> 10:37.169
to feel obliged that, “See now, they believe in me,

10:37.411 --> 10:40.716
it’s such a great obligation!”

10:40.927 --> 10:43.572
“So Sahaj Yoga must do something for me!”

10:43.845 --> 10:47.892
Whether you do anything for Sahaj Yoga is not important.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.314
Only because you believe in Sahaj Yoga,

10:51.699 --> 10:54.128
because Sahaj Yoga has given you Realisation,

10:54.328 --> 10:57.708
so Sahaj Yoga has every obligation

10:57.908 --> 11:00.449
that it should look after you.

11:01.366 --> 11:03.957
“I am in Sahaj Yoga still, why should I suffer?

11:04.157 --> 11:08.076
I am in Sahaj Yoga, why should my mother not be all right?”

11:08.391 --> 11:10.344
“I am in Sahaj Yoga…”

11:10.996 --> 11:13.574
As if sort of an

11:14.902 --> 11:17.576
organisation where you have paid money or something

11:17.777 --> 11:21.433
and you are supposed to get all the rewards.

11:35.952 --> 11:37.897
But now, let us see,

11:38.248 --> 11:43.428
after Sahaj Yoga, what should be our attitude which is sane?

11:45.311 --> 11:50.959
The first is that, “Now I’m a Sahaj Yogi

11:51.965 --> 11:56.361
and now I’m connected to Christ.

11:58.900 --> 12:03.994
So what is my responsibility?”

12:07.591 --> 12:12.220
Christ felt responsible for the whole world!

12:12.852 --> 12:14.977
He’s described in the Devi Purana

12:15.188 --> 12:18.812
as the support of the whole universe.

12:20.633 --> 12:24.013
As soon as you are connected with Christ,

12:24.325 --> 12:27.942
the whole attitude has to change.

12:30.739 --> 12:34.666
So to be connected with Christ means,

12:34.895 --> 12:40.785
what are the qualities of Christ you have imbibed within yourself?

12:41.113 --> 12:44.519
That’s the minimum of minimum.

12:45.649 --> 12:50.033
What did you get out of His life?

12:53.820 --> 12:59.781
Is it that He has cured people, all right, so you should get cured?

13:01.246 --> 13:06.036
He gave eyes to people, so you must get your eyes back?

13:07.208 --> 13:10.247
Shri Mataji: Do you mind removing this for me?

13:15.334 --> 13:20.267
Or is it that His life,

13:21.037 --> 13:24.373
which you have enshrined,

13:24.765 --> 13:28.133
should also make you something

13:28.351 --> 13:31.679
that could be enshrined,

13:32.273 --> 13:35.297
that could be respected,

13:36.277 --> 13:42.252
that could be called as a reflection of Christ’s life?

13:44.463 --> 13:48.590
Now let us see His life, what kind of a life He led.

13:49.777 --> 13:54.123
We read Bible, I mean we carry Bible everywhere

13:54.384 --> 13:59.101
and even I saw the Bible in the hotel as if

13:59.424 --> 14:04.041
it’s a part of the thing, like a soap is kept and Bible is!

14:07.903 --> 14:11.824
Of course, I read it, I don’t know how many read it.

14:14.035 --> 14:17.957
But then it doesn’t become

14:20.956 --> 14:24.190
to say you are a Sahaj Yogi,

14:24.461 --> 14:27.185
if through His connection

14:27.385 --> 14:30.403
you have not received any one of His qualities.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.297
For example, this is now connected to the mains,

14:33.497 --> 14:35.736
so you are getting electricity through it.

14:35.936 --> 14:41.282
This doesn’t give electricity to the mains, but it receives.

14:44.278 --> 14:47.237
So you have to receive something from Him

14:47.825 --> 14:50.096
and what you have to receive

14:50.308 --> 14:54.963
is the qualities that He had.

14:59.445 --> 15:03.539
You might say, "Because, Mother, He was Divine,

15:06.230 --> 15:09.371
He was the son of God.”

15:11.886 --> 15:14.644
But He was also a son of His Mother

15:14.918 --> 15:18.882
and you are also son of your Mother.

15:21.639 --> 15:25.499
So mediocrity in our character

15:27.409 --> 15:29.245
cannot say that we are connected with Christ

15:29.446 --> 15:32.782
because there’s no energy of Christ flowing in you.

15:33.010 --> 15:37.993
When energy of Christ flows through you, you express it.

15:38.298 --> 15:40.618
Like yesterday the gentleman was playing

15:40.818 --> 15:45.432
and I think the power of Saraswati started flowing in him

15:45.681 --> 15:47.241
and how beautiful he played!

15:47.462 --> 15:49.266
He couldn’t control his fingers.

15:49.466 --> 15:53.555
He said, “It’s all happening here: I don’t know how!”

15:57.951 --> 16:01.474
So throughout, if you see His life,

16:03.615 --> 16:07.833
He was a person

16:09.311 --> 16:14.948
who was all the time bothered about the benevolence of the world.

16:17.483 --> 16:23.225
How clearly He went and talked to the priests

16:24.287 --> 16:27.122
and told them

16:27.454 --> 16:32.110
that, “You don’t understand me because you are blind.”

16:33.874 --> 16:38.442
He told them that He knows His Father

16:38.642 --> 16:40.681
and His Father knows Him,

16:41.033 --> 16:45.963
“But you do not know me, nor you know your Father.”

16:47.143 --> 16:52.312
So openly, blatantly, He was talking.

16:55.112 --> 17:01.047
He was not afraid that He will go to jail.

17:02.565 --> 17:05.789
He was not afraid that, by saying such a thing,

17:05.998 --> 17:08.482
the ego of others will be challenged;

17:08.723 --> 17:13.693
because He was not pretentious.

17:14.045 --> 17:16.905
He was not doing something that was not truthful.

17:17.764 --> 17:22.490
He was telling the truth and truth has that capacity

17:23.053 --> 17:26.390
to express itself through your personality.

17:28.577 --> 17:32.369
But do we really believe in ourselves?

17:34.651 --> 17:37.979
Do we really believe that we are Sahaj Yogis,

17:40.618 --> 17:45.752
that we can talk to people as Christ could talk to them?

17:47.352 --> 17:49.391
At a very young age of twelve years,

17:49.591 --> 17:52.726
He could go and talk to the priests.

17:52.962 --> 17:55.653
What courage!

17:55.880 --> 17:58.887
There was no need for Him.

17:59.224 --> 18:04.005
He should have really got married like Sahaj Yogis do

18:04.216 --> 18:08.638
and settled down with His wife and children nicely.

18:09.535 --> 18:14.768
Because the main headache for Sahaj Yogis seems to be the marriage

18:15.157 --> 18:19.006
and their children! He never married.

18:22.179 --> 18:24.648
He was so precious

18:24.914 --> 18:27.859
that He didn’t want to waste His time with these things.

18:28.180 --> 18:32.478
And He died so young, He knew that He had to die.

18:35.305 --> 18:39.919
So in His life, you see He was not a mundane type of a personality,

18:40.119 --> 18:43.973
not mundane, not ordinary.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.961
And when He spoke with such confidence, with such

18:52.328 --> 18:56.744
knowledge of truth that people did believe Him, had to believe.

18:56.945 --> 18:59.219
They couldn’t help it.

18:59.513 --> 19:04.196
This power you too have, and you can do the same.

19:05.157 --> 19:08.574
But the way He used His power,

19:10.680 --> 19:11.947
why can’t we use?

19:12.147 --> 19:15.325
Because we are not intense about it.

19:17.481 --> 19:21.191
Our attention is on something else,

19:21.579 --> 19:25.141
which is quite frivolous, which is useless.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.558
All right, we are Sahaj Yogis,

19:29.327 --> 19:32.293
so what do we think about?

19:32.819 --> 19:37.488
First thing we’ll think, “Now, today’s a puja, what should I wear?”

19:39.749 --> 19:42.233
Then, "I haven’t yet pressed my clothes," or

19:42.436 --> 19:47.244
"My sari’s not all right. I have to match it, and how to dress up."

19:47.858 --> 19:53.709
All these frivolous things first come to our brain.

19:53.912 --> 19:57.771
Or in the morning, when you get up in your ashrams or anywhere,

19:59.747 --> 20:02.854
what do you think?

20:04.695 --> 20:07.710
If it was Christ,

20:08.483 --> 20:12.644
He would say, “I am sleeping still?

20:13.378 --> 20:16.288
I have to meditate!

20:16.522 --> 20:21.925
I have to be one with the Divine!”

20:22.495 --> 20:25.703
He would not say, “No, no, the Divine will look after, it’s all right.

20:25.903 --> 20:29.158
The Divine will meditate for me!”

20:30.697 --> 20:33.258
“After all, Paramchaitanya, it has to meditate.

20:33.458 --> 20:37.560
Why should we meditate? We are all Sahaj Yogis.”

20:38.865 --> 20:42.328
“Everything is sahaj, so let the Divine meditate for us!”

20:42.529 --> 20:46.388
“We can’t get up in the morning. It’s difficult.

20:46.619 --> 20:50.430
We can’t, you see, just can’t.”

20:52.555 --> 20:55.211
But then you can’t be a Sahaj Yogi!

20:55.519 --> 20:58.109
You are supposed to be connected with all the deities,

20:58.310 --> 21:01.052
not only Christ.

21:01.404 --> 21:07.327
And here you can’t even get out of your bed - to meditate.

21:10.207 --> 21:12.349
While all the deities are already up there,

21:12.550 --> 21:16.246
waiting for you to get up, that’s all.

21:18.719 --> 21:24.139
And they can’t understand what’s happening to these Sahaj Yogis.

21:25.336 --> 21:28.031
“How can they be so low?

21:28.376 --> 21:30.534
After all, Mother must have given them Realisation

21:30.735 --> 21:32.828
thinking them to be something great.

21:33.047 --> 21:36.279
How did they get Realisation?

21:36.823 --> 21:40.791
They’re so ordinary, so mundane, so useless!”

21:41.651 --> 21:44.463
The deities start wondering,

21:44.663 --> 21:48.123
“Why Mother gave them Realisation?”

21:49.428 --> 21:53.248
Because a person, who cannot enjoy his meditation,

21:53.459 --> 21:56.638
cannot be a Sahaj Yogi.

21:59.670 --> 22:03.212
That’s the first sign of a Sahaj Yogi,

22:03.431 --> 22:08.892
that he looks forward to that time when he can meditate.

22:17.095 --> 22:21.322
That is the time you are really in connection with the Divine

22:21.523 --> 22:22.958
and you enjoy the most.

22:23.158 --> 22:25.521
Whenever I get a chance, I go into it.

22:25.722 --> 22:28.195
I find it so difficult to come out of it!

22:28.421 --> 22:30.915
I mean, for today it happened to me,

22:31.116 --> 22:36.686
I was first thinking that I will have to struggle out for this puja.

22:39.845 --> 22:41.915
I’ll have to work it out.

22:44.510 --> 22:48.541
I don’t know how I will get out of this meditative mood.

22:51.562 --> 22:54.912
But it surprises so many people,

23:04.907 --> 23:10.171
how people are meditating.

23:12.710 --> 23:14.618
Especially so many Indians told me this thing.

23:14.819 --> 23:17.733
It’s something very surprising,

23:18.217 --> 23:21.331
that they are supposed to be meditating and immediately they get up,

23:21.531 --> 23:25.257
“What cakes? What things? What have you cooked?” this, that.

23:25.538 --> 23:30.584
There’s no slumber of

23:30.960 --> 23:36.869
meditation in them and, just, they just start thinking about food.

23:39.361 --> 23:41.705
How can that be?

23:42.267 --> 23:45.657
It’s the way you cannot get out of your sleep,

23:45.858 --> 23:50.200
in the same way a Sahaj Yogi cannot get out of his meditative mood.

23:50.423 --> 23:53.678
It’s so enjoyable.

23:53.939 --> 23:57.107
You want to be there.

23:57.314 --> 24:01.066
So one of the signs that you are not yet anywhere near Sahaj Yoga

24:01.267 --> 24:06.370
is that if you cannot enjoy your meditation.

24:11.723 --> 24:14.442
I mean, imagine

24:14.825 --> 24:17.826
if you enjoy a television show or anything,

24:18.073 --> 24:21.370
you have to see it, isn’t it?

24:24.125 --> 24:26.223
You cannot just say, “All right, I’m sleeping now

24:26.423 --> 24:29.759
and I am enjoying the television.”

24:30.324 --> 24:35.457
So you have to be awakened to it but that awakening is within,

24:35.685 --> 24:41.427
and there you see your own connection.

24:42.465 --> 24:45.549
It’s a joy that I cannot describe really.

24:45.801 --> 24:47.865
There’s only one word for that, is nirananda,

24:48.066 --> 24:52.467
means it’s just, 'Nira' means ‘only the joy, absolute joy’.

24:52.668 --> 24:55.758
And who would like to give up the joy for what?

24:56.489 --> 24:59.501
For a cake or for a tea or this thing?

24:59.701 --> 25:02.872
I mean, just think of it!

25:05.403 --> 25:11.189
The joy is so deep, so intense, so beautiful.

25:12.368 --> 25:15.548
I don’t know what else to say.

25:18.197 --> 25:19.978
You have not tasted the ambrosia,

25:20.178 --> 25:21.985
otherwise you would have said, as if the

25:22.185 --> 25:26.150
ambrosia is trickling down on your tongue.

25:26.388 --> 25:29.433
It’s like that, the taste of it.

25:32.917 --> 25:38.139
But what I find that the depth we have not touched.

25:38.354 --> 25:40.623
Which is within us. All of you have that depth.

25:40.823 --> 25:44.510
It’s not that you don’t have. I have not given you Realisation

25:44.736 --> 25:49.304
because you are just there, here

25:49.523 --> 25:52.312
because you have that depth within you.

25:52.538 --> 25:54.913
You are special people with that depth.

25:55.132 --> 25:59.763
But you haven’t touched it. It shows you haven’t touched it.

26:00.897 --> 26:04.189
Supposing it’s like a well full of water,

26:04.389 --> 26:07.162
but you are still dangling somewhere in the middle,

26:07.363 --> 26:08.918
you haven’t yet touched that depth.

26:09.119 --> 26:13.684
Because once you get into that, you get completely drenched

26:13.964 --> 26:15.795
and lost.

26:15.996 --> 26:17.986
But if that is not the situation,

26:18.186 --> 26:21.877
that shows that you are still somewhere dangling in between

26:22.077 --> 26:25.813
and any time you can come high and dry.

26:27.470 --> 26:30.594
So you have to judge yourself.

26:31.770 --> 26:35.904
This is the time for you to judge you are in connection with Christ.

26:36.210 --> 26:38.036
He achieved His resurrection,

26:38.237 --> 26:41.322
by which we have to achieve our resurrection.

26:41.526 --> 26:43.828
But what have we done

26:44.036 --> 26:48.090
to achieve that resurrection which He has achieved?

26:48.499 --> 26:52.030
He intensely

26:52.280 --> 26:56.279
lived a life of complete sacrifice

26:57.678 --> 27:01.310
and complete concentration

27:03.107 --> 27:04.992
towards one goal:

27:05.192 --> 27:09.034
that He has to achieve the resurrection.

27:12.315 --> 27:15.995
Nothing else was important to Him.

27:18.787 --> 27:22.514
All that attention was on one thing

27:25.119 --> 27:29.628
that, “I have to achieve this resurrection.

27:29.829 --> 27:34.417
I have to get crucified and I have to be resurrected,

27:34.617 --> 27:38.984
because the whole world has to be resurrected.”

27:42.449 --> 27:45.245
But Sahaj Yogis,

27:45.730 --> 27:49.238
I don’t know how many think that way,

27:49.628 --> 27:53.720
how many think that dedication is needed.

27:54.845 --> 27:58.353
And the best part of it

27:58.720 --> 28:01.774
that it’s so joy-giving.

28:01.986 --> 28:05.424
Every step you move forward,

28:05.713 --> 28:08.494
it’s so joy-giving.

28:08.838 --> 28:13.166
This sinking in that well

28:13.521 --> 28:15.835
is so very joy-giving.

28:16.035 --> 28:19.702
It’s not painful, you don’t have to crucify yourself,

28:19.912 --> 28:24.436
you don’t have to carry the cross. He’s done it for you.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.796
So what do you sacrifice?

28:29.065 --> 28:32.518
Is your laziness!

28:35.780 --> 28:38.913
When it comes to the satisfaction of ego,

28:39.113 --> 28:42.147
people are overactive.

28:43.234 --> 28:45.511
They are like bullets then.

28:45.778 --> 28:49.739
And when it is the satisfaction of their physical comfort,

28:49.995 --> 28:52.916
they become – I don’t know.

28:53.997 --> 28:56.591
We had one rakshasa called Kumbhakarna,

28:56.791 --> 29:00.001
who used to sleep for six months

29:00.201 --> 29:05.208
and used to be awake six months.

29:05.408 --> 29:09.363
But here I see people sleep for twelve months,

29:09.564 --> 29:12.570
so what do you call them?

29:16.668 --> 29:20.381
Then they say, “Mother, we can’t keep awake!” Why?

29:20.644 --> 29:24.652
Because you are not meditating,

29:25.107 --> 29:28.102
you are not one with Christ.

29:29.285 --> 29:32.622
Then His agnya, He controls.

29:33.819 --> 29:36.873
With that Agnya, you cannot sleep.

29:37.739 --> 29:42.473
If His blessings are there on the Agnya, you cannot sleep.

29:42.746 --> 29:45.600
You won’t believe with the slightest light,

29:45.832 --> 29:48.617
artificial light specially, I can’t sleep;

29:48.867 --> 29:51.757
because still Christ is awake

29:52.148 --> 29:55.157
and I have to be awake.

29:58.396 --> 30:02.887
So you have to be awakened to this fact that we are Sahaj Yogis.

30:03.087 --> 30:05.332
We have a special responsibility

30:05.532 --> 30:08.183
as our connection with Christ is.

30:08.416 --> 30:13.851
Our main responsibility is, all the time, intensely, to think,

30:14.051 --> 30:18.500
“What we can do for the betterment of human beings?

30:21.235 --> 30:24.328
And what are we doing about it?”

30:26.812 --> 30:29.749
First I used to say, “Count your blessings,”

30:29.965 --> 30:33.376
because that was the best way to make people understand

30:33.576 --> 30:37.476
that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga.

30:41.397 --> 30:43.844
Now I would say, “Count your deeds.”

30:44.100 --> 30:47.311
What have you done for Sahaj Yoga?

30:47.592 --> 30:50.043
Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.

30:50.701 --> 30:53.055
To say that Paramchaitanya will look after you

30:53.280 --> 30:56.327
is absolutely absurd!

30:59.920 --> 31:02.407
If Paramchaitanya could do everything

31:02.641 --> 31:05.810
why should it create human beings?

31:08.697 --> 31:11.737
One Adam and Eve were sufficient.

31:14.368 --> 31:16.743
You have to do it.

31:16.984 --> 31:21.663
Unless and until you become deep,

31:21.864 --> 31:25.929
it cannot trigger, it is helpless.

31:26.603 --> 31:30.751
It’s only through you it is going to work out.

31:35.875 --> 31:40.462
Now if there is no instrument, electricity cannot work, can it?

31:41.063 --> 31:44.378
Now you should say, “The electricity itself must come before me

31:44.579 --> 31:48.117
and must do everything!”

31:50.698 --> 31:55.753
You have to have the instrument and you are the instrument

31:55.980 --> 32:02.093
and if you do not want to do it, how can Paramchaitanya do it?

32:02.673 --> 32:04.756
It will be something like saying, as I told you,

32:04.956 --> 32:09.634
that, “Let electricity do the job, we’ll not have any instrument.”

32:11.160 --> 32:13.824
Can I work it out?

32:14.373 --> 32:17.324
Can you work it out?

32:22.426 --> 32:27.535
So Paramchaitanya has its own style.

32:28.523 --> 32:32.414
It can only work if you people want to work it out.

32:32.726 --> 32:37.367
It’s an energy and you are the instrument.

32:39.748 --> 32:44.505
But the instrument is more busy with the job,

32:45.195 --> 32:47.570
with the family,

32:48.606 --> 32:52.137
all kinds of nonsensical things.

32:52.801 --> 32:58.786
Now supposing this instrument, which is meant for my lecture,

33:01.004 --> 33:04.097
forgets what it is

33:04.773 --> 33:08.059
and acts like a ladle in the kitchen

33:08.651 --> 33:12.678
because it’s fond of food, say, for example:

33:14.694 --> 33:18.843
then what’s the use of making this useless instrument?

33:19.077 --> 33:22.178
It doesn’t do what it has to do.

33:23.483 --> 33:28.256
It doesn’t know what it has been made for.

33:31.389 --> 33:37.224
It has no purpose at all. It’s such a useless stuff.

33:42.624 --> 33:47.236
So I feel there’s a kind of a lethargy,

33:47.437 --> 33:51.581
a kind of a very subtle lethargy working out,

33:55.175 --> 33:56.769
like this that,

33:56.969 --> 34:01.635
“We’ve done our job. Let the young people do it now!”

34:05.227 --> 34:07.743
You are matured,

34:08.017 --> 34:11.121
and the matured have to do the job.

34:16.282 --> 34:20.579
“We have done our level best!”.  What have you done so far?

34:30.389 --> 34:33.475
So much to be done still.

34:34.217 --> 34:37.146
And somehow or other

34:38.662 --> 34:40.085
we have to touch

34:40.340 --> 34:44.875
that area where such people remain like the yesterday’s player.

34:45.153 --> 34:48.457
He is not doing God’s work.

34:50.879 --> 34:53.803
He’s an artist

34:55.621 --> 35:00.480
and he’s working so hard to achieve perfection.

35:04.692 --> 35:08.583
He will get the same amount whether he’s perfect or not,

35:13.664 --> 35:15.725
but he’s practising at home,

35:15.968 --> 35:19.827
he’s listening to it, he’s trying to develop it.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.505
All the time working it out so that

35:23.798 --> 35:27.587
his performance should be excellent.

35:28.405 --> 35:30.880
So he’s seeking an excellence.

35:31.122 --> 35:35.177
Mediocrity has no place in Sahaj Yoga.

35:40.969 --> 35:43.602
Only through excellence you’ll enjoy.

35:43.805 --> 35:49.786
Only through excellence you will really become Sahaj Yogis.

35:51.606 --> 35:56.809
Otherwise, you could be a headache

35:57.504 --> 36:00.653
to me and to yourself.

36:04.003 --> 36:07.956
You would be a headache to Sahaj Yogis.

36:08.884 --> 36:12.111
A most non-progressive, destructive element

36:12.311 --> 36:17.572
I would say a person is who is not alert.

36:18.311 --> 36:21.327
You have to be aware,

36:22.031 --> 36:25.351
aware of your responsibilities.

36:25.648 --> 36:27.757
So far

36:28.347 --> 36:32.954
I have been saying that still the preparation is on,

36:33.169 --> 36:36.833
they have to correct themselves,

36:37.341 --> 36:40.348
they have to clear out themselves,

36:43.700 --> 36:49.676
they have to work it out, still their conditionings, this ego.

36:50.571 --> 36:55.376
But now, twenty years have passed

36:56.605 --> 36:59.340
and beware!

36:59.877 --> 37:04.166
Be aware that twenty-first year

37:04.487 --> 37:08.354
is going to be a very big jump.

37:08.815 --> 37:12.590
I’m warning you again and again and again and again.

37:13.278 --> 37:19.278
And you have to work very hard to develop yourself vertically

37:20.563 --> 37:25.066
in balance with your horizontal growth.

37:25.758 --> 37:29.137
It’s not my lecture for entertainment or anything,

37:29.371 --> 37:34.628
but should go to your heart, to your brain, to your being,

37:34.953 --> 37:38.355
as this is very important.

37:39.700 --> 37:43.268
And you are not going to waste it.

37:43.591 --> 37:47.104
All the time you have to think that you are a Sahaj Yogi

37:47.416 --> 37:52.206
and you have to know what you have to do in Sahaj Yoga

37:53.760 --> 37:56.635
and how to achieve it.

37:56.948 --> 37:58.967
You should not be satisfied

37:59.167 --> 38:02.839
unless and until you have achieved that excellence.

38:05.140 --> 38:08.290
That’s the very important, crucial point today

38:08.490 --> 38:12.156
I wanted to tell you because today is

38:12.562 --> 38:16.066
Easter Day which was a very crucial point

38:16.301 --> 38:20.429
for the development or the growth of the Spirit,

38:20.750 --> 38:23.812
because Sahasrara we could never have achieved

38:24.013 --> 38:27.078
if Agnya was blocked.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.208
Christ could have said,

38:32.408 --> 38:34.911
“All right, let Paramchaitanya do it!

38:35.111 --> 38:39.017
Let Paramchaitanya get itself hanged.

38:39.874 --> 38:42.749
Why should I do it?”

38:45.632 --> 38:51.084
He had to do it and He was the instrument and He’s done it.

38:53.185 --> 38:58.498
So Sahaj Yoga is not only for exploiters.

38:59.529 --> 39:05.316
If you try just to exploit Sahaj Yoga, you’ll be exploited too.

39:06.714 --> 39:09.843
But is for the exploitation of joy.

39:10.144 --> 39:14.675
But that’s only possible if you grow, you touch your depth.

39:14.927 --> 39:19.560
If you are not deep enough, you’ll hang in the air, as I said.

39:19.974 --> 39:24.073
And that has to be worked out, that has to be found out:

39:26.287 --> 39:30.297
how best you can do it, how much you can reach people,

39:30.498 --> 39:32.300
how many people you have given Realisation,

39:32.524 --> 39:36.288
how many people you’re going to help improve their health,

39:36.529 --> 39:40.188
their mental conditions and then

39:40.389 --> 39:44.282
how much you are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

39:47.743 --> 39:53.495
So that is going to work out what I call

39:53.979 --> 39:59.323
the collective ascent

40:02.245 --> 40:04.826
of human beings.

40:05.591 --> 40:08.724
May God bless you!

40:23.598 --> 40:28.152
To be in connection with Christ is to be

40:28.402 --> 40:32.371
enjoying your meditation.

40:41.258 --> 40:43.312
All right.

40:43.554 --> 40:49.312
So, puja is another thing which, I know it, helps you a lot.

40:50.773 --> 40:54.616
It gives you a definite push, I should say,

40:54.866 --> 40:57.709
but you don’t retain it.

41:00.069 --> 41:04.139
You don’t retain it. Then what’s the use?

41:05.369 --> 41:08.897
So also you have to retain,

41:12.988 --> 41:16.353
should have power to retain.

41:16.978 --> 41:20.132
That’s only possible if you have

41:21.259 --> 41:25.413
touched your depths, which you have.

41:28.194 --> 41:33.217
I am so happy to come back to you all.

41:34.037 --> 41:36.811
I missed you all very much.

41:37.131 --> 41:42.762
I’m travelling and working very hard.

41:45.262 --> 41:50.456
I don’t know if I work hard. I don’t think about it, never.

41:52.792 --> 41:57.440
So once you know that this is what you have to be,

41:57.690 --> 42:01.194
then you don’t work, it just works.

42:03.668 --> 42:08.858
Then you don’t think you are working.

42:10.242 --> 42:14.141
This is a subtle point you have to understand:

42:15.234 --> 42:18.843
that everything works out

42:21.052 --> 42:24.226
and you work in a way

42:27.157 --> 42:31.161
and it works out, but you don’t work.

42:33.556 --> 42:36.641
Like the Sun shines:

42:37.063 --> 42:40.453
if you ask the Sun, “Poor Sun, you have to work so hard!”

42:40.704 --> 42:45.326
He said, “When? When was that?”

42:46.326 --> 42:49.178
So you say, “You have to rise in the morning, then you have to…”.

42:49.420 --> 42:54.894
“No, no, no, no, no! I was just with myself, nothing else.

42:55.105 --> 43:00.066
I was with myself, I was enjoying myself. When did I work?”

43:02.818 --> 43:06.014
As long as you are with yourself

43:06.215 --> 43:08.695
there is no question of you getting bored

43:08.896 --> 43:11.939
or no question of you getting tired, nothing.

43:12.139 --> 43:15.281
You are with yourself, finished!

43:16.753 --> 43:20.617
But unless and until that happens within you

43:20.882 --> 43:22.509
then these problems do come up,

43:22.710 --> 43:27.111
and so please, please again I would say,

43:27.544 --> 43:30.559
value your Self-realisation,

43:31.466 --> 43:35.942
value your Realisation, value your life.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.716
You all are very precious people

43:38.917 --> 43:42.542
and you are the ones who are chosen.

43:46.096 --> 43:49.544
I hope all of you come to Sahasrara day

43:49.745 --> 43:55.645
after a very intensive meditative time.

43:59.560 --> 44:05.529
Otherwise suddenly I’ll find people who are doing Sahasrara puja

44:05.935 --> 44:09.169
with their all Sahasraras caught up.

44:12.594 --> 44:15.602
May God bless you!

44:58.230 --> 45:00.441
May God bless you.
