00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:09.510
Today is the third day of the Moon.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:33.484
Third day of the Moon is Tritiya,

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:44.450
is the special day for the virgins.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.298
Kundalini is the virgin desire.

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:58.184
It is virgin because it has not yet manifested itself.

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:11.892
And also, on the third center of Nabhi,

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:25.497
the virgins appear as shaktis of Guru.

00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:31.873
As we have got ten Gurus which we regard as the main Gurus

00:01:31.913 --> 00:01:54.851
they all had either their sister or daughter as their shakti.

00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:24.347
In the Bible it is said that, in the Old Testament, that

00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:36.352
the one who will be coming will be born of a virgin.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.237
And then the Jews would not accept Christ

00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:56.547
so they said that “It’s not written as virgin,
it’s written ‘the girl’.”

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.465
Now in Sanskrit Language ‘girl’
and ‘the virgin’ are one word.

00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:10.462
We did not have 80-year-old girls as we have nowadays.

00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:16.853
So the virginity of a woman meant

00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:22.941
that she was a girl who was not married as yet

00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:32.145
or who has not met her husband so far.

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:40.231
That is the essence of purity,

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:49.054
which was the power of the Guru Principle.

00:03:50.365 --> 00:04:04.931
So, for a Guru who is in charge of
leading others into enlightenment,

00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:15.021
has to know that his power is to be used
as a virgin power of pure power.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:23.307
A Guru cannot use his power

00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:35.063
in a way an ordinary person can use it.

00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:41.275
So his relationship with his disciples

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:50.105
whether they are boys or girls
has to be absolutely pure.

00:04:52.037 --> 00:04:57.074
The purity should be of such a limit

00:04:57.718 --> 00:05:07.687
that a Guru should not accept anything from the disciples.

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:18.882
About this, lots of things have been written by
many saints especially in Maharashtra.

00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:23.954
Also Kabirdas and Nanaka have clearly talked against the people

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.642
who have relationship with their shishyas, or disciples,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.506
either with greed or with lust.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:38.848
They have called them as rakshasas.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:48.040
In the same way the people who are today,

00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:55.526
supposed to be the leaders, the Gurus, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.457
have to remember that their relationship

00:06:02.584 --> 00:06:13.694
with their disciples has to be of complete
purity and virginity.

00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:22.010
In the olden days it was all right

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:30.636
that people did not know about the punishments
that can fall upon such a person

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:39.512
who uses his power as a Guru for his own gratification.

00:06:40.524 --> 00:06:48.546
But today at this time when at this time when...

00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:37.150
The punishment that can take place

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:45.121
in those days of last judgement could be very severe

00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:49.661
and as a Mother I have to warn all of you,

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:53.434
those who have started their centers

00:07:53.458 --> 00:08:03.323
or those who are becoming Gurus as leaders

00:08:04.126 --> 00:08:07.714
that you have to have a very detached mind

00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:15.095
and clear cut understanding within yourself.

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:18.655
You can not mishandle money.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.111
You can not misappropriate money,

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:28.804
you can not use anything for your own purpose

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:31.889
which belongs to the collective.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:44.224
Nor could you use anyone for the gratification of your lust.

00:08:44.453 --> 00:08:49.484
If you have any such weaknesses
is better to get out of Sahaja Yoga

00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:54.675
for the time being and come back when you are better off.

00:08:55.809 --> 00:09:00.856
There is no place in Sahaja Yoga for impure people.

00:09:01.032 --> 00:09:06.270
Purity is to be worshipped out and out.

00:09:08.655 --> 00:09:15.110
As we say that in the West there’s sin against the Mother.

00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:19.235
People don’t value their chastity

00:09:20.496 --> 00:09:26.371
but in the East, specially in India,

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:30.043
people don’t know that they have to be absolutely honest

00:09:30.068 --> 00:09:33.884
as far as their money is concerned.

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:40.008
They fall into traps, into temptations

00:09:40.312 --> 00:09:45.967
and then they get a very severe punishment,

00:09:46.023 --> 00:09:53.385
not through Me but through the wrath of God almighty

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:59.710
because this is God’s work we are doing.

00:10:02.616 --> 00:10:11.030
And the worst thing could be that we seek power.

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:17.783
If not these two things, we seek power in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:27.342
To them it becomes like their own domain

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:35.389
and they start using, asserting, their power over others.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:45.234
This cannot be possible.
It will not work out.

00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:53.325
Those who will try to dominate
others just for the satisfaction

00:10:53.350 --> 00:11:00.897
of their own ego will suffer a lot.

00:11:02.364 --> 00:11:12.135
Now the fourth type are the people who try
to put their conditionings on Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:16.560
Like somebody who is a Hindu

00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:23.166
and he is fasting say, most of the days they fast,
I don’t know which one is fasting.

00:11:23.498 --> 00:11:28.495
So he’s fasting say, on a Saturday

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:33.285
and he tells people that see now, I have to fast on Saturday

00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:39.511
because after all, you see, I have been fasting
for all these days and all that.

00:11:40.272 --> 00:11:46.496
Or who has got conditioning, like,
I would like to marry only a foreigner

00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:51.732
if I am a foreigner or if I am an Indian I’ll marry an Indian.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:58.756
All such conditions if a leader tries to put forward

00:11:58.764 --> 00:12:05.659
and saying that, “Mother said so,”
he’ll be doubly punished.

00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:29.063
We are belonging to the True Religion of a true, pure universality.

00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:37.357
None of these artificial things can bind us.

00:12:42.969 --> 00:12:50.678
This is one of the very important subtle things,

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:56.086
which we don’t understand –
that we are very much conditioned.

00:12:56.134 --> 00:12:59.999
“We the English”, “we the Indians”

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:09.658
or “We x,y, z”.

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:13.621
You are human beings.

00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:17.002
God made only one world.

00:13:17.404 --> 00:13:19.525
He didn’t make all these things.

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.902
It’s all artificial, man-made.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:28.565
You are born of one Mother

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.715
and you are yogis

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:37.302
who have no bondages of this artificial nature.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.181
Everyone who claims to be a Guru has to realise

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:53.445
that he can not bound himself to any particular mundane,

00:13:53.468 --> 00:13:57.388
outdated nonsensical ideas.

00:14:01.782 --> 00:14:09.068
Gradually whatever the leaders will do
will be followed by the followers.

00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:18.474
So the leader has to lead a life which is an ideal.

00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:25.922
A leader who is very dominating,

00:14:25.946 --> 00:14:29.033
or who is very possessive or aggressive,

00:14:29.054 --> 00:14:33.203
will create leaders who will be of the same nature.

00:14:33.228 --> 00:14:36.097
The another one who is very much conditioned

00:14:36.122 --> 00:14:41.240
will create conditioned followers.

00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:47.611
And may be, I may not find any relationship with them.

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:53.266
So we don’t want to have a priest class as Gurus.

00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:58.007
Priests are different from Gurus.

00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:05.509
We do not want people to take upon themselves the laws of God

00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:10.087
and use them for their own purposes.

00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:19.696
Today is the day of the Gurus

00:15:20.263 --> 00:15:31.503
because is the third day, the third Chakra of the Nabhi.

00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:43.194
The same one we have the starting point of the Mahalakshmi.

00:15:44.869 --> 00:15:53.352
Mahalakshmi energy starts

00:15:54.216 --> 00:16:01.750
working after you have finished with the Lakshmi tattwa.

00:16:03.104 --> 00:16:11.438
If the Gurus are still with,
busy with the Lakshmi tattwas,

00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:18.901
have no sense of sacrifice,
have no sense of detachment

00:16:19.571 --> 00:16:22.941
they cannot be called as leaders.

00:16:25.004 --> 00:16:33.182
The Mahalakshmi is the subtle form of our hankering,

00:16:33.874 --> 00:16:39.687
of our desires, is the subtlest, the epitome.

00:16:39.837 --> 00:16:47.315
Because first we search for power

00:16:47.942 --> 00:16:56.451
through physical, mental, emotional and ultimately

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:03.460
we want to have spiritual powers also to impress others.

00:17:04.745 --> 00:17:12.339
In Sahaja Yoga you come here to dissolve all your powers.

00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.265
You become so powerless

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:23.310
that all the powers of God Almighty
start working through you.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:28.286
Supposing this instrument has some powers (microphone)

00:17:28.905 --> 00:17:31.404
I won’t be able to handle this.

00:17:31.429 --> 00:17:35.031
It would be going here, there and there.

00:17:38.902 --> 00:17:46.345
So to worship Mahalakshmi one has to remember

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.844
that you must dissolve all your powers.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:55.680
That is the surrender that is what is ‘Islam‘ as they call it.

00:17:55.704 --> 00:17:58.875
But these are all words for people.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:03.832
Surrender is a very difficult thing to understand
for human beings.

00:18:03.857 --> 00:18:05.518
They think “I can’t surrender.”

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:11.565
What do you have to surrender, is nothing
but your ego and your conditioning.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.712
All these things I am telling you

00:18:14.752 --> 00:18:19.706
but if you learn them by heart like a parrot, you can repeat.

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:24.400
That will have no influence on your followers.

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:28.976
Unless and until you show in your own life

00:18:29.357 --> 00:18:42.632
that beauty, that composer, that
care, that concern, that love,

00:18:43.344 --> 00:18:48.790
nobody is going to listen to a parrot.

00:18:51.727 --> 00:18:59.776
The meaning has to come
from the practices not from the precepts.

00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:06.255
This is what Sahaja Yoga [is], which is very different

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:13.279
from any other spiritual announcements.

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:17.567
So be careful!

00:19:17.592 --> 00:19:27.074
You have been chosen by your merit as sahaja yogis,

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:31.566
so respect yourself.

00:19:32.169 --> 00:19:34.748
May God bless you!
