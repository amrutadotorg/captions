1
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:16,099
Today, we are all here assembled

2
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,099
in Turkey, in Istanbul,

3
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:25,939
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ

4
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:32,579
and, with that also, your celebration of your resurrection.

5
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:37,699
Christ's resurrection was a great message for us.

6
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,299
He won over the death

7
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:52,699
and came out of that dead body

8
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,099
with another body which was living body.

9
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:03,819
The body was the same, but one was a dead body

10
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:09,059
and another one was a body which was living.

11
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:16,259
It's not only symbolic, it actually happened within.

12
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:23,739
After all, He was a divine child, He was a divine person.

13
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,939
Actually it has happened within. It's not just a symbolic thing

14
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:36,459
that He died and He was resurrected into another person

15
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:40,939
or, you can say, into a living person.

16
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:52,699
For Him, what is the death? For eternal beings, there are no deaths.

17
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,619
There's no death for a person who's eternal.

18
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,859
He may, for the time being, look as if He is dead,

19
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,619
but He can never die.

20
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,739
Christ was like that, a very, very special incarnation,

21
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:16,699
which came on this earth to be reborn out of the dead.

22
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:23,019
Now we are also, when we are not yet realized souls,

23
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,339
when we are not yet enlightened.

24
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:34,179
We are also dead in the sense, our awareness is very, very...

25
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:40,859
I should say, absolutely dull and dead.

26
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,859
We can see flowers, we can see faces, we can see buildings,

27
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,939
we can see cities, we can see all those things.

28
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:55,139
All these things we see and we feel we are quite aware,

29
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,899
which we are not.

30
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:00,779
Actual awareness comes to us

31
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:04,139
when we cross the limits of our mind,

32
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:08,779
go beyond the mind, and this was only possible

33
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:13,419
because of the resurrection of Christ.

34
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:18,019
He resurrected Himself because He was a divine person.

35
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:26,339
But also we are resurrected because we are blessed by Divinity.

36
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:31,819
Now this mind of ours, which is in between,

37
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:38,499
is controlled by Shri Jesus Christ.

38
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:42,539
He controls through your Agnya, both the sides.

39
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,339
He controls your conditionings and He controls your ego

40
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:51,139
and brings a balance in you.

41
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:59,019
But when this Agnya Chakra starts sprinkling,

42
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:03,899
all sorts of ideas, sometimes reacting,

43
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:07,179
sometimes accepting conditionings...

44
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,299
it is a slave, it is not a free thing,

45
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:17,699
because it is working under the influence of your ego

46
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:20,939
or your superego.

47
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:28,019
For that is the death of our awareness,

48
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:34,699
that we cannot, we cannot understand something beyond.

49
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:40,299
That there exists a life beyond this, we cannot accept.

50
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,779
This is... We have seen now

51
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:50,619
that we were all in a condition that one was deadened.

52
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,259
We were feeling bad, we were feeling anxious,

53
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:57,139
we were fighting and we were thinking:

54
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,539
"There's something wrong with our present life."

55
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:07,259
There's something definitely which makes us slave,

56
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,019
by which we are slavish.

57
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:16,099
That we realized, no doubt, and we started seeking the Truth.

58
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,739
We started seeking the Truth in so many ways,

59
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,499
I know so many were... also went astray,

60
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:33,219
and they lost their balance and have fallen into a complete demise.

61
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,099
But so many of you have been salvaged,

62
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:44,419
have been saved by the great example of Christ's resurrection.

63
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,099
He had to venture it,

64
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,979
He had to do it and He worked it out.

65
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:56,219
Without Him, our Agnya would not have been that flexible.

66
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,779
As it is, the human beings

67
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,779
in the olden times were conditioned very much.

68
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:07,219
And when they have become modern, they are full of ego,

69
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,059
nothing in between.

70
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:12,779
With these two influences, we are imprisoned,

71
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,059
we are absolutely dead people.

72
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:21,379
We have no sensitivity for anything.

73
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,219
I've seen now... even today, you can see

74
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,739
about things are happening across,

75
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,979
is people are very anxious to kill each other.

76
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,579
Human beings want to kill human beings, can you imagine?

77
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:42,979
Such a stupid thing that we should kill our kith and kin.

78
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,419
Then, there are children who are killing,

79
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:51,619
parents that are killing, no relationship is accepted.

80
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,779
It's a sign of a person whose awareness is completely dead.

81
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,819
In our awareness, at least

82
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:04,299
we should have feelings of compassion and love.

83
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,779
But that one is lost, it's not there, we don't have it.

84
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:13,899
The whole world is a flame, when you read about

85
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,099
all the wars that are going on,

86
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,179
the way they are killing children,

87
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:23,579
the way they are destroying human beings.

88
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,539
It is a wrong attitude

89
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,019
that with destruction of human beings, things will improve.

90
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,819
It's a very, very wrong concept

91
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:42,099
that by destroying them, one can achieve something.

92
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:48,699
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say,

93
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:53,899
but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human beings

94
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,059
to destroy.

95
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:58,779
So you might ask then: "What to do, Mother?

96
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:03,339
What to do to stop this destruction?"

97
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,819
Answer is in the life of Christ.

98
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,899
You resurrect people,

99
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,339
you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them

100
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:17,339
to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong.

101
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:21,859
Let them feel, let them feel the compassion

102
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,659
and love that is within you.

103
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:28,779
When that starts, that third force within us starts acting,

104
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,699
our ego also comes down,

105
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,739
our conditionings also come down.

106
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,499
For example, if you think: "We are Muslims,

107
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,899
we have a right to kill others", if you think:

108
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:49,059
"We are Jews, we have a right to kill others."

109
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:52,179
All these differentiations and

110
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,019
this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid,

111
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,619
because you are human beings,

112
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,539
they are human beings.

113
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:06,939
You are killing human beings!

114
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:10,539
Not that they have committed any sin

115
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,619
or they have done anything wrong,

116
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,699
except that, in their foolishness, they believe that

117
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,859
they are this and they are that.

118
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:23,379
You are not! You are just human beings.

119
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:28,379
In every human being, as you know very well, there is Kundalini.

120
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:30,979
There's no discrimination, everyone,

121
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:36,059
whether you are a Muslim, a Jew, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsee,

122
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:40,139
anyone, you may call by any name.

123
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:46,579
Now just look at how we accept a certain denomination for ourselves!

124
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:50,339
You are born, say, to a Christian family

125
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,619
or you are born to a Hindu family:

126
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:58,219
immediately you start thinking you are there to uphold

127
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:05,979
all the flags of that religion in which you are born.

128
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,899
You are born in that religion without your knowledge,

129
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,979
without your permission, without any understanding.

130
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:17,419
So how can you belong to that religion?

131
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,459
You have got Kundalini, everybody else has got Kundalini.

132
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:26,339
So you can only belong to the religion of humanity,

133
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:29,299
where every human being has got Kundalini.

134
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,539
So, you are nothing but human beings.

135
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:33,739
All these false ideas, that:

136
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:36,459
"We are Hindus, we are Muslims, we are Christians",

137
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:42,859
is all man-created. I mean, man can create anything,

138
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,579
and human beings have no brain to understand

139
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,659
that is all man creating.

140
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:52,339
For example, you see in America,

141
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:57,299
they create associations and big organizations and all that,

142
00:18:57,459 --> 00:19:04,259
based on absolute falsehood, absolute wrong ideas,

143
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,539
absolute destructiveness, but they form it,

144
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:11,419
they form their groups, they have this, they have...

145
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:15,219
and they are prospering.

146
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,419
But it has a repercussion, they don't know.

147
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:25,219
If you start doing such false things against human beings

148
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:30,179
who are created by God, and nobody can destroy them,

149
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,779
then there are repercussions.

150
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:36,619
Many, many countries, who were, once upon a time, rulers,

151
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,899
were known as great things, have come down.

152
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,739
And all such countries who now think they are very rich

153
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:46,739
and all that, will have to come down.

154
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:51,099
All of them have to come down, is just an ultimate result

155
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:55,379
of this stupidity to believe that you are higher than others,

156
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,739
that you can kill others.

157
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,699
So, a non-violent method started

158
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,259
which is of another absurdity, I think,

159
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:15,019
because then they start saving mosquitoes and also the bugs,

160
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,979
while mosquitoes and bugs are,

161
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:23,499
you must know, are the greatest blood-suckers.

162
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:26,859
They live only on human blood.

163
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:31,099
Such things, what's the use of saving them?

164
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:38,659
So, human beings take to something that is absurd, stupid, foolish.

165
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,339
I don't know what is the reason.

166
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:46,059
The way they accept things is absolutely unbelievable.

167
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:49,899
I think it is a kind of a slavish mentality

168
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,659
which does not give them freedom

169
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,019
to think what is right, what is wrong.

170
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,019
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person

171
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:02,179
who was absolutely free,

172
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,539
free from all kinds of prejudices,

173
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:11,139
all kinds of temptations,

174
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,939
all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.

175
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,939
But one may say that: "Mother, after all, He was divine!"

176
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,979
He was divine and now you are made divine also.

177
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:32,579
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort,

178
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:37,459
a full effort, to tell people that:

179
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:43,219
"What are you doing? Why are you doing it?

180
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:46,019
What is the need to do such things?"

181
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,619
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction

182
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:57,259
through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction.

183
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:05,459
Take to drinking, take to other self-destructive things

184
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:08,379
which are immoral,

185
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,619
that's very easily available, and people like it very much.

186
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:18,019
They don't like when you talk that: "This is destructive."

187
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,859
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves.

188
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:29,299
Christ was destroyed by others and He resurrected by Himself.

189
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:32,139
So we are also in the same position now.

190
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,379
I know many a times Sahaja Yoga was challenged.

191
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:38,019
Now it's much better, not so bad...

192
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,299
was challenged and there were so many problems.

193
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:45,339
But now it's smoothing down,

194
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:48,819
because that's the Truth, that's the Reality,

195
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:50,979
that's what is Divinity.

196
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,619
So, you should not be afraid.

197
00:22:53,779 --> 00:23:00,299
All these funny ideas about Sahaja Yoga also will die out.

198
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:04,979
It's a resurrection, not only of you people,

199
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:09,699
but also of your ideologies.

200
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,979
Now the ideologies change,

201
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:16,259
that our awareness should be enlightened.

202
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,059
We should have light in our awareness.

203
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:22,379
This has come suddenly through Sahaja Yoga to people, that:

204
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,499
"If you don't have the light,

205
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,019
how can you go further in the right path?"

206
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,979
It's not easy to describe Christ's life, how He went through that.

207
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:40,659
He died so young and brutally He was killed.

208
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:45,579
But still all that, He resurrected Himself.

209
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:49,819
He came out of all that, came out of that ordeal.

210
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:53,619
So for us also, when we are in Sahaja Yoga problems,

211
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,739
we should know we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

212
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,939
No one can destroy us! No one can finish us off,

213
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:05,219
because we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

214
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:08,499
This special power that we have to resurrect,

215
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:14,139
you should all the time understand and feel it and meditate on that.

216
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,539
I hear from people from every country:

217
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,139
"The government is doing like this,

218
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,819
the government is doing like this!"

219
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:22,499
or they are having some trouble,

220
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:26,219
they call you a sect, they call you this and that...

221
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:28,619
Alright, doesn't matter!

222
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:30,819
Your duty is to believe

223
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:35,139
that you are following the footsteps of Christ.

224
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,979
And no one can destroy it!

225
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,699
This is the message of Christ's life,

226
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,859
that divine life cannot be destroyed.

227
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,099
When this body could not be destroyed,

228
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:52,419
then how can you destroy the divine light in Him?

229
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:54,579
So many Sahaja Yogis are here,

230
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:57,859
who have been since long in Sahaja Yoga,

231
00:24:58,019 --> 00:24:59,819
and they have had problems,

232
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:02,939
and they went through lot of troubles, I agree!

233
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:05,979
But all these things have subsided.

234
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:09,259
And now you are in such a resurrected position

235
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,139
that, after some time, -you'll be amazed-

236
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,339
Sahaja Yoga will take over, all over the world.

237
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,579
All over the world, people will take to Sahaja Yoga

238
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:24,699
and we'll have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis all over the world

239
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:30,819
that all this minority of some stupid people will disappear.

240
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,859
For that, what have you to do? Sometimes, people ask Me:

241
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:39,139
"What do we have to do?" You must have also read the Bible,

242
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,939
that Christ prayed and He was praying.

243
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,899
In the same way, we can say, we have to meditate.

244
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,019
Through meditation, we'll grow in our awareness,

245
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:57,859
in our new personality, in our strengthened personality.

246
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,099
Meditation is the only way we can grow,

247
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,419
and then no one can destroy you,

248
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:08,059
because you are all protected by the Divine Love.

249
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,379
You don't have to worry

250
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,259
as to who will destroy you, what will happen.

251
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,419
Of course, in the beginning there's little agitation,

252
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:18,299
people feel a little bad about it, it's alright!

253
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:22,539
But actually, NO ONE can destroy you.

254
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:24,619
Have this faith in you!

255
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,139
Christ had no organization;

256
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,859
He had no Adi Shakti to support Him, in no way.

257
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:36,299
But only through His divine personality,

258
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:39,379
He managed to get out of all the problems,

259
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:45,179
of all the tortures, of all the atrocities on Him.

260
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:48,019
So now, you have better advantage,

261
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,939
because you are enlightened.

262
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,899
Firstly, He was a divine person and He could go through that.

263
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,739
You don't have to!

264
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:58,979
Nobody will torture you, nobody will put you in jail,

265
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:00,939
nobody will crucify you.

266
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,579
Nobody will, that's not possible.

267
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:08,659
But mentally, if you are upset, sometimes you get upset I know,

268
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:11,259
in certain countries people get upset,

269
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:14,579
because they think they are oppressed because they are in Sahaja Yoga.

270
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:19,419
I assure you, no one can do that.

271
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:24,939
You must know that you are all the time protected.

272
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:30,619
Christ is there as your elder brother, I always said that.

273
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,139
But also you have your Mother,

274
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,339
and you have all the Ganas and all the Angels around you.

275
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:40,779
When I see this, I just thought: "Look at this,

276
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:47,219
in every country they have shown Angels and Ganas are there!"

277
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:51,059
Such pure forms of protection you have.

278
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:54,259
So there's nothing to worry about

279
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,619
your destruction or your impediments,

280
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,459
or whatever you may call it,

281
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:06,459
a kind of destructive forces acting on you.

282
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:12,459
From the life of Christ, you have to know that no one can destroy

283
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,139
a realised soul in these modern times.

284
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,219
As it is, they never destroyed.

285
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:22,659
We had so many Saints who were killed, who were tortured,

286
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:27,099
but see, they still exist as poetry, as poems,

287
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:35,539
also as blessings, everywhere they are not finished.

288
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:39,179
They are not dead, though it seems that they are no more,

289
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:46,859
but even to take their names and even to call them, they work out.

290
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:50,979
They are there in their Spirit and they help.

291
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:54,419
Assured by Christ's life,

292
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:59,659
by His resurrection, we are resurrected people.

293
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:03,379
Of course, our body also has changed.

294
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,739
After resurrection, you know that your Chakras work out

295
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:11,579
all the curing and all the blessings.

296
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:15,299
Our attitude, our mental attitude also changes,

297
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:18,419
and also your ego subsides.

298
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:21,779
Not only that, also our conditionings go out.

299
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:26,179
Specially I was so happy that those people, say,

300
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,539
who are born in a particular religion,

301
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:32,059
immediately they see what's wrong with that religion,

302
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:37,419
as if they turn round and see the image of their society

303
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,339
and know what's wrong with them.

304
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:45,219
And when they start meditating on those corrections,

305
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:49,099
it works, societies are improving.

306
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:54,099
You see, so-called religious ideas are falling into their own traps,

307
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,379
and they will all fall because they're falsehood.

308
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,099
That's not real religion.

309
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:03,619
The religion is within ourselves and this pure religion

310
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,259
is the one which is a global religion.

311
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:12,899
The solution comes like that: supposing you have wars...

312
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,939
wars in the name of religion,

313
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,579
in the name of God specially.

314
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,899
And in the name of religions they have wars.

315
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,379
So now, what happens?

316
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:36,819
All these wars that take place cannot destroy Reality,

317
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:39,019
cannot destroy the Truth.

318
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,499
This is another message of Christ's resurrection.

319
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,019
You cannot!

320
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:47,419
You may think that today you have destroyed these people,

321
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,379
but they are there.

322
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:55,379
All the Saints, all the great people

323
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:02,259
who have been resurrected in life are all the time there.

324
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:05,819
Their protections are there, their guidance is there,

325
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:11,979
you can see them in a way that they are there.

326
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:19,939
So one should have no fear. The fear of death has to go.

327
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,339
So many of them have said the same

328
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:24,339
that: "What is death after all?"

329
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:29,139
Death dies itself, once you are resurrected.

330
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,059
So one should not be afraid of death.

331
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:35,779
Now how many of you have been afraid of death

332
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:39,379
before your resurrection, but not now?

333
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:43,099
You are not bothered as to when the death comes, what happens

334
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,819
or which way you are going to be so-called destroyed.

335
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:50,059
You know you cannot be destroyed.

336
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:53,339
In your heart of hearts, you all know this very well,

337
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:57,019
that you cannot be destroyed.

338
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:05,939
The fear of our destruction goes away, no doubt.

339
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,139
But there is one thing, is the compassion.

340
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,459
When you see all these bad things are happening

341
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:18,299
and people are being tortured, your mind is... you see...

342
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,699
cannot take it for granted.

343
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:25,459
It starts responding to that,

344
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:31,099
and it feels the pain of others, tremendous!

345
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,899
But as a result of that, your will power,

346
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,779
your thinking on those lines, your tears even are powerful

347
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:44,019
and they can bring solace to those people

348
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,459
who are suffering unnecessarily.

349
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:51,339
You have to experiment with it.

350
00:32:51,499 --> 00:33:02,219
Just having a feeling of compassion and love, things will improve.

351
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:06,539
Now, as it is, we meditate.

352
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:12,019
But we can meditate also with such compassion

353
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:18,619
and such love that your tears can also have an effect

354
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,179
on these people who are so cruel

355
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:25,179
and stupid and killing each other.

356
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:30,299
But it is important for you to know that now

357
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:33,859
you are not an individual, but you have become a global personality,

358
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,259
a global personality.

359
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,659
You are not an individual, you are a global personality,

360
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:47,019
and sitting down here, you are working out all the global problems.

361
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:49,939
You are not a small person now,

362
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:52,139
who's only worried about your own children,

363
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,659
about your family, about this and that, no!

364
00:33:55,819 --> 00:34:00,499
This mind of yours has expanded, expanded like this,

365
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:07,139
that it works automatically for all the problems of the world.

366
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,979
When for a woman I read newspapers,

367
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,859
specially women seldom read newspapers,

368
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,499
they think it's stupidity to read those papers.

369
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,419
But I read, I read and I read those where My attention is in it.

370
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:26,099
I've seen it works! But all of you put together, if you understand

371
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:29,499
that this is your responsibility to correct

372
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:35,779
all the destructive forces, to put them right,

373
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:40,139
we just have to collectively meditate on the points

374
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:44,099
where you find there's a big problem.

375
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:48,899
Now the problem mainly is because of religions, mainly.

376
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:52,459
Now, if they can all jump into the new religion,

377
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,899
global religion, they all are one.

378
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:00,459
They cannot then fight because there's one religion.

379
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,659
But they don't want to have one religion,

380
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:05,499
because they want to fight. They're fighting cocks.

381
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:10,779
But if they come to Sahaj, if they become enlightened,

382
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:14,619
then they will only enjoy love of each other

383
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,579
and not killing of each other, destruction of others.

384
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:23,939
And this is what we have to learn from life of Christ,

385
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:25,859
who was alone, who was single.

386
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:28,379
He did not have such a collective behind Him.

387
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:32,819
But how powerful He was that He fought the death

388
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:37,699
and came out of it so clearly at the stage of Agnya!

389
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,219
Without Him, we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

390
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:43,659
Kundalini would not have gone through,

391
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:46,379
unless and until He had sacrificed His life.

392
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:48,379
And He readily sacrificed,

393
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:53,419
He accepted the task of sacrificing His life,

394
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,499
and then resurrected.

395
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:58,619
He passed through that, I should say,

396
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:02,179
a very constricted channel of Agnya,

397
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:09,619
to put you people right, by saying: "You forgive everyone."

398
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:12,459
If forgiving was such a powerful thing

399
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:16,579
that you can even fight your death, then why not forgive?

400
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,139
Many people say: "Mother, we can't forgive!"

401
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:20,819
and I've told hundred times that:

402
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:24,339
"What are you doing if not forgiving?"

403
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:28,179
So, the message of Christ's life is that He forgot,

404
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:31,259
forgave all the people who troubled Him.

405
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:34,699
Even He said that: "O God, please forgive them,

406
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,379
because they don't know what they are doing!"

407
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:43,499
On the cross, He said those things, when He was tortured, insulted,

408
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,219
He's saying what? "You forgive them,

409
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:49,499
have pity, have sympathy for them,

410
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:52,859
because they don't know what they are doing!" They are killing

411
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:55,819
the Son of God, and what will happen to them?

412
00:36:55,979 --> 00:37:00,459
Where will they go? What will be their situation?

413
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:08,459
This one is a big message for us,

414
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,499
that even on the cross, He said: "Forgive,

415
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:16,419
O God, O Father, forgive them!"

416
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:20,499
In the same way, we have to also forgive people.

417
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:26,379
It's very important from the life of Christ that we have to forgive.

418
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:32,179
His forgiveness was of the greatest importance.

419
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:35,339
For the whole world to understand, you must forgive.

420
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:38,339
If you learn how to forgive, you'll be amazed,

421
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:41,819
half of the wars of this world will be finished!

422
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:45,099
Now, something happened thousands of years back.

423
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:49,379
Still people are fighting, still they are fighting,

424
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:52,139
thinking these things happened so many years back,

425
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:54,939
so they are our ennemies.

426
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:59,619
If He can really forgive those people,

427
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:04,899
what happened before we were even born,

428
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:10,419
why should we form a group of such people, why?

429
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:15,739
Because there is something called hatred in human beings,

430
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:20,539
they have hatred, hatred for this, hatred for that,

431
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:24,859
even in small things they'll say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

432
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,419
It's very common,

433
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,099
nowadays specially.

434
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:37,059
When we were young, we were not supposed to say such a thing:

435
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:40,539
"I don't like it, I like it!",

436
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,459
we were not supposed to say.

437
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:46,379
But now their freedom has given them to talk like this:

438
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:48,899
"I don't like it, I don't like that,

439
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:54,419
I don't like that, I don't like that person!" Who are you?

440
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:58,699
What do you think of yourself to judge others?

441
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,819
You don't know how to appreciate,

442
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:02,819
you don't know how to enjoy

443
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:05,579
and only what you go on is: "I don't like it!"

444
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:08,499
And supposing you like it, what will you do?

445
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:13,019
Whether you like it or don't like is just the same!

446
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:16,059
But just to show off their ego, we say:

447
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:21,459
"I don't like this way, I don't like!"

448
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:25,419
Because there's no love!

449
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:31,659
If there is love, then you can enjoy everything.

450
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:35,539
We'll never say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

451
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:42,419
You will definitely enjoy if you really say

452
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:46,419
that: "I enjoy, I enjoy everything!"

453
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:49,259
You are closing down yourself by saying:

454
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:53,619
"I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like!"

455
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:55,819
as if you are a great connoisseur,

456
00:39:55,939 --> 00:40:00,779
or a person, a judge, to say this!

457
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:06,139
It is very remarkable that in the West it's even more prominent

458
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:09,819
that they will say: "I don't like it, I don't like!"

459
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:12,939
Of course, in the East, I would say in India,

460
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:15,099
if somebody says like that, people will say

461
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:18,419
he's just trying to show off. On the face!

462
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:25,779
But showing off is not regarded as bad manners.

463
00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:28,779
It's not regarded as bad manners in the West.

464
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:33,419
To feel shy of anything is regarded as bad manners,

465
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:40,779
but to boast of something, nobody feels that it is a bad thing.

466
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:44,739
Did Christ boast of anything? Never!

467
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:48,059
He never boasted of anything,

468
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:56,139
but when He saw people were selling things in the holy places,

469
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:57,899
what did He do?

470
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,259
He started beating them with a hunter,

471
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,259
because that was wrong, absolutely wrong,

472
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:08,539
against the holiness of the place.

473
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,179
But He did not say: "I don't like it!" No!

474
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:17,339
He just showed His complete disapproval

475
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:20,699
of the whole system of selling things

476
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:25,739
in the temple or in a holy place.

477
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:28,579
People go there to worship.

478
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:35,379
They need a mind which is devoid of money orientation.

479
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:44,779
There should be no money orientation when you are meditating.

480
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:48,339
This is the biggest problem of today.

481
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:51,899
Everything is money orientation.

482
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:58,099
You like a car which is very expensive, so you want to have.

483
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:01,579
By hook and crook, you will get that car and sit in there.

484
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:08,979
You might be a thief, but you buy an expensive car to show off,

485
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:13,339
perhaps maybe because you are a thief, that's why you want to hide

486
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:15,619
your personality.

487
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:20,619
So there is no truthful life, it's all just showing off

488
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:22,939
and thinking no end of yourself.

489
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:29,099
But when the death will come at your doorstep, what will you do?

490
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:34,579
At that time, you will be trembling

491
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:38,059
with all your so-called achievements

492
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,979
and your so-called showing off.

493
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:43,939
You will just tremble before death.

494
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:47,459
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot!

495
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:52,539
He will like, if the death has to come, it has to come!

496
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:58,299
He will not tremble that the death is something dangerous,

497
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:01,619
but is a place where he can go and rest.

498
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,059
He won't mind, he won't mind anything,

499
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:10,459
because he is above that, he is above destruction.

500
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,859
So, he won't mind anything, whatever comes his way

501
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:18,579
and he will surrender to it easily.

502
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:22,419
We have Kabir. Kabir has written so many poems,

503
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:27,539
mostly about death.

504
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:32,539
He said: "When death came, I didn't say a single word,

505
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:35,979
I didn't fight, but what I did,

506
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:42,499
I took a sheet on top of me and went off to sleep!"

507
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:45,539
How sweetly he described death sometimes,

508
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:49,579
and Kabir then reminds Me of Christ.

509
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:54,939
How sweetly Christ also went through all these things,

510
00:43:55,139 --> 00:44:03,259
and when He died, the whole elements shook.

511
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:06,179
He was the master of elements.

512
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:07,579
They shook,

513
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:12,059
there was earthquake and all kinds of things that happened.

514
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:16,779
They, they felt His death, not Him!

515
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:21,099
They felt that such a great divinity

516
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:29,819
which is the essence of existence has been killed like this.

517
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:33,859
They also didn't know that He is going to come back to His life.

518
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:36,979
They also were not aware of it, but He did.

519
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:42,139
He did come out of that deadening thing, for which

520
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:46,659
everybody was so much shocked.

521
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:52,979
His death itself gives us strength,

522
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:56,939
that we have no death, we have resurrected

523
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:01,339
and resurrection is with us.

524
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,339
But we have to establish,

525
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:08,459
we have to establish our Sahaja Yoga, our meditation.

526
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:10,299
That's very important.

527
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:13,099
The other day, I met a lady.

528
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:18,379
She told of a miracle in her life, how she was saved.

529
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:24,019
She was about to die, she came across an accident, all kind...

530
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,459
But how she was saved, while her husband,

531
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,859
he succumbs to all kinds of things. So I said:

532
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:34,459
"What do you mean, how it happened?" She said:

533
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:38,139
"Mother, it's nothing but Shraddha!"

534
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:43,259
Shraddha is dedication, surrendering.

535
00:45:43,419 --> 00:45:48,579
"Surrendering, because I'm surrendered!"

536
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:53,019
But I said: "How?" "That, I don't know, I'm just surrendered.

537
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:59,379
I feel so comfortable, so lively and so much out of fear

538
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:01,739
when I know I'm surrendered,

539
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:04,859
completely surrendered to my Spirit!"

540
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:07,419
And this what it is what we have to learn

541
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:10,859
when we meditate, that we have to surrender.

542
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,539
Muhammad has called "Islam". Islam means surrender,

543
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:17,699
though they don't surrender -otherwise you see...-

544
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,579
but what is that you must surrender

545
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:26,779
to your global nature, to your higher nature.

546
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:30,339
You must not die out,

547
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:32,579
you must not fizzle out

548
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:37,859
into these worldly turmoil and worldly things.

549
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:43,699
It's a very strength-giving example of Christ.

550
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:48,819
And He's with us, He will always guide us, He'll look after us,

551
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,859
not only but He'll give us strength.

552
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:57,979
He will destroy all those who will be against eternal life.

553
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:00,179
He'll destroy nonsensical things.

554
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:05,259
And you are seeing now how in Kali Yuga all these institutions

555
00:47:05,419 --> 00:47:10,099
who talk of religion and fights are getting destroyed.

556
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,939
Automatically, we have done nothing.

557
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:17,419
On their own only, while they're doing, they are finishing,

558
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,859
because there's no Reality, there's no Spirit in it,

559
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:27,899
and without the Spirit, what is left is nothing but a dead body.

560
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:33,099
The whole understanding should be for Sahaja Yogis,

561
00:47:33,259 --> 00:47:37,499
that we have to be Spirit-oriented,

562
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:43,419
not money-oriented, body-oriented, emotion-oriented,

563
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:45,619
but Spirit-oriented,

564
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,059
which is a joy-giving thing.

565
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:51,819
And you'll be surprised with that orientation,

566
00:47:51,939 --> 00:48:00,259
you will be the most happy, most loving,

567
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:04,739
most beautiful person.

568
00:48:04,899 --> 00:48:07,139
Immediately, people will know around

569
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:10,299
that there's something about this man, some spark

570
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:16,779
about this lady, some sort of a spark that she is or he is

571
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:23,059
so much different from us. It can be recognized in no time.

572
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:29,339
Now, at the time of Christ, very few people could recognize,

573
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:32,699
because they were not enlightened,

574
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:39,979
because they were very much below the level of human beings,

575
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:42,859
I should say. But you are not!

576
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:47,019
You are quite aware, you are born in modern times,

577
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:49,939
and at this time, when we think of Christ,

578
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,459
we should know what a life it was,

579
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,939
what a grand personality it was,

580
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:59,699
that He subjected to this kind of a torture.

581
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:02,459
He could have destroyed all of them in no time.

582
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:06,459
He was so powerful, such a powerful personality,

583
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:10,859
but He did not! He forgave them.

584
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:13,699
He gave you the message of forgiveness,

585
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,619
the greatest force that can work out.

586
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:19,139
Now also, you should surrender yourself

587
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:24,459
to this idea of forgiveness and really try to forgive.

588
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:28,299
You'll be amazed, you will feel very much peaceful, very happy,

589
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:33,379
and the person who has tortured you will come round.

590
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:38,619
What we have to do is now to transform people. That's our job.

591
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:41,379
We have to transform them. We are transformed.

592
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:44,419
We are at a point, we can call it, we are resurrected.

593
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,859
We have to resurrect the whole world, that's our job,

594
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:51,379
so that all these fights, all these quarrels,

595
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:55,899
all these falsehoods will just be finished.

596
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:59,779
For us, Christ is our leader, who has done this for us.

597
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:01,699
He came as an ordinary human being,

598
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:03,779
lived like an ordinary human being,

599
00:50:03,939 --> 00:50:06,339
with all these powers within Him.

600
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:08,779
He never used them to destroy.

601
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:13,699
In the same way, we can also with love and affection,

602
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:18,659
we can also really come out of our deaths,

603
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:21,059
come out of our misgivings,

604
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:24,539
come out of our destructive nature.

605
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:31,059
This destructive nature is the most dangerous thing for Yogis.

606
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:37,779
That's the only hope we have, that Sahaja Yogis are resurrected.

607
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:42,259
Only thing I know is that,

608
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:47,219
if we have so many Sahaja Yogis, this world will change.

609
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:49,059
This world has to change.

610
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:51,539
But your progress should go on,

611
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:56,339
you should progress more and more, not you should not regress back.

612
00:50:56,499 --> 00:50:59,219
For small things here and there, don't worry!

613
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:02,139
You have a very great responsibility,

614
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:07,619
and that responsibility is to transform the human beings.

615
00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:12,699
That's your due. How many have you transformed?

616
00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:18,059
How many have you changed? It's all right for men or women.

617
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:21,379
You have to change people, this is your job

618
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:25,059
and this is the power you have got from Christ,

619
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:28,379
that you have to change them, transform them

620
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:31,939
into the new world of happiness and joy

621
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:38,379
which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma.

622
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:42,219
If it works out, if it really works out,

623
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:47,099
think of the world, how beautiful it will become for us!

624
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,859
It's the duty of every Sahaja Yogi

625
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:55,139
to go into this kind of a new venture

626
00:51:55,299 --> 00:52:00,379
and try to find out how many people he can convert

627
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:03,459
and how many people he can bring round.

628
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:07,379
I hope next time we'll have doubled the number of people

629
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:11,699
that are here from all these eight countries who are hosting now.

630
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:14,179
All My love to you all.

631
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:18,819
Great days are waiting us.

632
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:24,699
We have to now understand only our responsibility.

633
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:28,379
Main thing is how many people we have converted,

634
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:30,899
how many people we have resurrected.

635
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:33,699
That is the record, not what,

636
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,099
how many Pujas you have attended and all that.

637
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:37,539
It's not so important.

638
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:41,179
Pujas are just to give you strength and to give you power,

639
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:45,379
but they are not your work. That's not your work.

640
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:47,899
For your work, you can take from Pujas

641
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:49,779
all the strength that you need.

642
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:55,299
But if you don't use this power, then what's the use?

643
00:52:55,779 --> 00:52:58,419
So now, I leave it to you to remember

644
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:02,339
that you are resurrected and you have to resurrect others.

645
00:53:02,499 --> 00:53:04,779
It's a very, very important job

646
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:09,459
at this time of complete turmoil and destruction.

647
00:53:09,459 --> 00:53:12,299
May God bless you!
