00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.417
August 4th, 1991, Denize, Belgium

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:08.333
Today, we have assembled here

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:14.333
to do puja to Buddha.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:23.041
As you know Buddha was a son of a king.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:32.125
And one day He was shocked to see a very poor man,

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:36.041
thin man, walking on the street, very unhappy person,

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:45.125
and He felt very sad about it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.667
Then He saw one person who was

00:00:54.125 --> 00:01:00.041
very sick and about to die.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:06.250
Then He saw a man

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.625
who was dead and people were carrying him

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:17.041
to the cremation ground.

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.083
This all upset Him very much

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.625
and He started thinking about it

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.250
and seeking what is the reason

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.041
for all these happenings in human beings.

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:36.166
Firstly, why do they become so

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:46.041
miserable or sick,

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:51.166
or, why do they die so miserably?

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:58.041
The reason He found out in His search.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.709
He went round the whole world, I should say, in the sense:

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.291
He read Upanishads, [UNCLEAR]  went to many gurus,

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:10.041
went to many places of spiritual education,

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:13.250
Benares, everywhere He went.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:18.250
And ultimately, He was sitting under a banyan tree

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.500
when suddenly His kundalini was awakened by Adi Shakti

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.208
and He got His realization.

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:33.333
Then He realized that the reason for all this is the desire.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:41.333
In Sahaja Yoga, we have now understood

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:47.333
that all other desires are not pure desires.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:55.041
Firstly, whatever desires are fulfilled,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.041
we are not satisfied by it, first thing.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:04.166
And secondly, all these desires have a repercussion.

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:12.250
So what is the pure desire?

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:16.333
That, you all know, is the kundalini.

00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.208
Kundalini is the power of pure desire,

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:25.458
which fulfils your pure desire to be the spirit,

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:29.208
to be Buddha, to be enlightened.

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:34.041
Buddha means a person who is enlightened.

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:38.208
So Gautama becomeâ€¦ became Buddha,

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:43.041
as you people now have become Sahaja yogis.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.709
But because He went through all these various penances,

00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:59.041
whatever He learned became part and parcel of Him,

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:03.041
but in Sahaja Yoga it is all sahaj.

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:09.000
So we always conclude everything that "This is, after all, sahaj."

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:13.291
And when we try to work out anything,

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:16.333
we always say, "Oh, it will work out spontaneously.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.083
It's all right, Mother will do for us everything."

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:27.041
This is a common failing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.125
So whether to put you all through that long process

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:38.250
or to give you realization was a question before Me.

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:43.041
Because, in these days of confusion

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:48.041
there cannot be much time to put you through all which

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.083
Buddha had gone, and He was one individual, I had to put all of you.

00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:55.291
That would have been very difficult.

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:58.291
I don't know how many would have sustained it.

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.250
Most of them would have dropped out half way,

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:04.125
or maybe quarter of the way.

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:11.125
So it was done in a sahaj manner.

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:15.166
You did not have to sit in a banyan tree.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.041
Ultimately you got your realization.

00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:21.333
Your kundalini was awakened

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:26.041
and you got your enlightenment.

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:29.625
But that enlightenment which settled in Buddha,

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:32.667
is not settled in us because

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:38.083
our chakras were not cleansed as He had cleansed His chakras.

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:44.250
We had the same body, the same mind

00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:50.125
and the same attitude when we got realization.

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.625
As we were looking at the house of God,

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.291
still we are looking at the house of God,

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:01.375
but you have entered inside the house and you have to

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:04.041
look out from the windows.

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:06.208
This you forget.

00:06:07.542 --> 00:06:11.333
And though we are sitting now on a hilltop

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:15.291
out of all the congestion and

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:21.041
all the traffic, still you see a car, you get frightened.

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:25.041
You don't know you are sitting on top of a hill

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:28.125
where your Mother has put you nicely.

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:34.083
And that is how you try to behave.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.041
When I get reports about Sahaja yogis,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.166
I am quite amazed that they do not know

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:43.125
that they are realized souls now.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.375
That's why Buddha talked of desirelessness.

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:52.125
It's not possible before realization,

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:56.291
even after realization I find it's difficult.

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:02.041
Some sort of a subtle desire exists

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:09.375
and where you have to work it out, you do not work it out,

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:13.583
saying that "Our ego will be catching."

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:16.583
So wherever it suits us we work that way,

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:20.125
wherever it suits we work this way.

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:28.041
The solution of the whole thing is one

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:31.125
which I have found out Myself, was this:

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:35.000
that it's a collective happening.

00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:46.166
A person who is an individual can never get over his ego.

00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:51.375
Individualistic person cannot get over his ego.

00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:54.208
The one who lives individually,

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.625
wants to enjoy everything individually,

00:07:57.083 --> 00:08:00.083
can never get over his ego because

00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.333
you have not gone through all that penances.

00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:06.542
Or else, if you are an individual

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:09.375
then you better go through all these penances

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.333
and then come back.

00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:19.041
So the solution is to wash all our chakras,

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:25.250
cleanse our life in the collective,

00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:30.000
and this is what was

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:36.667
the solution of the problem of ego.

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:41.417
Formerly, everybody worked out individually.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.083
Like they had to go to Himalayas, take some guru,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.709
then the guru would throw him out.

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.250
Then he would go to another guru,

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:51.166
then work there, then he'll throw it out.

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:55.250
Then next life he'll be born again; again he'll be thrown out.

00:08:57.125 --> 00:09:00.250
Ultimately, if one guru accepts, all right, very well.

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:04.083
He's beaten up, he's tortured, he's treated every way,

00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.250
hanged upside-down. And then ultimately,

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:14.458
if any guru gets nearer to any one individual,

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:18.333
he would give him realization. This was the situation.

00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:25.000
But in Sahaja Yoga, the door is open anybody can come in,

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:29.333
anybody. Get your realization.

00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:35.333
Because I have faith in collectivity,

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:42.166
this collective life will definitely

00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:50.166
give you what Buddha got through His individual efforts.

00:09:53.542 --> 00:10:00.125
But there also we fail that we do not know how to be collective.

00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.709
Individualism is all the time around us.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:08.417
In every way we think of individuals.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.333
Wherever collectivity has worked, Sahaja Yoga has prospered;

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:20.125
and wherever it has not worked, there has been a problem.

00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:29.041
So it is very important that we should look at ourselves,

00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:35.041
and see for ourselves and see how much collective we are.

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:38.667
Do you enjoy collectivity, or not?

00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:44.041
Are you aiming at collectivity, or not?

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.333
As soon as I thought of this Cabella

00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:56.041
place you have seen, and I thought I'll make

00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:59.041
a little ashram there, near the river, for you.

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.625
Immediately people said, "Mother is it all right

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:07.083
if we buy our own houses here?" Immediately.

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:12.375
Then what is the purpose?

00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:17.709
And then they will call Me,

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.041
"Mother please come to my house for dinner.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.583
Please come to my little house for some tea."

00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:27.291
I'm not interested.

00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:40.166
So in Sahaja Yoga, unless and until you really become collective in

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:43.333
every sense, you cannot ascend and you cannot wash yourself,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.333
you cannot cleanse yourself.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.583
This point He did not say, but in a way He did say

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:56.083
because He has said, "Buddham sharanam gacchami."

00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:01.250
First I surrender myself to my Self-realization.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.625
Then He said, "Dhammam sharanam gacchami "

00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:11.041
means the dharma in me, I myself surrender to that dharma.

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:16.041
That is spirituality.

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:20.000
And thirdly He said,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.417
"Sangham sharanam gacchami."

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.041
Sangha means collectivity,

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:35.166
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:42.041
But He did not know how to give en-masse realization at that time.

00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:45.333
So He got hold of disciples

00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:49.375
who had to shave off their heads,

00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:52.250
whether you are a queen or a king;

00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:58.333
who had to wear only one cloth, whether you are a man or a woman;

00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:01.333
who had to have

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:08.542
only one mat to sleep in a big hall.

00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:15.041
No husband and wife, no marriage, nothing.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:23.083
And they had to beg their food in the village

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:28.333
and feed the guru and also they themselves

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:34.166
had to eat that food, whether it was sufficient or not.

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:43.125
That is not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:49.166
Everything is enjoyable in Sahaja Yoga from the very beginning

00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:55.333
and you are supposed to be

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.250
absolutely joyous people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:06.041
That is there. But the joy of the collectivity

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.208
if you do not know how to enjoy,

00:14:10.542 --> 00:14:15.291
then you cannot ascend, because there's no other way out.

00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:17.125
What is the other penance?

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:20.333
For some people even collectivity is a penance

00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:23.417
till they start enjoying it.

00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:30.041
And they are very troublesome; "This is not good," very critical.

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:31.667
Some of them stay in the ashram

00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:33.375
and criticize everything all the time.

00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:38.125
"This is not good. I don't like this, I don't like that."

00:14:41.166 --> 00:14:44.166
So here, in complete awareness,

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:45.667
I mean you cannot be mesmerized.

00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:49.333
If you are mesmerized then you can live whatever way you like.

00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:53.375
But in complete awareness and full understanding

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:57.166
we have to become collective.

00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:06.125
This is one of the solutions for our cleansing.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:16.250
We can say like this: supposing My hands are dirty,

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:23.166
so I go to one tap and I find there is one drop coming,

00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:25.500
so I can't wash.

00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:30.166
So I go to another place, there's no water.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:37.333
Third place I find there's nothing available.

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:42.125
Ultimately, I reach the place where I find some water.

00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:45.041
Then I wash Myself completely,

00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:48.417
because I know I can't find it anywhere else.

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:56.250
But in Sahaja Yoga, you are immersed

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:02.083
in the water of collectivity.

00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:10.041
If you enjoy this collectivity and can swim in that,

00:16:10.542 --> 00:16:13.208
then there's no problem.

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:25.083
Buddha, as you know, is working on our right side, on our Agnya.

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:29.333
Is very surprising, the Deity like Him,

00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:34.041
to work on the right side.

00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:38.375
First He said, for the right side, you should be detached,

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.208
desireless.

00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:46.041
I mean, nobody would work if they have no desire

00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:52.250
and if they have no way of earning something out of it,

00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:56.041
I mean, in the normal sense.

00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:02.125
But desirelessly you have to work.

00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:11.125
Then only the right side can be conquered very symbolic.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.417
Normally the right-sided people are extremely thin,

00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:18.041
but Buddha is very fat.

00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:23.125
Normally the right-sided people are extremely serious, very serious,

00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:26.250
even if you tickle them they won't laugh.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.125
But Buddha is laughing all the time

00:17:29.333 --> 00:17:32.041
with His both His hands like this, enjoying Himself.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.333
See the contrast.

00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:44.083
So when you are working without any desire, only then,

00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:50.166
this state can be achieved that you'll be all the time laughing.

00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:59.208
But those who feel that we are doing this work" with certain desire.

00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:04.458
I mean, some are very low-level people, want to make money,

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:07.208
some, this, that, nonsense that goes on,

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:12.250
but it becomes even subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:16.667
As you become subtler, the desires start becoming subtler

00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:19.333
and subtler and subtler.

00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:27.125
And if you are not careful, it just comes up.

00:18:30.583 --> 00:18:34.166
So He's the one who is on the right side placed,

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:39.542
going to the left side. He's the one who has said that

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.083
"You have to be desireless," on the right side.

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:50.125
What a contrast.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.291
Specially in the West, I've seen people do little bit "Huh."

00:18:58.041 --> 00:19:02.041
What have they done? "I lifted that spoon."

00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:05.250
And with the spoon they sit down.

00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:10.208
And they are surprised to see Me that I'm not tired.

00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:15.041
But I don't do anything. I mean, I have no desires.

00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:17.250
Actually I never do anything;

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:20.333
I'm just Nishkriya, I'm just doing nothing.

00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:28.041
So, when you become that instrument, surrendered instrument,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.083
when you know you are not doing anything whatsoever,

00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:40.250
then on the right side you achieve mastery.

00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:45.083
How you achieve mastery?

00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:49.333
You don't do anything, all right?

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:57.417
You go to any shop and you get a jackpot, without doing anything.

00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:05.041
You do not desire anything and suddenly you find,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.125
which you have never ever thought of is before you,

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:12.333
there, sits there, available for you, just have it.

00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:25.041
So, with the desire to achieve something,

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:30.041
when you work out, it also has a reaction.

00:20:32.208 --> 00:20:35.333
Every action has a reaction.

00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:39.417
But action without desire cannot have reaction

00:20:40.083 --> 00:20:43.291
because there's no desire already, supposing, supposing.

00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:52.166
I get lost somewhere on the way.

00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:59.166
So I never feel upset about it because, maybe I have to be there.

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:10.333
Supposing I want to, sort of, I have to buy some,

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:15.041
say like a castle, take it like that.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:19.291
So people getâ€¦I have to buy you see, that's different than desiring.

00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:22.166
I mean, it also came in My neck suddenly,

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:25.333
I just said that "I have to live in Italy, so must buy a house,"

00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:29.166
they showed Me a castle, and this turned out to be no good.

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.041
All right, doesn't matter.

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:34.000
Then the second one, everybody got attached.

00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:37.166
"You must buy this, at any cost,." this thing.

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:40.166
I somehow didn't like the place very much,

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:43.083
but I said,  "All right, let their desire be fulfilled."

00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:48.041
It so happened that they were all uprooted

00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:51.542
and they had to buy another one, which they didn't want to buy.

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:56.041
And I was very happy about it because I didn't desire anything,

00:21:56.417 --> 00:21:59.041
and it turned out to be the best.

00:21:59.208 --> 00:22:03.458
The reason is, whatever is best happens to Me.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:11.375
So whatever happens to Me, I know is the best,

00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:19.041
is all for My good, is for the good of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:21.166 --> 00:22:26.041
Now anybody criticizes Sahaja Yoga, it's very, very good, excellent.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.166
Like in India, first of all, there was one magazine

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:35.458
where Rajneesh used someone to speak against Me.

00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:38.500
But that lady had stolen some of My photographs

00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:41.083
and had given the photographs as well,

00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:44.333
and everybody in My family was so angry,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.041
My brothers, My husband, they wanted to sue the paper.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:52.333
I said, I don't like this idea of suing the paper or anything."

00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:58.041
So, when we had the first program in Delhi,

00:22:58.208 --> 00:23:04.333
it was so overcrowded that I could not even take My car inside.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.041
So I had to â€¦ I mean, the outside also was filled,

00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:13.041
and they had to put loudspeakers outside the hall.

00:23:14.542 --> 00:23:18.208
And I asked the people how is it they are here?

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:21.208
They said, "We saw your photographs in the Illustrated Weekly

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.333
and we were so much impressed."

00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:26.041
They never read anything,

00:23:28.125 --> 00:23:30.625
not a word, and they were all there.

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:34.083
One of them is Harsh and so many of them have come from there,

00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:37.083
just seeing the photograph.

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:41.458
So if she had stolen the photograph it was for our good,

00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:47.125
and it â€¦ I mean, normally we would have paid lot of money

00:23:47.291 --> 00:23:51.041
to publish something without paying any money it was there.

00:23:52.291 --> 00:23:56.458
And then these people, you see, My family people,

00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:01.083
they saw that this magazine was closed for six months

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.166
and they had to go into a terrible loss.

00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:10.041
I didn't desire that either.

00:24:14.041 --> 00:24:17.166
When you're desireless you are happy

00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:23.333
because you are never disappointed, you are never nervous.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.041
So to be desireless

00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:34.709
doesn't mean that you become something absurd

00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:38.125
or ascetic or anything like that,

00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:45.500
but not to expect something.

00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:51.291
"If I do like this then this will happen.

00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:53.709
If I do like this that willâ€¦" Not to worry,

00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:56.083
do what you want to do.

00:24:56.542 --> 00:25:02.041
One thing you should know that nothing bad can happen to you,

00:25:03.041 --> 00:25:07.458
and if something bad is happening, that something wrong with you.

00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:12.458
I'll tell you another thing.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.333
This time, first time, I fell down a little bit,

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.458
little bit, not much.

00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:22.125
So they said, "You can't go out of the house at all.

00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:24.583
You cannot move out because it's raining

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.250
and you'll develop arthritis."

00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:28.625
I can never develop anything like that, but doesn't matter.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.041
So I was made to stay in the house and I wrote this book in that.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.542
It was nice I fell down.

00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:38.250
Otherwise they would have said, "Come here, come."

00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:41.041
All My family was there for a holiday.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.500
Thank God. I got these four-five days, I wrote this book.

00:25:47.333 --> 00:25:51.500
So make the best of all disappointments.

00:25:55.166 --> 00:25:58.083
If there is a disappointment, just smile at it

00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:02.375
and know for â€¦ it is for your good, to discover something new,

00:26:02.583 --> 00:26:05.417
to find out something better.

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:10.375
But the conditioning is so strong.

00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:14.041
That's why I say, "Be in the collective."

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:18.166
Now for example, we have Indians, we have got French,

00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:19.583
we have this, that and all that.

00:26:19.709 --> 00:26:23.041
All their conditions are around them, still.

00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:27.041
For Indians, must have Indian food wherever they go.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.083
It's a very difficult situation.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.125
That way you people are better, you eat every sort of â€¦

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:35.333
even you eat wretched Indian food.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.250
I don't like very much Indian food Myself; it's not very nourishing.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.166
It's more tasty but not nourishing.

00:26:44.208 --> 00:26:47.041
But you don't mind eating any food whatsoever,

00:26:47.542 --> 00:26:51.458
that's a good thing about you, but your desires are another,

00:26:52.041 --> 00:26:56.417
little different, which you know very well, I need not tell you.

00:26:58.041 --> 00:27:00.709
Like, I told ladies not to carry too many cosmetics

00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:03.125
and heavy things with them,

00:27:03.333 --> 00:27:06.333
but whenever they come the men break their hands

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.166
picking up their big, big suitcases.

00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:18.417
Now, I'm not saying that should walk about

00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:25.250
in a manner that is not so decent, but

00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:28.333
for that, keep to minimum.

00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:38.000
Or else, there is a competition with a leader,

00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:41.250
always, somebody will be there.

00:27:44.083 --> 00:27:48.250
But in the West what I find, not so much for food but for house,

00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:53.625
even in India, if you marry an Indian wife she'll try or a Greek,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.166
Greek wife also will try to keep the husband to herself,

00:27:57.333 --> 00:27:59.375
is a common thing, I've seen it.

00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:02.417
They're something like Indians

00:28:03.208 --> 00:28:06.458
and they'll spoil the ascent of the husband and theirs also.

00:28:07.041 --> 00:28:11.208
Is a fact. And very dominating.

00:28:11.542 --> 00:28:13.375
Indian women won't be dominating

00:28:13.542 --> 00:28:16.041
but they will try to control the husband,

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.166
to have another house of their own.

00:28:18.583 --> 00:28:20.709
But they don't knowâ€¦Indians don't know collectivity,

00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:23.125
they are very individualistic.

00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:27.333
Now with Sahaja Yoga, of course,

00:28:27.458 --> 00:28:33.250
they are learning gradually how to be one with others.

00:28:34.208 --> 00:28:38.041
Moreover, culturally some people are different

00:28:38.458 --> 00:28:40.375
so they stick onto their own culture.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.208
Of course, whatever is good in any culture should be taken,

00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:47.291
because whatever is universal culture is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:53.417
But so many things there are where we just falter

00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:56.417
because of our conditionings.

00:28:57.083 --> 00:28:59.166
And that's why, at the same time,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.083
we had another great incarnation of Mahavira,

00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:08.333
who's pointed out what are the punishments for people

00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:12.083
who indulge into their conditionings.

00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:17.041
I mean, horrible things He has talked about.

00:29:18.333 --> 00:29:22.041
What will happen to people if they have their conditioning,

00:29:22.458 --> 00:29:26.458
where will they end up, what will be their situation,

00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:30.542
what kind of hell they will get, this has been described.

00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:36.125
Horrible things. Of course I'm not going to tell about that today.

00:29:37.417 --> 00:29:41.375
But common thing about Him and all His contemporary:

00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:45.250
like Buddha, Kabira and all these people,

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:48.333
was one thing common which came that they

00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:53.083
not Kabira so much as Buddha

00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:56.417
that it's better not to even talk about God

00:29:56.542 --> 00:30:03.208
but to talk about abstract, about formless.

00:30:06.083 --> 00:30:10.458
Because the worst condition in those days was

00:30:11.208 --> 00:30:17.208
that once they started worshipping any deity or anything,

00:30:19.041 --> 00:30:22.333
they became complete slaves of that.

00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:26.458
Like Mohammed Sahib also said â€¦ He talked of nirakar.

00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:31.000
But these two went even beyond that and they talked,

00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:33.333
There's no God, better not talk of God just now,

00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:36.333
better get your Self-realization." I did the same in the beginning.

00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:40.041
I said, "Get your Self-realization."

00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:46.208
Because anybody can start, "I am God."

00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:52.375
So they never talked about God, not at all,

00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:58.208
and they all the time said that "There is no God

00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:00.333
but it is your Self."

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:04.041
They tabooed actually they're called as Nirishwaras,

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:08.458
Nirishwarwad did not believe - both of them did not believe in God,

00:31:08.542 --> 00:31:11.166
but in Self-realization.

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:22.333
They knew that I had to come and tell you about it.

00:31:23.125 --> 00:31:29.041
So Buddha has talked about the future Buddha, which is Maitreya.

00:31:30.458 --> 00:31:35.041
Ma is Mother, who is in three forms:

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.458
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:31:39.291 --> 00:31:42.333
Any Buddhist, if you ask him to ask the question of Maitreya,

00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:45.458
he gets his realization just then.

00:31:48.166 --> 00:31:51.500
So He talked of Maitreya because He knew

00:31:52.041 --> 00:31:53.500
that when Maitreya will come,

00:31:54.083 --> 00:31:58.041
She will have to tell people about Ishwara.

00:31:58.166 --> 00:32:01.542
According to them, the people had not that â€¦ reached that stage

00:32:02.041 --> 00:32:05.500
that you could tell them about Ishwara.

00:32:06.083 --> 00:32:09.417
So they said there is no God

00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:19.041
just to accentuate Self-realization, Atmagyan,

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:24.333
knowledge about your self, Self-realization.

00:32:25.417 --> 00:32:30.000
And early Buddhists, I'm told â€¦

00:32:31.083 --> 00:32:34.375
of course they were bhikshukas, they were ascetics,

00:32:34.542 --> 00:32:37.041
but they had the experience

00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:40.333
of the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

00:32:42.041 --> 00:32:47.333
just like the Gnostics I think, but they were very few.

00:32:48.208 --> 00:32:52.041
They were not as many as you are,

00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:55.333
but quality-wise they were very high

00:32:56.041 --> 00:33:02.291
because all of them had come through that terrible penances.

00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:07.542
So quality-wise they were very high

00:33:08.208 --> 00:33:11.125
and because the difference between them and others,

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.333
the quality-wise, was so much

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.375
that they could not impress the others and so

00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:21.291
just it died out, I should say.

00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:24.166
But still we had Zen, where Vidditama,

00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:28.542
is another disciple of Christ went downâ€¦ of Buddha, went down

00:33:29.375 --> 00:33:34.083
and Tao. These two are the ones

00:33:34.542 --> 00:33:42.041
which are expressing Buddha's ideals about Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:45.458
Tao is nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:49.041
Tao means how, how it works out,

00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:53.041
and Zen system, Zen means dhyana.

00:33:53.458 --> 00:33:57.542
So they also believed in raising the kundalini.

00:33:59.041 --> 00:34:04.542
They did not hit, at that time, anybody's spinal chord,

00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:08.041
but later on they started hitting people's spinal chord

00:34:08.166 --> 00:34:13.083
with some stick to put them into dhyana.

00:34:15.166 --> 00:34:22.542
So Tao and Zen both are offshoots of the same Buddhism,

00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:27.041
in the real sense of the word I should say,

00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:36.083
of their ascent without talking about Ishwara, about God,

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:43.458
but aims were the same, to become Buddha,

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.375
but they also died out.

00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:53.041
I met the head of the Zen who came to Me for curing.

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:56.041
I asked him, I said,

00:34:56.417 --> 00:34:59.542
"How is it you are the leader, you are not even a kashayapa?"

00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:02.542
Kashayapa is the one who is a realized soul.

00:35:03.083 --> 00:35:05.083
So He told Me, confessed to Me they had only

00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:07.542
twenty-six Kashayapas throughout

00:35:08.083 --> 00:35:13.000
and only after the sixth century it started,

00:35:13.125 --> 00:35:18.041
and very few were there and it has died out.

00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:24.208
That means how lucky you are that you are all realized souls.

00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:30.000
So for our banyan tree is the collectivity.

00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:36.542
We have to make ourselves subtler beings,

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:40.333
to be one with the collective,

00:35:42.291 --> 00:35:49.417
and that is very enjoyable, very beautiful.

00:35:51.208 --> 00:35:53.458
Those who cannot do it,

00:35:54.458 --> 00:35:57.333
cannot progress in Sahaja Yoga, they are problematic

00:35:57.458 --> 00:36:01.291
and they create problems and they trouble everyone.

00:36:01.542 --> 00:36:08.041
Their attention is bad and no one knows how they stand.

00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:20.333
So Buddha's message is, of course, is not to develop ego.

00:36:21.208 --> 00:36:24.083
But how do you do that?

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.083
First of all, whatever you are doing

00:36:27.208 --> 00:36:29.542
you have to say, "I am not doing it.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.542
It's Mother who is doing it"

00:36:36.458 --> 00:36:42.458
or God who is doing it, I am not doing anything."

00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:53.166
But if you feel that you are doing something for Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:56.417
it's better you stop doing it.

00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:01.166
But you should say, "No, it came my way.

00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:05.166
I just â€¦ I didn't do anything. I was just there. That's all."

00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:10.375
Then you have achieved a great deal.

00:37:15.291 --> 00:37:19.542
And the second thing is of desire,

00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:26.500
even desire of anything,

00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:31.542
of smallest thing or the biggest thing or

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:35.166
even loving your children, loving you wife,

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:38.458
this "my, mine" all those things;

00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:48.041
all these desires, if they are not fulfilled you feel frustrated,

00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:52.333
then you must know that there's something wrong with you.

00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:05.250
But, if you understand the sense of collectivity,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.542
then you can ascend very fast.

00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:16.458
I would say Indians are extremely religious,

00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:19.500
disciplined people, in a way,

00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:22.291
but they are lacking in collectivity.

00:38:22.417 --> 00:38:27.083
If they can come up to collectivity, they can shoot off.

00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:33.083
The only nation which I have found very good, is Russia.

00:38:33.542 --> 00:38:41.250
Because of Communism they are collective and desireless,

00:38:43.542 --> 00:38:48.125
because all their desires were fulfilled by Communistic ideas,

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:54.041
they didn't have any choices left, and also they were collective.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:59.041
In a way Communism has suited the public not the government.

00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:02.166
While the other way round democracy has suited the government

00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:06.166
to make money but the public has suffered.

00:39:10.417 --> 00:39:13.458
So we are people

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.041
who have not been able to know about collectivity.

00:39:21.542 --> 00:39:24.000
So I would say

00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:29.291
the collectivity develops faster in the West no doubt, much faster,

00:39:32.208 --> 00:39:38.041
but desireless, desirelessness is less.

00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:40.375
So it's like somebody has the teeth

00:39:40.458 --> 00:39:44.166
and somebody has the food, sort of a thing.

00:39:46.125 --> 00:39:50.083
If we can see ourselves as we are

00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:55.417
and try to understand

00:39:56.125 --> 00:39:59.208
that either we have this problem or that problem.

00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:03.542
If you could just somehow or other neutralize

00:40:04.166 --> 00:40:09.333
this one-sided problem, you could be there, because if you solve one

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.333
you can go to another, from there to there.

00:40:12.458 --> 00:40:16.458
But just to stand in the center and see for yourself,

00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:21.375
"What are my desires?" Count them one by one.

00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:24.458
I mean if I have to think, "What is My desire,"

00:40:24.542 --> 00:40:28.083
I become thoughtless, really, My position is horrible.

00:40:29.041 --> 00:40:34.250
If I have to think "What should I desire now," I become thoughtless.

00:40:37.041 --> 00:40:39.458
I was â€¦ sometimes I said, I will develop some ego."

00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:42.417
I don't know from where to start.

00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:48.291
Must have some ego, after all everybody has, so why not Me?

00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:54.458
I don't know how to start it.

00:40:57.208 --> 00:41:03.500
Then, we also have these conditionings

00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:06.125
of developing this horrible thing called guilt.

00:41:06.291 --> 00:41:09.041
I mean this I, it's another â€¦ at the time of Buddha

00:41:09.208 --> 00:41:11.375
nobody had this problem, I think.

00:41:11.709 --> 00:41:18.041
This is a modern technique, to feel guilty;

00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:21.333
some sort of a modernism in it

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.458
because I don't know how it is worked out.

00:41:25.166 --> 00:41:31.166
And this modernism of this horrible thing called guilty"

00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:37.333
is something really has come to My lot to clear out,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.083
not at the time of Buddha, He never had this.

00:41:41.542 --> 00:41:45.041
Otherwise He would have paved way for Me, but that He did not.

00:41:45.166 --> 00:41:47.709
He has left it to Me to clear out your

00:41:48.125 --> 00:41:53.000
Left Vishuddhis and Mine also all the time hurting Me here.

00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:02.041
So this horrible thing specially Western mind,

00:42:02.166 --> 00:42:09.083
Indians don't have guilt, nothing but this has to be overcome.

00:42:12.458 --> 00:42:16.542
As you know that Buddha and Mahavira

00:42:17.083 --> 00:42:21.041
both support the center of Agnya.

00:42:22.542 --> 00:42:28.375
So if you have to have a very clear-cut Agnya chakra

00:42:29.166 --> 00:42:34.458
then on one side you should be desireless,

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:39.500
you should forgive, kshum."

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:43.542
Kshum is the bija mantra, is to forgive;

00:42:44.166 --> 00:42:48.417
bija mantra of right side.

00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:51.083
Kshum, I forgive.

00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.500
And the left side is hum."

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.041
Like the left sided person always feels, "Oh, I'm no good."

00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:06.041
This he has to say, "No, I'm good."

00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:08.500
Hum," I am."

00:43:11.041 --> 00:43:14.041
So hum and kshum: these are two bija mantras,

00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:17.041
which we have to say. Of course, if you say they will act

00:43:17.166 --> 00:43:21.041
because, after all, now your pranas have become pranavas,

00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:24.542
your breath has become enlightened,

00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:29.375
but rather weak I should say, but doesn't matter.

00:43:30.166 --> 00:43:33.458
Your mantras can act.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:41.041
You must use these two bija mantras to clear out your Agnyas.

00:43:42.166 --> 00:43:45.125
But Mahavira has a solution for this

00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:47.500
that after realization if you catch your Agnya,

00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:50.083
you get a terrible headache.

00:43:50.458 --> 00:43:52.250
That's Mahavira's style.

00:43:53.041 --> 00:43:57.458
You do anything wrong, you get punishment;

00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:06.041
you indulge into anything, you are punished;

00:44:06.333 --> 00:44:09.166
you go against Sahaja Yoga, you are punished.

00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:14.375
I'm not doing anything, it's Mahavira, simultaneously working.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:22.417
If you try to be overly smart, you are outsmarted.

00:44:25.458 --> 00:44:31.333
So these two forces are working from the right, left, left to right.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:38.083
If you overdo right, then the left hits you hard.

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:43.041
If you overdo left, then the right hits you hard.

00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:46.125
Both of them are like, really like,

00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:51.458
double-pronged attacks.

00:44:52.417 --> 00:44:55.291
One is, says, Don't have desire."

00:44:55.458 --> 00:45:01.083
All right, you have desire punished, this side.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.041
Like, some people say, "I must have children, I must have children."

00:45:06.542 --> 00:45:08.375
You give them the children, they say,

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.125
"Mother, why this horrible child you have given me;

00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:14.291
he's such a horrible thing."

00:45:18.041 --> 00:45:19.458
Then somebody says, "Mother,

00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:25.250
give me a lady from, say, Maharashtra."

00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:29.542
Recently there was a case like that. She was bothering too much,

00:45:30.125 --> 00:45:32.458
"Mother, give me one lady from Maharashtra."

00:45:33.041 --> 00:45:37.041
And a real special style came to punish.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:40.000
They said, "No more from Maharashtra,"

00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:44.542
and she was reallyâ€¦ I've never heard of such a woman in Maharashtra.

00:45:45.417 --> 00:45:46.542
Horrible.

00:45:49.041 --> 00:45:52.000
Because she was insisting on it, so she had it,

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:55.041
and she says, "No more from Maharashtra; baarpre baap."

00:45:55.166 --> 00:45:57.417
"No, no," I said, "everybody is excellent.

00:45:57.542 --> 00:46:02.375
This was an exceptional case, came just to punish you."

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.625
So, to have any desires â€¦ if you cross a certain limit

00:46:09.041 --> 00:46:12.041
you are punished, and that is done by Mahavira.

00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:15.667
In a small way or a big way.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:24.208
Like, there was a little boy who came to London, very bombastic,

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:29.166
and he wanted to buy something for himself.

00:46:29.375 --> 00:46:33.125
I took him to an ordinary shop and there was a very nice coat,

00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:35.417
full wool and all that. He wouldn't buy.

00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:38.166
"I want to go to a big shop." I said, "All right."

00:46:38.333 --> 00:46:42.041
So, I said, "I'm not coming." I sent His father.

00:46:42.375 --> 00:46:46.709
And he came back with an artificial

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:53.041
coat from that shop without knowing that it was  artificial

00:46:53.625 --> 00:46:56.625
because he wouldn't take something from an ordinary shop.

00:46:57.083 --> 00:46:59.625
So in the big shop, very nicely, big price they gave

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:03.041
and this they got.

00:47:04.041 --> 00:47:10.542
Every minute Sahaja yogis must know that there is a

00:47:14.542 --> 00:47:18.125
Mahavira sitting round.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:25.166
Also, Buddha is there who gives you

00:47:27.125 --> 00:47:33.375
an indication that "Don't do this.

00:47:33.583 --> 00:47:35.583
Do not desire so much."

00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:40.250
He puts limitations to you; but if you don't listen, then all right,

00:47:40.417 --> 00:47:42.041
Mahavira is there to correct you.

00:47:42.208 --> 00:47:46.709
Up to a point He goes, then you get headaches,

00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:51.041
then you say, "Mother, why did I get headaches?"

00:47:53.041 --> 00:47:56.041
You asked for it.

00:47:56.417 --> 00:47:59.041
It's such an automatic machinery

00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:05.041
that we have to be very careful as Sahaja yogis.

00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:11.250
So, today's understanding should be that

00:48:11.458 --> 00:48:17.041
we all should become collective from inside.

00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:22.041
We should not grudge or grumble about everything

00:48:23.041 --> 00:48:25.041
and enjoy the collectivity.

00:48:25.583 --> 00:48:29.667
But the second side of collectivity is this,

00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:33.500
that, do not try to exploit the collectivity

00:48:33.667 --> 00:48:36.041
otherwise you'll be in trouble.

00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:40.000
Like, I've seen some people don't know how to use their bathrooms.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:44.083
When you are collective you have to be

00:48:45.125 --> 00:48:49.333
respecting the collectivity of others.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:57.417
By your presence another person should not, by any chance, suffer,

00:48:58.291 --> 00:49:02.250
or should not feel in any way

00:49:04.125 --> 00:49:09.709
insulted or inconvenienced.

00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:15.709
So when you are in the collective it should be such that

00:49:16.125 --> 00:49:19.041
another person should enjoy your company,

00:49:19.542 --> 00:49:23.041
enjoy your being there.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:29.417
That is something where there is no problem.

00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:38.166
But if you are demanding and if you are asking for things and

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:40.291
you think no end of yourself,

00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:42.500
you can not at all collective, by any chance,

00:49:42.625 --> 00:49:44.417
but you'll suffer for that,

00:49:47.709 --> 00:49:51.041
automatically you will suffer.

00:49:52.458 --> 00:49:59.458
If this is realized and understood properly, your Agnya is solved.

00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:06.625
Like anger.

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:16.458
There are people always boast, "I'm very angry with him." Boast.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.333
But just make that anger into forgiveness

00:50:24.125 --> 00:50:27.709
and you will see the person, instead of you getting into

00:50:28.166 --> 00:50:31.041
problems, he will get into problems.

00:50:32.041 --> 00:50:39.125
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will upset him, automatically.

00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:45.041
It's the biggest weapon you have got is to forgive.

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:51.041
And this is shown in Buddha's character throughout.

00:50:58.709 --> 00:51:04.542
And this will give you self-respect

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:09.083
that you are not disturbed by anything, you see.

00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:13.041
Like a ship has to be seaworthy.

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.458
If you put the ship on the sea and if it breaks,

00:51:15.583 --> 00:51:17.709
what's the use of making a ship?

00:51:18.166 --> 00:51:19.500
What's the use of a Sahaja yogi

00:51:19.667 --> 00:51:23.333
who gets disturbed at every moment?

00:51:24.667 --> 00:51:27.583
You have to be seaworthy, and if you are seaworthy

00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:30.041
nothing can disturb you. All right.

00:51:30.208 --> 00:51:33.291
The elephant is walking and the dogs are barking all right,

00:51:33.458 --> 00:51:35.041
let them bark. What does it matter?

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.500
The elephant looks this side, like that,

00:51:37.667 --> 00:51:40.625
sometimes takes some water and blesses them with water.

00:51:41.083 --> 00:51:45.667
"All right. Quieten down; so that your head will be cooled down."

00:51:48.291 --> 00:51:52.333
That will give you self-esteem

00:51:52.583 --> 00:51:58.041
and you will know what you are much higher than others.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.709
And this is what is â€¦ how to get rid of your ego,

00:52:05.166 --> 00:52:09.083
which is a very, very big problem according to you people.

00:52:10.083 --> 00:52:14.041
"Mother, how to get rid of ego?"

00:52:14.333 --> 00:52:18.709
Ego can be said, "You go."

00:52:21.125 --> 00:52:26.041
When this I-ness goes away, the Self rises.

00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:30.000
What is there to feel hurt? What is there to feel bad?

00:52:30.166 --> 00:52:34.041
What is there to hurt others?

00:52:34.542 --> 00:52:36.625
Han [Hindi meaning 'yes'] all right, you are cheated,

00:52:37.083 --> 00:52:41.041
very good; at least you have not cheated anyone, be happy about it.

00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:48.125
But once you are without ego means you have surrendered yourself,

00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:51.417
no one can cheat you.

00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:59.250
Can you understand that?

00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:08.041
No one can cheat you because there is some

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.583
higher force, which is looking after you.

00:53:16.667 --> 00:53:21.041
This is the way we should understand Buddha.

00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:26.041
This is â€¦ we should know our Buddha qualities.

00:53:26.709 --> 00:53:30.041
This is how our ego can be dissolved.

00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:34.083
When you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

00:53:34.542 --> 00:53:42.333
That just means that you give that horrible ego a complete holiday,

00:53:44.583 --> 00:53:51.083
it means that. That is how this ego disappears.

00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:57.000
I think all your, yourâ€¦ just now,

00:53:57.208 --> 00:54:02.041
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you, somehow.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:06.041
And then you'll laugh at everything;

00:54:06.333 --> 00:54:13.208
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy everything.

00:54:15.542 --> 00:54:17.417
May God bless you.
