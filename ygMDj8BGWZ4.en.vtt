WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.417
August 4th, 1991, Denize, Belgium

00:03.041 --> 00:08.333
Today, we have assembled here

00:09.333 --> 00:14.333
to do puja to Buddha.

00:17.333 --> 00:23.041
As you know Buddha was a son of a king.

00:26.333 --> 00:32.125
And one day He was shocked to see a very poor man,

00:32.291 --> 00:36.041
thin man, walking on the street, very unhappy person,

00:41.208 --> 00:45.125
and He felt very sad about it.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.667
Then He saw one person who was

00:54.125 --> 01:00.041
very sick and about to die.

01:02.125 --> 01:06.250
Then He saw a man

01:09.333 --> 01:13.625
who was dead and people were carrying him

01:14.709 --> 01:17.041
to the cremation ground.

01:18.166 --> 01:21.083
This all upset Him very much

01:22.000 --> 01:25.625
and He started thinking about it

01:26.041 --> 01:28.250
and seeking what is the reason

01:29.041 --> 01:32.041
for all these happenings in human beings.

01:32.208 --> 01:36.166
Firstly, why do they become so

01:41.583 --> 01:46.041
miserable or sick,

01:47.542 --> 01:51.166
or, why do they die so miserably?

01:55.041 --> 01:58.041
The reason He found out in His search.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.709
He went round the whole world, I should say, in the sense:

02:01.166 --> 02:03.291
He read Upanishads, [UNCLEAR]  went to many gurus,

02:03.458 --> 02:10.041
went to many places of spiritual education,

02:11.041 --> 02:13.250
Benares, everywhere He went.

02:13.458 --> 02:18.250
And ultimately, He was sitting under a banyan tree

02:18.709 --> 02:24.500
when suddenly His kundalini was awakened by Adi Shakti

02:25.000 --> 02:27.208
and He got His realization.

02:28.041 --> 02:33.333
Then He realized that the reason for all this is the desire.

02:38.375 --> 02:41.333
In Sahaja Yoga, we have now understood

02:42.125 --> 02:47.333
that all other desires are not pure desires.

02:50.041 --> 02:55.041
Firstly, whatever desires are fulfilled,

02:55.250 --> 02:59.041
we are not satisfied by it, first thing.

02:59.458 --> 03:04.166
And secondly, all these desires have a repercussion.

03:09.583 --> 03:12.250
So what is the pure desire?

03:12.542 --> 03:16.333
That, you all know, is the kundalini.

03:17.291 --> 03:21.208
Kundalini is the power of pure desire,

03:21.417 --> 03:25.458
which fulfils your pure desire to be the spirit,

03:25.625 --> 03:29.208
to be Buddha, to be enlightened.

03:30.458 --> 03:34.041
Buddha means a person who is enlightened.

03:35.041 --> 03:38.208
So Gautama becomeâ€¦ became Buddha,

03:39.125 --> 03:43.041
as you people now have become Sahaja yogis.

03:44.250 --> 03:50.709
But because He went through all these various penances,

03:53.041 --> 03:59.041
whatever He learned became part and parcel of Him,

03:59.583 --> 04:03.041
but in Sahaja Yoga it is all sahaj.

04:03.291 --> 04:09.000
So we always conclude everything that "This is, after all, sahaj."

04:11.041 --> 04:13.291
And when we try to work out anything,

04:13.458 --> 04:16.333
we always say, "Oh, it will work out spontaneously.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.083
It's all right, Mother will do for us everything."

04:23.083 --> 04:27.041
This is a common failing in Sahaja Yoga.

04:28.250 --> 04:33.125
So whether to put you all through that long process

04:34.166 --> 04:38.250
or to give you realization was a question before Me.

04:40.208 --> 04:43.041
Because, in these days of confusion

04:43.417 --> 04:48.041
there cannot be much time to put you through all which

04:48.250 --> 04:53.083
Buddha had gone, and He was one individual, I had to put all of you.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.291
That would have been very difficult.

04:55.458 --> 04:58.291
I don't know how many would have sustained it.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.250
Most of them would have dropped out half way,

05:01.458 --> 05:04.125
or maybe quarter of the way.

05:07.041 --> 05:11.125
So it was done in a sahaj manner.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.166
You did not have to sit in a banyan tree.

05:15.333 --> 05:18.041
Ultimately you got your realization.

05:18.542 --> 05:21.333
Your kundalini was awakened

05:24.041 --> 05:26.041
and you got your enlightenment.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.625
But that enlightenment which settled in Buddha,

05:30.083 --> 05:32.667
is not settled in us because

05:33.125 --> 05:38.083
our chakras were not cleansed as He had cleansed His chakras.

05:38.542 --> 05:44.250
We had the same body, the same mind

05:46.041 --> 05:50.125
and the same attitude when we got realization.

05:52.041 --> 05:55.625
As we were looking at the house of God,

05:56.083 --> 05:58.291
still we are looking at the house of God,

05:58.667 --> 06:01.375
but you have entered inside the house and you have to

06:01.583 --> 06:04.041
look out from the windows.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.208
This you forget.

06:07.542 --> 06:11.333
And though we are sitting now on a hilltop

06:12.125 --> 06:15.291
out of all the congestion and

06:16.625 --> 06:21.041
all the traffic, still you see a car, you get frightened.

06:21.583 --> 06:25.041
You don't know you are sitting on top of a hill

06:25.417 --> 06:28.125
where your Mother has put you nicely.

06:29.333 --> 06:34.083
And that is how you try to behave.

06:35.250 --> 06:38.041
When I get reports about Sahaja yogis,

06:38.250 --> 06:40.166
I am quite amazed that they do not know

06:40.333 --> 06:43.125
that they are realized souls now.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.375
That's why Buddha talked of desirelessness.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.125
It's not possible before realization,

06:52.291 --> 06:56.291
even after realization I find it's difficult.

06:58.166 --> 07:02.041
Some sort of a subtle desire exists

07:02.625 --> 07:09.375
and where you have to work it out, you do not work it out,

07:10.125 --> 07:13.583
saying that "Our ego will be catching."

07:14.041 --> 07:16.583
So wherever it suits us we work that way,

07:17.041 --> 07:20.125
wherever it suits we work this way.

07:25.166 --> 07:28.041
The solution of the whole thing is one

07:28.208 --> 07:31.125
which I have found out Myself, was this:

07:31.375 --> 07:35.000
that it's a collective happening.

07:38.417 --> 07:46.166
A person who is an individual can never get over his ego.

07:47.542 --> 07:51.375
Individualistic person cannot get over his ego.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.208
The one who lives individually,

07:55.041 --> 07:56.625
wants to enjoy everything individually,

07:57.083 --> 08:00.083
can never get over his ego because

08:01.041 --> 08:04.333
you have not gone through all that penances.

08:05.041 --> 08:06.542
Or else, if you are an individual

08:06.709 --> 08:09.375
then you better go through all these penances

08:10.250 --> 08:12.333
and then come back.

08:14.041 --> 08:19.041
So the solution is to wash all our chakras,

08:20.041 --> 08:25.250
cleanse our life in the collective,

08:27.041 --> 08:30.000
and this is what was

08:33.125 --> 08:36.667
the solution of the problem of ego.

08:38.041 --> 08:41.417
Formerly, everybody worked out individually.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.083
Like they had to go to Himalayas, take some guru,

08:46.250 --> 08:47.709
then the guru would throw him out.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.250
Then he would go to another guru,

08:49.417 --> 08:51.166
then work there, then he'll throw it out.

08:51.333 --> 08:55.250
Then next life he'll be born again; again he'll be thrown out.

08:57.125 --> 09:00.250
Ultimately, if one guru accepts, all right, very well.

09:00.417 --> 09:04.083
He's beaten up, he's tortured, he's treated every way,

09:04.291 --> 09:08.250
hanged upside-down. And then ultimately,

09:08.625 --> 09:14.458
if any guru gets nearer to any one individual,

09:14.667 --> 09:18.333
he would give him realization. This was the situation.

09:21.291 --> 09:25.000
But in Sahaja Yoga, the door is open anybody can come in,

09:25.208 --> 09:29.333
anybody. Get your realization.

09:32.041 --> 09:35.333
Because I have faith in collectivity,

09:36.208 --> 09:42.166
this collective life will definitely

09:44.291 --> 09:50.166
give you what Buddha got through His individual efforts.

09:53.542 --> 10:00.125
But there also we fail that we do not know how to be collective.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.709
Individualism is all the time around us.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.417
In every way we think of individuals.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.333
Wherever collectivity has worked, Sahaja Yoga has prospered;

10:15.291 --> 10:20.125
and wherever it has not worked, there has been a problem.

10:23.041 --> 10:29.041
So it is very important that we should look at ourselves,

10:30.041 --> 10:35.041
and see for ourselves and see how much collective we are.

10:35.458 --> 10:38.667
Do you enjoy collectivity, or not?

10:39.458 --> 10:44.041
Are you aiming at collectivity, or not?

10:46.250 --> 10:51.333
As soon as I thought of this Cabella

10:53.041 --> 10:56.041
place you have seen, and I thought I'll make

10:56.291 --> 10:59.041
a little ashram there, near the river, for you.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.625
Immediately people said, "Mother is it all right

11:02.041 --> 11:07.083
if we buy our own houses here?" Immediately.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.375
Then what is the purpose?

11:16.333 --> 11:17.709
And then they will call Me,

11:18.125 --> 11:20.041
"Mother please come to my house for dinner.

11:20.250 --> 11:24.583
Please come to my little house for some tea."

11:25.041 --> 11:27.291
I'm not interested.

11:35.417 --> 11:40.166
So in Sahaja Yoga, unless and until you really become collective in

11:40.333 --> 11:43.333
every sense, you cannot ascend and you cannot wash yourself,

11:43.500 --> 11:45.333
you cannot cleanse yourself.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.583
This point He did not say, but in a way He did say

11:52.125 --> 11:56.083
because He has said, "Buddham sharanam gacchami."

11:57.041 --> 12:01.250
First I surrender myself to my Self-realization.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.625
Then He said, "Dhammam sharanam gacchami "

12:06.083 --> 12:11.041
means the dharma in me, I myself surrender to that dharma.

12:13.041 --> 12:16.041
That is spirituality.

12:16.333 --> 12:20.000
And thirdly He said,

12:23.500 --> 12:26.417
"Sangham sharanam gacchami."

12:27.000 --> 12:29.041
Sangha means collectivity,

12:30.375 --> 12:35.166
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

12:36.583 --> 12:42.041
But He did not know how to give en-masse realization at that time.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.333
So He got hold of disciples

12:47.041 --> 12:49.375
who had to shave off their heads,

12:49.542 --> 12:52.250
whether you are a queen or a king;

12:53.166 --> 12:58.333
who had to wear only one cloth, whether you are a man or a woman;

12:59.333 --> 13:01.333
who had to have

13:02.208 --> 13:08.542
only one mat to sleep in a big hall.

13:10.166 --> 13:15.041
No husband and wife, no marriage, nothing.

13:17.250 --> 13:23.083
And they had to beg their food in the village

13:24.041 --> 13:28.333
and feed the guru and also they themselves

13:30.041 --> 13:34.166
had to eat that food, whether it was sufficient or not.

13:40.208 --> 13:43.125
That is not in Sahaja Yoga.

13:44.166 --> 13:49.166
Everything is enjoyable in Sahaja Yoga from the very beginning

13:52.208 --> 13:55.333
and you are supposed to be

13:55.500 --> 13:59.250
absolutely joyous people in Sahaja Yoga.

14:01.542 --> 14:06.041
That is there. But the joy of the collectivity

14:06.250 --> 14:09.208
if you do not know how to enjoy,

14:10.542 --> 14:15.291
then you cannot ascend, because there's no other way out.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.125
What is the other penance?

14:17.333 --> 14:20.333
For some people even collectivity is a penance

14:20.583 --> 14:23.417
till they start enjoying it.

14:26.291 --> 14:30.041
And they are very troublesome; "This is not good," very critical.

14:30.208 --> 14:31.667
Some of them stay in the ashram

14:32.041 --> 14:33.375
and criticize everything all the time.

14:33.542 --> 14:38.125
"This is not good. I don't like this, I don't like that."

14:41.166 --> 14:44.166
So here, in complete awareness,

14:44.333 --> 14:45.667
I mean you cannot be mesmerized.

14:46.041 --> 14:49.333
If you are mesmerized then you can live whatever way you like.

14:50.041 --> 14:53.375
But in complete awareness and full understanding

14:54.083 --> 14:57.166
we have to become collective.

14:58.125 --> 15:06.125
This is one of the solutions for our cleansing.

15:09.041 --> 15:16.250
We can say like this: supposing My hands are dirty,

15:18.333 --> 15:23.166
so I go to one tap and I find there is one drop coming,

15:24.041 --> 15:25.500
so I can't wash.

15:26.041 --> 15:30.166
So I go to another place, there's no water.

15:31.125 --> 15:37.333
Third place I find there's nothing available.

15:39.041 --> 15:42.125
Ultimately, I reach the place where I find some water.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.041
Then I wash Myself completely,

15:45.208 --> 15:48.417
because I know I can't find it anywhere else.

15:50.166 --> 15:56.250
But in Sahaja Yoga, you are immersed

15:58.291 --> 16:02.083
in the water of collectivity.

16:04.417 --> 16:10.041
If you enjoy this collectivity and can swim in that,

16:10.542 --> 16:13.208
then there's no problem.

16:19.333 --> 16:25.083
Buddha, as you know, is working on our right side, on our Agnya.

16:26.041 --> 16:29.333
Is very surprising, the Deity like Him,

16:32.083 --> 16:34.041
to work on the right side.

16:34.291 --> 16:38.375
First He said, for the right side, you should be detached,

16:40.041 --> 16:42.208
desireless.

16:43.083 --> 16:46.041
I mean, nobody would work if they have no desire

16:46.458 --> 16:52.250
and if they have no way of earning something out of it,

16:53.041 --> 16:56.041
I mean, in the normal sense.

16:58.041 --> 17:02.125
But desirelessly you have to work.

17:04.041 --> 17:11.125
Then only the right side can be conquered very symbolic.

17:12.250 --> 17:15.417
Normally the right-sided people are extremely thin,

17:15.625 --> 17:18.041
but Buddha is very fat.

17:19.041 --> 17:23.125
Normally the right-sided people are extremely serious, very serious,

17:23.291 --> 17:26.250
even if you tickle them they won't laugh.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.125
But Buddha is laughing all the time

17:29.333 --> 17:32.041
with His both His hands like this, enjoying Himself.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.333
See the contrast.

17:37.041 --> 17:44.083
So when you are working without any desire, only then,

17:45.041 --> 17:50.166
this state can be achieved that you'll be all the time laughing.

17:52.291 --> 17:59.208
But those who feel that we are doing this work" with certain desire.

18:01.041 --> 18:04.458
I mean, some are very low-level people, want to make money,

18:04.667 --> 18:07.208
some, this, that, nonsense that goes on,

18:08.125 --> 18:12.250
but it becomes even subtler and subtler and subtler.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.667
As you become subtler, the desires start becoming subtler

18:17.083 --> 18:19.333
and subtler and subtler.

18:22.166 --> 18:27.125
And if you are not careful, it just comes up.

18:30.583 --> 18:34.166
So He's the one who is on the right side placed,

18:34.333 --> 18:39.542
going to the left side. He's the one who has said that

18:40.000 --> 18:46.083
"You have to be desireless," on the right side.

18:47.208 --> 18:50.125
What a contrast.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.291
Specially in the West, I've seen people do little bit "Huh."

18:58.041 --> 19:02.041
What have they done? "I lifted that spoon."

19:02.542 --> 19:05.250
And with the spoon they sit down.

19:07.041 --> 19:10.208
And they are surprised to see Me that I'm not tired.

19:10.417 --> 19:15.041
But I don't do anything. I mean, I have no desires.

19:16.041 --> 19:17.250
Actually I never do anything;

19:17.417 --> 19:20.333
I'm just Nishkriya, I'm just doing nothing.

19:24.041 --> 19:28.041
So, when you become that instrument, surrendered instrument,

19:28.250 --> 19:33.083
when you know you are not doing anything whatsoever,

19:34.041 --> 19:40.250
then on the right side you achieve mastery.

19:42.041 --> 19:45.083
How you achieve mastery?

19:46.041 --> 19:49.333
You don't do anything, all right?

19:51.291 --> 19:57.417
You go to any shop and you get a jackpot, without doing anything.

20:00.041 --> 20:05.041
You do not desire anything and suddenly you find,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.125
which you have never ever thought of is before you,

20:08.208 --> 20:12.333
there, sits there, available for you, just have it.

20:17.041 --> 20:25.041
So, with the desire to achieve something,

20:25.125 --> 20:30.041
when you work out, it also has a reaction.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.333
Every action has a reaction.

20:36.041 --> 20:39.417
But action without desire cannot have reaction

20:40.083 --> 20:43.291
because there's no desire already, supposing, supposing.

20:46.041 --> 20:52.166
I get lost somewhere on the way.

20:54.041 --> 20:59.166
So I never feel upset about it because, maybe I have to be there.

21:03.208 --> 21:10.333
Supposing I want to, sort of, I have to buy some,

21:11.041 --> 21:15.041
say like a castle, take it like that.

21:15.250 --> 21:19.291
So people getâ€¦I have to buy you see, that's different than desiring.

21:20.041 --> 21:22.166
I mean, it also came in My neck suddenly,

21:22.333 --> 21:25.333
I just said that "I have to live in Italy, so must buy a house,"

21:26.041 --> 21:29.166
they showed Me a castle, and this turned out to be no good.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.041
All right, doesn't matter.

21:31.208 --> 21:34.000
Then the second one, everybody got attached.

21:34.125 --> 21:37.166
"You must buy this, at any cost,." this thing.

21:38.125 --> 21:40.166
I somehow didn't like the place very much,

21:40.333 --> 21:43.083
but I said,  "All right, let their desire be fulfilled."

21:44.041 --> 21:48.041
It so happened that they were all uprooted

21:48.166 --> 21:51.542
and they had to buy another one, which they didn't want to buy.

21:52.125 --> 21:56.041
And I was very happy about it because I didn't desire anything,

21:56.417 --> 21:59.041
and it turned out to be the best.

21:59.208 --> 22:03.458
The reason is, whatever is best happens to Me.

22:07.333 --> 22:11.375
So whatever happens to Me, I know is the best,

22:12.542 --> 22:19.041
is all for My good, is for the good of Sahaja Yoga.

22:21.166 --> 22:26.041
Now anybody criticizes Sahaja Yoga, it's very, very good, excellent.

22:26.500 --> 22:31.166
Like in India, first of all, there was one magazine

22:31.333 --> 22:35.458
where Rajneesh used someone to speak against Me.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.500
But that lady had stolen some of My photographs

22:39.041 --> 22:41.083
and had given the photographs as well,

22:42.041 --> 22:44.333
and everybody in My family was so angry,

22:44.500 --> 22:48.041
My brothers, My husband, they wanted to sue the paper.

22:48.250 --> 22:52.333
I said, I don't like this idea of suing the paper or anything."

22:55.041 --> 22:58.041
So, when we had the first program in Delhi,

22:58.208 --> 23:04.333
it was so overcrowded that I could not even take My car inside.

23:04.500 --> 23:08.041
So I had to â€¦ I mean, the outside also was filled,

23:08.291 --> 23:13.041
and they had to put loudspeakers outside the hall.

23:14.542 --> 23:18.208
And I asked the people how is it they are here?

23:18.375 --> 23:21.208
They said, "We saw your photographs in the Illustrated Weekly

23:21.333 --> 23:23.333
and we were so much impressed."

23:23.458 --> 23:26.041
They never read anything,

23:28.125 --> 23:30.625
not a word, and they were all there.

23:31.041 --> 23:34.083
One of them is Harsh and so many of them have come from there,

23:35.041 --> 23:37.083
just seeing the photograph.

23:37.542 --> 23:41.458
So if she had stolen the photograph it was for our good,

23:44.125 --> 23:47.125
and it â€¦ I mean, normally we would have paid lot of money

23:47.291 --> 23:51.041
to publish something without paying any money it was there.

23:52.291 --> 23:56.458
And then these people, you see, My family people,

23:57.291 --> 24:01.083
they saw that this magazine was closed for six months

24:01.250 --> 24:05.166
and they had to go into a terrible loss.

24:06.291 --> 24:10.041
I didn't desire that either.

24:14.041 --> 24:17.166
When you're desireless you are happy

24:17.333 --> 24:23.333
because you are never disappointed, you are never nervous.

24:26.500 --> 24:30.041
So to be desireless

24:31.583 --> 24:34.709
doesn't mean that you become something absurd

24:35.125 --> 24:38.125
or ascetic or anything like that,

24:41.083 --> 24:45.500
but not to expect something.

24:49.041 --> 24:51.291
"If I do like this then this will happen.

24:51.458 --> 24:53.709
If I do like this that willâ€¦" Not to worry,

24:54.125 --> 24:56.083
do what you want to do.

24:56.542 --> 25:02.041
One thing you should know that nothing bad can happen to you,

25:03.041 --> 25:07.458
and if something bad is happening, that something wrong with you.

25:11.041 --> 25:12.458
I'll tell you another thing.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.333
This time, first time, I fell down a little bit,

25:15.500 --> 25:17.458
little bit, not much.

25:18.375 --> 25:22.125
So they said, "You can't go out of the house at all.

25:22.291 --> 25:24.583
You cannot move out because it's raining

25:25.000 --> 25:26.250
and you'll develop arthritis."

25:26.375 --> 25:28.625
I can never develop anything like that, but doesn't matter.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.041
So I was made to stay in the house and I wrote this book in that.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.542
It was nice I fell down.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.250
Otherwise they would have said, "Come here, come."

25:38.458 --> 25:41.041
All My family was there for a holiday.

25:41.250 --> 25:45.500
Thank God. I got these four-five days, I wrote this book.

25:47.333 --> 25:51.500
So make the best of all disappointments.

25:55.166 --> 25:58.083
If there is a disappointment, just smile at it

25:58.583 --> 26:02.375
and know for â€¦ it is for your good, to discover something new,

26:02.583 --> 26:05.417
to find out something better.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.375
But the conditioning is so strong.

26:11.083 --> 26:14.041
That's why I say, "Be in the collective."

26:14.333 --> 26:18.166
Now for example, we have Indians, we have got French,

26:18.333 --> 26:19.583
we have this, that and all that.

26:19.709 --> 26:23.041
All their conditions are around them, still.

26:24.166 --> 26:27.041
For Indians, must have Indian food wherever they go.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.083
It's a very difficult situation.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.125
That way you people are better, you eat every sort of â€¦

26:33.291 --> 26:35.333
even you eat wretched Indian food.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.250
I don't like very much Indian food Myself; it's not very nourishing.

26:39.500 --> 26:43.166
It's more tasty but not nourishing.

26:44.208 --> 26:47.041
But you don't mind eating any food whatsoever,

26:47.542 --> 26:51.458
that's a good thing about you, but your desires are another,

26:52.041 --> 26:56.417
little different, which you know very well, I need not tell you.

26:58.041 --> 27:00.709
Like, I told ladies not to carry too many cosmetics

27:01.125 --> 27:03.125
and heavy things with them,

27:03.333 --> 27:06.333
but whenever they come the men break their hands

27:06.500 --> 27:11.166
picking up their big, big suitcases.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.417
Now, I'm not saying that should walk about

27:18.667 --> 27:25.250
in a manner that is not so decent, but

27:25.542 --> 27:28.333
for that, keep to minimum.

27:32.041 --> 27:38.000
Or else, there is a competition with a leader,

27:38.166 --> 27:41.250
always, somebody will be there.

27:44.083 --> 27:48.250
But in the West what I find, not so much for food but for house,

27:48.417 --> 27:53.625
even in India, if you marry an Indian wife she'll try or a Greek,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.166
Greek wife also will try to keep the husband to herself,

27:57.333 --> 27:59.375
is a common thing, I've seen it.

28:00.041 --> 28:02.417
They're something like Indians

28:03.208 --> 28:06.458
and they'll spoil the ascent of the husband and theirs also.

28:07.041 --> 28:11.208
Is a fact. And very dominating.

28:11.542 --> 28:13.375
Indian women won't be dominating

28:13.542 --> 28:16.041
but they will try to control the husband,

28:16.250 --> 28:18.166
to have another house of their own.

28:18.583 --> 28:20.709
But they don't knowâ€¦Indians don't know collectivity,

28:21.125 --> 28:23.125
they are very individualistic.

28:26.041 --> 28:27.333
Now with Sahaja Yoga, of course,

28:27.458 --> 28:33.250
they are learning gradually how to be one with others.

28:34.208 --> 28:38.041
Moreover, culturally some people are different

28:38.458 --> 28:40.375
so they stick onto their own culture.

28:40.500 --> 28:43.208
Of course, whatever is good in any culture should be taken,

28:43.333 --> 28:47.291
because whatever is universal culture is in Sahaja Yoga.

28:49.291 --> 28:53.417
But so many things there are where we just falter

28:53.542 --> 28:56.417
because of our conditionings.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.166
And that's why, at the same time,

28:59.250 --> 29:03.083
we had another great incarnation of Mahavira,

29:04.041 --> 29:08.333
who's pointed out what are the punishments for people

29:08.458 --> 29:12.083
who indulge into their conditionings.

29:13.041 --> 29:17.041
I mean, horrible things He has talked about.

29:18.333 --> 29:22.041
What will happen to people if they have their conditioning,

29:22.458 --> 29:26.458
where will they end up, what will be their situation,

29:27.041 --> 29:30.542
what kind of hell they will get, this has been described.

29:31.083 --> 29:36.125
Horrible things. Of course I'm not going to tell about that today.

29:37.417 --> 29:41.375
But common thing about Him and all His contemporary:

29:42.375 --> 29:45.250
like Buddha, Kabira and all these people,

29:45.333 --> 29:48.333
was one thing common which came that they

29:49.125 --> 29:53.083
not Kabira so much as Buddha

29:53.542 --> 29:56.417
that it's better not to even talk about God

29:56.542 --> 30:03.208
but to talk about abstract, about formless.

30:06.083 --> 30:10.458
Because the worst condition in those days was

30:11.208 --> 30:17.208
that once they started worshipping any deity or anything,

30:19.041 --> 30:22.333
they became complete slaves of that.

30:23.041 --> 30:26.458
Like Mohammed Sahib also said â€¦ He talked of nirakar.

30:27.333 --> 30:31.000
But these two went even beyond that and they talked,

30:31.125 --> 30:33.333
There's no God, better not talk of God just now,

30:33.417 --> 30:36.333
better get your Self-realization." I did the same in the beginning.

30:36.458 --> 30:40.041
I said, "Get your Self-realization."

30:43.125 --> 30:46.208
Because anybody can start, "I am God."

30:48.291 --> 30:52.375
So they never talked about God, not at all,

30:55.041 --> 30:58.208
and they all the time said that "There is no God

30:58.333 --> 31:00.333
but it is your Self."

31:01.125 --> 31:04.041
They tabooed actually they're called as Nirishwaras,

31:04.250 --> 31:08.458
Nirishwarwad did not believe - both of them did not believe in God,

31:08.542 --> 31:11.166
but in Self-realization.

31:17.125 --> 31:22.333
They knew that I had to come and tell you about it.

31:23.125 --> 31:29.041
So Buddha has talked about the future Buddha, which is Maitreya.

31:30.458 --> 31:35.041
Ma is Mother, who is in three forms:

31:35.500 --> 31:38.458
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

31:39.291 --> 31:42.333
Any Buddhist, if you ask him to ask the question of Maitreya,

31:42.458 --> 31:45.458
he gets his realization just then.

31:48.166 --> 31:51.500
So He talked of Maitreya because He knew

31:52.041 --> 31:53.500
that when Maitreya will come,

31:54.083 --> 31:58.041
She will have to tell people about Ishwara.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.542
According to them, the people had not that â€¦ reached that stage

32:02.041 --> 32:05.500
that you could tell them about Ishwara.

32:06.083 --> 32:09.417
So they said there is no God

32:12.375 --> 32:19.041
just to accentuate Self-realization, Atmagyan,

32:19.333 --> 32:24.333
knowledge about your self, Self-realization.

32:25.417 --> 32:30.000
And early Buddhists, I'm told â€¦

32:31.083 --> 32:34.375
of course they were bhikshukas, they were ascetics,

32:34.542 --> 32:37.041
but they had the experience

32:37.166 --> 32:40.333
of the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

32:42.041 --> 32:47.333
just like the Gnostics I think, but they were very few.

32:48.208 --> 32:52.041
They were not as many as you are,

32:52.208 --> 32:55.333
but quality-wise they were very high

32:56.041 --> 33:02.291
because all of them had come through that terrible penances.

33:04.166 --> 33:07.542
So quality-wise they were very high

33:08.208 --> 33:11.125
and because the difference between them and others,

33:11.250 --> 33:13.333
the quality-wise, was so much

33:13.500 --> 33:17.375
that they could not impress the others and so

33:19.166 --> 33:21.291
just it died out, I should say.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.166
But still we had Zen, where Vidditama,

33:24.291 --> 33:28.542
is another disciple of Christ went downâ€¦ of Buddha, went down

33:29.375 --> 33:34.083
and Tao. These two are the ones

33:34.542 --> 33:42.041
which are expressing Buddha's ideals about Sahaja Yoga.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.458
Tao is nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

33:46.041 --> 33:49.041
Tao means how, how it works out,

33:50.125 --> 33:53.041
and Zen system, Zen means dhyana.

33:53.458 --> 33:57.542
So they also believed in raising the kundalini.

33:59.041 --> 34:04.542
They did not hit, at that time, anybody's spinal chord,

34:05.125 --> 34:08.041
but later on they started hitting people's spinal chord

34:08.166 --> 34:13.083
with some stick to put them into dhyana.

34:15.166 --> 34:22.542
So Tao and Zen both are offshoots of the same Buddhism,

34:23.125 --> 34:27.041
in the real sense of the word I should say,

34:28.375 --> 34:36.083
of their ascent without talking about Ishwara, about God,

34:38.250 --> 34:43.458
but aims were the same, to become Buddha,

34:44.250 --> 34:47.375
but they also died out.

34:48.208 --> 34:53.041
I met the head of the Zen who came to Me for curing.

34:53.333 --> 34:56.041
I asked him, I said,

34:56.417 --> 34:59.542
"How is it you are the leader, you are not even a kashayapa?"

35:00.083 --> 35:02.542
Kashayapa is the one who is a realized soul.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.083
So He told Me, confessed to Me they had only

35:05.208 --> 35:07.542
twenty-six Kashayapas throughout

35:08.083 --> 35:13.000
and only after the sixth century it started,

35:13.125 --> 35:18.041
and very few were there and it has died out.

35:19.041 --> 35:24.208
That means how lucky you are that you are all realized souls.

35:25.375 --> 35:30.000
So for our banyan tree is the collectivity.

35:30.458 --> 35:36.542
We have to make ourselves subtler beings,

35:37.333 --> 35:40.333
to be one with the collective,

35:42.291 --> 35:49.417
and that is very enjoyable, very beautiful.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.458
Those who cannot do it,

35:54.458 --> 35:57.333
cannot progress in Sahaja Yoga, they are problematic

35:57.458 --> 36:01.291
and they create problems and they trouble everyone.

36:01.542 --> 36:08.041
Their attention is bad and no one knows how they stand.

36:14.041 --> 36:20.333
So Buddha's message is, of course, is not to develop ego.

36:21.208 --> 36:24.083
But how do you do that?

36:24.500 --> 36:27.083
First of all, whatever you are doing

36:27.208 --> 36:29.542
you have to say, "I am not doing it.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.542
It's Mother who is doing it"

36:36.458 --> 36:42.458
or God who is doing it, I am not doing anything."

36:48.458 --> 36:53.166
But if you feel that you are doing something for Sahaja Yoga,

36:53.333 --> 36:56.417
it's better you stop doing it.

36:59.041 --> 37:01.166
But you should say, "No, it came my way.

37:01.291 --> 37:05.166
I just â€¦ I didn't do anything. I was just there. That's all."

37:07.041 --> 37:10.375
Then you have achieved a great deal.

37:15.291 --> 37:19.542
And the second thing is of desire,

37:22.166 --> 37:26.500
even desire of anything,

37:27.041 --> 37:31.542
of smallest thing or the biggest thing or

37:32.083 --> 37:35.166
even loving your children, loving you wife,

37:35.333 --> 37:38.458
this "my, mine" all those things;

37:41.333 --> 37:48.041
all these desires, if they are not fulfilled you feel frustrated,

37:48.291 --> 37:52.333
then you must know that there's something wrong with you.

38:00.041 --> 38:05.250
But, if you understand the sense of collectivity,

38:07.500 --> 38:11.542
then you can ascend very fast.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.458
I would say Indians are extremely religious,

38:17.041 --> 38:19.500
disciplined people, in a way,

38:20.208 --> 38:22.291
but they are lacking in collectivity.

38:22.417 --> 38:27.083
If they can come up to collectivity, they can shoot off.

38:28.041 --> 38:33.083
The only nation which I have found very good, is Russia.

38:33.542 --> 38:41.250
Because of Communism they are collective and desireless,

38:43.542 --> 38:48.125
because all their desires were fulfilled by Communistic ideas,

38:48.250 --> 38:54.041
they didn't have any choices left, and also they were collective.

38:54.250 --> 38:59.041
In a way Communism has suited the public not the government.

38:59.458 --> 39:02.166
While the other way round democracy has suited the government

39:02.333 --> 39:06.166
to make money but the public has suffered.

39:10.417 --> 39:13.458
So we are people

39:15.000 --> 39:21.041
who have not been able to know about collectivity.

39:21.542 --> 39:24.000
So I would say

39:24.125 --> 39:29.291
the collectivity develops faster in the West no doubt, much faster,

39:32.208 --> 39:38.041
but desireless, desirelessness is less.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.375
So it's like somebody has the teeth

39:40.458 --> 39:44.166
and somebody has the food, sort of a thing.

39:46.125 --> 39:50.083
If we can see ourselves as we are

39:53.041 --> 39:55.417
and try to understand

39:56.125 --> 39:59.208
that either we have this problem or that problem.

40:00.041 --> 40:03.542
If you could just somehow or other neutralize

40:04.166 --> 40:09.333
this one-sided problem, you could be there, because if you solve one

40:09.500 --> 40:12.333
you can go to another, from there to there.

40:12.458 --> 40:16.458
But just to stand in the center and see for yourself,

40:17.083 --> 40:21.375
"What are my desires?" Count them one by one.

40:22.375 --> 40:24.458
I mean if I have to think, "What is My desire,"

40:24.542 --> 40:28.083
I become thoughtless, really, My position is horrible.

40:29.041 --> 40:34.250
If I have to think "What should I desire now," I become thoughtless.

40:37.041 --> 40:39.458
I was â€¦ sometimes I said, I will develop some ego."

40:40.041 --> 40:42.417
I don't know from where to start.

40:44.333 --> 40:48.291
Must have some ego, after all everybody has, so why not Me?

40:51.041 --> 40:54.458
I don't know how to start it.

40:57.208 --> 41:03.500
Then, we also have these conditionings

41:03.667 --> 41:06.125
of developing this horrible thing called guilt.

41:06.291 --> 41:09.041
I mean this I, it's another â€¦ at the time of Buddha

41:09.208 --> 41:11.375
nobody had this problem, I think.

41:11.709 --> 41:18.041
This is a modern technique, to feel guilty;

41:19.458 --> 41:21.333
some sort of a modernism in it

41:21.500 --> 41:24.458
because I don't know how it is worked out.

41:25.166 --> 41:31.166
And this modernism of this horrible thing called guilty"

41:33.041 --> 41:37.333
is something really has come to My lot to clear out,

41:37.500 --> 41:41.083
not at the time of Buddha, He never had this.

41:41.542 --> 41:45.041
Otherwise He would have paved way for Me, but that He did not.

41:45.166 --> 41:47.709
He has left it to Me to clear out your

41:48.125 --> 41:53.000
Left Vishuddhis and Mine also all the time hurting Me here.

41:58.041 --> 42:02.041
So this horrible thing specially Western mind,

42:02.166 --> 42:09.083
Indians don't have guilt, nothing but this has to be overcome.

42:12.458 --> 42:16.542
As you know that Buddha and Mahavira

42:17.083 --> 42:21.041
both support the center of Agnya.

42:22.542 --> 42:28.375
So if you have to have a very clear-cut Agnya chakra

42:29.166 --> 42:34.458
then on one side you should be desireless,

42:36.333 --> 42:39.500
you should forgive, kshum."

42:40.333 --> 42:43.542
Kshum is the bija mantra, is to forgive;

42:44.166 --> 42:48.417
bija mantra of right side.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.083
Kshum, I forgive.

42:55.041 --> 42:57.500
And the left side is hum."

42:58.250 --> 43:02.041
Like the left sided person always feels, "Oh, I'm no good."

43:02.375 --> 43:06.041
This he has to say, "No, I'm good."

43:06.333 --> 43:08.500
Hum," I am."

43:11.041 --> 43:14.041
So hum and kshum: these are two bija mantras,

43:14.166 --> 43:17.041
which we have to say. Of course, if you say they will act

43:17.166 --> 43:21.041
because, after all, now your pranas have become pranavas,

43:21.333 --> 43:24.542
your breath has become enlightened,

43:25.291 --> 43:29.375
but rather weak I should say, but doesn't matter.

43:30.166 --> 43:33.458
Your mantras can act.

43:34.250 --> 43:41.041
You must use these two bija mantras to clear out your Agnyas.

43:42.166 --> 43:45.125
But Mahavira has a solution for this

43:45.291 --> 43:47.500
that after realization if you catch your Agnya,

43:48.041 --> 43:50.083
you get a terrible headache.

43:50.458 --> 43:52.250
That's Mahavira's style.

43:53.041 --> 43:57.458
You do anything wrong, you get punishment;

44:01.208 --> 44:06.041
you indulge into anything, you are punished;

44:06.333 --> 44:09.166
you go against Sahaja Yoga, you are punished.

44:09.333 --> 44:14.375
I'm not doing anything, it's Mahavira, simultaneously working.

44:15.500 --> 44:22.417
If you try to be overly smart, you are outsmarted.

44:25.458 --> 44:31.333
So these two forces are working from the right, left, left to right.

44:34.250 --> 44:38.083
If you overdo right, then the left hits you hard.

44:38.542 --> 44:43.041
If you overdo left, then the right hits you hard.

44:43.333 --> 44:46.125
Both of them are like, really like,

44:48.208 --> 44:51.458
double-pronged attacks.

44:52.417 --> 44:55.291
One is, says, Don't have desire."

44:55.458 --> 45:01.083
All right, you have desire punished, this side.

45:02.250 --> 45:06.041
Like, some people say, "I must have children, I must have children."

45:06.542 --> 45:08.375
You give them the children, they say,

45:08.500 --> 45:11.125
"Mother, why this horrible child you have given me;

45:11.291 --> 45:14.291
he's such a horrible thing."

45:18.041 --> 45:19.458
Then somebody says, "Mother,

45:20.041 --> 45:25.250
give me a lady from, say, Maharashtra."

45:25.333 --> 45:29.542
Recently there was a case like that. She was bothering too much,

45:30.125 --> 45:32.458
"Mother, give me one lady from Maharashtra."

45:33.041 --> 45:37.041
And a real special style came to punish.

45:37.250 --> 45:40.000
They said, "No more from Maharashtra,"

45:41.041 --> 45:44.542
and she was reallyâ€¦ I've never heard of such a woman in Maharashtra.

45:45.417 --> 45:46.542
Horrible.

45:49.041 --> 45:52.000
Because she was insisting on it, so she had it,

45:52.333 --> 45:55.041
and she says, "No more from Maharashtra; baarpre baap."

45:55.166 --> 45:57.417
"No, no," I said, "everybody is excellent.

45:57.542 --> 46:02.375
This was an exceptional case, came just to punish you."

46:04.500 --> 46:08.625
So, to have any desires â€¦ if you cross a certain limit

46:09.041 --> 46:12.041
you are punished, and that is done by Mahavira.

46:12.458 --> 46:15.667
In a small way or a big way.

46:19.250 --> 46:24.208
Like, there was a little boy who came to London, very bombastic,

46:25.250 --> 46:29.166
and he wanted to buy something for himself.

46:29.375 --> 46:33.125
I took him to an ordinary shop and there was a very nice coat,

46:33.291 --> 46:35.417
full wool and all that. He wouldn't buy.

46:35.583 --> 46:38.166
"I want to go to a big shop." I said, "All right."

46:38.333 --> 46:42.041
So, I said, "I'm not coming." I sent His father.

46:42.375 --> 46:46.709
And he came back with an artificial

46:47.250 --> 46:53.041
coat from that shop without knowing that it was  artificial

46:53.625 --> 46:56.625
because he wouldn't take something from an ordinary shop.

46:57.083 --> 46:59.625
So in the big shop, very nicely, big price they gave

47:00.083 --> 47:03.041
and this they got.

47:04.041 --> 47:10.542
Every minute Sahaja yogis must know that there is a

47:14.542 --> 47:18.125
Mahavira sitting round.

47:19.500 --> 47:25.166
Also, Buddha is there who gives you

47:27.125 --> 47:33.375
an indication that "Don't do this.

47:33.583 --> 47:35.583
Do not desire so much."

47:36.041 --> 47:40.250
He puts limitations to you; but if you don't listen, then all right,

47:40.417 --> 47:42.041
Mahavira is there to correct you.

47:42.208 --> 47:46.709
Up to a point He goes, then you get headaches,

47:47.125 --> 47:51.041
then you say, "Mother, why did I get headaches?"

47:53.041 --> 47:56.041
You asked for it.

47:56.417 --> 47:59.041
It's such an automatic machinery

47:59.291 --> 48:05.041
that we have to be very careful as Sahaja yogis.

48:07.041 --> 48:11.250
So, today's understanding should be that

48:11.458 --> 48:17.041
we all should become collective from inside.

48:17.333 --> 48:22.041
We should not grudge or grumble about everything

48:23.041 --> 48:25.041
and enjoy the collectivity.

48:25.583 --> 48:29.667
But the second side of collectivity is this,

48:30.083 --> 48:33.500
that, do not try to exploit the collectivity

48:33.667 --> 48:36.041
otherwise you'll be in trouble.

48:36.291 --> 48:40.000
Like, I've seen some people don't know how to use their bathrooms.

48:40.250 --> 48:44.083
When you are collective you have to be

48:45.125 --> 48:49.333
respecting the collectivity of others.

48:51.250 --> 48:57.417
By your presence another person should not, by any chance, suffer,

48:58.291 --> 49:02.250
or should not feel in any way

49:04.125 --> 49:09.709
insulted or inconvenienced.

49:12.458 --> 49:15.709
So when you are in the collective it should be such that

49:16.125 --> 49:19.041
another person should enjoy your company,

49:19.542 --> 49:23.041
enjoy your being there.

49:23.500 --> 49:29.417
That is something where there is no problem.

49:34.041 --> 49:38.166
But if you are demanding and if you are asking for things and

49:38.542 --> 49:40.291
you think no end of yourself,

49:40.458 --> 49:42.500
you can not at all collective, by any chance,

49:42.625 --> 49:44.417
but you'll suffer for that,

49:47.709 --> 49:51.041
automatically you will suffer.

49:52.458 --> 49:59.458
If this is realized and understood properly, your Agnya is solved.

50:04.208 --> 50:06.625
Like anger.

50:11.208 --> 50:16.458
There are people always boast, "I'm very angry with him." Boast.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.333
But just make that anger into forgiveness

50:24.125 --> 50:27.709
and you will see the person, instead of you getting into

50:28.166 --> 50:31.041
problems, he will get into problems.

50:32.041 --> 50:39.125
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will upset him, automatically.

50:41.041 --> 50:45.041
It's the biggest weapon you have got is to forgive.

50:45.375 --> 50:51.041
And this is shown in Buddha's character throughout.

50:58.709 --> 51:04.542
And this will give you self-respect

51:06.250 --> 51:09.083
that you are not disturbed by anything, you see.

51:09.583 --> 51:13.041
Like a ship has to be seaworthy.

51:13.250 --> 51:15.458
If you put the ship on the sea and if it breaks,

51:15.583 --> 51:17.709
what's the use of making a ship?

51:18.166 --> 51:19.500
What's the use of a Sahaja yogi

51:19.667 --> 51:23.333
who gets disturbed at every moment?

51:24.667 --> 51:27.583
You have to be seaworthy, and if you are seaworthy

51:28.041 --> 51:30.041
nothing can disturb you. All right.

51:30.208 --> 51:33.291
The elephant is walking and the dogs are barking all right,

51:33.458 --> 51:35.041
let them bark. What does it matter?

51:35.250 --> 51:37.500
The elephant looks this side, like that,

51:37.667 --> 51:40.625
sometimes takes some water and blesses them with water.

51:41.083 --> 51:45.667
"All right. Quieten down; so that your head will be cooled down."

51:48.291 --> 51:52.333
That will give you self-esteem

51:52.583 --> 51:58.041
and you will know what you are much higher than others.

52:00.500 --> 52:04.709
And this is what is â€¦ how to get rid of your ego,

52:05.166 --> 52:09.083
which is a very, very big problem according to you people.

52:10.083 --> 52:14.041
"Mother, how to get rid of ego?"

52:14.333 --> 52:18.709
Ego can be said, "You go."

52:21.125 --> 52:26.041
When this I-ness goes away, the Self rises.

52:27.125 --> 52:30.000
What is there to feel hurt? What is there to feel bad?

52:30.166 --> 52:34.041
What is there to hurt others?

52:34.542 --> 52:36.625
Han [Hindi meaning 'yes'] all right, you are cheated,

52:37.083 --> 52:41.041
very good; at least you have not cheated anyone, be happy about it.

52:41.458 --> 52:48.125
But once you are without ego means you have surrendered yourself,

52:48.375 --> 52:51.417
no one can cheat you.

52:56.041 --> 52:59.250
Can you understand that?

53:01.041 --> 53:08.041
No one can cheat you because there is some

53:08.250 --> 53:11.583
higher force, which is looking after you.

53:16.667 --> 53:21.041
This is the way we should understand Buddha.

53:21.333 --> 53:26.041
This is â€¦ we should know our Buddha qualities.

53:26.709 --> 53:30.041
This is how our ego can be dissolved.

53:30.458 --> 53:34.083
When you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

53:34.542 --> 53:42.333
That just means that you give that horrible ego a complete holiday,

53:44.583 --> 53:51.083
it means that. That is how this ego disappears.

53:53.041 --> 53:57.000
I think all your, yourâ€¦ just now,

53:57.208 --> 54:02.041
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you, somehow.

54:02.500 --> 54:06.041
And then you'll laugh at everything;

54:06.333 --> 54:13.208
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy everything.

54:15.542 --> 54:17.417
May God bless you.
