00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:12.092
So Sahaja Yoga is not what I say. [That] is not Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:12.172 --> 00:00:18.538
What you say, what you talk you must walk.

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:26.623
Because I say so, that doesn’t mean, by
listening to Me you become Sahaj Yogis. No.

00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:33.032
You have to practise it. And practising is
very easy. It’s very easy to practise Sahaja Yoga

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:40.177
because it is innately within you. It
is joy giving - you enjoy your virtues.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:45.030
And you are so secure, so confident.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.533
Moreover, such friendships, such
brotherhood, such relationships!

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.749
And this so-called trend of individuality is not very useful

00:00:59.848 --> 00:01:05.905
because it is against the spirit of totality, of the whole.

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:11.185
So individuality is all right; like on a tree
every leaf is different; every flower is different.

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:17.110
Everything is different in the Nature
you see because of what you call variety.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.360
There should be variety. You should not be dressed all
of them like military people all of you looking the same.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.598
There should be variety; that’s how there’s beauty.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:43.738
But that doesn’t mean that you have your
own individual ideas about religion. You cannot.

00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:47.614
All these ideas must come from within.

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:54.346
Whatever are your reactions to
outside should not be your ideas.

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:57.547
There should be inspired revelation from within.

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:04.337
And if it comes to revelation, then you’ll
find that all of them are just the same.

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:14.753
There’s no inconsistency, nothing inconsistent.
Everything just smoothly moves into one ocean.
