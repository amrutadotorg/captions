1
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:26,667
Shri Raja Rajeshwari Puja

2
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:35,250
December 6th, 1991, Madras, India

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,792
Today we’ll be having Shri Ganesha Puja,

4
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:47,375
followed by Raja Rajeshwari.

5
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:56,083
So many names have been described of the Goddess:

6
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,834
specially Adi Shankaracharya called Her Raja

7
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:04,999
Rajeshwari, meaning She’s the Queen of all the Queens.

8
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:20,208
Also for Mother Mary they have used this title in the West.

9
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,750
These ideas have come from the pagan religion,

10
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:38,041
as I have told you before, and that they didn’t come by

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,375
the description of Mother Mary in the Bible.

12
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:54,250
That shows that there has been lot of changes into the

13
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:59,125
script of holy Bible.

14
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:05,959
Also there has been lot of changes in the script of

15
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,000
Indian scriptures, even Gita.

16
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:20,166
And that’s how the derailment in every religion started.

17
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:25,250
And the intellectuals took advantage of it

18
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:30,291
and started projecting their own idea,

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,208
saying things, describing things

20
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,542
which were absolutely against divine Power.

21
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:48,917
You are all very fortunate people on this Earth

22
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,208
that you have discovered the reality,

23
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,083
and you see that all these things

24
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,750
which were mythological are true;

25
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,208
all the things that are intellectual is not true;

26
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:14,250
also whatever are used for the purpose of dividing people

27
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,709
from each other are not true.

28
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,375
Because we believe in all the religions,

29
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:27,166
that’s why every religious person, so-called,

30
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,083
is against us;

31
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,333
because you are supposed to believe only in one religion

32
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,000
and fight all the rest.

33
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,333
If you believe in all religions, that means you are

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,834
absolutely not religious – this is the concept.

35
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,458
And that shocked them, that we believe in all the religions

36
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,166
and we respect all the incarnations, and that we believe in

37
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:55,166
the integration of all these deities.

38
00:03:56,458 --> 00:04:01,333
Regarding Ganesha, it must have been a big revelation for

39
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,625
you people who are from the Western countries.

40
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,125
Even in the north I don’t find Ganesha is so much

41
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,667
worshipped as worshipped in the south, specially in this

42
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:16,750
area, and also in Maharashtra; because in Maharashtra

43
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,208
we have eight swayambhu Ganeshas,

44
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,667
and they all believe in it.

45
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,375
It is now said that it is all blind faith, and this and that.

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,542
But now you have seen Ganesha standing behind Me,

47
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,583
within Me:

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,417
it’s just to prove that there is a deity called Ganesha.

49
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,417
You’ll be given those photographs where Ganesha is

50
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,083
halfway sitting here, and the rest is My sari and all that.

51
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:58,792
But all this is to convince you

52
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:05,625
that there is a deity which is Shri Ganesh,

53
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:10,333
and that He acts, works through Mooladhara.

54
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,208
This knowledge was known to Indian people

55
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,333
thousands of years back.

56
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:24,291
This kuchipudi dancing started seven centuries before Christ,

57
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:28,458
so you can imagine, the concept of Ganesha must

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,792
have been thousands of years back.

59
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:37,583
So the people were very much evolved spiritually in this

60
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:42,083
country, and they knew what are the deities are, how they

61
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:47,542
look like, what are their functions are – though it was a

62
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,333
secret knowledge for the general public.

63
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,792
But whatever the saints said was accepted,

64
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:58,166
because there was no ego about it.

65
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,000
I have been trying to locate why

66
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,709
in the West people develop so much of ego.

67
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:10,041
Still I have not been able to find out the basic reason,

68
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:17,792
why this kind of aggressiveness comes in through the ego part.

69
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:22,959
One can say that competitiveness and all that, but this has

70
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:30,125
been the history in the West that even the people who

71
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:37,041
followed Christ, which was nothing but humility absolutely

72
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,375
absolutely writ large everywhere,

73
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,417
still those people were so aggressive.

74
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:48,208
Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand.

75
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,208
And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay,

76
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,542
which is the quality of Shri Ganesha – Vinayaka.

77
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,500
“Vidya vinayen shobhate.” “Vidya” means “The knowledge

78
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:05,959
is only decorated with humility.”

79
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:10,375
So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists,

80
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,417
and the great gurus who were there.

81
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,250
And the guru invited Me to his academy,

82
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:24,583
and he made all kinds of offerings as they would do

83
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,583
to a Goddess.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,250
I was so much touched, the ready acceptance

85
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
of Me and of Sahaja Yoga.

86
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,000
Even this Kalakshetra, which was dominated by

87
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,834
Theosophical Society – though this lady

88
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,250
didn’t bother so much about Theosophical Society –

89
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:51,500
and she had created this big auditorium and all that,

90
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,959
and everything she dedicated to art.

91
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:58,583
She didn’t allow Theosophical Society enter into it.

92
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:04,417
Despite all that, how they accepted Me, all of them,

93
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:12,417
you can see so clearly their devotion and understanding.

94
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,291
To be humble with a saint is absolutely

95
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,750
an unwritten law of this country.

96
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:27,792
And a saint is not to be challenged, not to be dominated.

97
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,125
Whatever the saint says must be accepted.

98
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:37,792
So the first quality that Ganesha should give us is vinay –

99
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,250
“vinay” meaning the humility.

100
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,667
The humility is not superficial, like you go on saying

101
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,875
“sorry” or “excuse me”, “I’m afraid” -

102
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,417
not that way. It’s not watchik,

103
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,917
it’s not just lip-service, but from within

104
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,500
the humility has to come.

105
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,417
Now the humility is, of course, is always marred by ego

106
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,583
and the ego just keeps you afloat, and you never

107
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:15,709
understand that you have been egoistical.

108
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,000
Even when I talk about ego, people think that

109
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,500
Mother is saying about somebody else there,

110
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:23,750
they never think “it’s me who has this ego.”

111
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,417
So Ganesha is the killer of ego,

112
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,291
because humility is the only thing that really

113
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,166
can neutralize your ego.

114
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,959
To humble down yourself, you have to see what?

115
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,999
For example in this country you have come, very simple

116
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:46,542
people, you see, living very simply, they don’t have all

117
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:52,250
these sophisticated things around them; eating

118
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,333
with their hands, eating on the plant and leaves, you see.

119
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,458
And according to certain ladies who have lived here,

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,750
the Westerners, they think they are all primitive.

121
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:13,500
But see the way they have developed this art.

122
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,208
This kind of swiftness and this kind of, even jumping

123
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,542
this kind, you cannot achieve.

124
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:30,083
Now, what is the reason for this kind of working,

125
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:34,041
is humility towards art.

126
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,333
Art is to be respected.

127
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,417
A guru is to be respected.

128
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:45,208
Respect is the only way to learning anything.

129
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,500
That is sort of ingrained in an Indian blood, I think,

130
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:57,458
that you must obey your guru implicitly, implicitly.

131
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,917
And this guru is training so many people,

132
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,583
there are so many girls there,

133
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:11,458
not for anything but just to express his art.

134
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,166
He doesn’t get much money, I could see that.

135
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,959
They have very little provision,

136
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,125
and also he doesn’t charge too much.

137
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,500
But the dedication he has is like

138
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:30,667
the dedication of Shri Ganesha to His Mother.

139
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,333
And the way he is completely drawn into it:

140
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:41,417
all other things are not important.

141
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,625
So for humility you have to withdraw your attention

142
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,834
from other things.

143
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,166
This is an extremely important thing.

144
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:59,458
If your attention is going to your other problems,

145
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,417
this, that, or if you are trying to come to Sahaja Yoga

146
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:10,667
through other channels, it’s not going to work out.

147
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:15,667
You have to humble down in your heart,

148
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,417
absolutely humble down.

149
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,250
He's innocent, that’s why He’s humble.

150
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:29,041
If you are not innocent, then you cannot be humble.

151
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,583
Sign of innocence is humility.

152
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,625
A good child, a nice innocent child is extremely obedient.

153
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,291
Whatever you tell them, they just obey.

154
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:52,000
I know My grandchildren – once we were going to Nepal,

155
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,583
and it was very cold there.

156
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,083
And their mother said,

157
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,125
“They won’t take anything on their heads.”

158
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,709
I said, “I’ll do it in one, one minute.”

159
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,999
I just called them, gave them pieces of ordinary cloth.

160
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,959
I said, “You have to cover your head”. “All right.”

161
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,375
They put it on their head,

162
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,999
put it properly, fixed it up.

163
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,458
They were looking a little weird, but they didn’t mind.

164
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,959
This is what

165
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,834
is missing,

166
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:28,875
and that’s why we find the depth is less.

167
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,291
Not just only the conditionings –

168
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,542
I would not say the conditioning.

169
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,375
People are out of conditioning;

170
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,999
even Indians have become like that.

171
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:51,750
It’s difficult for them to be humble, very difficult.

172
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,250
You may call Western influence, or maybe that they have

173
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,041
forgotten their past.

174
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,750
But humility is so important.

175
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,875
Like I must tell you, from our childhood, though I was born

176
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,583
in a Christian family, we had to touch the Mother Earth

177
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,417
and ask for forgiveness first,

178
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,542
so you put it to your head.

179
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,291
And touch the feet of your parents,

180
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:18,875
and all the elders of the family – isn’t it so?

181
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:23,291
Touch everybody’s feet who are elder in the family.

182
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,291
Even some old servants, you see, who had looked after our

183
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:31,458
elder brothers and all that – touch their feet also.

184
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,750
But that humility is lacking.

185
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:41,417
And that dignity that elders should have is also not there.

186
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,792
But whatever it is, it was our duty to touch everybody’s feet,

187
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,250
and not to discuss the elders.

188
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,041
So this will create such a beautiful atmosphere in Sahaja Yoga

189
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:03,250
if you insist that “Am I humble in doing this?”

190
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,000
Just ask a question,

191
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:10,166
“Have I been humble in doing this, or in saying this?”

192
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:16,542
Now the problems are criticizing the leaders.

193
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,875
They are leaders because they deserve it.

194
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,834
The day I find they are no good, I’ll throw them out –

195
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,458
also you know that very well.

196
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,000
But there is no humility.

197
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,250
Then the humility is replaced by ego, and that ego creates

198
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,500
an ego in the leaders.

199
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,917
The leaders become egoistical, and so many leaders

200
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:46,083
are thrown out.

201
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,125
I mean I just don’t know, when the balance has to come,

202
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:55,417
whether I should blame the members or the leaders.

203
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,583
So Mother has appointed them as leaders,

204
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,959
so let us be humble.

205
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,542
After all, there must be some reason why Mother has asked

206
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,083
them to be the leaders.

207
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,000
Why should we try to quarrel with them, find faults?

208
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:15,625
Like a union we form.

209
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:22,959
So Shri Ganesha, who is so humble, and His ganas

210
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,458
are even more humble in a way,

211
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,500
because He won’t tolerate any gana

212
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:32,458
who is not humble to Mother.

213
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:38,417
With a little movement of the eyes they are there to fight,

214
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,875
and to do whatever it is they are suggested.

215
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:46,000
And they understand every angle of the eye of their Mother,

216
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,667
what is to be done.

217
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,999
So this kind of dedication only

218
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,792
can make you deeper and deeper.

219
00:16:55,417 --> 00:17:00,999
Now may be that the way we know about that in the West,

220
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,500
we have to spread out more, we have to advertise more,

221
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,041
we have to talk about ourselves more,

222
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,959
we have to boast about ourselves more.

223
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,959
The more you do it, the more successful you’ll be.

224
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,250
That’s what you see it every day.

225
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,166
They boast “I believe” – you see,

226
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,166
who are you to believe or not to believe?

227
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,208
Who are you to say this?

228
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,083
But sort of, see your image has to go like that –

229
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:36,375
a man of great personality, or some sort of a big profile.

230
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:42,375
You create a profile; absolutely artificial, nonsensical.

231
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,125
And very surprising, to such a profile which is so

232
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:51,375
artificial, people bow.

233
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:56,792
Maybe they are also artificial, that’s why they bow to

234
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,999
these artificial people.

235
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,417
I’m surprised. I mean, these are well-known crooks,

236
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,834
so people know they are crooks, they have done all kinds,

237
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,709
but still they will prostrate before them.

238
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,000
Because maybe that they want some sort of a material

239
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,542
advantage out of it, or I don’t know,

240
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:20,208
some sort of an artificial advantage.

241
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,750
Even a taking a photograph with such a man is regarded

242
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:26,750
as something very great.

243
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:37,792
So all these ideas must be seen through by Sahaja yogis.

244
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,333
They have to see through this joke, this drama, what’s

245
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:46,083
going on, and also reflect it back and introspect and see,

246
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,083
“I hope I don’t have this in me.”

247
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:55,917
Sometimes we laugh at others but we ourselves are in it.

248
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,542
So once we start introspecting, we see within ourselves,

249
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:05,917
“Yes, this is there.”

250
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,291
There are certain Sahaja yogis in certain countries,

251
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,959
I’m always being reported as, suddenly they say,

252
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,959
“Mother has given me special powers.” Or they say,

253
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,500
“I am Maha Mataji” – also there was one like that,

254
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,250
Maha Mataji.

255
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,542
I’ve never said I am Mataji even.

256
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,250
You people call Me that, I’ve never said that.

257
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,792
But he said, “I am Maha Mataji.”

258
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,542
You can call him mad, you can call him anything,

259
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:44,125
but it is definitely his arrogance

260
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:49,041
has prospered in such a way that

261
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,500
he doesn’t see what he’s talking about.

262
00:19:56,834 --> 00:20:02,625
This is how also you pamper the ego of your leaders,

263
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,542
by attacking him.

264
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,709
The more you attack him, he reacts and when he reacts,

265
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,667
his ego goes on pumping like that.

266
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,834
As I told you, today we are going to do

267
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,208
the worship of Raja Rajeshwari.

268
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,291
I have never said this to you before.

269
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,417
I’ve never asked you to read Guru Gita,

270
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,291
for the same reason.

271
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:35,917
I’ve never told you that She is Raja Rajeshwari,

272
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:41,000
because again that might little bit go into your ego,

273
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,000
“How can She be the Queen of all the Queens?”

274
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,792
Of course, Christ’s Mother is all right,

275
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,208
but not Mataji – it’s too much!

276
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,667
So I never told you this.

277
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,166
I said, “Baba, I’m a humble Mother, that’s all,

278
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,999
Holy Mother” – finished.

279
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:04,792
Creates holes here, that’s why it may, may be!

280
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:12,041
Whatever it is, I could understand what was the problem,

281
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,583
and in a very humorous way we have managed many things.

282
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:21,417
But still I feel that, see the way these artists are,

283
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:25,959
the way these people are, the way they are creating things –

284
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,792
may not be according to your ideas about decorativeness,

285
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,041
or all that.

286
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,125
You might say it’s rather loud, or maybe this, that,

287
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:39,333
as it is, you see, always in the brain.

288
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,667
“It could have been much less, there should be some

289
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
spaced-out thing,” and all that.

290
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,250
You might start criticizing, because that‘s one of

291
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,875
the qualities of people who are not humble,

292
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,583
that they think they have a capacity to criticize anything.

293
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,792
“Oh, I don’t like this color, it’s no good.”

294
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:07,250
But the artist has made it with his heart – appreciate it!

295
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,959
So the second point is to appreciate.

296
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,250
Appreciate your life; whatever it is, appreciate,

297
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,208
accept it.

298
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,999
But not with reluctance.

299
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:28,458
All these mental ideas in the head that art means this

300
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:32,917
and art means that, has led us to this situation that

301
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,291
we are not going to have any more Rembrandts nor

302
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,583
Michelangelo – finished.

303
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:42,750
It’s not mental, art is never mental.

304
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,625
It’s coming from inside, and whatever is coming from

305
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:53,458
inside cannot be compared with outside our ideas.

306
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:58,333
So the appreciation part – I mean, you can say South

307
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:03,625
Indians wear very, very loud dresses in our own style.

308
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:07,999
But to Me they do not.

309
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,917
Some might say something else.

310
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,792
Also I’ve noticed the North Indians must criticize

311
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,834
the South Indians, the South Indians must criticize

312
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,166
the North Indians.

313
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,291
But whatever it is, what is – nobody’s getting

314
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,083
good out of anyone. It’s stupidity, it is stupidity.

315
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,208
But to appreciate

316
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:41,709
and to accept, you imbibe that.

317
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:47,625
North Indians cannot like South Indian food, whatever it is.

318
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,875
Whatever you may try, they cannot.

319
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,792
They cannot like their music also.

320
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,208
Now, can you imagine the whole of India divided

321
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,875
into two parts,

322
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,083
and the South Indians cannot like North Indian food nor

323
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,458
the North Indian dancing –

324
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,166
I mean, even in our country.

325
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,917
We’re so divisible, is this country is, that a person

326
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:15,000
from Rameshwaram won’t like food from Madras,

327
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:19,166
a person from Madras won’t like the food from Delhi.

328
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:26,000
So these divisive methods have come through

329
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,834
the innate humility not being you.

330
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,667
If you can enjoy each and everything,

331
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,917
then you are humble.

332
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:44,834
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

333
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:50,750
then you are humble.

334
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,542
This humility is a very deep-down character,

335
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:01,875
because from Mooladhara it comes.

336
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,166
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

337
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:12,667
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

338
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:19,417
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

339
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,875
He just moves, with all His big stomach

340
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,875
He moves on a little rat.

341
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:35,583
No assertion of His powers – He’s so humble,

342
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:39,375
He’s so sweet.

343
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,709
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and

344
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,999
things and vibrations.

345
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:50,959
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

346
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:57,834
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

347
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,041
instead of denouncing this, that.

348
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:04,417
I mean, like even the color of this room you may not like,

349
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:05,625
this you may not like.

350
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,375
I mean, there are so many things you don’t like.

351
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,875
Then I have to ask, “What do you like?”

352
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,750
“Baked beans” – all right!

353
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,333
We have to open out ourselves.

354
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:31,417
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

355
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:35,250
Without humility you cannot, because you are objecting

356
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:39,458
to everything, creating a wall.

357
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:45,166
Only the humility will make you spread out.

358
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:49,375
Today, the first day of our tour,

359
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:58,208
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

360
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:04,291
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

361
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,166
and is beautiful.

362
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,750
You saw that little girl playing veena, such a difficult

363
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:16,000
Adi Vadyam, primordial instrument, playing with such

364
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,625
sweetness, with such deftness, and so humble.

365
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,500
And she came to Me and she said,

366
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,792
“Mother, what a privilege it was that I got

367
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:28,959
the opportunity to play before You.”

368
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,959
Just imagine – such a genius.

369
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,750
Another one who met Me last time was a mandolin player

370
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,000
about the same age, maybe younger.

371
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,792
I mean, he is now world-renowned, but when he played

372
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,709
before Me, wouldn’t accept any money, nothing,

373
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,750
he just went into ecstasy.

374
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,542
Even the dancer, she told Me she went into ecstasy

375
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,875
when she saw Me,

376
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,709
and she just danced so well with such vigor.

377
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,333
And she – she had temperature.

378
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:01,959
She said, “My temperature is gone, everything,

379
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:05,542
I am perfectly all right.”

380
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,458
Look at those artists. I mean, they have never known Me,

381
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,792
they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

382
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:16,041
But what a humble understanding of Divinity –

383
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:20,500
because they are humble.

384
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,834
Divinity never asserts itself, doesn’t propagate itself,

385
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,083
doesn’t make a big sound.

386
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,041
So now they are here. Come along.

387
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,917
Is that Guido?

388
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:35,917
Italians have come.

389
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:42,750
That’s why I delayed the puja today.

390
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,375
Is that Guido? Just call him.

391
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:59,458
Guido is too humble to come forward.

392
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,667
Come in, come in.

393
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:27,208
Just move forward a little bit.

394
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:40,125
May God bless you.

395
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,959
I’ve been waiting for you!

396
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:55,333
Please, please be seated.

397
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,500
No, no, come! Come along.

398
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,750
Can you – you can all sit in front, there is space.

399
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,125
Just come …. you can all sit there.

400
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:18,583
I have to keep them pleased, you see,

401
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:23,542
because I am living in Italy!

402
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,333
Just come on ….

403
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,667
It’s all right, so they might get a part of it.

404
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,583
Just come in front, there.

405
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,667
Or you can sit in the middle, doesn’t matter.

406
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:46,000
You can sit there wherever you are, yes, you can.

407
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:57,999
Come forward, come forward, there’s space here.

408
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,750
So I was telling them about Shri Ganesha,

409
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:17,667
that His essential power comes through His humility;

410
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:22,083
and that we all have to be extremely humble,

411
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:26,542
extremely humble, appreciating everything.

412
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:30,083
Of course, you must make them hear My lecture –

413
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,500
they have already taped it – so they will know

414
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,041
what I am saying today.

415
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,083
But now we can have the puja.

416
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:42,792
May God bless you.
