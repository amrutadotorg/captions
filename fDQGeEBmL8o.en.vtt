Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella,
15th September, 1991

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:42.482
Today is the happiest day for all of you,
for the whole universe, because Shri Ganesha

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.222
was created.

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:57.802
He was created to emit auspiciousness through
His Chaitanya [- Divine Vibrations –ed.].

00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:07.071
First, the whole cosmos was filled with this
Chaitanyasrishti [- creation of Divine Vibrations

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.071
–ed.].

00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:16.731
Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created
all the matter.

00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:33.662
But

00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:54.862
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power
was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya

00:01:54.862 --> 00:02:04.482
has many aspects, but specially in Shri Ganesha,
it is auspiciousness.

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:11.372
In these modern times people have lost the
sense of auspiciousness.

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:18.892
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya,
is auspicious, is shubh, and whatever does

00:02:18.892 --> 00:02:25.562
not is not by any chance auspicious.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:35.182
So first of all, whatever you worship, whatever
you accept, all of them have to be auspicious

00:02:35.182 --> 00:02:37.002
things.

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:46.381
Every shape has a coefficience and all these
shapes which you see, not necessarily give

00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:48.271
vibrations.

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:56.232
But in the human beings also, we find there
are many people, like you, who have Chaitanya

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:58.101
flowing in them.

00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:05.551
But this Chaitanya when it flows, we just
take Shri Ganesha for granted.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:10.812
We do not understand that we have to awaken
Shri Ganesha within us.

00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:11.812
Means what?

00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:13.902
What we have to do?

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:22.862
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in
you and as I said that innocence cannot be

00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:30.682
lost, so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal
child – He cannot be lost and He cannot

00:03:30.682 --> 00:03:32.342
be destroyed.

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:34.571
So He’s all the time there.

00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:48.611
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering
the great personality of innocence.

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:54.521
But it is always there present.

00:03:54.521 --> 00:04:02.821
So now, what should we do to keep this Ganesha
all the time shining within us?

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:12.081
Is to first remember that you were made in
the same pattern as Shri Ganesh.

00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:21.622
But His Kundalini is on His stomach; His pure
desire is on His stomach.

00:04:21.622 --> 00:04:34.152
It’s very significant to understand why
it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:46.332
That means He does not have to conquer the
temptations of Mooladhara at all.

00:04:46.332 --> 00:04:55.562
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach, that
means He is also beyond the temptations of

00:04:55.562 --> 00:05:14.462
food, of power or anything because His stomach
represents absolute abandonment, absolute

00:05:14.462 --> 00:05:15.642
freedom.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:22.962
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…
these days there is a big fashion that you

00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:24.082
cannot have a big belly.

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:32.472
I mean this is becoming a big… not only
fashion but a big business.

00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:35.602
But as age grows, you have to have it.

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:42.732
Even small children have that and they look
so sweet.

00:05:42.732 --> 00:05:50.592
Those people who are very thin must understand
that they might be getting some prizes in

00:05:50.592 --> 00:06:05.722
the… maybe beauty contest or something,
but they do not have that majesty, that royalty,

00:06:05.722 --> 00:06:10.402
that dignity in them as they should have.

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:14.002
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:20.772
He has a head with a trunk.

00:06:20.772 --> 00:06:23.342
He accepts it.

00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:26.612
Of course, is important, He should have that.

00:06:26.612 --> 00:06:32.562
Because head of the elephant suggests that
He is not like a human being who develops

00:06:32.562 --> 00:06:42.392
ego, superego, conditionings, but He is just
all the time one with the Divine.

00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:48.832
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

00:06:48.832 --> 00:06:51.902
that He is made of.

00:06:51.902 --> 00:07:00.272
He doesn’t aspire to something – some
entrepreneurs put some ideas and He wouldn’t

00:07:00.272 --> 00:07:02.212
go run after them.

00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:10.972
He won’t try to change Himself; He won’t
try to create that fashion and all that.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:23.772
He is what He is… because He is a satisfied
soul.

00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:37.372
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri

00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:39.342
Ganesha.

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:49.952
When you have all the powers within you, you
know you are powerful, then you don’t hanker

00:07:49.952 --> 00:08:00.142
after all these things and you don’t try
to make a position or an impression of others.

00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:09.292
For example, He would never go and read books
like how to impress people.

00:08:09.292 --> 00:08:15.012
Very common.

00:08:15.012 --> 00:08:23.592
So now, as you are created in the same image
of Shri Ganesh, you have to understand that

00:08:23.592 --> 00:08:31.852
you have to accept whatever God has given
you, whatever position He has given you.

00:08:31.852 --> 00:08:33.342
Same with Christ.

00:08:33.342 --> 00:08:38.582
Christ accepted His father who was just a
carpenter.

00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:45.122
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

00:08:45.122 --> 00:08:55.612
because He was so powerful – what more power
can He have?

00:08:55.612 --> 00:09:02.662
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:10.072
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

00:09:10.072 --> 00:09:12.192
He knew what it was.

00:09:12.192 --> 00:09:22.742
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be
self-contented.

00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:33.372
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western
life is to see and to be seen.

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:44.382
Both things were missing completely in the
incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:09:44.382 --> 00:09:49.822
So when I say these things, suddenly people
start thinking, “Let us become hippies,

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:55.052
or let them become punks, or let us become
this, let us become that.”

00:09:55.052 --> 00:09:56.992
You don’t have to become anything.

00:09:56.992 --> 00:10:04.202
Whatever you have – your body, your face,
your hair – everything is there, just meant

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:09.432
for you.

00:10:09.432 --> 00:10:24.062
You don’t have to change anything outwardly
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:30.202
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

00:10:30.202 --> 00:10:45.312
Though there were so many clouds on His being,
though many people insulted Him, tortured

00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:55.292
Him, hanged Him, crucified Him, still the
Eternal Being didn’t bother.

00:10:55.292 --> 00:11:08.792
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja
Yogi is to accept, go on accepting things.

00:11:08.792 --> 00:11:13.972
But when I say accept, I must say the other
side also: that doesn’t mean you start accepting

00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:18.652
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

00:11:18.652 --> 00:11:24.832
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

00:11:24.832 --> 00:11:26.152
“What’s wrong?

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:28.882
You have said it already.”

00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:33.302
Whatever I say has another side, always.

00:11:33.302 --> 00:11:37.502
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.”

00:11:37.502 --> 00:11:41.242
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:57.902
Like this, you see, we go on diverting ourselves,
deviating ourselves from reality just to cheat

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.062
ourselves.

00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:05.232
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

00:12:05.232 --> 00:12:11.612
We have no wisdom because we do not know what
is for our benevolence, what is for our good,

00:12:11.612 --> 00:12:13.182
what we should do for our good.

00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:17.112
I mean even if we know, we don’t want to
do it.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:20.402
So, what we lack is wisdom.

00:12:20.402 --> 00:12:25.831
That’s a vicious circle, I must say, that
Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:36.362
– He is the giver of wisdom, He is the giver
of wisdom – and He has to give you the wisdom,

00:12:36.362 --> 00:12:41.512
He is to be awakened; but you are not wise
because He is not awakened.

00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:47.281
It’s a very vicious circle.

00:12:47.281 --> 00:12:50.822
How to make this vicious circle break?

00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:57.252
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

00:12:57.252 --> 00:13:06.142
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

00:13:06.142 --> 00:13:11.882
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

00:13:11.882 --> 00:13:21.472
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:33.312
That’s the point where you could see yourself
– introspection, which I have seen among

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:37.612
Russians.

00:13:37.612 --> 00:13:41.922
Just introspect: “Why do I do like that?

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:45.031
Why cannot I meditate?

00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:50.832
Am I going to miss out?

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:59.252
Why can I not do something that is good for
me?”

00:13:59.252 --> 00:14:09.392
Introspection is the only way you can see
yourself how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

00:14:09.392 --> 00:14:21.252
Even, I have seen, when I say something in
general, people always – the mind is very

00:14:21.252 --> 00:14:26.832
clever – thinks that I am talking about
somebody else, not about them.

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:35.552
It’s a convex mind, convex, which never
receives anything inside itself because there

00:14:35.552 --> 00:14:40.952
is no wisdom.

00:14:40.952 --> 00:14:51.502
If you are wise, then not only that you’ll
accept but you’ll understand and it will

00:14:51.502 --> 00:14:57.342
penetrate into your attention through your
central nervous system.

00:14:57.342 --> 00:15:00.982
You just know that this is it.

00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:08.803
Now you know that this… you put your hand
towards this candle, it… you’ll… your

00:15:08.803 --> 00:15:09.932
fingers might burn.

00:15:09.932 --> 00:15:15.892
You know it definitely, with experience, and
you won’t do that.

00:15:15.892 --> 00:15:24.302
With experience you have learnt not to put
your hand on to the candle.

00:15:24.302 --> 00:15:29.972
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to
tell you that.

00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:33.872
But this is a new life you have started – a
spiritual life.

00:15:33.872 --> 00:15:42.672
When you are going into the spiritual life,
try to remember your experiences, one after

00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:48.232
another: how you got transformed, how you
changed, how many the bad things that you

00:15:48.232 --> 00:15:53.252
had disappeared gradually and how you have
become so nice.

00:15:53.252 --> 00:16:01.972
This will take away your depression – to
begin with.

00:16:01.972 --> 00:16:06.382
Then you should think that, “What do I have
to do further?

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.642
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

00:16:07.642 --> 00:16:17.792
There are lots of stages between absolute
stupidity and absolute wisdom, and you see

00:16:17.792 --> 00:16:28.432
all those shades all over, and combinations
and permutations of these I see every day.

00:16:28.432 --> 00:16:40.022
And I am surprised that after getting your
Self Realization, when Shri Ganesha is shining

00:16:40.022 --> 00:16:48.262
in your attention, you should see your reflection
clearly and try to correct it.

00:16:48.262 --> 00:16:57.262
Only this much wisdom if you have that, “I
have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll

00:16:57.262 --> 00:17:00.341
do it.

00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:06.531
I know of somebody who would never get up
in the mornings, say for example.

00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:11.972
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock
in the morning – I was surprised.

00:17:11.972 --> 00:17:17.451
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready

00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:19.152
to go somewhere.

00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:23.282
I said, “Where are you going?”

00:17:23.282 --> 00:17:25.682
“You don’t know?”

00:17:25.682 --> 00:17:26.682
I said, “What?”

00:17:26.682 --> 00:17:33.591
“I have got a job now and I have to be present
at 8 o’clock and it will take two hours

00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:34.792
to reach that place.

00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:36.811
Also, I am keeping some margin.

00:17:36.811 --> 00:17:38.352
So I have to leave now.

00:17:38.352 --> 00:17:40.502
I can’t talk to You even.”

00:17:40.502 --> 00:17:45.112
Quite alert, awake.

00:17:45.112 --> 00:17:54.742
Now, what is the thing is as far as money
is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

00:17:54.742 --> 00:18:02.592
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

00:18:02.592 --> 00:18:13.722
Money wisdom is quite a lot, job wisdom is
quite a lot.

00:18:13.722 --> 00:18:25.892
Because these things means prestige in the
society, this means security in the society.

00:18:25.892 --> 00:18:32.272
So this kind of business you find in many
people and in some even that is missing.

00:18:32.272 --> 00:18:37.692
They don’t even understand that they have
to earn their living.

00:18:37.692 --> 00:18:47.612
But that’s the minimum, you cannot be parasite.

00:18:47.612 --> 00:18:53.852
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages,
is this: that we are not for money, money

00:18:53.852 --> 00:19:03.492
is for us.

00:19:03.492 --> 00:19:16.272
The attention if it is on your Spirit, on
the Ganesha Principle, then whole situation

00:19:16.272 --> 00:19:19.082
will change.

00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:24.702
Your priorities will change.

00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:28.932
And suddenly people will say, “Mother, what
has happened to this gentleman?

00:19:28.932 --> 00:19:40.482
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such
a wise person.”

00:19:40.482 --> 00:19:45.482
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have
minimum wisdom already there.

00:19:45.482 --> 00:19:50.012
I mean, even if that is not there, how can
you work it out?

00:19:50.012 --> 00:19:58.962
Is not meant for stupid people, Moodhas, not
meant for Moodh.

00:19:58.962 --> 00:20:01.932
So now what is our benevolence is?

00:20:01.932 --> 00:20:06.932
Let us see.

00:20:06.932 --> 00:20:08.762
Is it money?

00:20:08.762 --> 00:20:10.352
No.

00:20:10.352 --> 00:20:18.232
Those who have money don’t seem to be very
happy people always.

00:20:18.232 --> 00:20:19.902
Then what is the next, is jobs?

00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:25.232
Those who have jobs – all right, should
have jobs, I am not saying you should be jobless.

00:20:25.232 --> 00:20:32.772
I mean immediately the another side they will
take, I mean so quick you know, that, “Mother

00:20:32.772 --> 00:20:40.762
is saying we can be jobless you see, nice.”

00:20:40.762 --> 00:20:42.542
Immediate, escapes.

00:20:42.542 --> 00:20:50.402
Now, then the power: you want to have political
power, this social power, this power, that

00:20:50.402 --> 00:20:57.222
power – is absolutely a joyless pursuit.

00:20:57.222 --> 00:21:05.212
You go and see those people who are supposed
to be powerful, so called, half way they are

00:21:05.212 --> 00:21:15.801
towards hell, one foot there and one foot
here and about to be gulped down by the crocodiles.

00:21:15.801 --> 00:21:21.921
You can see it clearly.

00:21:21.921 --> 00:21:28.051
Specially in this Kali Yuga it’s so obvious,
so clear-cut.

00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:36.252
We don’t want to be like them, we want to
be like Shri Ganesh.

00:21:36.252 --> 00:21:42.272
So once you start accepting your circumstances,
accepting your body, your… accepting your

00:21:42.272 --> 00:22:00.431
face, everything, you will see that lot of
time will be saved.

00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:10.772
Another problem that faces us is planning.

00:22:10.772 --> 00:22:14.192
And that is missing in Shri Ganesha completely.

00:22:14.192 --> 00:22:16.802
He did not do any planning whatsoever.

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:24.002
I wish He had done some planning, things would
have been much better.

00:22:24.002 --> 00:22:30.752
He doesn’t believe in planning because He
is so powerful.

00:22:30.752 --> 00:22:35.212
Whatever He wants, He can get it done.

00:22:35.212 --> 00:22:36.212
You want the sun?

00:22:36.212 --> 00:22:38.292
All right the sun is there.

00:22:38.292 --> 00:22:39.292
You want the moon?

00:22:39.292 --> 00:22:40.292
Moon is there.

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:41.292
You want the stars?

00:22:41.292 --> 00:22:42.292
Stars is there.

00:22:42.292 --> 00:22:53.782
The
dust of His feet can create the whole universe

00:22:53.782 --> 00:22:59.472
– universes after universes.

00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:11.472
For such a person, there is no need to be
planning everything because whatever He wants

00:23:11.472 --> 00:23:14.482
happens.

00:23:14.482 --> 00:23:17.532
But why, why it happens?

00:23:17.532 --> 00:23:22.242
Why He has this power?

00:23:22.242 --> 00:23:26.561
Because He is in that state.

00:23:26.561 --> 00:23:35.072
Are you in that state?

00:23:35.072 --> 00:23:38.042
You have not achieved that state.

00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:48.752
You talk somebody… tell somebody that, “Oh
my, I have to go and catch the plane.”

00:23:48.752 --> 00:23:54.152
There are ten people standing next to you,
they’ll all get panicky.

00:23:54.152 --> 00:24:01.301
I have to go, and they are bothered; something
sort of goes off their heads.

00:24:01.301 --> 00:24:05.181
I don’t know what goes, they go amuck.

00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:06.632
I never tell them like that.

00:24:06.632 --> 00:24:12.062
I say, “There’s still time for the plane
to go, and don’t worry.

00:24:12.062 --> 00:24:20.912
When I reach there then the plane will leave
so you don’t worry.”

00:24:20.912 --> 00:24:34.222
But because of this kind of a… presumptions,
and the planning system of the mind, you just

00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:39.222
think that, “Now I have a plan to go today,
I must go.”

00:24:39.222 --> 00:24:40.222
Why?

00:24:40.222 --> 00:24:42.512
I won’t go.

00:24:42.512 --> 00:24:45.102
I may decide at the last minute I don’t
want to go.

00:24:45.102 --> 00:24:47.552
I’ll make the plane go away.

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:52.602
We did that many a times, you know very well.

00:24:52.602 --> 00:25:00.412
I wanted to buy the Rome Ashram, so I saw
to it that the plane never arrived.

00:25:00.412 --> 00:25:05.412
But you have to be in that state.

00:25:05.412 --> 00:25:08.642
Specially buying this Cabella, you know what
happened.

00:25:08.642 --> 00:25:16.712
There were five great intellectuals on My
head sitting.

00:25:16.712 --> 00:25:21.602
I didn’t know how I will manage these five
intellectuals with all their planning, this,

00:25:21.602 --> 00:25:30.982
that; they made Me run up and down, do this
and that, Ultimately they all had to come

00:25:30.982 --> 00:25:32.992
here.

00:25:32.992 --> 00:25:35.032
But I was telling them, “Go and have a look.”

00:25:35.032 --> 00:25:46.532
Nobody would look at it, nobody would listen
to Me, nobody wanted to know about it.

00:25:46.532 --> 00:25:59.532
How things work out – is your pure desire
that can work out anything that you want.

00:25:59.532 --> 00:26:03.452
But you won’t want funny things also.

00:26:03.452 --> 00:26:08.442
Like Shri Ganesha would not like to follow
some entrepreneur who is saying, “Have a

00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:12.171
punk on your head”, or something.

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:16.602
Is stupidity, all kinds of stupidities.

00:26:16.602 --> 00:26:22.752
Because you are stupid, these entrepreneurs
are having a good time; they can befool us

00:26:22.752 --> 00:26:25.342
all the time.

00:26:25.342 --> 00:26:37.682
At His state, He is Himself, on top of the
pure desire.

00:26:37.682 --> 00:26:43.642
The pure desire is on His stomach, tied up
nicely.

00:26:43.642 --> 00:27:01.032
It is to be seen in Sahaja Yoga how things
work out, how miraculously they work out,

00:27:01.032 --> 00:27:03.452
and these can happen to you also.

00:27:03.452 --> 00:27:10.082
All these Powers can come to you also.

00:27:10.082 --> 00:27:15.342
You know about some people who came to us
who didn’t know even how to sing.

00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:19.662
I mean, they had no voices; something very
funny they had – I mean I didn’t know

00:27:19.662 --> 00:27:25.291
from where they learnt to even talk.

00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:30.902
When they opened their mouths, if you were
at one note, they were on another note and

00:27:30.902 --> 00:27:36.472
they went on and on and on without even listening
to what they were singing.

00:27:36.472 --> 00:27:44.542
After some time, I find they are singing beautifully.

00:27:44.542 --> 00:27:49.342
So the Kundalini itself is working it out,
the pure desire is working it out, but what

00:27:49.342 --> 00:27:50.872
about you?

00:27:50.872 --> 00:27:57.192
What are you doing about it is to be seen.

00:27:57.192 --> 00:28:10.732
There are so many things that could be understood
very easily through the lifestyle of Shri

00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:11.742
Ganesha.

00:28:11.742 --> 00:28:26.301
The first and foremost thing for Him is to
obey His Mother – never to say no, no question,

00:28:26.301 --> 00:28:35.472
and also not to ask why.

00:28:35.472 --> 00:28:43.622
He will go and fight with all the Gods and
Goddesses and every one.

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:50.752
And that’s what Christ has said, “Anything
against Me I’ve tolerated but nothing against

00:28:50.752 --> 00:28:55.411
the Holy Ghost.”

00:28:55.411 --> 00:29:10.102
There should be no question, there should
be no explanation.

00:29:10.102 --> 00:29:19.482
Sometimes even My patience goes out, the way
they do not want to accept what I am telling

00:29:19.482 --> 00:29:20.482
them.

00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:25.532
At the end of course they all come around,
no doubt – at the end.

00:29:25.532 --> 00:29:28.892
But you waste so much time convincing them.

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:32.152
What is the reason?

00:29:32.152 --> 00:29:35.932
They have no wisdom to know what their Mother
is.

00:29:35.932 --> 00:29:45.152
Like, you know the story of Shri Ganesha that
His Mother said, “The one who goes round

00:29:45.152 --> 00:29:51.041
the Mother Earth, I will give you a present.”

00:29:51.041 --> 00:30:02.161
So, Ganesha again accepts a little mouse as
a transport – imagine.

00:30:02.161 --> 00:30:08.632
Nowadays people can’t believe it that Shri
Ganesha, so powerful, should accept just a

00:30:08.632 --> 00:30:11.102
mouse for His transport.

00:30:11.102 --> 00:30:22.852
Because He’s so humble; he doesn’t have
to show off His Lincoln or Mercedes to anyone;

00:30:22.852 --> 00:30:29.112
He is very comfortable with His mouse.

00:30:29.112 --> 00:30:32.402
Now what does He do?

00:30:32.402 --> 00:30:35.392
He thinks that…

00:30:35.392 --> 00:30:42.292
He understands, in no time, that His Mother
is much greater than the Mother Earth.

00:30:42.292 --> 00:30:46.811
“So why should I go round the Mother Earth?”

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:54.252
His brother is going round on a peacock.

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:59.462
He just goes round His Mother – He gets
the present.

00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:14.022
It’s such a simple thing to understand because
He is the wisest person.

00:31:14.022 --> 00:31:30.672
The wisest person knows what is what, he knows
who is who, he knows what are the qualities

00:31:30.672 --> 00:31:32.782
of these persons.

00:31:32.782 --> 00:31:43.712
He is not impressed by superficial things,
no.

00:31:43.712 --> 00:31:51.842
If somebody is well dressed, then people get
very much impressed by them, and they turn

00:31:51.842 --> 00:32:05.082
out to be bank robbers – walking with umbrellas
and with lined suits, as if some big executives

00:32:05.082 --> 00:32:15.472
are coming, and they decamp with all the loot.

00:32:15.472 --> 00:32:27.882
So for a wise person, the superficial behavior
doesn’t appeal, not bothered.

00:32:27.882 --> 00:32:43.531
It is a kind of a very penetrating intelligence;
just like a computer you know.

00:32:43.531 --> 00:32:45.872
In a second you know that what is this gentleman.

00:32:45.872 --> 00:32:53.051
Oh, he may come with a great, you see, ado
and he might come and praise you and do this

00:32:53.051 --> 00:33:02.612
and do that and you know the person very well.

00:33:02.612 --> 00:33:13.442
If some body is unduly very friendly, very
kind, very nice, not necessarily that he is

00:33:13.442 --> 00:33:24.051
really appreciating you but he is looking
at your purse, maybe, maybe something else.

00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:33.561
But not only on this level, it is even on
a spiritual level we have to understand how

00:33:33.561 --> 00:33:45.592
people try to put you down spiritually; what
they try, what tricks they try on you.

00:33:45.592 --> 00:33:53.632
It could be your husband, your wife, your
children, your relations, your friends, anybody,

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:55.702
any Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:58.722
But in the case of Shri Ganesha, it’s the
other way round.

00:33:58.722 --> 00:34:05.122
They say that if you put one apple, bad apple,
all the apples get spoilt.

00:34:05.122 --> 00:34:16.402
But if you put Shri Ganesha among all the
bad apples, they’ll get all right.

00:34:16.402 --> 00:34:21.382
Because He’s the life-giving force.

00:34:21.382 --> 00:34:37.372
This is one of the greatest qualities, that
He knows that He is the source of life and

00:34:37.372 --> 00:34:40.772
He gives life, He gives Chaitanya.

00:34:40.772 --> 00:34:49.052
He doesn’t say… think that, “Now supposing
I give Chaitanya, give life to this person,

00:34:49.052 --> 00:34:52.462
my ego will come up,” – very common problem.

00:34:52.462 --> 00:34:59.552
“Mother I don’t want to do it because
my ego will come up.”

00:34:59.552 --> 00:35:03.621
Everybody is psychoanalyzing themselves ‘because
this will happen’ – Baba!

00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:05.502
[- Hindi expression of a general exclamatory
nature –ed.]

00:35:05.502 --> 00:35:10.212
You are all realized souls now, you are all
saints.

00:35:10.212 --> 00:35:16.412
The false people are talking so big, and you
the people who have got something are still

00:35:16.412 --> 00:35:19.752
thinking, “My ego will come up, this will
happen.”

00:35:19.752 --> 00:35:25.632
No, no, you have the powers.

00:35:25.632 --> 00:35:36.452
But as you keep it under a manger, as Christ
has said, the light will go out.

00:35:36.452 --> 00:35:48.371
You have to give it to others, you have to
open it out.

00:35:48.371 --> 00:35:50.452
And that is how you will judge your state.

00:35:50.452 --> 00:35:53.102
“What is my state?

00:35:53.102 --> 00:35:55.172
Let’s see.

00:35:55.172 --> 00:35:58.262
Where am I?”

00:35:58.262 --> 00:36:05.752
That confidence, take it from Me, should be
with you.

00:36:05.752 --> 00:36:11.292
All of you have to work out this way.

00:36:11.292 --> 00:36:13.272
Very many…

00:36:13.272 --> 00:36:15.542
“Mother, my Mooladhara is caught up.”

00:36:15.542 --> 00:36:19.422
How dare anybody catch Mooladhar?

00:36:19.422 --> 00:36:23.472
That’s the anger of Shri Ganesha.

00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:26.762
How dare?

00:36:26.762 --> 00:36:30.371
How can anybody?

00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:39.172
What’s missing is complete faith in yourself
and faith in your Mother.

00:36:39.172 --> 00:36:47.152
In Russia recently… in Prague, there was
a lady who was brought on the stage, very

00:36:47.152 --> 00:36:48.352
old lady, couldn’t walk.

00:36:48.352 --> 00:36:54.621
I mean they just carried her and she came
and sat before Me on a chair.

00:36:54.621 --> 00:36:56.882
She said, “I know You…

00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:58.232
I’ll be cured.

00:36:58.232 --> 00:37:02.142
I am in Your presence; I know I will be cured.”

00:37:02.142 --> 00:37:03.262
I said, “Then get up.”

00:37:03.262 --> 00:37:04.492
She got up.

00:37:04.492 --> 00:37:09.032
Those who were with Me in Prague, you can
ask them.

00:37:09.032 --> 00:37:15.371
She came down and she started running, and
everybody laughed.

00:37:15.371 --> 00:37:28.052
But her faith – she was not a Sahaja Yogini
as such – but she was sure; she knew Me.

00:37:28.052 --> 00:37:32.162
And she just started running like that and
everybody started looking at her.

00:37:32.162 --> 00:37:40.862
Same thing happened in Russia for many people
– very serious diseases.

00:37:40.862 --> 00:37:49.861
So that, one thing is for sure, either you
don’t know that you are realized souls or

00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:54.132
else you don’t know Me, one of the two things.

00:37:54.132 --> 00:37:57.142
Why was He so obedient to His Mother?

00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:58.812
Why was He?

00:37:58.812 --> 00:38:00.592
Because that was the wisest thing to do.

00:38:00.592 --> 00:38:12.812
The one who knows everything, it’s better
to be guided by that person.

00:38:12.812 --> 00:38:17.192
And many a times I have seen, people try to
do things without telling Me, important things

00:38:17.192 --> 00:38:20.061
– they fall into traps.

00:38:20.061 --> 00:38:27.302
Then they come back to Me and I tell them
the solution, it works.

00:38:27.302 --> 00:38:32.862
It’s not necessary that you should tell
Me everything.

00:38:32.862 --> 00:38:43.942
But when you are in a fix, you can always
just go into yourself and ask yourself, “What

00:38:43.942 --> 00:38:44.972
would Mother do?”

00:38:44.972 --> 00:38:47.912
You’ll get the answer.

00:38:47.912 --> 00:38:50.262
You are at a… quite a higher state.

00:38:50.262 --> 00:38:55.682
But still, even if you are on a tree and you
are still thinking you are falling down, you

00:38:55.682 --> 00:38:57.932
are nowhere.

00:38:57.932 --> 00:39:00.182
Steady yourself.

00:39:00.182 --> 00:39:10.022
That’s what is, we say, the Adhishthan of
Shri Ganesha.

00:39:10.022 --> 00:39:18.732
Is the steadiness, steadiness in your achievements
of Sahaj Yog.

00:39:18.732 --> 00:39:26.572
Believing in yourself that you have entered
into the new world, into the new atmosphere

00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:30.382
[UNCLEAR] it out.

00:39:30.382 --> 00:39:37.562
Shri Ganesha is just waiting.

00:39:37.562 --> 00:39:41.452
But He is not meant for people who have no
courage.

00:39:41.452 --> 00:39:58.435
Such a courageous man who could go and fight
with all the Devas, because He knew the Shakti

00:39:58.435 --> 00:40:05.042
was with Him.

00:40:05.042 --> 00:40:14.402
Today is such a joyous day for Me because
we have children, and we are dealing with

00:40:14.402 --> 00:40:15.402
children.

00:40:15.402 --> 00:40:17.402
Most of them are born realized.

00:40:17.402 --> 00:40:28.402
They are of a very special category, I have
told you many a times, but we spoil them;

00:40:28.402 --> 00:40:36.512
because we were not born realized, so we don’t
know how to handle these children, we spoil

00:40:36.512 --> 00:40:37.512
them.

00:40:37.512 --> 00:40:43.042
Not only we spoil them, but we interfere with
the school, we interfere with this as if we

00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:53.162
are the wisest parents ever living.

00:40:53.162 --> 00:40:59.672
Because we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to be
much more sensible than other parents.

00:40:59.672 --> 00:41:03.182
How can you interfere with any school anywhere?

00:41:03.182 --> 00:41:11.202
But in Sahaja Yoga you will.

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:21.432
It is because there is no wisdom and no understanding
what is good and benevolent for your child.

00:41:21.432 --> 00:41:26.402
If you love your child, then you must think
of its benevolent.

00:41:26.402 --> 00:41:33.292
You must learn from the experience what happens
to children if they are left like that.

00:41:33.292 --> 00:41:40.442
You cannot spoil your child, you cannot because
it’s a special category of children they

00:41:40.442 --> 00:41:41.442
are.

00:41:41.442 --> 00:41:52.782
They are not children who can become vagabonds;
they cannot become thieves.

00:41:52.782 --> 00:42:00.472
So you will make them something funny – they
are neither here nor there.

00:42:00.472 --> 00:42:09.072
They are born realized and they have to be
channelized properly, to achieve their complete

00:42:09.072 --> 00:42:16.902
manifestation of their Spirit.

00:42:16.902 --> 00:42:27.081
So the possessiveness and the stupid attachments
to children must be given up.

00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:32.912
There is no force on you – if you want to
destroy a child, you can destroy.

00:42:32.912 --> 00:42:39.562
But in an advice – if you were Ganeshas,
you would have understood it, I don’t have

00:42:39.562 --> 00:42:43.752
to explain so much.

00:42:43.752 --> 00:42:51.412
What is good for your child, because we have
to have beautiful children.

00:42:51.412 --> 00:42:53.702
They are born beautiful children, I tell you.

00:42:53.702 --> 00:42:58.432
If they are spoilt, it is because of you,
you have spoilt them.

00:42:58.432 --> 00:43:00.852
You have ruined them.

00:43:00.852 --> 00:43:03.412
You are responsible.

00:43:03.412 --> 00:43:11.312
I know of so many children – they’re very,
very sweet.

00:43:11.312 --> 00:43:19.012
I have conference with them also and I find
them much more congenial; I have much better

00:43:19.012 --> 00:43:24.172
rapport with them than I can have with you.

00:43:24.172 --> 00:43:27.252
They never argue, never.

00:43:27.252 --> 00:43:38.101
They never says no, and they have very good
information about all of you.

00:43:38.101 --> 00:43:45.042
So it is such a nice thing that today you
should desire that our children should very

00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:55.892
soon become the images of Shri Ganesha, His
Ganas, who have to work out so much.

00:43:55.892 --> 00:43:59.172
It’s a tremendous task.

00:43:59.172 --> 00:44:07.152
Sahaja Yoga is the greatest achievement of
Spiritual evolution.

00:44:07.152 --> 00:44:11.752
We all have to dedicate ourselves.

00:44:11.752 --> 00:44:17.722
We don’t have to sacrifice anything as the
Saints have sacrificed – nothing, don’t

00:44:17.722 --> 00:44:19.302
have to suffer anything.

00:44:19.302 --> 00:44:22.202
Only thing you have to have – wisdom.

00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:28.621
For that, I am very happy that today we are
worshipping Shri Ganesha.

00:44:28.621 --> 00:44:37.322
So the pure desire should be that, “Shri
Ganesha please give us Divine Wisdom.”

00:44:37.322 --> 00:44:39.302
That’s all.

00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:40.772
It contains everything in it.

00:44:40.772 --> 00:44:41.772
May God bless you.
