00:02.200 --> 00:10.110
Today somebody came from India and told me
that, “You better change the name Sahaja

00:10.110 --> 00:11.740
Yoga into some other name.

00:11.740 --> 00:14.240
So I said, “What about Maha Yoga?”

00:14.240 --> 00:17.160
And he liked it very much.

00:17.160 --> 00:26.030
He said, “Now people are taking Sahaj Yoga
as their own and they are using it for their

00:26.030 --> 00:27.030
own purpose."

00:27.030 --> 00:29.160
I said, “Very good idea.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.730
If they are using it, is even better!

00:32.730 --> 00:40.460
Because the word itself suggests that this
union has to be spontaneous.

00:40.460 --> 00:42.850
They have to give a spontaneous union.

00:42.850 --> 00:46.090
If they claim it, they have to do it.

00:46.090 --> 00:49.520
If they are not doing it, then it is wrong.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.660
It’s very simple!”

00:50.660 --> 01:02.470
But he said, “In any case Sahaj Yoga does
not denote the dimension which it has reached:

01:02.470 --> 01:05.990
that people are getting en-masse Realisation."

01:05.990 --> 01:13.899
Moreover he said that people don’t understand
that the time has come for thousands of people

01:13.899 --> 01:15.740
to get their Realisation.

01:15.740 --> 01:23.350
Perhaps we are not aware [of] what time we
are born.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.939
So many people are seeking God.

01:26.939 --> 01:36.880
Never in the history before there was such
a multitude which was seriously seeking God,

01:36.880 --> 01:41.469
and honestly wanting to get their union.

01:41.469 --> 01:50.459
Only in the modern times you find they are
very honest, very sincere; and they are born

01:50.459 --> 01:51.459
seekers.

01:51.459 --> 01:56.829
I mean their quality is that they are seekers;
their temperament is that they are seekers.

01:56.829 --> 02:04.060
They are not satisfied with anything else
but seeking.

02:04.060 --> 02:05.319
Why this is happening?

02:05.319 --> 02:09.700
We have to think about it.

02:09.700 --> 02:13.680
Why people are not satisfied with what they
have?

02:13.680 --> 02:23.819
Why are they not seeking now the materialism
or the powers which are other than the Divine

02:23.819 --> 02:24.819
Power?

02:24.819 --> 02:30.569
Why do they want that they should know their
Spirit?

02:30.569 --> 02:31.670
What is the reason?

02:31.670 --> 02:35.280
Why such an upsurge?

02:35.280 --> 02:42.230
And why people, like mad, are following anyone
who comes across?

02:42.230 --> 02:49.060
To try every method and experiment with everything
to get that bliss and joy.

02:49.060 --> 02:57.340
You know [that], from ancient times, people
have been talking about your rebirth.

02:57.340 --> 03:06.329
Even at the time of Rama, one disciple called
as Nachiketa, went to the father-in-law of

03:06.329 --> 03:13.480
Rama, whose name was Raja Janaka, and asked
Him that, “Give me Self-knowledge."

03:13.480 --> 03:23.560
And Nachiketa was very, very anxious, very
much wanting to be the Spirit.

03:23.560 --> 03:29.549
But Janaka put him to many, many tests.

03:29.549 --> 03:34.010
And the conversation between them is very
interesting.

03:34.010 --> 03:39.879
So one individual is mentioned in those days
— I mean that’s a long time back, Rama’s

03:39.879 --> 03:44.079
time — who was seeking.

03:44.079 --> 03:54.400
Even at the time of Christ there was, we would
say, John the Baptist who talked of baptism.

03:54.400 --> 04:04.200
But as far as seeking is concerned, in the
multitude, there was no such urge, there was

04:04.200 --> 04:08.989
not that seeking as you find today.

04:08.989 --> 04:12.480
So there must be something in the atmosphere.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.670
Then another thing is that we are trying to
save time.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.290
We must have watches.

04:19.290 --> 04:22.630
We must see that [watch] after every ten minutes.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.490
Oh, we have to save time.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.490
We cannot waste time.

04:25.490 --> 04:30.310
I mean, supposing somebody has to go to India,
then a date is fixed, and then he must go

04:30.310 --> 04:31.960
by that plane, particular plane.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.500
If that plane is missed, he thinks he’s
lost the world!

04:35.500 --> 04:39.840
Time-saving is another urge within us.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.110
Why do we want to save time?

04:44.110 --> 04:49.390
Why this urge from the unconscious is so strong
that we must save time?

04:49.390 --> 04:52.330
Is there something going wrong or something
is going to happen?

04:52.330 --> 04:57.470
Or is there some urgency or emergency which
you feel in the time itself?

04:57.470 --> 05:02.540
Because, in the olden times, nobody used to
worry so much about time.

05:02.540 --> 05:06.200
So what is the reason for this kind of time-saving
today?

05:06.200 --> 05:13.650
We can see very clearly that there are genuine
seekers.

05:13.650 --> 05:16.471
There are seekers because of the faction around.

05:16.471 --> 05:24.260
And there are people who do not seek; who
are quite satisfied with whatever mundane

05:24.260 --> 05:30.380
life they are leading, or whatever ambitions
they have other than seeking.

05:30.380 --> 05:39.710
But the genuine seekers are so many in number
that we have to find out why this genuine

05:39.710 --> 05:41.960
seeking is working so much.

05:41.960 --> 05:48.770
And you are so restless about it, so anxious
that, without the seeking, you are not satisfied.

05:48.770 --> 05:55.600
You are willing to give up everything that
is on this Earth with you, or whatever is

05:55.600 --> 05:59.130
your own so-called possessions, but you want
to seek yourself.

05:59.130 --> 06:02.190
That’s a fact; it’s absolutely honest.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.740
There’s no doubt about it.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.270
But why there is seeking?

06:08.270 --> 06:14.290
It is because the Last Judgment has started.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.210
The Last Judgment has started now.

06:16.210 --> 06:21.320
Many great souls are taking birth.

06:21.320 --> 06:29.060
It is very common these days, you talk to
anyone about his child [and] they will tell

06:29.060 --> 06:36.350
two things: Either he is a grand old man,
some ancient figure born in the family and

06:36.350 --> 06:39.520
every word he speaks is wisdom.

06:39.520 --> 06:46.780
Or the other thing they may tell you is that
he’s a monster, he’s good for nothing,

06:46.780 --> 06:48.240
he is useless.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.060
Nothing in between!

06:52.060 --> 06:54.680
Now this happening also was very uncommon.

06:54.680 --> 07:02.660
Now we have seen, so many of you, who are
Sahaj Yogis, that so many children are born-realised.

07:02.660 --> 07:07.610
I mean, when I was born, I found very, very
few people.

07:07.610 --> 07:11.160
Except for my father I couldn’t find anyone
who was born-realised.

07:11.160 --> 07:19.470
And there were many fakirs and saints, who
came to our house, or we went to see them,

07:19.470 --> 07:21.470
and I found that their Kundalini was all frozen.

07:21.470 --> 07:24.810
They may be calling themselves saints or whatever
it is.

07:24.810 --> 07:31.430
But I was amazed that there was no companionship
with them because you couldn’t talk [to

07:31.430 --> 07:32.430
them].

07:32.430 --> 07:36.500
They were at a very low level of evolution
and they were just trying to make money or

07:36.500 --> 07:42.630
give some sort of technique or some sort of
a blah, blah, blah.

07:42.630 --> 07:46.150
Even then it was so.

07:46.150 --> 07:53.420
But innately in a country like India people
know what to seek, what to find.

07:53.420 --> 08:03.840
Now, because of your righteous life in previous
births, I believe, maybe, or whatever it is:

08:03.840 --> 08:11.560
as a blessing of that you are born in these
countries where there is affluence, where

08:11.560 --> 08:17.180
your attention does not go to material things
so much, but to higher things.

08:17.180 --> 08:22.150
And then you start thinking that all this
is a waste, a junk and we are not going to

08:22.150 --> 08:24.200
carry the junk of our parents on our heads.

08:24.200 --> 08:30.600
Some sort of feeling crawls up and you start
seeking.

08:30.600 --> 08:38.900
In England I don’t know how many children
I have seen who are born-realised, of a very

08:38.900 --> 08:39.900
high quality.

08:39.900 --> 08:44.460
Such great souls are taking birth on this
Earth.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.570
Why?

08:46.570 --> 08:48.030
It never happened before.

08:48.030 --> 08:55.740
And within these ten years’ time, such a
tremendous in-flow of these great souls is

08:55.740 --> 09:02.900
felt that one has to realise that there is
a kind of an emergency.

09:02.900 --> 09:12.050
This emergency is felt also even in those
people who are not yet seeking.

09:12.050 --> 09:17.580
They are so speedy; they are so anxious; they
get into stress and they get into tensions.

09:17.580 --> 09:21.860
If you ask your forefathers who had gone out
to wars: they never had tensions.

09:21.860 --> 09:25.730
They would kill ten people and sleep off nicely
without thinking about it.

09:25.730 --> 09:31.530
They didn’t even have the sensitivity that
you have, that compassion and that understanding.

09:31.530 --> 09:40.030
With this growth within, or we can say, with
this urge within, also there are many things

09:40.030 --> 09:47.950
that have happened outside that you can see
very clearly: is that a consciousness has

09:47.950 --> 10:02.670
come, a collective awareness has come, as
to the idea of cruelty, wars and also domination

10:02.670 --> 10:05.400
of other people.

10:05.400 --> 10:10.141
Perhaps none of you could be as old as I am
here.

10:10.141 --> 10:12.360
I have seen this working out.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.150
People are so much changed in their ideas.

10:14.150 --> 10:21.090
There’s such a revolution that you cannot
think [of] a person like Christ, today to

10:21.090 --> 10:23.440
be born and to be crucified.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.160
Of course you may misunderstand.

10:25.160 --> 10:30.880
You may not like Him because He’s a carpenter’s
son, He’s too simple, He talks of spontaneity;

10:30.880 --> 10:33.460
He doesn’t give you any technique; He doesn’t
take any money from you; He doesn’t organise.

10:33.460 --> 10:40.620
You may not like Him, and you may deny Him
also thinking that He’s just useless, but

10:40.620 --> 10:43.610
you cannot crucify [Him].

10:43.610 --> 10:47.360
Under any law you cannot do it.

10:47.360 --> 10:52.750
Imagine what a development of society has
also taken place!

10:52.750 --> 10:54.400
And we understand what is wrong.

10:54.400 --> 10:59.760
For example now, Afghanistan was invaded:
everybody, everyone in the whole world, was

10:59.760 --> 11:02.940
feeling that it was wrong.

11:02.940 --> 11:11.190
When one of the satellites was falling, and
there were some astronauts caught up in that,

11:11.190 --> 11:12.430
the whole world was watching.

11:12.430 --> 11:17.670
I mean, they were not Indians and they were
not Egyptians, but everywhere people were

11:17.670 --> 11:19.980
watching that they should come down safely.

11:19.980 --> 11:25.900
Everybody was praying in their own way that,
“Oh God, they must be safe!”

11:25.900 --> 11:31.740
Because of the development outside we are
so much connected with each other: there’s

11:31.740 --> 11:36.740
such an articulation of our thoughts and our
ideas and our feelings and our sensitivities

11:36.740 --> 11:44.360
that, anything happens in any part of our
country, we do feel, in any part of the world,

11:44.360 --> 11:48.670
we feel; anywhere anything happens to someone,
we feel it.

11:48.670 --> 11:52.680
So our collectivity has also become sharper
and sensitive.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.580
It’s a remarkable time we are born in.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.330
You are very fortunate and lucky people.

11:58.330 --> 12:04.080
And your age group specially is specially
blessed because, at this time, you are well-read,

12:04.080 --> 12:10.080
you know all about it and you are just there
to understand and get it.

12:10.080 --> 12:19.870
But, as I said, that, in a country like India
where, from ancient times, there has been

12:19.870 --> 12:29.250
a big search within, much more known to them
were the truths of life.

12:29.250 --> 12:36.380
They knew what they were seeking, they knew
what they had to seek and what is to expect

12:36.380 --> 12:38.060
in your seeking.

12:38.060 --> 12:44.870
Though I would say India is today sleeping
compared to you people.

12:44.870 --> 12:46.620
You are awake, you are definitely awake.

12:46.620 --> 12:53.010
Those who know what to seek are sleeping;
those who are awake do not know what to seek.

12:53.010 --> 12:55.130
It’s a funny situation!

12:55.130 --> 13:05.279
But we can understand it by understanding
one fact, that, when the tree grows outside

13:05.279 --> 13:11.720
too much we must know that the roots must
have grown down deep, otherwise the tree cannot

13:11.720 --> 13:13.390
be sustained.

13:13.390 --> 13:22.550
If, in the West, we have grown very much outside,
in the East maybe one or two roots, maybe,

13:22.550 --> 13:27.290
have gone deep down to find out the source
to sustain this tree.

13:27.290 --> 13:30.870
For me, east and west doesn’t exit.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.630
Nor does it exist for anything that is Divine.

13:33.630 --> 13:37.400
It’s a human conception of east and west
and these countries and all that.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.520
It’s only one map, a beautiful picture God
has created.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.690
Only human beings think that we are different
and they are different.

13:43.690 --> 13:48.770
Of course He has created varieties just to
create the joy of beauty.

13:48.770 --> 13:56.060
But He never created east, west, north, south
and the difference between the people.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.670
That’s our own conception.

13:57.670 --> 14:05.620
[But], whatever it is, definitely in the growth
there are two types of people: one are the

14:05.620 --> 14:12.030
people who are growing outside, extroversion
is much more, people are seeking outside,

14:12.030 --> 14:17.490
and there are people who are seeking inside.

14:17.490 --> 14:23.310
I would say like the Pisces, you see, they
have two fishes: one fish is seeking inside

14:23.310 --> 14:24.960
and one fish is seeking outside.

14:24.960 --> 14:31.370
In the same way the whole universe looks to
me that some are seeking outside and some

14:31.370 --> 14:33.540
are seeking inside.

14:33.540 --> 14:43.070
Now those who are seekers of the Divine must
take some guidance from people who have found

14:43.070 --> 14:45.040
out something before.

14:45.040 --> 14:51.600
For example, I had a big discussion with a
gentleman who said, “This is occidental

14:51.600 --> 14:53.800
and this is that…” and all.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.270
I asked him, “Who was Christ?

14:56.270 --> 15:00.240
Was He born in England or in America?

15:00.240 --> 15:02.710
Why did you accept Him?”

15:02.710 --> 15:06.540
I mean He has to be born somewhere!

15:06.540 --> 15:09.470
After all, either He’ll be born in the East
or in the West.

15:09.470 --> 15:14.160
Supposing He’s born in the West: so the
Eastern people should say that, “Because

15:14.160 --> 15:16.290
He was born in the West, we’ll reject Him."

15:16.290 --> 15:20.150
He is born in the East so Western people should
say, “We will reject Him because He was

15:20.150 --> 15:21.430
born in the East!”

15:21.430 --> 15:23.730
This is absurd!

15:23.730 --> 15:27.190
I mean, a person can be born in one place
only, he cannot be born everywhere.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.330
He has to be born somewhere.

15:29.330 --> 15:35.770
But these kind of localised identifications
have led to lots of problems in the minds

15:35.770 --> 15:37.250
of people.

15:37.250 --> 15:44.459
As scientists we have to keep our mind very,
very open to understand what search people

15:44.459 --> 15:53.020
have made in the inner being, to find out
what are we made of, why are we here, why

15:53.020 --> 15:57.720
did we get our evolution from amoeba to this
stage, where have we to reach.

15:57.720 --> 16:01.060
We have to understand the other side of the
picture.

16:01.060 --> 16:07.330
And [it’s] much more necessary for people
who are now seeking that which was found out

16:07.330 --> 16:08.330
in the East.

16:08.330 --> 16:13.660
And Eastern people are seeking that which
you have found out here.

16:13.660 --> 16:16.950
They are getting developed, you see, they
are now getting sophisticated.

16:16.950 --> 16:24.270
While you are trying to find out something
which they had found out without much sophistication.

16:24.270 --> 16:34.120
In the ancient times, a long, long time back,
we had three types of people working out the

16:34.120 --> 16:35.120
seeking.

16:35.120 --> 16:41.720
The first type I would say were the people
who were on the left hand side of this Primordial

16:41.720 --> 16:45.910
Being which you see there with a blue line
.

16:45.910 --> 16:49.580
Have you something to show them?

16:49.580 --> 17:01.940
This blue line is the representative of a
channel called Ida Nadi.

17:01.940 --> 17:09.110
And this channel was discovered thousands
of years back in India.

17:09.110 --> 17:14.880
This channel represents the power of desire
within us.

17:14.880 --> 17:23.519
And the desire reached such a subtle form
that there was a desire to meet God, to be

17:23.519 --> 17:28.339
one with your Spirit; that’s the last desire.

17:28.339 --> 17:39.489
And this desire became what you call as the
power of devotion or dedication or for asking,

17:39.489 --> 17:42.070
“Oh Lord, when are we going to meet?

17:42.070 --> 17:49.919
You must come, and we are waiting for You,”
and all such things which shows that people

17:49.919 --> 17:55.740
believed that there was some Superior Power
and that we had to receive the help from that

17:55.740 --> 17:56.740
Superior Power.

17:56.740 --> 18:00.919
This was one side or one type of people who
existed.

18:00.919 --> 18:08.630
And the other side [that] you see is the yellow
line: this is the power of our action.

18:08.630 --> 18:12.460
The channel is called as Pingala channel.

18:12.460 --> 18:17.559
These are all very subtle channels inside
our spinal cord.

18:17.559 --> 18:27.529
This Pingala channel expressed in the people
who went into action.

18:27.529 --> 18:36.369
Now the power of action in the West, I think,
is a later manifestation of the way people

18:36.369 --> 18:38.289
acted in India.

18:38.289 --> 18:45.159
By this power they try to find out the mysteries
of the matter.

18:45.159 --> 18:47.860
As you know matter is made of five elements.

18:47.860 --> 18:55.149
So they wanted to know how to overpower the
matter; how to harness it, how to use it.

18:55.149 --> 19:01.279
And they tried to find out which are the Deities
which are ruling the material side of life.

19:01.279 --> 19:06.389
For example, which is the Deity for the sea,
what is the Deity for water, what is the Deity

19:06.389 --> 19:10.070
for Sun, Moon and other stars, and all those
things.

19:10.070 --> 19:16.690
And Greeks, I think, went further with it,
very much further, and they got into a wrong

19:16.690 --> 19:19.840
path and they got lost.

19:19.840 --> 19:31.509
But this was the search where people tried
to excite or to master the methods by which

19:31.509 --> 19:35.870
you could control all these five elements.

19:35.870 --> 19:39.730
And this method is expressed in our Vedas.

19:39.730 --> 19:48.049
‘Vida’ means ‘to know’; and the Vedas
are the expressions of all the mantras which

19:48.049 --> 19:50.499
were used to harness the matter.

19:50.499 --> 19:57.369
The result of that is, today, what we feel,
is science: that, through that, now science

19:57.369 --> 20:00.669
is manifested as knowledge to us.

20:00.669 --> 20:03.330
But first they tried to, say, overpower the
fire.

20:03.330 --> 20:10.029
Now there is one way of overpowering the fire:
is from outside to use the fire for cooking,

20:10.029 --> 20:12.010
for this, that, all sorts of things.

20:12.010 --> 20:17.470
Or there could be a method by which you find
out the Deity that rules the fire.

20:17.470 --> 20:23.359
If you can excite the Deity that rules the
fire and can control that Deity or you are

20:23.359 --> 20:30.929
connected with that Deity, then you can manage
to use the fire the way you like.

20:30.929 --> 20:35.630
So the second type of people who went into
these mantras and yagyas and all these things:

20:35.630 --> 20:40.080
they did the fire ceremonies and tried to
control the Sun, Moon and all sort of things;

20:40.080 --> 20:42.269
they were interested [in that].

20:42.269 --> 20:50.239
But now the third type of people, who existed
in the centre, in the central path.

20:50.239 --> 20:55.600
This path is called as the Sushumna path,
and this path is responsible for our evolution

20:55.600 --> 20:57.870
from amoeba to this stage.

20:57.870 --> 21:04.600
Because of this power within us, to evolve,
we became human beings.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.279
Why did we become human beings?

21:06.279 --> 21:07.279
Nobody asks!

21:07.279 --> 21:08.279
We should ask some questions!

21:08.279 --> 21:13.580
All the scientists must ask questions [such
as]: Why did we become human beings?

21:13.580 --> 21:18.990
Why some animals were discarded, and why we
are supposed to be on top of all the evolutionary

21:18.990 --> 21:19.990
process?

21:19.990 --> 21:21.120
And now what is our goal?

21:21.120 --> 21:22.929
Why are we there?

21:22.929 --> 21:25.679
What are we to achieve?

21:25.679 --> 21:37.190
This central path is a very, very important
path for us, for Sahaja Yoga, because, by

21:37.190 --> 21:43.269
these different chakras that there are, the
one is the lower one, then the second, the

21:43.269 --> 21:50.359
third and the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh:
these seven chakras denote vertically our

21:50.359 --> 21:52.330
evolution — vertically.

21:52.330 --> 22:00.460
And horizontally they express our physical,
mental, emotional being.

22:00.460 --> 22:04.899
The first chakra is very important.

22:04.899 --> 22:08.320
This chakra is the centre of Mooladhara.

22:08.320 --> 22:13.220
‘Mooladhara’ means ‘the support of the
root’.

22:13.220 --> 22:17.120
This centre is the centre of our innocence.

22:17.120 --> 22:23.509
The first thing that was created on this Earth
was innocence.

22:23.509 --> 22:28.029
Innocence is the first power that was created.

22:28.029 --> 22:30.580
And that’s what we had to preserve first
of all.

22:30.580 --> 22:34.559
That was the most important thing to preserve:
is our innocence.

22:34.559 --> 22:40.249
Now you will be surprised that this centre
is placed under the Kundalini, not above the

22:40.249 --> 22:41.249
Kundalini.

22:41.249 --> 22:43.330
Kundalini is above that.

22:43.330 --> 22:48.769
Now this Kundalini is the power which is placed
in the sacrum bone, nowhere else.

22:48.769 --> 22:52.950
I mean people can tell you, I have heard the
other day, he was saying, that, “We believe

22:52.950 --> 22:54.230
the Kundalini is here."

22:54.230 --> 22:57.010
I said, “You can believe it, it is here!

22:57.010 --> 22:59.429
I mean, but by believing it is not there!”

22:59.429 --> 23:02.080
Because what you see is the pulsation of Kundalini
in this area.

23:02.080 --> 23:06.480
When Sahaja Yoga starts, in many people, with
the naked eyes, you can see the pulsation

23:06.480 --> 23:12.330
of the Kundalini in this area, on people who
have got some obstruction.

23:12.330 --> 23:14.759
Those who are all right they just get their
Realisation without any difficulties.

23:14.759 --> 23:17.880
But [with] those who have obstruction, many
of you have seen the pulsation in the sacrum

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
bone.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.889
And imagine this bone is called ‘sacrum’!

23:20.889 --> 23:22.239
‘Sacrum’ means ‘sacred’.

23:22.239 --> 23:25.520
So they knew that there was something in it.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.119
Even the Greeks, I think.

23:27.119 --> 23:30.010
Latin is not Greek, but we can say in Latin
language it is called as sacred.

23:30.010 --> 23:37.640
So the sacred bone was containing this Sacred
Power within us known as ‘Kundalini’.

23:37.640 --> 23:42.539
This is the primule, is the germinating power
within us.

23:42.539 --> 23:50.669
Now this fact has been accepted for thousands
of years in India and elsewhere.

23:50.669 --> 23:58.559
In the Bible also it is said that Moses saw
the tree of fire.

23:58.559 --> 24:02.179
That tree of fire is nothing but the whole
Kundalini instrument.

24:02.179 --> 24:10.279
They talk of the Tree of Life: that is the
same as this.

24:10.279 --> 24:13.559
In the Bible it is said, “I will appear
before you like tongues of flames,” [this]

24:13.559 --> 24:14.879
is nothing but these centres.

24:14.879 --> 24:20.080
And these centres, you can see clearly within
yourself, look like living flames as these

24:20.080 --> 24:21.080
are.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.960
But these are static, and they are moving
and living.

24:23.960 --> 24:31.289
So this is the thing that is being described
in our ancient books, in all the scriptures.

24:31.289 --> 24:34.529
Even in Koran they have described as ‘Ruh’,
R-U-H, ‘Ruh’.

24:34.529 --> 24:39.259
‘Ruh’ means the cool breeze, the cool
breeze.

24:39.259 --> 24:44.989
The Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost is described
in the Bible also.

24:44.989 --> 24:47.919
You cannot suddenly start a new idea about
something.

24:47.919 --> 24:54.909
If it is an evolutionary process, if it is
a living process, it must have its background,

24:54.909 --> 24:59.000
its history and it must culminate into something
fruitful.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.769
Like every fruit has a tree behind it and
roots behind it.

25:02.769 --> 25:06.029
You cannot just come out from somewhere and
say, “See now, I have created a fruit!

25:06.029 --> 25:07.890
Now this fruit can become like this."

25:07.890 --> 25:09.590
It has no meaning.

25:09.590 --> 25:12.130
It must be a plastic fruit.

25:12.130 --> 25:13.379
It cannot be a real fruit.

25:13.379 --> 25:17.299
If it is a living fruit it has to come out
of the tree.

25:17.299 --> 25:22.539
That has existed for thousands and thousands
of years and out of that this tree has to

25:22.539 --> 25:23.539
come.

25:23.539 --> 25:24.610
It must have the base.

25:24.610 --> 25:28.320
And this is traditionally called as the Kundalini
awakening process.

25:28.320 --> 25:34.809
Now, this was done, as I told you, there was
only one person at the time of Rama, Nachiketa

25:34.809 --> 25:35.840
who tried to find it.

25:35.840 --> 25:40.429
Yoga Vasishtha was a realised-soul, no doubt,
but he did not give Realisation to anyone.

25:40.429 --> 25:44.279
Only Raja Janaka gave Realisation to one fellow
called Nachiketa.

25:44.279 --> 25:51.109
Even Zen system in which people were supposed
to get their Realisation: they said that nobody

25:51.109 --> 25:55.340
got Realisation except that there were twenty-six
kashyapas.

25:55.340 --> 25:57.740
‘Kashyapas’ means “realised-souls”.

25:57.740 --> 26:02.470
Only twenty-six, because I think it started
about the sixth century.

26:02.470 --> 26:08.109
And for six centuries they had these kashyapas
coming and going, one at a time.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.340
And after that they had none, they had none.

26:11.340 --> 26:15.929
So there are no realised-souls there either.

26:15.929 --> 26:20.509
Christ has said very clearly that, “You
are to be born again."

26:20.509 --> 26:25.149
I mean the whole message of Christ’s life
is Realisation.

26:25.149 --> 26:34.539
Because Judaism talked of the dharma, of the
sustenance, of maintenance of the balance

26:34.539 --> 26:36.820
in the centre.

26:36.820 --> 26:40.049
That also, like a tree, that was very important.

26:40.049 --> 26:47.850
But then Christ came on this Earth to show
that you have to become the Spirit.

26:47.850 --> 26:51.590
By His resurrection He showed that.

26:51.590 --> 26:53.320
And this is the message of Christ.

26:53.320 --> 26:57.019
But in Christianity, I don’t know how many
people are seeking.

26:57.019 --> 27:00.299
They think that by going to church every morning
it’s finished.

27:00.299 --> 27:08.210
Same with the Indians where it was said in
every scripture, even about Vedas the first

27:08.210 --> 27:14.080
thing is said that, “Through this knowledge
if you cannot seek your Spirit, it’s all

27:14.080 --> 27:15.080
useless."

27:15.080 --> 27:19.830
Then we had people like Shankaracharya, Adi
Shankaracharya, who was the person who tried

27:19.830 --> 27:22.039
to re-establish Hinduism.

27:22.039 --> 27:25.029
Who has said that, “Without getting Realisation,
what’s this life?”

27:25.029 --> 27:26.029
“Na yogye, na sankhye."

27:26.029 --> 27:29.889
(meaning: neither by ‘yoga’ nor ‘sankhya’
it is achieved’) By all this talking, blah,

27:29.889 --> 27:31.542
blah blahs, where are you going to lie?

27:31.542 --> 27:35.659
You have to get the grace of the Mother to
get your Realisation.

27:35.659 --> 27:42.049
When he talked first of ‘Vivekachudamani’,
a very big book he wrote, on treaties of Indian

27:42.049 --> 27:45.149
philosophy, people were amazed at his knowledge.

27:45.149 --> 27:50.159
But later on he just wrote ‘Saundarya Lahari’
which is just the description of the Cool

27:50.159 --> 27:52.519
Breeze of the Holy Ghost and of the Holy Ghost.

27:52.519 --> 27:54.029
And people said, “What are you doing?

27:54.029 --> 27:57.070
You are just praising the Holy Ghost and not
writing any philosophy."

27:57.070 --> 27:59.009
He said, “There is no philosophy.

27:59.009 --> 28:04.460
It’s a spontaneous thing which should happen
to all of us, and just the praise is the way

28:04.460 --> 28:05.460
you get it."

28:05.460 --> 28:07.529
Just imagine a person of his calibre.

28:07.529 --> 28:13.700
But what are the Hindus doing today is nothing
but the same old-style techniques and ritualism

28:13.700 --> 28:16.379
and all nonsense; they are also lost.

28:16.379 --> 28:26.020
I mean there is such a pickle, made out of
every great incarnation, that to me it was

28:26.020 --> 28:33.559
a shock to see how they have been able to
spoil every incarnation into zero, and some

28:33.559 --> 28:41.919
sort of a nonsensical image of every incarnation
who came on this Earth to emancipate, to give

28:41.919 --> 28:45.509
you a higher life, a higher awareness.

28:45.509 --> 28:50.720
So we come to the point where we have to think
what we have to expect.

28:50.720 --> 28:56.470
The first thing is: if it is a living process,
it has to be spontaneous.

28:56.470 --> 29:05.580
This is very difficult for people to understand:
that it has to be spontaneous.

29:05.580 --> 29:13.140
For example, if this flower has to become
the fruit, what is the technique?

29:13.140 --> 29:19.149
Do you stand before it for hours together
or do you jump before it, or you stand on

29:19.149 --> 29:23.529
your heads [so] that it becomes?

29:23.529 --> 29:29.229
Anything spontaneous [that] you have seen,
which is living, happens by itself.

29:29.229 --> 29:30.999
There is no technique.

29:30.999 --> 29:35.149
When I say there is no technique, people do
not want to believe it, because technique

29:35.149 --> 29:36.149
they want.

29:36.149 --> 29:40.759
But you have taken for granted all these things,
isn’t it?

29:40.759 --> 29:47.200
I mean, one day you are sleeping, you find
that the blossom time has come, lots of flowers

29:47.200 --> 29:48.399
are there.

29:48.399 --> 29:52.769
One morning you get up you find most of the
flowers have become fruits, and you take it

29:52.769 --> 29:53.769
for granted.

29:53.769 --> 29:56.419
Do you ask for a technique there?

29:56.419 --> 30:00.239
In the same way what technique did you employ
to become human beings from amoeba?

30:00.239 --> 30:04.399
Say from monkey’s state to human beings:
did you cut your tails to become human beings?

30:04.399 --> 30:07.741
Didn’t we become spontaneously that?

30:07.741 --> 30:08.741
It’s rather difficult to accept.

30:08.741 --> 30:13.700
But logically, you tell me, if it is a living
process, what do we have do?

30:13.700 --> 30:20.179
It is impossible to explain to people that
there is no technique.

30:20.179 --> 30:22.200
They must have a technique.

30:22.200 --> 30:27.870
Now why do we want to have a technique?Let
us face ourselves.

30:27.870 --> 30:33.229
Because we think we must do something about
it: if we are not doing anything about it,

30:33.229 --> 30:34.899
then how can we get it?

30:34.899 --> 30:40.529
Because we think whatever we have got in this
world is through our effort, by working for

30:40.529 --> 30:41.529
it.

30:41.529 --> 30:42.529
But what have you got?

30:42.529 --> 30:43.529
You’ve got everything dead!

30:43.529 --> 30:44.529
Say for example, something is dead, these
stones are dead and you have made a building

30:44.529 --> 30:46.110
out of it.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.159
So what?

30:47.159 --> 30:48.879
Dead from the dead!

30:48.879 --> 30:53.129
What have you got living with you?

30:53.129 --> 30:55.690
Have you got any living powers?

30:55.690 --> 30:59.599
Can you give life to a fruit or to a tree?

30:59.599 --> 31:01.730
You cannot.

31:01.730 --> 31:02.730
What have you achieved?

31:02.730 --> 31:03.730
Is only dead.

31:03.730 --> 31:05.259
With effort you can only achieve dead.

31:05.259 --> 31:08.179
Have you achieved anything living?

31:08.179 --> 31:13.259
If you put such a question to yourself then
you will understand that living processes,

31:13.259 --> 31:19.840
we have to accept, are spontaneous: we cannot
put any technique on it.

31:19.840 --> 31:27.659
As soon as we want to have technique, we must
know this is our Mr Ego who wants to get satisfied.

31:27.659 --> 31:30.590
I have seen people doing that.

31:30.590 --> 31:37.190
For example I will give you a very concrete
example of a gentleman who came to me and

31:37.190 --> 31:38.190
he said, “No, no.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.190
How can be it that be simple Mother?

31:39.190 --> 31:40.190
How can it be that simple?”

31:40.190 --> 31:44.499
I told him that, “See: your breathing is
so simple.

31:44.499 --> 31:47.879
If you have to read books and go into techniques
for your breathing, how many people would

31:47.879 --> 31:49.080
be living?”

31:49.080 --> 31:50.349
But he would not accept me.

31:50.349 --> 31:52.779
He said, “You must give us a technique otherwise
we’ll not be happy."

31:52.779 --> 31:59.379
Now there’s a very great realised-soul living
in India but he is a very strict person, he’s

31:59.379 --> 32:01.899
not a Mother and he has no tolerance for any
nonsense.

32:01.899 --> 32:06.290
So he had once told me, “If somebody troubles
you, send the fellow over to me."

32:06.290 --> 32:07.290
So I told him, “You go and see the guruji,
such and such."

32:07.290 --> 32:10.149
He was very enamoured that, “This gentleman
has called me!”

32:10.149 --> 32:16.599
So he had to climb up seven miles up on a
hill where this gentleman was sitting there.

32:16.599 --> 32:21.029
He went there, and he started talking, “Blah,
blah, blah,” to him that, “See, Mother

32:21.029 --> 32:24.609
doesn’t give any technique to us and She’s
just giving Realisation to every Dick, Tom

32:24.609 --> 32:25.639
and Harry and this and that!”

32:25.639 --> 32:26.639
He said, “Yah!

32:26.639 --> 32:27.950
Really, She’s doing wrong, isn’t it?

32:27.950 --> 32:31.140
All right, you be here and you eat your food
and sleep here!”

32:31.140 --> 32:37.210
After a month I found the gentleman came to
see me with both his legs round his neck,

32:37.210 --> 32:38.450
dangling in the air.

32:38.450 --> 32:41.169
I said, “What’s happened?”

32:41.169 --> 32:44.110
I mean, really tears came into my eyes and
I said, “What’s happened?

32:44.110 --> 32:47.169
What this guru has done to him?”

32:47.169 --> 32:48.289
He came and started crying.

32:48.289 --> 32:49.739
He said, “Mother, never send me to that
guru."

32:49.739 --> 32:54.190
I said, “But you were very anxious to go
to him, because you wanted something to climb

32:54.190 --> 32:55.190
up to see him."

32:55.190 --> 32:58.719
He said, “He made really a mess out of me."

32:58.719 --> 33:03.129
In the night because this guru, his limbs
are broken and hands are broken, so he goes

33:03.129 --> 33:04.129
on a tiger.

33:04.129 --> 33:06.940
So he said, “And this tiger came and pushed
me into a ghat!

33:06.940 --> 33:12.840
And I was lying there about thirteen, fourteen
feet down below, and this guru after three,

33:12.840 --> 33:19.749
four days lowered down some rotis, some breads
to me, and he said, “Now eat it and stay

33:19.749 --> 33:20.749
there.

33:20.749 --> 33:24.229
And till you promise me that you will not
go and trouble Mataji, I am not going to take

33:24.229 --> 33:26.169
you out of this place!”

33:26.169 --> 33:29.919
And then after two days he sent a few people
to pick him up and brought.

33:29.919 --> 33:33.590
He said, “I am not here to take money from
you.

33:33.590 --> 33:35.289
You cannot give me money, anything.

33:35.289 --> 33:37.249
But I will only teach you a good lesson!”

33:37.249 --> 33:39.389
He said, “I have had enough of it."

33:39.389 --> 33:43.759
He said, “Now you take these legs around
your neck, go dangling to Mataji, and She’s

33:43.759 --> 33:44.929
going to cure you.

33:44.929 --> 33:46.369
I am not going to cure you.

33:46.369 --> 33:48.950
And don’t come and tell me stories!”

33:48.950 --> 33:52.349
“Oh God” I said, “Look at this,” then
of course we tried and worked on him, that’s

33:52.349 --> 33:53.349
a different point.

33:53.349 --> 33:54.349
But this is what it is.

33:54.349 --> 33:57.519
He said he wants technique, so he gave him
a technique.

33:57.519 --> 34:03.080
Another fellow who was like this, a doctor,
he was troubling me, and I didn’t tell him,

34:03.080 --> 34:05.549
but he felt that he should go and see this
guru.

34:05.549 --> 34:10.270
And for one month he made this fellow clean
a Shiva’s temple, taking the water seven

34:10.270 --> 34:13.750
miles every day, morning and evening: with
one bucket cleaning in Shiva’s temple!

34:13.750 --> 34:17.810
And doctor came back, he was so thinned down,
absolutely exhausted.

34:17.810 --> 34:20.629
I said, “What’s the matter?”

34:20.629 --> 34:23.059
He said, “I was cleaning Shiva’s temple
for a month!”

34:23.059 --> 34:26.639
So when I met this guru I asked him, “Why
did you do that to him?”

34:26.639 --> 34:27.990
He said, “For a donkey, you better give
donkey’s job!

34:27.990 --> 34:29.620
It’s no use telling them something of the
higher life.

34:29.620 --> 34:32.070
They don’t want it.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.510
They want donkey’s life.

34:34.510 --> 34:39.659
So let them jump and do what they like.

34:39.659 --> 34:42.299
Let them be donkeys.

34:42.299 --> 34:45.990
Why should You try to give them [everything]
so simple?”

34:45.990 --> 34:46.990
I was amazed at him.

34:46.990 --> 34:49.560
He said, “Mother, you are a Mother and you
do what you like because this is your whim.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.799
But as far as we are concerned we are not
going to give Realisation to anyone.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.129
I have given it to one, and he’s become
a hopeless man."

34:55.129 --> 35:02.150
So I went to see this gentleman one day, the
one who took twenty-five years to get his

35:02.150 --> 35:03.150
Realisation.

35:03.150 --> 35:06.440
And because somebody, one of my disciples
had to invite him.

35:06.440 --> 35:11.170
Now this fellow was smoking cigarettes like
this, sitting before me and he was talking

35:11.170 --> 35:16.599
quite a lot, and there were girls and women
pressing his feet and doing all kinds of things.

35:16.599 --> 35:19.170
Of course he got up, touched my feet.

35:19.170 --> 35:23.240
He sat down, then he started saying that,
“Now why this [Gagangiri] Maharaj is coming

35:23.240 --> 35:24.730
to see you in Bombay?

35:24.730 --> 35:26.240
After all he should not leave his place.

35:26.240 --> 35:29.059
He has been there for a hundred and eight
years,” this, that.

35:29.059 --> 35:32.740
I said, “Who are you to judge him?

35:32.740 --> 35:33.780
Why are you judging him?

35:33.780 --> 35:34.780
He’s your guru.

35:34.780 --> 35:35.780
Why should you judge him?

35:35.780 --> 35:36.780
He has given you Realisation."

35:36.780 --> 35:37.780
“Yes, yes, he’s given me Realisation,
I know.

35:37.780 --> 35:38.780
But I can also tell him something."

35:38.780 --> 35:39.930
I said, “But what about your smoking?

35:39.930 --> 35:41.160
You are still on with the smoking."

35:41.160 --> 35:42.630
“Oh, I don’t care.

35:42.630 --> 35:44.090
I am beyond everything!”

35:44.090 --> 35:45.560
I said, “All right."

35:45.560 --> 35:48.540
Then I sat down watching him for a while.

35:48.540 --> 35:52.920
I said, “Now I am going home."

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
I said, “You apply this tika to me."

35:53.920 --> 35:55.630
I said, “All right, first I will apply,”
so I applied [to] him.

35:55.630 --> 36:00.240
I said, “Now you apply,” and I sucked
his finger, this is Agnya’s finger of ego.

36:00.240 --> 36:05.060
I sucked his finger on my Agnya, and he went
on “Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!” like that.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.060
He said, “Mother, Mother, Mother what you
are doing?”

36:06.060 --> 36:08.420
I said, “Nothing, nothing.

36:08.420 --> 36:10.170
You are great, you are a realised-soul.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.710
Why should you shake before me?

36:11.710 --> 36:12.740
Why are you shaking?

36:12.740 --> 36:13.849
Why don’t you get all right?

36:13.849 --> 36:14.849
Why are you shaking?”

36:14.849 --> 36:16.420
He said, “No, no, no please stop it, stop
it."

36:16.420 --> 36:21.119
I said, “Now, first promise that you are
not going to talk ill of your guru and stop

36:21.119 --> 36:24.299
all this nonsense of having women around and
making money!”

36:24.299 --> 36:29.799
But then the person with whom he went, he
swindled them completely, just imagine!

36:29.799 --> 36:35.180
And I asked this gentleman who met me at the
airport, “Why did you give money to this

36:35.180 --> 36:36.180
man?”

36:36.180 --> 36:39.920
They said, “Mother, because he said, ‘See,
I was shaking before Mother because I was

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
giving power to Her!’”

36:40.920 --> 36:41.920
I said, “Such fools!

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
Why did you give him the money?

36:42.920 --> 36:45.200
Why didn’t you ask me what was happening?”

36:45.200 --> 36:48.819
This is what it is.

36:48.819 --> 36:55.010
When you want technique, then in the market
there are thousand and one to give you technique,

36:55.010 --> 36:56.010
anything.

36:56.010 --> 36:59.200
They may tell you that put this [candle] on
your head, light this, and walk on the street.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.779
And you will find thousands of them walking
like this, and the price of this [candle]

37:01.779 --> 37:05.650
will go up in the market, and people will
be doing it.

37:05.650 --> 37:12.309
Any sort of nonsense they will give you, they
would like to do it!

37:12.309 --> 37:18.940
For example, these people at Oxford Street:
they are standing there, [the] Hareramas.

37:18.940 --> 37:25.430
They had cleaned their hair completely and
applied those, what we call them shendis in

37:25.430 --> 37:27.530
India, I don’t know what you call.

37:27.530 --> 37:30.990
And they are sold in the market; do you know?

37:30.990 --> 37:32.920
Like all other wigs, they are sold as wigs
there, and that is to applied there.

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
And when they were dancing that was falling
down, you know!

37:33.920 --> 37:38.599
And the dress and sari they were wearing was
also falling down!

37:38.599 --> 37:40.359
And such foolish people.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.980
I said, “What do they think?

37:41.980 --> 37:44.830
By doing this, are they going to get God?”

37:44.830 --> 37:52.140
I said, “But why don’t you sit down and
receive the blessings and why to do [this]?”

37:52.140 --> 37:54.380
They said, “But what’s wrong in clothes.

37:54.380 --> 37:55.570
What is the need to have clothes?”

37:55.570 --> 37:56.750
I said, “That’s not the point!

37:56.750 --> 38:03.329
What I am saying if by becoming naked, if
you can become God, all the animals must go

38:03.329 --> 38:05.430
to God first, before you!”

38:05.430 --> 38:08.980
You must understand what should happen to
you: is there should be a new dimension which

38:08.980 --> 38:09.980
must be enlightened within you.

38:09.980 --> 38:15.450
A new dimension must come into you.

38:15.450 --> 38:18.630
What about your own power: have you got you
own powers?

38:18.630 --> 38:22.260
If you are spiritually evolved, you must have
your own powers.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.529
This is like enslavement.

38:24.529 --> 38:25.529
I said, “What are our own powers?”

38:25.529 --> 38:28.780
I said, “Can you tell in this person where
is the Kundalini?”

38:28.780 --> 38:30.160
They said, “No, we don’t know.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.569
We have never heard about it."

38:31.569 --> 38:33.599
“Can you tell what are your centres catching?

38:33.599 --> 38:35.200
Can you tell where are his centres rising?”

38:35.200 --> 38:36.980
He said, “No, we cannot."

38:36.980 --> 38:41.880
So I called him, I said, “Come along, have
your Realisation."

38:41.880 --> 38:44.710
One of them I got hold of, somehow or other
brought him.

38:44.710 --> 38:47.270
I think he was not interested in Realisation
at all.

38:47.270 --> 38:49.270
He was not at all interested.

38:49.270 --> 38:52.089
He was interested in exhibitionism.

38:52.089 --> 38:55.000
He wanted to exhibition himself in that Oxford
Street that’s why he went there.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Absolutely that’s true.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.359
Otherwise, if he was, he would have said,
“All right, if you are saying ‘I am giving

38:57.359 --> 38:59.690
you Realisation,’ let me have it!”

38:59.690 --> 39:03.220
He said, “How can that be so silly?”

39:03.220 --> 39:04.220
I said, “What silly?

39:04.220 --> 39:08.270
I said, “How can it be silly?”

39:08.270 --> 39:09.859
I said, “The wisest”.

39:09.859 --> 39:14.340
But must be somebody else is silly to see
things which are silly.

39:14.340 --> 39:17.180
Like mad people: if you go to a lunatic asylum
they think you all are mad.

39:17.180 --> 39:24.920
Once our prime minister went to a lunatic
asylum and one lunatic came and started talking

39:24.920 --> 39:25.920
to him very nicely.

39:25.920 --> 39:26.920
He said, “How are you?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.330
When did you come here?

39:28.330 --> 39:29.330
And who are you?”

39:29.330 --> 39:31.900
So he said, “I am Jawaharlal Nehru, I am
the prime minister of India."

39:31.900 --> 39:33.829
He said, “All right, all right, you’ll
be all right also.

39:33.829 --> 39:38.170
I used to say the same thing."

39:38.170 --> 39:39.440
(laughter)

39:39.440 --> 39:43.549
But how do you judge whether you are right
or wrong?

39:43.549 --> 39:44.950
Where are you?

39:44.950 --> 39:50.190
The judgment comes when you have the dimension
to judge.

39:50.190 --> 39:52.260
When you are Realised you can judge.

39:52.260 --> 39:54.589
You can say what chakras are catching.

39:54.589 --> 39:59.760
When Self-realisation comes in, you know all
about these centres and you know all about

39:59.760 --> 40:01.880
these channels; about yourself and about others.

40:01.880 --> 40:06.039
The collective consciousness becomes an actualisation;
it becomes part and parcel of you.

40:06.039 --> 40:10.720
Like an egg when it gets transformed, you
really get a bird!

40:10.720 --> 40:14.410
It’s not just “blah, blah, blah."

40:14.410 --> 40:18.930
You just get to see the bird with its wings
and everything.

40:18.930 --> 40:21.359
A transformation takes place.

40:21.359 --> 40:28.089
Your awareness must have that actual dimension
within itself, inside.

40:28.089 --> 40:33.430
Not outside by developing your some sort of
a horn or wearing some sort of a bushy hair.

40:33.430 --> 40:38.789
It’s something that happens to you within
where…(break in recording)…comes through

40:38.789 --> 40:42.650
when you start judging yourself.

40:42.650 --> 40:45.740
But God is compassion.

40:45.740 --> 40:47.289
He’s love.

40:47.289 --> 40:55.119
He gives you [the] chance, all the powers
to clear yourself and cleanse yourself.

40:55.119 --> 41:03.480
But nobody can help a person who is so dump
founded or mesmerised or who is such a, I

41:03.480 --> 41:09.290
would say, unintelligent person; who doesn’t
understand that something has to happen to

41:09.290 --> 41:12.460
your awareness.

41:12.460 --> 41:14.190
Then only you have achieved something.

41:14.190 --> 41:21.430
For days in and days out they are going and
going and going and achieving nothing.

41:21.430 --> 41:24.119
Somebody told me, “Oh, they are people who
love each other very much."

41:24.119 --> 41:25.119
“How do you know?”

41:25.119 --> 41:26.890
“They kiss each other quite a lot."

41:26.890 --> 41:28.319
I said, “What is there?”

41:28.319 --> 41:30.869
Any licentious society you find such kissing
going on.

41:30.869 --> 41:36.940
For example if you go to France, I mean, it’s
horrifyingly kissing society, I tell you.

41:36.940 --> 41:39.500
Everybody has a right to kiss everyone they
feel like.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.079
I mean, it’s sometimes so much that you
really get frightened of the whole thing:

41:42.079 --> 41:44.589
anybody can come and kiss you, anybody is
supposed to…

41:44.589 --> 41:46.200
I mean, I don’t know how it works out but
it’s so.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.200
So I said, “What is, so [great] in kissing?

41:47.200 --> 41:48.200
There’s no love!”

41:48.200 --> 41:57.990
Love is a thing which is not expressed in
that way, but which works, which flows.

41:57.990 --> 42:03.200
It’s a power which acts, just like the sun’s
rays.

42:03.200 --> 42:05.619
Sun’s rays come and act on the leaves.

42:05.619 --> 42:13.299
In the same way the love flows and acts on
the Kundalini, and it gives Realisation to

42:13.299 --> 42:14.299
others.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.519
It transforms your life.

42:16.519 --> 42:18.980
You become a different person altogether.

42:18.980 --> 42:22.529
You become a master of yourself when you overpower
everything.

42:22.529 --> 42:29.950
Of course some are, I would call them, lame
people, so they need little more time.

42:29.950 --> 42:33.530
Some are very fast ones and some are so quick
that they once get it, they never lose it.

42:33.530 --> 42:41.890
And then the real growth of the new personality
starts in which you start enjoying that bliss

42:41.890 --> 42:43.089
which is promised.

42:43.089 --> 42:46.690
All that is said before has to be proved today
— every thing.

42:46.690 --> 42:55.410
Now like we went to one of the Protestant
Church meeting.

42:55.410 --> 42:57.880
I mean Catholics and Protestants and all sorts
of things, you know!

42:57.880 --> 43:01.130
I am facing, mullahs and priests and this
and that.

43:01.130 --> 43:02.890
But these people they said, “We believe
in Christ."

43:02.890 --> 43:03.890
I said, “Very good!

43:03.890 --> 43:07.490
That’s a very good thing to do, is to believe
in Christ, thank God.

43:07.490 --> 43:13.250
At least there is no anarchist or somebody
who is anti-Christ I am facing here!

43:13.250 --> 43:15.320
But,” I said, “where is Christ?”

43:15.320 --> 43:16.320
“He’s everywhere."

43:16.320 --> 43:17.390
I said, “All right.

43:17.390 --> 43:18.960
But how do you contact Him?”

43:18.960 --> 43:25.500
Everywhere there is ether, everywhere there
are pictures, everywhere there is music, but

43:25.500 --> 43:29.339
how do you get them in the television?

43:29.339 --> 43:30.539
How do you contact?

43:30.539 --> 43:37.450
He is placed in a centre within us and we
can prove it, through the Kundalini awakening,

43:37.450 --> 43:39.230
that Christ is there.

43:39.230 --> 43:44.460
Because when Kundalini reaches that centre,
the centre which is on the optic thalamus,

43:44.460 --> 43:49.789
which controls the pituitary and the pineal
body, [that], in that centre, resides Christ

43:49.789 --> 43:51.650
can be proved through Kundalini awakening.

43:51.650 --> 43:57.150
Because when Kundalini arrives at that point
and it does not pierce, you have to take the

43:57.150 --> 43:59.700
name of Christ and then Kundalini moves on.

43:59.700 --> 44:04.099
But not the person who is not realised, the
one who is realised can only do it.

44:04.099 --> 44:08.480
So there are two types of people you find
in Sahaja Yoga, is the people who are realised

44:08.480 --> 44:10.579
and those who are not realised.

44:10.579 --> 44:14.839
Now here the conflict starts that people who
are realised can shock other people because

44:14.839 --> 44:16.319
they say some things very positively.

44:16.319 --> 44:21.180
They say that, “See, this is wrong, you
should give up these things.

44:21.180 --> 44:23.550
This is not going to lead you anywhere."

44:23.550 --> 44:27.369
And they look just like as you are but they
know about your chakras.

44:27.369 --> 44:31.280
And when they tell you, you get angry with
them and half of them leave, but that’s

44:31.280 --> 44:32.280
not the way.

44:32.280 --> 44:33.690
One should know that they are just trying
to help you.

44:33.690 --> 44:37.339
They were just the same as you were.

44:37.339 --> 44:41.690
Maybe even worse than you were or maybe much
worse than you were but today they have reached

44:41.690 --> 44:44.980
the place from where they can feel you.

44:44.980 --> 44:49.801
And you are also going to do the same, so
there is nothing to be shocked about or to

44:49.801 --> 44:50.870
be angry with.

44:50.870 --> 44:58.809
But there’s tremendous difference in any
artificial type of technique and the real

44:58.809 --> 45:01.109
is this that they know what it is.

45:01.109 --> 45:07.579
If you tie the eyes of ten people or ten young
people who are realised-souls, two are sitting

45:07.579 --> 45:10.769
here, they all of them will say the same thing.

45:10.769 --> 45:13.099
For example, if you ask them, where is this
gentleman catching?

45:13.099 --> 45:17.450
They will show the same finger.

45:17.450 --> 45:24.849
And this is such a subjective thing, such
a thing as your own, which has no whims, nothing.

45:24.849 --> 45:26.539
It’s absolutely definite.

45:26.539 --> 45:38.680
Now the last point which I would like to cover
today is that, as a result of Sahaja Yoga:

45:38.680 --> 45:43.680
this is the chocolate on the castor oil, we
can say.

45:43.680 --> 45:49.960
The advantage of Sahaja Yoga is felt immediately,
immediately.

45:49.960 --> 45:57.549
First of all physical ailments get cured.

45:57.549 --> 46:08.720
Now for your information I may have to say
this that in ten minutes Sahaja Yoga cured

46:08.720 --> 46:15.880
the cancer of our President Sanjeev Reddy
in India; in ten minutes.

46:15.880 --> 46:20.180
Cancer cannot be cured by anything else but
Sahaja Yoga – it’s a fact.

46:20.180 --> 46:29.490
For example, now doctors have reached the
stage to say that cancer is caused by some

46:29.490 --> 46:36.090
protein matter which attacks us from the areas
which are within us, which are built within

46:36.090 --> 46:38.450
us since the Creation.

46:38.450 --> 46:44.660
Now within us what are these areas, let us
see.

46:44.660 --> 46:54.150
On the left hand side of this Ida Nadi or
this blue line is the collective subconscious.

46:54.150 --> 47:03.609
On the right hand side of this yellow line
which is called as the Pingala Nadi is the

47:03.609 --> 47:05.609
collective supra-conscious.

47:05.609 --> 47:09.349
Below is the Hell.

47:09.349 --> 47:15.480
On top is the super-consciousness which we
call as Self-realisation because this is the

47:15.480 --> 47:19.369
seat of the Spirit, which is manifested in
the heart.

47:19.369 --> 47:23.549
These are the areas, of course doctors don’t
know.

47:23.549 --> 47:29.819
But whatever the psychologists start talking
like blind people can be easily seen through

47:29.819 --> 47:31.940
when the lights are on.

47:31.940 --> 47:37.869
For example, from the left side and the right
side I have always said there are entities

47:37.869 --> 47:38.869
which attack you.

47:38.869 --> 47:44.390
Those who disappeared in the Creation went
out of circulation because they were not good

47:44.390 --> 47:47.029
for our evolution, they all exist there.

47:47.029 --> 47:52.539
Say, there are some vegetables which form
viruses, there are some birds, some animals

47:52.539 --> 47:56.670
and many human beings who exist on both the
sides.

47:56.670 --> 48:02.559
On the right hand side are the people who
are very ambitious, who dealt with material

48:02.559 --> 48:07.849
things and who try to overpower matter and
tried all kinds of tricks.

48:07.849 --> 48:11.950
These are the people who are still there existing
within us.

48:11.950 --> 48:18.240
When we try to go to the extremes, either
to the left or to the right, by any one of

48:18.240 --> 48:20.559
these techniques, we get caught up.

48:20.559 --> 48:27.140
And when this thing happens, these proteins,
so-called ’58 protein’ and number some

48:27.140 --> 48:31.430
sort of 56, all these are nothing but they
are entities.

48:31.430 --> 48:35.569
They attack us and they trigger the cancer
within us.

48:35.569 --> 48:40.539
And once this is triggered there is no way
out because once you are in these areas, you’ll

48:40.539 --> 48:47.500
be attacked more and more, and the galloping
state is established.

48:47.500 --> 48:54.349
For example, now let us take the case of blood
cancer: a simple thing like blood cancer.

48:54.349 --> 48:57.430
It’s the most simple thing and is very simple
to treat also.

48:57.430 --> 49:01.259
[Dr.] David Spiro is laughing at it!

49:01.259 --> 49:05.099
All right, how you get it?

49:05.099 --> 49:10.080
The spleen is the speedometer within us, spleen
which is placed on the left hand side like

49:10.080 --> 49:11.750
a round ball.

49:11.750 --> 49:18.310
(No, on top a little bit.

49:18.310 --> 49:25.960
David can you come and show them?

49:25.960 --> 49:28.140
Yes, correct!

49:28.140 --> 49:31.190
We should put it in the Void only, so it’s
better!

49:31.190 --> 49:34.309
Near the Void you can say.)

49:34.309 --> 49:43.329
Now spleen is managed by Swadhishthan Chakra,
which moves round and round the Void, you

49:43.329 --> 49:44.329
see.

49:44.329 --> 49:49.160
And it is the one which really sets our speed
and pace: both things are done by the Swadhishthana

49:49.160 --> 49:50.160
Chakra.

49:50.160 --> 49:55.869
But this poor spleen is creating blood cells
for us.

49:55.869 --> 50:01.220
First of all if you think too much then the
Swadhishthana Chakra has to convert the fat

50:01.220 --> 50:07.569
cells for the use of the brain and it neglects
the spleen, the liver, the pancreas, the kidneys

50:07.569 --> 50:08.569
and the uterus.

50:08.569 --> 50:15.210
But when it neglects the spleen, this is the
first cause [of blood cancer], the primal

50:15.210 --> 50:17.579
cause we can call it.

50:17.579 --> 50:22.190
Secondly, those people who are supposed to
be very speedy — those who think too much

50:22.190 --> 50:23.980
are speedy people also.

50:23.980 --> 50:31.540
They will eat their food with such a speed,
I can tell you, that I have seen people that

50:31.540 --> 50:35.543
they can polish off things before…I mean,
you see them there, and it’s finished! (laughter)

50:35.543 --> 50:43.599
They are so fast, and if I am sitting with
them, I am really starving because I just

50:43.599 --> 50:45.130
can’t keep pace with them!

50:45.130 --> 50:48.190
Just you serve them, and it’s finished,
it’s polished off!

50:48.190 --> 50:53.599
Then they will eat with that speed and immediately
finishing that plate there and they run off

50:53.599 --> 50:54.599
for some other work.

50:54.599 --> 51:00.609
Now this poor spleen has to now create blood
for the digestion, then suddenly the fellow

51:00.609 --> 51:05.089
runs out [so] it has to give the blood cells
for it’s running.

51:05.089 --> 51:08.690
Then he sits down and he starts thinking.

51:08.690 --> 51:10.500
While running he is thinking.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.109
He is doing many things.

51:12.109 --> 51:17.610
We think our body is a multipurpose machine.

51:17.610 --> 51:21.640
So with one thing we will be brushing, with
another thing we will be doing something else,

51:21.640 --> 51:26.089
with ears we will be doing something else,
with nose we will be doing something else,

51:26.089 --> 51:27.940
with stomach we will be doing something else.

51:27.940 --> 51:33.549
Like that, the whole body is poor thing busy
with multipurpose things: poor this body.

51:33.549 --> 51:36.440
And then this spleen becomes really mad!

51:36.440 --> 51:39.339
It goes bizarre, as you call it.

51:39.339 --> 51:42.369
It does not know what is wrong with the fellow.

51:42.369 --> 51:48.230
It does not know when it will jump and when
it will go into some sort of a new activity.

51:48.230 --> 51:55.769
So it goes really bizarre, and then the cells
that are created by it become malignant cells,

51:55.769 --> 51:59.160
and blood cancer is settled.

51:59.160 --> 52:06.680
But the third thing that really, that really,
attacks it is one of these entities catching

52:06.680 --> 52:12.450
hold of these blood cells, and blood cancer
is set in.

52:12.450 --> 52:15.190
And blood cancer can be very easily cured.

52:15.190 --> 52:20.230
I have seen now three cases, where doctors
predicted that the patient is going to die

52:20.230 --> 52:24.630
within fifteen days, is still surviving after
three years, quite hale and hearty!

52:24.630 --> 52:31.420
If you just pull your attention through Kundalini
awakening and pierce it through here, the

52:31.420 --> 52:36.900
attention which is spread out on left and
right and gone to the extreme like this, stretched,

52:36.900 --> 52:45.109
can be pushed out onto the super-consciousness,
immediately all your attacks are finished.

52:45.109 --> 52:50.340
All of them are left high and dry in their
own places, and you are cured.

52:50.340 --> 52:55.299
And that is how blood cancer can be cured
very easily in Sahaja Yoga.

52:55.299 --> 53:00.190
But that doesn’t mean you think of all the
blood cancer patients you have and bring them

53:00.190 --> 53:01.190
along here!

53:01.190 --> 53:02.359
That always happens.

53:02.359 --> 53:03.930
I would request you not to do that.

53:03.930 --> 53:07.039
You see, this happened at the time of Christ
and it should not be repeated again.

53:07.039 --> 53:13.070
God is interested in curing people who are
seekers, who are seeking God and not curing

53:13.070 --> 53:14.940
people who are not seeking.

53:14.940 --> 53:18.539
You do not look after a lamp which never is
going to be enlightened; you just throw it

53:18.539 --> 53:19.640
in the junk!

53:19.640 --> 53:24.270
In the same way those who are seekers get
their Realisation and get their cancer, all

53:24.270 --> 53:27.990
kinds of incurable diseases, diabetes this,
that, lots of things, are cured.

53:27.990 --> 53:29.849
I mean [the list is] endless.

53:29.849 --> 53:34.190
So this is the first thing that happens: is
physical.

53:34.190 --> 53:39.670
Then mental: you know there are some people
who are here sitting today who were horribly

53:39.670 --> 53:41.420
epileptic.

53:41.420 --> 53:45.359
Some of them used to scream for three hours,
thanks to some great gurus who have managed

53:45.359 --> 53:48.250
to polish off everything that they had.

53:48.250 --> 53:50.829
Who have managed to take away all their money,
mesmerise them completely.

53:50.829 --> 53:57.029
And those who became epileptic falling on
the street, even some of the children, who

53:57.029 --> 54:02.930
are here now today, who have been absolutely
cured of epilepsy, madness, schizophrenia,

54:02.930 --> 54:08.799
all sort of diseases like that, because again
the same thing happens to you that your attention

54:08.799 --> 54:13.900
goes into the super-consciousness, which is,
collective consciousness.

54:13.900 --> 54:19.299
Collective consciousness gets enlightened
within you, it becomes actualised.

54:19.299 --> 54:21.529
It gets manifesting itself.

54:21.529 --> 54:24.549
It’s such a wonderful instrument you are
— a human being.

54:24.549 --> 54:25.549
You have no idea.

54:25.549 --> 54:27.790
Only thing is you have to be plugged to the
mains.

54:27.790 --> 54:33.589
Like a television set, once it is plugged
to the mains, it starts manifesting, you also

54:33.589 --> 54:35.009
start manifesting.

54:35.009 --> 54:36.720
Nothing that I do, I do not do anything.

54:36.720 --> 54:42.539
Actually really, it is something like everything
is ready, and one enlightened light can enlighten

54:42.539 --> 54:43.880
another light!

54:43.880 --> 54:44.880
What is there to be done?

54:44.880 --> 54:46.480
You are just ready and you just receive your
own powers.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.650
I don’t do anything.

54:48.650 --> 54:51.660
And why should one feel so hurt if I am doing
it?

54:51.660 --> 54:53.240
It’s something surprising.

54:53.240 --> 54:54.950
Because a gentleman very seriously asked me,
“Why you?”

54:54.950 --> 54:55.950
He was a doctor.

54:55.950 --> 54:59.160
I said, “Doctor, I will be thankful you
come in my place.

54:59.160 --> 55:04.150
Here I am, I have to work till two o’clock
in the night.

55:04.150 --> 55:05.369
I have to work so very hard, such a thankless
job.

55:05.369 --> 55:06.369
You better do it!

55:06.369 --> 55:07.369
I’ll be very happy to be your disciple!

55:07.369 --> 55:08.960
And whatever you say, I am willing to do.

55:08.960 --> 55:11.200
You awaken the Kundalini of people!”

55:11.200 --> 55:13.299
He said, “But I cannot."

55:13.299 --> 55:15.830
So I said, “That’s why I am here!”

55:15.830 --> 55:17.499
Unluckily I know this!

55:17.499 --> 55:19.569
Unfortunately I know it!

55:19.569 --> 55:20.960
Now what to do?

55:20.960 --> 55:22.500
That I am supposed to do.

55:22.500 --> 55:24.950
Now you are supposed to do many things which
I cannot do.

55:24.950 --> 55:27.930
For example you can drive a car; I don’t
know anything about it.

55:27.930 --> 55:32.369
I don’t understand your economics, I don’t
understand your laws, I cannot understand

55:32.369 --> 55:36.190
anything that is supposed to be understood
by a normal human being.

55:36.190 --> 55:37.990
But I understand Kundalini.

55:37.990 --> 55:41.700
If you ask me to open an ordinary packet of
milk, I cannot!

55:41.700 --> 55:42.880
But I can open Kundalini.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.990
What to do now?

55:43.990 --> 55:45.320
I know that, so why should you feel so hurt
about it?

55:45.320 --> 55:50.400
It’s me who was supposed to do it.

55:50.400 --> 55:53.670
And that’s the only problem, if you can
overcome it.

55:53.670 --> 55:58.550
You know so many things and I don’t know
so many things, then there won’t be any

55:58.550 --> 56:00.789
problem of ego coming in between.

56:00.789 --> 56:06.880
If I have to, say, do something, fixing up
this, I’ll have to ask Douglas to do it.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.720
I do not know how to fix it.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.440
I may spoil it but I do not know how to use
it.

56:11.440 --> 56:14.579
So this is what it is, as simple as that.

56:14.579 --> 56:16.079
And this has to be done.

56:16.079 --> 56:17.609
It was all promised.

56:17.609 --> 56:18.900
I have to do it.

56:18.900 --> 56:20.690
All this time has been promised.

56:20.690 --> 56:22.190
All this happening has been promised.

56:22.190 --> 56:23.960
This is your right to get it.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.460
You’d better get it.

56:25.460 --> 56:30.530
And you cannot pay for it; no question [of
that].

56:30.530 --> 56:32.320
It’s an insult.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.329
It is love.

56:33.329 --> 56:34.329
It’s not mercenary.

56:34.329 --> 56:35.329
It is love.

56:35.329 --> 56:37.300
You cannot pay for it.

56:37.300 --> 56:38.460
You cannot purchase me.

56:38.460 --> 56:40.950
I am quite an illusion also.

56:40.950 --> 56:45.950
I mean, I can be quite tricky so be careful
about me.

56:45.950 --> 56:51.910
If you try to avoid me, I’ll avoid you hundred
times, and you’ll go out of circulation.

56:51.910 --> 56:56.299
So be careful, because I am not that simple
as I look.

56:56.299 --> 56:57.299
I am telling you beforehand, so be careful
about it.

56:57.299 --> 57:04.360
But still you will forget because I look so
simple, but I am not.

57:04.360 --> 57:13.099
I know so many things about you that I may
try to just avoid you and I may really get

57:13.099 --> 57:16.720
you out of circulation for some time, till
I have really sincere good people in here

57:16.720 --> 57:23.349
who get their Realisation, and then later
on we can try these people who have gone out

57:23.349 --> 57:24.349
of circulation.

57:24.349 --> 57:25.650
It works out that way.

57:25.650 --> 57:29.250
Many of time Sahaja yogis think that we have
very few people coming to Sahaja Yoga.

57:29.250 --> 57:31.599
I said, “That has to be because this is
real work."

57:31.599 --> 57:36.369
This is not that you become an organisation
member of somebody and you are certified,

57:36.369 --> 57:37.799
“All right, you are a Sahaja yogi."

57:37.799 --> 57:38.819
There is nothing like that.

57:38.819 --> 57:39.940
It has to happen.

57:39.940 --> 57:41.160
The Kundalini has to come.

57:41.160 --> 57:43.519
You have to feel the vibrations.

57:43.519 --> 57:44.519
It is a happening.

57:44.519 --> 57:45.519
Unless and until it happens you cannot give
false certificate.

57:45.519 --> 57:48.210
It’s not like plastic flowers, it is a real
flower.

57:48.210 --> 57:53.839
And for the real flower to come in, it takes
time, doesn’t matter.

57:53.839 --> 57:56.930
I mean we cannot give a false certificate.

57:56.930 --> 57:59.420
So the second thing that happens is emotional
thing.

57:59.420 --> 58:01.920
Third thing is spiritual.

58:01.920 --> 58:06.910
We can say that spiritually you understand
Sahaja Yoga.

58:06.910 --> 58:11.040
You understand what mistakes you have committed,
what wrong people you have been to.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.859
Immediately you understand.

58:12.859 --> 58:15.280
You find it out.

58:15.280 --> 58:21.380
And also you are told each and every secret:
how to do it, how to raise the Kundalini.

58:21.380 --> 58:22.380
You can raise Kundalini.

58:22.380 --> 58:25.490
Only if the Kundalini has crossed up to Agnya,
you can raise the Kundalini.

58:25.490 --> 58:32.700
As soon as you get your Realisation, you can
give Realisation to others because of [the]

58:32.700 --> 58:38.490
emergency: we have to give Realisation to
thousands and thousands and millions and millions.

58:38.490 --> 58:40.339
You can give Realisation to people.

58:40.339 --> 58:43.670
There are all these people have given Realisation.

58:43.670 --> 58:46.849
Not only that, you can cure people.

58:46.849 --> 58:54.720
And you can know as to how you are progressing:
where you are, what are the chakras, where

58:54.720 --> 58:58.890
they are placed on your fingers, where they
come, every thing you can know.

58:58.890 --> 59:01.529
It’s all inside not outside.

59:01.529 --> 59:04.280
And it should happen to all of you.

59:04.280 --> 59:07.440
After all I am here only for that job.

59:07.440 --> 59:12.920
I’ll work very hard, and I have been working
very hard, everyone knows that.

59:12.920 --> 59:16.049
But you have to also understand to co-operate
a little bit.

59:16.049 --> 59:17.049
Take your Realisation.

59:17.049 --> 59:20.450
After Realisation you will have to work hard
also.

59:20.450 --> 59:24.460
But before Realisation just leave it to people
who are realised.

59:24.460 --> 59:28.349
Like, when you don’t know swimming, it’s
better to leave it to people who know swimming.

59:28.349 --> 59:30.530
Once you learn swimming, you also teach others.

59:30.530 --> 59:33.250
There’s nothing like inferiority, superiority,
and all that.

59:33.250 --> 59:34.270
It’s not that.

59:34.270 --> 59:40.589
So just face it as simple people, not with
all this misidentification with ego.

59:40.589 --> 59:44.630
Now somebody was raising the Kundalini like
that, so one gentleman walked off, I said,

59:44.630 --> 59:45.630
“Why?”

59:45.630 --> 59:46.630
He said, “Why is he doing like this?”

59:46.630 --> 59:47.630
I said, “But you do not know."

59:47.630 --> 59:52.359
Supposing there is a person who is trying
to help you swimming, he puts his hand under

59:52.359 --> 59:55.430
your belly: you can get angry with that person,
“Why are you doing that?”

59:55.430 --> 59:56.630
I mean, he’s making you to float.

59:56.630 --> 59:58.289
But this is what it is.

59:58.289 --> 01:00:01.180
You do not know the technique which these
people know.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:06.080
You will also know the technique of Kundalini,
which is a living technique, because you are

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.080
not yet living.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.162
When you become realised, you will be knowing
because the power will flow from your hand.

01:00:11.162 --> 01:00:15.039
You can feel it on your hands, the cool breeze
flowing.

01:00:15.039 --> 01:00:23.329
But there’s only one warning to all our
western seekers, which I always give: that

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:27.980
you are great saints, I know you are seekers,
you are very genuine and you are honest, everything

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.980
is there.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:33.359
But you have one defect is that you think
about everything.

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:38.109
Even you have organised God, you have organised
about Him.

01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:42.839
You have already preconceived ideas about
Him — all this is there.

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:46.249
And anybody who tries to play some tricks
with you, you are very happy with that person

01:00:46.249 --> 01:00:49.099
and you are going along with that person very
nicely.

01:00:49.099 --> 01:00:54.559
But here it is you who has to know, it is
you who has to achieve, it is you who has

01:00:54.559 --> 01:00:55.559
to judge.

01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:59.029
Nobody is going to say that you are all right
unless and until you say you are all right.

01:00:59.029 --> 01:01:01.510
It is you who have to believe into it.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:06.980
So what happens that after Realisation the
Kundalini rises and She pierces this fontanel

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.150
bone area where you get your baptism.

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:13.690
You can even feel the cool breeze coming from
your head, actually you can feel it.

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:16.890
But then you forget the experience, you go
home and start thinking about it.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:20.651
As soon as you start thinking, the whole thing
comes down, because it is beyond thinking.

01:01:20.651 --> 01:01:25.500
The happening is beyond thinking: without
thinking it has happened.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.359
By thinking Kundalini doesn’t rise.

01:01:28.359 --> 01:01:30.980
So just allow it to work out.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:34.039
When it works out, you will be surprised [that]
it’s flowing.

01:01:34.039 --> 01:01:38.809
Supposing there is electricity coming and
the electricity comes in, you see the light

01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:39.809
flickering.

01:01:39.809 --> 01:01:43.910
If you start thinking about it, do you think
you’ll get back the light?

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:44.910
No!

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.900
You have to put the connection right.

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.680
It’s something like that.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.779
So thinking gives you ramblings, people are
lost [in that].

01:01:52.779 --> 01:01:53.779
Then they come back.

01:01:53.779 --> 01:01:58.300
And once, after Realisation if you lose it,
it takes time, it takes time.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.950
It’s a headache to me and headache to you.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.019
Many people do that way but please don’t
do it.

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:05.039
After all you are seekers of ages.

01:02:05.039 --> 01:02:09.630
Why should you waste your energy and time
and mine also.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.910
Be sensible and wise, get your Realisation
and get to it.

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.849
Give up all your misidentifications.

01:02:15.849 --> 01:02:17.410
All these are misidentifications.

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:22.779
And do not reach that point where you become
helpless and you have to give up these misidentifications.

01:02:22.779 --> 01:02:28.130
Because I told one person I told that, “Your
guru is not all right,” and he wouldn’t

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:30.069
believe me, because his Void was catching.

01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:33.099
Then he got epileptic, he got sick, then he
came to me.

01:02:33.099 --> 01:02:35.489
It took me three months to work on him.

01:02:35.489 --> 01:02:41.259
So the whole process of emancipation is slowed
down, and that’s how you pull down the forces

01:02:41.259 --> 01:02:42.259
of Divinity.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.970
There are so many things one can say.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:49.249
As you know there are lectures and lectures,
and Douglas has so many tapes and in London

01:02:49.249 --> 01:02:51.109
itself I have done so much.

01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:57.019
And to understand why London and why England,
you better read “Milton” by William Blake.

01:02:57.019 --> 01:03:03.309
He has prophesied all this that is going to
happen.

01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:06.359
That England is going to be the Jerusalem.

01:03:06.359 --> 01:03:10.609
That it is going to be the pilgrimage.

01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:13.089
It has described everything that is Sahaja
Yoga.

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:16.670
It’s a wonderful prophesy, you better read
it to understand.

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:20.160
It is even described where the ashram would
be in Lambeth Vale.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:27.369
It has described that first it will start
in Surrey Hills where I first came and stayed.

01:03:27.369 --> 01:03:31.934
And he has described in the end how the Virgin
Herself is going to work it out, how the Mother

01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:33.180
is going to work it.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.380
It’s all beautifully done.

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:39.259
So you had such a great poet like Blake, who
has already guided you.

01:03:39.259 --> 01:03:41.150
Better take guidance from them.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:46.720
Another is Shakespeare who was another great
realised-soul who showed the futility of nonsense

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.749
of this so-called romanticism and all this.

01:03:49.749 --> 01:03:52.480
So be sensible about it, be wise.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.770
You have a great heritage.

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:57.670
Your Stonehenge and all these things, I have
talked about it, what are these.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:01.720
This place has been worked out by many saints
before, and today you are born here.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.059
You are here to achieve your highest.

01:04:04.059 --> 01:04:06.599
There is a purpose behind it.

01:04:06.599 --> 01:04:13.960
As I said that England is the heart of the
universe, no doubt, it is the heart, that’s

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960
why I am here.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.510
I didn’t come as an immigrant or anything.

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:20.299
I came because my husband got elected to this
post and I came here.

01:04:20.299 --> 01:04:21.390
That was all organised.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:25.710
And I am just there because of that, and you’ll
be happy to know he has been re-elected again

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:29.829
for five years so I am going to be here five
years more.

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:35.000
And then England being the heart, we have
to be very careful because everything articulates

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.140
through heart, and the Spirit lives in the
heart.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:44.460
England is the heart, India is the Kundalini
and Europe is the liver.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:51.530
Now see the contradiction: Kundalini, where
Kundalini is in India people are sleeping.

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:55.819
Kundalini is sleeping; where Europe, where
the liver is, where the attention is, people

01:04:55.819 --> 01:05:00.890
are drunkards, they are drinking, the liver
is gone!

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:02.940
Where the heart is England, it is lethargic.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.250
Tell me now: what am I to do?

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:12.279
This is the situation in which we are, so
we have to rise to the occasion and achieve

01:05:12.279 --> 01:05:13.279
our goal.

01:05:13.279 --> 01:05:17.829
England is very important, very, very important,
and I am going to work very hard here, no

01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:18.829
doubt.

01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:26.599
But you all have to help me and understand
that the time has come now to get what you

01:05:26.599 --> 01:05:27.910
have been seeking.

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:36.180
All of you should achieve what you have been
seeking, right now.

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:41.720
May God Bless you.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.849
I would like you to ask me some questions.

01:05:43.849 --> 01:05:47.779
But don’t ask controversial questions like:
“I read in this book, that book…”

01:05:47.779 --> 01:05:51.849
Then somebody has been to some far-fetched
place, “What do you think of this guru and

01:05:51.849 --> 01:05:52.849
that guru?”

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:53.849
I am not going to get into controversies.

01:05:53.849 --> 01:06:03.190
So don’t ask me about any guru, you will
find out yourself.

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:06.940
Ask some sensible questions about Realisation.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:23.660
Seeker: If you feel yourself to be completely
blocked, if there’s nothing you can do.

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:28.119
What do you do?

01:06:28.119 --> 01:06:36.019
Shri Mataji: You leave it to me.

01:06:36.019 --> 01:06:38.380
I am quite a master in this.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.470
I have had all kinds of blocks: mountains
after mountains.

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:42.489
You don’t know how much I have gone through.

01:06:42.489 --> 01:06:44.930
I have become now an expert.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:54.609
You are not such a block, at least as far
as you are concerned, so don’t worry.

01:06:54.609 --> 01:06:56.819
You see, I have worked hard for years to study
all the permutations, combinations.

01:06:56.819 --> 01:07:03.260
I used to enter into the Kundalini and into
the…to find out what are the blockages.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.080
And I know how to find the way out.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.849
You just leave it to me.

01:07:09.849 --> 01:07:14.150
But later on when you get it, everything I
will tell you, every secret about it.

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:17.569
Everything I am going to tell you, and you
are going to become the master yourself.

01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:22.309
That’s what it is.

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:26.230
What kind of blockage you are fearing?

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:31.249
Seeker: Some kind of fear.

01:07:31.249 --> 01:07:39.289
Shri Mataji: Fear is very simple to conquer.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:43.910
You see, it is because of conditionings.

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:49.119
People are … I don’t know why they do
it, this I cannot explain.

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:50.579
Human beings are very difficult.

01:07:50.579 --> 01:07:54.789
Like in France they said, “Mother, if you
say you are a happy person, they’ll think

01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:55.789
you are naïve."

01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:56.789
I said, “Why?”

01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:59.220
“Because [they think] you do not know any
problems.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.880
So you have to be a very unhappy person.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.190
You have to show you are unhappy.

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:06.720
Your cheeks must go inside like this; you
must look absolutely like a prisoner of Ceylon."

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:07.720
I said, “Really?”

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:12.779
They said, “If you go like this, Mother,
in such a happy mood, they will never take

01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:13.779
you seriously!”

01:08:13.779 --> 01:08:16.720
I said, “But I don’t think."

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.180
They said, “We must suffer.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.150
That’s what they want."

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:23.100
I said, “But why?

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:27.310
Christ has suffered for you, now why do you
want to suffer?”

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:28.310
But they say these things.

01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:30.290
Actually you know, it is with these people
I have seen they say.

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:37.240
I said, “If it is so, you are people having
prostitutes on the streets, lined up together.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.930
You have pubs on the other side.

01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:42.522
You have gay, this thing and nonsensical things
all over.

01:08:42.522 --> 01:08:43.522
You are unhappy.

01:08:43.522 --> 01:08:47.260
You are making everybody extremely unhappy."

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:51.770
I said, “I am unhappy because I see this
kind of thing going on here, and you are saying

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:52.770
that you are unhappy.

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:56.250
You are not unhappy at all, you are just escaping
it."

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.650
Also so the fear is another sort of a conditioning
on you.

01:08:59.650 --> 01:09:05.380
It comes to you [such] that you think, “I
will have to lose something."

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.710
No, you blossom into something.

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:11.000
Because you are beautiful.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.590
I see that beauty and I see that Spirit and
you are that.

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:22.010
And the fear that you have is because you
cannot see it.

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:23.010
It’s just a conditioning.

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.010
You just blossom into it.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:26.640
Did you read any one of these horrible books
on Kundalini?

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.640
That’s it!

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.650
That’s very simple to overcome.

01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:33.960
I’ll tell you what: a villager comes to
the city, he has never seen electricity and

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.010
he puts his two fingers in the plug!

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:36.010
[It’s] like that.

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:37.010
They are absolutely unauthorised.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:40.310
You know, they do not know what Kundalini
is.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.270
I was amazed.

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:46.750
There’s a big book like that, and he says
the Kundalini is in the stomach!

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.990
I said, “Now what to do?”

01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:51.280
And he’s written a big book like that, you
see.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.600
They are naïve first of all, they are unauthorised,
they are unholy.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.610
Everybody cannot do Kundalini’s job.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:02.460
You have to be an authorised person from God
and you have to be holy person.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:08.140
Specially a gentleman, I know, who has written
a book, he leads such a horrible private life.

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.890
He’s such a money-minded fellow.

01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:14.170
He talks of Kundalini, I was surprised.

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:18.840
He’s taking money from everyone and he’s
leading such a horrible life and he’s spoiling

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.200
women and doing all kinds of things and raping
them.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.650
And he is telling that my Kundalini rose and
it troubled me like this, and it will.

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:30.210
Kundalini doesn’t trouble actually [it’s]
this Deity sitting there on the first chakra

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:31.230
– Shri Ganesha.

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:35.960
He is the Deity of innocence, who incarnated
as Jesus Christ.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:40.410
He only thrashes such people who try to handle
Kundalini.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:49.280
Even they try to put your innocence, which
looks after your sex onto the Mother.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.700
Just imagine what a sinful thing it is.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:58.720
Innocence is the one that is your special
power.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.270
That’s why people are not even spontaneous
now in sex.

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.900
They just think about it.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:17.390
Do you know the latest numbers of people who
are impotent in the West?

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:24.250
And do you know, in Switzerland itself, out
of five families only one family can produce

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:27.470
children – they are impotent.

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:31.610
If you think about sex, you can become impotent.

01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:36.450
All the spontaneity is lost.

01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.710
And here people are getting sophisticated
with it.

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:46.050
Either you become a rapist or you become absolutely
an impotent person.

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:51.120
Either you go the right or to the left.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:59.680
So these people who talk about Kundalini have
no sense of proportion, they have lead a very

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.300
bad life, they are unholy people.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.980
They have no sense of holiness, righteousness.

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.090
I mean righteousness is the thing.

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:11.020
When I talk of righteousness they think I
am a Victorian, you see.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:17.430
So I said, “I am not only Victorian, I am
even much earlier – I am ancient."

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:19.920
But that is what it is.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.340
But I do not say you become righteous or anything
— nothing out of the kind — because that’s

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.810
a difficult task.

01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:28.320
What I say you is you get your Realisation.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.730
[Then] automatically you will do it, automatically.

01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:33.350
Because the religion, what we call is the
religion or the righteousness gets enlightened

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.140
within you, [so] you just cannot do it.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.650
So I am not going to tell you.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.890
I said I am tricky.

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:39.220
I will just raise your Kundalini.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.890
You yourself will give up.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:45.410
I don’t say you give up your drugs, nothing,
but you just give up.

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:46.860
I don’t say you give up your drinks.

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.330
I do not say you give up your cigarettes.

01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:54.550
There are many who have given up completely
because they have found the absolute!

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:55.690
All right?

01:12:55.690 --> 01:13:00.550
In the same way your fears will also disappear
but do not think of them.

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:03.040
Just now you are sitting before a very powerful
person.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.580
Don’t you worry.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.730
Alright?

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:10.320
Is there any question?

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.710
One more, and then I will do the thing.

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:15.970
Anyone?

01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:30.650
Seeker: Mother, Mother, you mentioned about
emergency, what did you mean?

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:39.770
Shri Mataji: Are you already frightened?

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:43.600
I said ‘emergency’ because the Last Judgment
has started.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.300
In the atmosphere it is.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.740
No earthquakes for you, all right?

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:57.800
Can’t you see [that] there is emergency,
people want to have it, and you can feel the

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.050
emergency, everywhere there’s a talk about
it.

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:05.140
Everyone knows there is some sort of an atmosphere
of emergency.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:08.620
Everybody is running fast, nobody knows why.

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:17.020
You don’t worry, you are a realised-soul.

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:27.210
Emergency is that you give more Realisation
to East End (of London) people! (laughing)

01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:29.600
All right?

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.550
So, anymore, no, all right.

01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:52.540
Now, why I have asked you to ask questions,
that after this don’t ask any questions,

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.930
just have it.

01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:55.670
If you are hungry, you will just get it.

01:14:55.670 --> 01:15:05.540
And I would request you to put out your shoes
and put your feet on the ground.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.951
I don’t need really but I am just doing
it to please you people.

01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:09.951
It’s all right, I can manage.

01:15:09.951 --> 01:15:15.760
Because they will say, “Why don’t You
take out your shoes?” you know.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.480
All right, so, put your hands towards me,
straight like this, and you have to close

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.480
your eyes.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.410
That’s very important, that you must close
your eyes.

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:27.550
Now, why?

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:32.030
Because the Kundalini when it rises above
the Agnya, if your eyes are not closed, it

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:37.290
does not rise because there is dilatation
of the pupil that takes place, and it stops

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:38.980
there.

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:43.590
But maybe your eyes may be flickering possibly,
then you open your eyes and watch me.

01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:48.570
In case that they are not flickering, then
it’s all right.

01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:53.020
Now some of you may feel a little heat, and
if Sahaja yogis tell you something, you just

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.020
listen to them, don’t get angry with them.

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.020
It’s for your good.

01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:03.040
If they tell you to remove something or do
something, it’s better to listen to them.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:13.280
Just put both your hands towards me.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.870
Just like that.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:28.460
Just see if there is flickering in your eyes.

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:43.890
It’s a funny thing today: the centre you
are catching is Left Nabhi.

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:54.030
And you have to decide one thing that you
have to marry sometime because there are great

01:16:54.030 --> 01:17:11.020
souls who are to be born, and we have to give
them parents who are realised-souls.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:18.220
If you are not yet married just say that,
“Mother, we’ll marry,” that’s all.

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.560
It will work out.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:33.700
Still Left Nabhi is there.

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:39.601
Also the marriage institution has to be put
right because, if these great souls are to

01:17:39.601 --> 01:17:44.590
be born, we have to give them a nest, a family
where they are to be born.

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:50.670
Otherwise poor Indians will have to bear all
the children of the world!

01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:58.330
Because of this emergency many people are
taking birth, and they would not like to be

01:17:58.330 --> 01:18:03.510
born in a place where the parents are killing
the children or where the parents are quarrelling

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:05.690
among themselves and every day they are having
a divorce.

01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:10.830
So poor Indians they have to take the load
upon themselves.

01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:17.760
Marcus close your eyes.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:24.700
Close your eyes Linda.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:29.900
Close your eyes.

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:40.300
It doesn’t go over your Hamsa.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:45.510
Close your eyes.

01:18:45.510 --> 01:19:22.650
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.

01:19:22.650 --> 01:20:35.710
Void is there and Left Nabhi.
