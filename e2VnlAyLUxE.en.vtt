00:01.069 --> 00:07.680
Yesterday you all enjoyed the music and I
was very happy, at your enjoyment.

00:07.680 --> 00:17.220
Music plays a very dynamic role in human life,
one has to understand that.

00:17.220 --> 00:31.240
One of the mysteries I was describing to you,
last time, also, created by naad, they call

00:31.240 --> 00:35.570
it ‘naad’, you can say the logos or the
first sound, the Om, the Brahma.

00:35.570 --> 00:43.110
The sound, first time, the sound that was
created, when the Primordial Mother, or the

00:43.110 --> 00:48.989
Primordial Power, of Divine Love, the Power
of God, separated from God Himself.

00:48.989 --> 01:00.500
God was the Witness; Witness of the Play of
the Divine Power.

01:00.500 --> 01:06.770
There is no difference between the two.

01:06.770 --> 01:14.240
God Almighty, and His Power are just like
the sun and his rays.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.580
For us, for human beings, this is impossible
to conceive the mystery.

01:18.580 --> 01:27.560
Moreover, in our ego, we think that we can
understand Him, is another mystery for me.

01:27.560 --> 01:37.369
But, to me it’s a very sweet thing to see
human beings trying to comprehend the mystery

01:37.369 --> 01:38.729
of God.

01:38.729 --> 01:46.700
It’s like a little child trying to understand
the table work of his father; or could be

01:46.700 --> 01:51.649
much more.

01:51.649 --> 01:58.240
But this sound, the first sound, which is
described as also ‘logos’ I believe, is

01:58.240 --> 02:11.470
the sound of this Primordial Power, of this
Divine Power, that has created the whole universe.

02:11.470 --> 02:15.970
Now one may say that, “How are we to believe
that this sound exists?” Of course, one

02:15.970 --> 02:17.250
should not believe.

02:17.250 --> 02:22.110
But whether you believe or not, it exists!
So why not discover it.

02:22.110 --> 02:25.280
Instead of discarding something, why not discover
it?

02:25.280 --> 02:28.180
Is a better way of looking at things.

02:28.180 --> 02:37.950
You should keep yourself absolutely open,
and see for yourself if it is true or not.

02:37.950 --> 02:42.390
For any scientific man, it is important to
be an open-minded person.

02:42.390 --> 02:50.360
If he is bound by some traditional ideas or
some sort of old-fashioned ideas or some sort

02:50.360 --> 02:58.220
of hypocritical ideas, or fanatical ideas,
such a person cannot be a scientist.

02:58.220 --> 03:08.100
For any scientist it is important to be a
very open-minded man, objective and not subjective.

03:08.100 --> 03:22.760
You remain subjectively very controversial
when you are not Self-realised.

03:22.760 --> 03:25.590
Before that every subject is a different subject.

03:25.590 --> 03:32.810
Someone likes a blue colour, someone like
a red colour, someone likes a green colour.

03:32.810 --> 03:36.730
Someone likes to eat ice cream, someone likes
to eat something else.

03:36.730 --> 03:38.490
Everybody is a different person subjectively.

03:38.490 --> 03:46.030
Some person like a blonde lady, someone likes
with the dark hair, and everybody has a different

03:46.030 --> 03:47.030
idea.

03:47.030 --> 03:55.620
There’s nothing like absolute among people,
naturally, because they have not reached their

03:55.620 --> 03:57.030
absolute.

03:57.030 --> 04:00.640
So you are absolutely subjective.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.910
For music or for anything, whatever you like,
is all subjective – colours.

04:03.910 --> 04:14.170
I was watching a TV for interior decoration
once and I was amazed the colours they used,

04:14.170 --> 04:16.620
were so fantastic, so beautiful.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.620
I liked them very much myself, but I had some
other people watching they said, “Horrid!

04:20.620 --> 04:29.000
They are absolutely horrid!” I said, “Then
what colours you would like?” “Something

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
grey."

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Really?

04:31.000 --> 04:34.350
“Or something pale or insipid."

04:34.350 --> 04:41.720
They didn’t mean insipid but the colours
they liked were insipid according to me.

04:41.720 --> 04:47.520
Because if you enter into a room with that
kind of insipid thing, I mean you would really

04:47.520 --> 04:54.230
recoil back thinking, “Oh God what sort
of people are living here?” But the ideas

04:54.230 --> 04:59.070
have changed quite a lot that people now think
of warmth.

04:59.070 --> 05:04.660
I mean naturally they have avoided many colours
which are not warm, which are dull.

05:04.660 --> 05:10.210
But still it is subjective depending on the
conditioning of people.

05:10.210 --> 05:17.280
I mean for example Indians like a particular
type of colours and English like another type;

05:17.280 --> 05:19.800
everyone likes different.

05:19.800 --> 05:25.640
So some absolute has to be found out.

05:25.640 --> 05:30.950
So everything that is subjective is useless
for a scientist, no doubt, but scientists

05:30.950 --> 05:34.510
have not reached their absolute either.

05:34.510 --> 05:42.120
What they know as absolute also turns out
to be not that – whatever law is said now.

05:42.120 --> 05:54.030
They said that everything moves, and goes
on moving, like Newton’s Law was; but Einstein

05:54.030 --> 05:56.210
challenged it.

05:56.210 --> 06:01.310
Some said that the things are made of atoms,
then they came out with another theory saying,

06:01.310 --> 06:04.040
“No, it’s made of molecules."

06:04.040 --> 06:14.520
So you are also discovering something, challenging
it, checking it, and understanding it.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.720
Whatever looks today the truth, may not look
the truth tomorrow.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.990
So this is not truth.

06:18.990 --> 06:22.240
If the truth is changing, it cannot be the
truth.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.730
There’s something illusory about the whole
thing because what you think today as the

06:27.730 --> 06:29.580
truth doesn’t remain as the truth tomorrow.

06:29.580 --> 06:36.050
So there’s some sort of an illusion that
is working in between.

06:36.050 --> 06:42.150
Something you like in childhood, you may not
like it in your old age.

06:42.150 --> 06:46.330
It’s all the time changing.

06:46.330 --> 06:55.870
The subjective mood depends on so many things:
your family, your treatment, your childhood,

06:55.870 --> 07:02.450
your parents, your relations, the country
you are born in, the culture you are brought

07:02.450 --> 07:03.639
up in.

07:03.639 --> 07:10.850
Everything gives you this personality which
has that subjective feelings or subjective

07:10.850 --> 07:11.850
understanding.

07:11.850 --> 07:18.210
Now the science confuses, confuses more when
you see that whatever we have produced through

07:18.210 --> 07:21.590
science has not given us joy.

07:21.590 --> 07:31.230
Our hearts have become just like stones and
we have created devils and devils and devils:

07:31.230 --> 07:36.370
like atom bombs and hydrogen bombs and this
and that, and now we are frightened of them

07:36.370 --> 07:41.200
and we are fighting, “No more hydrogen bombs!”
and “No more nuclear things!” and “We

07:41.200 --> 07:46.320
don’t want nuclear weapons!” Who has created
them?

07:46.320 --> 07:49.650
You have created them and now you are against
it.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.800
Human beings are wonderful.

07:51.800 --> 07:57.680
They create something, and then they create
an organisation against it.

07:57.680 --> 08:03.270
It’s rather wasteful I think to go about
like this.

08:03.270 --> 08:07.290
First you build up yourself and knock it down.

08:07.290 --> 08:11.330
Then again build up something else and knock
it down.

08:11.330 --> 08:16.350
It’s very frustrating and one feels so puzzled
and confused.

08:16.350 --> 08:19.070
But truth is never confused.

08:19.070 --> 08:21.240
Truth remains the truth.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.880
It never changes.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.140
It is absolute – it is nitya.

08:26.140 --> 08:28.170
It is never changed.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.820
It remains the same.

08:30.820 --> 08:36.800
It may manifest in different forms but it
never changes.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.100
And what is the truth?

08:39.100 --> 08:42.260
What is the truth?

08:42.260 --> 08:50.020
In very simple words, what is truth – that
God loves us.

08:50.020 --> 08:52.210
This is the truth.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.730
That He created us because He loved us.

08:54.730 --> 08:59.740
It is His love that has created us.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.100
He looks after us.

09:01.100 --> 09:04.770
He protects us.

09:04.770 --> 09:05.770
He guides us.

09:05.770 --> 09:12.650
He gives us our evolution as a human being
and then He gives us a higher status, higher

09:12.650 --> 09:17.920
consciousness by which we know His powers
and the powers flow through you – [this]

09:17.920 --> 09:19.300
is the truth.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.030
This does not change.

09:22.030 --> 09:25.970
At monkey stage the truth was there, at human
stage the truth is there.

09:25.970 --> 09:31.520
Whether you are a drunkard or a sinner or
a saint, the truth remains that God loves

09:31.520 --> 09:32.520
you.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.070
He may punish you in His love – that’s
a different point.

09:34.070 --> 09:38.980
He may be angry with you in His love, but
He loves you.

09:38.980 --> 09:39.980
Loves what?

09:39.980 --> 09:47.150
What does He love in you is your Spirit.

09:47.150 --> 09:48.930
The Spirit in you that sparkles.

09:48.930 --> 09:50.710
He sees that spirit.

09:50.710 --> 09:52.440
He tries to bring it out.

09:52.440 --> 10:01.310
For example, you see a diamond, and you see
that it is lying in the mud – you lift it

10:01.310 --> 10:03.300
from the mud.

10:03.300 --> 10:11.210
You clean it, wipe it, chisel it, and make
a beautiful diamond out of it.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.240
Anything that is created has had to go through
some processes.

10:14.240 --> 10:19.680
In the same way, you have gone through your
evolutionary process.

10:19.680 --> 10:24.740
But with what delicacy, with what understanding,
with what love!

10:24.740 --> 10:34.220
Imagine, supposing you have to become a monkey
suddenly, how would it be?

10:34.220 --> 10:37.760
Very painful! Won’t it be?

10:37.760 --> 10:40.600
And extremely embarrassing too.

10:40.600 --> 10:47.180
(laughter) But we have come out of monkeys
as they say, supposing we have.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.460
Then, it has happened without our knowledge,

10:50.460 --> 10:52.680
without any embarrassment.

10:52.680 --> 10:57.529
I mean imagine a monkey suddenly becoming
a human being losing his tail, he must be

10:57.529 --> 11:03.540
feeling quite nervous about the whole stuff!
That he cannot jump from trees to tree, he

11:03.540 --> 11:06.240
cannot behave like the monkeys do.

11:06.240 --> 11:10.020
I mean it’s rather difficult, isn’t it?

11:10.020 --> 11:17.270
And to create this beautiful thing called
as human beings, without any pressure on him,

11:17.270 --> 11:21.710
without any effort on him, without any money
load.

11:21.710 --> 11:26.610
Because these days interest rates are very
high up! God knows, if He had charged you

11:26.610 --> 11:32.210
money like the gurus are charging you, to
become human beings from monkeys to this stage

11:32.210 --> 11:36.470
I don’t know how much you would have paid
off!

11:36.470 --> 11:47.530
That’s the thing is that He loves us and
you can’t understand His love, that His

11:47.530 --> 11:48.880
love is His own satisfaction.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.820
He loves you because He enjoys His love.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.990
His nature is to love.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.710
That gives Him completeness.

11:57.710 --> 12:01.130
That gives Him His own meaning.

12:01.130 --> 12:03.410
That is His play.

12:03.410 --> 12:05.690
That is His joy.

12:05.690 --> 12:09.170
And that’s the only Truth.

12:09.170 --> 12:14.120
Everything may change in this world but that
Truth remains.

12:14.120 --> 12:20.220
If you have this faith within you – that
He loves you – despite the fact that you

12:20.220 --> 12:21.390
have had bad problems.

12:21.390 --> 12:27.230
It’s all human beings who create problems
for you, God doesn’t create any problem

12:27.230 --> 12:28.230
for you.

12:28.230 --> 12:31.150
You do not know how much He looks after you.

12:31.150 --> 12:37.830
How many problems you have created for Him
so that there is a barrier between His grace

12:37.830 --> 12:38.830
and you.

12:38.830 --> 12:46.850
People have created mountains and mountains
between Him and themselves! They don’t want

12:46.850 --> 12:48.170
to have Him.

12:48.170 --> 12:57.440
He’s there to pour down all that He has
and here such a big balloon of an ego carrying

12:57.440 --> 13:09.589
you through without receiving a single drop
of that grace.

13:09.589 --> 13:20.520
So, we have to understand, that we are still
children, and children have to behave like

13:20.520 --> 13:22.330
children.

13:22.330 --> 13:24.510
Not to say that we know everything.

13:24.510 --> 13:43.220
Actually you don’t know anything, I would
say, till you

13:43.220 --> 13:47.620
have got your Realisation.

13:47.620 --> 13:55.900
His love never changes.

13:55.900 --> 14:04.089
Then His love is victorious – victorious.

14:04.089 --> 14:13.240
It surpasses all the efforts of human beings
to lose it.

14:13.240 --> 14:22.000
Everything we do, everything that is possible
under the sun, to make Him unhappy, frustrated,

14:22.000 --> 14:23.880
angry with us.

14:23.880 --> 14:31.170
Whatever good He does to people, they will
turn it into something nonsensical.

14:31.170 --> 14:37.940
Say for example, give them money: let them
have some Lakshmi’s prasad is to, let them

14:37.940 --> 14:43.650
have some money, some well-being, materially
– that’s the best way to ruin people.

14:43.650 --> 14:48.940
Give them money and they’re out for breaking
their heads.

14:48.940 --> 14:54.510
Absolutely! You give them the power.

14:54.510 --> 15:03.589
Any power you give them, political, economic
and other sorts of, social – finished! They

15:03.589 --> 15:08.140
know how to break themselves, completely destroy
themselves.

15:08.140 --> 15:18.250
The whole wisdom works out at destroying your
attention and your holiness and your innocence,

15:18.250 --> 15:27.110
your beautiful being that has been created
with such, tender care and love.

15:27.110 --> 15:32.390
This is supposed to be ‘freedom’ you know,
– liberated.

15:32.390 --> 15:46.450
With this kind of mess it’s rather difficult
to make the children understand that you are

15:46.450 --> 15:49.400
destroying yourself so they have to have some
shocks.

15:49.400 --> 15:55.140
You tell a child, “Don’t put your finger
in the plug!” But if you say, “Don’t

15:55.140 --> 15:56.860
put!” Then that must go.

15:56.860 --> 16:07.579
It’s a sort of a worm in the head! “Oh,
they have said not to put?

16:07.579 --> 16:11.829
We must!” So they will put the fingers in
there.

16:11.829 --> 16:13.990
You said, “Don’t put it!” – still.

16:13.990 --> 16:17.710
Then again you say, “Don’t put it!”
Still.

16:17.710 --> 16:25.680
Then you say, “Alright, go ahead!” And
then they get a shock! It can be serious,

16:25.680 --> 16:28.620
but what to do?

16:28.620 --> 16:33.519
They don’t want to listen to you.

16:33.519 --> 16:38.100
I can understand children [being like that]
and some very old people are like that, I

16:38.100 --> 16:41.700
have had very funny experiences of old people
also.

16:41.700 --> 16:45.200
We had a gentleman here, a High Commissioner,
long time back.

16:45.200 --> 16:51.260
Indian people have a speciality in appointing
very old people as Ambassadors – shaking.

16:51.260 --> 16:56.959
I don’t know! Americans also do that.

16:56.959 --> 17:05.429
And this gentleman was standing next to another
gentleman whom we knew very well you see,

17:05.429 --> 17:08.330
so we went there and he said, “Meet Mr Gupta."

17:08.330 --> 17:13.269
I said, “Look at that! This fellow’s name
is something else.

17:13.269 --> 17:22.819
Say his name was Varma for example.

17:22.819 --> 17:25.939
So he says, “Sir, I’m sorry, my name is
Mr Varma."

17:25.939 --> 17:28.879
He said, “What did you say?

17:28.879 --> 17:34.159
You mean I said wrong?” He said, “Not
that sir, but my name is Varma."

17:34.159 --> 17:37.190
So another fellow comes in.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.960
He says, “Please meet Mr Gupta."

17:38.960 --> 17:42.869
He says, “Sir, I’m sorry my name is Varma."

17:42.869 --> 17:47.149
He said, “Do you mean to say I’m telling
it wrong?

17:47.149 --> 17:51.620
What do you mean by this?” “But sir but
my real name is Varma.

17:51.620 --> 17:52.620
Everyone knows me."

17:52.620 --> 17:58.040
“Doesn’t matter! Do you mean I am telling
you wrong names?” Then another fellow comes

17:58.040 --> 17:59.040
in.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.879
He says, “Now meet Mr Gupta."

18:02.879 --> 18:05.789
So the gentleman says, “But I know him,
he’s not Gupta, he’s Varma.

18:05.789 --> 18:09.419
How do you say Varma?” “But because I
say he’s Gupta, you see."

18:09.419 --> 18:22.389
In the same way [if] the children are obstinate
it’s alright but what about the in-betweens?

18:22.389 --> 18:31.780
The people who are grown-up, who are mature,
who do not suffer from senile decay, who are

18:31.780 --> 18:43.200
supposed to be sensible, at the helm of affairs,
very responsible people – you see them and

18:43.200 --> 18:49.730
you don’t know whether to put them as children
or senile, where they stand.

18:49.730 --> 18:55.629
One can’t understand their obstinacy and
their stupidity! The way they deny all that

18:55.629 --> 19:05.710
is Divine, all that is beautiful and just
run headlong, towards ugliness and unholy

19:05.710 --> 19:07.859
things, inauspicious.

19:07.859 --> 19:15.789
And then they end up with something tremendous
that has no chance for them to return.

19:15.789 --> 19:21.019
Something horrifyingly powerful that engulfs
them.

19:21.019 --> 19:30.049
So, for us it is necessary to understand,
basically when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you

19:30.049 --> 19:32.549
must have your wisdom intact.

19:32.549 --> 19:38.679
If you have no wisdom it’s going to be very
difficult.

19:38.679 --> 19:43.250
I mean I have seen people, walking out of
lunatic asylums and coming to Sahaja Yoga

19:43.250 --> 19:46.179
because the door is open to anyone who wants
to come in.

19:46.179 --> 19:47.700
It’s free too.

19:47.700 --> 19:52.149
I mean anyone who has no place to go anywhere,
they come round here, or they go to some cinema

19:52.149 --> 19:55.720
show, they didn’t get the tickets can come
and sit down here also, for seeing.

19:55.720 --> 20:03.519
There could be all kinds of people coming
down from all kinds of places but, though

20:03.519 --> 20:20.519
Sahaja Yoga opens doors to everyone, how much
do you open your doors to Sahaja Yoga is more

20:20.519 --> 20:21.519
important.

20:21.519 --> 20:27.330
That is what is wanted, is the wisdom.

20:27.330 --> 20:38.210
Wisdom to understand that, we have not found
the Truth, and we have to find it.

20:38.210 --> 20:40.559
And that must happen to you.

20:40.559 --> 20:43.960
There cannot be any brain-washing about it.

20:43.960 --> 20:52.859
There’s no other way, but the actual happening,
the becoming.

20:52.859 --> 20:58.840
That has to take place.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.549
But you cannot demand anything here.

21:01.549 --> 21:04.580
No! It’s a humble asking for that happening.

21:04.580 --> 21:07.749
You have to ask for it.

21:07.749 --> 21:20.270
It is, to be judged, by your Kundalini awakening:
how much time you will take, how far you can

21:20.270 --> 21:21.270
go.

21:21.270 --> 21:22.720
Without that, we just can’t say.

21:22.720 --> 21:27.799
You see, there are people, “Can you give
me realisation in five minutes Mother?”

21:27.799 --> 21:29.789
On the phone I hear the voice.

21:29.789 --> 21:37.470
I hear the vibrations! Oh God! I said, “Can
you come tomorrow?” “Then will You give

21:37.470 --> 21:47.049
me in five minutes?” I said, “Then can
you come day after?” I know I can’t give

21:47.049 --> 22:01.419
him in five years! Because vibrations are
horrid! I have to work, I have to work for

22:01.419 --> 22:02.500
that person.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.669
Then he calls me.

22:04.669 --> 22:08.460
I said, “Come along today my child."

22:08.460 --> 22:11.179
“Mother, give me my realisation."

22:11.179 --> 22:12.179
– it works out.

22:12.179 --> 22:17.190
It’s the attitude [that is] very important.

22:17.190 --> 22:18.509
If you have [an] aggressive attitude Sahaja
Yoga doesn’t work out.

22:18.509 --> 22:19.509
You are all welcome.

22:19.509 --> 22:31.279
You are welcome in my heart, there where the
rebirth takes place, no doubt.

22:31.279 --> 22:41.460
But
you should value the love of God, and should

22:41.460 --> 22:43.659
know that He loves you.

22:43.659 --> 22:51.179
And you have to be humble to receive it: that
the grace should flow on you that, you should

22:51.179 --> 22:53.470
be gracious to receive it.

22:53.470 --> 22:59.190
Imagine you go to some place as a guest, and
there a big dinner is laid down, and you go

22:59.190 --> 23:04.979
and with a big thump on the table and you
say, “How dare you do this!” Then they’ll

23:04.979 --> 23:09.690
say, “Some lunatic has walked in!” They’ll
say “Oh, get out!” That’s exactly what

23:09.690 --> 23:12.809
happens to many people who come down to us.

23:12.809 --> 23:20.899
In Sahaja Yoga you have to have a balanced
– sainyata – balanced wisdom.

23:20.899 --> 23:25.519
Wisdom that gives you a balance.

23:25.519 --> 23:36.980
If you keep that for a month I am sure you
will establish yourself fully and it will

23:36.980 --> 23:38.799
work out.

23:38.799 --> 23:44.259
It’s your own, it’s for yourself.

23:44.259 --> 23:45.259
You have to have it.

23:45.259 --> 23:51.390
You have every right to have it.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.450
Agreed.

23:52.450 --> 24:03.080
Everything is yours but you have to have a
little patience with yourself and respect

24:03.080 --> 24:05.249
and attention.

24:05.249 --> 24:13.539
This is very important.

24:13.539 --> 24:25.130
Then this brahmanaad I was talking about,
this Omkara, is made of three powers within

24:25.130 --> 24:31.009
us A U M, and these three powers are called
as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati in

24:31.009 --> 24:32.009
Sahaja Yoga.

24:32.009 --> 24:34.570
These are the three powers that exist within
us.

24:34.570 --> 24:40.729
Mahakali power is on the left-hand side, as
you see, which comes from the right, comes

24:40.729 --> 24:44.289
down, is the power of desire.

24:44.289 --> 24:51.779
Right-hand side power, called as Mahasaraswati,
comes from the left to the right, and the

24:51.779 --> 25:07.899
central one is the one called as the Mahalakshmi
power which gives you your evolution.

25:07.899 --> 25:13.519
So you have a left-sided power, which is called
as Mahakali’s is the power of desire, the

25:13.519 --> 25:20.319
right side one is the power of action, and
the central one is the power of evolution

25:20.319 --> 25:25.330
– the third one, the centre one.

25:25.330 --> 25:36.529
The centre one, is the one that has created
you into a human being.

25:36.529 --> 25:39.499
This is the subtle power within us.

25:39.499 --> 25:45.440
But we have expressed them in the gross, that
the left and right sympathetic nervous system,

25:45.440 --> 25:49.279
are expressed by left and right-sided power.

25:49.279 --> 25:56.080
And the parasympathetic nervous system is
expressing the central path, called as sushumna

25:56.080 --> 26:02.580
– as far as we have achieved in our human
awareness.

26:02.580 --> 26:06.070
So in our human awareness we have reached
a particular point.

26:06.070 --> 26:18.039
To go beyond this, is the modern problem is
the latest, the extra, what do you call that

26:18.039 --> 26:19.039
– ultra-modern.

26:19.039 --> 26:26.399
Ultra-modern problem is how to raise our consciousness
to that point where we become one with our

26:26.399 --> 26:28.440
Selves, with our Spirit.

26:28.440 --> 26:34.649
Otherwise you have no meaning, no meaning
to your life.

26:34.649 --> 26:37.809
You don’t know why you exist.

26:37.809 --> 26:46.659
You may go to a hundred places, do what you
like, you have to find out your Self.

26:46.659 --> 26:50.119
And that is done by the power within you called
as ‘Kundalini’ which rests in the triangular

26:50.119 --> 26:59.029
bone, in the coccyx, in three and a half coils,
and it rises through all these centres, six,

26:59.029 --> 27:08.549
which are placed above it, and gives you your
baptism; where the Kundalini breaks through

27:08.549 --> 27:13.879
this point, called as ‘brahmarandhra’
in the fontanel bone area.

27:13.879 --> 27:20.090
And you achieve that, you become that – that
collective being – so that you start feeling

27:20.090 --> 27:28.979
a cool breeze flowing in your hands and feeling
the different centres.

27:28.979 --> 27:31.419
It’s the becoming.

27:31.419 --> 27:36.250
And the whole system starts changing, the
priorities start changing and you start seeing

27:36.250 --> 27:39.279
the working of the Divine Power.

27:39.279 --> 27:43.799
That is love.

27:43.799 --> 27:48.950
Not the love that we understand [which] is
limited but love that is emitting all the

27:48.950 --> 27:50.869
time, ceaselessly.

27:50.869 --> 27:58.090
The love that knows, the love that loves,
the love that coordinates and cooperates and

27:58.090 --> 28:00.479
runs this whole world.

28:00.479 --> 28:01.750
That’s the Truth.

28:01.750 --> 28:07.120
The rest is all falsehood, is all illusion.

28:07.120 --> 28:12.970
It’s that Power managing everything in this
world.

28:12.970 --> 28:18.279
The rest of it is all a fake.

28:18.279 --> 28:21.899
That’s what you have to achieve.

28:21.899 --> 28:28.789
That’s how I hope you are here.

28:28.789 --> 28:29.789
May God bless you all

28:29.789 --> 28:30.789
Now.

28:30.789 --> 28:31.789
Any questions?

28:31.789 --> 28:38.639
I am sorry I am taking tea and you are not
taking the tea!

28:38.639 --> 28:42.070
Any questions please?

28:42.070 --> 28:44.359
Any questions?

28:44.359 --> 28:47.289
Thoughtless! The Kundalini has risen above
this.

28:47.289 --> 28:48.519
You cannot think of a question.

28:48.519 --> 28:49.519
That’s the first trick I do.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.519
Kundalini has risen over.

28:50.519 --> 28:53.200
Because thinking is a horrid thing! You don’t
know where you go, like an octopus here, there,

28:53.200 --> 28:54.200
there, what you gather.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.269
Yogi: Mother would you please vibrate some
lemons and chilies for me?

28:57.269 --> 28:58.269
(laughter)

28:58.269 --> 28:59.399
Shri Mataji: What is it my son?

28:59.399 --> 29:01.159
Yogini: He’s asking Mother if you will vibrate
some lemons and chillies.

29:01.159 --> 29:02.710
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course.

29:02.710 --> 29:03.739
That I will do.

29:03.739 --> 29:04.739
Not just now.

29:04.739 --> 29:06.100
Just wait, I will do it later.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.899
Let me give them Realisation first.

29:07.899 --> 29:08.899
That’s very interesting.

29:08.899 --> 29:09.899
That’s another mystery.

29:09.899 --> 29:12.630
We have a new relationship in our family and
there was a doctor, and his wife has been

29:12.630 --> 29:15.600
sick for the last eight years and she’s
very nervous and she’s having lots of problems,

29:15.600 --> 29:16.600
this, that.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.909
So I told her, “Alright you get some lemon
and chilies I’ll vibrate it, and they’ll

29:19.909 --> 29:20.960
work it out."

29:20.960 --> 29:22.009
She said, “What?

29:22.009 --> 29:23.719
I’ve paid so much to the psychologist.

29:23.719 --> 29:28.599
I’ve been to this place and that place!”
I said, “Only I need lemon and chilies but

29:28.599 --> 29:29.710
you have to pay for it.

29:29.710 --> 29:32.029
I can’t pay for that!” She said, “Alright."

29:32.029 --> 29:33.779
I said, “Now you try me."

29:33.779 --> 29:34.940
So she brought it.

29:34.940 --> 29:39.590
In India it’s very cheap you know, lemon
and chilies.

29:39.590 --> 29:41.120
I vibrated and gave it to her.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.289
Next day she came up.

29:43.289 --> 29:45.020
“Oh God, what’s happened?

29:45.020 --> 29:46.320
I’m perfectly alright.

29:46.320 --> 29:49.629
What did you do with the lemon chilies?

29:49.629 --> 29:54.440
What has happened, what’s the mystery?”
But her husband is a very fine man, a doctor.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.210
He said, “What is this?

29:56.210 --> 29:57.269
What is this magic?

29:57.269 --> 29:58.590
What have you done?

29:58.590 --> 30:04.379
I couldn’t get this wife of mine cured all
these days! We did every thing, operations,

30:04.379 --> 30:05.379
this that.

30:05.379 --> 30:16.879
How these lemon, chilies have cured?” I
said, “Now I’ll not tell you but later

30:16.879 --> 30:17.899
on."

30:17.899 --> 30:20.929
Such simple things.

30:20.929 --> 30:33.110
That’s the mystery.

30:33.110 --> 30:34.169
The vibrations: same thing.

30:34.169 --> 30:38.230
In Sahaja Yoga some things will sound very
strange to people.

30:38.230 --> 30:42.309
For example when they give a bandhan to their
aura.

30:42.309 --> 30:46.620
When they try to move their hands.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.230
Because from the hand, the power is flowing
you see.

30:49.230 --> 30:54.869
So you put, a bondage to your aura, so that
nothing negative comes to you.

30:54.869 --> 30:59.539
You see like this.

30:59.539 --> 31:04.320
Indians may understand it but not in the West.

31:04.320 --> 31:11.070
But I am sure [that] when Christ used to do
like this, in the beginning, most of the people

31:11.070 --> 31:13.249
must be laughing at it.

31:13.249 --> 31:17.250
Not understanding what all this is.

31:17.250 --> 31:21.879
Or when they started doing namaz.

31:21.879 --> 31:24.009
Now everybody’s doing namaz.

31:24.009 --> 31:30.470
Specially in London I think we are all becoming
Arabic! That suits us better.

31:30.470 --> 31:36.099
I was surprised that there are schools and
schools for all the executives to learn Arabic

31:36.099 --> 31:37.289
now.

31:37.289 --> 31:43.269
It’s the money religion started.

31:43.269 --> 31:48.639
And when Mohammed Sahib started this thing,
I mean, everybody used to make fun of him.

31:48.639 --> 31:54.070
It’s complete Kundalini jagruti! Namaz is
nothing but Kundalini jagruti it is.

31:54.070 --> 31:55.549
But these Muslims do they know?

31:55.549 --> 31:58.460
Or those who laugh at them?

31:58.460 --> 31:59.460
Nobody knows.

31:59.460 --> 32:04.820
Both are in the same boat, because one are
doing blindly and another are just laughing

32:04.820 --> 32:06.129
at them blindly, again.

32:06.129 --> 32:11.239
Now the Hindus when they do puja and aarti
do they know what they are doing?

32:11.239 --> 32:14.659
They don’t know! They do it because traditionally
they have been doing it.

32:14.659 --> 32:17.320
They don’t know how they are giving bandhan.

32:17.320 --> 32:22.340
They don’t know what they are doing, what
is this movement is, nothing they know.

32:22.340 --> 32:26.239
But traditionally they are doing it.

32:26.239 --> 32:31.080
Whatever it is all these things have meanings.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.659
In Sahaja Yoga you know the meanings of everything.

32:35.659 --> 32:42.330
The meaning of these Incarnations like Prophets,
like Krishna, Rama, Christ, Mohammed, Moses,

32:42.330 --> 32:45.159
every one has a great meaning in our lives.

32:45.159 --> 32:49.909
All that you discover after coming to Sahaja
Yoga, not before that.

32:49.909 --> 32:54.139
Before Realisation nothing can be understood.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.109
But once you know, you know.

32:57.109 --> 33:01.179
Those who do not know should not laugh at
people who know.

33:01.179 --> 33:08.009
On the contrary they should try to know and
then laugh at them.

33:08.009 --> 33:20.149
Then they won’t! Then they respect each
other and love each other.

33:20.149 --> 33:21.609
No questions there?

33:21.609 --> 33:29.320
Seeker: I would like to ask a question actually.

33:29.320 --> 33:40.679
I got my Kundalini awakened by another guru
and I’ve been doing sadhana, but I feel

33:40.679 --> 33:50.340
like I’ve reached some kind of blockage
and we’re not taught how to overcome these

33:50.340 --> 33:56.330
blockages at all and I just don’t know what
I could do.

33:56.330 --> 33:57.330
Shri Mataji: How can they tell?

33:57.330 --> 33:58.330
Seeker: They told to just keep doing more.

33:58.330 --> 34:00.379
Shri Mataji: You see, that’s the trouble
with all of them.

34:00.379 --> 34:05.593
Naturally they have to keep some sort of a
detective story going on isn’t it, to sell

34:05.593 --> 34:06.820
in the market.

34:06.820 --> 34:13.790
They ‘know’, but they don’t tell you,
then why do you want to listen to them?

34:13.790 --> 34:14.790
You should not.

34:14.790 --> 34:16.710
You should ask them, “Please tell us."

34:16.710 --> 34:18.500
For example somebody says, “We can fly."

34:18.500 --> 34:21.310
“Alright, you fly for us!” You should
ask.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.419
Nobody has said so far.

34:23.419 --> 34:29.169
Why don’t you write letters to this gentleman
who’s teaching you ‘flying’.

34:29.169 --> 34:33.510
Tell him to drop himself from Leaning Tower
of Pisa.

34:33.510 --> 34:36.649
(laughter) Yes, good idea! To all of them.

34:36.649 --> 34:40.960
You see those who say, “You’ll do this
you’ll do that."

34:40.960 --> 34:45.679
You say, “You show us what you do!” But
you do not.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.240
You go headlong.

34:47.240 --> 34:53.760
But the trouble is, oh God, the way you are
impressed by this circus! How can there be

34:53.760 --> 34:54.810
a circus of God?

34:54.810 --> 34:55.850
It has no pretensions.

34:55.850 --> 34:58.490
It cannot have any pretensions.

34:58.490 --> 35:06.850
Seeker: I’m not actually doing TM.

35:06.850 --> 35:10.710
I’m following the teachings of…

35:10.710 --> 35:14.120
Shri Mataji: What were you doing?

35:14.120 --> 35:19.670
Seeker: I’m not actually doing TM practices.

35:19.670 --> 35:21.250
Siddha Yoga.

35:21.250 --> 35:26.010
Shri Mataji: Who is that one?

35:26.010 --> 35:28.390
Seeker: Swami Muktananda

35:28.390 --> 35:33.630
Shri Mataji: Ah! Does he look like a siddha?

35:33.630 --> 35:34.630
How can you believe him, now tell me?

35:34.630 --> 35:35.630
First of all.

35:35.630 --> 35:39.060
Now I’ll tell you, I agree with you, but
you people are so simple.

35:39.060 --> 35:40.060
So simple.

35:40.060 --> 35:43.940
You go into his ashram, you meet his disciples:
poor things you know, they are good people,

35:43.940 --> 35:45.700
no doubt; lost, absolutely no doubt.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.090
But what have they achieved?

35:47.090 --> 35:50.340
All good people tossing their heads there.

35:50.340 --> 35:51.860
Have they known anything?

35:51.860 --> 35:54.130
Do they know anything about the Kundalini?

35:54.130 --> 35:55.450
Do they know how to raise the Kundalini?

35:55.450 --> 35:58.270
They know anything about the chakras?

35:58.270 --> 35:59.270
Nothing.

35:59.270 --> 36:00.270
Then how is it that you are also there?

36:00.270 --> 36:05.020
What I am saying is that these poor things
do not know anything.

36:05.020 --> 36:08.890
Now you ask here all these Sahaja Yogis are
sitting – they’ll tell you where is the

36:08.890 --> 36:09.890
catch.

36:09.890 --> 36:10.900
Even a child will say the same thing.

36:10.900 --> 36:18.520
Not necessarily [that] they should be very
intelligent here, or something very developed.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.810
Any child will say the same thing as others
will say because it’s there on the fingers;

36:21.810 --> 36:26.760
they are all going to feel the same way.

36:26.760 --> 36:35.290
But if you go and see these horrid people!
I mean they made the guruees and all these,

36:35.290 --> 36:42.090
what you call these, spoons around, we call
them chamcha in our language, means the assistants

36:42.090 --> 36:46.950
you know, who made a big ado out of these
big things.

36:46.950 --> 36:53.520
There’s no direct rapport with this Muktananda!
Horrible thing I say.

36:53.520 --> 36:57.480
How many people he has finished like this!

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
They want money.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.640
Let them do smuggling! Why are they after
all the saints?

37:02.640 --> 37:06.010
They want money that’s what they want, nothing
else.

37:06.010 --> 37:07.920
Their interest is money.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.800
But also they want to ruin the saints.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.470
They want to have it from the saints.

37:12.470 --> 37:16.730
Why don’t they do smuggling, they’ll do
better, than many smugglers.

37:16.730 --> 37:17.869
That’s their interest.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.370
You cannot purchase God.

37:20.370 --> 37:23.440
Have they transformed anyone?

37:23.440 --> 37:25.420
Why not see other people?

37:25.420 --> 37:27.020
Are they transformed?

37:27.020 --> 37:28.620
Are they relaxed?

37:28.620 --> 37:30.320
They all have blockages.

37:30.320 --> 37:34.970
And then they very nicely say, oh very good
explanations they have.

37:34.970 --> 37:49.690
One of them came to me from this Muktanand,
and he said that, “This guruji says, that,

37:49.690 --> 37:56.700
‘You have got this blockage because of your
purva karmas, the bad things you have done

37:56.700 --> 38:01.590
in last life.’ ” I said, “Really, and
what did he say that you were in last life?”

38:01.590 --> 38:14.030
“He said I was a pig!” I said, “What
bad things pig can do?” “He says might

38:14.030 --> 38:16.920
be a pig might have hit a human being."

38:16.920 --> 38:20.190
I said, “I have not seen any pig hitting
a human being.

38:20.190 --> 38:25.680
So what bad karmas a pig must have done?”
I said, “This fellow must have been a real

38:25.680 --> 38:28.840
pig in his head to tell you that."

38:28.840 --> 38:32.630
He doesn’t even have intelligence to tell
you that you were not a pig, but something

38:32.630 --> 38:42.460
that is aggressive at least he should have
told you! And then you must clear out your

38:42.460 --> 38:43.460
karmas you see.

38:43.460 --> 38:46.220
So I said, “What does he do about it?

38:46.220 --> 38:47.830
Sitting down there taking money for what?

38:47.830 --> 38:54.250
If he cannot clear out your karmas then he’d
better retire!” If you have to cleanse your

38:54.250 --> 38:57.000
karmas, then what is he doing there?

38:57.000 --> 39:03.120
I mean, imagine he has opened a shop, for
repairs, and if you have to repair your things

39:03.120 --> 39:05.230
then why is he there?

39:05.230 --> 39:06.360
What is he doing?

39:06.360 --> 39:11.660
“Oh he says he can wash off our one sixteenth
of the karmas."

39:11.660 --> 39:12.660
Really?

39:12.660 --> 39:15.110
But why only one sixteenth?

39:15.110 --> 39:17.960
He can wash off all your money alright.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.160
And why only one sixteenth.

39:19.160 --> 39:22.730
But why do you believe these stories?

39:22.730 --> 39:29.400
They made a big mistake, the Christians I
should say: they misinterpreted Christ.

39:29.400 --> 39:36.190
The message of Christ never reached India
in time to say that somebody was born on this

39:36.190 --> 39:40.110
Earth, to take away all our sins.

39:40.110 --> 39:50.060
If He’s awakened within us, all our sins
can be washed out because

39:50.060 --> 39:53.770
He is sakshat Parabrahma, He is sakshat Shri
Ganesh – purity Himself.

39:53.770 --> 39:59.510
If He’s awakened within us, all our sins
He can, suck in.

39:59.510 --> 40:06.460
These horrible Christians went there to convert
Indians, and now Indians have come to convert

40:06.460 --> 40:09.440
you! That’s what it is.

40:09.440 --> 40:16.160
Nonsense! It’s a very subtle action of negative
forces – all anti-God.

40:16.160 --> 40:22.480
It has nothing to do with God.

40:22.480 --> 40:26.980
Christ is a part and parcel of God as Shri
Ganesha is.

40:26.980 --> 40:29.140
There’s no difference between the two.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.940
He incarnated on this Earth for this particular
purpose.

40:31.940 --> 40:38.030
Every time you see this church service, “God
came on this Earth, to die for our sins."

40:38.030 --> 40:43.440
Alright then what are you doing about it?

40:43.440 --> 40:46.910
What does that mean?

40:46.910 --> 40:52.700
That means: if He’s awakened within you,
then He sucks all your karmas and your sins

40:52.700 --> 40:53.700
so-called.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.950
That’s why these people give you these explanations.

40:55.950 --> 41:02.400
And nobody can tell them off because they
start with one theory that side, that we have

41:02.400 --> 41:06.420
committed our sins, and that’s why we have
to pay for it.

41:06.420 --> 41:12.120
And here there are people, “We have done
original sin, and for that we must suffer."

41:12.120 --> 41:13.840
The Christians are suffering from where?

41:13.840 --> 41:15.700
I don’t know.

41:15.700 --> 41:20.350
And there the Indians are saying that we are
paying for our karmas, that’s why we are

41:20.350 --> 41:24.720
suffering and here these are suffering.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.630
This is all nonsense, I must say.

41:27.630 --> 41:32.770
How God must be feeling about the people,
who have been bestowed upon, by all His grace,

41:32.770 --> 41:40.700
by all His love, by all His beauty and are
‘enjoying’ the sufferings and announcing

41:40.700 --> 41:48.920
to the world, “We are suffering!” He wants
to suck all your sins.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.330
What sins can you commit also, human beings?

41:51.330 --> 41:52.930
What sins can you commit?

41:52.930 --> 41:55.820
You tell me.

41:55.820 --> 41:57.970
What sins have you committed?

41:57.970 --> 42:00.890
Specially you the saints who are seeking God
– what sins can you commit?

42:00.890 --> 42:05.630
Thank God in India the idea of sin is not
so strong.

42:05.630 --> 42:15.410
In a village, Indian village, a pastor went
there, and he told them something about Christ

42:15.410 --> 42:20.390
and something about, in their own way, he
preached them something.

42:20.390 --> 42:24.360
And they didn’t know what to say when he
was going, for a farewell, to be kind to him.

42:24.360 --> 42:29.420
So they said, “Thank you very much for coming
to our village and telling us what is sin.

42:29.420 --> 42:37.660
We did not know!” (laughter) What sins can
you commit?

42:37.660 --> 42:38.660
You tell me.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.660
What sin?

42:39.660 --> 42:43.330
I am talking about Ocean of Love, Ocean of
Forgiveness.

42:43.330 --> 42:50.840
Is He going to sit down and count your sins
or He is going to count the days when you

42:50.840 --> 42:55.300
have to have your Realisation, you have to
enter into His kingdom?

42:55.300 --> 42:58.960
He is your Father who loves you.

42:58.960 --> 43:04.980
Any father who loves does not sit down counting
the sins of his children.

43:04.980 --> 43:11.050
He is just counting days and days just for
His children to enter into His Kingdom to

43:11.050 --> 43:12.050
enjoy Him.

43:12.050 --> 43:13.050
What sins can you commit?

43:13.050 --> 43:15.440
And why are you suffering now?

43:15.440 --> 43:18.560
Christ did for you all the suffering.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.690
Now why are you suffering?

43:20.690 --> 43:27.400
That’s why the Jews don’t want to accept
Christ because they say, “We are suffering."

43:27.400 --> 43:31.410
And wherever they go everybody had to suffer
because of them! But they want to a create

43:31.410 --> 43:35.140
a story [that] they are suffering now, because
if they say, “We are not suffering,” means

43:35.140 --> 43:37.260
they accept Christ and that they don’t want
to say.

43:37.260 --> 43:42.470
Two thousand years they must suffer more,
make everyone suffer with wars and things.

43:42.470 --> 43:44.450
Because they cannot accept Christ.

43:44.450 --> 43:51.340
So this kind of madness all over! I mean everybody
is just the same.

43:51.340 --> 43:54.980
There’s nothing to choose.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.000
It doesn’t matter.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.690
Still Sahaja Yoga works out.

43:57.690 --> 44:02.930
Sahaja Yoga works out because, as I told you,
there’s one eternal truth: is that your

44:02.930 --> 44:06.320
Father, God Almighty, loves you.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.690
Remember that.

44:07.690 --> 44:12.830
Write it down everywhere so that you’ll
have confidence in yourself.

44:12.830 --> 44:14.390
Alright?

44:14.390 --> 44:19.850
I’ll put this Muktananda right don’t you
worry! How much money you have given him?

44:19.850 --> 44:20.900
Seeker: Not very much.

44:20.900 --> 44:24.831
Shri Mataji: Dekhiye! Abhi dekh lijiye! Mahati,
apne desh ke logon ki! Kitne rupiye khae in

44:24.831 --> 44:30.880
logon ka! (meaning: Look! Our country’s
money collectors – how much money they have

44:30.880 --> 44:32.740
eaten of these people!)

44:32.740 --> 44:36.000
Put your hands like this, just now.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.670
Just put your both the feet straight on the
ground.

44:39.670 --> 44:50.100
I see someone there! Hello, congratulations!
I have been dying to see the baby! Can I have

44:50.100 --> 45:00.460
her! Oooh ho! This dolly little thing! I’m
sorry I couldn’t come to see you in your

45:00.460 --> 45:16.470
house! Such a sweet thing as you are! Such
a sweet thing! May God bless you.

45:16.470 --> 45:36.180
She looks like me! (laughter) Beautiful! I’ve
been dying to see her! Beautiful! Born Realised.

45:36.180 --> 45:38.870
Great soul.

45:38.870 --> 45:46.560
Now the eyes have opened.

45:46.560 --> 45:59.010
Must put oil there, vibrated oil.

45:59.010 --> 46:03.940
May God bless you.

46:03.940 --> 46:05.310
Hmm.

46:05.310 --> 46:15.140
Now put your hands straight with both your
feet on the ground.

46:15.140 --> 46:17.160
Close your eyes please.

46:17.160 --> 46:19.670
Don’t fix your attention anywhere.

46:19.670 --> 46:22.690
Don’t say any mantra or anything.

46:22.690 --> 46:25.210
Just leave your attention free.

46:25.210 --> 46:32.530
The Kundalini has to rise and break the Sahasrara,
then you start feeling the cool breeze in

46:32.530 --> 46:34.510
the hand.

46:34.510 --> 46:38.910
Anybody having just a handkerchief for me?

46:38.910 --> 46:49.540
Just I forgot to bring I think.

46:49.540 --> 46:58.650
(5 minutes of silent meditation follow)

46:58.650 --> 47:03.210
Hmm! Better now?

47:03.210 --> 47:15.440
Why don’t you see these people who have
come for the first time, from the back?

47:15.440 --> 47:16.440
Douglas, you organise!

47:16.440 --> 47:17.890
Close your eyes! Close your eyes! They’ll
see from the back.

47:17.890 --> 47:25.220
Just close your eyes, just keep your eyes
shut! They won’t touch you, you won’t

47:25.220 --> 47:26.630
know what’s happening.

47:26.630 --> 47:28.990
They’ll just raise your Kundalini.

47:28.990 --> 47:29.990
Alright?

47:29.990 --> 47:32.600
They will try to raise your Kundalini so don’t
worry about them.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.780
Just they won’t touch you.

47:33.780 --> 47:39.480
They will know that you have got Realisation
or not, where there are problems.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.240
You got it?

47:41.240 --> 47:42.420
Have you?

47:42.420 --> 47:49.260
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands?

47:49.260 --> 47:51.480
No?

47:51.480 --> 47:54.470
What’s the matter?

47:54.470 --> 47:56.010
Are you?

47:56.010 --> 47:58.320
Anna, just see.

47:58.320 --> 48:02.950
All here is Ekadasha Rudra – complete.

48:02.950 --> 48:06.450
Put a bandhan on it.

48:06.450 --> 48:09.730
Ekadasha Rudra.

48:09.730 --> 48:11.380
Complete.

48:11.380 --> 48:16.310
No, this way.

48:16.310 --> 48:19.590
Whole thing.

48:19.590 --> 48:35.600
They have got it, she has got it.

48:35.600 --> 48:44.210
This one has got it.

48:44.210 --> 48:56.270
They get it fast, lose it fast.

48:56.270 --> 49:03.160
He’s got front Agnya.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.880
Aaah!

49:04.880 --> 49:17.630
Ask him to put right hand on the heart.

49:17.630 --> 49:19.300
He’s got Vishuddhi.

49:19.300 --> 49:21.520
Just give a bandhan.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.300
Left Swadishthana he has got.

49:24.300 --> 49:25.300
Hmm?

49:25.300 --> 49:26.300
Void.

49:26.300 --> 49:43.710
Void is there.

49:43.710 --> 50:16.380
You can also do this, to raise Kundalini,
once you have got Realisation you see.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.910
She’s got Void, she’s got Swadishthana,
Vishuddhi.

50:18.910 --> 50:19.910
Haa!

50:19.910 --> 50:20.910
Right Heart.

50:20.910 --> 50:25.490

50:27.840 --> 50:28.840
Haa! Now?

50:28.840 --> 50:29.840
Better.

Turn it around.

50:46.220 --> 50:47.220
Alright now?

50:47.220 --> 50:48.920
Hamsa he has.

50:48.920 --> 50:52.360
Left to the Right, just raise it.

50:52.360 --> 50:53.990
Other way round!

50:53.990 --> 51:05.430
He too has been I think to some guru.

51:05.430 --> 51:21.670
Ask him, he’s been to some guru.

51:21.670 --> 51:26.310

All of them.

51:33.270 --> 51:34.510
Ask a question.

51:34.510 --> 51:38.070
Is he alright?

51:38.070 --> 51:39.260
Void!

51:39.260 --> 51:42.830
How is he?

51:42.830 --> 51:44.030

51:44.030 --> 51:45.030
How is he?

51:45.030 --> 51:46.030
Right to the Left.

51:46.030 --> 51:50.800
Not to feel guilty.

51:50.800 --> 51:56.060
Please don’t feel guilty.

51:56.060 --> 52:01.550
Say that, “I am not guilty."

52:01.550 --> 52:02.550

Are you alright?

52:05.550 --> 52:06.550
Alright, everybody feels that way, doesn’t
matter.

52:06.550 --> 52:14.560
The one who is giving you also felt the same
way so it’s alright.

52:14.560 --> 52:17.160
Haa! Now it’s alright.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.160

52:19.160 --> 52:21.710

52:21.710 --> 52:24.310
Your face is changed.

52:24.310 --> 52:26.910
