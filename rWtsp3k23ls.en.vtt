07:26.678 --> 07:30.498
I am in a dilemma what language I should speak
to you all.

07:30.498 --> 07:42.378
First I’ll speak in English, then in Hindi,
then in Marathi.

07:46.378 --> 08:06.838
We all have come here to Kolhapur to worship
the Mahalakshmi.

08:06.838 --> 08:27.798
And you all know about the importance of Mahalakshmi.

08:27.798 --> 08:40.928
That Sushumna Nadi is the channel for Mahalakshmi.

08:40.928 --> 08:57.238
But this principle of Mahalakshmi is only
possible to manifest in us when our principle

08:57.238 --> 09:04.868
of Lakshmi is satisfied.

09:04.868 --> 09:12.228
When we see poverty in India we really get
very upset about it, and think: “When will

09:12.228 --> 09:22.258
it be all right, when all these people will
also get the blessings of the Divine?”

09:22.258 --> 09:27.298
[Hindi aside]

09:27.298 --> 09:34.428
So the principle of the Divine works through
Mahalakshmi.

09:34.428 --> 09:44.168
It’s a vicious circle that you have to get
to a point where your Lakshmi principle is

09:44.168 --> 09:54.768
satisfied and then only you start seeking,
and that seeking comes from the Mahalakshmi

09:54.768 --> 10:02.748
principle within us.

10:02.748 --> 10:12.798
So Sahaja Yoga grows in the middle path, in
the middle section of the society.

10:12.798 --> 10:21.328
Very rich will seldom come to Sahaja Yoga,
and if they come only, they’ll just take

10:21.328 --> 10:27.118
few advantages of it, and they won’t understand
the depth of it.

10:27.118 --> 10:30.288
In the same way the poor cannot come.

10:30.288 --> 10:40.438
So these are like the two shores of one river
that is flowing in between, and if we start

10:40.438 --> 10:49.188
expanding it, then we will definitely shower
the blessings of the Divine on all both the

10:49.188 --> 10:56.598
shores, and I’m sure lots of people who
look today to be poor, and who appear to be

10:56.598 --> 11:03.678
rich, will definitely become Sahaja Yogis.

11:03.678 --> 11:17.198
It’s such a vicious circle – that unless
and until you become a Sahaja Yogi, your financial

11:17.198 --> 11:21.768
situations cannot be improved very much.

11:21.768 --> 11:28.197
But you cannot become Sahaja Yogi unless and
until you have got your principle of Lakshmi

11:28.197 --> 11:29.388
satisfied.

11:29.388 --> 11:38.548
But how do we get our Lakshmi principle satisfied?

11:38.548 --> 11:48.757
– That we should see.

11:48.757 --> 12:08.438
That when we have little more money than required,
then we start thinking: “What shall I do

12:08.438 --> 12:10.988
with this money?”

12:10.988 --> 12:16.208
Then some people think: “All right, I’ll
have one more car, I’ll have one more house,

12:16.208 --> 12:19.678
I’ll have one more this, more that."

12:19.678 --> 12:21.708
But sagacity sets in.

12:21.708 --> 12:28.877
A kind of a satisfaction sets in: “Now,
what more?”

12:28.877 --> 12:37.107
In addition to that we have taxations, thanks
to the government, and all kinds of problems.

12:37.107 --> 12:42.178
So people think: “Now, I’ve had enough
of it, now no more, finished with it."

12:42.178 --> 12:45.267
So the hankering goes away.

12:45.267 --> 12:46.517
Hankering for money goes away.

12:46.517 --> 12:54.717
In Sahaja Yoga you are so blessed that you
start getting whatever you like, and at a

12:54.717 --> 13:01.648
point you reach and you think: “Oh wah,
too much, now no more – I’ve all."

13:01.648 --> 13:09.678
This is also another way, even before your
Lakshmi principle is satisfied, that if you

13:09.678 --> 13:16.157
get your Self Realization you can short-circuit
the whole thing.

13:16.157 --> 13:23.357
If that is short-circuited, then also you
can enter into Mahalakshmi principle.

13:23.357 --> 13:37.958
But in case where your situation is such that
now you have become overly rich, and if that

13:37.958 --> 13:46.157
richness has gone into your head and you think
no end of yourself, then there are still some

13:46.157 --> 13:49.688
chances of you getting into Sahaja Yoga.

13:49.688 --> 13:59.818
For example, if a very rich man is there,
if he gets sick, if he gets cancer, or his

13:59.818 --> 14:07.937
children start misbehaving, or he suddenly
gets a bad reputation somewhere, some sort

14:07.937 --> 14:17.017
of a shock from his right side can push him
to the center.

14:17.017 --> 14:26.648
Now the left-sided people are, who are suffering
too much because they are poor, because they

14:26.648 --> 14:35.247
are lethargic, because they don’t know how
to get to their jobs, they have no ambitions,

14:35.247 --> 14:37.877
nor do they compete.

14:37.877 --> 14:45.597
In a way they’re in a better situation than
the rich, because they don’t have to worry

14:45.597 --> 14:53.097
so much about income tax, as if they have
solved their problems by having no income,

14:53.097 --> 14:54.097
no car.

14:54.097 --> 14:58.107
If you have no car then you have, you don’t
have problems of car.

14:58.107 --> 15:06.567
If you have no – I’ve done that way; I’ve,
I never drive, so somebody has to drive Me.

15:06.567 --> 15:09.467
I can go by bus, I can go by rickshaw, anything.

15:09.467 --> 15:14.037
But if you drive, then you have to drive all
the rest of the people!

15:14.037 --> 15:24.787
If you have got, say, a house, you have a
problem.

15:24.787 --> 15:30.157
Everything that you possess, so-called, you
have a problem.

15:30.157 --> 15:38.017
And till you develop a complete detached feeling
about it, the problems are there.

15:38.017 --> 15:44.947
So then what happens to you, that when you
start, all these problems creeping up.

15:44.947 --> 15:50.417
In India specially I’ve seen, people become
generous, very miserly people also become

15:50.417 --> 15:56.218
generous because they become so fed up with
their so-called wealth that they start distributing

15:56.218 --> 15:58.808
it and giving it away.

15:58.808 --> 16:05.047
So the principle of Lakshmi is to give away,
to be generous.

16:05.047 --> 16:10.407
That principle starts working.

16:10.407 --> 16:18.978
Then the second principle of Lakshmi also
works with them when they have very nice beautiful

16:18.978 --> 16:26.008
houses and things, then they want people to
come to their house, stay there, see; look

16:26.008 --> 16:32.788
after, I mean, look after them and give them
food and, I mean, they enjoy all this giving

16:32.788 --> 16:39.098
parties, or maybe money, anything.

16:39.098 --> 16:42.238
So this generosity starts.

16:42.238 --> 16:43.878
But that generosity also is not very satisfying.

16:43.878 --> 16:50.738
They think that: “Still this generosity
is getting into my head, I’m still feeling

16:50.738 --> 16:59.928
as if I have done some great job, you see,
by being generous."

16:59.928 --> 17:09.327
Then this generosity, when it doesn’t satisfy
them, then they start thinking of getting

17:09.327 --> 17:11.517
to the truth of life.

17:11.517 --> 17:16.818
There’s a story about Shivaji, very interesting
story.

17:16.818 --> 17:23.648
He was once building a very huge big fort.

17:23.648 --> 17:28.438
And people were working and he was just looking
at them, and he thought: “See now, what

17:28.438 --> 17:29.957
a nice thing I am doing.

17:29.957 --> 17:32.388
I have given so much work to so many poor
people."

17:32.388 --> 17:36.618
And he was feeling quite happy about it.

17:36.618 --> 17:38.988
And he was looking at them.

17:38.988 --> 17:44.767
Suddenly his guru, Ramdas Swami came there,
and they were breaking one boulder.

17:44.767 --> 17:48.118
They said: “Slowly, slowly break it.

17:48.118 --> 17:49.577
Do not hit it hard."

17:49.577 --> 17:57.257
They were breaking slowly, ultimately they
came to a stone which was just like one coconut.

17:57.257 --> 18:04.767
So Ramdas Swami took that coconut in his hand
and broke it, and there was water in it and

18:04.767 --> 18:09.808
there was a frog sitting inside.

18:09.808 --> 18:17.517
Then Shivaji Maharaj realized that when God
creates you, He also provides you with things.

18:17.517 --> 18:21.248
You need not be proud that you are doing so
much for others.

18:21.248 --> 18:27.087
So in this generosity in the social work and
so-called doing for the poor, also, you develop

18:27.087 --> 18:31.878
a kind of a very funny ego and think no end
of yourself.

18:31.878 --> 18:37.568
And to pamper it also, people can give you
a peace prize, can give you a Nobel prize,

18:37.568 --> 18:39.558
this prize, that prize.

18:39.558 --> 18:46.318
Then of course there’s a very hard nut they
create out of your brains.

18:46.318 --> 18:51.887
That is how even this generosity can be very
dangerous, which creates this kind of a feeling

18:51.887 --> 18:58.538
that we are something great, and we are doing
this great work, and we are just looking after

18:58.538 --> 19:05.647
so many people.

19:05.647 --> 19:12.697
So then we come to another kind of people
who are really very miserly.

19:12.697 --> 19:14.657
They can never change.

19:14.657 --> 19:18.308
I think it’s a disease, with people who
are miserly.

19:18.308 --> 19:24.938
They are extremely miserly, and sometimes
I see the whole nation is of a miserly nature.

19:24.938 --> 19:39.217
They talk of money, and there’s no decency
about it.

19:39.217 --> 19:45.358
Many countries, who are supposed to be very
rich, we’re surprised that the people of

19:45.358 --> 19:54.447
that country are not only miserly but indecent,
and can’t understand how they could be like

19:54.447 --> 19:56.707
that: there’s no culture about it.

19:56.707 --> 20:03.138
Like somebody came with us and we went to
a hotel for a dinner.

20:03.138 --> 20:07.757
And after the dinner lots of things were left
over, so they got up and said: “Pack it

20:07.757 --> 20:08.757
for us."

20:08.757 --> 20:14.277
We Indians, I mean, we started looking here
and there: “What is this?”

20:14.277 --> 20:16.027
“Oh, we paid for it."

20:16.027 --> 20:20.767
Doesn’t matter, you can’t just say – do
that in this country.

20:20.767 --> 20:25.378
So there’s no shame, there’s no decency,
there’s no decorum about it.

20:25.378 --> 20:32.338
This is the greatest curse of being rich.

20:32.338 --> 20:46.197
People become absolutely shameless, indecent,
arrogant and above all, absolutely irreligious.

20:46.197 --> 20:52.757
So one has to fear now, those things which
are so illusory and look like something being

20:52.757 --> 21:06.498
very, very great to achieve, how they can
make a human being so horrible, so indecent.

21:06.498 --> 21:14.538
Because the rich have no manners at all of
any kind, they have no maryadas of any kind,

21:14.538 --> 21:20.717
and they don’t care for what others are
going to say, or what they have to be.

21:20.717 --> 21:34.458
So such rich countries have gone from left
to right, right to left, like a yo-yo, and

21:34.458 --> 21:35.458
are still doing the same.

21:35.458 --> 21:44.137
And also the kind of a ego that comes into
a rich man is really very stupid, extremely

21:44.137 --> 21:49.708
stupid, and people would laugh at them, the
way they behave.

21:49.708 --> 21:59.827
You must have heard about the king who made
chappals out of pearls, and there are people

21:59.827 --> 22:10.578
who are trying to show off their wealth in
the most hideous manner.

22:10.578 --> 22:17.647
To them, to show off their wealth is the only
criteria, but whether it is decent or whether

22:17.647 --> 22:23.697
it is decorous, or then, is it some sort of
a very cultured behavior, they’re not bothered.

22:23.697 --> 22:31.638
They are the people who are killers of culture,
and that’s how we find the people or the

22:31.638 --> 22:39.308
countries which are rich, absolutely kill
all the culture, all the behavior, heart of

22:39.308 --> 22:40.438
human beings.

22:40.438 --> 22:48.348
And the second thing they get into is complete
immorality, complete immorality: they have

22:48.348 --> 22:51.027
no morals of any kind.

22:51.027 --> 23:03.038
To them a girl of twenty years is the same
as a fiancé, whether they are 80 years of

23:03.038 --> 23:04.128
age.

23:04.128 --> 23:13.868
They have no sense of proportion; extremely
immoral, live a very immoral and an absolutely

23:13.868 --> 23:21.238
low-graded life which even an animal would
not do.

23:21.238 --> 23:29.498
So they get even not only human, sub-human,
but sub-animal also.

23:29.498 --> 23:36.748
So all the decency that comes from your culture,
or all the norms that are described about

23:36.748 --> 23:39.108
the culture, just disappear.

23:39.108 --> 23:46.377
Ha, they may have a decency as to what glass
should be used for which wine.

23:46.377 --> 23:53.108
Or could be what sort of a dress should be
worn for a particular thing, but even that

23:53.108 --> 23:55.438
is gone now.

23:55.438 --> 24:01.707
Anything is possible: “What’s wrong?”

24:01.707 --> 24:16.407
This arrogance of a very incorrigible ego
is even thickened when there are five, six

24:16.407 --> 24:20.898
more like them, because a competition starts.

24:20.898 --> 24:25.738
One says one thing so another says even a
higher thing than that, and the third one

24:25.738 --> 24:30.758
starts to compete and says something more
than that; and there’s a going on, and on,

24:30.758 --> 24:42.378
and on, and on between these people, all kinds
of horrible expressions of their ugly wealth.

24:42.378 --> 24:44.618
The whole society becomes so ugly.

24:44.618 --> 24:52.128
It so happened, unfortunately, that I had
to be with such people also.

24:52.128 --> 24:59.238
But thank God I have My own people, now you
are here, My own style, My own type.

24:59.238 --> 25:10.268
All of you are here, so close to Me, so much,
and what an atmosphere you have created.

25:10.268 --> 25:16.498
Even people in Kolhapur and here are all saying:
“We have never seen such beautiful people,

25:16.498 --> 25:18.478
so well behaved, so balanced.

25:18.478 --> 25:21.008
They never fight.

25:21.008 --> 25:26.028
They never say bad words, and they never hit
each other."

25:26.028 --> 25:30.758
Because whatever we had known of foreigners
was this, that they would come, enter into

25:30.758 --> 25:35.838
any house -during the time of British – and
get whatever they wanted.

25:35.838 --> 25:40.878
And later on – these were soldiers – and
later on came the hippies.

25:40.878 --> 25:48.178
Then came Hari Ramas, one after the another,
one better than the other.

25:48.178 --> 25:53.268
All these horrible experiences, and then you
people coming like great blessings.

25:53.268 --> 25:55.058
They are so impressed by you.

25:55.058 --> 26:12.478
They are more impressed by you than by Me,
I can tell you this much!

26:14.568 --> 26:20.008
I knew that this would happen when they will
see lots of Sahaja Yogis together, the way

26:20.008 --> 26:25.688
they live, the way they enjoy each other,
the way they have a nice time, and the way

26:25.688 --> 26:28.238
they are detached about things.

26:28.238 --> 26:33.128
Definitely they’ll be very much impressed,
and that’s what is happening today.
