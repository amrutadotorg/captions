00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.500
Today's Puja is a very great Puja for Me,

00:33:20.792 --> 00:33:26.083
because I suddenly find that My granddaughter is missing,

00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:30.125
and I got upset with it very much.

00:33:31.959 --> 00:33:36.250
Look at Me, supposed to be Adi Shakti,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.125
and why should I get so upset
about My granddaughter missing?

00:33:45.417 --> 00:33:48.500
It was just a human nature,

00:33:51.875 --> 00:33:55.667
which I realized all of us have.

00:33:58.083 --> 00:34:02.250
If we have some responsibility

00:34:04.583 --> 00:34:09.458
and we are not there, we get upset.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.625
Thank God there are very few children here,

00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:18.458
most of them have gone.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.959
But we are all children

00:34:26.208 --> 00:34:29.500
the way we worry, the way we are anxious.

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:36.125
Today I would like all of you to say

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:41.542
that a New Year has come.

00:34:43.834 --> 00:34:48.458
And in this New Year we all should have

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.333
a new proposal about ourselves.

00:34:53.083 --> 00:34:58.667
And that proposal is very difficult for people to make out

00:34:59.083 --> 00:35:03.375
- that we are not responsible for anyone.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.917
We are our own, and we live with ourselves.

00:35:12.208 --> 00:35:14.417
It's very difficult.

00:35:15.542 --> 00:35:17.083
Of course those who have no children

00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:19.000
are very happy people that way.

00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:23.083
But those who have,

00:35:23.417 --> 00:35:27.709
those who have certain responsibilities

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.208
and commitments they are still hanging in the air.

00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:41.041
They are nowhere near Sahaja Yoga, I must say.

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:47.542
Our main responsibility is ourselves,

00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:53.291
is to know ourselves

00:35:53.583 --> 00:35:56.166
and to depend on ourselves.

00:35:57.792 --> 00:36:00.667
It is a very big responsibility,

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:06.250
because now as we will be having big functions

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.917
and we might feel that we are lost in it.

00:36:14.375 --> 00:36:17.458
Please, try to remember

00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:20.500
that  you have to remember your Self.

00:36:21.375 --> 00:36:24.667
You have to know that you are there.

00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:28.208
That's the message I wanted to give you.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.417
I hope you'll think it over.

00:36:30.917 --> 00:36:36.041
May God bless you all!
