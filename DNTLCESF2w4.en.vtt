00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:17.883
This part is also the Void, the green part which is the principle of mastery or guru tatwa you can call it.

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:24.485
If you’ve been to a wrong guru or if you have bent yourself before wrong people, you’ll catch.

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:29.922
But if you think you are a great guru yourself, you will catch here.

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:35.311
In both ways you'll catch and these are expressed here and also you can feel them on your head.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:41.411
If you are bending before people who are wrong, fake and all that

00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:45.696
then you’ll catch on these five centers here.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:50.480
And if you are thinking you are a great guru yourself, you will catch here.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.822
In the center here is the power of the primordial being

00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:59.679
and the eleven of them you call as Ekadesha Rudra.

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.186
These are the eleven powers of destruction which will come at the end,

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:10.143
when the whole judgement is over and after the judgement is over.

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:16.349
Then that power is going to come on the white horse, as they said, just to sort out the last of it.
