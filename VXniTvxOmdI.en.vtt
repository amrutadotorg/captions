03:30:26.929 --> 03:30:32.793
I think all of them are great speakers, I get lost from words.

03:30:36.489 --> 03:30:44.319
As it is, I, you know that Indian music has something to do with the Spirit

03:30:44.499 --> 03:30:51.179
and also it has to do with your awareness. Say for example, when you start an Indian music

03:30:51.499 --> 03:30:59.419
...in any Raghas, first they pick up your foundations, how you... how you see,

03:31:00.049 --> 03:31:07.609
how it is going to be within yourself, say your Muladhara is built up, to begin with, so that you are settled down

03:31:07.859 --> 03:31:14.539
and then the infrastructure is built and then the whole thing, the permutations and combinations are being built up.

03:31:14.539 --> 03:31:21.779
But it is a kind of a movement of your awareness, which you'll be noticed.

03:31:22.379 --> 03:31:30.859
That in the classical music, first you have a very slow movement to bring your attention

03:31:31.219 --> 03:31:39.739
...in a particular direction to settle you down and then gradually you find the awareness

03:31:39.979 --> 03:31:47.099
starts becoming alert, then it becomes dynamic, then it starts bubbling.

03:31:47.779 --> 03:31:54.299
The other way round are the things like drinking, wines, the other way round.

03:31:55.019 --> 03:32:02.379
See, it is first you are bubbling, you are happy. Then you start drinking the wines and all that,

03:32:02.619 --> 03:32:11.379
then you start more bubbling this thing and trying to, you feel that you are absolutely abundant

03:32:11.619 --> 03:32:18.259
and you are in a bad place mood. But gradually it settles down into a very morose ending

03:32:18.499 --> 03:32:24.059
till I don't know how you come out of your pubs. So, this is,

03:32:25.219 --> 03:32:31.179
this is the reason why all the saints have said that drinking is against awareness

03:32:31.339 --> 03:32:37.539
but music is not because see, at this time, as he is saying, it's 4 o'clock, I didn't see the time all this while

03:32:37.779 --> 03:32:45.619
but it's which is 4 o'clock at this time, you are so alert and fresh because it has nourished your awareness.

03:32:46.299 --> 03:32:51.099
It has definitely nourished all of us. Now, regarding the artist,

03:32:51.899 --> 03:32:59.419
I don't know, he says he is inspired or whatever it is but there is a kind

03:32:59.899 --> 03:33:05.899
of a work which I think is played by the Kundalini of a person

03:33:06.459 --> 03:33:12.139
but it doesn't work in everyone, it works in very sensitive people, I've seen

03:33:12.619 --> 03:33:19.339
and they react in such a manner that I myself am amazed sometimes how dynamic they become

03:33:20.059 --> 03:33:28.459
and how joyous, gradually the joy starts bubbling in them. I mean, they are entertaining you

03:33:29.019 --> 03:33:36.059
they are giving you joy but they see their own creative powers working, they see the whole thing completing

03:33:36.299 --> 03:33:42.539
and that is the thing that gives them joy. See now, this is, is the creation, that's before Me

03:33:42.939 --> 03:33:49.219
and see how he was joyous and how you were enjoying his creation and he was also enjoying his creation

03:33:49.659 --> 03:33:56.459
and the same gentleman who was playing tabla was, I was singing, he was rhythmically moving with him

03:33:56.539 --> 03:34:01.339
the same way as he was, the rhythm was there and sometimes he was playing with his rhythm

03:34:01.659 --> 03:34:07.419
but what you call is the playfulness and the Leela,

03:34:08.699 --> 03:34:17.099
Leela was there between the two. So the life has not to be a burdensome thing, it has not to be like a hangover

03:34:17.419 --> 03:34:25.099
but has to be something very light, bubbling, beautiful and joyous. So here an artist also

03:34:25.339 --> 03:34:32.059
because he's talking about Gula Marikhasava, I've seen him. He was in the beginning very serious, started

03:34:32.299 --> 03:34:39.739
and he went up to a point. Then he would just start as if he's Shri Krishna playing Holi, he would go on playing

03:34:39.979 --> 03:34:45.179
[Marathi]

03:34:45.409 --> 03:34:51.409
then he would start jumping half way. I saw him, every time he used to take a tan, he used to go half way up and down like that.

03:34:51.579 --> 03:35:01.379
So dynamic, I mean at that age when I saw him, I was myself amazed because this gentleman, he's not only singing but he's doing all kinds of exercises

03:35:01.619 --> 03:35:08.939
and so beautifully he was singing, so beautifully. So this is what it is that, it is a

03:35:10.059 --> 03:35:14.579
different side that music is absolutely

03:35:15.579 --> 03:35:21.739
nourishes our awareness, just like flowers, just like all the beautiful things of the world

03:35:22.059 --> 03:35:29.579
nourish our awareness. Music, maximum it has the effect and that's why you see that even at

03:35:29.819 --> 03:35:36.819
4 o'clock we are so fresh and tomorrow we are going to look absolutely fresh. I know we have done this many a times.

03:35:37.819 --> 03:35:44.819
So, this is what is to the music and to the artist, I must say, the way he was lost into it.

03:35:45.059 --> 03:35:51.059
He was very meditative in between, I saw him, he got meditative. You see, when they have to

03:35:51.819 --> 03:35:57.819
get into their creativity, they go into meditative mode and from there they pick on to it, right.

03:35:58.059 --> 03:36:06.059
While playing one raga only, he thought of dropping one uh.. note and playing another raga, he went into that raga.

03:36:06.059 --> 03:36:13.059
See, just sort of you, you completely lose your self-consciousness and you can get merged into the

03:36:13.299 --> 03:36:21.299
portion of notes and ragas but there are maryadas. In Indian music there are maryadas.

03:36:21.539 --> 03:36:28.539
You cannot just start singing darwali and end up with the jazz or something, you cannot. You have to keep darwali with darwali,

03:36:28.779 --> 03:36:35.779
you can from darwali you can drop something, you can go into another raga, it's different but you cannot just start

03:36:36.059 --> 03:36:43.059
uh.. going from one raga into some sort of an English music or some sort of a

03:36:43.299 --> 03:36:50.299
another African music, it cannot be. You have to keep two ragas and there is a maryadas and this is the thing

03:36:50.539 --> 03:36:58.539
we have to understand that we are enjoying ourselves, in our awareness, we are all in a very joyous mood

03:36:58.539 --> 03:37:05.539
because we have maryadas. If you don't have maryadas, you can never enjoy. It get lost, it get lost and it reacts.

03:37:05.779 --> 03:37:14.779
So the whole thing today was a beautiful uh.. court as you said and in the court there has to be a protocol,

03:37:15.019 --> 03:37:22.019
there has to be maryadas and everybody has a place and then it's a beautiful thing to live together.

03:37:22.179 --> 03:37:30.779
So in the whole of our society, Sahaja yoga society and with maryadas, then we'll change the whole world, no doubt about it.

03:37:31.019 --> 03:37:38.699
And then the music will be of a very high quality, very nourishing, which will nourish our Spirit

03:37:38.939 --> 03:37:45.939
and which we'll be able to enjoy ourselves and for our progeny we'll be a beautiful world.

03:37:46.379 --> 03:37:53.379
So I bless you all that you try to invite the dedication and devotion of these artists

03:37:53.619 --> 03:38:01.379
and see at this young age, how far they have gone for music. So in the same way, the music of your Spirit,

03:38:01.619 --> 03:38:09.619
you also have to dedicate and also this music also, if you can learn, it will be a good idea, if some of you try.

03:38:09.779 --> 03:38:18.299
But in any case, I don't know this music, I cannot sing but at least I can appreciate and in the same way you are appreciating.

03:38:18.539 --> 03:38:26.059
In My childhood, both of us used to sing very well but I took to medicine because I had to talk to [unclear] later on,

03:38:26.299 --> 03:38:32.299
as we did today and that's why My sister took to music, that's the difference.

03:38:32.459 --> 03:38:38.459
Otherwise we were both good singers but I couldn't take to music and so now I'm very happy

03:38:38.699 --> 03:38:44.579
that we are so much appreciating it and understanding.

03:38:44.819 --> 03:38:52.819
I would like Indian music to spread to the whole world, that maybe because you might think I'm Indian, it's not the point but I think

03:38:53.059 --> 03:39:00.659
Indian music, if you know, you can know any music and as you have seen in the case of Simon, he told Me that he has become very creative

03:39:00.699 --> 03:39:08.499
since he did some Indian music lessons. So, because there's freedom, you see, he's free, there's freedom but in maryadas.

03:39:08.739 --> 03:39:15.339
It's like a aeroplane which is properly tied up and is properly in his maryadas, can fly anywhere.

03:39:15.579 --> 03:39:21.499
In the same way, he has got his maryadas and then he went absolutely into the apsars.

03:39:21.739 --> 03:39:27.739
So these two principles are to be understood and to be enjoyed in music and I'm sure that

03:39:27.859 --> 03:39:34.859
we will also be able to produce some very good musicians out of you, if not from you, at least from your children.

03:39:35.099 --> 03:39:40.099
May God bless you! Thank you!
