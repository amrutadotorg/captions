WEBVTT

01:39.229 --> 01:45.499
You must have felt the vibrations of this
place; they are tremendous. And that we should

01:45.499 --> 01:52.499
come here after so many years is really very
much surprising. This place has a great connection

01:53.170 --> 02:00.170
with Me as such because My forefathers ruled
in this place, and this was the capital of

02:11.930 --> 02:18.930
Shalivanas called as Pratishthan, and then
they made it easier as Paithan. They were

02:20.680 --> 02:27.079
the rulers here for thousands of years. And
they are the ones who started this Shalivahan

02:27.079 --> 02:34.079
Dynasty, actually they called themselves as
Sath Vahan, means seven vahanas. They represented

02:37.129 --> 02:44.129
the seven vahanas of the seven chakras. It's
surprising how it is so Sahaj. After that

02:48.370 --> 02:55.370
there was a great poet, as you know about
him, Gyaneshwara, who came here. He was born

02:55.510 --> 03:02.510
very close to this place, who was here for
quite some time. And there was one fellow

03:06.299 --> 03:13.299
who was a very supraconscious person who challenged
him. His name was Changdev. So he said that

03:15.769 --> 03:22.769
“What do you have with you to show that
you have got God with you?” And there was

03:26.879 --> 03:33.879
a male buffalo with him, male buffalo, which
was just walking on the road, and Gyaneshwara

03:40.500 --> 03:47.500
made that buffalo say Veda Mantras. And this
Changdev try to show some tricks. Gyaneshwara,

03:53.650 --> 04:00.650
with his brothers and sister, was sitting
on a broken wall and he made the wall move

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
with all of them in the air. And then he realized,
Chandev, that this is some sort of an incarnation

04:12.629 --> 04:15.650
on this earth.

04:15.650 --> 04:22.650
Apart from that, there's another great poet
called Eknath who has written lots of folk

04:24.340 --> 04:31.340
songs, like Namadeva, describing Sahaja Yoga.
So this place had some sort of attractive

04:39.370 --> 04:46.370
focus of vibrations for all these great saints
to come and settle down. They've excavated

04:50.800 --> 04:57.800
lots of old things about this place and the
sari that is given to the Goddess here is

05:00.250 --> 05:07.250
made in this place, called as Paithani. It
started in the time of Shalivana and that

05:07.330 --> 05:13.419
art is still there. That's the only sari in
which they use real gold as the thread, real

05:13.419 --> 05:20.240
gold. Just for the Goddess.

05:20.240 --> 05:27.240
So this place is still very vibrating, is
out of the way for the people to come down,

05:29.180 --> 05:36.180
thank God, so it still maintains its own vibration,
its goodness and its purity. And you are all

05:38.979 --> 05:45.210
very lucky people in this group to have come
to this place and to have visited this. As

05:45.210 --> 05:52.210
you will go round you will see there is a
beautiful garden next to it. The river Godawari

05:54.139 --> 06:01.139
is called as the Ganga, the Ganges of the
South. It starts from Nasik where you were

06:01.349 --> 06:08.349
before, and then brought here and a big dam
is made for the supply of water all over which

06:10.190 --> 06:15.680
you can see on your way. There is a beautiful
garden nearby and Eknath's temple is just

06:15.680 --> 06:22.680
behind here. So we can all go and have a look
at it also.

06:26.760 --> 06:33.760
I am happy you went and saw Ajanta caves.
Should show you how people were dedicated,

06:36.880 --> 06:42.669
to build all that in ten centuries. They had
not seen Buddha at all; Buddha never came

06:42.669 --> 06:49.669
to the south of India. Just believing in Buddha
what work they did, what sacrifices, how they

06:53.830 --> 07:00.830
built it. They had to go through very difficult
times because there was no water, there was

07:03.019 --> 07:08.860
no communication, nothing. And they used the
stones, you must have seen there, of different

07:08.860 --> 07:14.719
colors and different hues which are created
by Mother Earth. And when you break them,

07:14.719 --> 07:21.719
inside those egg-like stones you get beautiful,
semi-precious stones. They dissolved them

07:25.940 --> 07:32.370
into some sort of an indigenous solvent and
used it for painting. And that's how the paintings

07:32.370 --> 07:38.070
are today surviving. You can't see without
lights, so how they must have painted it at

07:38.070 --> 07:44.580
that time? What sort of eyes they must be
having? Their dedication gave them this power

07:44.580 --> 07:51.580
that they could build it. They carried on
for ten centuries this work.

07:51.719 --> 07:58.690
If Sahaja Yoga can be carried for ten centuries,
this world would be a different place. So

07:58.690 --> 08:05.690
one has to learn that we have to dedicate.
We must fully dedicate ourselves. We are not

08:08.810 --> 08:15.159
here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga.
Like in the beginning, people have problems

08:15.159 --> 08:19.990
about their families, so they think that God
should solve the problem because they have

08:19.990 --> 08:23.539
come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga
now, so God must solve their problems. Now

08:23.539 --> 08:29.440
they have problems of their jobs, God must
solve the problem. If they have problems with

08:29.440 --> 08:35.169
their relations, so God must solve their problems.
That's the sort of a job given to God because

08:35.169 --> 08:40.479
they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga.
Then, after that, God must give them money.

08:40.479 --> 08:47.110
He must provide them for everything. And He
must look after them. For no commitment at

08:47.110 --> 08:50.000
all, there is no commitment. Nobody has any
commitment in Sahaja Yoga. But God is committed,

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
and God has to work it out. Then they start,
some people, foolishly start using Sahaja

08:58.050 --> 09:05.050
Yoga for other purposes, like earning money
or earning power, or name, or fame, or domination

09:06.100 --> 09:07.860
or anything.

09:07.860 --> 09:14.860
These are the steps which are going down,
not upwards. And then, once you go down you

09:18.950 --> 09:25.950
don't realize whether you are going upward
or downward. So in dedication one has to see:

09:26.320 --> 09:32.220
what have I dedicated for Sahaja Yoga? All
the time I have problems. All the time I say

09:32.220 --> 09:36.029
I can't do this because of that, I can't do
that because of this, there’s the problem,

09:36.029 --> 09:41.610
this I would like to do, this I would like
to do. All the time there’s an I, I, I and

09:41.610 --> 09:48.610
I, but what have I dedicated? What time have
I given to Sahaja Yoga? How much money have

09:49.490 --> 09:56.490
I given to Sahaja Yoga? Nothing at all. People
don't even take leave for Sahaja Yoga. They

09:58.810 --> 10:03.480
can't do anything for Sahaja Yoga. These people
not only took leave, but permanently went

10:03.480 --> 10:09.019
and settled in that place, in that far-fetched
place. Without any machinery, without anything

10:09.019 --> 10:16.019
they did that whole painting and the whole
excavation and all that, what you call the

10:18.110 --> 10:25.110
entire work of such a tremendous volume that
is impossible in these modern times. Nobody

10:28.050 --> 10:32.249
can recreate something like that - with all
your machinery, with everything - because

10:32.249 --> 10:33.660
people don't have dedication.

10:33.660 --> 10:40.660
So for Sahaja Yoga we have to put ourselves
onto a point: What did I do? What did I sacrifice

10:40.730 --> 10:47.550
for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing. It's only for my
own child or maybe for my wife, or for myself,

10:47.550 --> 10:54.550
or for my job or for something. What is our
commitment? And without commitment, purity

10:56.709 --> 11:03.709
cannot come in. You will go up and down like
a yo-yo. We are committed to Sahaja Yoga.

11:08.069 --> 11:15.069
If there are even five people who are really
fully committed to Sahaja Yoga it can be built

11:17.970 --> 11:24.970
up that way. But the problem is everybody
shares with each other this kind of non-committal

11:29.389 --> 11:36.389
behavior. And that’s something not good.
Committed means even if we have to give our

11:37.879 --> 11:44.879
life we should do it. Even if we have to give
up everything, we should do it. But all other

11:47.990 --> 11:53.809
considerations are to be taken there, everything
should work out. So all should be joy all

11:53.809 --> 11:58.790
the time, you must get your jobs, you must
get your wives, you must get your everything,

11:58.790 --> 12:05.790
children properly done, everything to be done
by Sahaja Yoga. And when this commitment will

12:08.990 --> 12:15.990
start I am sure Sahaja Yoga will spread like
anything. Even falsehood, when people are

12:16.199 --> 12:23.110
committed, like you see in all other religions,
every religion they did that. And how much

12:23.110 --> 12:30.110
it has spread. Of course, Sahaja Yoga is blessings,
is blissful. It blesses you all the time.

12:30.649 --> 12:36.170
It gives you a very long rope to hang you
also sometimes. One must know that it’s

12:36.170 --> 12:39.170
a blessing of that kind also.

12:39.170 --> 12:46.110
So one has to be very, very alert that God
has chosen us for such a special work and

12:46.110 --> 12:53.110
we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.
All those who are wise will take to this and

12:57.730 --> 13:02.709
understand that the life is only worth this,
otherwise it's useless. It's good for nothing.

13:02.709 --> 13:09.709
It has no meaning. And this has to come from,
first from the leaders and then from others.

13:18.170 --> 13:25.170
Complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga. It doesn't
mean that you have to give up anything. For

13:28.480 --> 13:33.999
My sake you don't have to do anything. But
for your own sake, for your own betterment

13:33.999 --> 13:40.999
you have to do it. I hope next time when you
come to India you will be coming better prepared

13:44.869 --> 13:51.869
for commitments. It's not only money, it's
not only your talking about, your saying about

13:52.269 --> 13:59.269
it, writing about it, but it is through your
own being it should happen. You all should

13:59.319 --> 14:06.319
become the source of energy that I want to
emit all over the world. That light which

14:07.779 --> 14:14.779
is going to enlighten. No amount of artificiality
is going to work it out, but complete genuineness

14:14.930 --> 14:15.670
within you.

14:15.670 --> 14:19.600
Look at these saints, they had nobody, they
didn't have Mother to help them. This Gyaneshwara's

14:19.600 --> 14:26.600
life if you read you will be shocked. He didn't
have even shoes to walk. He was treated so

14:29.329 --> 14:34.529
badly because his father was a sanyasi and
was married so they said that these are the

14:34.529 --> 14:40.129
children of a sanyasi. They had no food to
eat. They had to walk for miles together bare

14:40.129 --> 14:46.360
feet, they had no blessings of the Mother
on them. Despite that they kept to Sahaja

14:46.360 --> 14:53.360
Yog, kept to their blessings of being one
with God. Because they achieved that state.

14:58.459 --> 15:05.459
Now all this is for your good, for your benevolence
that you get all the blessings. But that doesn't

15:09.689 --> 15:16.689
mean that you should stagnate, that you should
not progress. One has to progress higher and

15:17.110 --> 15:23.920
higher. One has to decide the commitment.
I am committed to Sahaja Yoga. And that is

15:23.920 --> 15:30.660
what you have to be, committed.

15:30.660 --> 15:37.660
May God bless you all.

15:39.379 --> 15:44.129
Today we’ll – being the first puja we
wont have a long puja, we’ll have Ganesha’s

15:44.129 --> 15:51.129
Atharva Sheersha then maybe hundred and eight
names could be said. It’s not going to be

15:58.550 --> 16:05.550
very long puja, and I think then you have
to also go to Veru to see … (Marathi or

16:27.529 --> 16:34.529
Hindi)… I think you can go tomorrow to Veru.
See, it takes hardly about two hours or three

16:37.420 --> 16:44.420
hours. Two hours at the most. And then you
can go to Shrirampur.

16:57.139 --> 17:01.369
You have to be ready tomorrow quite early
in the morning. Go and see Veru, which is

17:01.369 --> 17:06.270
about two hours’ journey from here, and
then you can go to Shrirampur where you can

17:06.270 --> 17:13.270
have your lunch, rest there, in the evening
there’s program for you. I hope you enjoyed

17:14.120 --> 17:21.120
your visit to Ajanta. I was waiting for you
here, then I had to leave because you were

17:24.329 --> 17:28.260
very much delayed; and I am sorry for what
has happened in Malavathi, that there was

17:28.260 --> 17:35.260
some inconveniences because I was not there.
Just imagine, if I am not in a place how things

17:35.520 --> 17:36.400
go wrong! I mean, I just start wondering what
will happen when I will not be there.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.830
So the commitment has to be there. That’s
the main point is.

17:37.830 --> 17:39.650
…. I was thinking that you need not come
today to Aurangabad, because it’s quite

17:39.650 --> 17:44.440
far away and then you have to go tomorrow
to Veru; so this is the place where they have

17:44.440 --> 17:51.440
arranged everything for you, so it’s better
that you stay here, there’s a beautiful

18:02.900 --> 18:09.900
garden. You can have a look at the garden,
then have your food here and rest, and tomorrow

18:12.400 --> 18:17.370
morning early in the morning if you can leave
then you can see Veru also and I’ll look

18:17.370 --> 18:17.620
after the Aurangabad program, all right?
