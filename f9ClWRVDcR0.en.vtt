00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:37.367
It would be better if you are

00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:58.048
All right

00:05:22.747 --> 00:05:29.997
We are here we all understand English do you all the people who are reporters English?

00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:35.817
We are here

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:38.997
To inform you about

00:05:40.987 --> 00:05:42.987
a power

00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:46.168
Which is within us?

00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:48.987
and the power that

00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:57.987
Can give you what is promised by all the same scriptures and all the incarnations

00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:06.087
Today when you see the young people in every country specially in the West

00:06:10.387 --> 00:06:13.527
You'll find they are not satisfied

00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:18.027
With their own atmosphere

00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:21.778
Their lives

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.597
And they think there is something missing

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:35.367
And they are extremely confused

00:06:41.778 --> 00:06:43.807
Now when they are confused

00:06:45.407 --> 00:06:47.947
They are seeking for something beyond

00:06:49.788 --> 00:06:51.788
Something unknown to them

00:06:55.098 --> 00:07:00.967
In that seeking they may take to anything extreme

00:07:06.107 --> 00:07:12.847
Drugs could be alcoholism

00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:25.658
Or some other perversions, which cause horrible diseases incurable diseases

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:43.928
Instead of condemning them

00:07:45.618 --> 00:07:48.067
We have to see why they are doing all these things

00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:52.148
What is the purpose

00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:03.417
Also some of them went to some gurus

00:08:08.227 --> 00:08:10.227
Which are in the market

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:24.737
Especially when they see the religious people and the religions

00:08:26.097 --> 00:08:32.777
They cannot believe that religion can give such horrid experiences

00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:47.298
And some of them are anti-god anti-religion also

00:08:58.358 --> 00:09:05.307
But if you deal with the problem sympathetically you cannot blame them because they are intelligent

00:09:06.907 --> 00:09:08.907
Aware people

00:09:20.568 --> 00:09:28.388
So now we have to category of people one the ones who are not seeking at all

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:39.567
And another are the once

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:45.958
Who want to find out solutions of the problems

00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:58.967
In every generation

00:10:00.457 --> 00:10:03.117
We had people who revolutionized

00:10:04.627 --> 00:10:11.787
Because they did not like a particular system or did not like a particular style of life, whatever it was

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:18.207
But now the revolution has to come from within

00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:23.727
We have to evolve from within

00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:40.738
Because the destruction is also coming from within

00:10:42.877 --> 00:10:45.717
We are destroying ourselves more from within

00:10:47.738 --> 00:10:51.208
Because we are so unhappy so confused

00:10:54.037 --> 00:10:58.287
Absolutely quite a percentage is schizophrenic

00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:06.898
So then we start seeking this solution

00:11:08.498 --> 00:11:12.447
And in that seeking we make mistakes

00:11:22.337 --> 00:11:28.037
And we make mistakes because we do not know what to seek

00:11:35.437 --> 00:11:37.437
And how to find

00:11:42.657 --> 00:11:44.897
Also how to evolve to that state

00:11:55.518 --> 00:11:57.637
So logically we have to reach

00:11:59.028 --> 00:12:01.028
some conclusions logically

00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:04.927
That it has to be some

00:12:05.928 --> 00:12:07.308
evolutionary

00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:09.018
happening

00:12:09.018 --> 00:12:11.018
This is logical to

00:12:11.238 --> 00:12:13.037
transform ourselves

00:12:13.037 --> 00:12:15.577
There has to be some evolution

00:12:22.948 --> 00:12:24.948
You was not an Austrian magic

00:12:32.798 --> 00:12:34.798
Freud was invited

00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:39.478
All right, so like you have said that

00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:42.808
You have to become

00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:48.447
Collectively conscious you have to become it's an actualization. It is not just a certificate

00:12:49.658 --> 00:12:52.617
It has to be come from within it's an honest thing

00:12:53.318 --> 00:12:55.177
It's an innate thing

00:12:55.177 --> 00:12:57.177
It is not just a preaching

00:12:57.367 --> 00:13:01.917
Or sort of a giving a certificate it is not or taking a name

00:13:03.788 --> 00:13:07.347
It is actualization within yourself so

00:13:10.297 --> 00:13:14.367
That something has to happen to us

00:13:18.188 --> 00:13:24.718
Now as we have evolved from monkey stage to this stage for example

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:29.518
You've done nothing it is a living process

00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:39.297
Which has taken place spontaneously

00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:56.078
There's a big resistance

00:13:59.418 --> 00:14:01.418
To any

00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:04.938
Oriental ideas

00:14:04.938 --> 00:14:06.938
being accepted in the West

00:14:07.518 --> 00:14:09.518
wick resistance I

00:14:09.918 --> 00:14:13.777
Find there's a very big resistance for any oriental ideas

00:14:19.908 --> 00:14:21.908
Coming to the West

00:14:30.657 --> 00:14:34.276
Now these oriental ideas which are coming

00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.277
Are to be seen with a scientific open mind

00:14:50.968 --> 00:14:57.207
Because the Western life has grown like a tree outside

00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:01.827
But the roots may be in the East

00:15:07.598 --> 00:15:12.598
Maybe we can keep ourselves open to see we're at the roots

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:29.868
Now if the roots are in the East supposing it's an hypothesis

00:15:30.778 --> 00:15:35.778
So let us have a look at it. If there is any solution in those

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:40.757
So you go to oriental, I guess

00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:45.287
But there also, it's very dangerous

00:15:46.768 --> 00:15:53.507
Because you are going in the unknown you might go to false guru. You might go to wrong people

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.688
And get completely destroyed

00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:02.728
So

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:04.678
What do we do?

00:16:04.678 --> 00:16:09.347
First thing we should know we cannot pay for our evolution

00:16:10.258 --> 00:16:12.617
We cannot pay money is not there

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:31.197
Nor can we pay for any living process any living process we cannot be

00:16:35.198 --> 00:16:41.067
Like if the seat has to sprout the mother earth is sprouted we don't pay the mother earth

00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:50.038
All right so first thing they should have known that anybody who asks for money

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:56.787
Is not a truthful person no money should be known

00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:06.867
Then the second point comes in that we got to this stage of human awareness

00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:10.708
Spontaneously

00:17:12.938 --> 00:17:14.938
Without any effort effortlessly

00:17:20.868 --> 00:17:22.868
In the same way it should happen

00:17:31.838 --> 00:17:35.998
But first of all in every evolution there has been one leader

00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:52.718
We can call them as archetypes as they say or whatever you may say want to say

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.617
So you was not very clear on that point

00:18:01.157 --> 00:18:04.147
So now such a person can decode

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.417
the information

00:18:08.117 --> 00:18:09.498
Of

00:18:09.498 --> 00:18:12.068
symbols and everything and

00:18:13.128 --> 00:18:18.218
Can help others without taking any money without taking any gratification?

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:24.367
Can do it and here it is

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:29.287
That people fumble in the West

00:18:30.648 --> 00:18:32.648
They don't mind a pope

00:18:33.107 --> 00:18:35.437
They don't mind an RPF of canterbury

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:41.527
But they do mind a person who is doing everything free just out of love

00:18:49.237 --> 00:18:56.877
You'd be amazed in England the television people told me that we cannot accept anything which does not take money

00:18:59.648 --> 00:19:01.737
Can you believe it he's a fact

00:19:04.088 --> 00:19:11.607
In I think in Boston or somewhere they asked me a question how many Rolls Royces you have got

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.778
This is

00:19:17.468 --> 00:19:23.067
And in San Francisco, they would not even publish my advertisement

00:19:23.768 --> 00:19:27.387
Because by mistakes we had said that it can cure AIDS

00:19:28.148 --> 00:19:34.677
They said no we don't want AIDS to be cured. We don't want anything to deal with our homosexuality

00:19:36.427 --> 00:19:38.967
They said that horrible things that

00:19:40.058 --> 00:19:42.058
65 percent people are

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.098
homosexuals in San Francisco and

00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:46.977
the editor if he's a homosexual

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.628
and the

00:19:49.628 --> 00:19:52.018
Chairman is even the Mary's

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:55.018
so I didn't know what to do I

00:19:55.598 --> 00:19:59.098
Thought it better not to advertise because we will be useless for them

00:20:01.208 --> 00:20:03.208
This is the problem is

00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:09.778
Then the most important thing which is not realized by modern mind

00:20:12.158 --> 00:20:16.017
That they believe anything new is to be tried

00:20:17.558 --> 00:20:19.558
Is a very dangerous thing

00:20:35.097 --> 00:20:41.837
If we are dealing with the living process of evolution we have to know

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:46.107
That

00:20:46.107 --> 00:20:47.398
in

00:20:47.398 --> 00:20:49.078
spiritual life

00:20:49.078 --> 00:20:51.078
Whatever is going to happen

00:20:51.357 --> 00:20:56.297
Must relate to scriptures to all the Scriptures must relate

00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:20.887
Not to one scripture say for Holy Bible or Holy Quran or any but to all of them

00:21:25.638 --> 00:21:27.638
Because it is like a seed that

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.378
sprouts

00:21:30.378 --> 00:21:32.378
Then it becomes

00:21:32.628 --> 00:21:34.578
the stem

00:21:34.578 --> 00:21:36.578
then the branches

00:21:36.978 --> 00:21:38.978
then the leaves

00:21:39.168 --> 00:21:45.818
Then the flower and then the fruit living process it is based on something

00:21:47.538 --> 00:21:54.788
Evolves through something, but whatever is dead like we can create a fruit plastic fruit from nowhere. Just like that is you

00:21:56.058 --> 00:21:58.058
So which has no basis?

00:22:04.688 --> 00:22:12.208
Has no meaning it must have a basis from where it has come its origin must be seen

00:22:29.188 --> 00:22:31.188
As in the growth of the

00:22:31.438 --> 00:22:32.488
tree

00:22:32.488 --> 00:22:38.807
all that is useless drops out in the same way in evolution also all that is useless drops are

00:22:39.208 --> 00:22:43.157
Even useless tradition drop out everything drops out but ultimately

00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:45.767
You reach to the epitome

00:22:46.078 --> 00:22:48.078
Where you become the fruit?

00:22:52.968 --> 00:22:59.858
So the time has come for human beings to become the spirit

00:23:15.338 --> 00:23:17.338
What's the white cotton

00:23:23.257 --> 00:23:25.257
Fabric

00:23:25.418 --> 00:23:30.537
So every seed has memory alright and

00:23:32.137 --> 00:23:36.327
In the same way within us is our Camry is the Kundalini

00:23:51.968 --> 00:23:56.108
And this is to be actually awakened actually awakened

00:24:08.008 --> 00:24:13.337
Of course the superficial people who are not worried about the world will not bother about

00:24:13.948 --> 00:24:18.198
Their out of question superficial people, but there are another kind

00:24:19.138 --> 00:24:21.467
Who is making money in the name of?

00:24:22.648 --> 00:24:24.648
spirit

00:24:24.658 --> 00:24:28.967
Or living on that money and organizing

00:24:37.778 --> 00:24:39.778
We'll definitely oppose us

00:24:41.377 --> 00:24:45.177
Naturally we become controversial for them because the basically we'll use them

00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:51.297
For no fault of ours we don't mean too much it just happens along

00:24:53.528 --> 00:24:55.528
But a person who has

00:24:57.188 --> 00:24:59.188
Pure intelligence

00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:06.598
You need not be a very well-educated person nothing but pure intelligence can see through the game

00:25:08.737 --> 00:25:10.797
Should be able to see through the game

00:25:25.058 --> 00:25:27.388
Now in sahaja yoga, we have

00:25:28.058 --> 00:25:30.058
thousands of people all over the world

00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:34.768
There are people who are we can call them the highest in the society?

00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:39.327
There are people who are the lowest in the so-called society?

00:25:40.508 --> 00:25:42.508
all of them are

00:25:43.388 --> 00:25:50.997
At par with each and every person there is no higher lower feeling

00:25:53.348 --> 00:25:59.067
Everyone belongs to that society and so it belongs to that society

00:26:04.748 --> 00:26:06.458
Moreover

00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:08.458
when this happens

00:26:08.828 --> 00:26:11.008
Because we understand

00:26:12.038 --> 00:26:14.337
What these incarnations where?

00:26:16.388 --> 00:26:18.388
The conflict of

00:26:18.518 --> 00:26:20.518
All religions drops out like that

00:26:20.948 --> 00:26:24.898
We understand it on central nervous system the conflict drops out

00:26:25.568 --> 00:26:29.638
There is no question of not worshiping Christ

00:26:30.638 --> 00:26:32.757
Muslims Jews Hindus

00:26:33.398 --> 00:26:35.398
all worship Christ

00:26:35.528 --> 00:26:40.887
They all worship Muhammad SAW, and they all worship Rama, Krishna

00:26:42.638 --> 00:26:43.958
Because

00:26:43.958 --> 00:26:45.958
Actually, they see that

00:26:46.808 --> 00:26:50.878
when the Kundalini Rises she passes through certain centers and

00:26:51.638 --> 00:26:55.557
There you have to take the name of those great

00:26:56.288 --> 00:26:57.848
incarnations

00:26:57.848 --> 00:27:00.238
so this is the knowledge of the roots and

00:27:01.418 --> 00:27:04.287
one must know that you have to become a subtler being

00:27:05.048 --> 00:27:07.048
to understand that knowledge

00:27:07.778 --> 00:27:10.347
But unless and until we have that knowledge

00:27:13.418 --> 00:27:19.557
We are in for a catastrophic there's a big shock awaiting us

00:27:21.698 --> 00:27:24.248
And how are we going to avert it?

00:27:28.908 --> 00:27:32.168
Just by talking about peace you don't bring peace

00:27:35.328 --> 00:27:37.958
Those who talk about peace they don't have peace within themselves

00:27:57.348 --> 00:28:01.057
So we are at that point we try

00:28:02.478 --> 00:28:06.337
To talk about tell about it persuade people

00:28:07.668 --> 00:28:12.037
And media can help us it has helped us a lot in Italy

00:28:14.298 --> 00:28:19.688
And also in India of course because in India people know they have the knowledge of the route

00:28:20.568 --> 00:28:22.958
So it's very easy in the villages of India

00:28:23.628 --> 00:28:26.198
Even in the cities of India's we are

00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:30.458
Doing very well not only that but

00:28:31.368 --> 00:28:36.337
say for example Delhi University has accepted sahaja yoga for research and

00:28:37.308 --> 00:28:43.718
The degree you get is a Doctor of Medicine higher than post graduation after post graduation

00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:47.107
You get this degree is very rare Doctor of Medicine

00:28:48.528 --> 00:28:54.517
For sahaja yoga, they have accepted even Cambridge University has accepted this for a result

00:28:55.308 --> 00:28:58.088
So once you try to see the sense in it

00:29:02.688 --> 00:29:05.917
Not they have not done it to criticize him, but with respect

00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:12.397
Not to criticize it but with respect with acceptance that there is something about

00:29:16.227 --> 00:29:21.316
So I would request the media to give the facts

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:27.017
By understanding it you have nothing to gain

00:29:29.278 --> 00:29:30.567
But

00:29:30.567 --> 00:29:33.557
Austrian people should be benefited. That's all

00:29:34.497 --> 00:29:39.437
As a result of Kundalini awakening it can claim many things

00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.946
But that can be seen that

00:29:45.178 --> 00:29:49.127
Cancer can be cured so many incurable physical diseases can be cured

00:29:50.487 --> 00:29:52.487
mental diseases can be cured

00:29:53.457 --> 00:29:55.457
Drug addiction can be cured

00:29:57.117 --> 00:29:59.117
The problems created

00:30:01.377 --> 00:30:03.377
By these gurus can be cured

00:30:07.048 --> 00:30:11.027
All these things can be done when you become the spirit

00:30:11.668 --> 00:30:14.477
But this should be just at a level

00:30:15.507 --> 00:30:17.507
of a hypothesis

00:30:17.967 --> 00:30:21.946
When we do it, and it's proof, then you should accept not blindly

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.587
There is no blind faith in sahaja, yoga

00:30:28.077 --> 00:30:31.637
We have no priest roots nobody is paid

00:30:34.408 --> 00:30:36.408
It's a free society

00:30:46.938 --> 00:30:49.748
And everyone becomes very knowledgeable

00:31:00.718 --> 00:31:04.468
A sahaja yogi, may not be a doctor, but he can cure people

00:31:05.978 --> 00:31:09.297
He may not be a sec artist, but he can keep your mad people

00:31:11.318 --> 00:31:13.318
He becomes equipped

00:31:13.448 --> 00:31:16.167
With the power by which he does it

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:18.958
like Christ was not a

00:31:19.628 --> 00:31:21.008
doctor

00:31:21.008 --> 00:31:23.008
Sure people in

00:31:23.828 --> 00:31:26.638
The same way in the same fashion

00:31:29.648 --> 00:31:35.907
Now I would like you to ask me questions because it's a very wide subject and one can go on talking about it

00:31:35.908 --> 00:31:42.688
I wanted these people to explain to you for 15 minutes all other things so that you will have your questions ready for me

00:32:10.647 --> 00:32:15.016
Any other you've said in the literature any unauthorized tampering

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:19.306
Can harm in some way your yoga?

00:32:20.337 --> 00:32:22.337
How do you explain this unauthorized?

00:32:22.918 --> 00:32:26.627
Anthony tampering interference written by sahaja Yogi's you see the language is

00:32:31.137 --> 00:32:35.446
Probably people who try to awaken the Kundalini of course of course you

00:32:36.658 --> 00:32:39.918
See the Kundalini can only be awakened

00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:42.798
by a person who has the authority

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.357
divine authority

00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:52.306
You cannot elect a person you see like we can elect a priest. It's not like that. You must have the power

00:32:53.278 --> 00:32:55.168
to raise the Kundalini

00:32:55.168 --> 00:32:57.287
Now those people who are leading already

00:32:58.497 --> 00:33:02.836
But you can say every in one word dirty life. You can see

00:33:05.427 --> 00:33:07.427
Cannot raise the Kundalini

00:33:08.158 --> 00:33:12.677
you have to belong to this pure religion inner pure religion and

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:16.158
You have to have these powers

00:33:27.568 --> 00:33:33.767
Otherwise those people who try other tricks what they do they disturb your sympathetic nervous system

00:33:34.647 --> 00:33:36.178
activated

00:33:36.178 --> 00:33:38.098
Kundalini doesn't rise

00:33:38.098 --> 00:33:40.098
Kundalini will only rise

00:33:40.228 --> 00:33:42.088
by a

00:33:42.088 --> 00:33:44.088
proper sahaja yogi

00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:49.608
For example I'll tell you

00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:54.948
Supposing there is a seed

00:33:56.938 --> 00:34:00.047
And you want to plant it

00:34:06.188 --> 00:34:09.208
So you have to put it in the mother art

00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:12.208
Supposing you put it on this table it won't

00:34:13.298 --> 00:34:15.867
But supposing you put it in the fire it will burn

00:34:18.998 --> 00:34:21.477
Only the mother earth has the power to sprout

00:34:22.208 --> 00:34:30.208
That's what it is all right. I mean when you give communique Muslim is clear-cut all stuff. It's but I wouldn't understand myself

00:34:31.118 --> 00:34:33.118
I'm sorry for that

00:34:37.478 --> 00:34:40.197
What else these a lot of homework, I must say

00:34:41.618 --> 00:34:43.618
It's great

00:34:43.778 --> 00:34:45.098
and

00:34:45.098 --> 00:34:47.098
That's why you must have read

00:34:47.408 --> 00:34:51.717
There were some books in German also about Kundalini horrible books

00:34:52.508 --> 00:34:56.997
That it harms you will burn chewed nothing of the kind it does not

00:34:58.598 --> 00:35:03.478
It is the sympathetic when activated by wrong type of things like sex

00:35:04.778 --> 00:35:07.257
activations another the activation some people

00:35:07.628 --> 00:35:13.617
Try to turn this out and all that and you start seeing the light and all that thing. This is not short-circuiting

00:35:15.038 --> 00:35:17.038
Actually you suffer a lot with that

00:35:18.128 --> 00:35:21.807
It's a spontaneous it just happens to be spontaneously

00:35:35.908 --> 00:35:39.748
Are you feeling relaxed yourself you got it

00:35:41.468 --> 00:35:43.468
You've got your realization

00:35:45.158 --> 00:35:47.458
Only thing you have to little bit know about it. That's all

00:35:48.788 --> 00:35:50.788
absolutely relax this or thought

00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:56.978
You got it

00:35:56.978 --> 00:35:58.478
You got it

00:35:58.478 --> 00:36:04.677
just while talking to me you got it because you are a positive person want to know about if you come with a

00:36:05.858 --> 00:36:09.027
Determined effort just to criticize then nothing can work out is it

00:36:09.757 --> 00:36:11.757
It's nothing's got it

00:36:12.158 --> 00:36:14.158
You got it

00:36:14.978 --> 00:36:16.978
May God bless you

00:36:18.998 --> 00:36:22.287
It's your own I've done nothing I was just talking to you

00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:28.047
Kundalini knows that you are sitting before me she just rolls by herself. That's your mother

00:36:29.408 --> 00:36:32.668
That's your mother your own indeed your mother

00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:37.498
That's the Holy Ghost that's the primordial mother

00:36:38.978 --> 00:36:43.797
Which Christians don't talk about and then they don't want you to know anything else?

00:36:44.198 --> 00:36:47.157
whatever they will teach you should learn nothing more I

00:36:48.128 --> 00:36:50.547
Was myself born in a Christian family?

00:36:51.878 --> 00:36:58.107
So you have to have you see blinkers on both the sides you're not supposed to see this fight work that side

00:36:58.838 --> 00:37:02.517
And this is why young people fell a trap

00:37:03.158 --> 00:37:06.478
To these horrible gurus who came to make money here I?

00:37:07.598 --> 00:37:09.687
know of somebody who came from jail

00:37:10.748 --> 00:37:12.748
Who came to Germany?

00:37:12.998 --> 00:37:16.378
wearing those saffron clothes sat on one of the

00:37:17.678 --> 00:37:22.678
Centers there somewhere and a relief rock to him he came from jail

00:37:28.178 --> 00:37:30.038
Because you don't know

00:37:30.038 --> 00:37:32.128
how to make out a good

00:37:33.158 --> 00:37:38.758
Guru the sub guru and the a guru is there are books and books on that come India

00:37:39.338 --> 00:37:41.368
but they don't know four things and

00:37:42.158 --> 00:37:48.538
I don't blame them because they were seeking seeking so honestly that they got into trouble

00:37:49.238 --> 00:37:51.297
But I have been talking about them from

00:37:52.028 --> 00:37:54.028
1974

00:37:55.958 --> 00:37:57.958
But the underworld

00:37:58.388 --> 00:38:04.018
Another problem was with young people from the West was that they hated Christianity

00:38:04.118 --> 00:38:08.818
That's one problem so when I talked about Christ they just under went back

00:38:09.728 --> 00:38:11.728
You can talk to them

00:38:13.628 --> 00:38:15.718
They said don't talk of Christ they went out

00:38:17.738 --> 00:38:23.818
So this Christianity has done nothing but a harm to them that they just don't want to hear about Christ

00:38:24.308 --> 00:38:27.357
Which Christ is a living God no doubt?

00:38:29.108 --> 00:38:31.258
And I have to talk about him very much

00:38:32.588 --> 00:38:36.838
But they didn't like it. It's such a problem of

00:38:39.038 --> 00:38:40.688
Conceptions

00:38:40.688 --> 00:38:45.328
Conceptions see reality is what reality is is not a concept

00:38:46.118 --> 00:38:51.328
This is what it is see Christ is the son of God. He is the real

00:38:52.148 --> 00:38:54.098
personality whatever

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:58.828
Church may do to eat or anyway do to it makes no difference he is what he is

00:38:59.348 --> 00:39:01.438
And this is the problem is the concept?

00:39:02.528 --> 00:39:04.528
Concept is not reality

00:39:04.628 --> 00:39:06.628
that's just a mental prediction just

00:39:08.318 --> 00:39:10.318
a mental projection

00:39:11.698 --> 00:39:13.698
You have to rise beyond that

00:39:14.128 --> 00:39:16.128
to be the spirit

00:39:16.258 --> 00:39:17.728
All right

00:39:17.728 --> 00:39:19.937
We got this nano your name, please

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:23.358
your name, please

00:39:25.288 --> 00:39:27.288
George

00:39:29.578 --> 00:39:31.578
Is the name of an angel

00:39:33.508 --> 00:39:35.508
Yes st. George and st

00:39:36.868 --> 00:39:44.327
George we call him as Bhairava in our Indian language. He's called as head of a st. George

00:39:46.318 --> 00:39:48.318
Very great God

00:39:48.628 --> 00:39:50.628
accordion

00:39:57.788 --> 00:40:01.977
So we have nobody else now here Steve you have any questions

00:40:03.788 --> 00:40:07.558
Now must be because you see you're a two-faced journalist, what about you?

00:40:28.078 --> 00:40:32.747
Where has this message can spread in the world - which country

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.468
It's now 16 countries

00:40:44.548 --> 00:40:47.717
There are thousands of people in about six of those countries

00:40:55.498 --> 00:40:57.768
Of course of course we

00:40:58.618 --> 00:41:01.517
Have here actual RCZ was in the Islam religion

00:41:02.248 --> 00:41:04.248
from, Algeria

00:41:04.258 --> 00:41:09.348
Then of course you know him very well, and here only you'll find people from different

00:41:10.078 --> 00:41:12.078
religions sitting here

00:41:13.648 --> 00:41:18.017
There's a lady from a Hindu religion there sitting and

00:41:19.348 --> 00:41:22.638
What was your religion? Maybe she?

00:41:25.078 --> 00:41:27.078
Born again

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:35.118
You self-certified God again, I thought no, that's same thing guys

00:41:35.968 --> 00:41:37.588
All right

00:41:37.588 --> 00:41:43.848
So of course no doubt we have an all religions all caste or creed like Sierra

00:41:44.398 --> 00:41:46.607
Leone now we have got the Africans there

00:41:47.427 --> 00:41:49.427
There we have got

00:41:49.947 --> 00:41:56.597
Spain we have gotten even into Bolivia. Will you be eyes what is that religion therefore?

00:41:59.638 --> 00:42:04.127
Only we have a kind Bolivia and also in

00:42:06.058 --> 00:42:08.058
Now in Peru everywhere

00:42:08.998 --> 00:42:10.468
so

00:42:10.468 --> 00:42:17.238
It is infinite it goes to everyone it cannot be see even God is one how can you have?

00:42:18.358 --> 00:42:20.308
anybody barred

00:42:20.308 --> 00:42:22.308
we have Chinese and

00:42:22.408 --> 00:42:28.577
We have Japanese all types of people we have from all races from everywhere, so there's no question

00:42:29.348 --> 00:42:31.348
what is

00:42:31.838 --> 00:42:36.477
But actually I cannot give the list of all the nations, but practically all except for Scandinavian

00:42:37.957 --> 00:42:44.097
Nations we have not approved, but we have Scandinavian people in sahaja yoga, but we have not yet established centers

00:43:07.868 --> 00:43:09.868
So many people were there

00:43:14.738 --> 00:43:21.358
See I think Italians are great sensitive people

00:43:22.687 --> 00:43:24.687
Italians are very sensitive and

00:43:25.418 --> 00:43:33.087
You will be surprised in Italy there are no gurus except in the north of Italy. They are very sensitive very emotional and sensitive and

00:43:34.028 --> 00:43:37.558
they respect love and they have respect for mother all and

00:43:38.197 --> 00:43:43.737
When they saw my photograph they did feel something about it. I don't know what they felt about my photograph

00:43:43.738 --> 00:43:47.398
I don't know what photograph. It was but they felt peace maybe

00:43:48.008 --> 00:43:50.008
Whatever it is

00:43:50.858 --> 00:43:55.378
But I was amazed the whole hall was filled with me absolutely and

00:43:56.558 --> 00:44:00.418
Italians even as far as the government is concerned

00:44:01.868 --> 00:44:04.257
All of them are very open to sahaja, yoga

00:44:05.677 --> 00:44:11.787
Surprising they're very sensitive people, and they must have found out about me that I have done all good

00:44:13.207 --> 00:44:20.907
There's no objection to anything and now they have invited me to a press conference which we do. I will tell you what it is

00:44:21.427 --> 00:44:29.427
It is a press conference of all the people of Italy it's a very big thing called as the press conference

00:44:30.308 --> 00:44:32.308
guest of the Year mother most of the

00:44:47.958 --> 00:44:49.958
Talking to all of them

00:44:51.378 --> 00:44:56.107
Will be nice be nice really nice meeting them all yes

00:44:56.958 --> 00:45:01.958
But I feel Austria is one country which is very much in the center somehow

00:45:03.288 --> 00:45:06.757
It's very much in the center Austrians are neither East nor West

00:45:07.518 --> 00:45:12.278
Centipede and they are very good for sahaja yoga, very sensible people in Austria

00:45:13.818 --> 00:45:21.277
And we have found very sensible people in Austria no doubt about it another thing is Austria has never given us any

00:45:21.558 --> 00:45:23.298
problem

00:45:23.298 --> 00:45:25.298
We never got people who were

00:45:26.208 --> 00:45:30.998
schizophrenic or nonsensical or fighting types nothing very nice people did want

00:45:31.638 --> 00:45:33.638
surprising

00:45:33.678 --> 00:45:37.188
So Austria has a special place. I think in Europe

00:45:58.638 --> 00:46:05.257
It's very you know they are very heavy, and you're put very small means there so what happens

00:46:12.288 --> 00:46:14.288
If they don't get it

00:46:15.138 --> 00:46:17.138
What if they get it

00:46:18.648 --> 00:46:24.097
Some people get the Kundalini raise some don't what happens to people after death if they don't

00:46:39.768 --> 00:46:45.038
Religions work on a concept that you do it our way, or you end up in a horrible place

00:46:47.808 --> 00:46:49.808
No, it's not like that

00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:52.208
You see I think

00:46:52.338 --> 00:46:54.338
most of the people should get it

00:46:55.248 --> 00:46:57.248
to get a very generous

00:46:57.528 --> 00:47:00.128
We work the whole thing as the world is today

00:47:00.888 --> 00:47:05.917
It will be taken by people they have take to realization. I'm sure

00:47:06.618 --> 00:47:12.847
Most of them will get it supposing if they don't get and die then there will be born again, and they'll get it

00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:20.408
But those work to go to hell will go to hell in any way

00:47:21.288 --> 00:47:22.698
in any way

00:47:22.698 --> 00:47:25.748
You see there there. There are people as used

00:47:25.748 --> 00:47:32.648
I would say who would never take to anything good would be there could be people I have not known

00:47:32.648 --> 00:47:35.467
But maybe we should give all the benefit of doubt

00:47:43.298 --> 00:47:45.328
Yes because you see

00:47:46.448 --> 00:47:52.047
Yes, that is it now. I'll tell you what happens that your spirit is absolutely. It's absolute

00:47:52.988 --> 00:47:55.017
Spirit is an absolute thing

00:47:55.598 --> 00:47:56.128
supposing now

00:47:56.128 --> 00:47:58.888
You want to know whether I'm good or not?

00:47:58.888 --> 00:48:00.278
Or he's good or not

00:48:00.278 --> 00:48:05.608
The good is not the way we look at things like you see we see the dress in the face

00:48:05.608 --> 00:48:10.708
This is not looking superficially, but when we have to see person is good or not we see

00:48:11.528 --> 00:48:13.528
We feel his chakras

00:48:13.988 --> 00:48:20.637
What chakras he's catching you can feel them on your fingertips you see like Muhammad Sawa said that your hands will be speaking

00:48:20.918 --> 00:48:24.178
So you feed on your centers than other person?

00:48:24.818 --> 00:48:30.688
So we don't certify them as good or bad that category doesn't exist in sahaja yoga, what we say

00:48:30.688 --> 00:48:32.907
What are the centers catching in a person?

00:48:33.878 --> 00:48:40.888
Now what is catching in a person? What centers are wrong? We try to correct it?

00:48:42.128 --> 00:48:47.037
We like it. We can say a patient comes to a hospital the doctors

00:48:47.038 --> 00:48:51.328
Don't say you have good or bad. They don't categorize like that what they seem

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:56.458
What is the disease let us treat that it's like so the good and bad?

00:48:57.338 --> 00:49:03.958
Is not described in sahaja yoga, what is described at the centers which are out of place?

00:49:04.778 --> 00:49:11.158
But some people have ruined their centers completely have no Kundalini at all with them

00:49:11.158 --> 00:49:16.198
They are like devil some of them must have been I don't want to name them, but could have been

00:49:16.808 --> 00:49:24.537
So this is such people then what to do. They must have designer. I mean you cannot force anyone. That's the big problem

00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:31.287
If they desire it well and put if they don't desire it you cannot just make them do it no you cannot

00:49:31.748 --> 00:49:34.227
They have to desire it in their own freedom

00:49:35.948 --> 00:49:37.948
Then they get it the joy

00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:45.197
Nothing can be forced. This is the handicapped

00:49:53.387 --> 00:50:00.667
So we have don't know category we don't condemn anyone as bad, or we do not elevate somebody as excellent, but

00:50:01.308 --> 00:50:05.828
We tell them what are the center sketching and when you get your realization

00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:09.397
You will know what sketching in you and you will also know. What is catching in him

00:50:09.397 --> 00:50:12.277
And then if I tell you supposing I if I tell him

00:50:13.008 --> 00:50:19.808
Dr. Warren your other sketching means your ego is coming up. He won't feel bad because he'll get a headache there

00:50:19.808 --> 00:50:21.808
They said better correct it mother

00:50:22.788 --> 00:50:26.197
Which is ego will get a headache a little bit Surratt corrected?

00:50:26.867 --> 00:50:28.867
so nobody feels bad about

00:50:29.657 --> 00:50:35.467
It so there is nothing like good and bad are words used very vague. They are very weak terminologies

00:50:35.627 --> 00:50:40.087
This is not procedure about it because fear it is absolute so

00:50:40.788 --> 00:50:43.477
Everything related to spirit is the absolute knowledge?

00:50:45.197 --> 00:50:47.197
You may say a person is very good

00:50:47.718 --> 00:50:52.147
This is an excellent person that we don't accept what we accept is

00:50:52.147 --> 00:50:55.927
What are the condition of his chakras are and how much we can help?

00:51:00.468 --> 00:51:05.887
That's not we not bothered about who's good who's bad that category doesn't exist that

00:51:06.528 --> 00:51:10.568
Type of a category, but of course the condition of the chakras are varying

00:51:23.408 --> 00:51:27.208
Any other question Steve. You better ask me. He's an American I

00:51:33.068 --> 00:51:35.068
Describe it

00:51:38.798 --> 00:51:41.397
I never had it so how much

00:51:43.568 --> 00:51:45.568
I'm born like this but

00:51:47.258 --> 00:51:52.798
I would say the experience of self-realization that I have seen that happens to people first of all

00:51:53.618 --> 00:51:59.128
When the kundalini rises you see of course the mechanism goes into complete force?

00:52:00.098 --> 00:52:02.098
and

00:52:02.558 --> 00:52:05.577
When she pierces through the fontanel bone area

00:52:06.518 --> 00:52:08.518
first thing you feel is the

00:52:09.068 --> 00:52:10.478
cool breeze in the hands

00:52:10.478 --> 00:52:17.548
But not necessarily some people feel it on top of their heads coming out a cool breeze from their head own head

00:52:17.948 --> 00:52:25.498
So the self-certification is there you see the cool breeze, but could be some people have too much heat coming out see supposing

00:52:25.498 --> 00:52:27.498
It's a cancer patient especially

00:52:27.968 --> 00:52:33.778
Or anybody like that to see this patient you find that a heat comes out

00:52:35.198 --> 00:52:38.127
Supposing it's a person. Who is very much possessed and

00:52:39.158 --> 00:52:41.218
extremely unhappy type of person maybe

00:52:41.888 --> 00:52:47.638
Or an open person whatever it is the Kundalini you can see clearly with your own eyes

00:52:47.888 --> 00:52:52.678
It's pulsating at different centers, but especially at the base of

00:52:53.408 --> 00:52:56.248
the spine will be called as the

00:52:57.728 --> 00:52:59.408
sacrum

00:52:59.408 --> 00:53:00.698
sacrum

00:53:00.698 --> 00:53:06.748
Sacrum is sacred both and the sacred book so you can see it very clearly we have got photographs of that absolute

00:53:06.968 --> 00:53:08.968
Pulsation you can see like a heart

00:53:10.118 --> 00:53:13.258
Then they experience moves with some people it does

00:53:13.258 --> 00:53:19.377
I must say they do feel the rising if it is slow rise, but if it shoots off

00:53:19.378 --> 00:53:22.528
You don't feel anything you just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

00:53:23.318 --> 00:53:26.668
Then you start feeling out of your fingertips

00:53:27.868 --> 00:53:30.587
But the feeling you get first of all

00:53:31.498 --> 00:53:34.848
When heat rises about this Center you feel?

00:53:36.178 --> 00:53:40.157
You're beyond, thought. You are in the present. We are not

00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:44.778
Just enjoying the peace peace of your being

00:53:45.508 --> 00:53:47.538
enjoying yourself in the way and

00:53:49.318 --> 00:53:52.007
Then when it pierces through a kind of a

00:53:53.998 --> 00:53:57.737
Joy that trickles it out in different different people have different

00:53:58.378 --> 00:54:03.407
But say for Indians you see they don't think so much as you think you people think think think think too much

00:54:03.778 --> 00:54:07.128
So they don't think so they get there first of all they get the joy

00:54:08.668 --> 00:54:10.728
But in the West I think the people who get

00:54:11.398 --> 00:54:16.608
More the awareness about it. They start feeling his chakras is chakras

00:54:16.608 --> 00:54:21.767
They practice these that ultimately they get the gist, but Indians first get the joy they said

00:54:25.318 --> 00:54:30.947
It depends on the condition of a person what the experience would be but on the whole

00:54:31.228 --> 00:54:38.358
This one thing happens to all of you that your eyes start listening. They said listen. There's a twinkle in the eye

00:54:40.078 --> 00:54:42.078
That's one

00:54:43.498 --> 00:54:46.217
And their face becomes to see relaxed

00:54:46.858 --> 00:54:50.207
The wrinkles drop out you drop out sometimes ten years

00:54:50.878 --> 00:54:54.618
like see my aged 64 years of age -

00:54:55.888 --> 00:55:02.868
But people can't believe it because you see I don't feel my age at all. I'm we all have forgotten what our ages are and

00:55:04.138 --> 00:55:08.958
This is what happens to you because you go in a state of existence only

00:55:09.688 --> 00:55:11.688
But takes little time

00:55:12.358 --> 00:55:18.437
Gradually to grow into it, but it starts with the sprouting of this seed that is the Kundalini

00:55:20.098 --> 00:55:24.497
But experiences people have different like in your case. It was very deep I know

00:55:26.638 --> 00:55:32.988
Because he was a great seeker, and he has started a band without knowing the word surge on his own Siraj bad

00:55:32.988 --> 00:55:36.887
I don't know how he started. He must have got it from the unconscious really

00:55:40.748 --> 00:55:42.748
And he had such a strong

00:55:44.438 --> 00:55:51.237
Experience because after that I met him for about five minutes, and then he went away to master and from Boston

00:55:51.238 --> 00:55:54.748
He sent me a telegram that mother we are waiting for you in Boston

00:55:55.388 --> 00:55:59.757
They said mother who is this one. I said he Steve I know him very well. I'm going down

00:56:00.488 --> 00:56:03.957
And they were surprised they said how will you recognize you've seen him only for five minutes?

00:56:03.957 --> 00:56:07.227
I said I recognize him don't you worry I'm going down there

00:56:08.558 --> 00:56:14.368
So you see all I can feel that also myself it in myself the person who's got it like I told you that

00:56:16.268 --> 00:56:20.128
It's in a part of the collective is the collectively part

00:56:23.258 --> 00:56:27.778
Because of collective consciousness you can feel another person and you can feel yourself

00:56:29.348 --> 00:56:33.267
But he's an experienced on your central nervous system is the thing

00:56:34.508 --> 00:56:41.217
But when you get joy, and when you get your awareness, it's a thing depending on the condition of yourself

00:56:42.788 --> 00:56:47.697
Mostly the West people first become aware you're aware they start seeing things better

00:56:48.457 --> 00:56:55.137
Those who have never noticed say for example a very nice curtain is lying here, but people will come see superficially go away

00:56:55.328 --> 00:57:01.828
But the sahaja yogi will see what a nice curtain what a nice pattern? What nice flowers what nice you see

00:57:02.738 --> 00:57:05.278
Penetration into everything it starts feeling everything

00:57:06.278 --> 00:57:09.058
Penetration is but experiences are different and different

00:57:09.788 --> 00:57:12.148
like I think everybody must write about

00:57:16.178 --> 00:57:18.657
Other a question that many people ask

00:57:19.568 --> 00:57:24.297
At such conferences is this is why in the past was it so easy?

00:57:25.088 --> 00:57:28.047
And so difficult, sorry, and why today, it's so easy

00:57:32.408 --> 00:57:34.408
That's not embarrassing to ask me

00:57:38.168 --> 00:57:41.367
But one should reach a conclusion there must be something about me

00:57:41.648 --> 00:57:45.688
That I do it that easily all right one point our second point could be

00:57:46.238 --> 00:57:48.238
explained with an analogy

00:57:48.338 --> 00:57:52.348
That in the beginning there are very few flower flowers on a tree

00:57:54.038 --> 00:57:56.038
Very few one or two

00:57:57.128 --> 00:58:03.928
Then when tree comes up in age and plus sometime starts as thousands so the time has come

00:58:04.748 --> 00:58:08.487
The time has come and I have come maybe that two things put together

00:58:10.298 --> 00:58:14.037
But maybe I know the trick of the trade better perhaps

00:58:18.068 --> 00:58:23.097
This is what I have discovered is our mas realization not individual, but

00:58:23.858 --> 00:58:25.178
Alma's

00:58:25.178 --> 00:58:29.188
That's what I have discovered if you want me to proclaim. I will proclaim that

00:58:30.128 --> 00:58:31.358
but

00:58:31.358 --> 00:58:33.038
There's nothing

00:58:33.038 --> 00:58:35.038
Great about it I think

00:58:36.428 --> 00:58:39.357
Because if you have something what is so great I?

00:58:41.978 --> 00:58:43.978
Am achieved nothing you have achieved

00:58:46.088 --> 00:58:51.898
That's the point is you have a dyad this with me you have achieved a

00:58:55.478 --> 00:58:58.318
Channel you must ask me some questions he say he's a barrister

00:59:36.128 --> 00:59:38.128
Miss lane miss lane

00:59:38.318 --> 00:59:45.208
How they form different different, that's a good point now you see inside why you get into the essence of everything?

00:59:45.908 --> 00:59:48.117
Say if you get to the essence of the three

00:59:49.268 --> 00:59:53.788
The easels or the SAP of the tree goes to every flower

00:59:56.558 --> 00:59:58.558
It doesn't discriminate

00:59:59.348 --> 01:00:01.348
But flowers are different

01:00:02.588 --> 01:00:10.438
Now what these people have done, they have plucked these flowers like somebody says this is my religion. This is pluck the flower

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:16.708
Then the flowers are dead now, so they are carrying on with dead flowers the religions are dead now

01:00:19.088 --> 01:00:21.718
But they are flowering on the same tree and

01:00:22.568 --> 01:00:29.698
You get inside the SAP through the root, so you see that everything is the same. It's just a manifestation of the same

01:00:30.398 --> 01:00:34.978
Now electricity is flowing it is giving you there. It is giving you a air conditioning

01:00:34.978 --> 01:00:39.117
It is working out there, but electricity is the same because you become the essence

01:00:41.348 --> 01:00:43.797
But when you see from outside they look different

01:00:47.438 --> 01:00:54.747
Especially when deliberately they have plucked out these flowers and established, this is mine Christ is mine how?

01:00:58.778 --> 01:01:00.778
Islam is mine how?

01:01:03.498 --> 01:01:10.808
It is not you cannot have them as properties they cannot be your property

01:01:14.508 --> 01:01:16.308
So this is what you realize

01:01:16.308 --> 01:01:22.688
And that's why you see that everything has the same you see because now you have become aneesa's new eyes have opened out you see

01:01:22.688 --> 01:01:25.747
That everything is the same you cannot become a fanatic now you cannot

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:29.918
Even if you try to be

01:01:32.328 --> 01:01:36.787
It just cannot become fanatic anymore because you see the essence is the same I

01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:43.298
Mean shoe got put into this you got put into that sugar put into that if you become the sugar you are

01:01:43.428 --> 01:01:45.428
Everything isn't it I?

01:01:46.008 --> 01:01:51.788
Mean religion had to be little different in its form because of the times that were there

01:01:52.368 --> 01:01:56.557
Times where this way that way you see every time they had to change the outward

01:01:56.658 --> 01:02:01.957
Form and things like that on social level and political level this that but he says was the same

01:02:16.368 --> 01:02:19.478
Of course you can't have it anymore

01:02:20.988 --> 01:02:28.117
That's very true because you see the essence is the same how can you see fanaticism comes from what finite we should say

01:02:29.478 --> 01:02:32.288
When you go into infinity how can you have fanaticism?

01:02:34.848 --> 01:02:41.647
You finite yourselves, I am these are these that is clubbing actually it is nothing but ordinary clubbing see

01:02:42.348 --> 01:02:46.057
we have clubs like somebody puts the say the

01:02:46.368 --> 01:02:51.458
Table where on the left side is one a club they put it on the right side another

01:02:51.828 --> 01:02:55.207
They distribute you see this is just like stupid clubbing that sorts

01:02:55.488 --> 01:03:03.397
You cannot club outcry God or Christ or any one of these incarnations? They are all brothers and sisters and relations of each other

01:03:07.188 --> 01:03:09.188
They are all related Legion

01:03:12.868 --> 01:03:14.958
But those people who were in charge

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:23.988
Try to destroy them as soon as possible I take the charge

01:03:26.668 --> 01:03:31.668
Christ Lee for four years how moments are believed. You know every one of them how they were tortured

01:03:32.188 --> 01:03:33.838
That's what happened

01:03:33.838 --> 01:03:36.108
Because they wanted to take advantage of that

01:03:39.238 --> 01:03:41.268
But forgive them now all right

01:03:47.488 --> 01:03:49.877
Any other question from you yes, yes

01:04:02.158 --> 01:04:04.158
Hungry should we approach?

01:04:04.348 --> 01:04:11.358
Seekers in these countries, which are not free such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia and in a way they're better off I did

01:04:12.418 --> 01:04:14.418
I've been to Russia

01:04:15.448 --> 01:04:17.448
I know they are not free

01:04:17.548 --> 01:04:19.727
But you see when freedom is

01:04:20.098 --> 01:04:26.538
One one should be able to very quickly see what is happening to the free countries today. If you see that warrant

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:29.728
If you go to America

01:04:29.728 --> 01:04:33.437
You can't wear your watch. You can't wear your bangles. You can't wear anything

01:04:34.578 --> 01:04:36.828
Maybe tomorrow they'll pull out your hair also

01:04:38.848 --> 01:04:44.178
It's such a chaotic country so this freedom also human beings cannot be in a way

01:04:44.998 --> 01:04:50.477
As far as other these free countries are I tell you the people are so simple I?

01:04:50.998 --> 01:04:54.258
Went to China I went to Russia because of my husband's job

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:58.217
I where all people are extremely simple the governments are not at all, right

01:04:59.668 --> 01:05:06.258
But it will take no time for you to ignite. No actually it is already gone in a way

01:05:10.548 --> 01:05:13.177
Logically they are understanding it now that sahaja yoga it

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:19.658
So it will come through Russia it will come through China from these bigger countries

01:05:21.348 --> 01:05:24.727
But what about the free countries first of all tell me about them

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.237
Free it's a license

01:05:43.308 --> 01:05:49.207
Because we will have people of that quality what we need is a transformation of human beings

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:53.977
Hypocrites talk of big big things cannot achieve anything isn't it?

01:05:54.947 --> 01:05:58.686
But the people who believe not believe but no as

01:05:59.838 --> 01:06:02.888
An actual thing that we are part and parcel of the whole

01:06:03.378 --> 01:06:09.427
Will not think of one government another government will think of one world the world

01:06:10.968 --> 01:06:16.478
All these so-called politics is because we are divided the nose is fighting guys eyes is fighting the years

01:06:17.028 --> 01:06:19.838
When they discover we are one body what is there to find?

01:06:21.828 --> 01:06:27.277
So most of the politics will be dissolved completely as it is now see look at us

01:06:28.427 --> 01:06:30.167
We have powers

01:06:30.167 --> 01:06:35.197
So we are capitalists, and we want to give it to others so we have communists already

01:06:38.238 --> 01:06:41.138
If you want to carry we don't want to conserve it

01:06:42.437 --> 01:06:44.437
So we are already

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:48.007
Doing the right thing the integration

01:06:48.677 --> 01:06:56.137
So all these problems come out of human beings and as soon as they become the spirit the problems will be dissolved

01:06:58.638 --> 01:07:05.857
Social problems see we have already solved so many social problems in sahaja yoga. We don't have problems what you normally see

01:07:06.528 --> 01:07:10.927
Our children are great our marriages are great. We are enjoying our lives

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:13.628
It's heavenly

01:07:17.748 --> 01:07:21.457
One or two mishaps are there doesn't matter but mostly

01:07:25.038 --> 01:07:31.987
We have a beautiful society no quarrel no jealousies no Fighting's no malice no hair trade nothing

01:07:36.618 --> 01:07:44.587
Isn't it great to have such a society and no dictation nothing absolutely free

01:07:51.228 --> 01:07:53.837
I know Mary. What did you want to ask?

01:08:13.588 --> 01:08:15.388
Why is it that people

01:08:15.388 --> 01:08:18.438
Are missing the chance they read the poster?

01:08:18.438 --> 01:08:23.448
and they walk by it happened to me in 82 I saw your poster I

01:08:42.178 --> 01:08:44.538
See people are some are very superficial

01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:48.108
Something known of themselves

01:08:48.148 --> 01:08:54.648
They think they don't need anything all kinds of things that I know I agree with you, but it happens yes, please

01:09:09.177 --> 01:09:11.177
What're you

01:09:11.728 --> 01:09:15.078
Saying that the advertising by the sahaja Yogi's

01:09:15.628 --> 01:09:21.167
For this program sounds a bit like an ad for instant coffee. He thinks it is instant coffee

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:26.868
But he's saying that

01:09:27.088 --> 01:09:32.567
CI tell you, but I tell you we buy instant coffee isn't it now in modern times everything is done

01:09:32.608 --> 01:09:34.608
so we had to have instant you about

01:09:35.518 --> 01:09:37.078
It is what to do

01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:41.898
It is but you see now we can say that you can get it after a lot of sufferings

01:09:42.058 --> 01:09:48.227
And you have to sacrifice the same sacrifice that all right, but it's not true now what?

01:09:48.838 --> 01:09:55.517
It is instant coffee, but we take instant coffee. We want everything instant in this modern time why not yoga

01:10:21.808 --> 01:10:23.808
So you tell us now how to advertise

01:10:25.918 --> 01:10:30.678
Yeah, you see what I'm saying that that's a fact. I really did it. That's a fact

01:10:31.738 --> 01:10:38.897
That's a fact the Kundalini. I call it a jet Kundalini in modern times really I'm myself surprised that it's working

01:10:39.628 --> 01:10:41.628
Just shoot wrong Oh

01:10:42.118 --> 01:10:44.357
thousands of people in India thousands

01:10:45.298 --> 01:10:47.218
See just shoot shuttle

01:10:47.218 --> 01:10:49.397
What am I to do it works like that?

01:10:49.398 --> 01:10:56.117
It's just I think the divine is anxious that let's have it down like that. It is in modern times. It's working very fast

01:10:56.728 --> 01:11:02.927
Not only me ask him how many people he has given realization every one of them have given to thousands

01:11:03.628 --> 01:11:06.587
realization I mean it seeing is believing but

01:11:07.828 --> 01:11:12.918
Advertising we do not know what to say now. What is it written here now?

01:11:13.648 --> 01:11:18.827
Perhaps thinks it's I don't know the English where it might be it's a little slick. It's a little smart, but

01:11:19.348 --> 01:11:20.368
or

01:11:20.368 --> 01:11:25.368
Something like that perhaps you mean more profound. Do you do you mean more deep more?

01:11:41.108 --> 01:11:44.698
Sounding like the other gurus that come I don't know about observables what they write

01:11:44.698 --> 01:11:48.087
But why don't you see tweet what you should write? I have no idea but

01:12:00.218 --> 01:12:06.447
What should we see what should we say here and now is a fact I tell you we need

01:12:11.048 --> 01:12:13.048
Now we can what should we say?

01:12:16.387 --> 01:12:18.387
All right

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:25.527
But what I am saying for people to be attractive what is saying that when you have to attract people from outside

01:12:26.617 --> 01:12:28.617
then we should put

01:12:31.387 --> 01:12:34.017
Try to change it, I don't know what

01:12:38.468 --> 01:12:39.767
I

01:12:39.767 --> 01:12:43.717
Think perhaps implied in Mary's question was is there a time?

01:12:43.847 --> 01:12:47.347
Is there a certain stage when you come to Santiago?

01:12:47.347 --> 01:12:51.877
Or is it that everybody should be brought in right now?

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:56.227
Do you reach a stage in your awareness where you're ready for it?

01:12:56.227 --> 01:13:03.007
Or is it something that you just come if the advertising department is good is it worth?

01:13:05.508 --> 01:13:09.608
You just I don't know what what what to say on this point because you

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:15.337
Cannot say certainly that people have to reach a certain stage because a person you see

01:13:15.468 --> 01:13:18.097
His wife brought her saying that he's the worst man

01:13:18.648 --> 01:13:22.987
He indulges in to this indulge us into that and all kinds of things bad

01:13:23.177 --> 01:13:26.317
Certificates about that fellow and as soon as he came in he got his realization

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.447
You see the really true IT

01:13:32.477 --> 01:13:35.587
People suffering from cancer got realization in no time

01:13:37.128 --> 01:13:42.067
So what is the stage I don't know, but maybe we can say the

01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:47.947
Attitude towards life maybe

01:13:50.088 --> 01:13:53.737
That's to towards life is you see say for example in the West

01:13:54.318 --> 01:14:00.487
like these BBC people telling me that if you say that it is without money nobody will listen to

01:14:01.218 --> 01:14:07.508
When I cannot say it is for money, that's one part. He said when you say free admission

01:14:08.658 --> 01:14:10.658
Things is useless

01:14:11.868 --> 01:14:16.988
The conditioning is so bad that if the free admission oh must be something funny

01:14:19.338 --> 01:14:21.338
This is what?

01:14:22.128 --> 01:14:28.597
Anglo-saxons brain cannot understand anything without money, can you imagine he told me frankly you said do you change this?

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:32.378
I said well. What should I say I don't take really you don't take any money what am I to say?

01:14:32.378 --> 01:14:37.567
This is what it is you see is the conditioning of the mind, but in in English is not so

01:14:39.287 --> 01:14:47.047
In India if you see from the villages they'll come on bullet cards, they'll have miles together they'll walk when they will know I'm going

01:14:51.128 --> 01:14:53.128
Also the knowledge is not here

01:14:53.768 --> 01:14:56.157
They don't have no background what I would say

01:14:57.038 --> 01:15:04.767
My background is needed, and I don't know the sensitivity is needed for Italians did not have the background, but sensitivity is their

01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:13.768
Worst reason I would say in Switzerland or America is the worst of all

01:15:14.558 --> 01:15:18.808
America fell for all kinds of guru because for sahaja yoga zero very bad

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:23.728
I'm sorry what it is. They don't look at sahaja yoga now

01:15:23.738 --> 01:15:28.288
They are after they have had all the experience of all the guru shopping

01:15:28.288 --> 01:15:34.317
They did now they're coming they want to do shopping. You know it's a fashion guru is a fashion

01:15:35.168 --> 01:15:37.168
It's nothing deep it's a fashion

01:15:37.598 --> 01:15:43.318
Going to this guru that will do that guru so how to talk to them they have money they want to shop it

01:15:45.218 --> 01:15:47.818
How many cover the worst of all I must say

01:15:49.088 --> 01:15:56.578
Experience wise supposed to be the most advanced most free country. They have the worst of all

01:15:58.958 --> 01:16:01.768
But in Austria I've seen the Falls are filled

01:16:02.738 --> 01:16:04.358
They're full

01:16:04.358 --> 01:16:08.998
In Austria we always get the how Falls are completely filled

01:16:09.968 --> 01:16:11.438
just like

01:16:11.438 --> 01:16:13.438
also in Italy

01:16:14.948 --> 01:16:22.347
There is never death of people. I mean people have to sit on the stairs in Austria isn't it we don't have that problem

01:16:23.528 --> 01:16:25.528
but getting realization

01:16:25.688 --> 01:16:28.317
Is not possible for everyone perhaps

01:16:30.098 --> 01:16:32.488
There's some sort of an understanding needed I

01:16:33.128 --> 01:16:37.587
can't explain why because the house are also lighted you see in the

01:16:38.258 --> 01:16:44.788
Halls are absolutely filled people sit on the stairs you see some are sitting outside some are standing on the street

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:50.458
Is there despite those facts there are sex and brain ceases?

01:16:52.298 --> 01:16:54.298
Did you write free

01:17:01.238 --> 01:17:07.738
Please come now gradually. They will see they have to learn their lessons a little bit more. I think that's all

01:17:09.248 --> 01:17:12.748
They have to learn their lessons a little bit more now you with you

01:17:12.748 --> 01:17:16.468
I'll tell you why because you are in the you and a big boss there

01:17:16.778 --> 01:17:19.077
Working in the you and itself's pulse your head

01:17:19.078 --> 01:17:22.528
I tell you I know my husband is there so I know all of them and

01:17:22.868 --> 01:17:25.977
Their heads get swollen up to see you and personalities

01:17:25.978 --> 01:17:32.338
And you are attending big conferences you see so-called big big people receive it because you see me to

01:17:33.278 --> 01:17:37.977
Be the big head these things do not go in so it's alright, but now you are alright

01:17:37.978 --> 01:17:42.508
But that is one of the things you want people bureaucrats at the worst of all

01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:49.618
There will be the last to come to sahaja yoga, my husband is a bit of that and I would deal with them

01:17:49.618 --> 01:17:53.037
I never talked to them about sahaja yoga, never never never

01:17:55.778 --> 01:17:59.608
Bureaucrats Anthony you see they they only want to serve government. That's all

01:18:00.188 --> 01:18:03.928
They don't understand anything. They are so bureaucracy is like that

01:18:05.168 --> 01:18:08.848
Now what else you have in Austria bureaucracy, then you have military

01:18:11.378 --> 01:18:13.378
Students

01:18:16.368 --> 01:18:18.368
Yes

01:18:42.738 --> 01:18:44.738
Why should you have to

01:18:44.988 --> 01:18:47.258
Do why should you have to rush it?

01:18:48.018 --> 01:18:53.437
There's no need at all I would be very happy if they don't worship like you see those who worship me

01:18:53.808 --> 01:18:55.897
And found out something good out of it

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.658
that's whatever so actually you know I hate that I

01:18:59.118 --> 01:19:04.868
Always see that these puja should be so much lengthy that I have some time to rest this

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:11.408
But I don't want them to worship me at all. It's very good. That's very good of them

01:19:11.408 --> 01:19:14.227
I tell you some of them when they touch my feet I get blisters

01:19:15.888 --> 01:19:19.867
Horrible as if yesterday. I was telling you like scorpion I

01:19:20.568 --> 01:19:23.438
get such big big blisters on my feet I

01:19:24.018 --> 01:19:26.497
Don't want them to wash it if you ask me

01:19:27.078 --> 01:19:30.428
But they would like to because you know what it means

01:19:31.008 --> 01:19:32.598
What's shipping me?

01:19:32.598 --> 01:19:34.598
You all know it very well

01:19:35.418 --> 01:19:37.418
What's shipping? What do you give me nothing?

01:19:38.388 --> 01:19:42.097
You just say certain mantras is that what do you give me nothing?

01:19:42.648 --> 01:19:46.958
That's nothing to worship me for example now see my photograph this one

01:19:49.398 --> 01:19:51.877
Is when I was sitting in a village

01:19:53.478 --> 01:19:58.868
When I entered the village I told him there is a very great soul who lived in this village

01:19:59.178 --> 01:20:02.167
They said there was one. He was a Muslim his name was Mia

01:20:03.618 --> 01:20:05.618
So I said now

01:20:06.198 --> 01:20:13.118
He must have been still here, and I sat down to be my lecture and I saw the spirit

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:18.337
Coming as a light of two. Hexa words to say on top of my head

01:20:18.338 --> 01:20:19.388
I saw it right

01:20:19.388 --> 01:20:25.687
but you can't see I mean people can't see but camera captured it the camera captured it and

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:31.268
Then the the sun's rays through that prism like spirit

01:20:31.908 --> 01:20:36.127
Started coming as all seven colours on me. I could see

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:43.878
I could see then I was very happy with increasing in this report, but nobody could see and then I said alright now

01:20:43.878 --> 01:20:46.007
It's more than sufficient like that I said

01:20:46.557 --> 01:20:51.977
But nobody can see it now. What's this am I telling them that yeah, you should see because you will not see

01:20:54.568 --> 01:21:01.967
So why'd you tell anybody about my worshipping also till they understand it, but the camera caught it. What can I do?

01:21:03.868 --> 01:21:06.557
And what the camera caught it I didn't say

01:21:08.818 --> 01:21:11.237
Why do they worship Christ I've never seen in you

01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:19.697
Why do they worship Christ murder they have never seen her what did she do she was just crying all her life

01:21:19.698 --> 01:21:23.628
she didn't give realization to anybody even Christ did not give realization to

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:28.607
Anyone why do they worship him

01:21:30.718 --> 01:21:32.898
You are a Christian you should ask them a question

01:21:37.318 --> 01:21:39.318
Why do the Muslims worship Kaaba

01:21:45.798 --> 01:21:51.168
But in sahaja yoga, I am a discovery for you. I never asked anyone to worship me never, baba

01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:53.668
It's horrible for me

01:21:53.668 --> 01:22:00.377
I have frightened of people trying to worship me because you see I have to take up everything of the stuff in everything that you

01:22:03.478 --> 01:22:06.917
Well yeah, they can tell me you that I just don't like it

01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:13.188
And I want to make a big gaps in between you see so that at least have some time to rest

01:22:13.348 --> 01:22:16.368
Do something the whole thing digest it and take it out

01:22:17.788 --> 01:22:23.207
So you need not tell them at all in the beginning you should not tell them anything concerns that you are great come along

01:22:23.848 --> 01:22:25.848
Let them have the realization

01:22:26.218 --> 01:22:28.218
then if they're saying

01:22:30.118 --> 01:22:35.237
Then we should consider whether they should worship me or not and everybody is not allowed to worship also

01:22:37.738 --> 01:22:40.548
Do you know that Mary we don't allow everyone to come

01:22:41.488 --> 01:22:44.118
You have to be a clean person, otherwise they are not allowed

01:22:45.298 --> 01:22:50.178
So the this worship is your privilege not mind by any chance. I tell you

01:22:52.798 --> 01:22:56.928
Any chance and which you will all say that mother is chance it I

01:22:57.778 --> 01:23:03.048
Really, shun it and these false gurus because nothing happens to them they like it so

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.957
There's no explanation for this it is to be seen

01:23:10.378 --> 01:23:11.898
if they come to sahaja, yoga

01:23:11.898 --> 01:23:18.587
They can see it very well unless until they come in it you should not talk of me as anything as incarnation anything

01:23:18.588 --> 01:23:23.958
Just don't talk you should not tell them how to worship or anything just tell them that you have to get your realization

01:23:24.838 --> 01:23:28.277
Let them first open their eyes then talk to them about these things

01:23:28.588 --> 01:23:33.768
In the beginning if you start talking they will be stuck no doubt they are stuck because they have not reached that thought

01:23:36.748 --> 01:23:40.248
They have to be seaworthy to be in the sea isn't it

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:45.018
Yes

01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:55.067
Nothing is needed to begin with actually and I don't want anything really

01:23:58.168 --> 01:24:00.168
If there is anything that

01:24:00.928 --> 01:24:04.608
Is to be done is to give realization to everyone, that's all

01:24:05.668 --> 01:24:07.668
but to progress further

01:24:08.098 --> 01:24:10.048
They have to worship

01:24:10.048 --> 01:24:12.228
They will worship somebody who is dead and gone

01:24:13.828 --> 01:24:18.078
They never worship Christ when he lived they never worshipped his mother when he lived she lived

01:24:18.288 --> 01:24:24.497
They never worship drama. They never worship, Krishna now when they are dead were nice to worship because they are stones now

01:24:24.498 --> 01:24:26.498
What can they do to you?

01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:31.187
That's human nature when somebody is dead

01:24:32.098 --> 01:24:36.797
Then be perfect all right the ones who crucified Christ have raised these churches

01:24:42.538 --> 01:24:45.587
When person leaves you see in the present you never appreciate

01:24:52.898 --> 01:24:59.458
Because we don't allow anybody to worship, also. It's very it's a great privilege for anyone to be there

01:25:00.608 --> 01:25:02.287
You know that?

01:25:02.287 --> 01:25:04.287
It's not for everyone so

01:25:04.537 --> 01:25:09.447
Many people have been denied in England and all that just now you have to prepare yourself

01:25:10.988 --> 01:25:12.988
Everywhere

01:25:14.138 --> 01:25:18.358
And yesterday I was telling me know that you should not have brought clad lady. She was no good

01:25:19.118 --> 01:25:21.118
The one who was your roommate Oh?

01:25:22.537 --> 01:25:28.767
Was pestering you I said, she was very caught up, and you should not have brought her from the Buddhist that disturbs me

01:25:33.548 --> 01:25:39.597
It's very significant, but like a person who has to be a postgraduate student to understand certain things

01:25:40.327 --> 01:25:44.277
You have to be a postgraduate in sahaja yoga to be in aversion

01:25:46.057 --> 01:25:53.817
Otherwise you should not so you don't stock of these things. It'll get stuck no doubt when I have no doubts about it

01:25:56.738 --> 01:25:58.738
Anybody would get stuck

01:25:59.528 --> 01:26:06.838
Because looks so funny isn't it that you have to worship another human being it is so we have to use discretion

01:26:10.478 --> 01:26:15.177
Anybody would be stuck that way unless until you are a first-class sahaja yogi

01:26:15.178 --> 01:26:20.128
And you understand the value of it you have gone deep into it. Then only you realize

01:26:22.298 --> 01:26:24.298
It's to be appreciated

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:37.146
I never talked about me at all to anyone now. I really some Saints started talking about me

01:26:39.017 --> 01:26:41.916
Some Saints only told some people that this is this

01:26:42.737 --> 01:26:45.697
Then they came and asked me and I said all right you find out for yourself

01:26:51.408 --> 01:26:56.948
You see with human beings you have to be very very careful and cautious, I do not want to get crucified

01:26:58.517 --> 01:26:59.928
See

01:26:59.928 --> 01:27:06.607
To be very very cautious with them because ego is the first thing they come in they don't understand. What is beneficial for them

01:27:07.158 --> 01:27:12.127
See what did Christ do to them did he ruin them, or do any bad to them, but they crucified him isn't it?

01:27:12.647 --> 01:27:14.647
They gave poison to Muhammad SAW

01:27:15.587 --> 01:27:17.617
Why what was the thing?

01:27:18.527 --> 01:27:21.037
Because he go so should we calculate

01:27:23.297 --> 01:27:29.677
Even when you write supposing in your wherever you write should write it cautiously she make it so that

01:27:30.468 --> 01:27:33.637
According to your own understanding that they come to my program

01:27:34.698 --> 01:27:36.468
Use your wisdom

01:27:36.468 --> 01:27:38.857
What you want to put it how to put it?

01:27:39.857 --> 01:27:45.907
or if you want to say you can say that at the first instance the Kundalini rises and

01:27:46.547 --> 01:27:50.017
Then you have to grow into it if you don't want to say quick

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:55.928
instant coffee business, so you may say like this that might might reprise I

01:27:56.448 --> 01:27:58.448
Would suggest that way?

01:27:59.357 --> 01:28:01.387
All right that you turn

01:28:01.388 --> 01:28:05.917
But with the people some of the very deep people they just get realization in

01:28:06.167 --> 01:28:10.657
Thousand it because they have been deep people all their lives not life, but lies

01:28:11.567 --> 01:28:13.567
So they just hit it

01:28:16.428 --> 01:28:21.818
So it attracts people who are superficial then it's not a good thing to say

01:28:29.448 --> 01:28:33.038
That may be one of the reasons that only superficial come to our program

01:28:35.628 --> 01:28:39.668
We should find out how to write that the deep people are attracted

01:28:40.338 --> 01:28:46.597
Isn't it we should find out ways and methods by deep people are attracted not superficial I?

01:28:48.138 --> 01:28:51.668
Gave you the whole gets filled up because maybe superficial

01:28:53.418 --> 01:28:59.647
Like a saint on see nobody buys anything. It's just to say law and everybody comes to see the same

01:29:04.278 --> 01:29:06.697
This is Kali why is he this is a

01:29:07.548 --> 01:29:12.608
Confused state in this. This is a this is the age of confusion

01:29:19.338 --> 01:29:22.177
This is the age of confusion really?

01:29:26.358 --> 01:29:32.858
Also some people say that why should I give realization? I said better you give very good idea

01:29:33.098 --> 01:29:35.098
I would like to return

01:29:35.778 --> 01:29:39.818
See this is ego. Isn't it? Why should you do it?

01:29:39.818 --> 01:29:45.367
I mean I'm doing it because I do it alright, but if you can do it nothing like it. I'll return

01:29:45.408 --> 01:29:47.408
I'll be very happy I

01:29:49.248 --> 01:29:56.107
Mean my age has is beyond doubt retirement I would have retired long time back see going on and on

01:30:02.208 --> 01:30:05.317
So also you should see the people who they are and

01:30:06.048 --> 01:30:07.938
Then talk to them

01:30:07.938 --> 01:30:11.827
Must use discretion very important to use discretion

01:30:15.588 --> 01:30:20.588
As he said it may be some people may not get it in this lifetime, maybe next time

01:30:22.338 --> 01:30:26.768
Also it happens that the seer some

01:30:28.038 --> 01:30:32.587
people get realization say for example and the transform and

01:30:33.408 --> 01:30:35.408
become something very beautiful

01:30:35.988 --> 01:30:38.858
Then the mediocre mediocre people you see

01:30:39.648 --> 01:30:42.127
May see that and try to follow it

01:30:43.758 --> 01:30:45.758
The mediocre may try to follow it

01:30:49.098 --> 01:30:53.978
Like when I went to Italy this gentleman was a very famous person who interviewed me

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:57.338
He said first you give me realization then I'll Italy

01:31:00.498 --> 01:31:02.268
Because

01:31:02.268 --> 01:31:06.907
Perhaps he believed in me whatever. It was or may not have believed might be doubting whatever it is

01:31:07.098 --> 01:31:09.848
He got his realization, then he started laughing

01:31:11.057 --> 01:31:15.067
And he said also, I've got it now. I said yes, you got it now

01:31:15.068 --> 01:31:19.807
It is he who is organizing all this thing so maybe like this it might forgot

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:23.798
Depends all you see human beings are quite complicated in modern times

01:31:25.698 --> 01:31:31.807
Very difficult to hold on to them if you give them this they'll come this way if you give them that they'll come this way

01:31:32.088 --> 01:31:34.088
Just I don't want to have it

01:31:36.268 --> 01:31:41.027
Just some hooks or excuses it's terrible I know

01:31:42.358 --> 01:31:44.748
Especially in the West it's very difficult

01:31:48.688 --> 01:31:52.217
But they'll accept her something stupid like Punk's

01:31:53.698 --> 01:31:55.698
Thanks you will find thousands now

01:31:58.168 --> 01:32:04.697
People in very high positions are punks now. Can you believe it imagine our Prime Minister going as a punk?

01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:09.708
They accept stupid things without any questioning

01:32:11.787 --> 01:32:14.717
Think of it drugs for example

01:32:18.418 --> 01:32:22.938
They accept it without any understanding without any asking and very

01:32:24.028 --> 01:32:25.618
educated

01:32:25.618 --> 01:32:27.618
highly placed people doing

01:32:27.988 --> 01:32:29.988
Absurd things like that

01:32:30.807 --> 01:32:34.607
Alcoholism womanizing everything all nonsensical things

01:32:38.128 --> 01:32:42.737
But to do something good to yourself it takes time a

01:32:45.748 --> 01:32:47.927
Very self-destructive by temperament

01:32:49.378 --> 01:32:51.708
Just do something nice to ourselves

01:32:53.218 --> 01:32:55.907
To get some blessings upon ourselves yes

01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:05.577
We'll be all right

01:33:06.877 --> 01:33:11.937
They have to learn their lessons that's collecting as they have to learn their lesson

01:33:19.267 --> 01:33:21.267
Satisfied

01:33:22.477 --> 01:33:25.017
I'm happy he's a very wise man

01:33:25.017 --> 01:33:30.686
He's done the homework the other people just came just like any that for fuck out you see it's a deep subject

01:33:31.147 --> 01:33:33.147
It's a very deep subject

01:33:33.428 --> 01:33:35.198
you cannot just

01:33:35.198 --> 01:33:37.198
Up here and go out

01:33:41.587 --> 01:33:43.587
Steve are you going to?

01:34:21.548 --> 01:34:24.447
Put this into the world

01:34:45.218 --> 01:34:47.667
No, but you see well one point

01:34:47.667 --> 01:34:52.586
I see in is what he's saying that one of the things this really come to my mind is this

01:34:52.747 --> 01:34:55.617
That this may be that we get superficial people

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:04.198
So we should put something deep in it because it's very deep experience

01:35:07.988 --> 01:35:12.508
Suggestion you see there is something which explains certain things

01:35:14.557 --> 01:35:20.186
They like my lectures all right, they like to listen to my lecture because you see it appeals to them mind

01:35:20.707 --> 01:35:25.287
But they don't get realization so that means they are not very deep

01:35:39.997 --> 01:35:41.997
Yes, that is one thing yeah

01:35:42.517 --> 01:35:46.557
Now for example in Switzerland we put our these things

01:35:47.318 --> 01:35:52.797
Nobody removed it still their last three years. It is there. It's very surprising in Switzerland

01:35:52.798 --> 01:35:56.907
Where people are so meticulous they have kept my photographs?

01:35:58.267 --> 01:36:00.158
In Italy us

01:36:00.158 --> 01:36:02.607
All my three year old photographs are there

01:36:03.727 --> 01:36:10.257
It is there. What about also I must say that advertising whatever it was in

01:36:13.388 --> 01:36:15.388
Australia

01:36:16.207 --> 01:36:18.207
Australia is

01:36:18.397 --> 01:36:20.397
very progressive in such

01:36:21.068 --> 01:36:23.048
Australians imagine

01:36:23.048 --> 01:36:25.048
Can you believe it that they were?

01:36:25.178 --> 01:36:30.057
Sent there as criminals their forefathers and today. They are the ones who are going to take everyone to

01:36:30.607 --> 01:36:32.557
spirituality

01:36:32.557 --> 01:36:34.557
So how can you say good and bad?

01:36:37.448 --> 01:36:39.127
Australia is the best

01:36:39.127 --> 01:36:41.127
Well Stella is the best now I?

01:36:41.857 --> 01:36:50.297
Mean in progress. We have the leader from Australia for the Warren started the whole thing and we have James has he come

01:36:59.618 --> 01:37:01.918
May God bless you may God bless you
