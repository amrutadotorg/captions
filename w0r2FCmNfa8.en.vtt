00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.720
- condition like Queenstown's Gorbachev
- Annh? He is a realized soul.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.540
He's born a realized soul. It's a, it's a state of mind which is spiritual

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.720
and where your spirit is in your attention. So in that light you see wisdom.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.640
You're compassioned and you're very sensible and dynamic

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.620
and you do not [UNCLEAR - DETER?] for using it. Apart from that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.080
it gives you a great concern for the masses and you don't mind rectifying anything that is wrong

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.620
and also you feel very,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.340
- I should say, powerful - the power of love.
- Right. Do You think Gorbachev

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.740
- has all these qualities?
- I think, he has many.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm going to meet him this time when I go there. I mean, I've been missing him and he's been missing Me - it's like that but

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.760
he has seen the point quite alright that this kind of an extreme

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.360
regimentation of communism he doesn't help. Also he sees the point, what's wrong with democracy

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.300
so he doesn't want to go to that extent of democratic life like America is, where it's complete abandonment and

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.640
they have got so many problems because of this kind of freedom which is just licence.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.640
So he's a biased person and he's very righteous in his own character, everything, extremely righteous man.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.160
Like a, you see, I should say that, Socrates says, described that, "We should have benevolent kings," you see.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.880
So he believes in benevolence and the way how he has uh.. crossed all these hurdles one by one,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.160
-  is very surprising.
- Hmm and he's probably changed the world more than any other person.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.460
- Yes, he's so courageous.
- In his generation.
- He's very courageous and whenever I go to Russia -

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.800
I mean, you'll be amazed to know that there are 16000, 14000 people - we always take a stadium

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.860
and I always talk about him. Nobody objected to what I said about him.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.000
He has that leadership in him but is for the world to understand

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.340
how we have to change ourselves and come to some middle point - not to go to extremes of anything.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.100
He also is very spiritual - very spiritual man and he arranged lots of yoga seminars there,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.860
he called lots of people from outside, everything but it so happened that when I was there, he was not there sometimes.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.260
- You will see him next time.
- Yeah, of course.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.220
What do You, how do You judge somebody's spiritual, whether they're very spiritual or not?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.720
- Is it a feeling You get or?
- No, you see, everybody has Divinity within themselves. Everybody is spiritual

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.720
but only thing is that when you get connected to that All-Pervading power

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.720
then you start emitting cool vibrations from your being which can be felt on your Central Nervous system.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.360
- Yeah.
- You can feel on your
- finger-tips.
- finger-tips but for Me I can just feel it as it is.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.720
- Can You feel from other people?
- Yeah, yes, just like that. You see, as soon as I saw

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.440
Gorbachev on the television, I said, "We've done it now."

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.580
So you have to have uh.. that kind of sensitivity, just to judge it

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.680
but otherwise all of them can judge it. If they ask just a question, "Is Gorbachev a realized soul?" it works.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.740
- Really?
- Yeah. You can ask the question and they get the cool breeze in their hands.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.700
- My! Okay.
- Because you get the Absolute answers because you, Spirit is the Absolute -

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.140
it gives you Absolute; All of them will feel the same way about a person.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.280
and I think, now in the world there is an awakening going on that we should take to Spiritual life - everywhere.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.480
But I was surprised that in Russia, where they never talked of God, never talked of religion,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.520
how people are so clean! Because they have no conditionings. You see, we have conditionings of this religion and this and that

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.840
and they have deviated from right paths - they have deviated. They are not on the right paths, you see. Whatever was preached by their

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.660
Incarnations or say, prophets or anyone - they didn't carry on that.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.020
Is it because they had some sort of religious innocence because they haven't had - religion wasn't legal?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.180
- [UNCLEAR]
- You see, it is because it went into the hands of people who are really not authorised.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.380
Christ has said that, "You're to be born again," that means something has to happen to you.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.340
But they did not try that. You see, they just

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.680
started, "Alright, we'll organize now." Without having that connection how can you do it?

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.460
- My! Have You, have You met the Queen?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.100
- Yeah, of course I've met her.
- Yeah. How did You feel who was spiritual?

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.760
She's a very sweet person, extremely sweet, very humble, very sweet, nice person

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.380
and she has tendencies towards Spirituality, no doubt

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:15.060
and I'm going to meet now Prince of Wales when I'm going to England. He wants to meet Me for some purpose.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.100
Then I'll see if he comes to sahaja yoga. She's a very open-minded lady, extremely open-minded.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.740
and she has respect, a very sweet person.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:37.060
Right! Other members of Your family are there any restrictions [UNCLEAR - STAND OFFICE?]

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.960
- uh.. being Your Spiritual people
- Even the, this gentleman from New Zealand

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.620
Cowley, he was quite spiritual but I don't know

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.060
he fell into some sort of a social problem -

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.424
- of conscience problem something - he's also another one.

00:07:01.424 --> 00:07:02.780
- Is he? Right.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:10.320
- Yes. Even our Rajiv Gandhi is but he also feel a trap into wrong advice, perhaps -

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.100
he's also a realized soul. Even the uh..

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.160
head of the new party that's coming up, he's also a realized soul.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.220
- So many are coming up like that, I don't know how.
- Hmm!

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:34.780
- Have You met our Bob Hawk?
- I haven't met him as yet.
- Yeah. Have You met any of the australian politicians?

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.220
- Not of that level.
- No
- All those who came in My husband's office, mostly shipping people

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.360
Western shipping, they're changing so fast - you know - by the time I come here, they're changed.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.180
- [LAUGHTER] And they will be the time you come next time too.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.860
You can't just locate them. I want to meet - they're changed.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.700
- I can believe that. And what about American Presidents? Do any stand out in Your

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.280
- Abraham Lincoln, of course.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.680
He was great, no doubt, very great.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:22.160
Lenin was also, you'll be surprised, was a realized soul but they dragged him into party and they also

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:31.060
What he said was, "We should achieve at stateless state," that's absolutely what we are doing - stateless state. People should be

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.800
just angelic - doesn't become like that, you have to be that state.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:44.640
Even I feel, the most of her laws are for angels, not for ordinary persons.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:53.620
- And you worked, when you were young, with Gandhi.
- Yes, I did.
- What was he like?
- He's wonderful person.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:02.860
He was so concerned about people, concerned about our country, for its Independence - a very Spiritual personality

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:10.560
and he knew Me what I was and he consulted Me at a very young age about his bhajans, you see, the

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.620
hymns, how to write, in what series he should write.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:25.520
But very disciplined fellow, very extremely disciplined and he wanted everybody to be very disciplined and

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:35.740
he said, "We have to win the freedom and for that we have to be disciplined." And he said, "First thing first. First

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.340
we must have our freedom. Without freedom, what is Spirituality of a slave."

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.580
So, if he was living, he would have definitely worked with us but [UNCLEAR]

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.720
- And this Mister
- Do you have questions?

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.040
- Till I am doing with her,
- I have to think of s ome more
- you see.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.300
- Martin Luther King
- Yeah, beautiful! 
- He was a realized soul.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:17.340
- Was he?
- Yeah, he was also a realized soul. Tremendous person.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:27.360
The thing with, with realized souls in politics, Shree Mataji, You often said is this, that they have the vision that unrealized people don't.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:34.720
Lenin had the vision of collectivity, Martin Luther King had the vision of saving the soul of humanity

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.720
irreceptive races, but its this vision we get through realization - isn't it?

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:49.060
Yes, of course, I mean, they have not only vision but they have the Absolute Truth with them and they are so wedded to it

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:56.780
- innately they get wedded to  the Truth. Said, they will not do all these nonsensical things that politicians are doing because

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.780
they're not insecured, they're not counting their merits what position they occupy

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.140
so they're not bothered about this maintaining the position - they'll be there, in any case, whatever one may try.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:18.240
And their apart from the collective vision, you see, they can penetrate

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.920
into problems much better than anybody else can because they see the problems from a detached mind;

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.440
- They're not involved into it so they can solve it much better.
- Right.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.280
- You've met, You've met the pope, didn't You?
- I did.
- The recent pope, the last one?
- The last one.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.400
- The last one? Right.
 - I met him because we had gone to Poland

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:49.980
and I said, "I would like to see some churches," because I'm fond of architecture so they sent Me to Krakow where he was there

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:58.680
and they held a mass for Me because I was supposed to be VIP and all that and then after that we had tea together. We're sitting, I raised his Kundalini and all that.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:07.500
It came up, it worked out but again it settled back. He asked Me about India, this, that but nothing about Spirituality.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:18.020
So sometimes it again comes up, goes down. Then I wrote a letter to one of the boys

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:26.480
that, "I met a gentleman, a cardinal there and I saw the black Mary, because I was there in September and very bad

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:33.740
- time that September was when the 1st of September WARSAW was bombed.
- Ah, yes, right.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.820
So while going to Warsaw I felt extremely sad and I said, "Why I feel so sad here?"

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.980
My husband said, "Why are You looking sad?" I said, "Never I feel that sad as I'm feeling now."

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:50.440
Then we got down we found out that it was the day that it was bombed. And 8th of September is the

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:59.440
birth of Mother Mary so they have a black Madonna. They take out a procession - I saw that also and that's the time I met

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:07.640
this pope. Then this gentleman whom I had written this letter, because he was also born on 8th of September, so I had just written to him.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:15.140
- He said that, "Do You know, the same gentleman now has become the pope?"
- Interesting.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.700
- Do birth dates have a special
- Yes, of course, it's quite a lot.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.000
Birthday is very significant about

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.060
anyone but specially for people who are spiritual, very significant

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:41.300
They're born at a time when certain stars are there and there's some truth in it.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.080
- They have predicted about Me quite a lot and it'll see now
- We heard that the other day Shree Mataji
- They did

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.100
- Yes [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR] things, annh?
- Let us see it works out.
- What have they predicted?

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.580
I mean, that sahaja yoga will spread such a lot and people will be

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:11.300
changed and transformation will take place and that even politics will take over sahaja yoga and all that - quite a lot, I mean.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:19.200
- [UNCLEAR - CHHETI?] I'll give you a copy of that
- and this man who has done it he's not a sahaja yogi and he himself is now surrendered

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.660
because when he saw My horoscope. There are horoscopes and horoscopes. There's one predicted with somebody who -

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:35.040
what was the - Krishnamurthy and according to him they calculated something. Now he's this one, R.V. Raman

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:41.860
who is a very well-known uh.. astrologer - he's no more.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:49.480
According to his astrology, this gentleman, Mr. Bhandari - he's also well-known - has predicted all these things.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.680
'Sahaja yoga will become the, the principal belief system of the world

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.580
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- In certain stages.' 1996 was a very big stage.
- Yeah.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:07.020
I think, 1993 is also important as I'll be 70 years of age that time.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.600
- Two years more.
- I wouldn't admit that sort of thing.
- [LAUGHTER] Shree Mataji doesn't look it though.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.480
I don't know anything about it, it's just like that is, I don't know.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.840
- But, when You started this In 1970 You decided that You wanted to

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.120
- help enlighten, perhaps or teach.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:45.160
- No, this was actually from My very childhood I knew I had to do this work
- Did You?
- because formerly, you see, it was the

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.580
tradition that only one master will have one disciple

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.140
but in the 12th century there was one great saint in India called as Gyaneshwara.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:05.320
He took permission from his guru - his brother himself was the guru - that, "You just allow me to write about it openly

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:13.360
because everybody's said about it but nobody's said how it will work out so why not let me, at least, write something about it."

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:21.020
So he was the first who wrote it in a book called 'Gyaneshwari', which is actually a book on Gita.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:29.100
In that he wrote in the sixth chapter that, "There is a power like this which will rise and which will give Self-realization and things like that."

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:38.240
This was written in many Sanskrit books long time back. It's 14000 years back Markandaya wrote, I mean, so it's a very old

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:46.000
theme, worked out by very few people but in our own

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:51.240
language like Marathi or Hindi which we speak, it was not available.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:59.520
So he's the first one who told to the masses about this and it had to be worked out in such a way to be proved.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.240
So, when I was born I knew this was My own mission.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.940
My father also knew; He was also a realized soul,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:18.600
so he told Me that, "Don't talk about religion, don't talk about anything, just now You find out how to give realization

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:27.140
to masses, not one but to masses." So then, I used to -

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:36.260
"So they, they also can do it, enter into Your being, You see what's wrong with You, what's wrong with him, what's wrong." So then I worked out.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:45.460
Till 47 years of age I was busy finding out. Then I worked it out what is the permutation and combination is.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.420
Now the last center was not opened, all of them were open. Kundalini, I could do it, with that the last was to be opened out.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.300
That I did on the 5th May, 1970, early in the morning.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:08.920
That time I saw this horrible Rajneesh, you see, mesmerising people. By chance I was there just to see what is here.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:16.540
When I saw that, you see, just I thought better start it now. So first I gave realization to only one lady,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:24.040
then to one gentleman and then twelve people got realization. That's how slowly it started.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:32.420
Gosh! and how many people would have received realization now? What do you think, in the world

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.800
- how many would there be?
- I don't know. At least tens of thousands, pushing a hundred thousand -

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.620
- maybe more than a hundred thousand - God knows
- Bad at accounts.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:54.440
Can't just say because this is sahaja yoga is not a communication, it's not an organization -

00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.720
it is how way you practice it - you just can't say how many practice it.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:09.040
This, this ability, I've never heard about it that You talk, to look into people and find out what's wrong with them; I mean, You can do this.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:16.160
- Well, all of them can do.
- All of us can do. We can read the chakras on our hands
- On their hands they can

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:22.480
- The sensations we get.....
- That's what is Collective Consciousness which Yung has talked about - you must have heard about Yung.
- Yeah

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:29.500
-  Hume has talked about it
- Yeah
- That's same thing, same thing that you develop that new awareness, a new dimension

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:38.040
- in your awareness on your Central Nervous System
- When You're going to Beta uh.. how many people get into Beta

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.660
- waves they can do this - is that alright?
- Yes. We've had some studies done recently Shree Mataji

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.440
that article, we've got copies in the paper - in fact its included in that package we've got,

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:59.060
that the symptomatic of the steady meditation state is the vastly increasaed Beta emanation.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.620
and there is other things that go on with it.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:09.060
- Essentially what happens is that when the Kundalini is raised you are then in meditation
- Well

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:16.240
and how much you develop that and how much you learn to use that awareness, is then up to you. So that's kind of two questions

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.860
as who has had their Kundalini raised, which could be hundreds of thousands of people by now and they could have done nothing more with it

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:29.220
that is surprised more in number than actually stuck to it. They meditate everyday, learnt how to use their

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:36.520
finger chakra monitoring system and actually increase their sensitivity to the extent that they're now vibrationally aware

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:42.180
in everyday. This is what Shree Mataji teaches us to work on very much to

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:48.180
develop our awareness so that we can perceive things through vibrations principally rather than through other means

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:56.180
It works both ways - you see, we have to feel our depth so like a tree has to grow outward, the same way when you start working on others

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:02.060
you start moving outwards and depth starts increasing and once you

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.180
touch your Divinity within you, then you're there - no problem.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:15.920
- Yeah, right. [LAUGHTER]
- I'm only sorry that I'm meeting her after such a long time.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:24.740
I've been here many a times, you see and I wish we could have met earlier we would have done such a lot for Australia.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.840
- Hopefully it can happen now.
- Huh?
- We hope it can happen now.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:37.240
- It should. I mean, first of all there were so many horrible gurus here; You had so many horrible people working.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.320
Even now, I think, there are some already at it.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:49.840
One thing you must tell them that you cannot pay for your ascent. It's a

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:58.180
living process of a living energy of evolution

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.440
and you can't pay for that. Now, you may pay for a house or for a

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.580
aeroplane tickets, that's different but you can't pay for this.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:20.300
What stage would You feel that You've achieved Your goal? Will it be when,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.440
when how many people are received realization?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:33.640
With that in two stages we move. First stage is we call as thoughtless awareness

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:41.820
where you can silence your thoughts and you can watch, just watch - that's you are in the present now,

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:50.240
neither in the past nor in the future. Then this state develops into another state, what you call as, doubtless awareness -

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.840
then you have no doubts about [UNCLEAR], no problems

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:03.960
and you yourself know that this is so; The certificate comes from you, from no body else.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:10.440
Everybody has improved like that, everybody; Even Jason, ask him, he will also tell you the same.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:18.440
I wonder whether I, this is a very hypnotic way, isn't it? [LAUGHTER]

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.780
Yes, yes, it's a very nice hypnotism [LAUGHTER]

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:30.540
So, in hypnosis, you see, you actually put some sort of a spirit in the person.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
There's no modus operandi - you don't know how it has happened but in sahaja yoga you know each and everything;

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:44.440
How the Kundalini rises, where is the Kundalini, how to raise it, what's the problem of a particular person.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.940
It's the Parasympathetic Nervous System which you nourish about which doctors don't know anything.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.560
So, if you talk to a doctor will understand or an engineer will understand that this is complete engineering.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.960
So the modus operandi is completely explained and proved.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:12.240
It's not just talking, it's proved. Now supposing, some people say there's no God.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:19.540
Alright, doesn't matter - raise their Kundalini. Ask a question, "Is there God?" - finished.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:26.980
Then the cool breeze says yes. But supposing, there's a cheat and you say, "Is he Godly?"

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:32.020
Immediately you might feel hot, sometimes you get a blister with such a person.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:40.880
Relatively you should see. Supposing, there's a cancer patient. I put My hands towards a cancer patient - immediately you'll feel the heat of the cancer patient.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:47.780
That's how you can find out what's wrong with this person, what's wrong with another person.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:54.280
Now only thing, if you know how to correct those centers, person is cured.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.920
- If you know how to
- correct those subtle centers
- Right
- which are indicated on your finger-tips

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:09.540
- Right.
- then if you know how to do that through the awakening of the Kundalini, then you cure that person.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:16.940
There are things, ways in which we can work on each chakra to clear out dead energy, that may be blocking the chakra and to get it into working again

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:24.700
- and the state of the chakra is the origin of disease or health
- hmm
- [UNCLEAR] so we can work on the chakras and [UNCLEAR]

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:33.500
So now for hypnosis, supposing I hypnotize him, supposing,  he won't be able to tell you what it is about.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.420
He will not have any knowledge about it and it's such a subtle knowledge but you ask any sahaja yogi, they all know about it.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.740
They know how to work it out, they know how to give awakening, they know how to cure, they know everything.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:52.500
Such a subtle subject has become so easy for them

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:59.820
because they have that light, I can say, and that

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.220
understanding, that feeling by which they can judge it.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:16.260
- Can I, can I ask Your followers, You
- Annh?
- what difference it's made to their life? Do they..

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:23.600
- Yes, please ask.
- Can you tell me what difference it made to your life?
- Oh, its really trasformed it 
- How's it transformed it

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:31.700
Basically, uh, I was very, very... very aggressive and uh,

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:38.600
I'm trying to use words to you, not sahajayoga words

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.780
Very greedy, very rough, harsh

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.040
Lots of things like that, and that's balanced a lot more than I was then.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:57.280
And uh, also I was known to suffer from myositis [unclear]

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.340
Nerve, tendons between all the muscles [unclear]

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:10.760
and thats all gone, and I used to have a chiropractor every week, sometimes twice a week and I had for about 11 years.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:19.160
-just totally in good health, you know, and I hadn't been sick, apart from a cold [unclear]

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:27.080
and people used to say to me, Pauline you haven't got a cold and I'd have one by the end of the night sorta thing, you know?

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:34.740
but now I haven't had, just cold, I'd get slightly ill, and then you just get it very mild

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.700
version don't you

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.700
[Waterson?]

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.760
-Well, me, it wasn't so much physical, it was um,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.540
it was more, my marriage was on the rocks and I wa s heading downhill fast

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.460
or meant to I think, and just after recieving kundalini awakening it was a logical step

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.100
that this was the way to change direction.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:03.280
I was actually divorced but then my wife came into sahajayoga, we remaried.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.800
-  He's remarried.
- Well thats different
- Yeah

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.080
because children were in trouble, you see - they had children

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:17.360
It got the marriage back straight, and I could see it was the way to go and through, as Jason was saying, with vibrations

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.600
It was clear there was a right way and a wrong way to approach it, a whole lifestyle

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.900
So you have two children to start with and 
since he's had another two wit h the second marriage and now he's got four children.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.500
- Right!
- And is that how many years apart?

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.500
-12
-12 years difference

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.800
- Jason, what has it done for you?
- It was pretty spectacular, I was a functioning alcoholic,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:49.280
slowly, well not very slowly, ceasing to function, I would say I was pretty neurotic,

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:55.280
I believed that politics was a valid way to approach life for one thing - was a fairly neurotic belief.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.780
Umm, I don't believe it now [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.340
- and
- very hot-tempered he is.
- very hot-tempered - I was hot-tempered, that's true and

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:13.780
almost got rid of it now - touch wood - there's only plastic here to touch - and all told, I gave up alcohol and tobacco

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:21.640
the first day, I gave up politics a few months thereafter - I needed it a little bit of persuading

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.480
and over eleven  years, I suppose about,

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:34.600
5 - 8 % as hot-tempered as I was - I'm still a little bit there but I mean, the transformation, you can ask anybody else if you don't ask me.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.940
I feel that I am now lot more peaceful,

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.820
I'm working lot better. Since I got realization I went to university, I got a degree uh..

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:52.440
had two changes of career now starting to succeed as a writer and broadcaster. My intelligence is working immeasurably better,

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:59.760
I'm emotionally a lot happier. I mean, those are the kind of ordinary human things that are difficult to quantify, probably inside

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:07.800
I know that the improvement is several thousand percent. And I know perfectly well that it couldnt have come about getting realization without

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:13.420
following the teachings of Shree Mataji, without letting Her look after me, through

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.620
just doing what She says, doing what She advises, it's slower that frequently

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:28.320
but nonetheless, despite me being slow in following Shree Mataji's advices, still works which shows that the Kundalini

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:35.460
is tremendously powerful, easily even overcomes the resistance of people with a lot of conditioning, a lot of ego and a lot of bad temper.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:44.320
- So, I mean, for me there is...
- But also how many of your friends in Brighton, I mean, just imagine, they were gone cases absolutely

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:52.460
- drug cocktails.
- hippies and all kinds of people from Brighton came in
- ruined, completely ruined brain
- oh my, absolutely recluses, you can call them, recluses

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:58.180
- Yes
- Paul Winter, just imagine, now he's one of the very rich persons there and

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:05.080
he's doing very well there, he discovered somethings and I mean, you can't believe. And some people were from

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:12.560
Oxford and Cambridge and London School of Economics - very highly educated - all into drugs.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:20.320
It was just a fashion - all into drugs - and they had become like cabbages. I tell you once when they came to Me

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.960
some of them said they couldn't even see Me. They saw some sort of light, this, that and all of them

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.700
- are absolutely alright and doing very well
- [UNCLEAR] good one!
- so many of them.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.280
- and they just
- alcoholics
- they stop alcohol, drugs, smoking, I mean, all these things, the easy things just one minute

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:46.560
[UNCLEAR] inside just drops away [UNCLEAR]

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.100
Real idea is just to do that

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:57.580
[UNCLEAR] this is an enormous growth. I mean, think of all the millions of dollars have been spent on trying to give up smoking

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:04.680
No, there is one Dr. Wells, you see, who was an alcoholic and also drug addiction but not so much as alcoholism

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:13.360
and such a qualified man just wasted and Rustom brought him to Me. Another doctor he's head of the

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:21.460
Psychiatry department in Amaan - he brought him to Me and I looked at him and I said, "Now look at this man

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:29.600
such a educated, such a good person just lost." Out of frustration in his family and this and that he took to drugs.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:35.360
And when he became alright - now today he is in charge of seven hospitals in London.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:41.040
- He is business expert on addiction therapy
- And he's working on that.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:47.080
- And I told him,"What do you do?" He said, "I come home and give them bandhans, that's all." [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.980
He's curing people so everybody has tremendous respect for him

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:59.980
- because you cannot cure people but he works out sahaja yoga.
- It's interesting.Have you had a...?

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:07.980
Well I, was working as a Job Assistant in [UNCLEAR] stress [UNCLEAR]

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:15.280
and I had my realization [UNCLEAR]

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:21.280
and I used to go [UNCLEAR] every night [UNCLEAR]

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:29.980
[UNCLEAR] was very nice I was just there on [UNCLEAR]

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:36.260
- How would you [UNCLEAR]?
- I don't know I'm too [UNCLEAR] what's wrong

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:43.340
- And also you must mention how you love each other - that's very important. But we have people from, say,

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.240
this time we had people from 56 nations for our seminar in India

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:55.880
and the way they love each other, I mean, we never have a problem, never. They love each other, they look after each other.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.960
I mean, like universal brotherhood has been established. To see that I felt so very happy.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.180
We had Russians, we had Bulgarians, Romanians, uh.. we had people from East Germany,

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.820
also from Hungary, Czechoslovakia - all this Western Bloc had also come

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:22.040
plus we had people from all over like Columbia and I mean, all the rest of it and the South

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.620
American group and the North American group - like that fifty-six nations and

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:36.380
- Just an [UNCLEAR]
- Yes. My husband says he works for the United Nations and he said, "I can't think of any, any

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:42.240
organization like this. I cannot think - there's no problem, there's no argument,

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.640
nothing - just enjoying each other."

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:55.040
- Have you had an experience?
- Yes, I can't say I was an extreme of anything

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:02.340
except exquisitely I have just prior to discovering sahaja yoga

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.880
had a prolapse disc which turned out to be a thing of long standing and when I;

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.460
Actually, when Shree Mataji first came to Australia, I was in hospital because

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.340
they [UNCLEAR] and all sorts of things to me and that

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:27.620
I was faced with having to wear a belt around me and a catapult

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:36.340
on my leg and also a thing on my shoe to keep my foot straight and after

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.640
about nine months

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:50.820
I, sort of, followed my doctor to see what my progress is [UNCLEAR] , "You're not going to get very much better."

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:57.140
He said, "You know with [UNCLEAR] we can but this has been going on for 20 years and

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.800
nerves are a lot of damage done, you've lost a lot of nerve function."

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:09.480
And so there I was there with all these things - I had a stick as well and

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:16.240
in the meantime before this meeting with the doctor, I had discovered sahaja yoga

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:23.660
and this healing process, no doubt whatever, this is what was happening.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.800
Uh.. through the practices of sahaja yoga just continued. I was way past the period where

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:38.920
my healing should have cut off. Till now, I haven't got any adverse things. I can walk reasonably well - I cannot run very well.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:46.380
Uh.. I'm not too good at dancing forever [LAUGHTER] Apart from that it's, it's

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:54.760
- it's virtually disappeared.
- Can this be put down to power of positive thinking too much degree?

00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:01.580
- Positive thinking is a mental process. Mental process can only develop your ego

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:09.900
- It cannot help you much because if you think positively - well, according to us we go to the right side
-

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:17.440
and the left side is neglected, which is emotions and such a person can become very dry because you can rationalize anything.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.500
The balance is not there but in sahaja yoga actually,

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:28.540
not that you achieve balance but also complete nourishment from the Divine force.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.440
- You're actually getting an extra energy
- All the time
- [UNCLEAR] all the time
- Yeah.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:43.960
It's not only physical energy; It's physical, mental, emotional and specially spiritual and you are always joyous,

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:51.880
always joyous and very happy person. Children are very happy

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.700
they become very intelligent as well as very compassionate.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:03.620
It's very different world you enter into because it's all within you - you have to just touch that Divinity.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:12.140
Hmm, well. I cannot think anything else to ask You.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.560
[LAUGHTER]
- She's [UNCLEAR] to someone else. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:23.220
- You can't think, that's one of the effects of thoughtlessness.
- Thoughtlessness. It's thoughtlessness - no thought.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:31.380
- Maybe that's no more work left.
- It's very normal. [UNCLEAR -THERE'S NO THOUGHT?] if you want you can think, otherwise you won't.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.920
Otherwise you are bombarded by these thoughts, you don't want to have them; They go on haunting - now you are free.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:46.940
- Now I am free.
- Annh.
- Wait a sec - free to watch. Free to what?

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:54.060
Free to think in every way. You see, once you get your realization, nothing is important

00:38:54.560 --> 00:39:02.160
than your being so that you don't take to any drugs; Become so powerful - nothing can touch you,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.940
nothing can dominate you - no habit - nothing.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:15.360
- So even I'm not going to get the [UNCLEAR]
[SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]
- It's up to you. [LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:23.340
- You've free choice, complete free choice.
- You see, in sahaja yoga it's complete free choice. Animals have no choice;

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:31.460
Human-beings have been given freedom to choose. Now by trial and error method they learn

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:39.840
but still they cannot go very far. But once you get realization, the light shows them that it's wrong and you, they just don't do it.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:47.460
It's a simple - always I give them a analogy of a snake. Supposing, it is darkness and you are holding on to a snake

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:56.020
and somebody tells you, "Oh, there's a snake, snake,"  but you won't give up. You'll say, "No, it's a rope." In the darkness you can't argue

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:02.520
till the snake bites you and then suddenly when you see a little flicker of light, you just drop it yourself.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.220
- So, I don't tell them, "Don't do this, don't do that." It just happens by themselves.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.840
- Right.
- You become your own guide, you become your own guru - I don't have to tell you anything.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:21.180
You see yourself, what is benevolent for you, what is joyous for you, what is good for you.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.680
Everything you see yourself because it's all within yourself.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:34.080
Only like one light which is enlightened, one candle which is enlightened, can enlighten another light - that's all.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:44.000
But there's no uh.. nothing that has been done in such a way that you should feel obliged or nothing of the kind;

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.540
It's just one light which is enlightened gives light to another.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:55.540
- Thank You very much. [UNCLEAR]
- May God bless you!
- Thanks
- May God bless you!

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.460
- Can I take a couple of pictures of You with my beginner's cameras? [UNCLEAR] He's got terrific ones.
- Yes, please do, please do.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:07.520
- Please do. There's already continuous [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:15.360
Straighten out your cameras so that the pictures are a little bit clear [UNCLEAR] and it's just much embarrassing.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.560
-  Can I help?
- Trying to work like My husband.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.960
I'm hopelessly bad, I mean, I've never had a camera all My life.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.600
[UNCLEAR] It is very [UNCLEAR] It does everything automatically so I can't [UNCLEAR] it.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:48.980
- This automatics is what?
- Yeah, automatic everything - thank goodness.
- Just automatic, just like this itself

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.320
-  I know [UNCLEAR - THIS ONE?]
- I'm sorry about that
- I know this one very well - it's very good.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.940
- It's magic!
- Thank you, thank you very much.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.960
- Shree Mataji, would You like some water?
- Thank you. What about the lady - she may like too also.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:26.260
- Would you like, would you have some water?
- Ahhh..
- Please have

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:31.280
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:41.100
- Do you think if we can make it to the terminal tomorrow morning, that'll be very much, I mean

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:48.040
- It depends whether what time do we work-wise
- But only thing it should be announcement must be kept

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.460
- wherever we are having the programs, so if you can give it in writing properly
- Yes, Mother.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:43:01.220
- because it happened sometimes that we didn't give them and there was a confusion.
- Alright

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.920
I'm getting prepared for the recording. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.020
Let him [UNCLEAR]

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:24.240
Oh, I wish Your trip is very successful; Australian trip is very successful.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:29.300
Thank you very much. Successful Australia for you.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.700
Australians really need it very much now - so many problems they have

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:44.000
and I feel very concerned and so many are coming.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:50.440
I don't know - they should be alerted at least.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:56.700
like AIDS and all these things [UNCLEAR]

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:04.200
- They must be awakened
- [UNCLEAR] better try

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:12.060
- Beg your pardon.
- Looks like Yourself have been trying and you get to do that
- I'm trying that [UNCLEAR] on My....

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:19.020
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.640
- [UNCLEAR] very good for you.
- Is it?
- Try, try
- I'll try

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:32.640
- It changes the molecular structure of the water and everything
- Yes you can stay
- Once the attention's been vibrated it

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:40.300
- You see, [UNCLEAR]
- Inner feelings [UNCLEAR]
- Once there was a gentleman called he's quite a fan here [UNCLEAR]
-

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:48.360
and he said, "First You give me realization, then only [UNCLEAR] alright. Then I got some water and vibrated it.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:54.780
I said, "Have it." He said, "Is it wine?" I said, "No, it's water." [LAUGHTER]

00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:03.420
He's such a good sahaja yogi today. Lots of fans are here - Mr. Romanos

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:12.020
That's very special water! I'm sure you [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.260
Awesome [UNCLEAR]

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:25.160
- I'm going to come and see what happens.
- I'll see.
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:33.220
Do you need only for the questions or the other number [UNCLEAR]

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:41.360
There're so many other thing but you can tell her later on. Gradually she'll know the inside and out - you know how miraculous it is the time now.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:50.780
We have not explored this area, is the point - we cannot. This is the knowledge of the roots

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:56.680
- We have the knowledge of the tree and if  we don't have the knowledge of the roots the whole thing is [UNCLEAR - WASTED?]

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:02.920
- There're [UNCLEAR] books written now about Beta waves
- Horrible! They have written all nonsense,

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:10.020
absolutely nonsense, without any authority, without any understanding. It's a, you see,

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:15.760
God is such a subject, Divine is such a subject - any body can write

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:23.860
- Even Hitler can write, even Saddam can write, I mean
- Right - they have.
- They have. You see, how can we

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:29.180
stop them - only thing the way they are punished.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:37.780
- Nice, everyone, thanks to you.
- Thank you.
- Thank You!
- Very nice meeting you. Thank you very much

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.160
- Okay. Have a nice time in Brisbane.
- Thank you, thank you.
