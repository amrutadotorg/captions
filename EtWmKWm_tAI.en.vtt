1987-1219 Devi Puja Talk, Aurangabad, India

00:03.351 --> 00:10.922
I am sorry, I was dealing with some newspaper people, journalists,

00:11.123 --> 00:16.139
and they came very late, whatever it is.

00:16.348 --> 00:25.278
I found them to be very sensible and very understanding.

00:45.140 --> 00:50.299
All of us have come to Aurangabad now,

00:50.500 --> 00:58.099
and it seems this place is full of vibrations.

00:58.300 --> 01:03.619
Maybe here Shalivahana has ruled in this area,

01:03.820 --> 01:10.579
but also there have been many saints

01:10.780 --> 01:18.579
who were born on this side of Maharashtra,

01:18.780 --> 01:25.339
and they perpetuated Dharma.

01:25.540 --> 01:30.545
They always talked about self-realization.

01:30.746 --> 01:34.699
Dharma gives you the balance.

01:34.900 --> 01:44.219
It gives you the establishment into proper behaviour,

01:44.420 --> 01:52.339
proper understanding, proper living,

01:52.540 --> 02:00.179
but it doesn't give you the completion of your journey.

02:00.380 --> 02:06.779
It doesn't give you the satisfaction of reaching the destination.

02:06.980 --> 02:11.939
And your personality is still incomplete.

02:12.140 --> 02:18.699
So, one has to have the experience of the spirit.

02:18.900 --> 02:23.939
As I was discussing with them today,

02:24.140 --> 02:38.939
I told them that those who do
not have the experience of the spirit

02:39.140 --> 02:44.059
are not only incomplete, but are limited people.

02:44.260 --> 02:47.179
So whatever they see, or whatever they know,

02:47.380 --> 02:53.339
or whatever they criticize, is limited.

02:53.540 --> 03:00.019
As in English we say that "hate the sin and not the sinner".

03:00.220 --> 03:05.739
Like many people who find something wrong
with Christianity start blaming Christ.

03:05.940 --> 03:09.259
Christ did not created Christianity, first of all.

03:09.460 --> 03:14.940
He did not create Christianity.
He did not create Christians.

03:15.140 --> 03:18.220
So there is no relationship between the two.

03:18.420 --> 03:25.060
As you know, recently, they have
found out the books written by Thomas,

03:25.300 --> 03:29.979
the disciple of Christ who was coming to India.

03:30.180 --> 03:36.540
On his way he went to Egypt,
and there he wrote these treatise

03:36.780 --> 03:43.219
and had put them in a big earthen vessel,

03:43.420 --> 03:48.299
or perhaps it was a metallic thing,

03:48.500 --> 03:54.739
and it was discovered fourty-two years back.

03:54.940 --> 04:03.339
The people whom he considers to be

04:03.540 --> 04:08.499
authorized Christians, he calls them as Gnostic.

04:08.700 --> 04:14.699
"Gne", "gne" in Sanskrit language means, "to know".

04:14.900 --> 04:17.020
"Gne" means "to know".

04:17.300 --> 04:26.219
And he has written that to know,
and to have the personal experience

04:26.420 --> 04:32.499
is the only way to follow Christ.
Clearly.

04:32.700 --> 04:39.184
Not only that, it's said that
God Allmighty who is so kind,

04:39.385 --> 04:41.860
why will He ask you to suffer?

04:42.060 --> 04:46.979
So it challenges all the Christian principles of suffering.

04:47.180 --> 04:52.420
In the same way, in all religions,
people have diverted from the right path,

04:52.620 --> 04:57.459
and have come to the wrong path,

04:57.660 --> 05:04.780
and are indulging into self-created religions,

05:05.020 --> 05:09.980
which has no relationship with reality, or with the incarnations,

05:10.180 --> 05:14.939
those who started those religions or
who gave the ideas of the religion.

05:15.140 --> 05:20.660
I hope you won't do that to Me,
because you are gnostic people.

05:20.900 --> 05:27.979
You are the ones who know,
who have had self-realization.

05:28.180 --> 05:33.459
Without self-realization you cannot have a complete personality.

05:33.660 --> 05:36.180
But as you see in Sahaja Yoga,

05:36.380 --> 05:40.660
you don't have to go to Himalayas,
to give up your families;

05:40.900 --> 05:47.859
you don't have to be away from
the society to get your realization.

05:48.060 --> 05:52.220
You get your realization in the circumstances where you are born.

05:52.460 --> 05:56.659
In the same society, in the same family-life.

05:56.860 --> 06:00.819
But, you rise higher then them,

06:01.020 --> 06:07.380
and try to pull them out of the mire in which they are existing.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.820
This mire of ignorance has to be crossed,

06:11.020 --> 06:16.967
and some of you have to do it.

06:17.180 --> 06:21.619
And when you realize that,

06:21.820 --> 06:27.339
then you should know that you all have to be very strong people.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.779
You all have to be extremely strong.

06:30.980 --> 06:36.539
If you are not strong enough, how
can you pull out the rest of them?

06:36.740 --> 06:40.099
People who are mediocre

06:40.300 --> 06:48.619
think that gradually they'll be
allright, and that they'll come up.

06:48.820 --> 06:53.419
But I would suggest that you should make all-out-effort

06:53.620 --> 06:57.099
to become strong Sahaja Yogis.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.779
To become strong Sahaja Yogis is not difficult.

07:00.980 --> 07:04.019
Because you have all the powers within yourselves.

07:04.220 --> 07:06.420
You have the Kundalini within yourselves.

07:06.620 --> 07:11.859
And you know the way, how to become a realized soul.

07:12.060 --> 07:18.460
The problems are of you being dragged into your ego

07:18.660 --> 07:20.900
or into your conditioning.

07:21.100 --> 07:27.826
Only two problems,
not more.

07:28.100 --> 07:31.260
Like somebody asked, "How many turns there are in London?"

07:31.500 --> 07:35.619
Only two, left or right.

07:35.820 --> 07:38.260
So either you go to the left or to the right.

07:38.460 --> 07:41.739
All the permutations and combinations of this left and right

07:41.940 --> 07:44.740
starts working and then you get into trouble.

07:44.940 --> 07:47.899
And then you get into problems.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.340
But actually it is a very simple thing.

07:51.580 --> 07:55.939
To get out of your ego should be the simplest

07:56.140 --> 08:05.539
and that is where you try to understand yourself.

08:05.740 --> 08:10.139
You see yourself. How you are reacting.

08:10.340 --> 08:13.860
Where is your attention? What are you doing?

08:14.060 --> 08:18.139
What is your attitude towards Sahaja Yoga?

08:18.340 --> 08:22.739
So many people think that "this is my house,

08:22.940 --> 08:29.460
this is my family, this is my car, this is my horse, this is my dog.

08:29.660 --> 08:33.819
I don't know how far it goes - "my, my, my, my, my".

08:34.020 --> 08:37.939
But nothing is yours.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.260
Yesterday, as Kabira has said it,

08:40.500 --> 08:47.739
that "some cheat", that is the death, "will come
and take away everything that is not yours".

08:47.940 --> 08:54.380
Then "my family" then "my
children" All this is a nonsense,

08:54.580 --> 09:01.019
and so, when you start getting attached to this word "my",

09:01.220 --> 09:10.899
there where you fail completely into
your own understanding of your ego,

09:11.100 --> 09:16.939
you're completely blinded by this ego.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.019
First of all you should say that "nothing is mine".

09:23.220 --> 09:27.700
Kabira has said that when the goat is living

09:27.940 --> 09:34.579
she goes on saying "Mei, mei, mei "
means "I, I, I " in Hindi language.

09:34.780 --> 09:37.139
he made a pun on the word "my".

09:37.340 --> 09:43.339
And when she dies, and her intestines are taken out,

09:43.540 --> 09:51.739
and are made into something that spins the  cotton,

09:51.940 --> 09:58.820
they go on the street, these people,
telling people that they are around,

09:59.060 --> 10:03.900
they go on playing on that string
which is made from the intestines

10:04.101 --> 10:08.466
of these goats,

10:08.667 --> 10:16.179
it says, "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi "
meaning "You are, you are, you are "

10:16.380 --> 10:19.859
So one need not be like a goat,

10:20.060 --> 10:23.580
that till you leave you go on saying "I, I, my, my "

10:23.780 --> 10:26.939
When you die then your intestines have to be taken out

10:27.140 --> 10:36.059
and put on that thing just to
make the sound "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi "

10:36.260 --> 10:42.499
So this sound of "I, I, I " is made
only by egoistical human beings,

10:42.700 --> 10:47.779
but this ego is so much identified with you,

10:47.980 --> 10:55.579
that you think that "I am this ego
and ego is me".

10:55.780 --> 11:03.459
And in that ego you start doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

11:03.660 --> 11:09.660
This ego takes you nowhere,
it takes you nowhere

11:09.860 --> 11:13.980
but into a complete mire of ignorance about yourself.

11:14.180 --> 11:21.340
Ultimately you become stupid, others
can tell you that you are stupid,

11:21.540 --> 11:25.780
or you become idiotic,
or you get a bad name,

11:25.980 --> 11:29.420
and everybody knows that you are doing all wrong things,

11:29.660 --> 11:35.499
but nobody dare tell you, because you
are to be reached with a barge pole.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.140
Such a hot-tempered personality you become,

11:38.340 --> 11:41.700
nobody dare come you and say that this is wrong,

11:41.900 --> 11:46.099
it should not be done, it's stupid, idiotic,

11:46.300 --> 11:52.659
and you, yourself, in that idiocity
and stupidity think no end of yourself.

11:52.860 --> 11:55.659
This is the extreme of your ego.

11:55.860 --> 11:59.619
But it's nice, we have people like Hitler to see.

11:59.820 --> 12:07.300
So if you put Hitler as the ideal egoist
then you will not go on that road.

12:07.500 --> 12:14.539
Because it's a very slippery road
and maybe  one day you land up there.

12:14.740 --> 12:18.239
The second side of ours,
which is a very,

12:18.440 --> 12:25.699
looks very morbid and very mired, is the left side.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.900
The movement on the left side is the emotional side.

12:29.140 --> 12:33.019
You develope habits with the left side.

12:33.220 --> 12:39.619
Now, some people have very dangerous
habits, some have simple habits.

12:39.820 --> 12:43.980
Like I have a bad habit, or a good habit, you may say,

12:44.180 --> 12:46.260
that i must put my right hand under my foot,

12:46.460 --> 12:50.419
because it's all the time working, so I want to controll it.

12:50.620 --> 12:54.500
So, I put it under my head like this, while sleeping

12:54.700 --> 12:58.772
and sometimes under my foot, just to make it little bit stop working,

12:58.973 --> 13:01.980
it works too hard.
Just to give it rest.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.019
So under my pillow I put it and sleep.

13:05.220 --> 13:07.500
But I discovered once, I hurt myself,

13:07.700 --> 13:10.419
that I now cannot put it under my head.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.739
I said, "It's a very funny habbit I have got."

13:13.940 --> 13:19.860
But it's not such a dangerous one. It's
quite good. So I am continuing with it.

13:20.060 --> 13:24.099
But I can get rid of it. It's very simple.

13:24.300 --> 13:29.052
But when I get rid of it
I think the people become overactive

13:29.253 --> 13:32.379
so I put it again, under my pillow.

13:32.580 --> 13:37.659
So as Sahaja Yogis all your habbits should be under your control.

13:37.860 --> 13:44.059
Now the
habits we have formed through drugs,

13:44.260 --> 13:49.180
from drinking, from anything, are very dangerous habbits.

13:49.380 --> 13:56.179
Also, people have their attention being all the time around.

13:56.380 --> 14:01.745
All the time is attention here, there and
there, attracting people, looking after them,

14:01.946 --> 14:06.339
not looking after yourself.

14:06.540 --> 14:11.579
This attention has to be brought under control. Is very important.

14:11.780 --> 14:17.419
That's very simple, that whenever it
happens, you just put down your eyes.

14:17.620 --> 14:20.899
Keep your eyes down.

14:21.100 --> 14:24.625
That's one of the ways we

14:24.826 --> 14:31.699
allow our attentiion to fritter away,
and also our growth becomes stunted.

14:31.900 --> 14:39.099
This is a very very dangerous thing which
in the West specially we have developed.

14:39.300 --> 14:43.779
Here, also, people must read every shop's name.

14:43.980 --> 14:47.100
Indians have a bad habit, because
they have just now started reading,

14:47.300 --> 14:50.220
so they want to read everything that they find, anything.

14:50.420 --> 14:57.180
So on the road if there is a road of
shops, they read every name of every shop,

14:57.420 --> 15:02.579
turn round again and see if they have missed anything.

15:02.780 --> 15:08.979
It sounds stupid. But they all do it.
And all the time they are doing it.

15:09.180 --> 15:15.939
So the attention, wherevever it goes,
has to be under our control.

15:16.140 --> 15:20.259
We have to keep it, all the time under our control.

15:20.460 --> 15:26.620
As Namadeva has said very clearly,
in Guru Grant Sahib has written,

15:26.820 --> 15:34.099
that when a little child is flying the kite,

15:34.300 --> 15:38.460
he's talking  to everyone,
he's playing in a way,

15:38.660 --> 15:43.819
but his attention is on the kite.

15:44.020 --> 15:48.140
And when a housewife is carring her duties,

15:48.340 --> 15:55.259
putting her child on her waiste and working,

15:55.460 --> 16:02.699
then she's doing all kinds of work,
but her attention is on the child.

16:02.900 --> 16:08.580
The Ladies who are carrying three-four
earthen pots on their heads,

16:08.780 --> 16:14.339
water filled up to the brim,

16:14.540 --> 16:19.540
are walking, talking to each other,
having mirth and enjoyment,

16:19.780 --> 16:25.099
but the attention is on the earthen pot, on their heads.

16:25.300 --> 16:28.659
In the same way, whatever adventure you are into,

16:28.860 --> 16:33.739
whatever you are doing, your attention should be on your spirit.

16:33.940 --> 16:38.579
Then everything is under control,
and you can never get enveloped

16:38.780 --> 16:45.115
into anything where attention should not be lost.

16:45.316 --> 16:47.459
So, these two problems we have,

16:47.660 --> 16:51.819
and those problems even after realization people have it.

16:52.020 --> 16:56.019
So please try, when you are not meditating,

16:56.220 --> 17:00.739
to keep your attention on your spirit.

17:00.940 --> 17:07.019
Now, the person who is left-sided or right-sided,

17:07.220 --> 17:12.339
he has developed a mechanism within himself to justify himself.

17:12.540 --> 17:16.140
Through his intellect, or maybe if
they are ladies they have water power,

17:16.340 --> 17:20.499
they'll start crying. And you just
don't know what to say to them.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.492
If you tell them anything, first thing they'll do is to cry,

17:23.693 --> 17:27.739
means sometimes I feel there are thousand arrows on My head

17:27.940 --> 17:31.540
when they start crying. It is
impossible to say anything to them.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.980
And if you talk to some men
the'lll give so many explanations

17:35.180 --> 17:40.379
that you would feel like, just, going off to sleep.

17:40.580 --> 17:44.460
It's so boring. It''s easy to read
some book like "War and Peace"

17:44.660 --> 17:51.507
than to listen to the arguments of such people.

17:51.991 --> 17:57.860
But they don't want to see that
this is all ego, which is talking,

17:58.060 --> 18:01.830
It is not, they are talking,
it is not their spirit.

18:02.031 --> 18:04.180
And if the spirit has to evolve

18:04.380 --> 18:11.219
we have to be extremely wittnessing, in a full way,

18:11.420 --> 18:13.500
very alert, extremely alert

18:13.700 --> 18:16.349
and wittnessing ourselves, what are we doing.

18:16.550 --> 18:22.899
Then only we reach the completion of our realization.

18:23.100 --> 18:27.619
Unless and until you reach the completion of your realization,

18:27.820 --> 18:34.499
you can never be masters of your attention,

18:34.700 --> 18:40.779
and you can never be the enjoyer of your joy,

18:40.980 --> 18:44.459
and you can never know the truth fully.

18:44.660 --> 18:50.019
Achieve this Sat-Chit-Ananda swarupa

18:50.220 --> 18:54.024
you have to be extremely careful about

18:54.225 --> 19:04.219
the instrument that God has given
you, this body, mind and emotions.

19:04.420 --> 19:09.140
You have to keep them in check,
because wherever your habits are

19:09.340 --> 19:12.899
they can never be joy giving, it's a joyless pursuit.

19:13.100 --> 19:19.339
and wherever your ego is, it's a destructive effort.

19:19.540 --> 19:22.460
So both things are detrimental to your growth,

19:22.700 --> 19:28.619
apart from that, they are extremely dangerous thing for yogis.

19:28.820 --> 19:31.860
So, as you are, in whatever conditions you are,

19:32.060 --> 19:41.379
in whatever situations you are,
whatever may be the surroundings,

19:41.580 --> 19:50.859
like a dirty mire full of creatures and filth,

19:51.060 --> 19:54.539
you can become like lotuses.

19:54.740 --> 19:57.379
When you become like lotuses

19:57.568 --> 20:03.202
All that is filth, all that is horrible can become fragrant,

20:03.403 --> 20:05.553
And this is what we have to achieve.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.859
When people will see the lotuses they'll come to you,

20:10.060 --> 20:17.539
not to see the worms and to see
the filth, but to see the lotuses.

20:17.740 --> 20:21.380
So please, this time, correct yourself,

20:21.580 --> 20:25.820
you don't need anybody to correct
you, you just correct yourself,

20:26.020 --> 20:29.020
watch out for yourself, and see for yourself.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.959
If something doesn't work out just give up.

20:32.160 --> 20:36.859
Don't go to extrems for anything.

20:37.060 --> 20:41.340
Must learn to give up at a point
and be happy about it.

20:41.540 --> 20:45.740
If you are contained within yourself,
if your hand is attached to your body,

20:45.940 --> 20:49.989
then you reach up to a point and then leave it, but if it is not attached,

20:50.190 --> 20:54.020
if it is disintegrated then it goes
all round and round and round

20:54.220 --> 20:57.699
and comes back without anything.

20:57.900 --> 21:01.620
That understanding has to be there in you people

21:01.820 --> 21:04.699
because you're standing in the central path,

21:04.900 --> 21:07.667
and you're attached to the central path, not only,

21:07.868 --> 21:09.940
but you are identified with it.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.060
So you cannot go too far to the left,

21:12.260 --> 21:16.180
cannot go too far to the right,
if you do that you get lost.

21:16.380 --> 21:19.020
Then you are no more a Sahaja Yogi,

21:19.260 --> 21:23.260
and then no use having you here artificially or superficially

21:23.460 --> 21:28.979
because it will be hypocrisy.

21:29.180 --> 21:34.157
Whatever is needed to put you back into right frame

21:34.358 --> 21:37.419
you must accept.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.545
And whatever is needed to understand Sahaja Yoga

21:40.746 --> 21:44.659
you have to do. As I have said, please try to learn English language.

21:44.860 --> 21:49.300
I cannot learn fourteen languages.
Very difficult.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.459
It's surprising how I have learned this English language also.

21:53.660 --> 21:58.699
So now to learn fourteen languages
I've to take fourteen Avataras again.

21:58.900 --> 22:03.779
I don't ask you to learn Marathi. Because
that's the best language for Me to speak.

22:03.980 --> 22:06.060
But at least try to learn Engllish.

22:06.260 --> 22:11.874
and then we can see if you can learn Marathi or Hindi.

22:12.075 --> 22:14.550
What is to say now?

22:14.751 --> 22:20.305
that you are born in auspicious place.
this auspicious place Aurangabad,

22:20.506 --> 22:26.105
I feel that ,s very auspicious place.
Great Saints are born here.

22:26.306 --> 22:32.864
Since thousand of years people worked
and gave you these Punyas.

22:33.065 --> 22:36.905
Because of those Punyas you are here today

22:37.106 --> 22:40.395
You behaved well,
respected Dharmas

22:40.596 --> 22:42.777
but not yet reached the Completeness.

22:42.978 --> 22:47.269
Therefore you took Self Realisation.
After getting Self Realisation

22:47.470 --> 22:49.738
we should be able to see our defects.

22:49.939 --> 22:52.103
Otherwise you have not got that light yet.

22:52.304 --> 22:56.065
Now with the Foreigners
they have other defects.

22:56.266 --> 22:58.705
and Indian people have another defects.

22:58.906 --> 23:01.065
And now I see those defects so prominantly

23:01.266 --> 23:04.745
that I feel sometimes better I tell them very clearly.

23:04.946 --> 23:08.986
Actually
for Indians my house

23:09.186 --> 23:16.803
my daughter, my grandson these things
very much and they are so much involved

23:17.026 --> 23:21.530
in the family matters that
they can not come out of it.

23:21.731 --> 23:26.793
I made 4-5 boys marriages and
sent them to Austria.

23:26.994 --> 23:30.226
They had no jobs.
They got nice jobs there.

23:30.427 --> 23:32.827
Immediately they made their own houses

23:33.028 --> 23:36.185
or rather an Indian man can not live without home.

23:36.386 --> 23:39.431
Even having all the facilities in the Ashram they want their separate houses.

23:39.632 --> 23:41.691
Their wives get bored

23:41.892 --> 23:44.146
because to have separate house means to work on your own.

23:44.346 --> 23:49.985
There are no servants, no nothing. After
having Delivery also they work on their own.

23:50.186 --> 23:52.820
Though they are pregnant they have to work on their own.

23:53.021 --> 23:57.864
Husbands will be enjoying outside.
They will have Cars, have Television

23:58.065 --> 24:02.025
and then go everywhere.
After coming home

24:02.226 --> 24:07.905
shout at wives, ‘You did
not cook well, did not do that’.

24:08.106 --> 24:10.625
Wives got bored. What kind of husbands are this?

24:10.826 --> 24:14.170
They can not work everything,
can not clean outside.

24:14.371 --> 24:18.367
Only my house should be neat
and clean and go out for scrolling.

24:18.568 --> 24:23.866
Everyone is the same here. Here
Indian men can not work anything.

24:24.066 --> 24:27.985
They do not use their hands for Work.
All are sophisticated.

24:28.186 --> 24:33.779
We have appointed a Gardner.
Well, he is Gardner. From Austria.

24:33.980 --> 24:38.305
He is also an agriculture
adviser of U.N. He came here.

24:38.506 --> 24:40.946
He takes Spade and Scraper
in hands  and works so hard.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.105
Indian men with hands on Waist
and wearing Gumboots.

24:44.306 --> 24:46.545
I asked," why did you wear Gumboots?"

24:46.746 --> 24:53.145
I have Problems with mud. Is it so?
Then you can go now and be royal.

24:53.346 --> 24:58.426
These things are very much in us.
And speciality of Wives is that

24:58.627 --> 25:02.065
they know well that our husbands
are in our control if the house

25:02.386 --> 25:05.865
is clean and if they get delicious
food. So today this delicious Dish,

25:06.065 --> 25:08.946
tomorrow another delicious Dish
for husband.

25:09.146 --> 25:11.786
Then for the meal they
give you what you like.

25:11.986 --> 25:14.026
So if you like bitter Gourds
then bring the bitter Gourd

25:14.226 --> 25:16.866
at any cost from the Market.
Then cook them for husband.

25:17.066 --> 25:20.466
All the time serve husband.
Whole time after husband.

25:20.667 --> 25:23.094
First thing, due to this husbands get spoiled.

25:23.295 --> 25:26.760
And. Home is something
special, is our thinking,

25:26.961 --> 25:31.546
Our attention does not go
beyond that. That is my, mine.

25:31.747 --> 25:38.614
It becomes so narrow minded
that we get destroyed in this.

25:39.065 --> 25:42.746
This should go away from us If
you are Sahajyogis, became Yogis

25:42.986 --> 25:51.327
wherever they sit, it is your home,
wherever you go it is your home.

25:51.932 --> 25:56.945
do not ask, the family is small. How
that smallness will become gross?

25:57.146 --> 26:00.305
You are born in Yogabhumi of India
because of whatever Punyas

26:00.506 --> 26:06.345
you earned in past Births.
But everything gets destroyed.

26:06.546 --> 26:09.611
That greatness should come.
That greatness does not come and

26:09.812 --> 26:12.345
Some people even say
it is very less in Men.

26:12.546 --> 26:15.345
Now, Now all have written that

26:15.546 --> 26:18.265
we like Indian women but not Indian Men.

26:18.466 --> 26:22.399
Because all are lazy Lumps,
we can see it.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.786
If there is dirt outside the house
they will still walk on it.

26:25.986 --> 26:30.225
But women will keep the house clean.
But women are clever.

26:30.426 --> 26:32.705
If the house is in order then
husband stays at home.

26:32.906 --> 26:38.145
It is very difficult to keep him at
home because he always remains out.

26:38.346 --> 26:44.985
Therefore we have the defect that
we do not have collectiveness in us.

26:45.186 --> 26:49.905
How to become collective,
how to be nice with one another,

26:50.106 --> 26:53.615
how to become compassionate
we do not think this.

26:53.816 --> 26:56.864
Now with the great difficulties
we opened an Ashram in Delhi.

26:57.065 --> 27:00.026
Nobody wants to stay there. Somehow
we sent one couple from Mumbai.

27:00.226 --> 27:04.025
Within 2 days returned back.

27:04.226 --> 27:11.345
The feeling like
my home should be given up.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.586
The day when you will say that
the whole world is my home

27:14.787 --> 27:19.865
then can be said that you have become
great. The mind is so restricted.

27:20.066 --> 27:22.484
How Sahajayogis will do progress.

27:22.685 --> 27:26.865
Though they become Sahajayogis, even they
meditate, do Pujas, everything is OK.

27:27.066 --> 27:29.587
It is past earnings.

27:29.788 --> 27:34.450
But as it is.
No progress  beyond that.

27:34.651 --> 27:38.603
I have found reason for that
is wasting time at home very much.

27:38.804 --> 27:42.436
If you move only in Circle
how will you go further?

27:42.637 --> 27:46.945
We can not get in Collectivity.
So much Selfcentreness.

27:47.146 --> 27:51.746
Increase only Self Esteem.
My home, my wife, my children

27:51.947 --> 27:54.025
this and that.

27:54.226 --> 28:02.707
Until you do not come out of this it is
only load of work. It is just a Donkey-work.

28:02.908 --> 28:07.265
If God is doing everything
then why do you become Donkey?

28:07.466 --> 28:12.705
If you say you do everything
then you became donkey

28:12.906 --> 28:19.065
Like Jesus was sitting on a Donkey
and Donkey was carrying him.

28:19.266 --> 28:22.865
That Donkey thought,
it became Jesus because

28:23.065 --> 28:25.747
everyone was garlanding donkey.

28:25.948 --> 28:30.065
Then Donkey started troubling Jesus. So Jesus
got down of donkey and went somewhere else.

28:30.266 --> 28:34.864
From other side came the Washerman, the master
of donkey. He beated (slapped) donkey nicely.

28:35.065 --> 28:41.499
Then it realised that it itself
is donkey and Jesus is Jesus.

28:41.700 --> 28:45.380
Likewise Yogi is Yogi.
He is not donkey.

28:45.581 --> 28:48.715
Unnecessary donkey-work.
To please wife,

28:48.916 --> 28:53.501
please this person, please that person. There is no need.

28:53.702 --> 28:56.956
In collectivity One should get in collectivity. To get in collectivity

28:57.157 --> 29:00.864
first of all one should give up
all these small small petty things.

29:01.065 --> 29:05.254
Small person sees everything small. Does not see anything gross.

29:05.455 --> 29:09.105
Whatever is small, which is false is always easily accepted.

29:09.306 --> 29:11.808
Therefore we have to make our mind great.

29:12.009 --> 29:14.145
First of all my house these Words should be given up.

29:14.346 --> 29:20.469
Mine, this word is false. What is there in
mine? Like yesterday it was said about Kabira

29:20.670 --> 29:25.065
that one theif came and
robbed me. Means who? Death.

29:25.266 --> 29:27.864
The time when Death comes
everything remains behind.

29:28.065 --> 29:31.186
Then my, mine everything is left
behind. But this Death has come in us

29:31.386 --> 29:34.906
because we have become Sahajayogis
now. Formerly we were Eggs

29:35.106 --> 29:36.466
and now
we have become Birds.

29:36.666 --> 29:38.864
So everything from the past
has been left behind.

29:39.065 --> 29:41.906
Now we have to spread
our Wings and take flights.

29:42.146 --> 29:45.305
But we are still
entangled in our Wings.

29:45.506 --> 29:50.864
What to say now? We are still stuck
up in mud. Which is not correct.

29:51.065 --> 29:56.025
But after this everyone should make his
mind great. Greatness should be adopted.

29:56.226 --> 30:01.185
And this acceptance of greatness
should be enjoyed by everyone.

30:01.386 --> 30:04.791
So many people come here. You
do not speak with them, meet them.

30:04.992 --> 30:08.309
Do not do any introduction with anyone. That is wrong. When these people come

30:08.510 --> 30:11.301
many of you
help them, serve them, agreed.

30:11.502 --> 30:14.025
But you should introduce yourself
with them. Make freindship with them

30:14.226 --> 30:18.866
because they are your brothers and you
do not have any brothers or any sisters.

30:19.066 --> 30:23.822
These are your relatives. It is said that
they are your own near and dear ones.

30:24.023 --> 30:28.025
Gyaneshwara has said clearly that
these are your own Kith and Kin.

30:28.226 --> 30:31.986
these are your own Kith and Kin.
All others are not your relatives.

30:32.186 --> 30:36.825
There is no comparison between you and them.
They say something and do something else.

30:37.026 --> 30:40.996
I can say about my family that some
are in Sahajayoga, they are there.

30:41.197 --> 30:44.265
Those who are not Yogis I do
not know them. They are Strangers.

30:44.466 --> 30:49.065
So those people who are not in Sahajayoga
are not relatives, accept this.

30:49.266 --> 30:52.571
You will be surprised.
Many things will be given up.

30:52.772 --> 30:55.186
Now there is Maratha.
Then Maratha should

30:55.386 --> 30:57.784
marry Maratha. Then it is
OK if he is beating his Wife.

30:57.985 --> 31:01.479
It is OK even if he is not Sahajayogi.
It is OK however way he is treating her.

31:01.680 --> 31:06.365
But Maratha should marry Maratha.
Why?

31:06.566 --> 31:12.825
Tommorrow if that girl is in trouble
then will your Maratha stand by her?

31:13.026 --> 31:15.105
But Sahajayogi will stand by her.

31:15.306 --> 31:21.225
Sahajayogi should marry Sahajayogi
and there if something goes wrong then

31:21.426 --> 31:26.745
Mother we married in Sahajayoga
therfore we got in trouble.

31:26.946 --> 31:33.506
This Cast system or internal hatred
about religion or about another Caste

31:33.707 --> 31:38.136
or for another Country that will
be disappeared only after marrying.

31:38.337 --> 31:41.905
I do not see any other solution.
We can understand by seeing it.

31:42.106 --> 31:45.524
Just few days ago I made one
Maratha girl’s marriage in Australia.

31:45.725 --> 31:49.305
Her family members
made a big issue

31:49.506 --> 31:53.305
and said that they will go to the
Police. I said," Go. Do as you like."

31:53.506 --> 31:56.250
She is an adult now.
She has all the rights.

31:56.451 --> 31:58.906
They did (tried) a lot
but nothing could work out.

31:59.106 --> 32:02.906
Now that girl is very wise
and got married so nicely.

32:03.106 --> 32:05.986
Her husband has a good Salary, etc.
They see this.

32:06.186 --> 32:11.345
Now all of them want to go
to Australia with packings.

32:11.546 --> 32:14.666
At the time of marriage they did stupidity.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.905
Likewise we are Bramhins and marry only with Bramhins

32:18.106 --> 32:21.545
and if tommorrow that Bramhin threw
out of the house, what will you do?

32:21.746 --> 32:25.146
Then you will come to me. Mataji, please
do something about our Son-in-law.

32:25.346 --> 32:27.986
What should I do? You yourself found
such a Bramhin Son-in-law.

32:28.186 --> 32:32.145
Then have it !
Why should I do for that?

32:32.346 --> 32:36.864
Like this many big big
things we are wasting blindly

32:37.065 --> 32:41.864
and all these problems
stood in front of us

32:42.065 --> 32:45.465
because we did not raise our Aim. We are Yogis.

32:45.666 --> 32:48.864
From inside we have become Ascetics Though
from outside we are free from worldly matters,

32:49.065 --> 32:51.865
we have become Ascetics.
You should be proud that

32:52.065 --> 32:55.746
you have become Ascetics
and you should be happy about it.

32:55.947 --> 32:59.065
Otherwise you will not progress,
will never progress.

32:59.346 --> 33:01.643
Whatever you do you will not progress

33:01.844 --> 33:04.435
until you make your mind great.

33:04.636 --> 33:09.945
And we have many misunderstandings
in us those should go away.

33:10.146 --> 33:12.547
No one will be called
as real Yogi

33:12.748 --> 33:15.420
unless all these false ideas go away.

33:15.621 --> 33:20.266
So no one should keep these all kinds
of strange, peculiar things in them.

33:20.506 --> 33:22.700
You will be surprised about what I say.

33:22.901 --> 33:27.945
Before this in this Maharashtra
whichever many great Saints,

33:28.146 --> 33:32.345
Sages took birth.
Very great Saints.

33:32.546 --> 33:37.603
Those Saints and Sages have
told the same thing that Cast system,

33:37.804 --> 33:40.265
Religion-fanticism are very bad things.

33:40.466 --> 33:44.145
Take any Stone and Take any Stone
and put Shendur or Kumkum on it.

33:44.346 --> 33:47.906
It is said that Nrusimha Saraswati
(Freedom fighter) used to spit on it.

33:48.106 --> 33:52.225
If he saw something like that used to spit on it.

33:52.426 --> 33:54.451
He raised his Weapons against them many a times.

33:54.652 --> 33:57.945
But he was alone
and so people troubled him.

33:58.146 --> 34:03.437
Dnyaneswara also suffered a lot. He was
tortured because he was Sanyasi’s son.

34:03.638 --> 34:11.105
Though he was son of Sanyasi,
he was higher than all the Bramhins.

34:11.306 --> 34:13.345
In such a way
many things has happened

34:13.546 --> 34:16.683
happened in our Country. So we should
learn from that history

34:16.884 --> 34:19.660
and now we have become Yogis.
Therefore in such situations

34:19.861 --> 34:25.027
we should behave ourselves so that we
are standing on our Basic Principles.

34:25.228 --> 34:28.688
We have achieved everything. So we
do not belong to those things.

34:28.889 --> 34:32.864
We are only Yogis and these
things do not suit to Yogis.

34:33.065 --> 34:36.523
In such way all the false ideas

34:36.724 --> 34:40.989
or whatever way you had them till today
should be given up

34:41.190 --> 34:46.185
and we should place God in our hearts.

34:46.386 --> 34:49.825
Without being obstinate
all those things should be given up.

34:50.026 --> 34:52.864
Give up completely.
Chokha Mela was also a Saint.

34:53.065 --> 34:56.849
And likewise
Ramdas Swami was also a Saint.

34:57.050 --> 35:00.343
But followers of Ramdas Swami and followers of Chokha Mela

35:00.544 --> 35:03.865
are fighting with each other.
It is a amazing.

35:04.066 --> 35:08.545
If both are Saints why should there be
any fight between them. But it will be.

35:08.746 --> 35:12.535
Because there is no vision
so these things happen.

35:12.736 --> 35:15.265
Therefore
I want to tell you that

35:15.466 --> 35:18.065
We have to come out of this Cast system and stupidity.

35:18.266 --> 35:21.985
In Muslims, in Christianity
it is same thing everywhere.

35:22.186 --> 35:25.969
Though following these Religions
tell me one thing that

35:26.170 --> 35:30.105
have you anywhere seen that man can
not do any Sin because of any Religion?

35:30.306 --> 35:35.001
Ready for all kinds of Sins. Though
he is Muslim, Hindu or Christian.

35:35.202 --> 35:40.305
I have not seen any one
who will not commit any Sin.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.674
But Yogis can not do any Sin.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.499
If they do then Vibrations will go from hands.

35:45.700 --> 35:49.625
Saints never did Sins.
No one had to tell them.

35:49.826 --> 35:52.906
Automatically they became like that.
We should become like that

35:53.106 --> 35:57.426
and achieve
that Stability forever.

35:57.627 --> 36:00.266
Sahajayoga is
a gate of Salvage (Moksha).

36:00.466 --> 36:04.145
So you should feel great
that you came to Sahajayoga.

36:04.346 --> 36:12.025
You should respect yourself and
you should grow in that respect.

36:12.226 --> 36:15.305
Actually we do not have to
sacrifice anything in Sahajayoga.

36:15.506 --> 36:18.345
Yes, but if you give up your Wisdom
then we can not do anything.

36:18.546 --> 36:21.610
But we do not need people who are great Sacrificers.

36:21.811 --> 36:25.946
On the contrary there are only
benefits. Everyone gets benefited

36:26.186 --> 36:30.864
but there is also an illusion.
One should not get lost in that

36:31.065 --> 36:35.065
There are many benefits. You will get
Laxmi’s blessing, shall get good health.

36:35.266 --> 36:39.425
May get various benefits. But it is
an illusion. Beyond that is Spirit.

36:39.626 --> 36:43.746
That we should achieve
and should be dwelling in it.

36:43.947 --> 36:49.865
This I am telling you very clearly and
everyone should give up all the things

36:50.065 --> 36:53.059
of Religions and Religions fanaticism. Likewise

36:53.260 --> 36:57.722
Atheists also should open their Eyes
and see if there God exists or not.

36:57.923 --> 37:01.345
They do not have any authority
to deny God, existence of God.

37:01.546 --> 37:05.970
Who are they to say such things? And
if they say so then they are wrong

37:06.171 --> 37:11.484
because they have not yet seen if God
exists or not. So there should be Purity.

37:11.685 --> 37:19.025
One should make oneself absolute pure.
And in that Purity we should understand

37:19.226 --> 37:23.145
know God. Otherwise
it won’t be understood.

37:23.346 --> 37:26.465
There won’t be oneness, unity
and any benefits ever.

37:26.666 --> 37:29.375
Unnecessarily
we should not come here as we travel

37:29.575 --> 37:32.564
to do pilgrimage to Pandhari.
I request you all that

37:32.764 --> 37:36.345
you should achieve something.
A very sincere request.

37:36.546 --> 37:39.687
I see that here in Maharashtra
apart from lot of hardwork

37:39.887 --> 37:41.863
why Sahajayoga has not deeply established.

37:42.064 --> 37:46.011
Because only by doing my Puja
nothing will happen. What is the use?

37:46.212 --> 37:48.625
You are anyway doing my puja in all Temples.

37:48.826 --> 37:53.225
To do only Puja is useless here. Today
it should be decided and determined

37:53.426 --> 37:58.295
that we are doing Shri Mataji’s puja
keeping all this fanaticism away.

37:58.496 --> 38:01.185
We are doing Shri Mataji’s puja keeping ourself clean.

38:01.386 --> 38:05.530
Then only there will be benefit.
Otherwise I am suffering from Puja.

38:05.731 --> 38:09.390
This is a big authority. And
though I have given you,

38:09.590 --> 38:12.145
you should acquire
that deservence.

38:12.346 --> 38:15.625
And I bless you all !
Many blessings !

38:15.826 --> 38:18.906
Please attention to yourself.
Know your importance !

38:19.106 --> 38:22.106
Know your greatness !
Today which Task you have taken.

38:22.506 --> 38:24.986
I have started this great Work
of Evolution of Universe.

38:25.186 --> 38:28.586
You are standing there
and you should be prepared for that.

38:28.786 --> 38:32.421
Everyone should be strong and ready.
Today is the first Day.

38:32.621 --> 38:37.065
Therefore I say explicitly that
you are

38:37.266 --> 38:40.556
organising whatever to be
done. But I am not doing it

38:40.756 --> 38:44.604
Mother is doing if you think this way
and then

38:44.804 --> 38:47.106
then whatever we are doing
in that

38:47.306 --> 38:50.546
let only Divine Work be manifested
if you desire this

38:50.746 --> 38:53.786
then everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

38:53.987 --> 38:59.460
Anyway, I bless you all.
May God bless you all!
