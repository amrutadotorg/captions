00:04.490 --> 00:12.470
Yesterday
you have seen how Durga used to protect all

00:12.540 --> 00:28.047
the seekers, sadhakas, and how She killed
the people who have been troubling, torturing,

00:28.150 --> 00:33.017
killing the seekers of truth.

00:33.319 --> 00:41.088
Her whole advent was to protect them from
all these evil forces.

00:42.938 --> 00:48.869
In those days, that was the most important
work.

00:48.939 --> 01:00.279
So that's how the sadhakas came up to these
modern times, and now they are seekers of

01:00.279 --> 01:06.810
truth or they have found the truth.

01:06.810 --> 01:25.740
All this different passage has taught the
sadhakas what is the use of their life.

01:25.740 --> 01:36.169
They were frantically, first, trying to find
the truth, frantically, and they went into

01:36.169 --> 01:38.190
different difficult places.

01:38.190 --> 01:52.630
They thought by going into some lonely places
they'll be able to settle their mind in peace

01:52.630 --> 01:55.710
and they'll be able to find the truth.

01:55.710 --> 02:06.360
Also they sacrificed many things: their wealth,
which was bothering them; their families,

02:06.360 --> 02:09.890
they thought was standing in the way of their
search.

02:09.890 --> 02:23.059
All this
went on and there are still some people who

02:23.059 --> 02:30.610
believe that by becoming an ascetic one can
find the truth.

02:30.610 --> 02:33.789
Buddha did the same.

02:33.789 --> 02:37.110
Mahavira did the same.

02:37.110 --> 02:41.830
Their life was nothing but a great tapasya.

02:41.830 --> 02:55.899
Their tapasyas are helping us today in such
a way that we now have got such a blessing

02:55.899 --> 03:06.959
that our personalities, as they are, can receive
Self Realization for which people struggled

03:06.959 --> 03:21.630
and struggled in such a way that if you read
that, how they were suffering, you might be

03:21.630 --> 03:32.220
really amazed how they went through all this
suffering and all this tapasya, just with

03:32.220 --> 03:39.860
the goal to get their Self Realization.

03:39.860 --> 03:48.420
It is an ordeal even to read about them and
to know about them.

03:48.420 --> 03:55.800
And while they were seeking, also, there were
so many people who tried to trouble them,

03:55.800 --> 04:01.280
who tried to torture them, who tried to kill.

04:01.280 --> 04:10.199
And the people surrounding them didn't know
what they were doing.

04:10.199 --> 04:15.260
They used to ridicule them, laugh at them,
make fun of them.

04:15.260 --> 04:26.400
With all this, what we learn that we have
got our Self Realization very easily, without

04:26.400 --> 04:32.700
any torture, without any ordeal, without any
sufferings, fasting, nothing.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.650
It's not true.

04:34.650 --> 04:45.510
Because you are the same people who have done
all this before and that's why you are here.

04:45.510 --> 04:49.150
It's your matter of right to have your Self
Realization.

04:49.150 --> 04:55.930
It's no way is to say that “without anything
we got it”.

04:55.930 --> 05:00.270
Because it is life after life you have been
seekers.

05:00.270 --> 05:06.610
Whatever path you followed, whatever religion
you followed, whatever faiths you followed,

05:06.610 --> 05:09.050
it was a torture for you.

05:09.050 --> 05:16.580
And this torture is today now fulfilled, that
today you are self-realized people.

05:16.580 --> 05:25.500
But in any way we see that human beings, if
they get something rather easily they don't

05:25.500 --> 05:29.640
understand the value of how they got it.

05:29.640 --> 05:42.380
Now to get this easily, actually you must
know, is not just because you were nothing.

05:42.380 --> 05:45.480
You were something great.

05:45.480 --> 05:54.490
You were great saints went into Himalayas,
you did all kinds of ordeals and fasting and

05:54.490 --> 06:01.920
where so many of you were killed and butchered
in the name of God.

06:01.920 --> 06:11.360
So today, whatever you have got, whatever
Realization you have got, is not just something

06:11.360 --> 06:18.260
you should think that "It's only Mother's
grace that we have got it."

06:18.260 --> 06:27.460
It's your own great personality which has
achieved it.

06:27.460 --> 06:33.350
Otherwise, it would have been impossible for
Me to give you Realization.

06:33.350 --> 06:40.570
Whatever the work the deities have done, they
have brought you to this level of human existence,

06:40.570 --> 06:44.410
protecting you.

06:44.410 --> 06:53.380
But now, naturally, just this is the last
step which you have crossed and you have achieved

06:53.380 --> 07:05.140
this Self Realization and so many of you have
achieved great heights.

07:05.140 --> 07:14.060
This power within us, the Kundalini, which
has connected you to this all-pervading

07:14.060 --> 07:29.230
Power, has been struggling, has been guiding
you, has been all the time looking after you,

07:29.230 --> 07:35.860
protecting you so that you should achieve
your goal in this Kali Yuga.

07:35.860 --> 07:41.790
It was said that only during Kali Yuga this
will happen and those people who are seeking

07:41.790 --> 07:51.510
God in the mountains and in the valleys will
find it, but they'll be normal people, people

07:51.510 --> 08:00.910
who will have household and living like normal
people in the society.

08:00.910 --> 08:08.720
They won't be some sort of sadhus or saints,
but people who are married, who have children,

08:08.720 --> 08:14.410
all such people who are leading a very normal
life will receive their Realization.

08:14.410 --> 08:19.930
It’s already said, it’s already predicted
by Bhrugu Muni.

08:19.930 --> 08:24.899
So it's all been already said, I think all
been planned.

08:24.899 --> 08:32.240
But in this a credit goes, of course, to you
people, that you have recognized what is the

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
truth.

08:33.240 --> 08:37.019
As you know, there are so many false people
going about.

08:37.019 --> 08:45.220
They are doing all kinds of tricks, they are
trying all kinds of methods to entice people.

08:45.220 --> 08:49.360
Despite that, you have recognized Me.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.489
This recognition is something very remarkable.

08:52.489 --> 09:01.280
And I am Myself surprised how, like lost children
finding their mother, come back to her, in

09:01.280 --> 09:04.650
the same way all of you are here.

09:04.650 --> 09:12.570
But in this we should not think that we have
got it easily, or we have got it without any

09:12.570 --> 09:20.480
difficulties, because this can create a little
problem that we will not go further with the

09:20.480 --> 09:26.689
same speed, with the same dedication as we
have been doing before.

09:26.689 --> 09:30.629
So whatever you think is easy, was not easy
at all.

09:30.629 --> 09:31.639
It is sahaja.

09:31.639 --> 09:34.999
It is, one can say, spontaneous.

09:34.999 --> 09:43.400
But, now it is for you really to understand
that this time is so important, we have to

09:43.400 --> 09:50.189
save the whole world, that you have to project
yourself, as I said last time, and to find

09:50.189 --> 09:55.769
out ways and methods how you can do these
things.

09:55.769 --> 10:02.189
In Russia, I must tell you, I had a very good
experience of a very highly developed soul

10:02.189 --> 10:04.079
who is a very well known scientist.

10:04.079 --> 10:10.900
He’s one of the biggest scientists of Russia,
and he’s indulging also into spirituality.

10:10.900 --> 10:16.199
He told people that “I’m indulging into
spirituality, I would like to see Mother.”

10:16.199 --> 10:19.429
I said, “All right, I would love to see
him.”

10:19.429 --> 10:28.310
So when he came, he looked at Me and he said,
“I know Mother, that You are the incarnation

10:28.310 --> 10:32.009
of God in these modern times.”

10:32.009 --> 10:35.509
I was quite surprised for a scientist to say
that.

10:35.509 --> 10:43.090
But his eyes, so pure and so full of devotion
and humility.

10:43.090 --> 10:49.670
Then he says that “I want to do something
if You help me.”

10:49.670 --> 10:52.340
I said, “What do you want to do?”

10:52.340 --> 10:58.079
He said, “I cannot measure Your power, I
cannot.”

10:58.079 --> 11:01.439
He had an instrument by which he could measure
the power.

11:01.439 --> 11:05.840
“I can’t also measure the power of Your
photographs.”

11:05.840 --> 11:10.560
He said, he told Me a number which I couldn’t
understand, was something – seven hundred

11:10.560 --> 11:14.290
raised to power, some sort of a billion into
billiardi, like that.

11:14.290 --> 11:16.650
I said, “Now what’s this number is?

11:16.650 --> 11:17.660
I don’t know.”

11:17.660 --> 11:21.600
So he told Me that “This is what Your photograph
is.”

11:21.600 --> 11:24.670
So I said, “All right, now what do you want
Me to do?”

11:24.670 --> 11:29.470
I told him, “You can take this photograph
if you think it is so powerful.”

11:29.470 --> 11:33.530
So he took the photograph with such respect
and this thing.

11:33.530 --> 11:36.620
At least four, five times he bowed to Me.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.069
I said, “What do you want to do about it?”

11:38.069 --> 11:41.300
He said that “I want to put it on a satellite.”

11:41.300 --> 11:44.590
Now see the projection part – satellite.

11:44.590 --> 11:46.639
“Then what will you do?”

11:46.639 --> 11:54.859
“And I’m going to put electromagnetic
force behind it so this will, the power that

11:54.859 --> 11:59.650
is in this one, will penetrate into things.

11:59.650 --> 12:05.019
Because electromagnet can penetrate, with
that these vibrations will also penetrate.

12:05.019 --> 12:13.829
So I will go onto the satellite and from there
I’ll project this and I’ll see the global

12:13.829 --> 12:19.730
problems.

12:19.730 --> 12:23.299
Then wherever I’ll project this the problems
will be solved.

12:23.299 --> 12:29.319
I’ll try to first of all make the land fertile
with this.”

12:29.319 --> 12:32.259
One photograph of Mine, can you imagine?

12:32.259 --> 12:33.699
See his projection.

12:33.699 --> 12:35.009
I was amazed, you see.

12:35.009 --> 12:37.280
I said, “Look at this man.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.100
What he has been thinking all the time.”

12:39.100 --> 12:43.769
He said, “This is not difficult, it’s
not difficult.”

12:43.769 --> 12:44.769
I said, “How?”

12:44.769 --> 12:48.889
So he showed Me with a spring, you know, something
was like a spring.

12:48.889 --> 12:55.710
He put it on water which I had vibrated and
the spring started jumping.

12:55.710 --> 13:00.689
And then he showed with his machine that the
whole thing was moving so fast, you see.

13:00.689 --> 13:04.939
“Mother, just see the water that You have
vibrated, how great it is.”

13:04.939 --> 13:11.619
I said, “This is, I’ve never heard that
you can transform this power into something

13:11.619 --> 13:14.319
which will work out on material thing.”

13:14.319 --> 13:17.759
He said, “This power can work out in anything.

13:17.759 --> 13:22.120
It is this power which has created everything,
so it will work out in everything.”

13:22.120 --> 13:28.519
I was so surprised, and he said, “I’ve
been just waiting to meet You and this I’m

13:28.519 --> 13:29.519
going to start.

13:29.519 --> 13:32.350
I’ve got a lot of work to be done.”

13:32.350 --> 13:36.910
And he told his friend, “Now let’s go,
we have lot of work to be done.

13:36.910 --> 13:40.060
I want to do all this in the lifetime of Mother.

13:40.060 --> 13:42.829
She should see what we have to do.”

13:42.829 --> 13:51.799
I was amazed from where this fellow has dropped
on this earth.

13:51.799 --> 14:01.670
Such an experience of a scientist.

14:01.670 --> 14:06.269
In the West, no scientist will even look at
Me.

14:06.269 --> 14:11.749
Nobody will think that they can do something
about these vibrations.

14:11.749 --> 14:18.770
But you see, he has already developed a method
by which he can measure the vibrations, you

14:18.770 --> 14:19.770
see.

14:19.770 --> 14:24.379
I don’t know, I didn’t ask him any further
questions because I thought he’s too much

14:24.379 --> 14:27.340
in it and let him do what he likes.

14:27.340 --> 14:42.400
And you see, I find that in Russia, people
are very highly placed and they have many

14:42.400 --> 14:47.850
ideas, but spirituality is the main thing,
and morality.

14:47.850 --> 14:53.480
There was another gentleman I would say he
was hardly about thirty, thirty-two years

14:53.480 --> 14:56.220
of age, very much sparkling.

14:56.220 --> 15:01.980
He came, I asked him, “What do you want
Me to do?”

15:01.980 --> 15:07.710
He said, “No, You have done too much for
us, now we’ll do for You.”

15:07.710 --> 15:09.679
“So what do you want to do?”

15:09.679 --> 15:12.359
He said, “I’m in charge here of spirituality.”

15:12.359 --> 15:14.210
Can you imagine?

15:14.210 --> 15:20.449
We have no such government where there is
a subject like spirituality that somebody

15:20.449 --> 15:22.379
is in charge of spirituality.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.379
This is Russia.

15:23.379 --> 15:26.790
I said, “You are in charge of spirituality?”

15:26.790 --> 15:35.150
“Yes, and I have to deal with students from
very young age to the college.

15:35.150 --> 15:42.540
And can You tell me, Mother, at what age the
children are more receptive of spirituality?”

15:42.540 --> 15:49.280
I said “There is no hard and fast rule about
it.

15:49.280 --> 15:57.040
But as children, very small children because
they are so innocent, it works out.”

15:57.040 --> 16:03.199
So he asked Me, “How do we put spirituality
into them?”

16:03.199 --> 16:08.509
I said “You can raise their Kundalini, you
can tie them up and they will become really

16:08.509 --> 16:13.419
people with such an attention that you will
be amazed at that.”

16:13.419 --> 16:18.769
He said “I’m gathering all the people
of all the faiths and I’m going to tell

16:18.769 --> 16:22.829
them that it’s only Sahaja Yoga which is
the right path.”

16:22.829 --> 16:25.319
Can you imagine?

16:25.319 --> 16:31.199
Such a wonderful person, hardly thirty-two
years of age, I mean one better than the other,

16:31.199 --> 16:32.280
I thought.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.780
One really better than the other.

16:33.780 --> 16:40.360
Then he asked Me the schemes, “What should
we do for patriotism, what should we do for

16:40.360 --> 16:41.400
this...”

16:41.400 --> 16:51.439
He was so much alert and he said, “Through
spirituality, how can we improve their lives?

16:51.439 --> 16:53.669
Of the students?”

16:53.669 --> 17:02.449
Now he’s in charge of all the students of
Russia and he is also a member of the parliament.

17:02.449 --> 17:09.269
He said, “There are other eight, nine members
who are also in the same committee and they

17:09.269 --> 17:15.990
want spirituality to grow.”

17:15.990 --> 17:16.990
I was amazed.

17:16.990 --> 17:19.100
I mean what a country is this Russia?

17:19.100 --> 17:20.470
How could they have such people?

17:20.470 --> 17:23.910
Then the third one came.

17:23.910 --> 17:28.330
He was also member of parliament, very dynamic.

17:28.330 --> 17:34.740
First he was right hand man of Yeltsin but
then he gave him up.

17:34.740 --> 17:35.970
He said, “He’s not moral.

17:35.970 --> 17:39.790
I don’t want to have anything to do with
a person who’s not moral.”

17:39.790 --> 17:41.850
“So now what are you doing?”

17:41.850 --> 17:48.930
He said, “Now we are thinking of getting
elected by some, another party.

17:48.930 --> 17:50.779
Name is My Motherland.”

17:50.779 --> 17:53.080
I said, “Very good idea.”

17:53.080 --> 17:59.580
“So in that we’ll not have fixed ideas
like it is a democracy or a, you can call

17:59.580 --> 18:02.200
it, communism or this.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.750
But whatever suits my motherland, that we’ll
have.”

18:04.750 --> 18:13.230
It’s a very practical, is a most practical
thing that whatever will be good for my motherland,

18:13.230 --> 18:14.760
that we will have.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.779
Nothing else.

18:15.779 --> 18:19.049
I said, “Really this is very practical.”

18:19.049 --> 18:24.080
And he may one day replace this Yeltsin and
all that.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.830
Very dynamic, very nice.

18:26.830 --> 18:33.370
Just now he was little bit depressed, because
he said, “They are stupid people over here,”

18:33.370 --> 18:35.299
and this and that.

18:35.299 --> 18:39.590
But then he got very hopeful, I said, “We’ll
help you all out” and that.

18:39.590 --> 18:42.060
But such a truthful man.

18:42.060 --> 18:48.750
And he said, “The basis of human life is
morality.

18:48.750 --> 18:53.070
If you have no morality, then all the rest
is nonsense.”

18:53.070 --> 18:59.690
He studied in England and he said also in
America for quite some time, and the other

18:59.690 --> 19:00.690
fellow had studied.

19:00.690 --> 19:06.620
And they said in America they got fed up absolutely
and, “We don’t want to go back there.”

19:06.620 --> 19:14.039
So the wisdom of these people really was very
striking to Me.

19:14.039 --> 19:21.899
Now the another, third thing, which I discovered
is even much more deeper than this.

19:21.899 --> 19:32.250
When I went to Ukraine, I saw some very nice
paintings done with a very aboriginal sort

19:32.250 --> 19:34.330
of colors.

19:34.330 --> 19:39.060
So they said, “Mother, this we had before
the Christians came in.”

19:39.060 --> 19:47.860
They showed Me a magazine in which there was
a photograph of the Primordial Mother and

19:47.860 --> 19:49.399
they called it Aditi, that’s Sanskrit.

19:49.399 --> 19:51.399
We too also call it Aditi.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.870
Can you imagine?

19:52.870 --> 19:59.380
Then they said, “This culture existed before
the Christian aggression came in.”

19:59.380 --> 20:09.419
And there was paintings of Mooladhara Chakra
in different ways and also of Agnya Chakra.

20:09.419 --> 20:15.130
And the way they were talking about all this,
even in the magazine, I was really surprised.

20:15.130 --> 20:27.539
They said that “All this was published,
we have books on this, but because of the

20:27.539 --> 20:33.570
church it was all said, “It’s all nonsense,
there’s nothing like Aditi.”

20:33.570 --> 20:49.120
But the best part I saw was the picture of
the Aditi and there was a Kundalini in Her

20:49.120 --> 20:50.120
stomach.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.500
Or stomach or lopa.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.570
And was shown going upward like that.

20:54.570 --> 20:57.980
I said, “Look at this culture these people
had.”

20:57.980 --> 21:06.169
Then they said, “We had relations with India,
and they were Aryans and we were also Aryans

21:06.169 --> 21:08.680
and we used to meet them.”

21:08.680 --> 21:14.330
So I thought, Macchindranath and all these
people had gone to the north of India, they

21:14.330 --> 21:20.769
might have come to this Ukraine, and they
said that, I mean the whole thing was traced

21:20.769 --> 21:27.290
to - Ukraine name came from Kuru and all kinds
of things were traced in Sanskrit.

21:27.290 --> 21:28.730
All this I was amazed.

21:28.730 --> 21:32.049
What a culture they had!

21:32.049 --> 21:34.009
In what culture they lived!

21:34.009 --> 21:36.980
It’s something, you know, unbelievable.

21:36.980 --> 21:40.600
While in India there are many people who don’t
know what is Kundalini.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.270
If you tell them Kundalini, they think Kundalini
means horoscope.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.299
Especially in the North they have no idea
of Kundalini.

21:47.299 --> 21:55.940
But here are the people who have really, have
lived in a culture for thousands of years,

21:55.940 --> 22:00.310
and they said this was before Christ three
thousand years.

22:00.310 --> 22:01.310
Can you imagine?

22:01.310 --> 22:02.440
Before Christ, three thousand.

22:02.440 --> 22:09.520
And, so we too had civilizations in India,
like Harapa and all that of that time.

22:09.520 --> 22:14.669
But they said India is the source of spirituality.

22:14.669 --> 22:19.290
That magazine, I was amazed at it and the
way it was done.

22:19.290 --> 22:24.610
And the Mooladhara and the Agnya Chakra and
all that done so well.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.639
Maybe they might have seen it.

22:26.639 --> 22:33.259
They might not have got Realization but they
talked about Realization and also about achieving

22:33.259 --> 22:35.450
Self-hood.

22:35.450 --> 22:37.590
This was so many years back.

22:37.590 --> 22:42.899
But then they said, “The Christian religion
came and they told us, ‘It’s all nonsense,

22:42.899 --> 22:44.320
have nothing to do with it.’”

22:44.320 --> 22:51.409
As they told Me also in Greece that they had
Athena and Primordial Mother and all that.

22:51.409 --> 22:53.180
But they said, “No Mother, nothing.

22:53.180 --> 22:54.379
Better stop it.”

22:54.379 --> 22:57.789
So it was all cancelled and nobody looked
at it.

22:57.789 --> 23:05.260
But can you imagine that so many years back
it existed in that Ukraine?

23:05.260 --> 23:09.000
Such a beautiful culture of spirituality.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.680
First time I went to Ukraine we had people
there.

23:12.680 --> 23:21.580
There was a Chernobyl, you know that, was
a big explosion and they were all - like somebody

23:21.580 --> 23:26.539
had these fingers cut out or you can say,
attached to each other.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.580
Somebody had boils all over the body.

23:28.580 --> 23:33.240
Somebody’s nose was turned like that and
horrible looking like lepers they were, all

23:33.240 --> 23:37.370
of them, those who came to the program.

23:37.370 --> 23:42.490
But then this time, more than this were the
people there in Ukraine, I must tell you,

23:42.490 --> 23:44.169
much more than that.

23:44.169 --> 23:50.950
The whole hall was full, the three tier was
full, the passages were full and still the

23:50.950 --> 23:54.669
people outside were standing.

23:54.669 --> 24:00.159
And they said, “We were the ones who suffered
from this and now look at us we are completely

24:00.159 --> 24:01.159
cured.”

24:01.159 --> 24:03.490
You won’t believe, I never touched anyone.

24:03.490 --> 24:11.549
I was there only once, they came to My program
and they got cured.

24:11.549 --> 24:13.570
So this sensitivity that they had.

24:13.570 --> 24:21.190
I used to wonder why these Russians and Ukrainians
are so sensitive to spirituality.

24:21.190 --> 24:28.299
Then I realized that these people who have
got spirituality is ancient.

24:28.299 --> 24:31.580
From ancient times they were practising this.

24:31.580 --> 24:35.409
And we had Macchindranath, Gorakhnath - all
these people.

24:35.409 --> 24:41.620
But nobody practiced Kundalini awakening to
this extent that it was in every village they

24:41.620 --> 24:49.970
used to make the paintings about Mooladhara,
about this another Agnya Chakra very clearly.

24:49.970 --> 24:58.009
And in the Agnya Chakra was Ing and Ang of
the Chinese, can you imagine?

24:58.009 --> 25:03.669
After discovering that, I really felt that
in the world there must be lots of people

25:03.669 --> 25:04.669
like that.

25:04.669 --> 25:11.250
Now in Colombia I have seen also, they have
the same Kundalini and a Kumba and everything.

25:11.250 --> 25:14.450
I think that’s even more than that.

25:14.450 --> 25:18.400
Three, four thousand years back before Christ.

25:18.400 --> 25:30.340
So what we find, that we had all this knowledge
in all these countries and is still, that

25:30.340 --> 25:34.399
knowledge is still, working in the minds of
the people.

25:34.399 --> 25:48.230
They are very introspective and also they
know a lot about the sun.

25:48.230 --> 25:55.909
It is this kind of sensitivity comes only
when, basically in the roots of that country

25:55.909 --> 26:00.049
you have exposure to spirituality.

26:00.049 --> 26:08.040
It’s a kind of a miraculous revelation one
could see there.

26:08.040 --> 26:16.210
How they knew everything about Kundalini,
about the Primordial Mother, about this happening,

26:16.210 --> 26:23.240
about spirituality and what happens to a person
when he becomes a realized soul.

26:23.240 --> 26:31.560
The speciality I saw about them, they’re
extremely humble people.

26:31.560 --> 26:37.450
To them I am really, I don’t know, how they
bow to Me and it’s, sometimes I just can’t

26:37.450 --> 26:43.700
imagine how these people have such sense of
spirituality and such peace.

26:43.700 --> 26:49.909
When they had this coup, I asked them, “Aren’t
you worried?

26:49.909 --> 26:53.070
This coup is here and I don’t know what
will happen to your country.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.080
Aren’t you worried?”

26:54.080 --> 26:56.450
They said, “Mother why should we worry?

26:56.450 --> 26:59.639
After all we are in the Kingdom of God.

26:59.639 --> 27:05.049
We are not living in Russia, we are living
in the Kingdom of God.

27:05.049 --> 27:09.159
So why should we worry?”

27:09.159 --> 27:14.840
And meeting such nice people there, such sensitive
people to spirituality.

27:14.840 --> 27:20.759
They have thrown away practically all the
false gurus, all the false gurus.

27:20.759 --> 27:24.180
And for Me they showed such respect and such
care.

27:24.180 --> 27:27.269
They had this conference only for Me.

27:27.269 --> 27:33.900
So now why I’m telling you all this, that
now you all have got Realization.

27:33.900 --> 27:45.169
You have now felt your Spirit and you have
entered into the Kingdom of God, no doubt.

27:45.169 --> 27:55.129
But now you must understand that this power
that you have, what it does to you.

27:55.129 --> 28:00.549
What it creates in you.

28:00.549 --> 28:11.279
The most important thing is by this power
you become thoughtlessly aware.

28:11.279 --> 28:15.070
That is you come in the present.

28:15.070 --> 28:23.950
To achieve the present is an impossible task.

28:23.950 --> 28:30.860
So you, once you are in thoughtless awareness
what happens that no thoughts bombard your

28:30.860 --> 28:31.860
mind.

28:31.860 --> 28:36.340
Wherever you may be, you may be in America,
you may be in any place.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.539
You are not bombarded by thoughts.

28:39.539 --> 28:43.799
So, what does that mean?

28:43.799 --> 28:52.030
Into very simple language we can say, it means
that you do not reflect.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.940
You do not have a reflecting mind.

28:54.940 --> 29:05.450
Now this is the basic problem of Sahaja Yogis
of today, which one should try to conquer.

29:05.450 --> 29:06.810
That you do not reflect.

29:06.810 --> 29:13.419
That’s the only way you can achieve your
steadiness.

29:13.419 --> 29:23.029
For example I have seen people, for nothing
at all they’ll just start laughing, nothing

29:23.029 --> 29:24.570
at all.

29:24.570 --> 29:32.779
They see somebody, immediately they react
– “This was nice but not so good.”

29:32.779 --> 29:37.379
They start giving their opinions, especially
in the West, about everything.

29:37.379 --> 29:46.620
Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable and
start telling what is best and what is not

29:46.620 --> 29:49.019
the best, what is not good.

29:49.019 --> 29:57.360
And once they start saying something like
that, mind becomes reflective.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.379
If the mind is not reflective, then you are
thoughtless awareness.

30:01.379 --> 30:04.470
Watch anything, just you watch.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.960
Just witness.

30:05.960 --> 30:06.960
You should not reflect.

30:06.960 --> 30:14.770
If you are using your mental power, then this
power subsides.

30:14.770 --> 30:22.070
This is a very common defect with people because,
I think, you people are more intelligent,

30:22.070 --> 30:23.070
you think.

30:23.070 --> 30:26.460
Maybe, I think, you are well educated, might
be.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.529
I don’t know, whatever you think.

30:28.529 --> 30:34.080
But this reflecting mind is a very dangerous
thing for spirituality.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.259
You’ll never grow.

30:36.259 --> 30:43.310
And then with the reflecting mind, you have
different emotions with something you reflect

30:43.310 --> 30:45.090
on somebody.

30:45.090 --> 30:51.820
Now if it’s your son or daughter or something,
you get identified.

30:51.820 --> 30:54.720
Identification with some is artificial.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.919
It’s not in reality.

30:57.919 --> 31:02.669
But because this mind reflects, it identifies.

31:02.669 --> 31:05.259
Now many identifications you have dropped
out.

31:05.259 --> 31:13.220
For example your bias about religion, about
races, about maybe nationalities, you have

31:13.220 --> 31:14.549
dropped out.

31:14.549 --> 31:21.919
But still I would say, the reflecting mind
still acts and this is the greatest hurdle

31:21.919 --> 31:24.310
for the progress of Sahaja Yogis of today.

31:24.310 --> 31:34.029
I’ve been thinking, “Why is it the reflecting
mind is so active in Sahaja Yogis of today?”

31:34.029 --> 31:45.009
If you could stop reflecting, immediately
you establish yourself in the ocean of peace.

31:45.009 --> 31:48.899
You watch something, just watch.

31:48.899 --> 31:53.480
There’s no ripple of thought in your mind.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.890
Then you become extremely creative.

31:56.890 --> 32:01.159
You become extremely dynamic, you become extremely
compassionate.

32:01.159 --> 32:03.149
You have no fear.

32:03.149 --> 32:08.549
Some people think, “If you are compassionate
you see this man might lynch me”.

32:08.549 --> 32:10.620
You have no fear.

32:10.620 --> 32:19.149
All virtues that you have to enjoy you can
only enjoy when you do not reflect.

32:19.149 --> 32:23.950
That means that you leave everything to the
Divine.

32:23.950 --> 32:26.230
You are not in charge.

32:26.230 --> 32:32.629
You don’t see that you have to be reflecting
on something.

32:32.629 --> 32:41.869
This is the greatest power you have got, is
not to reflect, not to look at somebody with

32:41.869 --> 32:43.379
that kind of thing.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.980
I have seen this is still there lingering.

32:45.980 --> 32:49.159
Perhaps I never told you about it, maybe one
of the reasons.

32:49.159 --> 32:57.720
I don’t say that it’s only your fault
but maybe Mine, because I couldn’t find

32:57.720 --> 33:07.619
what was exactly wrong, that is the reflection
that you have about others.

33:07.619 --> 33:11.259
Now I told you, have introspection.

33:11.259 --> 33:20.690
For introspection also it can be reflection,
but that at least gives you idea as to where

33:20.690 --> 33:21.690
you are.

33:21.690 --> 33:26.369
But with that psychologically you can become
extremely depressed.

33:26.369 --> 33:29.810
You can condemn yourself.

33:29.810 --> 33:38.159
Then you may not understand yourself as a
personality that you are and you’ll go on,

33:38.159 --> 33:43.749
sort of, losing your vibrations, losing your
power.

33:43.749 --> 33:48.210
Because you are not control of yourself.

33:48.210 --> 33:56.419
So introspection, also, if it brings about
depression and demeaning of your personality,

33:56.419 --> 33:59.040
best is not to introspect also.

33:59.040 --> 34:04.340
Because all these mental activities, I have
seen, create problems.

34:04.340 --> 34:14.210
But in a state where you are thoughtlessly
aware, introspection comes to you automatically.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.290
You see it automatically.

34:16.290 --> 34:18.609
You understand it automatically.

34:18.609 --> 34:25.830
You do not think about it, it just comes to
you.

34:25.830 --> 34:32.430
The whole picture comes to you and you are
at peace with yourself.

34:32.430 --> 34:36.530
You are never in turmoil, never in trouble.

34:36.530 --> 34:39.089
Then you don’t get angry.

34:39.089 --> 34:48.290
Then you do not argue, then you do not discuss,
but you become as if dropped in to the ocean

34:48.290 --> 34:56.760
of awareness and you don’t have to worry
as to solve something.

34:56.760 --> 35:05.160
When you are reflecting, then you find that
this power works.

35:05.160 --> 35:11.920
Now it becomes very contradictory to say that
you have to project and you don’t have to

35:11.920 --> 35:14.030
reflect.

35:14.030 --> 35:17.309
Now when we reflect we absorb.

35:17.309 --> 35:23.040
When we reflect on something, we absorb that
thing.

35:23.040 --> 35:27.750
And mostly our attention goes to the defects
of others, “This person is no good, that

35:27.750 --> 35:32.630
is not good, this is, her hair is not all
right, the sari’s not all right.”

35:32.630 --> 35:36.250
This, that and all nonsense.

35:36.250 --> 35:41.180
So what are we doing, we are absorbing all
the bad things also.

35:41.180 --> 35:46.930
Now when you start admiration of something.

35:46.930 --> 35:55.069
Then what happens that you may not get the
good things but at least you are on a better

35:55.069 --> 35:56.069
line.

35:56.069 --> 36:01.870
But still, the admiration in thoughtless awareness
is really very deep.

36:01.870 --> 36:07.140
I saw this in the eyes of this great scientist.

36:07.140 --> 36:16.880
Absolutely he was just one with Me, and his
eyes were like an ocean of peace.

36:16.880 --> 36:25.970
He was just looking at Me, and for quite some
time and then he came to his thoughts and

36:25.970 --> 36:30.470
he told Me that “This is what we can do
with Your photograph.”

36:30.470 --> 36:36.260
So the depth in you will only come when you
do not reflect.

36:36.260 --> 36:40.890
But it’s very common with human beings,
specially in the West, “this carpet is no

36:40.890 --> 36:50.109
good, that is no good, this smell is coming,
that is there,” always trying to judge others,

36:50.109 --> 36:51.250
judge other things.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.810
This is important?

36:52.810 --> 36:54.370
What is so important?

36:54.370 --> 37:00.809
If you are sitting in the garden of heavens
what does it matter where you are sitting,

37:00.809 --> 37:05.260
what you are doing?

37:05.260 --> 37:12.240
This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves
of thoughts in our mind.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.560
I have already, once, described it by drawing.

37:16.560 --> 37:24.460
How the energy that falls on the right side
goes to the left side and the falls on the

37:24.460 --> 37:26.549
left goes to the right.

37:26.549 --> 37:33.330
Crosses over because of two types of cells
we have.

37:33.330 --> 37:40.560
Then out of this energy that goes to the right,
the energy that goes to the left it is sucked

37:40.560 --> 37:43.960
in partly into the sympathetic.

37:43.960 --> 37:50.180
Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects.

37:50.180 --> 37:53.359
That is the way it goes on reflecting.

37:53.359 --> 38:00.309
Now if you can suck in all that energy and
put it on our sympathetic, then all our energies

38:00.309 --> 38:02.390
will be thousand fold much more.

38:02.390 --> 38:12.230
We’ll not be tired, we’ll not be unhappy,
we’ll be able to stand lots of nonsense.

38:12.230 --> 38:16.590
But we’ll not call it a nonsense, we’ll
not think it’s a bad thing, so it has no

38:16.590 --> 38:20.160
effect on us.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.230
This quality we have to develop.

38:23.230 --> 38:29.839
I would say with this, today’s special celebration
of Navaratri.

38:29.839 --> 38:38.050
Like yesterday you saw the Durga’s nine
forms also.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.700
In that is one is Kushmanda.

38:39.700 --> 38:48.150
As this was told that you absorb all the filth
within yourself, in your stomach.

38:48.150 --> 38:50.940
But Devi does that, not you.

38:50.940 --> 38:55.010
What a Devi can do, you should not do.

38:55.010 --> 39:00.440
That’s Her job, that She’s supposed to
do these things, not you.

39:00.440 --> 39:10.079
What you have to do is to only be in silence
so that you absorb whatever will increase

39:10.079 --> 39:13.920
that silence, will increase your depth.

39:13.920 --> 39:17.859
Devi will look after all the other, rest of
the things.

39:17.859 --> 39:25.809
She will look after the, all the filth, all
the anger, all the temper, all the everything

39:25.809 --> 39:27.990
that’s going on in this world.

39:27.990 --> 39:36.170
She will absorb all that, but what you have
to do is to just enjoy everything that is

39:36.170 --> 39:37.230
pure.

39:37.230 --> 39:41.150
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond
your mind.

39:41.150 --> 39:43.809
With your mind you can never enjoy.

39:43.809 --> 39:46.380
It’s like a big load.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.740
It will not act, it will not help.

39:48.740 --> 39:57.650
Enjoyment comes when you are in complete silence,
in a rippleless lake.

39:57.650 --> 40:04.430
The reflection of all the joy that is created
on the shores of that lake are completely

40:04.430 --> 40:06.980
reflected, they are not deflected.

40:06.980 --> 40:12.150
If there were ripples it would have been a
different image altogether and would have

40:12.150 --> 40:19.020
been something nowhere near the image of reality.

40:19.020 --> 40:27.470
So one must have a mind which is kept lower
than reality.

40:27.470 --> 40:34.240
In the reality actually it is nothing but
peace and joy.

40:34.240 --> 40:41.980
Now a mother’s desire is always that children
should have nothing but peace and joy, no

40:41.980 --> 40:47.270
sufferings, no starvation, no ordeals, nothing.

40:47.270 --> 40:50.610
They must just enjoy.

40:50.610 --> 40:52.660
Now those days are gone.

40:52.660 --> 41:04.819
But even to enjoy this, even to live in that
complete peaceful state you have to be non-reflecting.

41:04.819 --> 41:18.700
Now you watch yourself, you’ll be amazed
how much reflecting you are.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.950
When Devi is doing all the job for you.

41:20.950 --> 41:29.650
When Paramchaitanya, I don’t know how many
things It is doing, is trying to fill up the

41:29.650 --> 41:33.349
whole atmosphere with It’s activity.

41:33.349 --> 41:38.820
What is your activity, should be to stop your
mental activity.

41:38.820 --> 41:43.990
You’ll be amazed in that state only, you
will grow.

41:43.990 --> 41:49.290
With that growth only you will become like
this scientist.

41:49.290 --> 41:57.910
How the contradiction now is that when you
have your depth you can project your depth,

41:57.910 --> 41:59.750
not your mind.

41:59.750 --> 42:04.530
Sometimes when I say “project,” people
think it is a projection of the mind.

42:04.530 --> 42:10.770
No. you have to project that depth, that reality
that is within you.

42:10.770 --> 42:16.470
For that you don’t have to think, you don’t
have to plan, it will just work.

42:16.470 --> 42:19.940
But you’ll be the instrument for that projection.

42:19.940 --> 42:22.930
It is nothing subtle.

42:22.930 --> 42:26.200
It is very simple to understand.

42:26.200 --> 42:30.380
Like I’m talking on this instrument, all
right?

42:30.380 --> 42:41.380
Now if this instrument is absolutely all right,
there’s no problem in it, it will be peaceful.

42:41.380 --> 42:51.460
But if this is full of ideas and thoughts
like our brain is, whatever I’m saying will

42:51.460 --> 42:56.210
not be the same that will be broadcasted.

42:56.210 --> 43:03.660
In the same way, when our mind is full of
turmoil and arguments and what you can say,

43:03.660 --> 43:12.299
comments, or we can also say the reflection,
then what happens is that this mind gets into

43:12.299 --> 43:30.780
like a whirlpool of disturbances and it cannot
project itself fully because it is disturbed.

43:30.780 --> 43:33.770
It is not a normal thing.

43:33.770 --> 43:37.180
So now you’ll understand there is no contradiction.

43:37.180 --> 43:42.859
You can only project yourself when you are
absolutely peaceful.

43:42.859 --> 43:45.840
And this is what we have to learn.

43:45.840 --> 43:55.690
This is Navaratri’s great days are here
and that you should know that it starts, actually,

43:55.690 --> 44:03.550
in the western world from the 21st, in the
equinox, after the equinox, in September.

44:03.550 --> 44:11.320
There are two Navaratri’s we have, you see,
one starts now and one starts after the second

44:11.320 --> 44:12.320
equinox.

44:12.320 --> 44:20.130
Now in this equinox, Mother Mary’s birthday
is there, equinox.

44:20.130 --> 44:22.370
And that’s why people celebrate Her birthday.

44:22.370 --> 44:27.299
They don’t know why She was born on equinox.

44:27.299 --> 44:30.130
For the balance.

44:30.130 --> 44:39.260
Then, you see, because nothing was explained
about the lives of these great incarnations,

44:39.260 --> 44:42.230
people use them the way they like.

44:42.230 --> 44:49.069
Because they have seen miracles with them,
so they do not try to understand why this

44:49.069 --> 44:55.230
equinox is there and why this is celebrated.

44:55.230 --> 45:01.900
Now I was told in Iran, this is the time they
have the new year.

45:01.900 --> 45:09.100
That means the Muslims observe this as a new
year, so when Navaratri starts is the new

45:09.100 --> 45:10.100
year.

45:10.100 --> 45:18.049
That means it’s the twelfth month for them
and so many things are suggestive of that,

45:18.049 --> 45:20.030
that why should it be twelve months.

45:20.030 --> 45:22.890
Why should the Goddess be born at twelve o’clock.

45:22.890 --> 45:28.400
All this has a special meaning and which you
can find out.

45:28.400 --> 45:33.819
But only possible when you are not reflecting.

45:33.819 --> 45:40.420
This is what is the state in which you are
really in connection with the all-pervading

45:40.420 --> 45:41.520
Power.

45:41.520 --> 45:47.579
Otherwise you are not there, you are not one
with that state.

45:47.579 --> 45:53.310
To be one with that state you have to be absolutely
silent within yourself.

45:53.310 --> 45:57.859
For the Goddess, She is silent.

45:57.859 --> 46:03.539
There’s a fight on, She’s silent, because
She’s so confident.

46:03.539 --> 46:05.640
She knows about Her powers.

46:05.640 --> 46:13.420
She knows Maheshasura or any asura cannot
trouble Her, cannot touch Her.

46:13.420 --> 46:18.180
She knows what are their powers are and She
knows all Her powers.

46:18.180 --> 46:22.500
So She doesn’t have to be disturbed by anything.

46:22.500 --> 46:29.299
She’s not disturbed because She’s really
the personification of this peace state, where

46:29.299 --> 46:31.970
She’s so powerful.

46:31.970 --> 46:35.099
She doesn’t have to know about Her powers.

46:35.099 --> 46:41.990
She doesn’t have to ask the powers to exert,
they just work, automatically.

46:41.990 --> 46:49.730
This is the state in which, you will be amazed,
so many things happen, unknowingly, without

46:49.730 --> 46:52.880
your doing anything.

46:52.880 --> 46:58.370
And that is what we call as coincidences,
but actually it is not coincidence.

46:58.370 --> 47:10.480
It is the state in which we are in a thoughtless
awareness, and then the Paramachaitanya is

47:10.480 --> 47:12.690
related to us.

47:12.690 --> 47:13.690
Absolutely related.

47:13.690 --> 47:14.730
We are there.

47:14.730 --> 47:18.070
And that works out everything for us.

47:18.070 --> 47:24.650
So in Sahaja Yoga, this time, as you know
about the Goddess, what She has done, so much

47:24.650 --> 47:27.600
work for years together.

47:27.600 --> 47:35.190
Now you all have become realized souls and
you must understand that complete confidence

47:35.190 --> 47:43.950
in yourself, complete understanding about
yourself, never to have any fear, never to

47:43.950 --> 47:49.900
have any thoughts which can bombard your mind.

47:49.900 --> 47:53.260
At that state you are the most powerful person.

47:53.260 --> 48:03.170
I hope, for this Navaratri, you will realize
what work the Goddess has done for you, how

48:03.170 --> 48:11.680
much She's worked hard, how much She's fought,
She’s been fighting with these horrible

48:11.680 --> 48:14.691
devils and rakshasas.

48:14.691 --> 48:25.809
And, sometimes I feel now, these devils are
within us, they're not outside, and that comes

48:25.809 --> 48:32.279
to us because we reflect too much on things.

48:32.279 --> 48:38.410
If you talk to any one of the western people
you're amazed, as if all the media they have

48:38.410 --> 48:39.820
on their heads.

48:39.820 --> 48:45.589
They know about each and every person, what
he did, what was this, what was that.

48:45.589 --> 48:49.460
But he's not worried.

48:49.460 --> 48:57.039
He doesn't think how he can improve it, how
you can work it out.

48:57.039 --> 49:05.990
At this state of thoughtless awareness you
encompass the whole universe, and at that

49:05.990 --> 49:11.970
state, this power works wherever the problem
may be.

49:11.970 --> 49:20.600
So we have to understand our value, that we
have this power within ourself, and this is

49:20.600 --> 49:26.910
to be respected and to give credit to the
Goddess because She's done so much work for

49:26.910 --> 49:34.950
us that She should not feel that it's now
they got Realization just for a song and they

49:34.950 --> 49:39.599
are not bothered, they don't know how to develop
it.

49:39.599 --> 49:51.210
She will not be in any way hurt but Her work,
what She has done, we have to see, we have

49:51.210 --> 50:01.680
to understand and we have to have a feeling
that somehow, as we now have got enlightenment,

50:01.680 --> 50:09.450
we should try to be people as complete instruments
of that power.

50:09.450 --> 50:16.170
That's only possible when you don't have your
own ideas, your own interference.

50:16.170 --> 50:25.059
Complete instrument, just like as I said,
this instrument has to be perfectly all right,

50:25.059 --> 50:27.160
otherwise it cannot work.

50:27.160 --> 50:29.589
Thank you very much.

50:29.589 --> 50:30.630
May God bless you!
