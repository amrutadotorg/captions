WEBVTT

00:00.669 --> 00:05.480
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:05.480 --> 00:23.721
That’s a very interesting subject that has
been given to Me to talk to you people because

00:23.721 --> 00:34.319
I have been always worried about the IAS,
IPS, and other Government servants, very much

00:34.319 --> 00:40.090
worried because I have known the kind of life
My husband was leading.

00:40.090 --> 00:52.260
And I used to think: if these new people,
who have come to the services, to the Government

00:52.260 --> 01:02.029
service, we have to tell them the dangers
that are ahead of them.

01:02.029 --> 01:07.400
Because we don’t know what is the subtle
system within us, which works.

01:07.400 --> 01:16.049
And in the subtle system, when we lead this
kind of a very speedy, intensive life, it

01:16.049 --> 01:17.289
has a defect.

01:17.289 --> 01:23.890
It has a defect you can see in the chart.

01:23.890 --> 01:36.580
They have shown the, they have shown the subtle
system which works it out.

01:36.580 --> 01:44.770
So we have a center here on the crossing of
the optic chiasma.

01:44.770 --> 01:52.119
These, this center is very important because
we react with this.

01:52.119 --> 01:55.409
We react to everything.

01:55.409 --> 02:02.810
By this reaction we create a problem within
ourselves.

02:02.810 --> 02:12.280
And this reaction comes to us because we do
not know how to go beyond the mind.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.580
Every time we are looking at something, we
react.

02:16.580 --> 02:20.200
We look at someone, we react.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.720
But we cannot just watch.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.640
We cannot be just the witness.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.830
If we could be the witness, it will not have
any effect on us.

02:29.830 --> 02:31.390
But we cannot be.

02:31.390 --> 02:35.970
That’s the trouble when this center is very
active.

02:35.970 --> 02:44.489
We call it as Agnya chakra, where the two
optic nerves meet.

02:44.489 --> 02:50.680
At the crossing point, this center is placed.

02:50.680 --> 02:55.690
Even Jung has said that, “You have to go
beyond your thoughts and that you have to

02:55.690 --> 02:58.409
become thoughtlessly aware.”

02:58.409 --> 03:04.930
Even in our Shastras is it written that, “You
have to have Nirvichar Samadhi,” is without

03:04.930 --> 03:09.270
thought and the another is Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

03:09.270 --> 03:15.090
Now even Einstein has said that, “You have
to go beyond the mind to reach the torsion

03:15.090 --> 03:16.170
area,” he calls.

03:16.170 --> 03:22.340
When he was searching for his Theory of Relativity,
he found it was difficult.

03:22.340 --> 03:23.750
He couldn’t find it.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.159
He got very tired.

03:25.159 --> 03:29.799
He went into his garden and was playing with
soap bubbles like a child.

03:29.799 --> 03:36.310
Then he says, “Suddenly from somewhere else
it dawned upon me this Theory of Relativity.”

03:36.310 --> 03:44.480
He calls it openly as a torsion area and this
torsion area we have to touch instead of ourselves

03:44.480 --> 03:46.640
thinking all the time and reacting.

03:46.640 --> 03:52.110
Because as a result of that what happens we
should see.

03:52.110 --> 04:00.640
What happens is that our movement on the autonomous
nervous system goes to the right side.

04:00.640 --> 04:06.390
The right side, it’s very good otherwise:
A person looks very impressive.

04:06.390 --> 04:08.189
He can oppress other.

04:08.189 --> 04:09.629
He can be aggressive.

04:09.629 --> 04:12.099
He can be very systematic.

04:12.099 --> 04:17.120
All these things can be there but it has a
reaction.

04:17.120 --> 04:25.850
The reaction is horrible because this right
side affects our liver to begin with.

04:25.850 --> 04:32.320
Now the liver is called ‘liver’ because
live, we live because of liver only.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.990
That’s why it’s called ‘liver’.

04:34.990 --> 04:41.820
This liver gets affected and there is no actually
treatment we should say in the medical science

04:41.820 --> 04:42.820
for liver.

04:42.820 --> 04:46.080
They can replace it with a pig’s liver or
some liver like that.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.070
But otherwise, there is no way out.

04:49.070 --> 04:55.360
But we are the ones we are spoiling this liver
ourself by creating tremendous heat in the

04:55.360 --> 04:56.890
liver.

04:56.890 --> 05:11.000
This special liver has got a capacity to absorb
heat and release heat into the blood stream

05:11.000 --> 05:14.550
and then, you see, it gets relieved of it.

05:14.550 --> 05:23.570
But when it is too much, when the liver is
too much full of heat then it cannot give

05:23.570 --> 05:27.030
up that heat.

05:27.030 --> 05:32.340
Then heat, this heat, heat starts traveling
upward.

05:32.340 --> 05:37.740
It can go to the right lung.

05:37.740 --> 05:41.610
It can go to the heart.

05:41.610 --> 05:46.200
Now imagine, right lung means asthma.

05:46.200 --> 05:50.480
Simple thing is asthma.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.740
Then it goes to the heart.

05:52.740 --> 06:00.180
There’s a young boy, say of twenty one years
or so, up to that age.

06:00.180 --> 06:06.160
He starts playing cricket, tennis, and drinks
a lot.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.040
Then he gets a massive heart attack.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.980
It’s fatal.

06:10.980 --> 06:13.880
He cannot live.

06:13.880 --> 06:20.220
Then it affects as I told you other organs
also.

06:20.220 --> 06:33.140
This heat goes to the pancreas causing diabetes
of a very serious nature, not of a mild nature

06:33.140 --> 06:35.120
but a very serious nature.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.990
Then this heat passes down to the spleen.

06:39.990 --> 06:45.540
In the spleen, it gives you blood cancer.

06:45.540 --> 06:49.130
This is all possible for all right sided people,
I am telling you.

06:49.130 --> 06:55.100
That’s why I was worried that people who
are, according to Me, are the spine of our

06:55.100 --> 06:56.100
country.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.320
They are the spine of our country.

06:59.320 --> 07:10.100
They should not get out of life because of
too much of strain and stress on their mind.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.020
Now then it goes to the kidneys.

07:12.020 --> 07:16.570
It coagulates the kidneys and you get kidney
trouble.

07:16.570 --> 07:21.030
You cannot pass urine and you have all the
troubles there.

07:21.030 --> 07:27.870
Apart from that, it goes to the lower intestines
and you get terrible constipations and all

07:27.870 --> 07:31.550
the problems of the constipation.

07:31.550 --> 07:38.530
Then also to the heart at a later age it comes.

07:38.530 --> 07:40.750
It goes on affecting.

07:40.750 --> 07:46.310
Ultimately your heart fails very early in
age.

07:46.310 --> 07:55.480
I know of, recently, two people died of heart
trouble who were at a very good position.

07:55.480 --> 08:05.090
This is very much worrying Me that how to
bring them to close to themselves, to know

08:05.090 --> 08:09.830
themselves what’s the problem is and how
to solve that problem.

08:09.830 --> 08:19.970
With this we understand that we react, by
reaction we create such a heat within us.

08:19.970 --> 08:27.680
Apart from this, the other psychosomatic diseases,
this is the, I am telling you about somatic,

08:27.680 --> 08:32.919
but the psycho disease which comes from your
psychological problems come from the left

08:32.919 --> 08:33.919
side.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.469
Of course I’ll not deal with that now.

08:36.469 --> 08:43.589
But somehow, if you can move from right to
the left, you are sure to get some psychosomatic

08:43.589 --> 08:51.300
trouble which cannot be cured by medical science,
like cancer, aches, all kinds of this.

08:51.300 --> 08:55.480
So you are just preparing your body for that.

08:55.480 --> 09:02.339
In these modern times, the life is so full
of struggle, speed.

09:02.339 --> 09:08.589
Now we were coming and there was a jam.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.629
Now you can’t help it.

09:10.629 --> 09:16.750
I was very silently watching, “Now this,
the jam, I have to reach late, doesn’t matter.”

09:16.750 --> 09:21.260
My husband normally would’ve been really
in great trouble.

09:21.260 --> 09:24.410
He would’ve looked at the watch all the
time.

09:24.410 --> 09:25.519
Would have been “Where are we?

09:25.519 --> 09:27.730
What are we doing?” this and that.

09:27.730 --> 09:34.290
But he was so silently watching the whole
thing, I was amazed because normally he would

09:34.290 --> 09:39.110
be jittering that we are getting so late for
a function like.

09:39.110 --> 09:50.949
Now, you see, once you get rid of this problem,
is the easiest thing to live.

09:50.949 --> 09:55.350
The other day I met one gentleman who was
transferred.

09:55.350 --> 09:57.139
He said “Always whenever!”

09:57.139 --> 10:03.980
He is an IAS officer, “Whenever I am transferred,
Mother, I used to be so jittery.

10:03.980 --> 10:06.709
Such tension, such stress on my mind, baba.

10:06.709 --> 10:07.860
What will happen?

10:07.860 --> 10:09.790
Where will the children go?

10:09.790 --> 10:11.790
What will happen to the house?

10:11.790 --> 10:15.500
This, that, all problems would come to me.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.450
But what has happened to me and my wife, we
don’t feel anything now.

10:19.450 --> 10:20.610
We don’t feel.

10:20.610 --> 10:22.129
We are not worried.

10:22.129 --> 10:23.629
We sleep very well.”

10:23.629 --> 10:26.180
I said, “That’s what has to happen.

10:26.180 --> 10:29.279
All these things should not affect you.”

10:29.279 --> 10:34.920
That’s only possible when you can go beyond
this mind, which we think.

10:34.920 --> 10:42.199
Mind is a, not such a good word, I should
say because it’s not mental.

10:42.199 --> 10:50.009
It is, if it is only mind means the one which
thinks and for them mental hospital is also

10:50.009 --> 10:51.009
mad people.

10:51.009 --> 10:54.410
I don’t know how English language moves,
it’s difficult you know.

10:54.410 --> 11:01.759
English language is very difficult to explain
Sahaja Yoga because in the English language

11:01.759 --> 11:06.730
you’ll be amazed that they call ‘spirit’.

11:06.730 --> 11:14.490
‘Spirit’ is the Atma, right, ‘spirit’
is the dead body moving about according to

11:14.490 --> 11:19.680
them and thirdly it means also alcohol.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.730
Now which one is closer to which one, I don’t
know, but this is why I am saying that English

11:24.730 --> 11:26.749
language is a difficult thing.

11:26.749 --> 11:33.540
Marathi is the best because lot of work has
been done among Maharashtrians on Kundalini.

11:33.540 --> 11:35.949
Nath Panthis were there.

11:35.949 --> 11:37.720
They have done lot of work.

11:37.720 --> 11:44.250
But the tradition was that one person would
give Realization to only one person.

11:44.250 --> 11:52.850
If I have done anything you think worth mentioning,
it is that I tried to find out a way of giving

11:52.850 --> 11:55.839
collective Realization, collective happening.

11:55.839 --> 12:03.670
That’s what was My humble contribution and
by which I find thousands of people have got

12:03.670 --> 12:05.160
their Realization.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.870
Now what is the Realization?

12:06.870 --> 12:15.389
It is that if you see at the base of the spinal
chord is a triangular bone called as ‘Sacrum’.

12:15.389 --> 12:22.670
It is called ‘Sacrum’ because it is a
sacred bone and the Greeks knew about it,

12:22.670 --> 12:24.589
that it’s a sacred bone.

12:24.589 --> 12:32.459
And according to our Shastras and also many
other prophecies, there resides a power within

12:32.459 --> 12:38.269
us, our own power, your own power called as
Kundalini.

12:38.269 --> 12:44.050
Is called ‘Kundalini’ because it is in
three and a half coils.

12:44.050 --> 12:48.910
Coils are called ‘kundal’, that’s why
it is the Kundalini.

12:48.910 --> 12:53.870
Now this, this power is your own.

12:53.870 --> 13:04.009
It’s in every human being and if it is awakened,
it passes through six centers piercing through

13:04.009 --> 13:11.430
the top of the head, which we call as the
Brahmarandhra in the Sanskrit language and

13:11.430 --> 13:14.069
the fontanel area in the English language.

13:14.069 --> 13:19.819
It passes through that soft bone which was
there in the childhood and you just start

13:19.819 --> 13:26.319
feeling the cool breeze coming out of your
head and the cool breeze coming on to your

13:26.319 --> 13:27.319
fingertips.

13:27.319 --> 13:28.319
It happens.

13:28.319 --> 13:32.470
It’s an experience and for which you cannot
pay.

13:32.470 --> 13:33.470
You cannot.

13:33.470 --> 13:36.889
I may go on telling you lots of stories this,
that, that won’t work out.

13:36.889 --> 13:38.399
It has to happen.

13:38.399 --> 13:44.779
The Kundalini has to rise and has to pierce
through fontanel area otherwise, otherwise,

13:44.779 --> 13:46.720
it’s no use.

13:46.720 --> 13:51.259
It’s just words, some sermon or something
like that.

13:51.259 --> 13:58.619
So this happening is very easy in this Kaliyuga.

13:58.619 --> 14:04.899
Is really remarkable because maybe because
of Kaliyug people are fed up of the things

14:04.899 --> 14:09.220
going on and all kinds of things working out.

14:09.220 --> 14:11.160
Now what does it do?

14:11.160 --> 14:15.079
It passes through six center.

14:15.079 --> 14:24.999
Six centers, these are meant for our physical,
mental, and emotional being and also for our

14:24.999 --> 14:26.220
spiritual being.

14:26.220 --> 14:33.310
So when it passes through these six centers,
it nourishes those centers, it integrates

14:33.310 --> 14:42.089
all these centers, and ultimately it passes
through this and enters into the all pervading

14:42.089 --> 14:46.850
power of Divine love, is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

14:46.850 --> 14:55.930
You may call it as ‘all pervading power
of Divine love’ or anything but names make

14:55.930 --> 14:56.930
no difference.

14:56.930 --> 15:04.680
There is a very subtle power around us, which
looks after us, which guides us, which helps

15:04.680 --> 15:07.620
us, which is the torsion area.

15:07.620 --> 15:17.510
Now, while doing that what happens that you
become knowledgeable of the absolute truth,

15:17.510 --> 15:18.510
absolute!

15:18.510 --> 15:25.309
Whatever you know is absolute, is nothing
to doubt, nothing can be challenged.

15:25.309 --> 15:30.720
For example, it starts flowing through your
fingertips.

15:30.720 --> 15:35.209
Starts flowing through your fingertips and
you can feel it on your fingertips, your centers.

15:35.209 --> 15:41.209
Now these are five, six, and seven centers,
five, six and seven centers.

15:41.209 --> 15:43.730
I am not going to tell you all the details
now.

15:43.730 --> 15:55.089
But when you start feeling these whole sensation,
Adi Shankaracharya has called it as ‘spand’,

15:55.089 --> 16:01.309
then you feel the truth, the real truth.

16:01.309 --> 16:08.369
For example, supposing in your office you
get somebody who is a cheat, very well dressed,

16:08.369 --> 16:12.619
speaks English very well, you know, very well
behaved.

16:12.619 --> 16:15.449
How will you make him out?

16:15.449 --> 16:19.450
Just have to put your hands under your table
and see for yourself.

16:19.450 --> 16:26.720
Immediately you will get some sort of a burning
sensation or you might feel some sort of a,

16:26.720 --> 16:31.759
what do you call, needle and pins like that.

16:31.759 --> 16:33.939
That kind of a feeling you might get.

16:33.939 --> 16:38.170
Then you will also know what centers he’s
catching on your fingertips.

16:38.170 --> 16:42.079
This is the absolute knowledge about everything.

16:42.079 --> 16:48.439
Is not question of only knowing he is a bad
or a good person, but also of diseases.

16:48.439 --> 16:53.810
Supposing you have some disease, you will
feel it on your fingertips.

16:53.810 --> 16:55.769
On your fingertips you’ll feel it.

16:55.769 --> 17:00.990
You’ll know this is your disease and if
you know how to cure them, you can cure others

17:00.990 --> 17:04.380
also because you become one with the whole.

17:04.380 --> 17:08.540
It’s a very collective personality you develop.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.000
Who is the other, after all?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.640
We are all one.

17:12.640 --> 17:18.160
But only trouble is we are separated because
of this ignorance.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.920
Once this works out, so many things drop out
from us.

17:22.920 --> 17:31.270
This is the right side I am telling you about
but also the conditionings are very much working

17:31.270 --> 17:32.270
out in us.

17:32.270 --> 17:36.010
In our reaction, there are two things that
work out.

17:36.010 --> 17:39.281
One is the right side, another the left side.

17:39.281 --> 17:43.050
And the left side is all the conditioning
as you see there.

17:43.050 --> 17:50.620
These conditionings come to us through our
childhood, through our family, through our

17:50.620 --> 17:56.230
country, through our reading, this, that all
kinds of things, they come up.

17:56.230 --> 18:06.940
But also family upbringing is very important
because according to our Shaastraas, there

18:06.940 --> 18:07.940
are six enemies.

18:07.940 --> 18:08.940
We have got six.

18:08.940 --> 18:10.560
Now these six enemies are what?

18:10.560 --> 18:15.530
So Kama, Krodha, Mada, Matsara, Lobha, Moha.

18:15.530 --> 18:19.160
Kama is what you can call sexual urge.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.670
Krodha is anger.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.180
Krishna has denounced anger.

18:23.180 --> 18:27.150
But all right sided people are hot tempered.

18:27.150 --> 18:30.270
They don’t want to be, but they are.

18:30.270 --> 18:33.390
And when they lose their temper then they
feel bad also.

18:33.390 --> 18:36.750
Not that they want to lose it but they just
lose it.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.700
Now this one drops out.

18:38.700 --> 18:47.870
The temper goes out completely because you
develop that witness state saakshi swaroopa.

18:47.870 --> 18:51.340
With that witness state you just see everything.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.160
You don’t lose temper.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.990
You just see it.

18:54.990 --> 18:58.060
That is one thing drops out very well.

18:58.060 --> 19:02.170
Mada is false pride.

19:02.170 --> 19:03.170
That we have.

19:03.170 --> 19:05.990
I know IAS officers and their wives.

19:05.990 --> 19:07.830
They have that false pride.

19:07.830 --> 19:12.360
Not everyone, but some of them do, they have.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.000
I have very funny experiences of that.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.780
Like, once we went to Delhi to Hatriji and
they had given us a house in Mina Bagh and

19:20.780 --> 19:25.800
I met another friend of Mine from Lucknow
who had married an IAS officer.

19:25.800 --> 19:30.540
Oh, very proud girl and she asked Me, “Where
are you living?

19:30.540 --> 19:31.540
How are you?”

19:31.540 --> 19:34.800
I said, “My husband is a government servant
and so he’s transferred here.”

19:34.800 --> 19:36.040
“But where are you living?”

19:36.040 --> 19:37.280
I said “Mina Bagh.”

19:37.280 --> 19:38.280
“Oh my God!

19:38.280 --> 19:39.280
Mina Bagh!

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
What is your husband doing?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.280
Is he a clerk?

19:41.280 --> 19:42.280
What is he doing?”

19:42.280 --> 19:46.880
I said, “He’s doing something” and I
was just looking at her the way she was on

19:46.880 --> 19:47.880
Me.

19:47.880 --> 19:51.190
“My husband might be your husband’s boss”
this and that.

19:51.190 --> 19:55.020
I said, “Maybe I don’t know anything about
these things.

19:55.020 --> 19:57.990
I am sorry, I don’t know your list of people,
anything.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.770
I am not interested.”

19:59.770 --> 20:02.150
And then My husband came.

20:02.150 --> 20:03.930
So she said, “See that tall man.

20:03.930 --> 20:06.430
You know he’s very important.

20:06.430 --> 20:08.320
He’s with the Prime Minister.

20:08.320 --> 20:12.570
You go and talk to him and get Your husband
promoted.”

20:12.570 --> 20:23.900
I said ([Laughing] What is she up to?), I
said, “Sudhali, he is My husband.”

20:23.900 --> 20:24.900
“Heh!

20:24.900 --> 20:26.540
He’s your husband?

20:26.540 --> 20:27.540
Haan yaar!

20:27.540 --> 20:28.940
Oh my God!

20:28.940 --> 20:30.870
I am sorry I am.”

20:30.870 --> 20:33.040
I said, “It’s all right.”

20:33.040 --> 20:34.040
Common experience.

20:34.040 --> 20:42.620
The women also become IAS, you see, not actually
but as wives and I’ve been such a lost person

20:42.620 --> 20:44.680
with them.

20:44.680 --> 20:50.860
I could never understand what is there to
be IAS and to be his wife.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.660
It was beyond Me.

20:52.660 --> 20:59.200
But one thing, what really helped Me in all
this turmoil of life, because you know our

20:59.200 --> 21:09.880
pay is less, this, that all problems are there,
was the patriotism Raashtra Bhakti.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.940
My father was a great patriot.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.100
My mother was.

21:13.100 --> 21:18.090
They sacrificed everything for the independence
of this country.

21:18.090 --> 21:23.520
I cannot travel by any foreign airlines, whatever
maybe.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.220
Maybe Air India is not good, doesn’t matter.

21:26.220 --> 21:28.550
It’s My, My country’s.

21:28.550 --> 21:35.480
So the feeling that this is My country kept
Me going.

21:35.480 --> 21:39.410
You see you become like a Kargil soldier.

21:39.410 --> 21:42.390
You are fighting for your country.

21:42.390 --> 21:47.320
You are working for your country.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.580
My husband got into Indian Foreign Service.

21:50.580 --> 21:51.920
I told him, “Nothing doing.

21:51.920 --> 21:56.610
We don’t drink, both of us and I can’t
leave My country in the lurch at the time

21:56.610 --> 21:58.650
when we have got the freedom.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.100
So if you want you can go, I will not come.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.260
I don’t want to go to Foreign Service.”

22:03.260 --> 22:04.700
They cut his pay.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.510
That time, you know, 300 was a big amount.

22:07.510 --> 22:09.130
I said, “Doesn’t matter.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.150
Whatever it is, I’ll stay in My country.

22:11.150 --> 22:13.640
I’ll work in My country and you work here.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.150
I’ll support you every way.

22:16.150 --> 22:18.830
I don’t want anything.

22:18.830 --> 22:25.740
Nothing I want and you don’t take a bribe
at all otherwise that day I’ll leave this.”

22:25.740 --> 22:33.650
Otherwise also I said that, “The another
thing is our country has to develop.”

22:33.650 --> 22:36.660
Who will develop?

22:36.660 --> 22:41.210
I always felt that you are the spinal cord
of our country.

22:41.210 --> 22:43.420
You have to develop this country.

22:43.420 --> 22:44.420
What is this money?

22:44.420 --> 22:45.420
Comes and goes.

22:45.420 --> 22:50.800
You’ve seen the people who have got money,
where their children have gone?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.360
What has happened to them?

22:53.360 --> 22:54.360
What have they achieved?

22:54.360 --> 22:59.080
So I told very frankly that I will not go
to the Foreign Service of any kind because

22:59.080 --> 23:00.720
what is in the Foreign Service?

23:00.720 --> 23:06.760
I want to do everything in this country of
Mine for which I have also fought.

23:06.760 --> 23:14.150
I have fought a lot and this is what now sometimes,
you know, is disappointing to see what things

23:14.150 --> 23:15.240
are happening.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.600
But a day will come.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.390
This country will rise.

23:18.390 --> 23:19.390
How?

23:19.390 --> 23:24.950
Because when this happens, when this Kundalini
rising take place, when people become realized

23:24.950 --> 23:27.470
souls, they just transform.

23:27.470 --> 23:35.040
They become extremely patriotic, extremely
patriotic and they understand what is needed

23:35.040 --> 23:37.340
today for our country.

23:37.340 --> 23:39.280
They can sacrifice anything.

23:39.280 --> 23:48.240
They can live anywhere and they are not bothered
about some sort of a, you can call it a financial

23:48.240 --> 23:51.070
help or other material thing.

23:51.070 --> 23:53.330
They are above materialism.

23:53.330 --> 24:01.250
There are thousands and thousands like that
even in our country, thousands and also abroad.

24:01.250 --> 24:04.080
Now Sahaja Yoga is working 86 countries.

24:04.080 --> 24:13.210
They are all full of joy because with this
happening you get joy of a quality which has

24:13.210 --> 24:14.210
no double thing.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.490
It’s not happiness / unhappiness.

24:15.490 --> 24:22.720
It’s just joy and you have another thing
also with it, is the peace of mind.

24:22.720 --> 24:27.040
Just you are so peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.580
You don’t have to worry about things.

24:31.580 --> 24:37.730
You don’t have to become jittery because
see the diseases you develop.

24:37.730 --> 24:42.050
Apart from that, all kinds of paralysis comes
on us.

24:42.050 --> 24:47.420
We had a doctor in our hospital there who
was working very hard.

24:47.420 --> 24:51.050
I told him that, “Doctor, see now your age
has come.

24:51.050 --> 24:52.560
You should take it easy.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.120
Daytime you must rest.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.290
There’s no need.

24:55.290 --> 24:59.340
You are not in a office, just rest, take rest
do something else.

24:59.340 --> 25:01.770
Read or you can go and play.

25:01.770 --> 25:02.770
Do something.”

25:02.770 --> 25:09.100
He wouldn’t listen to Me and then he got
paraplegia, means that failure of the hand

25:09.100 --> 25:10.730
and the leg, completely.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.000
He couldn’t even walk.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.150
He couldn’t lift his leg.

25:14.150 --> 25:16.310
Now he’s all right, cured.

25:16.310 --> 25:20.310
But then I told him that you take treatment
for your right side.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.090
That’s very important.

25:22.090 --> 25:27.710
It’s very simple treatment and which can
be done very easily.

25:27.710 --> 25:32.050
For example, you can have an ice bag on the
liver.

25:32.050 --> 25:35.800
You can have ice bag here because this is
the portion.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.910
This moves like this so the portion this one
gets heated up.

25:39.910 --> 25:44.030
So you put ice here, you put ice.

25:44.030 --> 25:47.890
This icing business will really help you a
lot.

25:47.890 --> 25:55.040
But also there are some other very simple
homely treatments which you can take.

25:55.040 --> 25:59.460
But I would request all of you to come to
our center somewhere in

25:59.460 --> 26:01.290
Mother talks aside: [Bhaaratiya?

26:01.290 --> 26:02.660
Wahan hai na?

26:02.660 --> 26:04.950
Bharatiya, usmein hai ki nahi?]

26:04.950 --> 26:06.740
Where is she gone?

26:06.740 --> 26:09.910
Somebody says, “Bhaaratiya Vidya Peeth.”

26:09.910 --> 26:15.060
Shri Mataji: So you all can come there if
you live in this area.

26:15.060 --> 26:17.870
In every area, we have got centers.

26:17.870 --> 26:21.020
So you all can come into that center humbly.

26:21.020 --> 26:28.330
There is, you see, in Sahaja Yoga there is
nothing like any position or anything.

26:28.330 --> 26:29.980
We have to humble down.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.920
This false pride is of no use.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.090
We humble down.

26:34.090 --> 26:41.210
When we humble down, it’s very easy to achieve
it and to get this into yourself.

26:41.210 --> 26:43.520
After all, otherwise, what is it?

26:43.520 --> 26:46.030
What is life for?

26:46.030 --> 26:47.750
There’s no enjoyment.

26:47.750 --> 26:52.020
There’s no experiencing of what you are
doing.

26:52.020 --> 26:55.070
So much work you put in I know, I know that.

26:55.070 --> 26:58.370
I know how you people have to work hard.

26:58.370 --> 27:06.230
But to get over, to get over all the strain
and stress, you must do meditation for five

27:06.230 --> 27:08.420
minutes which they will tell you how to do
it.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.840
Five minutes in the evening will help you.

27:11.840 --> 27:19.420
So, just like as you take bath in the morning,
bathe yourself with the showers of this Kundalini.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.690
She’s your mother.

27:20.690 --> 27:29.462
She has been your mother from ages and she
has recorded everything about you within itself.

27:29.462 --> 27:35.270
This is the subtle side of you and when you
want to have your Realization, she’s very

27:35.270 --> 27:37.490
anxious to be awakened.

27:37.490 --> 27:41.100
She’s extremely anxious and it works wonders.

27:41.100 --> 27:46.480
I am surprised that how people get Realization
in no time.

27:46.480 --> 27:52.000
The only trouble with them is, it’s like
a primule or you can call it the ‘ankuraa’,

27:52.000 --> 27:55.250
which grows but it doesn’t become a tree.

27:55.250 --> 27:58.330
So, little bit you have to meditate.

27:58.330 --> 27:59.330
You have to be collective and works out.

27:59.330 --> 28:04.640
In collective, you forget everything, your
position everything.

28:04.640 --> 28:10.890
I have known IAS officers who have been dancing
with the villagers, singing with the villagers,

28:10.890 --> 28:12.080
so much they enjoy.

28:12.080 --> 28:16.930
They said, “We knew this but we never wanted
to express it, you see.”

28:16.930 --> 28:18.550
So all this drops out.

28:18.550 --> 28:23.590
All these outward bondages drop out and you
become one with the collective.

28:23.590 --> 28:24.870
You know their problems.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.790
You know how to solve them and it’s very
good.

28:28.790 --> 28:33.980
I think this is what is only one has to achieve,
nothing else.

28:33.980 --> 28:38.300
If you achieve this, you’ve achieved the
last and the best.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.620
With this then you can help others.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.880
You can give Realizations to others.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.110
You can save their lives.

28:45.110 --> 28:48.840
I mean, it’s all your power that is going
to work out.

28:48.840 --> 28:58.170
In these days of horrible struggle and all
kinds of things happening, violence, very

28:58.170 --> 29:01.780
much needed is this Sahaja Yoga.

29:01.780 --> 29:07.690
And you’ll be amazed, it is something a
grace that people get it.

29:07.690 --> 29:12.780
In Turkey, we have about two thousand people
who are realized souls.

29:12.780 --> 29:20.640
Nobody lost their life, not a single thing,
not their houses were even, they just little

29:20.640 --> 29:26.060
bit, I would say, shook but never fell down.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.400
The whole Orissa, it happened the same.

29:28.400 --> 29:36.410
It has happened in several places that people
have been just saved with those who have been

29:36.410 --> 29:39.350
in the grace of the Divine.

29:39.350 --> 29:40.750
We have to become that.

29:40.750 --> 29:42.810
We can’t live without it.

29:42.810 --> 29:44.040
It’s rather subtle.

29:44.040 --> 29:50.180
It is subtle, I know but sometimes must understand
we have to be subtle.

29:50.180 --> 30:00.660
Now as it is, so much of illness, sickness
I find, mostly I find with all the people

30:00.660 --> 30:03.960
who are working very hard is the right sided
problem.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.250
Some sort of a right side.

30:05.250 --> 30:13.730
And it can be absolutely cured, absolutely
be under your control, and you can cure others

30:13.730 --> 30:14.730
also.

30:14.730 --> 30:20.870
This is such a blessing we have in this horrible
Kaliyuga.

30:20.870 --> 30:27.010
The worst times, they say, the worst and worst
that is the time is now and you see the effects

30:27.010 --> 30:28.010
of that.

30:28.010 --> 30:31.820
But in that only, the lotus of Sahaja Yoga
has come up.

30:31.820 --> 30:34.240
You don’t have to pay for it.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.280
That’s one thing you should know.

30:36.280 --> 30:40.190
Anybody asks money from you, he’s not Divine.

30:40.190 --> 30:42.610
Don’t have to pay for it, at all.

30:42.610 --> 30:49.370
When you grow and when you achieve, when you
give Realizations to others, then you will

30:49.370 --> 30:55.590
be surprised you rise into a new realm of
understanding which is a doubtless awareness

30:55.590 --> 31:01.670
which is called as ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’
according to Patanjali.

31:01.670 --> 31:07.330
Now as we have learnt English, I don’t think
we read much of the, our Indian scriptures

31:07.330 --> 31:08.640
and thing.

31:08.640 --> 31:17.190
But that also, those who read will go on praying
to one monde of statues, this, that, I mean

31:17.190 --> 31:24.590
just they are fanatically religious people,
wasting their life like that.

31:24.590 --> 31:29.840
The another side are the buddhivaadis what
you call are the intellectuals, you see.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.010
They are the much worst because they think
they have read everything.

31:33.010 --> 31:34.010
They know everything.

31:34.010 --> 31:35.010
Now what to tell them?

31:35.010 --> 31:36.730
It’s a very simple thing, they don’t want
to accept.

31:36.730 --> 31:40.480
You can’t tell them, “Take it straight.”

31:40.480 --> 31:45.680
You have to have it in the other way.

31:45.680 --> 31:51.920
So also to understand it, we should know we
have not known ourselves.

31:51.920 --> 31:56.880
We have to know ourselves and for knowing
ourselves, Kundalini awakening is the only

31:56.880 --> 31:59.700
way, as far as I know.

31:59.700 --> 32:07.841
And I hope you all will think about it and
come to our centers where Realization can

32:07.841 --> 32:08.841
be given.

32:08.841 --> 32:11.150
There are many centers we have got.

32:11.150 --> 32:16.850
You don’t have to pay any money, nothing,
but you come and relax.

32:16.850 --> 32:20.910
Relaxation is only possible after Self-Realization,
not before that.

32:20.910 --> 32:24.850
You’ll be surprised your aging will stop.

32:24.850 --> 32:27.680
I have no aging problem.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.590
My husband also has no aging problem.

32:29.590 --> 32:31.490
We don’t think of it.

32:31.490 --> 32:32.490
It’s over.

32:32.490 --> 32:35.690
Now, whenever one has to die, one will die.

32:35.690 --> 32:39.900
But till then we are not bothered.

32:39.900 --> 32:45.670
Anything that you do will have a special light
of the Divine.

32:45.670 --> 32:51.880
I bless you from My heart that you develop
this subtle things within yourself and you

32:51.880 --> 32:56.410
try to understand that so far you have not
known yourself.

32:56.410 --> 32:57.740
You have to know yourself.

32:57.740 --> 33:02.430
You don’t have to introspect and sit down
criticizing yourself, feeling guilty.

33:02.430 --> 33:03.830
No, not at all.

33:03.830 --> 33:08.810
Whatever has happened has happened because
you’ll be amazed at yourself that all your

33:08.810 --> 33:12.500
destructive habits also will drop out by themselves.

33:12.500 --> 33:18.160
Overnight in London, there were twelve boys
with the addiction of drugs.

33:18.160 --> 33:22.610
They stopped over night, over night.

33:22.610 --> 33:24.050
I don’t, never told them.

33:24.050 --> 33:26.070
I never tell people, “Don’t, don’t.”

33:26.070 --> 33:27.600
I never say that.

33:27.600 --> 33:36.010
But that Kundalini rises and the light of
the, your heart, light of the Spirit, that

33:36.010 --> 33:37.400
guides you.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.990
That tells you what is destructive for you.

33:39.990 --> 33:45.150
And you have power not to accept anything
that is destructive.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.030
I know there are difficulties.

33:47.030 --> 33:50.870
I know there are problems but you’ll never
see them.

33:50.870 --> 33:55.590
If you are sitting in a boat, you are not
be bothered as to how deep the sea is.

33:55.590 --> 33:56.810
It’s like that.

33:56.810 --> 34:02.030
You rise above all these things and you watch
and you help others.

34:02.030 --> 34:05.720
Apart from that, it helps you in your work,
very much in your work.

34:05.720 --> 34:10.750
You understand your work very well because
of torsion area again.

34:10.750 --> 34:13.909
My husband says, “How do You get this idea?”

34:13.909 --> 34:15.069
I say, “I got it.

34:15.069 --> 34:18.940
All right this is the idea, I’ve got it.”

34:18.940 --> 34:21.819
Now he’s amazed sometimes how I manage things.

34:21.819 --> 34:22.819
How I am doing?

34:22.819 --> 34:24.159
I have no secretariat.

34:24.159 --> 34:25.749
I have no secretary.

34:25.749 --> 34:28.220
I have no P.A., nothing.

34:28.220 --> 34:31.009
And we are working in 86 countries.

34:31.009 --> 34:38.740
So it is just works out because it is this
Divine power which is so helpful or which

34:38.740 --> 35:51.950
is so kind.

35:51.950 --> 36:40.849
So again and again, I wish you best of luck.

36:40.849 --> 37:40.680
Please come to our centers.

37:40.680 --> 39:02.740
I hope they’ll give you the addresses and
all that and you

39:02.740 --> 40:05.599
can come on Saturdays or Sundays, whenever
you

40:05.599 --> 41:41.640
want to and

41:41.640 --> 42:20.150
get

42:20.150 --> 42:25.140
your Realization.

42:25.140 --> 42:43.930
May God bless you!

42:43.930 --> 43:50.609
Somebody says, “Shri Mataji, they

43:50.609 --> 47:32.289
are requesting, if

47:32.289 --> 01:04:20.490
you can give them Self Realization here?”
