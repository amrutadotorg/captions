00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.480
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:23.721
That’s a very interesting subject that has
been given to Me to talk to you people because

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:34.319
I have been always worried about the IAS,
IPS, and other Government servants, very much

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:40.090
worried because I have known the kind of life
My husband was leading.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:52.260
And I used to think: if these new people,
who have come to the services, to the Government

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.029
service, we have to tell them the dangers
that are ahead of them.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:07.400
Because we don’t know what is the subtle
system within us, which works.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.049
And in the subtle system, when we lead this
kind of a very speedy, intensive life, it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.289
has a defect.

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:23.890
It has a defect you can see in the chart.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:36.580
They have shown the, they have shown the subtle
system which works it out.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.770
So we have a center here on the crossing of
the optic chiasma.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.119
These, this center is very important because
we react with this.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.409
We react to everything.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.810
By this reaction we create a problem within
ourselves.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:12.280
And this reaction comes to us because we do
not know how to go beyond the mind.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.580
Every time we are looking at something, we
react.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.200
We look at someone, we react.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720
But we cannot just watch.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.640
We cannot be just the witness.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.830
If we could be the witness, it will not have
any effect on us.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.390
But we cannot be.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.970
That’s the trouble when this center is very
active.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.489
We call it as Agnya chakra, where the two
optic nerves meet.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.680
At the crossing point, this center is placed.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.690
Even Jung has said that, “You have to go
beyond your thoughts and that you have to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.409
become thoughtlessly aware.”

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.930
Even in our Shastras is it written that, “You
have to have Nirvichar Samadhi,” is without

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.270
thought and the another is Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.090
Now even Einstein has said that, “You have
to go beyond the mind to reach the torsion

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.170
area,” he calls.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.340
When he was searching for his Theory of Relativity,
he found it was difficult.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.750
He couldn’t find it.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.159
He got very tired.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.799
He went into his garden and was playing with
soap bubbles like a child.

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.310
Then he says, “Suddenly from somewhere else
it dawned upon me this Theory of Relativity.”

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:44.480
He calls it openly as a torsion area and this
torsion area we have to touch instead of ourselves

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.640
thinking all the time and reacting.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.110
Because as a result of that what happens we
should see.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:00.640
What happens is that our movement on the autonomous
nervous system goes to the right side.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.390
The right side, it’s very good otherwise:
A person looks very impressive.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.189
He can oppress other.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.629
He can be aggressive.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.099
He can be very systematic.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.120
All these things can be there but it has a
reaction.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:25.850
The reaction is horrible because this right
side affects our liver to begin with.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.320
Now the liver is called ‘liver’ because
live, we live because of liver only.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.990
That’s why it’s called ‘liver’.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.820
This liver gets affected and there is no actually
treatment we should say in the medical science

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.820
for liver.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.080
They can replace it with a pig’s liver or
some liver like that.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.070
But otherwise, there is no way out.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.360
But we are the ones we are spoiling this liver
ourself by creating tremendous heat in the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.890
liver.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:11.000
This special liver has got a capacity to absorb
heat and release heat into the blood stream

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.550
and then, you see, it gets relieved of it.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.570
But when it is too much, when the liver is
too much full of heat then it cannot give

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.030
up that heat.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.340
Then heat, this heat, heat starts traveling
upward.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.740
It can go to the right lung.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.610
It can go to the heart.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.200
Now imagine, right lung means asthma.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.480
Simple thing is asthma.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.740
Then it goes to the heart.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:00.180
There’s a young boy, say of twenty one years
or so, up to that age.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.160
He starts playing cricket, tennis, and drinks
a lot.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.040
Then he gets a massive heart attack.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.980
It’s fatal.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.880
He cannot live.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.220
Then it affects as I told you other organs
also.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:33.140
This heat goes to the pancreas causing diabetes
of a very serious nature, not of a mild nature

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.120
but a very serious nature.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.990
Then this heat passes down to the spleen.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.540
In the spleen, it gives you blood cancer.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.130
This is all possible for all right sided people,
I am telling you.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:55.100
That’s why I was worried that people who
are, according to Me, are the spine of our

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.100
country.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.320
They are the spine of our country.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:10.100
They should not get out of life because of
too much of strain and stress on their mind.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.020
Now then it goes to the kidneys.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.570
It coagulates the kidneys and you get kidney
trouble.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.030
You cannot pass urine and you have all the
troubles there.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:27.870
Apart from that, it goes to the lower intestines
and you get terrible constipations and all

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.550
the problems of the constipation.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:38.530
Then also to the heart at a later age it comes.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.750
It goes on affecting.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.310
Ultimately your heart fails very early in
age.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:55.480
I know of, recently, two people died of heart
trouble who were at a very good position.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:05.090
This is very much worrying Me that how to
bring them to close to themselves, to know

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.830
themselves what’s the problem is and how
to solve that problem.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:19.970
With this we understand that we react, by
reaction we create such a heat within us.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:27.680
Apart from this, the other psychosomatic diseases,
this is the, I am telling you about somatic,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.919
but the psycho disease which comes from your
psychological problems come from the left

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:33.919
side.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.469
Of course I’ll not deal with that now.

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:43.589
But somehow, if you can move from right to
the left, you are sure to get some psychosomatic

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:51.300
trouble which cannot be cured by medical science,
like cancer, aches, all kinds of this.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.480
So you are just preparing your body for that.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:02.339
In these modern times, the life is so full
of struggle, speed.

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:08.589
Now we were coming and there was a jam.

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:10.629
Now you can’t help it.

00:09:10.629 --> 00:09:16.750
I was very silently watching, “Now this,
the jam, I have to reach late, doesn’t matter.”

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.260
My husband normally would’ve been really
in great trouble.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.410
He would’ve looked at the watch all the
time.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.519
Would have been “Where are we?

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.730
What are we doing?” this and that.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:34.290
But he was so silently watching the whole
thing, I was amazed because normally he would

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.110
be jittering that we are getting so late for
a function like.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:50.949
Now, you see, once you get rid of this problem,
is the easiest thing to live.

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:55.350
The other day I met one gentleman who was
transferred.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.139
He said “Always whenever!”

00:09:57.139 --> 00:10:03.980
He is an IAS officer, “Whenever I am transferred,
Mother, I used to be so jittery.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.709
Such tension, such stress on my mind, baba.

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:07.860
What will happen?

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.790
Where will the children go?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.790
What will happen to the house?

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.500
This, that, all problems would come to me.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.450
But what has happened to me and my wife, we
don’t feel anything now.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.610
We don’t feel.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.129
We are not worried.

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:23.629
We sleep very well.”

00:10:23.629 --> 00:10:26.180
I said, “That’s what has to happen.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.279
All these things should not affect you.”

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:34.920
That’s only possible when you can go beyond
this mind, which we think.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:42.199
Mind is a, not such a good word, I should
say because it’s not mental.

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:50.009
It is, if it is only mind means the one which
thinks and for them mental hospital is also

00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:51.009
mad people.

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:54.410
I don’t know how English language moves,
it’s difficult you know.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:01.759
English language is very difficult to explain
Sahaja Yoga because in the English language

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:06.730
you’ll be amazed that they call ‘spirit’.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:14.490
‘Spirit’ is the Atma, right, ‘spirit’
is the dead body moving about according to

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.680
them and thirdly it means also alcohol.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.730
Now which one is closer to which one, I don’t
know, but this is why I am saying that English

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.749
language is a difficult thing.

00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:33.540
Marathi is the best because lot of work has
been done among Maharashtrians on Kundalini.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.949
Nath Panthis were there.

00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:37.720
They have done lot of work.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:44.250
But the tradition was that one person would
give Realization to only one person.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:52.850
If I have done anything you think worth mentioning,
it is that I tried to find out a way of giving

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.839
collective Realization, collective happening.

00:11:55.839 --> 00:12:03.670
That’s what was My humble contribution and
by which I find thousands of people have got

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.160
their Realization.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.870
Now what is the Realization?

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:15.389
It is that if you see at the base of the spinal
chord is a triangular bone called as ‘Sacrum’.

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:22.670
It is called ‘Sacrum’ because it is a
sacred bone and the Greeks knew about it,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.589
that it’s a sacred bone.

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:32.459
And according to our Shastras and also many
other prophecies, there resides a power within

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:38.269
us, our own power, your own power called as
Kundalini.

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:44.050
Is called ‘Kundalini’ because it is in
three and a half coils.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.910
Coils are called ‘kundal’, that’s why
it is the Kundalini.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.870
Now this, this power is your own.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:13:04.009
It’s in every human being and if it is awakened,
it passes through six centers piercing through

00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:11.430
the top of the head, which we call as the
Brahmarandhra in the Sanskrit language and

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.069
the fontanel area in the English language.

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:19.819
It passes through that soft bone which was
there in the childhood and you just start

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:26.319
feeling the cool breeze coming out of your
head and the cool breeze coming on to your

00:13:26.319 --> 00:13:27.319
fingertips.

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:28.319
It happens.

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:32.470
It’s an experience and for which you cannot
pay.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.470
You cannot.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.889
I may go on telling you lots of stories this,
that, that won’t work out.

00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:38.399
It has to happen.

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:44.779
The Kundalini has to rise and has to pierce
through fontanel area otherwise, otherwise,

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:46.720
it’s no use.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.259
It’s just words, some sermon or something
like that.

00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:58.619
So this happening is very easy in this Kaliyuga.

00:13:58.619 --> 00:14:04.899
Is really remarkable because maybe because
of Kaliyug people are fed up of the things

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:09.220
going on and all kinds of things working out.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.160
Now what does it do?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.079
It passes through six center.

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:24.999
Six centers, these are meant for our physical,
mental, and emotional being and also for our

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:26.220
spiritual being.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:33.310
So when it passes through these six centers,
it nourishes those centers, it integrates

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:42.089
all these centers, and ultimately it passes
through this and enters into the all pervading

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:46.850
power of Divine love, is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:55.930
You may call it as ‘all pervading power
of Divine love’ or anything but names make

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:56.930
no difference.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:04.680
There is a very subtle power around us, which
looks after us, which guides us, which helps

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.620
us, which is the torsion area.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:17.510
Now, while doing that what happens that you
become knowledgeable of the absolute truth,

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.510
absolute!

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:25.309
Whatever you know is absolute, is nothing
to doubt, nothing can be challenged.

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:30.720
For example, it starts flowing through your
fingertips.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.209
Starts flowing through your fingertips and
you can feel it on your fingertips, your centers.

00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:41.209
Now these are five, six, and seven centers,
five, six and seven centers.

00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:43.730
I am not going to tell you all the details
now.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:55.089
But when you start feeling these whole sensation,
Adi Shankaracharya has called it as ‘spand’,

00:15:55.089 --> 00:16:01.309
then you feel the truth, the real truth.

00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:08.369
For example, supposing in your office you
get somebody who is a cheat, very well dressed,

00:16:08.369 --> 00:16:12.619
speaks English very well, you know, very well
behaved.

00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:15.449
How will you make him out?

00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:19.450
Just have to put your hands under your table
and see for yourself.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:26.720
Immediately you will get some sort of a burning
sensation or you might feel some sort of a,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.759
what do you call, needle and pins like that.

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.939
That kind of a feeling you might get.

00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:38.170
Then you will also know what centers he’s
catching on your fingertips.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.079
This is the absolute knowledge about everything.

00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:48.439
Is not question of only knowing he is a bad
or a good person, but also of diseases.

00:16:48.439 --> 00:16:53.810
Supposing you have some disease, you will
feel it on your fingertips.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.769
On your fingertips you’ll feel it.

00:16:55.769 --> 00:17:00.990
You’ll know this is your disease and if
you know how to cure them, you can cure others

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.380
also because you become one with the whole.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.540
It’s a very collective personality you develop.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.000
Who is the other, after all?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.640
We are all one.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.160
But only trouble is we are separated because
of this ignorance.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.920
Once this works out, so many things drop out
from us.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:31.270
This is the right side I am telling you about
but also the conditionings are very much working

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.270
out in us.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.010
In our reaction, there are two things that
work out.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.281
One is the right side, another the left side.

00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:43.050
And the left side is all the conditioning
as you see there.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:50.620
These conditionings come to us through our
childhood, through our family, through our

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:56.230
country, through our reading, this, that all
kinds of things, they come up.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:06.940
But also family upbringing is very important
because according to our Shaastraas, there

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.940
are six enemies.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.940
We have got six.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.560
Now these six enemies are what?

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.530
So Kama, Krodha, Mada, Matsara, Lobha, Moha.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.160
Kama is what you can call sexual urge.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.670
Krodha is anger.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.180
Krishna has denounced anger.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.150
But all right sided people are hot tempered.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.270
They don’t want to be, but they are.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.390
And when they lose their temper then they
feel bad also.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.750
Not that they want to lose it but they just
lose it.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.700
Now this one drops out.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:47.870
The temper goes out completely because you
develop that witness state saakshi swaroopa.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.340
With that witness state you just see everything.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.160
You don’t lose temper.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.990
You just see it.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.060
That is one thing drops out very well.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:02.170
Mada is false pride.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.170
That we have.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.990
I know IAS officers and their wives.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.830
They have that false pride.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.360
Not everyone, but some of them do, they have.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.000
I have very funny experiences of that.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.780
Like, once we went to Delhi to Hatriji and
they had given us a house in Mina Bagh and

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.800
I met another friend of Mine from Lucknow
who had married an IAS officer.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.540
Oh, very proud girl and she asked Me, “Where
are you living?

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.540
How are you?”

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.800
I said, “My husband is a government servant
and so he’s transferred here.”

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.040
“But where are you living?”

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.280
I said “Mina Bagh.”

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.280
“Oh my God!

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.280
Mina Bagh!

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.280
What is your husband doing?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280
Is he a clerk?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.280
What is he doing?”

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.880
I said, “He’s doing something” and I
was just looking at her the way she was on

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880
Me.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.190
“My husband might be your husband’s boss”
this and that.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.020
I said, “Maybe I don’t know anything about
these things.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.990
I am sorry, I don’t know your list of people,
anything.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.770
I am not interested.”

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.150
And then My husband came.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.930
So she said, “See that tall man.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.430
You know he’s very important.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.320
He’s with the Prime Minister.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.570
You go and talk to him and get Your husband
promoted.”

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:23.900
I said ([Laughing] What is she up to?), I
said, “Sudhali, he is My husband.”

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.900
“Heh!

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.540
He’s your husband?

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.540
Haan yaar!

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.940
Oh my God!

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.870
I am sorry I am.”

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.040
I said, “It’s all right.”

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040
Common experience.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:42.620
The women also become IAS, you see, not actually
but as wives and I’ve been such a lost person

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.680
with them.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:50.860
I could never understand what is there to
be IAS and to be his wife.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.660
It was beyond Me.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:59.200
But one thing, what really helped Me in all
this turmoil of life, because you know our

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:09.880
pay is less, this, that all problems are there,
was the patriotism Raashtra Bhakti.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.940
My father was a great patriot.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.100
My mother was.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:18.090
They sacrificed everything for the independence
of this country.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:23.520
I cannot travel by any foreign airlines, whatever
maybe.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.220
Maybe Air India is not good, doesn’t matter.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.550
It’s My, My country’s.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:35.480
So the feeling that this is My country kept
Me going.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.410
You see you become like a Kargil soldier.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.390
You are fighting for your country.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:47.320
You are working for your country.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.580
My husband got into Indian Foreign Service.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.920
I told him, “Nothing doing.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.610
We don’t drink, both of us and I can’t
leave My country in the lurch at the time

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.650
when we have got the freedom.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.100
So if you want you can go, I will not come.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.260
I don’t want to go to Foreign Service.”

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.700
They cut his pay.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.510
That time, you know, 300 was a big amount.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.130
I said, “Doesn’t matter.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.150
Whatever it is, I’ll stay in My country.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.640
I’ll work in My country and you work here.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.150
I’ll support you every way.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.830
I don’t want anything.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:25.740
Nothing I want and you don’t take a bribe
at all otherwise that day I’ll leave this.”

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:33.650
Otherwise also I said that, “The another
thing is our country has to develop.”

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.660
Who will develop?

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.210
I always felt that you are the spinal cord
of our country.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.420
You have to develop this country.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.420
What is this money?

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.420
Comes and goes.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:50.800
You’ve seen the people who have got money,
where their children have gone?

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.360
What has happened to them?

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.360
What have they achieved?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.080
So I told very frankly that I will not go
to the Foreign Service of any kind because

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.720
what is in the Foreign Service?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.760
I want to do everything in this country of
Mine for which I have also fought.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:14.150
I have fought a lot and this is what now sometimes,
you know, is disappointing to see what things

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.240
are happening.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.600
But a day will come.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.390
This country will rise.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.390
How?

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.950
Because when this happens, when this Kundalini
rising take place, when people become realized

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.470
souls, they just transform.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:35.040
They become extremely patriotic, extremely
patriotic and they understand what is needed

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.340
today for our country.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.280
They can sacrifice anything.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:48.240
They can live anywhere and they are not bothered
about some sort of a, you can call it a financial

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.070
help or other material thing.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.330
They are above materialism.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:24:01.250
There are thousands and thousands like that
even in our country, thousands and also abroad.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.080
Now Sahaja Yoga is working 86 countries.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:13.210
They are all full of joy because with this
happening you get joy of a quality which has

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.210
no double thing.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.490
It’s not happiness / unhappiness.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:22.720
It’s just joy and you have another thing
also with it, is the peace of mind.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.040
Just you are so peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.580
You don’t have to worry about things.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:37.730
You don’t have to become jittery because
see the diseases you develop.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:42.050
Apart from that, all kinds of paralysis comes
on us.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:47.420
We had a doctor in our hospital there who
was working very hard.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.050
I told him that, “Doctor, see now your age
has come.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.560
You should take it easy.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.120
Daytime you must rest.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.290
There’s no need.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:59.340
You are not in a office, just rest, take rest
do something else.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.770
Read or you can go and play.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:02.770
Do something.”

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:09.100
He wouldn’t listen to Me and then he got
paraplegia, means that failure of the hand

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.730
and the leg, completely.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.000
He couldn’t even walk.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.150
He couldn’t lift his leg.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.310
Now he’s all right, cured.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.310
But then I told him that you take treatment
for your right side.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.090
That’s very important.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:27.710
It’s very simple treatment and which can
be done very easily.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.050
For example, you can have an ice bag on the
liver.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.800
You can have ice bag here because this is
the portion.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.910
This moves like this so the portion this one
gets heated up.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:44.030
So you put ice here, you put ice.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.890
This icing business will really help you a
lot.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:55.040
But also there are some other very simple
homely treatments which you can take.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.460
But I would request all of you to come to
our center somewhere in

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.290
Mother talks aside: [Bhaaratiya?

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.660
Wahan hai na?

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.950
Bharatiya, usmein hai ki nahi?]

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.740
Where is she gone?

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.910
Somebody says, “Bhaaratiya Vidya Peeth.”

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:15.060
Shri Mataji: So you all can come there if
you live in this area.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.870
In every area, we have got centers.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.020
So you all can come into that center humbly.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:28.330
There is, you see, in Sahaja Yoga there is
nothing like any position or anything.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.980
We have to humble down.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.920
This false pride is of no use.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.090
We humble down.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:41.210
When we humble down, it’s very easy to achieve
it and to get this into yourself.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.520
After all, otherwise, what is it?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.030
What is life for?

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.750
There’s no enjoyment.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.020
There’s no experiencing of what you are
doing.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.070
So much work you put in I know, I know that.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.370
I know how you people have to work hard.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:06.230
But to get over, to get over all the strain
and stress, you must do meditation for five

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.420
minutes which they will tell you how to do
it.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.840
Five minutes in the evening will help you.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:19.420
So, just like as you take bath in the morning,
bathe yourself with the showers of this Kundalini.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.690
She’s your mother.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:29.462
She has been your mother from ages and she
has recorded everything about you within itself.

00:27:29.462 --> 00:27:35.270
This is the subtle side of you and when you
want to have your Realization, she’s very

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.490
anxious to be awakened.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.100
She’s extremely anxious and it works wonders.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.480
I am surprised that how people get Realization
in no time.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.000
The only trouble with them is, it’s like
a primule or you can call it the ‘ankuraa’,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.250
which grows but it doesn’t become a tree.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.330
So, little bit you have to meditate.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.330
You have to be collective and works out.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:04.640
In collective, you forget everything, your
position everything.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.890
I have known IAS officers who have been dancing
with the villagers, singing with the villagers,

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.080
so much they enjoy.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.930
They said, “We knew this but we never wanted
to express it, you see.”

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.550
So all this drops out.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:23.590
All these outward bondages drop out and you
become one with the collective.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.870
You know their problems.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.790
You know how to solve them and it’s very
good.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.980
I think this is what is only one has to achieve,
nothing else.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.300
If you achieve this, you’ve achieved the
last and the best.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.620
With this then you can help others.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.880
You can give Realizations to others.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.110
You can save their lives.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.840
I mean, it’s all your power that is going
to work out.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:58.170
In these days of horrible struggle and all
kinds of things happening, violence, very

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.780
much needed is this Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:07.690
And you’ll be amazed, it is something a
grace that people get it.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:12.780
In Turkey, we have about two thousand people
who are realized souls.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:20.640
Nobody lost their life, not a single thing,
not their houses were even, they just little

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:26.060
bit, I would say, shook but never fell down.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.400
The whole Orissa, it happened the same.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:36.410
It has happened in several places that people
have been just saved with those who have been

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.350
in the grace of the Divine.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.750
We have to become that.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.810
We can’t live without it.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.040
It’s rather subtle.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:50.180
It is subtle, I know but sometimes must understand
we have to be subtle.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:30:00.660
Now as it is, so much of illness, sickness
I find, mostly I find with all the people

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.960
who are working very hard is the right sided
problem.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.250
Some sort of a right side.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:13.730
And it can be absolutely cured, absolutely
be under your control, and you can cure others

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.730
also.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:20.870
This is such a blessing we have in this horrible
Kaliyuga.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:27.010
The worst times, they say, the worst and worst
that is the time is now and you see the effects

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.010
of that.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.820
But in that only, the lotus of Sahaja Yoga
has come up.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.240
You don’t have to pay for it.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.280
That’s one thing you should know.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.190
Anybody asks money from you, he’s not Divine.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.610
Don’t have to pay for it, at all.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:49.370
When you grow and when you achieve, when you
give Realizations to others, then you will

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:55.590
be surprised you rise into a new realm of
understanding which is a doubtless awareness

00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:01.670
which is called as ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’
according to Patanjali.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:07.330
Now as we have learnt English, I don’t think
we read much of the, our Indian scriptures

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.640
and thing.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:17.190
But that also, those who read will go on praying
to one monde of statues, this, that, I mean

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:24.590
just they are fanatically religious people,
wasting their life like that.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:29.840
The another side are the buddhivaadis what
you call are the intellectuals, you see.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.010
They are the much worst because they think
they have read everything.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:34.010
They know everything.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.010
Now what to tell them?

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.730
It’s a very simple thing, they don’t want
to accept.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.480
You can’t tell them, “Take it straight.”

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.680
You have to have it in the other way.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:51.920
So also to understand it, we should know we
have not known ourselves.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.880
We have to know ourselves and for knowing
ourselves, Kundalini awakening is the only

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.700
way, as far as I know.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:07.841
And I hope you all will think about it and
come to our centers where Realization can

00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:08.841
be given.

00:32:08.841 --> 00:32:11.150
There are many centers we have got.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:16.850
You don’t have to pay any money, nothing,
but you come and relax.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.910
Relaxation is only possible after Self-Realization,
not before that.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:24.850
You’ll be surprised your aging will stop.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.680
I have no aging problem.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.590
My husband also has no aging problem.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.490
We don’t think of it.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:32.490
It’s over.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.690
Now, whenever one has to die, one will die.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.900
But till then we are not bothered.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:45.670
Anything that you do will have a special light
of the Divine.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:51.880
I bless you from My heart that you develop
this subtle things within yourself and you

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.410
try to understand that so far you have not
known yourself.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.740
You have to know yourself.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.430
You don’t have to introspect and sit down
criticizing yourself, feeling guilty.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.830
No, not at all.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:08.810
Whatever has happened has happened because
you’ll be amazed at yourself that all your

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:12.500
destructive habits also will drop out by themselves.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:18.160
Overnight in London, there were twelve boys
with the addiction of drugs.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.610
They stopped over night, over night.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:24.050
I don’t, never told them.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.070
I never tell people, “Don’t, don’t.”

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.600
I never say that.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:36.010
But that Kundalini rises and the light of
the, your heart, light of the Spirit, that

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.400
guides you.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.990
That tells you what is destructive for you.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:45.150
And you have power not to accept anything
that is destructive.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.030
I know there are difficulties.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:50.870
I know there are problems but you’ll never
see them.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:55.590
If you are sitting in a boat, you are not
be bothered as to how deep the sea is.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.810
It’s like that.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:02.030
You rise above all these things and you watch
and you help others.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.720
Apart from that, it helps you in your work,
very much in your work.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.750
You understand your work very well because
of torsion area again.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.909
My husband says, “How do You get this idea?”

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.069
I say, “I got it.

00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:18.940
All right this is the idea, I’ve got it.”

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.819
Now he’s amazed sometimes how I manage things.

00:34:21.819 --> 00:34:22.819
How I am doing?

00:34:22.819 --> 00:34:24.159
I have no secretariat.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.749
I have no secretary.

00:34:25.749 --> 00:34:28.220
I have no P.A., nothing.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.009
And we are working in 86 countries.

00:34:31.009 --> 00:34:38.740
So it is just works out because it is this
Divine power which is so helpful or which

00:34:38.740 --> 00:35:51.950
is so kind.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:36:40.849
So again and again, I wish you best of luck.

00:36:40.849 --> 00:37:40.680
Please come to our centers.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:39:02.740
I hope they’ll give you the addresses and
all that and you

00:39:02.740 --> 00:40:05.599
can come on Saturdays or Sundays, whenever
you

00:40:05.599 --> 00:41:41.640
want to and

00:41:41.640 --> 00:42:20.150
get

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:25.140
your Realization.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:43.930
May God bless you!

00:42:43.930 --> 00:43:50.609
Somebody says, “Shri Mataji, they

00:43:50.609 --> 00:47:32.289
are requesting, if

00:47:32.289 --> 01:04:20.490
you can give them Self Realization here?”
