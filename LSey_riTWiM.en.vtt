00:14.111 --> 00:23.455
Today we are celebrating here a special
day called Makar Sankrant.

00:23.656 --> 00:31.170
For the information of the foreign Sahaja
Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.

00:31.371 --> 00:36.618
[Shri Mataji explains that She will speak
first in English then in Marathi].

00:37.357 --> 00:42.152
It means the day - today is the day the sun

00:42.353 --> 00:55.056
crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

00:55.740 --> 01:01.862
It’s a very big day for us because, now

01:02.044 --> 01:08.305
during the summertime we have the harvest,
and we look forward to the rain

01:08.506 --> 01:13.138
and so many things that happen in every
country.

01:13.339 --> 01:22.439
The sun falls at right angles in this
country during the summer season,

01:22.640 --> 01:25.243
and so we welcome the sun.

01:25.444 --> 01:29.876
We eat something that you must have
eaten already,

01:30.077 --> 01:34.464
what we call as til and jaggery.

01:34.664 --> 01:38.742
It is to prepare your body and your mind

01:38.943 --> 01:42.532
to give it sufficient heat to receive
the sun.

01:42.733 --> 01:47.471
Because if you are living in the cold
season,

01:47.672 --> 01:55.630
then all your body, mind becomes lethargic,

01:55.830 --> 02:02.468
and you become also sometimes very lazy
about things,

02:02.671 --> 02:06.571
in the sense that the day is so small

02:06.780 --> 02:11.569
that you cannot achieve many results.

02:11.886 --> 02:17.060
So the body has become cold as we call it.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.226
We take these things, which give us heat,

02:20.427 --> 02:25.168
so body is prepared to receive the heat
of the sun to welcome it.

02:25.369 --> 02:33.878
To overcome the inertia set in by the cold
weather,

02:34.079 --> 02:42.036
and also to invigorate the body’s strength,
tune to the sun,

02:42.237 --> 02:48.978
people take to all these ways of greeting
you,

02:49.179 --> 02:55.140
by which they give you something that
is heat-creating in the body.

02:56.195 --> 03:01.865
But it has another very subtle expression,
which I find is this:

03:02.066 --> 03:05.990
that when they give you this, they say,
“Now you take til and gul

03:06.191 --> 03:11.164
and you say things which are sweet.”

03:11.399 --> 03:13.524
Because when you are taking til and gul,

03:13.725 --> 03:18.470
your body gets heated up, and you become
right-sided person.

03:18.671 --> 03:23.610
When you become right-sided person
you seldom speak sweetly.

03:23.811 --> 03:28.923
So it is a contrast that they give you
a thing to heat you up

03:29.124 --> 03:35.117
so that your body gets heated up, but
you must speak sweetly.

03:35.318 --> 03:40.107
(…) That’s why they say today is the day
when we start speaking very sweetly.

03:40.308 --> 03:44.175
Even if there is some enemy or somebody
who is not friendly with you,

03:44.376 --> 03:48.738
or there has been some misunderstanding,
this is the day we say that

03:48.939 --> 03:53.601
“All right, take this and say something
very sweet.

03:53.802 --> 03:56.426
Talk sweetly to each other.”

03:56.641 --> 03:59.774
(…) Now the sun is so much respected
in this country

03:59.975 --> 04:06.561
that in early morning time all the people
get up and say Namaskars to Surya

04:06.762 --> 04:10.517
with all His names and do a particular
type of exercise

04:10.718 --> 04:17.032
to show that they are completely
surrendered to the will of the Surya.

04:17.233 --> 04:22.163
When you do that, then the ego doesn’t
come in.

04:22.550 --> 04:27.711
Now the sun, when He shines here, it gives
you a feeling

04:27.928 --> 04:32.256
that you have to be active, you have
to work very hard.

04:32.457 --> 04:36.362
As a result of that, you might develop ego.

04:36.563 --> 04:42.694
But when you develop ego, then it surrounds
your brain completely,

04:42.895 --> 04:48.165
and when the brain is surrounded with ego,
you do not know which way to go.

04:48.366 --> 04:51.919
You do not know what is right, what
is wrong.

04:52.120 --> 04:56.083
You do not have any discretion and
no direction.

04:56.284 --> 05:00.070
You do what you please, whatever
pleases ego.

05:00.270 --> 05:03.459
And this is a day when we celebrate it
in a way

05:03.660 --> 05:07.044
to surrender ourselves to the Surya,
to the sun,

05:07.244 --> 05:13.931
which is, as you know, is the residence
of Shri Lord Jesus Christ.

05:14.132 --> 05:16.696
He resides on the sun.

05:16.897 --> 05:22.491
So how humble He was, how humble He was
residing on the sun.

05:22.692 --> 05:27.822
The more you live on the sun, there should
be much more humility.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.757
Of course, I must say in India people
are humbler.

05:30.958 --> 05:37.493
But still, the quality of sun can make you
extremely arrogant

05:37.694 --> 05:43.056
and very unpleasant person. This
unpleasant person

05:43.257 --> 05:46.721
can really ruin all kinds of good
relations.

05:46.922 --> 05:53.294
But the worst thing that happens to us
is that we lose our integration.

05:53.495 --> 05:56.030
Because when we say harsh things to anyone,

05:56.242 --> 05:59.235
we feel guilty, so we have another problem,

05:59.436 --> 06:03.728
our heart feels bad, our liver feels bad,
everything is upset.

06:03.929 --> 06:07.515
And thus we feel absolutely disintegrated.

06:07.716 --> 06:14.585
And disintegrated is a sign of our not
evolving at all

06:14.785 --> 06:19.147
or we should say devolving.

06:19.714 --> 06:24.700
Disintegration is such a common thing
that we see -

06:24.901 --> 06:32.645
in ourselves we see that we fight with
our ego.

06:32.846 --> 06:35.462
Then we fight with our superego,

06:35.663 --> 06:39.407
then we fight with our heart, with our
emotions,

06:39.608 --> 06:44.102
and all the time we are fighting within
ourselves.

06:44.303 --> 06:49.401
So at least within ourselves we should
speak sweetly on this day.

06:49.602 --> 06:54.167
Then we can start speaking to others very,
very sweetly.

06:54.368 --> 07:00.072
Now some people think, to speak sweetly
is a sign of weakness.

07:00.273 --> 07:03.710
In some countries people believe that
if you speak to someone

07:03.921 --> 07:06.493
sweetly it is a sign of weakness.

07:06.694 --> 07:10.027
It is the greatest strength of a Sahaja
Yogi

07:10.227 --> 07:13.962
to speak to others with respect,

07:14.163 --> 07:19.819
with proper protocol, and with proper
understanding.

07:20.452 --> 07:23.866
Now because of arrogance, people also
forget

07:24.067 --> 07:26.314
what is their situation is,

07:26.515 --> 07:35.720
and this indiscreet temperament gives
you no sense of direction.

07:35.921 --> 07:39.907
You move in every direction and you don’t
know where you are going.

07:40.108 --> 07:43.931
As long as your ego is satisfied, you go
ahead with it,

07:44.132 --> 07:48.673
and by the time you discover that you have
really become a Humpty Dumpty,

07:48.874 --> 07:53.149
you do not know what you have done
to yourself.

07:53.350 --> 07:59.790
So the best way to conquer your ego is
to speak sweetly, first of all.

07:59.991 --> 08:03.610
It’s such a small thing to be done,
but it brings you

08:03.811 --> 08:10.702
to that synthesis of character within
yourself, first of all,

08:10.903 --> 08:17.320
and to the synthesis of all the beautiful
principles of lives.

08:17.521 --> 08:20.648
Like you talk to somebody sweetly,

08:20.849 --> 08:24.863
the person may like you. He may tell you
something,

08:25.064 --> 08:30.516
which he may be knowing of a very great
importance for you.

08:30.717 --> 08:38.485
If you talk to somebody sweetly, then
you may get the peace of mind

08:38.686 --> 08:42.115
because you have given peace to another
person.

08:42.316 --> 08:45.548
Whatever you give to another person,
that you feel within yourself.

08:45.749 --> 08:48.186
But if you are quarreling with another
person,

08:48.387 --> 08:52.856
actually, it is the reflection of your
quarrelling nature within yourself.

08:53.057 --> 08:56.061
Today there is a big dearth, and big cry

08:56.288 --> 09:00.571
and big organizations working out the peace
missions.

09:00.772 --> 09:03.964
The peace mission is within yourself.

09:04.165 --> 09:08.627
Let us start all of us the Sahaja Yogis who
are great saints sitting here,

09:08.828 --> 09:13.212
decide today that we are going to make
peace with ourselves and with others.

09:13.413 --> 09:17.454
(…) Let everybody live peacefully within
themselves

09:17.655 --> 09:21.618
and give peace to others, so that this
peace

09:21.819 --> 09:26.449
will become a nucleus for the peace
of the world.

09:26.650 --> 09:36.993
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

09:37.194 --> 09:40.670
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

09:40.871 --> 09:44.620
You are sitting in complete peace and
happiness and joy,

09:44.821 --> 09:47.087
you don’t know, you are emitting all that
peace,

09:47.288 --> 09:52.587
channelizing it and doing it. But still,
there are some

09:52.788 --> 09:57.259
there are some who are suffering from
horrible ego, and with hurt ego;

09:57.460 --> 10:00.390
and they are trying to do something,
which they should never do,

10:00.591 --> 10:03.673
is to think just now.

10:03.874 --> 10:07.806
If you are thinking just now, you will not
register what I am saying

10:08.007 --> 10:10.536
because this is another quality of a person

10:10.737 --> 10:14.054
who is ego oriented is not to register.

10:14.255 --> 10:16.566
You may say anything you like but they
don’t hear.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.861
They hear what they want to hear or they
don’t hear.

10:20.061 --> 10:23.827
So this is another thing we have to today
decide,

10:24.028 --> 10:30.548
that we’ll register things than to tell
off. Let us register.

10:30.749 --> 10:35.126
This is a sign of a character that wants
to know;

10:35.327 --> 10:37.842
wants to know more about.

10:38.043 --> 10:44.468
The criteria of ascent is synthesis and
integration.

10:44.700 --> 10:48.939
A person who is not integrated with other
Sahaja Yogi

10:49.155 --> 10:52.277
is not a man who has ascended.

10:52.875 --> 11:02.120
(…) Peace is a nature or is the quality
of your Spirit.

11:02.321 --> 11:07.442
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

11:07.643 --> 11:15.460
what happens that you go beyond the cause
and the effect.

11:15.661 --> 11:18.423
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

11:18.639 --> 11:23.444
So the cause disappears, and the effect
also disappears.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.267
So today we all have come here

11:26.468 --> 11:30.211
to worship the peace, the within and
the without.

11:30.947 --> 11:34.853
(...) So today is the day I should also
not say anything

11:35.054 --> 11:39.699
that is in any way hurting to anyone

11:39.923 --> 11:45.694
and I am trying to make you smile and
laugh but you are so serious.

11:47.686 --> 11:50.689
So today we decide on peace.

11:50.890 --> 11:53.619
Peace with ourselves, peace with others,

11:53.820 --> 11:56.532
and that is how we worship the sun,

11:56.733 --> 11:59.427
Christ, the one who was the emblem,

11:59.628 --> 12:08.202
who was the absolute practical symbol
of that peace.

12:08.565 --> 12:12.267
And once you understand this, I am sure
you will try

12:12.468 --> 12:17.274
to follow that, instead of hitting
everybody,

12:17.475 --> 12:21.196
getting angry with everybody. Just forget
all this.

12:21.397 --> 12:26.059
You have come here to ascend,
and your gain is your gain.

12:26.260 --> 12:29.362
Your fighting is not your gain, remember
that.

12:29.563 --> 12:31.517
Your quarrelling is not your gain.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.383
The gain is the peace that you have
achieved,

12:34.584 --> 12:39.132
the love that you have developed,
the compassion that you can emit,

12:39.333 --> 12:43.901
the amount of relationship and the rapport
you can penetrate into others.

12:44.102 --> 12:47.786
This is your gain which we have to receive
today:

12:47.987 --> 12:54.366
a mind, a heart like a lion, and not
chicken-hearted people.

12:54.567 --> 13:00.284
Not people who would be angry and this,
to boast of your anger:

13:00.485 --> 13:02.634
these days are gone, we boast of our peace,

13:02.834 --> 13:07.235
we boast of our contentment, we boast
of our glory

13:07.436 --> 13:12.499
and we boast of our state.

13:12.809 --> 13:17.179
And that is the state where we are now
in the Kingdom of God.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.218
May God bless you all.
