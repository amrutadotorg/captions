00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:23.455
Today we are celebrating here a special
day called Makar Sankrant.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:31.170
For the information of the foreign Sahaja
Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:36.618
[Shri Mataji explains that She will speak
first in English then in Marathi].

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:42.152
It means the day - today is the day the sun

00:00:42.353 --> 00:00:55.056
crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.862
It’s a very big day for us because, now

00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:08.305
during the summertime we have the harvest,
and we look forward to the rain

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:13.138
and so many things that happen in every
country.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:22.439
The sun falls at right angles in this
country during the summer season,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.243
and so we welcome the sun.

00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:29.876
We eat something that you must have
eaten already,

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:34.464
what we call as til and jaggery.

00:01:34.664 --> 00:01:38.742
It is to prepare your body and your mind

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:42.532
to give it sufficient heat to receive
the sun.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:47.471
Because if you are living in the cold
season,

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:55.630
then all your body, mind becomes lethargic,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.468
and you become also sometimes very lazy
about things,

00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:06.571
in the sense that the day is so small

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.569
 that you cannot achieve many results.

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:17.060
So the body has become cold as we call it.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.226
We take these things, which give us heat,

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:25.168
so body is prepared to receive the heat
of the sun to welcome it.

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:33.878
To overcome the inertia set in by the cold
weather,

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:42.036
and also to invigorate the body’s strength,
tune to the sun,

00:02:42.237 --> 00:02:48.978
people take to all these ways of greeting
you,

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:55.140
by which they give you something that
is heat-creating in the body.

00:02:56.195 --> 00:03:01.865
But it has another very subtle expression,
which I find is this:

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:05.990
that when they give you this, they say,
“Now you take til and gul

00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:11.164
and you say things which are sweet.”

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.524
Because when you are taking til and gul,

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:18.470
your body gets heated up, and you become
right-sided person.

00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.610
When you become right-sided person
you seldom speak sweetly.

00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:28.923
So it is a contrast that they give you
a thing to heat you up

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:35.117
so that your body gets heated up, but
you must speak sweetly.

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:40.107
(…) That’s why they say today is the day
when we start speaking very sweetly.

00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:44.175
Even if there is some enemy or somebody
who is not friendly with you,

00:03:44.376 --> 00:03:48.738
or there has been some misunderstanding,
this is the day we say that

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.601
“All right, take this and say something
very sweet.

00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:56.426
Talk sweetly to each other.”

00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:59.774
(…) Now the sun is so much respected
in this country

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:06.561
that in early morning time all the people
get up and say Namaskars to Surya

00:04:06.762 --> 00:04:10.517
with all His names and do a particular
type of exercise

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:17.032
to show that they are completely
surrendered to the will of the Surya.

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:22.163
When you do that, then the ego doesn’t
come in.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.711
Now the sun, when He shines here, it gives
you a feeling

00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:32.256
that you have to be active, you have
to work very hard.

00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:36.362
As a result of that, you might develop ego.

00:04:36.563 --> 00:04:42.694
But when you develop ego, then it surrounds
your brain completely,

00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:48.165
and when the brain is surrounded with ego,
you do not know which way to go.

00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:51.919
You do not know what is right, what
is wrong.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.083
You do not have any discretion and
no direction.

00:04:56.284 --> 00:05:00.070
You do what you please, whatever
pleases ego.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.459
And this is a day when we celebrate it
in a way

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.044
to surrender ourselves to the Surya,
to the sun,

00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:13.931
which is, as you know, is the residence
of Shri Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:14.132 --> 00:05:16.696
He resides on the sun.

00:05:16.897 --> 00:05:22.491
So how humble He was, how humble He was
residing on the sun.

00:05:22.692 --> 00:05:27.822
The more you live on the sun, there should 
be much more humility.

00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:30.757
Of course, I must say in India people
are humbler.

00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:37.493
But still, the quality of sun can make you
extremely arrogant

00:05:37.694 --> 00:05:43.056
and very unpleasant person. This
unpleasant person

00:05:43.257 --> 00:05:46.721
can really ruin all kinds of good
relations.

00:05:46.922 --> 00:05:53.294
But the worst thing that happens to us
is that we lose our integration.

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:56.030
Because when we say harsh things to anyone,

00:05:56.242 --> 00:05:59.235
we feel guilty, so we have another problem,

00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:03.728
our heart feels bad, our liver feels bad,
everything is upset.

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:07.515
And thus we feel absolutely disintegrated.

00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:14.585
And disintegrated is a sign of our not
evolving at all

00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:19.147
or we should say devolving.

00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:24.700
Disintegration is such a common thing
that we see -

00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:32.645
in ourselves we see that we fight with
our ego.

00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:35.462
Then we fight with our superego,

00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:39.407
then we fight with our heart, with our
emotions,

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:44.102
and all the time we are fighting within
ourselves.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:49.401
So at least within ourselves we should
speak sweetly on this day.

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:54.167
Then we can start speaking to others very,
very sweetly.

00:06:54.368 --> 00:07:00.072
Now some people think, to speak sweetly
is a sign of weakness.

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:03.710
In some countries people believe that
if you speak to someone

00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:06.493
sweetly it is a sign of weakness.

00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:10.027
It is the greatest strength of a Sahaja
Yogi

00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:13.962
to speak to others with respect,

00:07:14.163 --> 00:07:19.819
with proper protocol, and with proper
understanding.

00:07:20.452 --> 00:07:23.866
Now because of arrogance, people also
forget

00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:26.314
what is their situation is,

00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:35.720
and this indiscreet temperament gives
you no sense of direction.

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:39.907
You move in every direction and you don’t
know where you are going.

00:07:40.108 --> 00:07:43.931
As long as your ego is satisfied, you go
ahead with it,

00:07:44.132 --> 00:07:48.673
and by the time you discover that you have
really become a Humpty Dumpty,

00:07:48.874 --> 00:07:53.149
you do not know what you have done
to yourself.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:59.790
So the best way to conquer your ego is
to speak sweetly, first of all.

00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:03.610
It’s such a small thing to be done,
but it brings you

00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:10.702
to that synthesis of character within
yourself, first of all,

00:08:10.903 --> 00:08:17.320
and to the synthesis of all the beautiful
principles of lives.

00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:20.648
Like you talk to somebody sweetly,

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:24.863
the person may like you. He may tell you
something,

00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:30.516
which he may be knowing of a very great
importance for you.

00:08:30.717 --> 00:08:38.485
If you talk to somebody sweetly, then
you may get the peace of mind

00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:42.115
because you have given peace to another
person.

00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:45.548
Whatever you give to another person,
that you feel within yourself.

00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:48.186
But if you are quarreling with another
person,

00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:52.856
actually, it is the reflection of your
quarrelling nature within yourself.

00:08:53.057 --> 00:08:56.061
Today there is a big dearth, and big cry

00:08:56.288 --> 00:09:00.571
and big organizations working out the peace
missions.

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:03.964
The peace mission is within yourself.

00:09:04.165 --> 00:09:08.627
Let us start all of us the Sahaja Yogis who
are great saints sitting here,

00:09:08.828 --> 00:09:13.212
decide today that we are going to make
peace with ourselves and with others.

00:09:13.413 --> 00:09:17.454
(…) Let everybody live peacefully within
themselves

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:21.618
and give peace to others, so that this
peace

00:09:21.819 --> 00:09:26.449
will become a nucleus for the peace
of the world.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:36.993
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

00:09:37.194 --> 00:09:40.670
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:44.620
You are sitting in complete peace and
happiness and joy,

00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.087
you don’t know, you are emitting all that
peace,

00:09:47.288 --> 00:09:52.587
channelizing it and doing it. But still,
there are some

00:09:52.788 --> 00:09:57.259
there are some who are suffering from
horrible ego, and with hurt ego;

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.390
and they are trying to do something,
which they should never do,

00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:03.673
is to think just now.

00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:07.806
If you are thinking just now, you will not
register what I am saying

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.536
because this is another quality of a person

00:10:10.737 --> 00:10:14.054
who is ego oriented is not to register.

00:10:14.255 --> 00:10:16.566
You may say anything you like but they
don’t hear.

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:19.861
They hear what they want to hear or they
don’t hear.

00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:23.827
So this is another thing we have to today
decide,

00:10:24.028 --> 00:10:30.548
that we’ll register things than to tell
off. Let us register.

00:10:30.749 --> 00:10:35.126
This is a sign of a character that wants
to know;

00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:37.842
wants to know more about.

00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:44.468
The criteria of ascent is synthesis and
integration.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.939
A person who is not integrated with other
Sahaja Yogi

00:10:49.155 --> 00:10:52.277
is not a man who has ascended.

00:10:52.875 --> 00:11:02.120
(…) Peace is a nature or is the quality
of your Spirit.

00:11:02.321 --> 00:11:07.442
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

00:11:07.643 --> 00:11:15.460
what happens that you go beyond the cause
and the effect.

00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:18.423
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:23.444
So the cause disappears, and the effect
also disappears.

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:26.267
So today we all have come here

00:11:26.468 --> 00:11:30.211
to worship the peace, the within and
the without.

00:11:30.947 --> 00:11:34.853
(...) So today is the day I should also
not say anything

00:11:35.054 --> 00:11:39.699
that is in any way hurting to anyone

00:11:39.923 --> 00:11:45.694
and I am trying to make you smile and
laugh but you are so serious.

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:50.689
So today we decide on peace.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.619
Peace with ourselves, peace with others,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.532
and that is how we worship the sun,

00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:59.427
Christ, the one who was the emblem,

00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:08.202
who was the absolute practical symbol
of that peace.

00:12:08.565 --> 00:12:12.267
And once you understand this, I am sure
you will try

00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:17.274
to follow that, instead of hitting
everybody,

00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:21.196
getting angry with everybody. Just forget
all this.

00:12:21.397 --> 00:12:26.059
You have come here to ascend,
and your gain is your gain.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.362
Your fighting is not your gain, remember 
that.

00:12:29.563 --> 00:12:31.517
Your quarrelling is not your gain.

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:34.383
The gain is the peace that you have
achieved,

00:12:34.584 --> 00:12:39.132
the love that you have developed,
the compassion that you can emit,

00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:43.901
the amount of relationship and the rapport
you can penetrate into others.

00:12:44.102 --> 00:12:47.786
This is your gain which we have to receive
today:

00:12:47.987 --> 00:12:54.366
a mind, a heart like a lion, and not
chicken-hearted people.

00:12:54.567 --> 00:13:00.284
Not people who would be angry and this,
to boast of your anger:

00:13:00.485 --> 00:13:02.634
these days are gone, we boast of our peace,

00:13:02.834 --> 00:13:07.235
we boast of our contentment, we boast
of our glory

00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:12.499
and we boast of our state.

00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:17.179
And that is the state where we are now
in the Kingdom of God.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.218
May God bless you all.
