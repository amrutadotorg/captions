00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:10.208
Today we have gathered here

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:15.417
to do the Devi Puja.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:25.333
This Puja was performed many a times

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:33.208
and the Devi was requested

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.709
by the Devas to save them

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:48.250
from the  tyranny of devilish people.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:56.667
Today I feel the same way,

00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:02.291
that we are now in the grip

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:09.500
of a funny situation; that

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:18.208
there are people who are themselves devils, I think,

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.083
--  and also (people who are) mesmerised by them --

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:33.208
who are trying to do something which they should never have done.

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:44.000
But they don't know that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.583
there is a climax of everything.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.542
And that point has arrived

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:59.583
where all the good people,

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.125
especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:12.333
to the destruction of these horrible

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.542
personalities like Mahishasura.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.208
In those days, it was very simple

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:31.500
because devils came as devils

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:37.458
and you could see them, that they are devils,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:44.125
and all their behaviour proved that they were devils.

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:49.333
Why they did it?  Why were they cruel?

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:56.083
Because so called 'human beings' as they are

00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:02.208
-- they are not -- they are by nature devilish

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:08.417
and they want to do something by which they can destroy

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.041
human beings, and good human beings.

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:23.291
It is evident that the time has come

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:27.250
for them to be destroyed.

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:36.500
In no way I could be against Islam

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:41.250
and ever to criticise Mohammed Saab.

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:48.208
He was divine, no doubt, and tried to do divine work.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:55.041
But out of that divine work these stupid people have come up

00:03:56.583 --> 00:04:01.375
who accept those devilish people.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.166
You will be amazed to know that in Islam

00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:17.333
there are seventy-four groups!

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:26.125
They say "We follow one religion" -- but they do not.

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:31.667
Out of these,

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:37.583
some of them are really evil people,

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:44.083
and they call themselves

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:49.000
by the name as Devbandhis because this is a place in India,

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:53.333
and also they are called as Wahabees.

00:04:56.083 --> 00:05:00.041
I have been knowing them since long

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:06.125
because in our household, in my father's household,

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:11.542
we had lots of Muslim people working as cooks,

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:17.166
as drivers, as other servants.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:22.083
And these Wahabees are very interesting people

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:26.458
because they don't believe even in Mohammed Saab.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:29.375
So if you tell them

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:32.458
that Mohammed Saab has said such-and-such a thing,

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:35.166
they say "No, we don't believe in Mohammed Saab".

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:39.375
"So, in whom do you believe?"  "We believe in Allah!"

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.125
"Have you met Allah?  Have you seen him,

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:45.667
that you are believing in Him?"

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.375
But in their whole behaviour

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:55.166
it was cruelty which was innately built,

00:05:56.625 --> 00:06:02.375
very cruel; and whenever my father saw that,

00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:05.625
he asked them to get out.

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:11.333
Because (they) always had sinister

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:18.041
practices by which they used to treat others.

00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:24.667
I never knew that it will come up to that stage.

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:30.208
And they are mostly they were from Afghanistan,

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:34.166
can you imagine, mostly.

00:06:34.417 --> 00:06:38.625
Of course they tortured other Afghanis also;

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.125
and where-ever they went

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:47.583
they had a speciality that they could be very cruel.

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:55.125
Not all Afghanis, no, not at all, but some of them.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:07:00.041
And they came to India from Afghanistan

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:05.041
and we have different types of Afghanis.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.458
Some were very loving, kind, helpful, very nice people.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:16.667
And some of them were very cruel.

00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:20.583
First we didn't understand what is this.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.250
But because my father was a scholar and scholar of Islam,

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:35.375
he told us "These are not Islamic. They call themselves Wahabees

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.709
and they are not Islamic".  I can see that today, so clearly.

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:50.250
Not that in other

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:57.709
religions or in other groups there are not bad people.

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:04.291
But these Wahabees were

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:08.625
secretly working out different groups.

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:16.291
They are not many.  And that's what my father had told me

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:21.041
"One day they will become very explosive

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:27.667
and they might try to completely ruin the world".

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:31.166
At first I couldn't understand,

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:35.375
because, after all, they looked like human beings only.

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:40.500
But he says, he told me,

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:44.208
"They are absolutely camouflaged,

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:50.208
and once they start their cruelty

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:53.542
you will not know what to do."

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.500
We had one invader in our country

00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:02.041
called as Mohammed Shah Dali

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.583
He was a very, very cruel man, very cruel,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.291
and he used to even kill the Muslims

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:16.000
because his concept was

00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:20.250
that you should not worship Mohammed Saab

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:28.291
because Mohammed Saab said that "I am not Divine".

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:33.333
I also used to say the same, to save from the stupid people.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.625
For years I used to say "I am not Divine",

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:42.667
but when they felt My vibrations and all that, they believed.

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:47.125
But those who believed in Mohammed Saab

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:51.291
were never understood by these people.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:55.500
Very, very cruel,

00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:59.667
and because they don't even believe in Mohammed Saab

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:05.625
you cannot argue with them on any point; you cannot argue with them

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:09.041
what is written in the Koran

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.333
because you don't believe in Koran,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.583
you don't believe in Mohammed Saab you believe in Allah.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.500
God knows from where do they have connections!

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.542
But gradually it was surprising that

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.417
they could mesmerise --as we have

00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:32.208
horrible gurus who come as gurus and they mesmerise.

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:37.583
You have seen them, people being mesmerised.

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:42.333
So many are being exposed and so many are going to be exposed.

00:10:43.667 --> 00:10:48.333
But mostly they were people

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:51.333
who were interested in money,

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:57.542
in getting lots of money, somehow, in the name of religion.

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:06.667
But at that time, people didn't see their cruel methods

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.458
and their cruelties.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:14.583
This cruelty started growing

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:19.375
and you know we have been to Nizamudhin aulia.

00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:25.333
In that place only I discovered there's a Madharsa --

00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:28.250
'Madharsa' means a 'school'.

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:34.375
And in that school they used to admit small children.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:41.667
And it was so well planned that God doesn't know --

00:11:42.417 --> 00:11:44.417
I mean I can't say,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.667
that there were 120 Madharsas only in Delhi!

00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:55.458
Now nobody knew what they are teaching there,

00:11:56.709 --> 00:12:01.417
what they are mesmerising, how they are doing this.

00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:08.458
It so happened once I went to

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:14.041
this place, Nizamudhin,

00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:19.583
and there I found people singing songs and all that.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:27.667
And I found in them a real feeling for love.

00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:31.291
They felt My love, very much, all of them,

00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:34.375
and they started coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:39.291
But I didn't know there was a Madharsa in that place.

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:46.000
I asked them "Why is it, here the vibrations,

00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:49.250
Nizamudhin was an aulia (saint).

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:54.208
And how is that the place doesn't have good vibrations?"

00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:58.291
In between I used to get very bad vibrations.

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:02.709
So they told me "Mother, there is a Madharsa".

00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:06.542
Now look at the evil, how it works.

00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:13.417
Normally, evil used to work like this, that it would go and

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.583
form some groups, some wars, and kill people.

00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:37.208
They were few people, but they had

00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:41.542
cruelty as their religion.

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:49.625
Which ever way they lived, they wanted to be cruel.

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:57.375
In those Madharsas only, they had people who used to

00:13:58.083 --> 00:14:00.709
tell them how to be cruel, how to hate.

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:05.667
So 'education in hatred' started.

00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:11.583
And that education of hatred

00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:17.542
was very well woven through these Madharsas,

00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:20.709
all over the world.

00:14:23.709 --> 00:14:27.375
Now, as you know,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.417
Pakistan and India were always fighting.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:40.542
But this time Pakistanis realised

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:45.166
that 'If we fight with India in that way

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.166
we will be called as terrorists'.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:56.208
So they said "No, we will have no terrorism in our country".

00:14:57.542 --> 00:15:01.166
But they are the ones stupidly --this new fellow

00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:07.625
had sent about 65 scholars, ambassadors,

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:14.500
to Afghanistan to study in those Madharsas,

00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:18.667
how to become cruel  can you imagine!

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.291
To teach hatred!

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:30.583
Of course there are many Muslims who are not;

00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:38.166
but if you do not respect Mohammed Saab

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:42.083
and you are supposed to be a Muslim,

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.667
what will come out of you?

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:51.125
So, all these wrong ideas grew up

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:58.458
and Islam got divided

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.709
into many groups.

00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:07.125
It's alright, but to have this kind of a group

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:10.458
that is against all humanity

00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:15.083
was the most dangerous plan!

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:21.250
I don't know how many Muslims also knew about it.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:31.458
They spread this Madharsa thing all over the world

00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:38.417
and people coming out of that institution

00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:43.041
became very, very cruel people.

00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:48.333
The first cruelty was to the women.

00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:53.291
Women were treated with such contempt,

00:16:55.208 --> 00:17:00.667
and absolutely no respect of any kind

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.500
was given to them.

00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:12.458
This itself shows that there was no-one to control them.

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:21.333
It's not written in Koran, it's not described by Mohammed Saab.

00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:28.166
He says "God is merciful;

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.458
He is peace-giving".

00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:41.458
Whatever he did was absolutely divine, no doubt.

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:48.500
But some of these people, the way they took to satanic forces,

00:17:52.208 --> 00:17:58.458
people started misunderstanding Islam.

00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:02.166
'Islam' means 'to surrender'.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.583
Those who are surrendered are you people.

00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:13.000
Surrendered means those who have given up

00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:17.458
all their lust, greed and all these enemies,

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:24.625
and are above normal people.

00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:29.375
Another thing, it was very interesting

00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:32.500
to note that Mohammed Saab had said

00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:38.166
that "At the time of resurrection, you hands would

00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:45.458
speak". That he clearly said.

00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:50.500
Naturally, because it was written

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:56.583
in a language which was all poetic,

00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:02.542
people can, if they want to, they can twist it.

00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:11.500
But Mohammed Saab never, never could have said

00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:24.125
It's very, very shocking that in these modern times

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:33.542
that people have taken to such

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:39.208
crooked ideas.

00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:48.333
But for that, the reason is that

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.208
people also develop resistance for them.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.500
Jews -- they developed a resistance for them.

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:13.041
This hatred is responsible,

00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:18.083
and this hatred between both the sides,

00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:25.041
I would say now, is that two different ...

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:31.583
it's very evident.

00:20:37.041 --> 00:20:41.542
Now, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:47.709
you believe in complete

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:55.041
innocent, simple existence together.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:05.166
And that people believe

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:12.500
that there is definitely different groups of people. ......

00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:27.458
Now what is our duty?  What are we supposed to do?

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:34.250
First of all, we have to introspect.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.041
Supposing you are a Hindu, born,

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:44.500
you should sit down and find out if you hate

00:21:44.709 --> 00:21:47.333
anybody because he's a Muslim.

00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:50.709
You can't hate!

00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:55.208
Because somebody is a Muslim, you can't hate him.

00:21:56.291 --> 00:22:00.375
Because you are a Muslim, because you are surrendered,

00:22:02.709 --> 00:22:06.583
so how can you hate anyone?

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:18.166
If you are surrendered, you are surrendered to the Divine,

00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:23.709
and how can you then be against the Divine?

00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:30.291
So these misleading thoughts

00:22:31.542 --> 00:22:34.625
and ideas should be given up.

00:22:43.667 --> 00:22:47.125
Supposing you are a Hindu --

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.375
so you have no business to hate anyone!

00:22:58.166 --> 00:23:00.333
That is for definite!

00:23:00.542 --> 00:23:04.625
Now the word 'Hindu' also comes from the River Sindhu

00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:11.583
because Alexander couldn't say 'Sindhu' so he said 'Hindu'.

00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:18.625
And on that point many people have built

00:23:19.417 --> 00:23:27.291
this horrible hatred in India.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:34.375
But cruelty was not their theme.

00:23:36.709 --> 00:23:44.417
That was the saving point.  That they didn't want to torture people.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.625
So this aptitude to torture or to hate people

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:58.166
is coming form other sources.

00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:02.000
And the source is,

00:24:05.041 --> 00:24:10.709
as you can see clearly, that they openly hate.

00:24:13.458 --> 00:24:16.583
To hate is a very bad quality.

00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:21.250
One of the most dangerous things is to hate.

00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:25.333
And so you all must know ......

00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:37.625
alright. Now we are having a ...

00:24:59.083 --> 00:25:03.417
To me, it is very painful

00:25:05.125 --> 00:25:09.208
to think that we human beings,

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.583
(that) we hate others,

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:20.375
when you know that love is such an overwhelming,

00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:24.667
beautiful feeling.

00:25:27.667 --> 00:25:32.583
But why then do you take to hatred?

00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:42.417
Because people have

00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:49.000
impressed you, they have told you lies,

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.500
that's why you hate.  What an achievement!

00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:00.625
First to be a human being, and then to be a person full of hatred!

00:26:02.542 --> 00:26:05.417
Now what will be the next, I don't know!

00:26:08.208 --> 00:26:12.166
It was alright in those days for the Goddess to kill.

00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:21.583
The Goddess used to kill all such people  ...

00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:37.583
It's a very sad feeling

00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:42.709
that God has created human beings

00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:50.625
from amoeba to this stage, and how can we hate someone --

00:26:55.542 --> 00:26:58.208
and this is what has happened!

00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:03.625
Now of course Sahaj is different.

00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:09.166
The Sahajis know how to enjoy love.

00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:15.291
They like it.

00:27:15.542 --> 00:27:19.625
They enjoy it. You can see that.

00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:28.667
And if somehow, you people

00:27:29.667 --> 00:27:32.667
could manage to remove this hatred --

00:27:38.583 --> 00:27:43.500
somehow, somehow -- with your own will-power --

00:27:45.417 --> 00:27:51.208
denying and defying all that is being told to human beings,

00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:55.625
I am sure ....

00:28:02.208 --> 00:28:06.417
It's a very difficult work

00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:10.375
where those people who came

00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:14.041
on this earth went through all kinds of

00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:18.667
education, wanted

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:27.375
to improve the conditions, the relationships, friendships,

00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:34.333
have fallen into the depths of hatred ...

00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:56.000
My heart just weeps.

00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:03.208
At what time I have come on this earth,

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:09.250
where I have to see human beings hating each other.

00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:17.417
They talk of 'love' and 'hate'.

00:29:20.375 --> 00:29:22.583
It's a very serious thing,

00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:29.291
that you who are the children ...

00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:35.333
they'll end up like this ...

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:53.542
I mean, I have experiences that if I tell you you'll be shocked.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:30:03.041
How people have fallen down to the depth of evil nature.

00:30:07.208 --> 00:30:12.709
It's an understanding

00:30:16.417 --> 00:30:21.041
we have, to have understanding

00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:27.667
about ourselves: Do we hate somebody?

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.542
Do we get ideas that we shouldn't have, or do things? ...

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:40.709
Do you have such things in you?  Just find out!

00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:45.542
Do you hate other people?

00:30:54.667 --> 00:31:02.083
The ideas are rotten, absolutely, for the human mind.

00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:09.583
The ideas which are completely

00:31:12.166 --> 00:31:15.166
like the animals' instinct,

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:21.417
are absolutely no good for human beings at all.

00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:27.208
But that is what is happening, and it's coming forward ...

00:31:34.041 --> 00:31:38.333
If you are poor, alright,

00:31:39.291 --> 00:31:44.500
but by hating you don't become rich, no.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.709
If you are in any difficulties,

00:31:55.542 --> 00:32:01.458
then your duty is to remove those difficulties,

00:32:02.208 --> 00:32:04.709
but not to prosper on them.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.041
All this has to finish.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:17.166
It is very surprising that we are not bothered at all

00:32:17.667 --> 00:32:20.333
as to what we are doing.

00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:29.000
Yes, you have to have proper

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.458
sense of understanding:

00:32:38.125 --> 00:32:40.542
where are we going?

00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:50.291
If  you have misunderstanding about somebody,

00:32:50.709 --> 00:32:53.333
better take it out, completely.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.166
They try to trouble you, alright.

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:05.417
But don't have bad understanding about that person.

00:33:09.041 --> 00:33:15.166
Very surprising that we never see those things,

00:33:16.166 --> 00:33:22.000
how ugly they are, and how funny they are,

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:24.542
how they ruin our personality.

00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:34.291
You may be able to correct some people ...

00:33:53.417 --> 00:33:58.500
All our activities as Sahaja Yogis,

00:33:59.667 --> 00:34:04.166
I never realised were so important!

00:34:06.458 --> 00:34:09.166
We have to give so much time.

00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:17.709
Not to bother about nonsensical, frivolous things,

00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:23.542
but something serious that is within us or without,

00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:26.709
that must be taken out..

00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:38.166
If I ask you, 'How many people you hate?'

00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:46.291
You may say '20 people' and ...

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:14.333
You see the whole atmosphere in all this

00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:19.667
fills me with such remorse

00:35:21.166 --> 00:35:27.083
that I just don't know what are we going to do, the Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:34.667
What are their plans?

00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:41.125
Will you please look into yourself

00:35:42.458 --> 00:35:49.166
and think what constructive work we are doing

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.125
and what destructive work we have been doing.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.458
You need a big shock to understand this.

00:36:02.583 --> 00:36:08.166
I like the way we have programmes and Pujas and all that,

00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:11.583
but if you ask My Inner Being,

00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:17.333
I know it is very, very unhappy, very sick.

00:36:19.709 --> 00:36:25.625
At this time, what you have to do as Sahaja Yogis ...

00:36:30.542 --> 00:36:35.041
as Sahaja Yogis, minimum of minimum

00:36:35.417 --> 00:36:38.041
you should put full attention.

00:36:41.375 --> 00:36:46.458
And then you have to tell everybody ...

00:36:48.583 --> 00:36:52.333
You see the trouble with Sahaja Yoga is

00:36:53.208 --> 00:36:56.208
that you all start enjoying yourself,

00:36:57.458 --> 00:37:01.250
and then you don't see around what is happening.

00:37:04.125 --> 00:37:08.041
Now I must tell you

00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:16.041
I am now in the midst of war

00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:20.375
between myth ...

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:31.000
Is it an area, is it a --

00:37:32.542 --> 00:37:36.458
I don't know what should I say --is it (that)

00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:42.417
within us there is still lurking

00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:48.709
some kind of a weakness

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:57.250
that we do not try to fight our weakness ...

00:38:04.041 --> 00:38:09.291
I would now request you all to meditate

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.333
on yourself,

00:38:16.667 --> 00:38:23.041
and see for yourself what is wrong. ...

00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:37.125
It's a big shock,

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:46.250
and to reduce this shock, what can Sahaja Yogis do?

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:57.166
What can they work it out to blast this horrible

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.208
ways of human life?

00:39:07.583 --> 00:39:12.709
It's possible with the Power of Love --

00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:16.583
you can manage!

00:39:18.083 --> 00:39:21.709
But we must develop that power in our hearts.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.166
Think of it!  It's a big lesson now for all of us,

00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:34.458
to see for ourselves --

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.375
are we alright?  Or we go on hating others?

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:51.375
What is the function of our mind, is to hate or to love?

00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:59.041
And this love, if it enlightens you,

00:40:00.458 --> 00:40:04.166
you will be amazed, you will be such a big force for Me.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.583
I cannot fight the whole thing alone.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.333
I have to have people who really

00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:23.291
develop their love -- and nothing else!

00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:30.333
That is one of the challenges now for all of us,

00:40:31.083 --> 00:40:35.041
for all the Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:44.709
It's not only the fight between believers and non-believers,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.542
not only the fight between Sahaja Yogis and non-Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:57.083 --> 00:41:03.250
but this is a fight where we are all one

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.417
and we are going to fight it out.

00:41:08.709 --> 00:41:14.291
At every stage we have to be much more subtler.

00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:28.375
It is very, very essential to see to the point today --

00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:36.125
are we also part and parcel of that evil thing that is working out?

00:41:36.667 --> 00:41:41.500
Or are we free from that,

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:45.500
and prepared to fight it?

00:41:50.709 --> 00:41:56.000
It's a big fight and I hope it is conclusive!.

00:41:57.625 --> 00:42:03.417
After this there will be no more of

00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:07.500
cruelties to human beings,

00:42:10.166 --> 00:42:12.583
no more fights,

00:42:14.542 --> 00:42:20.625
because this is a fight between the rakshasas

00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:27.583
and ourselves.  It is not 'ordinary'.

00:42:30.333 --> 00:42:32.500
And this has to be explained,

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:37.458
also to those who are supportive of evil forces.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Only thing, 'Mother how are we to know

00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:49.667
who is against and who is not?'

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:56.125
You are knowledgeable; you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:04.291
you know who is on the wrong side.

00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:10.208
I know Sahaja Yogis can save,

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.583
and can bring them to the right path of knowledge and love.

00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:23.375
But -- be very careful with the propaganda

00:43:24.542 --> 00:43:27.333
of evil that is going on.

00:43:30.625 --> 00:43:35.250
I want to touch the deepest part of your heart,

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.709
which should reconcile ...

00:43:45.417 --> 00:43:50.625
I am sure you all will understand

00:43:51.333 --> 00:43:55.667
the magnitude of danger that awaits!

00:43:57.667 --> 00:44:02.583
Maybe there may not be any human beings left,

00:44:03.709 --> 00:44:07.583
maybe there may not be any children left.

00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:13.208
Because if this kind of thing is working out,

00:44:15.166 --> 00:44:18.208
it is very difficult, very difficult  ...

00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:35.667
My whole existence

00:44:37.542 --> 00:44:42.542
gets shaky, gets shaken up.

00:44:44.208 --> 00:44:48.458
You all should see in every

00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:52.083
nook and corner of life:

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:58.709
Where is this talk going on?  Where are people talking of cruelty?

00:44:59.375 --> 00:45:04.333
What's happening? ...

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:22.250
Whatever I think ...

00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:33.542
it's not one, it's not two, it's all of us.   ...

00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:56.166
The fight that I am having is of a very serious nature, no doubt.

00:45:57.208 --> 00:46:03.375
But if you all can fight collectively, how much

00:46:04.542 --> 00:46:06.208
we can work it out! ...

00:46:20.291 --> 00:46:24.208
My all efforts,

00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:30.000
understandings, powers,

00:46:30.709 --> 00:46:34.166
everything is now in your hands,

00:46:36.667 --> 00:46:40.333
and that's what you should be prepared for.

00:46:41.583 --> 00:46:47.667
Not by just reading something or

00:46:49.166 --> 00:46:52.500
talking about it, you have to build up within yourself

00:46:53.166 --> 00:46:55.375
the power of love.

00:47:00.041 --> 00:47:05.250
I am sure with the opening of the Sahasrara you will do.

00:47:06.166 --> 00:47:11.333
But try to read something, to understand something,

00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:14.333
with the Power of Love.

00:47:15.625 --> 00:47:19.542
It's a very deep subject, and when you talk about it,

00:47:20.125 --> 00:47:22.417
half-way I'm inside, half-way outside.

00:47:23.709 --> 00:47:27.333
But I have to tell you that you all develop this,

00:47:28.583 --> 00:47:35.375
and only that (Power of Love) will form a very strong opposition

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.583
to these 'evil doers' as they call it. ...

00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:54.333
My complete blessings are on you,

00:47:55.667 --> 00:48:01.250
and I want all of you to individually work it out.

00:48:02.542 --> 00:48:05.542
How many people you love, how many people ...

00:48:09.417 --> 00:48:11.542
This you have to find out.

00:48:22.542 --> 00:48:27.417
I hope you people have understood what I want you to do. ...

00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:39.709
A new generation is coming up  ...

00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:57.041
All of you, all of you, are in My Heart,

00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:02.250
and I love you very much,

00:49:03.583 --> 00:49:05.583
and I want you people

00:49:08.208 --> 00:49:12.291
to come as soldiers to fight with Me.

00:49:17.709 --> 00:49:23.250
I am also told that there are some people who are forming groups --

00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:25.625
extremely negative attitude!

00:49:26.083 --> 00:49:30.125
At this time what we need is complete solidarity.

00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:37.250
So all such people whom you see, tell them to behave themselves!

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:41.208
No use making them Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:46.208 --> 00:49:54.125
I am sure -- it's really heartfelt -- desire of mine

00:49:55.667 --> 00:50:01.166
that you should become really soldiers of love and peace.

00:50:02.417 --> 00:50:09.041
Because that is why you are here, you are born here for that.

00:50:11.166 --> 00:50:13.208
So enjoy yourself.
