00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:11.507
Today we are here

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:22.067
to celebrate Sahasrar Day.

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:40.187
It was not very difficult for Me to open the Sahasrar

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:44.147
because there were so many seekers in this world:

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:54.347
because, of course, I had studied also the permutations and combinations

00:00:54.467 --> 00:01:01.667
from which you all are, in a way, suffering;

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:07.747
also, the time had come.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:15.387
I felt [that] horrible gurus, who are really devils,

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:21.667
are trying to capture all the seekers.

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:29.147
I thought it’s high time that Sahasrara should be opened out.

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:44.227
It was not like Christ’s crucifixion by any chance.

00:01:44.347 --> 00:01:50.387
In those days one had to do lot of tapasya

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:55.827
and that’s what He went through.

00:01:55.947 --> 00:02:02.587
But in these modern times, what you know

00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:11.387
is much more important than what you do.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:20.227
It is such a universal awareness now

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:25.507
because of maybe, medias, because of communications,

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:33.707
because of travelling, that a human mind knows a lot.

00:02:33.827 --> 00:02:39.827
It knows so much sometimes that its brain cannot even bear it.

00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:44.907
It is so overloaded with ideas.

00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:51.587
And also the human mind is all the time anxious

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:59.587
to grasp, absorb and retain whatever he thinks is knowledge.

00:02:59.707 --> 00:03:04.867
But he lacks discretion, so all kind of things are accumulated

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:07.987
in his brain in the modern times.

00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:21.667
Specially with the advent of all these media like television, computers.

00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:27.987
Not a media, but it’s quite a complicated brain again.

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:33.387
The man had to know the technique of all these things very much.

00:03:33.507 --> 00:03:41.867
And this technique, if he understood, he could do many things,

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:47.907
many more things than your forefathers could do.

00:03:51.787 --> 00:04:01.187
Thus, materialism started taking its own development in the minds of people.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:06.907
So the curse of human beings, at that time, was materialism:

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:13.253
when I felt that Sahasrara must be opened out.

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:19.493
So this is how, when the Sahasrara opened,

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:25.493
the Kundalini started moving towards this Divine Power,

00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:36.573
getting connected with It and was all the time flowing within you,

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:40.853
when the Nirvikalpa state came.

00:04:40.973 --> 00:04:47.173
Now when it is coming through the Sahasrara,

00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:55.053
one has to know that the Sahasrara has to be clean,

00:04:55.173 --> 00:05:09.293
so that the flow of Divine Power is going, penetrating,

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:15.253
without any obstacle, without getting impure,

00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:22.733
without getting into any kind of problems.

00:05:22.853 --> 00:05:31.653
So, to get to that level, to that state,

00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:37.653
all the Sahaja Yogi, I am happy to know, are trying to work it out,

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:47.813
their own individual meditations also, so that this growth should take place.

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:57.693
Thus, you get enlightenment in a full way.

00:05:57.813 --> 00:06:03.693
But then one must ask why, for what? What’s the purpose?

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:12.093
What’s the aim? The aim is: your aim is lost.

00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:17.253
You don’t seek for aims at all anymore.

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:30.173
This pendal was built with such great ability for which we didn’t pay anything.

00:06:30.293 --> 00:06:36.013
Everybody was working here day and night, in the rainy season,

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:40.926
and I was quite worried about them. I said, “What’s the matter?”

00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:44.813
They said, “We are enjoying, Mother. We are enjoying!” “What are you enjoying?”

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:49.413
“We’re enjoying the rain.” All right. “We are enjoying the cold.” All right.

00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:55.253
“Enjoying everything, lifting all these heavy things, everything we are enjoying.”

00:06:56.013 --> 00:07:00.053
I was quite surprised at them. Nobody had any complaints,

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:08.693
but everybody was just on the warpath, building this tent for you.

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:14.653
So what happens? Once your Sahasrara is clean,

00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:21.453
this flow of joy doesn’t allow you even to think

00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:24.799
that you are exerting or you are working.

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:30.512
Then we have some Sahaja Yogis who have such problems,

00:07:30.632 --> 00:07:34.792
who come to Sahaja Yoga with problems.

00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:39.032
Then, these people see them with these problems they are still continuing.

00:07:39.152 --> 00:07:42.032
Now the Sahasrara doesn’t want to accept it.

00:07:42.152 --> 00:07:45.832
“It’s terrible. I was like him. No, no, no, no more.

00:07:45.952 --> 00:07:48.912
Me, I don’t want to be that kind.”

00:07:49.032 --> 00:07:56.912
So they abhor the person who was just like them;

00:07:57.032 --> 00:08:03.592
they just can’t bear him, they just can’t tolerate him.

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:08.952
Then I would say still you have to grow.

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:14.472
You have to grow, your Sahasrara has to be cleansed out

00:08:14.592 --> 00:08:21.072
at such a speed, at such a level and stage

00:08:21.192 --> 00:08:25.872
that, like soap cleanses everything, it should cleanse everything else,

00:08:25.992 --> 00:08:33.152
should not be afraid of anything, should not have any worry

00:08:33.272 --> 00:08:37.832
about the conditionings of others or ego of others:

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:40.912
that is the state now we have to reach.

00:08:41.032 --> 00:08:47.192
Today is the Sahasrara Day, is the 23rd Sahasrara Day

00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:57.752
and I shouldn’t expect much, I don’t want to say anything much about it:

00:08:57.872 --> 00:09:05.112
but I wish and I hope that all the thousand petals of your Sahasraras

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:10.112
will be so cleansed that you will never catch from anybody;

00:09:10.232 --> 00:09:12.912
you will never be frightened of anybody.

00:09:13.032 --> 00:09:19.352
You will be masters of all kinds of curatives

00:09:19.472 --> 00:09:32.072
and also you will be the one who can give solace, peace to others;

00:09:32.192 --> 00:09:37.392
you will be the one who will be organising programs outside,

00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:43.952
you will be the one who will be responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:46.472 --> 00:09:50.352
And when that happens, then we can see

00:09:50.472 --> 00:09:57.952
that these thousand petals of the Sahasrara have opened out.

00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:16.352
These thousand petals are not yet awakened.

00:10:16.472 --> 00:10:30.232
They signify the different thousand powers of the Goddess, minimum of minimum.

00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:36.832
These thousand ones you can open out yourself

00:10:36.952 --> 00:10:46.352
by introspection, by looking at yourself, making fun of yourself.

00:10:46.472 --> 00:10:52.592
“Know Thyself” means know yourself with all the defects you have

00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:58.152
and also the potential you have and all the good points you have.

00:10:58.272 --> 00:11:02.752
So as far as you are concerned, when you are looking at yourself

00:11:02.872 --> 00:11:07.192
you should just see to the defects that you have.

00:11:07.312 --> 00:11:14.272
“Why do I behave like this? Why do I assert so much?

00:11:14.392 --> 00:11:21.392
What’s the problem? Why can’t I see myself clearly?”

00:11:21.512 --> 00:11:28.552
With that transparency of your Sahasrara, you can see your heart,

00:11:28.672 --> 00:11:36.112
you can see your mind, you can see yourself fully, clearly,

00:11:36.232 --> 00:11:39.512
what’s wrong with you.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:49.752
This transparency can come only if you have really

00:11:50.952 --> 00:11:59.832
the pure desire, shuddha iccha, to be of that level.

00:12:00.472 --> 00:12:09.872
Now, there is no competition between A and B.

00:12:09.992 --> 00:12:15.952
We don’t say that, “You got the first prize for coming out of the Sahasrara”

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:21.832
or we don’t say, “You have the second prize.”

00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:27.232
There’s nothing like first, second in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:28.552 --> 00:12:36.992
because we are not running the race. There’s no competition between us.

00:12:37.112 --> 00:12:41.312
Whatever we are doing is for our own satisfaction.

00:12:41.432 --> 00:12:46.672
Now think of something. There are five people who are running.

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:52.312
Now they have to think, out of these five people, who goes first.

00:12:52.432 --> 00:12:58.832
Here it is the other way round: the five people are meditating;

00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:07.312
now everyone individually has to see for himself if he satisfies himself or not,

00:13:07.832 --> 00:13:10.232
nobody else is going to give you a certificate.

00:13:10.352 --> 00:13:15.752
It is you who has to give certificate to yourself, honestly.

00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:19.272
It’s a very different position.

00:13:19.392 --> 00:13:25.152
It is you, your Sahasrara and your attention

00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:29.192
and you have to see, within yourself,

00:13:29.312 --> 00:13:36.432
“How far have I realised my own powers,

00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:44.392
my own compassion, my own personality?”

00:13:44.512 --> 00:13:53.952
You’ll have to test it yourself. It is you are the one who decides.

00:13:54.072 --> 00:13:57.432
When you are the one who is running,

00:13:57.552 --> 00:14:04.672
it is you are the one who decides without running,

00:14:04.792 --> 00:14:09.272
then what is the question of competition?

00:14:11.552 --> 00:14:19.552
The whole thing disappears into nothing.

00:14:20.352 --> 00:14:24.552
As I told you the other day, an analogy

00:14:24.672 --> 00:14:33.512
that, if you are looking at the mirror, then you are the one who is observing,

00:14:33.632 --> 00:14:42.472
your reflection is the one that is observed and there is the action of seeing,

00:14:42.592 --> 00:14:50.952
so you are in three dimensions. But supposing you become the mirror yourself,

00:14:54.352 --> 00:15:00.952
the whole process is reversed: You see yourself.

00:15:01.072 --> 00:15:04.112
You don’t have to see because you are seeing it all the time,

00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:06.472
it’s just spontaneous.

00:15:06.592 --> 00:15:11.872
In the same manner, when it comes to Sahasrara,

00:15:11.992 --> 00:15:18.352
it is your Sahasrara itself gives you the full idea as to how you are.

00:15:18.472 --> 00:15:23.152
The diagnosis comes from your own Sahasrara.

00:15:23.272 --> 00:15:26.992
Your own Sahasrara tells you what centres are catching

00:15:27.112 --> 00:15:33.032
because all the peethas of these seven centres are in the Sahasrara.

00:15:33.152 --> 00:15:40.792
As if the Sahasrara is now watching yourself

00:15:40.912 --> 00:15:43.872
and reporting to you, “See, this is wrong with you.

00:15:43.992 --> 00:15:46.712
This is wrong with you, this is wrong with you.”

00:15:46.832 --> 00:15:51.232
So, Sahasrara being the best well-wisher that you have,

00:15:51.352 --> 00:15:54.152
gives you the right information about yourself,

00:15:54.272 --> 00:15:57.952
so the best is that you correct yourself.

00:15:58.072 --> 00:16:06.152
So then, achieve that perfect state: that is what you have to do.

00:16:06.272 --> 00:16:08.792
But once you have achieved the perfect state,

00:16:08.912 --> 00:16:13.872
you have achieved your aim, you have no aim left.

00:16:13.992 --> 00:16:19.592
Like the lights now, till you have to make the lights, you had to work hard,

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:26.872
make the lights, put them right, do everything that is necessary.

00:16:26.992 --> 00:16:29.712
But once it is made and the light comes into it,

00:16:29.832 --> 00:16:39.592
then the job of the light is to give the light.

00:16:39.712 --> 00:16:44.032
So the first function is over.

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:52.712
Now the second function is to give it back.

00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:57.392
You reach your aim, your destination.

00:16:57.512 --> 00:17:00.192
For example, I had to come here. All right?

00:17:00.312 --> 00:17:05.472
So I come all the way from My house, come in the car,

00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:13.232
walking and come and sit down here. Now it’s finished that part, over.

00:17:13.352 --> 00:17:19.152
Now I don’t have to walk, otherwise I’ll be all the time running.

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:25.112
So, all this mad race of this brain stops.

00:17:25.232 --> 00:17:30.672
For what should it be used now?

00:17:31.232 --> 00:17:37.192
For enjoying the peace, for enjoying the joy,

00:17:37.312 --> 00:17:42.232
for enjoying the collectivity.

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:47.592
So, the labour or the hard work

00:17:47.712 --> 00:17:51.552
or you can also say the planning of the future finishes off.

00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:56.100
Only thing now you have got it, so better enjoy it.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:02.726
So, we have lost now the sense of aim. We don’t have any aims.

00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:06.126
We just want to enjoy.

00:18:07.526 --> 00:18:11.286
It’s a very, very big thing that has happened

00:18:11.406 --> 00:18:19.886
because, as you know, the joy in the Sahasrara is nira-ananda, nira-ananda.

00:18:20.006 --> 00:18:30.406
Of course, Nira is My name also, but it means pure absolute joy.

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:33.806
Nira-ananda.

00:18:35.086 --> 00:18:40.486
And that nirananda, that joy has no other hues.

00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:45.126
It’s just pure, pure joy.

00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:49.406
Without thinking, it just pours into it.

00:18:49.526 --> 00:18:52.246
After all, every activity is for what?

00:18:52.366 --> 00:18:56.846
For getting some sort of a pleasure, sensation

00:18:56.966 --> 00:19:01.086
and also, some people believe, for joy. It’s not.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:04.966
Only after the opening of Sahasrara and the cleansing of it,

00:19:05.086 --> 00:19:09.166
then you will know what is joy. You can’t explain it,

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:14.446
how you can spend hours together like this. People don’t understand, you know.

00:19:14.566 --> 00:19:17.046
Like even our mayor was telling Me that,

00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:20.246
“We can’t sit in the church for more than fifteen minutes.

00:19:20.366 --> 00:19:25.446
And how people are sitting here for so many hours?

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:29.566
Fifteen minutes we cannot sit, but how these people are sitting

00:19:29.686 --> 00:19:33.566
for such a long time? What are they doing there?

00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:38.406
What is their entertainment? How can they sit for hours together?

00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:42.366
Without saying anything, without dropping even a pin,

00:19:42.486 --> 00:19:45.326
they are just all the time there.

00:19:45.446 --> 00:19:49.206
So what have you given them? What is happening to them?”

00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:55.446
This is very surprising and remarkable that these people,

00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:58.806
who are not even Sahaja Yogis, can see clearly

00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:04.206
that you people are least bothered, you are absolutely enjoying life.

00:20:04.326 --> 00:20:09.526
Whatever you may be doing is not important, what is important is

00:20:09.646 --> 00:20:13.446
that, whether you are working in the office or outside,

00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:18.246
you are full of joy, enjoying everything.

00:20:18.366 --> 00:20:21.246
This is the most important thing in life,

00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:25.606
which you can have only through Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:32.326
because your Sahasraras are open, because they are opened out.

00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:37.406
There is now one more thing I have to tell you,

00:20:37.526 --> 00:20:42.486
that is very important for all of you to remember:

00:20:42.606 --> 00:20:50.966
that, while living in this Ocean of Joy, we have to remember

00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:55.286
that there are many who have not yet jumped into it,

00:20:55.406 --> 00:21:00.726
so we have to bring them in; and it’s such a pleasure, it’s such a joy

00:21:00.846 --> 00:21:06.246
to give realisation to someone, extremely joyful.

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:11.406
So we need people who would come and say that,

00:21:11.526 --> 00:21:16.646
“We’ll definitely come for this [work].”

00:21:17.966 --> 00:21:23.126
I mean, they should really come forward

00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:30.206
and, once they come forward, you’ll be amazed how things will work out.

00:21:30.326 --> 00:21:35.446
There are many, I know, who are going all over, everywhere

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:38.686
and spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:38.806 --> 00:21:44.086
So is very important for all of you to know that you have got the light

00:21:44.206 --> 00:21:47.926
to be given to others. Come forward.

00:21:48.046 --> 00:21:52.526
Don’t have fear of your ego, conditionings, nothing. Come forward.

00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:56.606
You have all the strength, you have everything within yourself

00:21:56.726 --> 00:22:01.086
and you will do everything with such happiness and joy.

00:22:01.206 --> 00:22:03.846
Everywhere, in every country people are doing that,

00:22:03.966 --> 00:22:07.006
but some of them are doing, some of them are not doing.

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:13.566
All of you are quite capable of doing it, so please come forward

00:22:13.686 --> 00:22:18.326
and see for yourself what you are capable of.

00:22:20.086 --> 00:22:23.366
First of all, you should have faith in yourself.

00:22:23.486 --> 00:22:27.446
If you have no faith in yourself, you cannot do anything.

00:22:27.566 --> 00:22:33.766
Have faith. You should have no fears of any kind.

00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:44.406
And also, to introspect, to see within yourself what’s going on.

00:22:44.526 --> 00:22:48.926
To be very frank, I find My brain absolutely empty.

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:52.606
What I talk from this emptiness, I don’t know.

00:22:52.726 --> 00:22:57.766
You will also find your brain absolutely empty,

00:22:57.886 --> 00:23:04.526
and still with that empty brain, you will be achieving a lot.

00:23:04.646 --> 00:23:09.086
It’s very remarkable, as you have seen that from the candle you get cool breeze.

00:23:09.206 --> 00:23:12.806
How you can get it from the candle, cool breeze?

00:23:12.926 --> 00:23:16.206
You do get.

00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:23.166
So, is important to recognise yourself as a Sahaja Yogi

00:23:23.286 --> 00:23:32.446
and to recognise what have you done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:37.726
Without doing for Sahaja Yoga, you cannot enjoy life.

00:23:37.846 --> 00:23:42.846
That was your aim, and that aim you have reached.

00:23:42.966 --> 00:23:46.326
Now, if you don’t… supposing I have to come and sit on this thing

00:23:46.446 --> 00:23:51.526
and I don’t sit on this thing, then what’s the use of coming here?

00:23:52.526 --> 00:23:56.086
I came here to tell you something about Sahasrara

00:23:56.206 --> 00:23:59.686
and if I don’t tell you, then what’s the use of My coming here

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:02.926
and celebrating Sahasrara Day?

00:24:03.046 --> 00:24:06.486
In the same way, when you have reached that state now,

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:09.125
what you have to do is not to use for your own purpose.

00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:13.926
You have used it, quite a lot, for your health, wealth, everything.

00:24:14.046 --> 00:24:17.486
Now what are we doing about Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:17.606 --> 00:24:20.846
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:24.685
After some time, you will do a lot and you will never know

00:24:24.766 --> 00:24:27.886
you have done anything for Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:35.726
Very surprising, it happens to so many of you and should happen to all of you.

00:24:35.846 --> 00:24:41.846
I hope all of you will realise that your Sahasraras are cleaned, completely,

00:24:41.966 --> 00:24:44.966
you are perfectly all right, you don’t have to worry about it,

00:24:45.086 --> 00:24:53.246
and you can really go ahead with spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:55.526
May God bless you all.
