20:05.170 --> 20:15.690
I am very fortunate and I am very happy that
I could come to Santa Cruz.

20:15.690 --> 20:27.570
I can see what I am facing is the ocean of
Love, the seekers of Love, the people who

20:27.570 --> 20:30.860
are seeking the Truth.

20:30.860 --> 20:35.460
Gregoire has told you all these things because
he is very earnest, he is very concerned,

20:35.460 --> 20:42.860
he knows you are seekers and that’s why
he has told you in these words, so don’t

20:42.860 --> 20:43.860
be frightened.

20:43.860 --> 20:48.320
There is nothing to be frightened about anything.

20:48.320 --> 20:55.110
You are seekers and you are a special category.

20:55.110 --> 21:00.820
In the eyes of God, seekers are the highest
creation that He has created.

21:00.820 --> 21:05.830
You are the highest of all.

21:05.830 --> 21:19.240
To Him it does not matter who are rich, who
are in power, who are leading a life of so-called

21:19.240 --> 21:20.240
success.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.930
It does not matter to Him at all, He does
not understand that, He does not know that.

21:23.930 --> 21:29.100
Christ has said that these people if they
want gold, let them have.

21:29.100 --> 21:34.380
They’ll have bars of gold and live with
it.

21:34.380 --> 21:48.740
But “if they seek Me, if they love Me,”
then these people who are seekers today are

21:48.740 --> 21:53.920
going to enter into the Kingdom of God and
He will eat with them.

21:53.920 --> 21:59.720
They will sit at the same table.

21:59.720 --> 22:03.280
You are respected because you are seekers.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.500
You are loved because you are seekers.

22:06.500 --> 22:14.650
And you have survived despite all the attacks
on you.

22:14.650 --> 22:17.260
These are all attacks.

22:17.260 --> 22:22.120
You are naîve, you are simple, you were innocent
at that time when attacks came in.

22:22.120 --> 22:27.840
Now gradually you are discovering that it
was an attack.

22:27.840 --> 22:32.980
Everything that you did was just to put you
down.

22:32.980 --> 22:41.540
And one person who was negative of that kind
would come forward and assert and use all

22:41.540 --> 22:47.200
the negative forces to push you down.

22:47.200 --> 22:52.060
To me you are my children.

22:52.060 --> 23:01.060
To me I don’t think what you have done because
you didn’t meet me that time.

23:01.060 --> 23:04.480
I take the load upon myself.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.980
I did come to San Jose last time.

23:05.980 --> 23:16.760
They said that there are lots of seekers settling
down in Santa Cruz.

23:16.760 --> 23:29.150
I wanted to come and see you here that time
only, but the experience I had of the people

23:29.150 --> 23:33.910
who were there, I thought, “They are not
just now seeking God, but they are sort of

23:33.910 --> 23:43.010
seeking ego or superego, they are seeking
into a new style of life and a new style of

23:43.010 --> 23:47.070
understanding, because they have found out
that material life is of no value, it’s

23:47.070 --> 23:49.840
not going to give them joy."

23:49.840 --> 23:56.230
At that time, when I said that, and you are
thinking of these things, how can you pay

23:56.230 --> 23:57.230
for it?

23:57.230 --> 23:59.070
Nobody could understand these things.

23:59.070 --> 24:02.740
It was very difficult to talk to them – that
it is spontaneous, it is your own right, that

24:02.740 --> 24:05.730
you have to get it.

24:05.730 --> 24:09.180
You have been seeking for ages now, not only
in this life time.

24:09.180 --> 24:15.540
You have been saints in many lives and now
you are born here to seek it.

24:15.540 --> 24:18.400
It’s so simple as that.

24:18.400 --> 24:23.040
It has to happen, that’s your nature, that’s
what you are.

24:23.040 --> 24:29.770
You try anything else, you won’t be satisfied
‘till you have found out the Truth.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.580
But that time nobody would listen to me.

24:31.580 --> 24:39.180
It was a very funny situation and I ultimately
decided that let them find out for themselves

24:39.180 --> 24:40.660
to begin with.

24:40.660 --> 24:45.470
When they will find it out, they have to reach
the right conclusion.

24:45.470 --> 24:53.500
Because there is one problem in the seeking,
that you have to seek in your own freedom,

24:53.500 --> 24:59.220
in your own glory of your own choice.

24:59.220 --> 25:03.870
Because if you are to be liberated, it has
to be a free choice.

25:03.870 --> 25:09.620
If a person is not free, say, he is enticed
or he is hypnotised or he is overpowered by

25:09.620 --> 25:12.750
others, he has no freedom at all of any kind.

25:12.750 --> 25:16.580
Such a person is useless to enter into the
Kingdom of God.

25:16.580 --> 25:24.780
If you have to become the King, then you have
to have that basic freedom in yourself intact.

25:24.780 --> 25:31.430
But freedom doesn’t mean ego by any chance.

25:31.430 --> 25:38.120
If you think: “I like it, I love it, I do
it,” that’s not the Spirit.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.190
You are not seekers of ego, I must tell you
very frankly, you are not.

25:41.190 --> 25:48.090
You are seekers of Truth, of Love, of Joy.

25:48.090 --> 25:50.130
For ages you’ve been seeking that.

25:50.130 --> 25:58.290
Joy is the result when you get to that position
where you become your Spirit, your Atma.

25:58.290 --> 26:03.440
You should be in Joy, not talking about it,
but enjoying it.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.310
And that has to happen to you.

26:06.310 --> 26:11.120
It’s a happening for which you have built
in for ages.

26:11.120 --> 26:20.280
Today, in general, I will tell you what you
are really and what you have to expect.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.720
Nobody has told you about it.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.940
They said, “All right, you’ll come to
us into a new age."

26:25.940 --> 26:27.960
“All right,” people said.

26:27.960 --> 26:36.310
“Let’s go and join!” Somebody says that
you’ll get this.

26:36.310 --> 26:37.310
You joined.

26:37.310 --> 26:42.880
William Blake is one of the greatest prophets
of the modern times.

26:42.880 --> 26:50.500
For you Western people, he said that “The
men of God,” that means you people.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.400
You are people of God.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.250
You are not of this gross level.

26:55.250 --> 26:59.310
If people don’t understand you that does
not mean that I don’t understand.

26:59.310 --> 27:00.720
I know you, what you are.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.000
I know what it is, I can feel it.

27:04.000 --> 27:13.840
He said, “Men of God will become prophets,
and these prophets will have powers to make

27:13.840 --> 27:18.400
others prophets."

27:18.400 --> 27:27.680
This is what we have to expect within ourselves.

27:27.680 --> 27:42.190
So you have to become the prophet and you
have to make others prophet.

27:42.190 --> 27:50.940
Now this is the point you should judge: Have
you become the prophet?

27:50.940 --> 27:54.490
What is a prophet?

27:54.490 --> 28:04.770
Prophet is a person who can feel the all-pervading
power around.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.310
Now I said there is all-pervading power of
Love.

28:07.310 --> 28:14.270
Oh you also sing the song, they say, “Yes,
there is all-pervading power."

28:14.270 --> 28:19.210
Many people also feel that they are feeling
it, but it’s not true.

28:19.210 --> 28:23.870
We have to be honest to ourselves because
we are seekers, we should not cheat ourselves

28:23.870 --> 28:30.360
because this is ego that makes you cheat.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.280
This intelligence is the worst thing.

28:32.280 --> 28:38.550
Gregoire himself told me one day, “I find
my intelligence is trying to cheat me."

28:38.550 --> 28:42.050
Very intelligently.

28:42.050 --> 28:48.690
So one has to be very careful to understand
that you have to become that.

28:48.690 --> 29:00.260
If you play around with your ego, your superego,
your conditionings or mesmerism or hypnosis,

29:00.260 --> 29:03.780
and your ideas about having a kind of life,
you are the loser.

29:03.780 --> 29:10.260
All that could be a great barrier to be the
Spirit, which is a different thing altogether,

29:10.260 --> 29:14.060
is beyond this.

29:14.060 --> 29:20.540
So when you become the Spirit, what happens
to you, what should you expect?

29:20.540 --> 29:26.670
Of course it’s true that this all-pervading
power is there.

29:26.670 --> 29:34.730
If I say there are lots of plays going on
here, there is a music going on here, you

29:34.730 --> 29:35.730
won’t believe.

29:35.730 --> 29:41.650
If I bring the television and say, “Now,
this is the one which is going to show you."

29:41.650 --> 29:42.650
You will say, “Oh."

29:42.650 --> 29:43.650
I mean, you know it.

29:43.650 --> 29:45.820
But in India, if I take it to a village who
has never seen a television, they’ll say,

29:45.820 --> 29:47.200
“This box?

29:47.200 --> 29:53.220
How can it do it?” But you put it to the
mains and fantastic things can happen.

29:53.220 --> 29:56.000
It catches all that.

29:56.000 --> 30:05.100
In the same way, when you become that, when
you get a little breakthrough, it’s just

30:05.100 --> 30:06.610
the plugging to the mains.

30:06.610 --> 30:09.760
You are all ready for that.

30:09.760 --> 30:12.440
And the fantastic thing happens.

30:12.440 --> 30:16.320
First you start feeling it all around.

30:16.320 --> 30:20.040
Now don’t jump into ego.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.000
That’s not the end of it.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.480
You first start feeling it.

30:25.480 --> 30:33.740
Then you start understanding that your centres
are on your fingertips.

30:33.740 --> 30:42.700
It means that you are the master of that.

30:42.700 --> 30:51.160
Then I’m here just to decode it, to tell
you, that this is what this finger means.

30:51.160 --> 30:54.320
You verify it.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.880
It is so much surprising when people verify
it.

30:57.880 --> 31:01.720
There was a gentleman in London.

31:01.720 --> 31:10.810
I had seven hippies in London and I worked
on them for four years, English people are

31:10.810 --> 31:12.690
a little difficult to crack.

31:12.690 --> 31:22.390
But after four years they really got their
realization in a proper way and after that

31:22.390 --> 31:28.470
now we have thousands of people who are realized
in England.

31:28.470 --> 31:33.870
Because once they find something, then they
get to it.

31:33.870 --> 31:37.040
They’re not the people who are shifty.

31:37.040 --> 31:41.930
Somehow they have that much wisdom, that balance
in them.

31:41.930 --> 31:49.230
They understand that if you have found a little
water in a place, then go on digging there

31:49.230 --> 31:50.640
alone to have the well.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.920
They don’t leave that and go to another
place and dig well and dig well and dig well.

31:54.920 --> 31:58.850
They can know where to stop.

31:58.850 --> 32:04.800
So these people were very skeptical in the
beginning.

32:04.800 --> 32:13.910
One of them got Realization and he said, “Mother,
it is all pervading, it has got telecommunication

32:13.910 --> 32:16.290
and everything.

32:16.290 --> 32:22.120
What about my Father who has not telephoned
to me and who always writes to me and has

32:22.120 --> 32:23.300
not written to me?

32:23.300 --> 32:24.620
He’s in Scotland."

32:24.620 --> 32:28.160
I said, “You trunk call him just now."

32:28.160 --> 32:29.770
I said, “You feel it.

32:29.770 --> 32:31.450
Just put your hands like that."

32:31.450 --> 32:34.310
And he said,”I am getting a burning here."

32:34.310 --> 32:40.000
I said:”That means he must be down with
very bad bronchitis.

32:40.000 --> 32:46.950
These are the centers of your father and this
is the finger which denotes this center.

32:46.950 --> 32:49.120
You telephone to him and find out."

32:49.120 --> 32:57.500
He telephoned to him and the mother said exactly
the same centers, that he’s down with very

32:57.500 --> 32:58.810
bad bronchitis.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.870
This could be a cock and bull story.

33:00.870 --> 33:11.740
The way Gregoire was telling you, he was trying
to establish my credibility to you, because

33:11.740 --> 33:16.300
it is such an apologetic condition in which
I have come.

33:16.300 --> 33:20.190
It‘s a very funny situation, I know that.

33:20.190 --> 33:25.370
The other day I went to see a very influential
Indian man.

33:25.370 --> 33:29.370
Of course, he knows me, because of my husband
maybe.

33:29.370 --> 33:36.060
He knows that a person of that status may
not come to this level of cheating others,

33:36.060 --> 33:37.060
whatever it is.

33:37.060 --> 33:47.450
But still he told me that he can’t understand
how people are taking to these horrible gurus

33:47.450 --> 33:53.770
and how these gurus came and cheated me also
and I helped them.

33:53.770 --> 34:06.890
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a spontaneous happening,
a living happening.

34:06.890 --> 34:12.910
You are a living being and the force of God
is also living.

34:12.910 --> 34:27.290
Just like a fruit comes out of a flower, just
like this living process takes place, you

34:27.290 --> 34:28.970
become your Spirit.

34:28.970 --> 34:36.550
We never think this thing is around us, every
day we see.

34:36.550 --> 34:38.820
This is worked out by this all pervading Power.

34:38.820 --> 34:43.060
We can’t do even with one flower.

34:43.060 --> 34:47.560
We cannot transform even one flower into a
fruit.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.590
We take it for granted.

34:49.590 --> 34:52.760
We never know that all such living things
are done.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.760
Now look at it.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.560
There is a little bird, which lays the egg.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.630
For what?

34:58.630 --> 35:02.250
The eggs are kept in the nest.

35:02.250 --> 35:10.270
The all pervading Power works it out in such
a way that the eggs grow and the bird hatches

35:10.270 --> 35:17.020
them and from these eggs comes out a bird.

35:17.020 --> 35:20.870
We have seen caterpillars turning into butterflies.

35:20.870 --> 35:23.250
We never think how it happens.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.620
We just take it for granted.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.200
We enjoy their colors.

35:27.200 --> 35:34.940
We never see how this transformation has taken
place and this transmutation has taken place.

35:34.940 --> 35:41.870
In Sanskrit language a realized soul is called
as dwijaha, is the one who is born twice.

35:41.870 --> 35:44.000
Of course, this is also another problem.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.110
Last time I said you are to be born actually
again.

35:48.110 --> 35:49.660
It is a living process.

35:49.660 --> 35:57.200
The Kundalini has to move throughout the centers
and you have to feel the actualization of

35:57.200 --> 36:02.380
your Realization, meaning that you must feel
the cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle

36:02.380 --> 36:03.760
bone area.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.670
Realization you have to feel.

36:05.670 --> 36:10.620
It’s an actualization, not a vague belief,
I told them hundred times.

36:10.620 --> 36:13.620
And they were taping me.

36:13.620 --> 36:16.050
Some people told me, ”Mother, don’t allow
them to tape."

36:16.050 --> 36:18.630
I said, “Let them tape! What’s the matter?

36:18.630 --> 36:20.570
I am not running any enterprise."

36:20.570 --> 36:26.120
They said, “No, they will use it for some
purpose."

36:26.120 --> 36:27.500
I said, “Let them use it.

36:27.500 --> 36:30.190
For what purpose they are going to use I don’t
understand."

36:30.190 --> 36:32.160
I don’t understand these human laws.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.540
I am very bad at it.

36:34.540 --> 36:38.370
And human beings I am also worse.

36:38.370 --> 36:43.920
These people met me the other day in Sydney
after so many years.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.490
They have branded themselves as born again.

36:46.490 --> 36:52.290
And they just self-certificated that we are
born again.

36:52.290 --> 36:54.300
I said, ”But how?”

36:54.300 --> 36:56.810
“But we are born again."

36:56.810 --> 37:02.470
“But what is the proof that you are born
again, my children?

37:02.470 --> 37:04.180
How do you believe you are born again?

37:04.180 --> 37:06.710
There must be some proof of it.

37:06.710 --> 37:07.800
“Oh, we are born again.

37:07.800 --> 37:08.800
Finished."

37:08.800 --> 37:11.820
Now, you cannot self-certify yourself.

37:11.820 --> 37:15.100
If you do that, it is Ego.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.240
Understand that.

37:16.240 --> 37:23.970
If you are born again, you should be able
to feel the centers of other people, you should

37:23.970 --> 37:31.650
be able to feel your own centers, you should
be able to judge yourself and cure yourself

37:31.650 --> 37:33.480
and you could cure others.

37:33.480 --> 37:39.120
Not only that, but you can raise their Kundalini
and give them Realization.

37:39.120 --> 37:46.460
This is the minimum of minimums to them.

37:46.460 --> 37:50.350
I mean an egg, if it is chanting, “I am
a bird,” does it become?

37:50.350 --> 37:53.480
It’s an egg and an egg is an egg.

37:53.480 --> 38:03.840
If it says, “Oh, I am
a bird."

38:03.840 --> 38:05.610
It can’t fly.

38:05.610 --> 38:08.560
It has to really fly.

38:08.560 --> 38:11.660
Some of the nursery rhymes are Humpty Dumpty
sat on the wall.

38:11.660 --> 38:14.170
That’s what they are.

38:14.170 --> 38:17.030
They believe that they are great people.

38:17.030 --> 38:23.040
They sat on the wall and when they fell down,
all the King’s horses and all the King’s

38:23.040 --> 38:27.220
men could not put them together again.

38:27.220 --> 38:31.280
This is a make believe, that we are born again.

38:31.280 --> 38:35.380
But it’s of no use to you.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.140
You are Seekers.

38:37.140 --> 38:40.380
You are nothing but Seekers of Spirit.

38:40.380 --> 38:43.300
Accept that situation, first of all.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.090
Accept your Self.

38:45.090 --> 38:51.700
These false certificates are not going to
help you, by any chance.

38:51.700 --> 38:56.910
Again I go away, you find another Guru, get
after him, get after another, get after another

38:56.910 --> 38:57.910
one.

38:57.910 --> 39:00.140
Some of them just end up into a lunatic Asylum.

39:00.140 --> 39:03.910
I don’t know what to do with them.

39:03.910 --> 39:11.100
When this happens to you, physically you feel
all right.

39:11.100 --> 39:14.540
I mean cancers can only be cured through your
Kundalini awakening.

39:14.540 --> 39:17.470
I’ve been saying this for the last ten years.

39:17.470 --> 39:21.790
I’ve also cured cancer automatically of
people as a by product.

39:21.790 --> 39:26.540
All diseases get cured.-That is the minimum
of minimum that should happen to you.

39:26.540 --> 39:33.100
After all, Realization is not some sort of
a cheap thing you can buy in the market like

39:33.100 --> 39:36.390
a take away food.

39:36.390 --> 39:43.590
It is your Spirit, which is an eternal Being,
which you achieve.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.020
You achieve your absolute value.

39:45.020 --> 39:49.280
You become that though it happens so spontaneously,
so easily that you can’t believe.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.460
Now you have no self esteem.

39:51.460 --> 39:56.010
You can’t believe it that you have really
got it in the beginning.

39:56.010 --> 39:58.030
People just don’t believe it.

39:58.030 --> 39:59.530
It is impossible.

39:59.530 --> 40:06.580
And when they don’t believe it, they don’t
want to practice it any further.

40:06.580 --> 40:09.940
It’s so surprising.

40:09.940 --> 40:17.630
First you have to get the sprouting of Kundalini
and then you have to allow it to grow and

40:17.630 --> 40:23.560
once you grow into it, then you are like a
tree.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.850
As Gregoire says it’s true.

40:25.850 --> 40:35.370
He was here in Santa Cruz, went to Berkeley,
there he met a very good Sahaja Yogi from

40:35.370 --> 40:39.160
India and just came down to London.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.940
That time I saw him and I said, “Look at
this Seeker coming down."

40:41.940 --> 40:48.700
I went to receive him at the station and I
was surprised – he was so frantic, he was

40:48.700 --> 40:54.310
so upset and I was surprised that the centers…
I know what he was.

40:54.310 --> 40:56.090
He is a Seeker, I know that.

40:56.090 --> 40:59.670
That had such love, and such feeling.

40:59.670 --> 41:01.210
I said, “ Look at this my child.

41:01.210 --> 41:02.210
Where is he lost?

41:02.210 --> 41:06.510
What has happened to you?”

41:06.510 --> 41:11.910
Now, we have to know what we are, what we
have to achieve and where we are to go.

41:11.910 --> 41:12.910
That’s an important thing.

41:12.910 --> 41:20.350
As I have told you, you must know what you
have to achieve, what you get.

41:20.350 --> 41:21.820
In a very gross way I’ve told you.

41:21.820 --> 41:26.890
Actually, it’s so dynamic, it is so fantastic
that if I tell you any more stories of it,

41:26.890 --> 41:31.340
you’d say it’s really a cock and bull
story.

41:31.340 --> 41:32.340
But there is God.

41:32.340 --> 41:40.720
He’s there, no doubt and He is dynamic and
He is all powerful and that He is all Love

41:40.720 --> 41:45.500
and that He loves you so much that he wants
you to enjoy His Kingdom.

41:45.500 --> 41:48.140
It’s true, no doubt about it.

41:48.140 --> 41:53.200
I am here to prove everything to you, not
to talk and give sermons and all that, but

41:53.200 --> 41:56.330
to prove it to you.

41:56.330 --> 42:08.050
And his Powers are so fantastic, at every
level how they work out is amazing.

42:08.050 --> 42:10.400
You have to just become.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.160
Becoming is the main thing.

42:12.160 --> 42:19.540
Now, as far as I am concerned, I am Your Mother.

42:19.540 --> 42:24.670
You have every right on me.

42:24.670 --> 42:29.250
I shouldn’t say I am your guru because I
am only here to connect you to your Self and

42:29.250 --> 42:34.040
you become your own guru.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.790
Once you are connected to the mains you become
your own guru.

42:36.790 --> 42:39.170
You know this Warren Reeves, Dr.

42:39.170 --> 42:40.170
Warren Reeves.

42:40.170 --> 42:48.290
He came to me and I had to stick on to him
because he was all the time running away.

42:48.290 --> 42:54.170
He has been to so many gurus who pampered
his ego –-”Oh, you are a great seeker,”

42:54.170 --> 42:56.470
“You are already a realized soul."

42:56.470 --> 43:03.550
All these things are sticking onto his head
and it was very difficult to get him together.

43:03.550 --> 43:06.330
And also I do not work in the city.

43:06.330 --> 43:10.960
I actually work in the villages of India where
really thousands of people have got realization.

43:10.960 --> 43:14.980
We have seen six thousand people get their
Self realization at a time.

43:14.980 --> 43:23.630
But Indians are wise people and they are the
people who do not indulge into extremes.

43:23.630 --> 43:27.530
In their seeking also they are wise and they
know what to expect.

43:27.530 --> 43:30.790
So, it’s easy for me to work out.

43:30.790 --> 43:36.410
They are innocent people still not exposed
to the material things that you have.

43:36.410 --> 43:39.810
Though you’ve denied it, but you can’t
help it.

43:39.810 --> 43:42.240
Your brain is modern.

43:42.240 --> 43:44.570
You may try to look like primitive people.

43:44.570 --> 43:45.590
The brain is modern.

43:45.590 --> 43:46.730
What can you do?

43:46.730 --> 43:48.950
Think, think, think, think, think.

43:48.950 --> 43:52.710
Just by changing your brain, you do not become
that.

43:52.710 --> 43:54.500
This is the point we should know.

43:54.500 --> 43:59.250
So, it’s easy there to work it out and in
the Indian villages you don’t even get sometimes

43:59.250 --> 44:00.760
a car to move out.

44:00.760 --> 44:07.190
You have to go in a bullock cart and there
is no bathroom, you have to go to the river.

44:07.190 --> 44:11.820
It’s all right for a change or holiday,
but when you have to be with me three months

44:11.820 --> 44:14.070
like that, it was too much for him.

44:14.070 --> 44:20.850
But still he managed and now you will be amazed,
he has established seven centers in seven

44:20.850 --> 44:22.900
cities in Australia.

44:22.900 --> 44:28.900
If you ask him how many people he has given
realization, he will say, “I don’t remember."

44:28.900 --> 44:33.240
So, one light which has been enlightened,
can enlighten another light.

44:33.240 --> 44:36.930
But the first light has to be an enlightened
light.

44:36.930 --> 44:42.300
Once you say that you are enlightened, everybody’s
ego starts coming up.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.740
It’s very common with the Western people.

44:44.740 --> 44:50.280
Every time I went to some place they said,
“Why you of all the things, Mother?”

44:50.280 --> 44:51.760
I said, “It’s all right.

44:51.760 --> 44:54.070
You come along, It’s a good idea.

44:54.070 --> 44:55.760
I would like to retire."

44:55.760 --> 44:59.440
I said, “My husband would pay a man who
can do my job.

44:59.440 --> 45:06.720
It’s a thankless job to work for days and
nights together and he will be very happy

45:06.720 --> 45:27.410
to do that for you."

45:27.410 --> 45:36.560
This problem of becoming is not yours, is
mine for the time being.

45:36.560 --> 45:40.400
When you become that, then it is yours.

45:40.400 --> 45:43.730
Once I know how to swim I can save you.

45:43.730 --> 45:48.480
If I do not know how to swim how can I make
you swim?

45:48.480 --> 45:52.000
When you learn how to swim you can also save
other people.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
It’s very simple.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.860
But even if you say it is saving, people get
frightened.

45:56.860 --> 45:59.810
No, it’s becoming.

45:59.810 --> 46:01.720
It’s what you are.

46:01.720 --> 46:04.640
To get to that is the point.

46:04.640 --> 46:12.510
I would like to tell you what we are and what
is going to happen to us when we become realized

46:12.510 --> 46:13.510
souls.

46:13.510 --> 46:16.280
It’s a gross manifestation of the powers
I told you.

46:16.280 --> 46:22.720
When you became human beings you got your
awareness in a different way than the animals

46:22.720 --> 46:26.130
have, because for the animals, for example,
they do not understand the beauty of this

46:26.130 --> 46:27.130
room.

46:27.130 --> 46:28.130
They won’t.

46:28.130 --> 46:31.650
They don’t understand anything that is filthy
or dirty, they have no smell power.

46:31.650 --> 46:32.650
Somehow they’ve managed.

46:32.650 --> 46:37.920
They can live under any circumstances without
smelling anything.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.060
We don’t have to learn anything from animals.

46:42.060 --> 46:49.210
We are on top of all the creation and we have
to assume our position.

46:49.210 --> 46:57.250
Once you have assumed your position, you become
that and once you become that, then you will

46:57.250 --> 47:00.610
be surprised to see how fantastic you are.

47:00.610 --> 47:03.170
That is the discovery you have to have.

47:03.170 --> 47:08.920
Within ourselves I think all of you got this
unique discovery so it’s easy for you to

47:08.920 --> 47:10.980
see what I’m about to say.

47:10.980 --> 47:16.420
You will be amazed this lecture which I gave
about ten years back in India to begin with

47:16.420 --> 47:18.870
after there have been many lectures.

47:18.870 --> 47:22.660
But if you have this is a good idea.

47:22.660 --> 47:24.570
You can go home and see for yourself.

47:24.570 --> 47:26.730
But you also have a little pamphlet.

47:26.730 --> 47:31.640
On the back side is the complete picture of
the Kundalini.

47:31.640 --> 47:56.480
Now, this is the God, the Primordial Being,
who has made you in His own image.

47:56.480 --> 48:01.940
But still there’s the reflector, the human
being, which is not complete.

48:01.940 --> 48:13.470
Within us lies this subtle mechanism, which
is called the tantra.

48:13.470 --> 48:22.520
This is the real tantra, holy tantra, is an
auspicious thing, which gives us righteousness.

48:22.520 --> 48:28.250
You see, when we think of the tantrikas, they
are the worst of all.

48:28.250 --> 48:32.980
They do all kinds of violence, they teach
all kinds of nonsensical things.

48:32.980 --> 48:36.190
I mean they indulge into any kind of sex.

48:36.190 --> 48:44.110
They use your women, they use your money,
they do all kinds of things.

48:44.110 --> 48:52.760
This is the holy mechanism, this is the pure
mechanism, is the purity, is completely pure

48:52.760 --> 48:55.340
Love, is not biased.

48:55.340 --> 49:09.440
This mechanism exists within you and expresses
itself outside in the gross also to a great

49:09.440 --> 49:10.440
extent.

49:10.440 --> 49:30.030
It expresses itself, on the left-hand side,
as the power of your Desire (iccha shakti).

49:30.030 --> 49:35.590
This expresses itself within us as our emotions,
as our psyche.

49:35.590 --> 49:40.630
Gregoire has rightly said that Freud was quite
half-baked because he knew only one part of

49:40.630 --> 49:45.160
the human being and that, too, was very little
of the psyche.

49:45.160 --> 49:48.220
Because all the scientists see things from
outside in.

49:48.220 --> 49:53.240
If you see a tree from outside, if there is
something wrong with the leaf, you try to

49:53.240 --> 49:54.470
treat the leaf.

49:54.470 --> 49:58.980
But how to treat the whole tree is through
the roots.

49:58.980 --> 50:07.270
So you go to the roots of your being and these
are the roots.

50:07.270 --> 50:16.060
One side of it is the Power of Desire and
it works out after the first center.

50:16.060 --> 50:21.370
I’ll be telling you tomorrow morning about
these centers.

50:21.370 --> 50:29.590
The another power is the power of action,
this yellow color.

50:29.590 --> 50:32.740
It enacts your Desire.

50:32.740 --> 50:37.820
This gives you your future.

50:37.820 --> 50:43.140
You enter into your future by your planning,
by your thinking, for working out.

50:43.140 --> 50:46.720
The left side gives you your past.

50:46.720 --> 50:55.060
It goes on accumulating on the left-hand side
and the deeper you move on the left-hand side

50:55.060 --> 50:57.340
there is the collective subconscious.

50:57.340 --> 51:01.140
First the subconscious and then the collective
subconscious.

51:01.140 --> 51:10.240
Now this is very important to know that when
we indulge too much into the left subconscious,

51:10.240 --> 51:16.450
that is a very dangerous situation, as well
as if you move into your right-hand side is

51:16.450 --> 51:24.600
the supra conscious and then to the collective
supraconscious, is also a very dangerous situation.

51:24.600 --> 51:32.040
Moving into the left and the right is the
easy thing for human beings to do because

51:32.040 --> 51:39.900
if you want to do something, if you try to
do something about it and if you are not spontaneous,

51:39.900 --> 51:42.740
what happens?

51:42.740 --> 51:49.620
Your sympathetic nervous system, which is
governed by this subtle energy, goes into

51:49.620 --> 51:54.720
action and you either move into the left side
or into the right side.

51:54.720 --> 52:01.730
For example, if you want to run, as these
days many people are just running, (You can

52:01.730 --> 52:04.900
run once in a while, but all the time running
– what is the need?

52:04.900 --> 52:07.090
Human beings are delicate things.

52:07.090 --> 52:13.670
The way we go headlong into everything like
a bull in a china shop is not necessary.

52:13.670 --> 52:19.360
The way you ruin yourself also, because you
think this body is your own, do what you like.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.290
You must respect your body.

52:21.290 --> 52:28.190
This is the Temple of God.) So, when you start
overdoing something on the left or the right

52:28.190 --> 52:33.750
side, say some people are crying, weeping,
singing praise of death and all that, so have

52:33.750 --> 52:34.750
it.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.970
Some people say we must suffer.

52:36.970 --> 52:40.090
Alright, then you suffer, have Hitler on top
of your head.

52:40.090 --> 52:45.040
If you want more, you can have them, any number.

52:45.040 --> 52:54.270
There are already so many coming to make you
suffer.

52:54.270 --> 52:56.040
There is no need for you to suffer.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.610
Somebody has suffered for you, once and for
all.

52:57.610 --> 53:01.680
You are just ready to enter into the Kingdom
of God.

53:01.680 --> 53:07.450
If you try to go too much on the left-hand
side or too much on the right-hand side, you

53:07.450 --> 53:10.690
feel that you have gone into a new world.

53:10.690 --> 53:12.150
You have not.

53:12.150 --> 53:21.240
For example, take a simple thing like LSD.

53:21.240 --> 53:25.310
When you take LSD, you move to the right side.

53:25.310 --> 53:28.040
You start seeing the eyes and all that.

53:28.040 --> 53:35.360
Actually, you put your Ego to the right-hand
side and you start seeing that and once you

53:35.360 --> 53:39.350
see that you do not become anything, you just
see it.

53:39.350 --> 53:43.760
Seeing it is not becoming, you have to become.

53:43.760 --> 53:47.030
And once you start seeing it, you think you
have become a higher personality.

53:47.030 --> 53:48.030
It’s absolutely wrong.

53:48.030 --> 53:57.340
You are under the control of something else.

53:57.340 --> 54:00.140
You are not yourself.

54:00.140 --> 54:09.300
The last word on the collective supraconscious
was Hitler.

54:09.300 --> 54:13.730
He got lost completely.

54:13.730 --> 54:22.660
He was using tantrikas, these horrible people,
and he was using all that knowledge, so called,

54:22.660 --> 54:23.880
how to use these forces.

54:23.880 --> 54:30.870
The forces come to you through dead spirits
who are very powerful in their lifetime, and

54:30.870 --> 54:39.300
those who are not, give up that idea of domination
and they are on this earth still all around.

54:39.300 --> 54:44.210
The left-sided people are the people who indulge
into other kind of things like-alcohols and

54:44.210 --> 54:51.860
ganjas and all these things, by which you
become sort of all the time crying, weeping,

54:51.860 --> 54:52.860
this, that.

54:52.860 --> 54:57.480
In that you see your past.

54:57.480 --> 55:02.550
Is a good idea in a way, but a bad idea also
in a way, because you are in the present,

55:02.550 --> 55:04.210
not in your past.

55:04.210 --> 55:08.680
Past does not exist any more, it’s finished
now.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.160
What exists is the present.

55:11.160 --> 55:16.570
Either you are in the future or in the past
and when you go too much into it you get identified

55:16.570 --> 55:19.860
and you think this is what is the Truth, which
is not.

55:19.860 --> 55:24.160
I have to tell you that it is not.

55:24.160 --> 55:29.530
What is the Truth is your Spirit.

55:29.530 --> 55:36.480
Your evolutionary process has to trigger it
and that’s how you become.

55:36.480 --> 55:38.390
By becoming that what happens to you?

55:38.390 --> 55:40.320
You don’t start jumping like mad.

55:40.320 --> 55:41.420
No, it’s not.

55:41.420 --> 55:42.420
Anybody can jump.

55:42.420 --> 55:45.180
Is it difficult to jump?

55:45.180 --> 55:48.010
Some people who said that we went for a flying
course.

55:48.010 --> 55:51.140
They paid 3000 Pounds to fly.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.140
What is the need?

55:52.140 --> 55:55.670
You don’t want to become birds or frogs,
do you?

55:55.670 --> 55:59.220
And they were nothing but frogs jumping.

55:59.220 --> 56:00.850
In my presence they were jumping like that.

56:00.850 --> 56:03.210
I didn’t know how to control.

56:03.210 --> 56:09.210
And they paid 3000 pounds for this.

56:09.210 --> 56:13.180
The other day in a plane I had somebody from
that kind of a thing was sitting and he was

56:13.180 --> 56:15.310
all the time doing like this because I was
sitting behind him.

56:15.310 --> 56:19.440
I said, ”I think I better get out from there
and go out the back."

56:19.440 --> 56:21.150
You are not in your own control.

56:21.150 --> 56:23.050
You have to be your own master.

56:23.050 --> 56:29.950
Now you must know this, that you should be
able to control yourself is the main point.

56:29.950 --> 56:32.750
Like in a car, there are these two powers.

56:32.750 --> 56:39.630
One is the brake and the other is the accelerator.

56:39.630 --> 56:42.860
First, you don’t know how to drive.

56:42.860 --> 56:48.390
You are sitting and first you are going into
a ditch, then sometimes you are getting out

56:48.390 --> 56:52.270
trying to balance it, then you know how to
drive.

56:52.270 --> 56:54.770
When do you know?

56:54.770 --> 56:56.570
When you know.

56:56.570 --> 56:59.640
If you ask me, “Mother, when do we know
how to drive?” When we know.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.630
It is an amazingly simple thing.

57:01.630 --> 57:04.130
So, now you have managed both these.

57:04.130 --> 57:08.270
First, you’ve made accident and have done
all mistakes, doesn’t matter.

57:08.270 --> 57:11.750
As long as you learn how to drive, finished.

57:11.750 --> 57:19.720
First you have a driving license, then you
start arranging these two things to keep yourself

57:19.720 --> 57:20.720
into balance.

57:20.720 --> 57:26.690
You come into balance, still you are not the
master of the car, but you are master as far

57:26.690 --> 57:28.690
as the mechanism is concerned.

57:28.690 --> 57:36.160
So, there is a master who is sitting, of the
car and of you.

57:36.160 --> 57:40.980
In the beginning you should be master of your
body, master of everything.

57:40.980 --> 57:49.590
Then, what happens, that you become the master
of the car as well.

57:49.590 --> 57:54.210
First you balance yourself in such a way that
you know how to master your body, your mind

57:54.210 --> 57:55.700
and everything.

57:55.700 --> 58:00.530
And then you become that by which you can
master other people also.

58:00.530 --> 58:02.450
But mastery does not mean domination.

58:02.450 --> 58:03.980
It’s Love.

58:03.980 --> 58:08.260
It’s a wrong idea that a master is a person
who dominates.

58:08.260 --> 58:10.440
It comes from where I don’t know.

58:10.440 --> 58:13.210
Master is the one who loves, who really does.

58:13.210 --> 58:20.800
He may just sometimes tell you don’t do
this because it’s wrong, the whole bad things

58:20.800 --> 58:23.170
happening, he may tell you.

58:23.170 --> 58:26.220
But he is a comforter.

58:26.220 --> 58:29.460
Comforter, because you have felt no Love in
your life.

58:29.460 --> 58:32.050
The real Love you have not felt.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.230
You want some place where you can get that
Love.

58:34.230 --> 58:37.520
He is a comforter, is the left side.

58:37.520 --> 58:43.180
In our Sahaja Yoga language we call the Comforter
as Mahakali.

58:43.180 --> 58:46.280
She is the Holy Ghost.

58:46.280 --> 58:50.490
From that Comforter other aspects come up.

58:50.490 --> 59:00.310
The second aspect is what you call the Councelor,
The one who tells you what is what, decodes

59:00.310 --> 59:03.610
everything, tells you how to manage, how to
go ahead.

59:03.610 --> 59:07.830
Like an instructor and you verify that.

59:07.830 --> 59:17.500
The second one in our Sahaja Yoga is called
Mahasaraswati and the third one is the Redeemer,

59:17.500 --> 59:31.180
the one who who gives you moksha, through
the Sushumna nadi, is called as Mahalaxmi.

59:31.180 --> 59:34.340
These are the three powers which exist within
us.

59:34.340 --> 59:43.000
The first manifests the left sympathetic,
the second one manifests the right sympathetic

59:43.000 --> 59:53.110
and the third one gives you the parasympathetic
which controls these two centers, which coordinates,

59:53.110 --> 59:55.540
cooperates and refills.

59:55.540 --> 01:00:01.360
But it is still a limited amount of energy.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.280
Some people tell me that they went to a person
and felt the energy.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.780
What sort of an energy were you feeling?

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.560
Very much like shaking and all that.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.280
No, that’s not good.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.240
If you are not possessed you should not shake
before a person.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:26.220
On the contrary you start feeling the cool
breeze in the hands.You feel completely relaxed.

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.990
How do you know?

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:31.450
What happens through Sahaja Yoga is the way,
is very good.

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.100
You should see for yourself.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:44.310
Get three people – one from a lunatic asylum,
certified mad; get another one who is not

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:49.950
realized; get the third one who is realized.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.160
They sit down.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.320
Now you ask them to put their hands towards
you.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.410
Now the person who is lunatic will be doing
like this.

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:08.710
Now if there a cancer patient, he will be
emitting tremendous heat, so much so that

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:17.840
you don’t need a heater, even in London
in December or January.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.690
But supposing that person is just a normal,
balanced person, is in the center.

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:30.210
He starts feeling the cool breeze and the
realized soul starts feeling the whole thing

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.770
coming on.

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:39.100
This is what you have to judge with people
when they come.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:43.050
You should know what happens to them.

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:50.330
If you are seeking reality, you must know
that you have to face yourself as you are

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.330
today.

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:59.670
You need not try to hide anything, because
there is nothing to be hidden from your mother.

01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:01.140
I don’t care whatever you have done.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.950
I just don’t bother.

01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:04.500
It’s not necessary.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:10.850
The first mantra in Sahaja Yoga to be said
is that Mother, I am not guilty.

01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:14.430
You have to say that 16 times in your heart.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:26.300
This is the first mantra of Sahaja Yoga, because
in yourself whole things have crawled up into

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.900
a diffidence in life.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.000
Even the Ego sometimes gets hurt.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.250
When you do mistakes or anything, it gets
hurt and when it gets hurt you get diffident,

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.980
and it gets built up within you.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:46.830
When you say, “Mother, I am not guilty,”
your self-esteem is established.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:52.910
First day you’d better establish your self-esteem.

01:02:52.910 --> 01:03:01.570
Within you lies this power of Kundalini.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:06.380
I was very happy to know that people have
reached the conclusion that it is the Kundalini

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.010
awakening which is going to do the job.

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:13.110
It is a very good conclusion you have reached.

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:19.390
But any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot do it,
one should know that.

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:24.830
Saying it is a sprouting, it’s a living
process.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:28.190
Now, logically you should approach the subject.

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:31.980
You are all very intelligent people, I can
see that.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.390
Living things, like sprouting the seed.

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:39.240
If you want to sprout a seed, can you pull
it out?

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:45.360
Or if you stand on your head, will it happen?

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.230
They are such sweet things.

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:49.230
“Hello.

01:03:49.230 --> 01:04:03.110
Alright now, sit down for a while."

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:04.330
They are realized souls.

01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:06.430
They are born realized.

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:10.400
So many children are born realized and if
you are not realized [UNCLEAR parents] you

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.220
are going to harm them.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:18.060
You have to know what are they.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:24.000
They know me better than you people do and
they are going to come up.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.530
Wait for ten years before.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:32.940
They are going to create that great, beautiful
mansion of Love for you.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:39.860
So, this Kundalini is the power within us.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:45.850
What power is this?

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:55.770
This is the power of Primordial Desire within
us to be one with the Divine, to be united

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.850
with the Divine and this is the Yoga.

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.360
All the rest of it is not.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:08.040
As you are, you are to be connected with the
Divine, is the Yoga.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.850
If that is so, this desire is not yet manifested.

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:20.310
So, it is called as a sleeping Kundalini and
only the person who has that warmth of the

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:25.830
Mother Earth can do it, as simple as that.

01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:36.720
Everyone who thinks that Kundalini is to be
awakened must know it is a spontaneous, living

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.600
happening, just like a sprouting of a seed.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.240
You cannot just pull it out.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.240
It cannot be done by any effort.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.410
It’s spontaneous.

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:53.700
If it is evolutionary, logically we can find
out that we did nothing to become human beings

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.300
from amoeba stage.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:06:02.080
We didn’t cut our tails to become human
beings, did we?

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.040
We didn’t do anything.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.590
It has happened so spontaneously.

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:13.330
But where is the change in us, let’s see
again logically.

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:15.430
Not rationally, but logically.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.990
Rationality could be quite mad.

01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:26.200
Logically you should understand, what is the
difference we have got is in our awareness.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.400
Something has to happen in awareness, not
in a way that you just start jumping or taking

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.480
out your clothes and doing nonsensical things.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.690
It’s very easy.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:41.220
In the bathroom everybody does it.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.280
What’s so great?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.350
But just understand.

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:53.340
You can see with your naked eye the pulsation
of the Kundalini.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.350
If you are a first class instrument, it just
happens.

01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:59.540
Like a jet it goes.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.490
It’s a jet Kundalini in the jet age.

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:09.750
It has to happen to all of you.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:14.890
Why some people said you have to do so much
and you have to do like this and you have

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:20.790
to do that and you have to cleanse yourself
and then only you’ll get realization.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.590
Why is it so simple today?

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:27.820
The reason is the time has come.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:34.660
In the beginning of a tree’s life one or
two flowers come in, but now the blossom time

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:41.950
has come, so many seekers I see before me,
just like flowers about to become the fruits.

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:44.350
There were never so much seekers before.

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:50.590
Whatever you can say against the modern times
this is the outcome of that.

01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:54.630
Without this chaos there would have been not
so many.

01:07:54.630 --> 01:08:00.450
This is the time that he predicted that many
saints will be born at this time.

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:02.450
[UNCLEAR] imagine thousands of years back
it was written.

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:10.750
When this Kali Yuga, this modern time, the
one who created the Kali, he was caught up

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:16.210
by somebody and he said, “Nala, what do
mean by torturing me and my wife like this.

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:18.450
I am going to kill you.

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:24.820
The Kali said, “Alright, you can kill me,
but you have to find out one thing about me.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.600
You must know what I am and what I represent."

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.600
“What are you?

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.600
Just tell me."

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:35.860
He said: “When the modern times will come,”
we call it as Kali Yuga, “at this time,

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:41.750
these saints who are seeking God in the hills
and dales and in the Himalayas will be born

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:49.540
as ordinary householders and they are going
to receive the blessings.

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.230
It’s already promised."

01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:54.600
If so, that happening has to take place.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:02.770
But as soon as people came to know that people
are seeking, the market got jammed.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:06.480
and you got into the trap.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:17.340
It’s a very subtle method of making money
out of you.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:24.770
Now, I think, most of them are getting a little
worried, because all their advertising and

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:30.720
all that is a little bit fading and they don’t
know how to find out new methods of advertising

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.790
to get ‘round you.

01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:36.480
These people are not interested in Indian
villages.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:44.010
They are interested in Los Angeles or in Santa
Cruz where they can extract money.

01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:48.990
It is an enterprise.

01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:52.090
You cannot sell God, can you?

01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:54.480
You cannot organize it.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:02.840
Some lady paid $4000 very recently and I heard
somebody told me that she went there, she

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.050
danced, she took out her clothes, became mad
and came back.

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:11.480
You pay to go to lunatic asylum or what?

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.390
But it helps you to go there because there’s
a fashion on.

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:23.070
Everybody is going, “Oh, I’ve been there
to that Guru."

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:26.430
It’s so maddening.

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:30.410
You must understand, you are the new forms
of the old ways.

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:38.050
In olden days, people who could donate for
a church were regarded as very religious.

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:51.660
Even now, I think, some of the Jews, they
have a diamond-jeweled bible and if they can

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:58.660
tithe there they show it nicely that they
have got one.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:05.320
All these false ideas of God you’d better
give up, because you are not followers, you

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.320
are seekers.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.930
Let them go on with that nonsense.

01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:13.740
But you are seekers, so you take to the Truth
and you become that.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.070
I think today, it’s quite a lot for you.

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:20.990
I would like you to ask me some questions,
but sensible questions and don’t be aggressive

01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.990
with me.

01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.990
I am very clever.

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:26.100
As they told him, “She’s a masterpiece
of camouflage."

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.790
It’s true, I am, so be careful.

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.760
If you have any real questions ask me.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:38.350
If you are not a true seeker and you are just
trying to show off, you are cheating yourself.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:39.520
Don’t try to show off.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.740
“I read this book."

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.740
“I read that book."

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.740
“This happened."

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.490
”What do you think of this Guru?” Don’t
bring me to controversies.

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:46.490
It’s unnecessary.

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:50.140
If they were of any value, you would have
been a realized soul.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:55.020
I can make out from you who was your Guru
the way they have ruined your Kundalini.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.900
Some of the Kundalinis are so ruined.

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:10.020
I see them just like wounded snakes, tossing
their heads like this.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.750
It is so bleedy.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:14.780
You don’t know how much they’ve corrupted
you.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.780
Don’t ask me about these cruel people.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:22.740
If I start blasting them, you’ll be amazed
how they are.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:27.180
I love you very much, but I don’t love them.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:33.250
I am wrathful, very angry with them, because
they are devils, satanic.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:36.380
If they wanted money, they could have smuggled.

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:42.680
They could have done something like that,
but they should not have ruined your Kundalini.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.920
They had no business to do it.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:52.510
They will go to hell, no doubt, but they’ll
be carrying so many with them, they know that.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.810
They are trying to overpower.

01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:56.530
They are Anti-Christ.

01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:59.760
They think they can win over God.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:07.830
Let them know that God’s Powers are so powerful
that they can all be destroyed like this in

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:08.830
one stroke.

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:14.480
The only thing why they are not destroyed
is because today they are in your brains.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:25.350
Krishna has said,”Whenever there is the
fall of Dharma, fall of your values, your

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:33.910
virtues, whenever the saints suffer, I come
on this Earth to save the Saints and kill

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.170
the devils."

01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:38.880
But the devils have gone into the Saints now.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.780
It’s a problem, a dilemma for me.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.780
What to do.

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.320
These devils have come into your brains.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.840
They are to be taken out, first of all.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.630
Just wait for me to finish.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:52.500
Do not stick on to one question.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.260
If you stick on, you’ll miss the whole point.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.220
By questioning, you will not get Realization.

01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.890
It’s not a mental activity.

01:13:59.890 --> 01:14:03.080
It’s triggering beyond the mental activity.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.250
This lecture is useless if you do not get
your Realization.

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:11.260
In the beginning of the Vedas it was written
that if you do not get the knowledge… Knowledge

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.570
doesn’t mean going mad.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:15.180
It doesn’t mean hypnosis.

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:18.990
But if you do not feel the all pervading Power,
then these Vedas are useless.

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:24.610
In the same way my lecture and all mental
activities are useless if you do not get your

01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:25.610
Realization.

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:27.890
That’s the main thing you must have.

01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:34.760
May God bless you.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:43.360
Now, ask me a question.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:49.450
Seeker: What is the best approach we can take
to go to Laxmi?

01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:54.410
Shri Mataji: I will tell you tomorrow about
Laxmi, where she is settled down.

01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:57.540
That’s what we are going to do, all the
Goddess, not one.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.580
All in one bundle.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:07.140
Now what do you say to that?

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:14.050
Alright, good idea.

01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:24.810
Seeker: Asks about how to deal with her worries.

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:25.820
Alright, doesn’t matter.

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:30.250
We are going to work it out.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:32.590
Don’t worry about your personal things.

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:45.740
It’s all
going to work out en masse.

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.940
Dr.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:52.830
Warren: She is asking whether you said to
say, “Mother, I am not guilty”.

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:55.900
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, please, within yourself.

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:56.900
Very important.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.900
What is it?

01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.900
Dr.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:15:59.900
Warren:She is liking it!

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:01.450
Shri Mataji: Good, good.

01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:03.150
May God bless you.

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:05.260
Don’t feel guilty at all.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.550
Otherwise I would not come here.

01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:14.770
The ones who have harmed you are guilty.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:32.230
Seeker: What is your capacity and our capacity
to hate the devils.

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:34.710
Most religions preached that we should not
be angry.

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:40.300
Shri Mataji: You should not be angry, but
with Devils?

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.930
You run away from them.

01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:45.930
Let me handle them.

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:46.930
You just don’t worry about them.

01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:47.930
It’s my job.

01:16:47.930 --> 01:17:07.480
First of all you love yourself, have self-esteem,
know that you are the temple of God, Then

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.880
you love by becoming realized, you become
collectively conscious.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.790
Again the word becoming.

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:16.170
Then you start feeling the other within yourself.

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:17.170
Who is the other?

01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:20.390
I am not helping you, you are part and parcel
of my being.

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:25.130
If I am helping my finger, am I helping you?

01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:33.140
Then we see about the rest of the thing.

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:50.710
You don’t worry about them.

01:17:50.710 --> 01:18:00.130
Seeker: Many of the people who come to my
clinic have activated their Kundalini too

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:02.780
early and I’m wondering how to help them.

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:12.480
Shri Mataji: They do not activate their Kundalini,
they do not.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.070
All these things are just to activate the
sympathetic and it’s very dangerous.

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:20.660
You can get blisters, you can get all kinds
of problems.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:24.310
You can get cancer also.

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:26.200
I get so many people like that.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.490
I’ll make you the masters.

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:31.740
It’s Love.

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.900
It cannot harm.

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.500
It’s your Mother.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.420
That’s the only Mother you have and you
are the only child.

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.730
How can your Kundalini trouble you?

01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:46.150
She is just waiting for the moment to give
you realization.

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:57.320
She loves you the most of all.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:05.380
And you cannot activate it, it just spontaneously
rises.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.780
I was myself amazed to read some books on
Kundalini.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:12.060
I said these people don’t know what Kundalini
is.

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.360
They’re liars.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:20.270
They are cheats writing such big books about
Kundalini without knowing a word, without

01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:21.480
having any authority.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.550
You have to have Divine Authority, isn’t
it?

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:27.220
You cannot get it in a Theological college
or any place you go to.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:34.960
Its a Divine Authority you must have.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.310
Seeker: Should we love our enemies as well?

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:43.220
Shri Mataji: First of all you love yourself
and your friends.

01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:51.500
Then we can talk of enemies.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.780
You have to know who are your enemies.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:57.490
Actually, you don’t know who are your enemies.

01:19:57.490 --> 01:20:03.790
First, we have to develop that discretion
power.

01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:07.820
By your vibrations you will know who is who,
because once you are connected with the mains,

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.680
you start feeling it.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.680
You can ask any question whichever is an absolute
question.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.300
You can ask is there God?

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.440
You will start feeling a cool breeze coming
in.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.930
Like a computer, you become connected with
the mains and you answer all these questions.

01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:32.310
You develop your discretion and you will know
who are yours and who are not yours.

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:39.910
Before that you don’t know, you are so mixed
up.

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:49.970
Actually there are very few enemies that you
have, very few.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:52.680
Should we now have it?

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:57.780
You’ve got that door open there.

01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:04.470
Just get one of the doors open for some of
the enemies to fly out.

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:07.960
Dr.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:16.280
Warren: If anyone has their shoes on, take
them off and simply put your hands out towards

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:23.340
Mataji as if asking for it.

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.490
Be humble about it.

01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:25.490
Be open-minded.

01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:28.230
If you’ve got a lot of questions…

01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:29.900
Shri Mataji: Sit comfortably.

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.320
There is nothing to put yourself to stay.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.130
Your neck should be bending neither forward
nor backward.

01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:39.430
There is no effort to be put in.

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:40.430
Just sit comfortably.

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:43.430
Kundalini will rise by itself and you’ll
get your Realization.

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:45.470
You don’t have to do anything.

01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:48.880
Just don’t put your concentration onto one
point.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:51.670
Some people have a habit of concentrating
here, concentrating there.

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:56.590
All those people who have done this concentration
business or, what is that the another one,

01:21:56.590 --> 01:22:00.210
putting the tongue back?

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:03.630
(kechari mudra).

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:12.140
Whatever you have done, all such people should
put their attention here (top of head).

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.690
There is the door, not here.

01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:14.710
That’s all.

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:24.000
But rest of the people just keep your attention
absolutely loose.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.010
Now, close your eyes.

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:35.360
Keep your eyes closed, because Kundalini has
to pass through Agnya chakra and if your eyes

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.290
are not closed, she won’t rise.

01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:43.010
Put your hands towards me just like this.

01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:48.490
All of you, please put your hands, because
in the hands you have those centers.

01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:51.760
I would request you to take out if there is
anything heavy in your necks.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.000
Please, take off.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.240
It is better.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.580
Also, if there is anything heavy or tight
on your waist.

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:09.050
You can loosen your belt a little bit.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:27.600
Just put your hands towards me.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:36.880
Close your eyes.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:24:02.160
Please, put your right hand on your heart,
because Spirit resides in our heart.

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:06.840
Sit very comfortably without any strain on
your back.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.320
That is very important.

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:35.020
First of all, you have to ask in your heart,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Not dead spirit but Atma.
