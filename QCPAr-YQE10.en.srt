The Beauty That You 

2
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Are
October 5, 1981

3
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Public Program, Houston, Texas, USA

4
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:14,180
Yesterday I told you that God has created
us with a purpose and unless and until we

5
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,490
find out our purpose, unless and until we
find out our absolute, we are going to seek

6
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:36,490
and we are not going to be happy. He has done
everything, very beautifully. Now we should

7
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,620
understand what are we really, inside.

8
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,620
Moreover, as I explained to you yesterday,
that whatever I say is to be taken as a hypothesis,

9
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,720
as a scientist who would keep his mind open
and see for himself, because everything is

10
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,720
not known to you. And whatever I say, you
have to keep your mind open, you need not

11
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,970
accept Me blindly because blind faith is of
no use. But, if you get your enlightenment,

12
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:19,620
you get your Self-realization, you actualize
it, you become, then you have to verify for

13
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,770
yourself whatever I say, is it true or not?

14
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,770
For example, if I say that the Christ, our
Lord, is placed in this center of ours, at

15
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,700
the Agnya Chakra, which I’ll explain to
you in details. You are not to believe Me

16
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:46,700
that He’s placed there, but you have to
see for yourself when you get your realization,

17
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,910
you will be able to raise the Kundalini of
other people. And when you start raising the

18
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,570
Kundalini you will find that it will stop
at this point – because you will become

19
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:04,570
your own gurus, the Kundalini will move at
your fingers, and then when you find the Kundalini

20
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,900
has stopped here you’ll be amazed that you
will have to ask the seeker or the subject

21
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,130
to say the Lord’s Prayer. And that’s the
only way you can get out the Kundalini from

22
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:28,130
that center. It’s a mantra. It’s a mantra,
it’s a chanting, which was given to us.

23
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,740
He could have given the bija mantra, the seed
of that chanting is Ham-ksham. But, He didn’t

24
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,520
give because He thought people would be, specially
Christians would be very rational people,

25
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,100
so He thought better give a complete explanation
of the whole thing. But every word of it is

26
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,100
a mantra. But it is to be awakened; if it
is not awakened, it’s dead. It is to be

27
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,570
awakened, this is the basis of Sahaj Yoga.

28
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,349
“Saha” is “born.” With you, Saha-ja.
“Ja” means “born” and “Saha” is

29
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,180
“with” – is born with you, spontaneous,
it’s living process within you, is your

30
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,890
own right, you must have it.

31
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,890
So this is a living process and the living
happening should take place. You should become

32
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,220
your absolute; you should become your own
guru; you should get complete integration

33
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,690
within yourself; and then you will be able
to discriminate because the all-pervading

34
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,690
Power, about which I told you yesterday, is
surrounding, is everywhere, only you are to

35
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,840
be awakened; once you are awakened you can
start feeling them, the existence of that,

36
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:53,060
around you, on your fingers. Imagine on your
fingers you start feeling that Cool Breeze

37
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:01,850
of the Holy Ghost. That should happen to all
of us and the time has come, the blossom time

38
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,280
has come and thousands must get their realization.

39
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,380
With this today I would explain to you the
different centers we have within ourselves

40
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,270
and the chakras that are within us. I was
amazed, in New York they said that people

41
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,590
are taking lot of money for this chakra therapy,
I mean I just can’t understand what they

42
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:31,220
do about it, but all those who came from this
chakra therapies, had all their chakras ruined

43
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,360
completely. I mean, you pay to ruin your chakras,
I just couldn’t understand. Anybody coming

44
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,240
from India is not a saint, on the contrary,
as I told you, there could be greatest thuggery

45
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,240
in India. Yes. They are very intelligent,
cunning people, they can be very good. If

46
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,400
they are good, they are very, very good and
if they are bad, they are horrid.

47
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,940
So you have to be careful when you think of
an Indian that, as we cannot say that all

48
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,290
Americans are Mr. Ford, in the same way Indians
also, you must know how to discriminate. First

49
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:19,150
of all your discrimination power must come,
otherwise you won’t be able to make out

50
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:26,150
who is the real, who is not the real. That
must happen to you. Unless and until that

51
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,740
happens the rest of it is, is of no use, because
as I said this room is dark and your eyes

52
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,360
are closed, when you come inside you see nothing
but darkness and I start telling you, “this

53
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,620
is this, this is this and I tell you there’s
one elephant you can’t see here and there’s

54
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:49,250
one tiger sitting here,” you just believe
it. And there’s nothing like that here.

55
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,340
And you people are definitely much more honest
that you can’t believe how people could

56
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,960
be such fake. Oh, there can be fake people
all over the world.

57
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I am ashamed of it sometimes when I see that
in the great country of yoga, where such great

58
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:17,250
incarnations came in, such great work of the
saints has been done, horrible people also

59
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:26,020
are born in the same place because that’s
the place they want to harm, they want to

60
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:34,400
attack. They are negative, not only negative
but they are very, very dangerous. I may tell

61
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,110
about them tomorrow or day after, but today
I want to tell you about the good things that

62
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,229
you are. The beauty that you are and how beautifully
you are made within yourself.

63
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:51,229
So within us, as I told you, lies this residual
power called as Kundalini. This is the part

64
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,920
of the all-pervading Power which thinks, which
understands, which coordinates, which loves.

65
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:06,350
Is the integration of all these powers within
us, as this Kundalini. Now so many books have

66
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:16,300
been written about Kundalini. When I read
them I was shocked that how could people write

67
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,300
books about Kundalini without understanding
what it meant, without understanding where

68
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,130
it was. Such big books have been written on
Kundalini, which says, “The Kundalini is

69
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,690
in the stomach, some say this Kundalini’s
in the nose. I don’t know how could people

70
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,600
write, I mean it takes nothing for them to
write something and to publish, and they are

71
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,600
not afraid of God that they are writing all
these nonsensical things without understanding

72
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,750
it.

73
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:51,750
So this is the Kundalini that is placed in
the sacrum bone. Now this bone, even in English

74
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,300
is called as sacrum, this word comes from
Greece as I told you that Greek people knew

75
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,300
about Kundalini. Sacrum means sacred. This
bone is a sacred bone. And why is it a sacred

76
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,470
bone because the Kundalini, the primordial
desire within us to be one with the Divine,

77
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,970
is still unmanifested and sleeping, and is
the safest place where it has to be.

78
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:19,970
Now you are paying attention to Me, now if
I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

79
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,530
You may say, “I’m paying attention,”
but you cannot, you cannot take your attention

80
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,890
inside. But if there is some happening within
you, then your attention is drawn inside,

81
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:40,890
so it is built like this that at a human level
this happening will take place of sprouting.

82
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:48,579
And when this sprouting takes place, then
your attention is pulled inside. This attention

83
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:54,059
has gone out because of the prismatic, as
you say the prism here, prismatic action of

84
00:10:54,059 --> 00:11:01,059
the brain of a human being. I will not go
into the details of it, but there is a big

85
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,199
science about that: why our attention is outside
all the time.

86
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:14,010
Now below the Kundalini, which is three-and-a-half
coils, is placed a very important center of

87
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:21,010
innocence, is the center of innocence. The
first thing that was emitted out of the all-pervading

88
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:27,760
Power was, it had the form, I should say the
all-pervading Power was nothing but just innocence,

89
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,760
which is the most powerful thing in this world,
is your innocence. And this innocence is placed

90
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:43,610
below the Kundalini, and is adorned by the
deity called as Shri Ganesha, who has a trunk

91
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:52,089
like an elephant. This is the bija; this is
the seed of Christ. This forms the seed, and

92
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,839
then He incarnated on this earth, this is
the subtle form, on this earth as Mahavishnu

93
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:05,839
– is written down in the Devi Purana – or
we call Him as Christ. The name Christ and

94
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:12,870
His name Jesus also has a very big meaning
and relates to something that happened before

95
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,079
Him.

96
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:21,079
Now this great incarnation of Christ came
on this earth, which was nothing but innocence,

97
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:29,030
innocence itself took the form and it was
the all-pervading Power itself which took

98
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:37,079
the form and came on this earth. That’s
why this is a very important center, is the

99
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:45,510
beginning. Because it is innocence, is like
a lotus and it is placed at a point where

100
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,750
the gate to hell are open within us. This
center gives rise in the gross … Now this

101
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:01,110
is a subtle center called as Mooladhara Chakra.
Chakra Mooladhara. Mooladhara means the support

102
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,920
of the root. Now root is the Kundalini. It
is the support of the root. Kundalini is the

103
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,370
Mother, and this is your innocence, this is
your childhood and that’s the Mother. And

104
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,370
the Mother is there to give you your realization,
waiting all the time, She is your own individual

105
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,370
Mother, and She is just waiting, ages together,
to give you the experience of Self-realization,

106
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,780
to give you your second birth.

107
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:39,780
Now the last center looks after, in the gross,
the Pelvic Plexus, which you have heard of,

108
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:48,319
which has also got four sub-plexuses, this
has also got four petals as we call it. There

109
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:57,640
are four petals. So this center looks after
the pelvic plexus in the gross, which looks

110
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:04,860
after the excretion. This center we must consider
at length, a little bit, which is very important

111
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:13,420
to understand that this also looks after the
sex and reproduction, mainly the sex and other

112
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:20,420
excretions. Now you can see here that it is
placed below the Kundalini. That means sex

113
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:30,319
does not play any part in your evolution.
It does not. Those people who say that sex

114
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:37,319
has something to do with Kundalini, are really
blasphemous and very ugly people because you

115
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:45,780
cannot put sex to your Mother. It’s something,
even today is not accepted, when people have

116
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:53,230
become so much lenient about sex, is not accepted.
And this is what it is when people talk of

117
00:14:53,569 --> 00:15:00,510
sex and Kundalini together. As a Mother, I
give them a little chance or sort of a little

118
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:07,510
grace because to say that they originated
all this from deliberate action will be too

119
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:13,500
much. I would say that maybe they when they
were meditating, at the sex point they might

120
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,540
have seen Ganesha’s trunk which they might
have thought to be the Kundalini. Possibly

121
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,709
that’s how they went into a wrong situation.
But of course it’s a very wrong thing.

122
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:30,709
We have had cases in New York and here also
where the private parts of people were touched

123
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:39,089
by some of the people, and are having a very
bad time with that action. It’s your private.

124
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:47,130
It has nothing to do with sex. Animals are
more sex-conscious than you are; are they

125
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:55,329
going to get evolution before you get? Moreover,
the whole thing that is worked out in such

126
00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:02,299
a way that we have started having the sex
through our mental activity, which is a wrong

127
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:08,520
thing. Christ has said, “Thou shalt not
have adultery, thy should not commit adultery.

128
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:15,520
But I say, I say verily to you, ‘Thou shalt
not have adulterous eyes.’ Because He knew

129
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:24,030
this would happen one day that the sex would
move from there to the Swadisthana Chakra

130
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:31,140
– the second chakra by which we think – and
then it will come into our thinking and our

131
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:38,140
eyes will start roving around. And then, actually
the sex act minimizes, and it becomes a big

132
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,480
problem; I mean to be a sex point itself becomes
an achievement for people then. It’s such

133
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,480
an absurd thing to do. And this is what is
a very big confusion today in the modern times.

134
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,459
I mean, you cannot make compromises with Christ;
what He said is absolute. But unless and until

135
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:06,459
you understand that sex as a married life,
as a private thing, is the one that has been

136
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:16,169
sanctioned for our sustenance, for our sustenance
as human beings; that has to be looked after,

137
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,380
is to be respected, is sacred. And that’s
why anything else that we try to do, all kinds

138
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,890
of perversions and these things – you won’t
believe that all kinds of perversions come

139
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,830
to us because we are no more there. Mostly
we get possessed.

140
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:45,830
We had one boy who came to us in New York
and he told me, “Mother, I… I’m a man,

141
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,799
I have moustaches and everything but I want
to be like a woman. I want to be dressed up

142
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,410
like a woman,” and he talked like a woman.
He said, “I want to walk like a woman, I

143
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,730
don’t know what to do with myself. I am
so confused. And I cannot have any relationship

144
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,110
with any woman because she gets confused with
me also. And I don’t know what is happening

145
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:13,110
to me, why I want to be like this.” And
I could see he was possessed by a woman. He

146
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,620
was just possessed by a woman, simple thing
as that. Very simple, it is extremely simple.

147
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:27,710
And when that possession was removed, he said,
“I am a man again.” Is so simple, in one

148
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:35,560
day. He is a different man altogether today,
absolutely a different personality, and it

149
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,270
can happen to a woman.

150
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,650
We had somebody from Australia and she got
possessed by a man and she started talking

151
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,260
like that and behavior, the whole thing, her
husband got frightened, and he couldn’t

152
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,780
understand what’s gone wrong with this lady.
And the whole attitude, the whole beauty of

153
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,780
a woman was lost into the style of a man,
and it was so funny and odd to look at. Same

154
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:08,640
thing: she came to Sahaj Yoga and the spirit
ran away. She is a beautiful woman now, extremely

155
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,430
beautiful, and they’re having a very good
relationship.

156
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:18,430
So when you try to do anything perverted with
the sex and do not respect it, you do not

157
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,850
know what things are awaiting us around. So
before I go to other chakras, I want to tell

158
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:31,420
you about our other unknown areas which are
very important to us and then we’ll go to

159
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,960
the second chakra.

160
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,960
As you see here on the left hand side this
blue line is there. This blue line is our

161
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,920
power of desire by which we desire, by which
God has – supposing this is the primordial

162
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,610
being because God has made you in His own
image – supposing it is the image of God,

163
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:01,610
then it is His desire. This power of desire
gives you existence, and when this desire

164
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:08,700
is over, when the Spirit, which is watching
the drama of this body, gets fed up, it disappears,

165
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:18,110
then the death comes in. This power of desire
is the left side. We call it in Sanskrit as

166
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:27,050
Ida Nadi, also called as the Moon Nadi and
in the Hatha Yoga is the Tha Nadi. This is

167
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:33,940
the channel, is a subtle channel. But this
gives rise to the gross channel, which is

168
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,950
the left sympathetic nervous system. Now,
doctors don’t believe that left and right

169
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,380
sympathetic nervous systems are two different,
but you will find out yourself that they are

170
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:49,380
very different. This looks after our emotional
side, and also beyond this lies the area which

171
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,870
is unknown to us, is the subconscious; it
is unknown to us. Whatever is unknown is not

172
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:04,840
God, is not from God’s area. It is an unknown
area, and beyond that subconscious area, lies

173
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,840
the collective subconscious – all that has
died from our creation. Recently I was seeing

174
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:21,330
one of the series on cancer, in London on
the television, and they told that they have

175
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,240
discovered some sort of proteins, which they
call as protein 58 and 56 and all that, they

176
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,630
have given names, which they have also photographed
– enter into our being from areas which

177
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,630
are built within us, from unknown areas – they
do not know if they are known areas – which

178
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,350
are built within us since our creation. Now,
I’ve told this about ten years back in America

179
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,160
before. And they trigger the happening of
cancer, they trigger it.

180
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:05,160
So it is from the collective subconscious
this attack comes in. So if you move to the

181
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:13,870
left side, you move to the collective subconscious
too much and then all kinds of things can

182
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,870
happen to you. For example, first of all you
start getting shaking, you start hearing voices,

183
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:27,020
you start feeling that you are losing your
body; you are going on top of some place and

184
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,870
seeing things. Is all these spirits are doing.
Now it has reached such a serious state, that

185
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:40,870
in Switzerland I found that many children
were killed because of this action. The mother

186
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,740
is, supposing, with some clairvoyant lady
or somebody who is doing this spiritual work.

187
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,480
Is a very dangerous thing. One should never
take to this kind of a thing. If you take

188
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,400
to these things, then seven generations suffer.
Today only I had a girl who told Me that her

189
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,110
mother was a clairvoyant, and all her life
she was miserable with her husband and this

190
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:09,180
girl has been always crying and weeping and
she cannot conceive or something like that.

191
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,680
Is a very serious thing, one should never
go into these unknown areas of the collective

192
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,790
subconscious and worry about the dead and
control them and look after them and call

193
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:26,790
them. You must give them their freedom. Is
a very dangerous area into which you enter.

194
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,200
I hope you don’t mind it, I have to tell
you the truth, I am your Mother, and I have

195
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,870
to tell you the truth: that you should be
very careful about this kind of thing like

196
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:41,840
psychics or the people who try to say that
“You can get possessed.” They will not

197
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,730
say, they say, “It is, it is–” They
can even say, “This is Holy Ghost.” They

198
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,460
can say anything. But in whatever way, when
you find that you are not in control of the

199
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:58,810
situation, that means you are not there. Is
very simple as that, supposing your car is

200
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:05,440
driving and suddenly it goes into a khadd
[pit – ED.]. Now, do you think that you

201
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,440
have achieved a greater progress by that?
It’s just you have moved without your control.

202
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,799
If you have no control upon yourself …If
somebody sitting down and he starts jumping

203
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,799
– automatically, he cannot control his jumping
– then it is not himself, minimum of minimum.

204
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:30,990
Whatever he is, even that control is lost.
Anything, any such happening which is beyond

205
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,430
your control means that you are enslaved by
one of these possessions. But they are never

206
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,660
satisfied with what they do to you.

207
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,620
I mean like I’ll tell you one of the very
startling example of this left side. In London

208
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:52,350
we have – I don’t know now if they have
but we had – a center called, “Late Dr.

209
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:58,270
Laing’s International Curative Center.”
I didn’t know about it, but a lady came

210
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,530
to Me in India to tell Me about this.

211
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:08,170
She said she had some problem with her stomach
and she wrote to this organization saying

212
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,310
that “Please, help me to get cured.”

213
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:16,470
And they wrote back saying that “At five
o’clock on such-and-such date, we’ll enter

214
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,000
into your body.” I mean they were honest,
I must say, as English people are honest sometimes.

215
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,400
So he was honest to say that “We’ll enter
into your body, some of the doctors are there

216
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,760
who will enter into your body, and they’ll
cure you.” But afterwards, after five years

217
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,570
the lady was rattling, rattling just like
a junkie car. And she came to Me and then

218
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,950
she gave Me the history of this, which I verified.

219
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,270
The Dr. Laing, the Dr. Laing, the one, the
one who is the one who is supposed to be running,

220
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:54,270
is late, he’s dead. He entered into a soldier
in Vietnam, an American, and told him that

221
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,090
“You go and talk to my son and tell him
that I have entered into you and that you

222
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:06,840
should start such and such organization.”
Now this soldier has never done anything,

223
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,420
I mean he has never seen a scalpel also, he
doesn’t know how to operate, no question.

224
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:18,460
This soldier went to the son and told him,
and he told him certain secrets which convinced

225
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:25,460
the boy and they started that organization.
This organization went on like this. And this

226
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,300
soldier, of all the persons, used to do the
operation, you see it’s called “psychic

227
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:39,130
operation,” all sorts of things and he had
never seen anything and he used to be possessed

228
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:46,130
by this man and he did it. But why didn’t
he go to his son directly? Because he knew

229
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:53,470
about the dangers. And the same son will end
up – I am sure, hundred percent, the same

230
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:00,070
gentleman who is operating and the son – with
some trouble, which is of a very serious nature.

231
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,110
Because never play with the fire which is
the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

232
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,470
You have to be in the present and not in the
past.

233
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,490
Now the people who think too much about their
past, “What was my previous life?” Why

234
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:18,190
should you worry? Whatever it was is better
today because you can get realization today.

235
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:23,620
You could not get realization even if you
were the King of Egypt, what does it matter?

236
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,360
You couldn’t get your realization that day,
so why worry about the past? All the time

237
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,740
worrying about the past or playing with your
emotions, you see. Like we had one gentleman,

238
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:40,320
who used to always cry and weep too much and
his mother sent him to Me, and I asked him,

239
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,330
“What did you do all your life?”

240
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,870
He said, “I was very fond of Lord Byron
and I just read him.”

241
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:50,590
I said, “All right, that’s it.” This
Lord Byron, he led such a horrible life himself,

242
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,190
an unholy person, and made everybody cry,

243
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,530
“You suffer, you must suffer, you must weep.”
Why should you suffer?

244
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:02,530
The idea of a saint is that a person who is
absolutely in bones, walking like a TB patient,

245
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,250
is a saint. I mean is something sadistic,
I can’t see Christ. I was so happy to see

246
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:17,270
that you showed Him as a resurrection, that
is His message. Is resurrection is His message.

247
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:24,270
Crucifixion is just a means but resurrection
is the thing. And the lanky-panky stuff, walking

248
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:32,450
like a saint, how can that be? Is it possible,
a person who is bestowed with God’s blessing

249
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:38,860
has to be a healthy, cheerful and a very happy
person, has to be that. Minimum of minimum

250
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,370
should be that, and I was happy to see even
Mr. Paulsen here, who was very healthy and

251
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:51,200
this thing I said, “Now, this is a religious
place because wherever I go I find such serious

252
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,820
and absolutely sickly people.”

253
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:58,820
So the people who believe in sufferings, like…
the Jews they denied Christ. Why? Because

254
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:10,309
He was a Jew. Is absolutely true about human
nature. If I was an American, you would not

255
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:17,309
have accepted Me. In India the Indian Christians,
in whose community I was born, have not accepted

256
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:25,670
Me at all. Can you imagine? I have got Muslim
disciples, Hindus, I’ve got Parsis and Sikhs,

257
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:31,820
but hardly one or two and maybe My family
people. They have not accepted Me. They didn’t

258
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,480
accept Christ, and because they didn’t accept
they couldn’t accept that He suffered for

259
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,510
us. Why should we suffer? Has He suffered
less for you any way: has He left some for

260
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:48,140
you to suffer? So, you want to suffer, all
right have Hitler and suffer? That’s it!

261
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:55,140
Have him! If you enjoy suffering, why not?
And it started like that. Actually when Hitler

262
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,550
came, for eleven years, you will be amazed,
eleven years, these people were supposed to

263
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,770
be suffering you among themselves, you see?

264
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:10,040
In France if you go today people are sitting
outside and they are talking of their sufferings

265
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:16,410
and money and other nonsensical things. They
are waiting for the day, they said that that

266
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:22,240
in ‘82 in any case we are going to be finished,
waiting for– they discussing it very nicely.

267
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,290
Les Miserables I call them, as they are. So
why should you suffer, I just can’t understand,

268
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:35,290
when Christ has suffered for you? Only He’s
to be awakened within us. If He’s awakened,

269
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,480
He takes away all our sufferings, all our
conditionings, all our so-called karmas and

270
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,090
everything, which I will show you later on
how it works out.

271
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,880
So now we come to the left side then to the
right side. Right side is the action, the

272
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,880
power of action, is the Surya Nadi, is the
channel of the sun. When you want to enact

273
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:07,770
your desire, manifest it, then you use this
action power, Iccha Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

274
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,470
Now this power works mainly through this second
center, or we call it the third center, actually

275
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:20,750
it is the third because the second one is
that. This center is called as Swadisthana

276
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:27,750
and this center has got six, you can see six
plexuses, it’s like the Star of David.

277
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:36,820
Moses preached something, and Jews are doing
something else. Christ preached something,

278
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,570
and Christians are doing something else. Adi
Shankaracharya taught something, and Hindus

279
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,990
are doing just the opposite. Mohammed taught
something, and they did just the opposite.

280
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:55,630
It’s not only in religion, in every way
you see how we are perverted. Like this center

281
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:02,630
is used for converting the fat in your stomach
for the use of your brain. Nor do we realize

282
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:12,920
that our brain is made of fat. Do we know
all our nerves are made of fat. Now there’s

283
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:19,760
a general principle in this country that you
should not use any butter, which is very wrong.

284
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,640
When you don’t use any butter how are you
going to supply this brain with something,

285
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,200
I mean where will you get, it’s completely
drained out.

286
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,200
You use your brain so much, so much so, that
this poor center has to work only for your

287
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:42,270
thinking which has no productivity. You just
go on thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking;

288
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,850
two horns come out of your head of thinking;
still you are thinking, and they go on growing,

289
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:52,300
you cannot stop your thinking. And what are
you thinking, what have you got out of your

290
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,070
thinking?

291
00:32:53,070 --> 00:33:00,070
This right side is the one which is our five
elements also, five elements within us. So

292
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:09,750
when we started discovering what is the essence
of the five elements, in India we started

293
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,010
the Vedas thousands of years back, and the
effect of that is shown now, is the science,

294
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:23,380
you discovered, the science. That you understood
how to master these five elements. But what

295
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:28,580
did you do with it? You created bombs; horrible
bombs you have created. You have created these

296
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:35,000
devils and now you are frightened of them.
Thank God. That’s something good that all

297
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,429
such ventures stop by themselves because you
create a bomb, it becomes a devil on top of

298
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:45,900
your head. Now you can’t start war because
as soon as you start means no more existence.

299
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,090
So you are frightened and that is how – where
have we gone to?

300
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:56,429
Science has led us to which sensible things,
we should think. For example science has given

301
00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:03,320
us all these devices by which our life can
be made very easy. We can have more time,

302
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:10,230
we can have much more time than our forefathers
had, who had to do everything with their own

303
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,809
hands and go about it, but here, you see,
everything is instant. I mean anything: You

304
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:19,780
want to have food? All right you have instant,
everything is made instant. But for what is

305
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:25,770
it instant, is to save time. Now we have watches
also here to save time, everybody’s saving

306
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,270
time, saving time, everybody “busy” saving
time. But what are you doing about the saved

307
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:36,399
time? What do we do with it? For example there
was a gentleman coming from India, very busy

308
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,059
man, “Very busy, there’s no time to talk
to anyone.”

309
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:46,159
And I said, “Wanna, why are you in such
a great hurry to go?”

310
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,819
“Oh, you don’t know! I have very important
–“

311
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:49,069
“What?”

312
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:51,639
“I have to attend a particular ball for
five hours there.”

313
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,359
“Very good. Is that the way you are going
to save?”

314
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:59,950
“And then I have to attend a racecourse,
I have to do this, I have to do that.” This

315
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,760
is no saving of time; this is the real waste
of time. Real waste of time is this way we

316
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,760
do it, and how are we going to save our time?
Time is to be saved to be realized, to be

317
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:18,759
in meditation, to enjoy the beauties of God.
That’s why these all things are given to

318
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:23,450
us, and that’s how we should look at them.
But now we have become their slaves.

319
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:30,450
When we achieve something, for example electricity,
it is so important to New York that one day

320
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:36,460
it stopped, the whole thing stopped. So we
become also slaves to these. Apart from that,

321
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:42,759
now we have no time, we are so busy. I don’t
know. I thought that here people will have

322
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:46,989
more time than we have in India because, you
see, if you have to travel we have very funny

323
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:52,279
trains, and we have not yet developed as you
people are. Sometimes I have to go to villages

324
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:57,579
in bullock carts and this and this. But people
have no time. This is the trouble in these

325
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:03,059
countries, you have no time at all and I don’t
know what constructive work they are doing

326
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:03,720
for themselves.

327
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,109
So this is what is the right side where we
go wrong. But the worst thing we do is to

328
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:17,109
think. We think all the time, and what do
we think? Either we think of aggression or

329
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:26,670
we think of recession. For example we think
that, “Oh, we are guilty.” You do something

330
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:31,450
and then you sit down, “Oh, I should not
have done it, this is very wrong I should

331
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:38,019
not have done it,” and you start wondering
about it, correcting about it. But actual

332
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:44,079
correction is not there, actual correction
is not there, only by thinking you avoid the

333
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,749
main issue. You have to be in the present
but thinking can only take you to the left

334
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:55,119
or to the right, to the past or to the present.
[future – ED?] You cannot be at the state

335
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,749
where you become just yourself, there’s
no thought. There is no mental activity at

336
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:07,450
all, you just become. Because a thought rises
like this and falls off, another thought rises

337
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,579
like that and falls off, in between them is
a very little space which is the present.

338
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:18,440
So the past comes to the future and becomes,
again the future comes in and again becomes

339
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,999
the past like that. But in between is the
present and that present is very small.

340
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:30,980
Unless and until you know how to stay in that
present, you will be always tossing on these

341
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,980
waves of past and future while past is finished
and future doesn’t exist. You plan out something,

342
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:44,309
it – all plans goes out. You plan anything
but how can you plan also, I can’t understand.

343
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:49,579
Supposing you don’t know the way, and you
plan that, “I will go right and left.”

344
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,069
Now supposing you are going to the right and
left is the sea, will you jump in the sea?

345
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:59,069
Anything that you have to do new, you cannot
plan it out, you have to keep it just open,

346
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:07,619
like a seed when it sprouts, it has got a
living cell at its tip. It goes and sees for

347
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:14,049
itself how it has to move. When there is hardness,
it moves round the hardness, when there is

348
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:15,339
softness, it moves like that.

349
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:21,559
So when we plan everything we really become
rigid, and like – I heard of a person who

350
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:26,420
planned everything for his picnic. He had
all champagne and everything put together

351
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,910
and when he reached the place he had no bottle
opener and he had to break the bottles. That’s

352
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:37,339
what it is. Sometimes the planning can be
such a headache, I mean, you waste one hour

353
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:42,579
in planning and while it comes to reality
you find it’s all wrong, it doesn’t work

354
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:48,109
out. So too much planning, like I have to
go supposing to Los Angeles, I have to book

355
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:51,989
My ticket, this is today, I have to do it
today. I don’t have to sit down and plan

356
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:54,450
that on such and such date I’ll go and book
it.

357
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,549
So in the present if you know how to live,
but this cannot be done by saying that “You

358
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:02,970
live in present.” It cannot be done, I know
because that’s not some sort of a thing

359
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:08,069
that can be taught. It has to happen to you,
you have to become that. Once you become that,

360
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:15,069
then you become thoughtlessly aware. You become
a witness. You see the whole show as a drama,

361
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,589
and you don’t get involved into it. You
just see the waves coming up and going down.

362
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:26,900
Like, I can say, you are standing in the water,
and there are waves around and you are frightened,

363
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:33,739
but if you are put in the boat you start seeing
those things. If you know how to swim you

364
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:33,989
can enjoy those waves.

365
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:39,880
In the same way when you become a master,
when you come in the boat in the state of

366
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,390
thoughtless awareness then you start seeing
these things and the whole thing appears like

367
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,779
a drama. Actually the whole thing is a drama
but the drama must end for you to see that

368
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:54,559
it’s just a drama and you are unnecessarily
worried about it, and by worry, you know for

369
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,589
definite nothing works out. But if I say,
“Don’t worry,” you’ll worry more,

370
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:04,079
that’s not the way. That’s not the way.
They all tried these tricks to say, “Don’t

371
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,369
do that and don’t do that,” it never worked.
With human beings it doesn’t work out. It’s

372
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:11,670
all right with animals, you can work it out,
but with human beings, if you tell them, “Don’t,”

373
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:18,140
they’ll do it ten time. So best is to so
make them that. Unless and until they are

374
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,710
made the spirit it’s impossible to convince
a modern man to do something. So is best is

375
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,940
first let them have their realization, let
them have their light, let them see for themselves

376
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,450
what’s the problem, let them feel it and
correct it. It’s let them judge themselves,

377
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:40,210
that is the best way is to do it, and that’s
the time has come for you to have it and see

378
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:47,210
for yourself and be able to discriminate between
false and reality.

379
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:54,269
Now this side beyond is the supraconscious
area, and beyond this is the collective supraconscious.

380
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:03,489
Now if you take LSD, for example you take
LSD, you go onto supraconscious area. I was

381
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,400
surprised when I went to Colombia, I asked
them, they had a condor as their emblem for

382
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:19,559
navy, and I said, “How condor is your emblem?”
because condor has nothing to do with the

383
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:19,989
navy.

384
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:26,989
They said, “Our old Indians have told us
that a God called Shri Vishnu,” just see

385
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:33,160
the name, “came on a condor.” And really
condor is the conveyance of Vishnu. Can you

386
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,910
imagine? I was amazed at this. How did these
people in thousands of years backs saw, but

387
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:43,220
then I said, “What were they doing normally,
what was their pastime?” And they showed

388
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:50,220
Me a thing made out of a shell of a fruit
and with a little stirring rod in it.

389
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:54,799
I said, “What is this?”

390
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,559
They said, “They used to make some sort
of a amrose.”

391
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,329
“Oh, I see, that’s it.”

392
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:03,869
And even today Peru is exporting that amrose
to you which is nothing but LSD.

393
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:09,759
If you take things like that, of that nature,
of LSD nature, you go to the right side. You

394
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:14,400
move to your supraconscious area. Means you
get disintegrated.

395
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,099
In the morning I told you that when you are
integrated you don’t see any auras or anything

396
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:23,299
around the person. When you are disintegrated,
only then you see because you become these

397
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:29,170
five elements. When you are integrated you
don’t see anything. And then you start seeing

398
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:34,229
these things, like an eye and a light, and
all those things you start seeing, and if

399
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:41,229
you go further, further with it into supraconscious
areas, you can become horribly possessed by

400
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:49,519
the people who have been ambitious. Even Hitler
can possess you. Hitler did that. Hitler did

401
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:56,200
all supraconscious activity in Germany. How
he possessed people was through supraconscious.

402
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Because in the supraconscious, collective
supraconscious, there are many ambitious people

403
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,400
who have died. Like Gauguin was an ambitious
man, but he became mad, I don’t know how

404
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,729
he became mad. Normally an ambitious man doesn’t
become mad he makes everyone mad, but he doesn’t

405
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:17,509
become himself. But this fellow was possessed,
and we saw it in the television that a man

406
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:22,410
who was possessed by this Gauguin was painting
just like him. I know – you see Gauguin’s

407
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:27,150
paintings, that you must be knowing also that
in one line he puts lots of color and he was

408
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,779
doing it very fast. And he said, “I’m
possessed by Gauguin.”

409
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:35,630
So these ambitious people, like some of the
ambitious people could be doctors, could be

410
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:42,630
mathematicians, can be physicians or anything
like that, they can possess.

411
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:50,729
I know of a lady, she is a unique mathematician
and she’s possessed, definitely possessed.

412
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,739
And she can tell you anything you ask her,
any square root, anything she can tell you,

413
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:58,170
and she’s earning lot of money out of it
but she’s always sick, she has a headache.

414
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,410
She came to Me for curing, I said, “You
have to give up this nonsense.”

415
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,979
She said, “Let me make sufficient money,
then I’ll give up.”

416
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:10,089
I said, “By that time I may not be there.”

417
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:14,190
So these things can happen to you with the
supraconscious activity and this awareness

418
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,880
of supraconscious is also very dangerous.
The trouble is if you suffer from the superego

419
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:26,739
there, from this side, with the conditionings,
you suffer. I mean you get the pains all over

420
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:32,819
the body, you might feel sick, you will cry
and weep, you’ll be unhappy, it troubles

421
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:38,470
you. But when you are possessed by this ego
business, as it is ego is too much, and then

422
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:44,700
if you get possessed by somebody egoistical,
then God save that person and God save all

423
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,609
the relations, because such a person you cannot
even talk, he’s so aggressive, he’s so

424
00:44:49,609 --> 00:44:56,609
aggressive, he will aggress all the other
people ultimately he himself becomes absolutely

425
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,239
stupid fool.

426
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,559
Many people whom we think are very successful
in life, really are stupid; if you look at

427
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,410
them they are really stupid people. Like we
can say, this Kennedy’s… a man, what was

428
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,150
his name is, whom she married –

429
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,059
Man: Onasis

430
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:21,059
Shri Mataji: He was a stupid fool, I have
met him. I met him; he was a real fool I tell

431
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,380
you. I don’t know how this woman married
him and she must be another stupid fool to

432
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,319
marry him. Both must be foolish. Actually
I met him very well, because My husband is

433
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,519
with the shipping, and I don’t know how
could she marry this old man like her grandfather

434
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:38,989
and what was the thing? Maybe money part or
whatever it was, I mean it’s so stupid,

435
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:45,369
the whole thing is so stupid. And this stupidity
you can see, even it grows with your age more

436
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,880
and more, and you become more stupid.

437
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,079
Like an eighty-year-old woman writing love
letters to an eighteen-year-old boy. It’s

438
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,009
stupidity. Is absolute stupidity, I tell you,
if you see it from wisdom point of view. One

439
00:45:58,009 --> 00:46:02,650
can’t understand an old man, who is like
a great-grandfather, writing a love letter

440
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,930
to a little girl of eighteen years or an old
woman, who could be a great-great-great-grandmother

441
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:11,210
writing to a little boy like that, it’s
absurd. And they are so stupid and they talk

442
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:17,729
like this, “I believe in this.” Of course
all the donkeys believe like that, so there’s

443
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:19,200
nothing new about it.

444
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,190
But they are so starringly stupid that you
are amazed, you know. You start looking at

445
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:31,910
them, “What’s the matter with them?”
This is the blessing of this mister ego, which

446
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:37,930
exists in the head sometimes goes up like
a balloon, but you start seeing it, you start

447
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,799
seeing it when you get your realization.

448
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:48,799
I had a disciple, one of My sons, who came
to Me and one day he said, “Mother, I’m

449
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:51,970
really frightened with one idea.”

450
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,259
I Said, “What is it?”

451
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:55,559
“But You don’t tell me if it is true.”

452
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,829
I said, “What is it?”

453
00:46:56,829 --> 00:46:59,130
He said, “Was I Napoleon in my last life?”

454
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,170
I said, “What makes you think like that?”

455
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,609
“Because I can see such a big ego on my
head, this could be only Napoleon and I know

456
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:10,279
how to draw. These two things put together,
could I have been Napoleon, but if I was You

457
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:14,630
don’t tell me otherwise I may commit suicide”
– even after realization.

458
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:21,630
So it is ego becomes then a headache to us.
It becomes a headache and we want to get rid

459
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:27,559
of it. We start seeing it, and it presses
you, you get a headache and you feel it in

460
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:34,009
the Agnya, how it troubles you. Then it starts
troubling you – not others so much as it

461
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:36,999
troubles you – because you don’t want
to accept that you are egoistical, you start

462
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:41,319
seeing it. But you don’t say that you have
a ego, you will come and tell Me, “Mother

463
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:45,119
I’ve got an Agnya catching,” and we have
to clear that Agnya. Nobody feels bad about

464
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,809
it because you are separated from yourself.
You don’t feel that you are hurt or insulted

465
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:55,380
because you get separated, and you see for
yourself. Like this sari has some sort of

466
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,910
a black spot on it, so I see it, I take it
out, and then I want to wash it, I don’t

467
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,239
want to keep it black; I am not identified
with it.

468
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,640
So all these fixations also drop out when
you get realized, because you go in the center,

469
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,410
not on the left or to the right.

470
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:16,410
Now movement on the right, actually is the
blessing of this center, in the center, because

471
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:26,940
the central line is this line of our evolution,
is the line of sustenance, is the line by

472
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:29,690
which we have become human beings.

473
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:36,690
First of all we get our sustenance, like we
can say the gold is untarnishable. That is

474
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:44,279
the sustenance of gold. We can say carbon
has four valences, in the same way human beings

475
00:48:44,279 --> 00:48:50,910
have ten valences – they are in the stomach.
These are the ten sustenance described as

476
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:57,910
the Ten Commandments in the Bible. They all
can be explained very well in Sahaj Yoga.

477
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:05,029
This is the human sustenance which is around
in that part which we call as Void. It’s

478
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:13,099
not the same Void, or is the gap, as the Zen,
but this is the Void, we mean the space where

479
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:21,619
we exist in our evolutionary state. Now this
center is the one that is presided over – this

480
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:30,920
one, the second one is presided over by the
Creator, and this one is through the Preserver,

481
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,609
the one who preserves.

482
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:37,859
Now there can be a problem with people who
believe that there is one God. I also believe

483
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:42,779
the same thing. I mean, it is true: He – there’s
only one God, but He has different aspects.

484
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:49,430
God doesn’t exist like, say, Rock of Gibraltar.
Even Rock of Gibraltar, if you see, it has

485
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:56,430
got aspects. God has aspects like a gentleman,
now say for example if a gentleman is a minister

486
00:49:56,499 --> 00:50:01,950
here, he could be a husband, he could be a
father, he could be a brother, he could be

487
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:07,499
anything. So God has different aspects and
out of that the first aspect, as I told you

488
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:13,809
of the existence, the power of existence,
that does not incarnate on this earth, it

489
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:19,450
does not incarnate, it just exist, it watches,
it sees, and that is in the heart, which is

490
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:26,450
the Spirit – expression of that God Almighty
who is watching the spectacle of His Power.

491
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:35,200
Now the other aspect of God is that He’s
a Creator, He creates all these galaxies and

492
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,200
all these things now as I told you yesterday
about the Vishuddhi Chakra, we are this center

493
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:50,660
which is America, that if this center is awakened
here, you don’t have to have any missiles

494
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:58,809
or anything. As in the Saturn, you have got
a girdle around, you too have that girdle

495
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:04,739
around America and nobody can touch you, but
you are to be awakened first of all. If you

496
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:11,739
are awakened in that center, nobody can touch
you. Russia is going to know about it, they

497
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:18,279
have to know about it because they are getting
into parapsychology and all these things and

498
00:51:18,279 --> 00:51:22,809
they are going to get possessed about this.
They have to know through their supraconscious

499
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:25,279
that you are the people who are awakened.

500
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:30,609
Once you are awakened nobody can touch you,
because there’s a girdle round you, and

501
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:36,279
there are sixteen sub-plexuses as there are
sixteen, you have seen there are sixteen substar

502
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:38,009
– sub, what do you call them?

503
00:51:38,009 --> 00:51:38,690
Warren: Moons

504
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:45,690
Shri Mataji: Moons, they call them moons,
sixteen moons around Saturn. And you are one

505
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:52,839
guided by Saturn. Saturn makes this country.
Saturn has made this country, and this is

506
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:57,529
the Vishuddhi Chakra which is a very important
chakra about which I’ll tell later.

507
00:51:57,529 --> 00:52:04,529
So this center we come to of our evolution.
Is presided by the Preserver, the aspect of

508
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:12,019
preservation, He’s the Father who looks
after us; He’s the One who gives us our

509
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:17,880
wellbeing. He comes on this earth again and
again in different forms. According to Indian

510
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Puranas, the Ark of Noah was saved by a fish,
which was a dolphin, and this dolphin fish

511
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:34,390
was this aspect which incarnated. Then the
second aspect came as the tortoise, then the

512
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:42,839
third as a quadiped. Like that they have described
the evolution, how these incarnations had

513
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:49,839
to come to break the barriers of the evolutionary
ignorance. These are the people who came for

514
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:59,059
the break-through. Ultimately a short man
was created called as Vamana, then a very

515
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,440
fiery, big man, he’s called as Passidon,
[Poseidon – ED] in Greek language.

516
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,979
Greeks made their gods look like human beings;
I mean they never kept their purity. See,

517
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:15,609
everybody was given with some quality of a
human being. I don’t know why they did it

518
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:22,039
but that’s how they spoiled the whole game.
Now this god, the god, which we can say or

519
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:29,039
the incarnation that came on this earth was
a fiery man, a man who fought the nature,

520
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:38,089
who fought all the different elements. And
then after that came another aspect on this

521
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:47,890
earth, who was Shri Rama, is the ideal king,
the king who is a benevolent king, the One

522
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:57,150
who gave us the political idea about how to
govern – Shri Rama – this was eight thousand

523
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,960
years back.

524
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:04,960
Then came the incarnation, after that the
incarnation came in the center here, before,

525
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:11,579
before Rama, this incarnation was of the Goddess,
of the primordial Mother. She Herself incarnated

526
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:18,579
on this earth before Rama, because many forces
which were negative were collected by the

527
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:25,019
ignorance of human beings, and the seekers
were very much harmed. So She came on this

528
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:32,019
earth to kill those horrible, demonic forces
and to destroy them and to save the seekers,

529
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:39,589
Her children, to save them from this drowning
into the sea of illusion, and She came on

530
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:45,160
this earth. As they say she came thousand
times, but actually She came many-a-times

531
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,119
before Shri Rama came in.

532
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:53,359
Then came Shri Rama who came on the right-hand
side of the heart. Now this is also a very

533
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:59,170
important center within us. Those people who
have problems with the fatherhood. Like today

534
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:04,950
there was a girl who was catching on the right
hand, this heart, this is the center. We asked

535
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:11,089
her what about her father, and she told Me,
“My father is dead but he’s still guiding

536
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:11,729
me.”

537
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:16,499
I said, “That’s not good, you must give
relief to your father. He should be given

538
00:55:16,499 --> 00:55:18,749
freedom, and you will feel better.”

539
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:25,210
And people with this heart get asthma. This
side, this problem, on this finger we feel,

540
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:29,999
get asthma, problems with their breathing…
All these things can be cured if you just

541
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:36,759
tell them that, “You ask your father to
leave you and to be born again and forget

542
00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:43,759
about it.” It works wonders, we have seen.
But recently a doctor in England has performed

543
00:55:44,289 --> 00:55:51,289
some experiments with, what you call, anorexia
– there’s a disease anorexia, where the

544
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:58,109
girls just don’t eat any food. He found
out that these girls, when they were told

545
00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:03,650
about their father, and that a rite can be,
I mean the after death rites can be done and

546
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:07,489
all that, they felt all right and they got
rid of it.

547
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:11,900
Can you imagine this is experimented and found
out now; I mean this we have been doing for

548
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,339
the last ten years, but recently it has been
found out that if a girl is suffering from

549
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:22,479
this disease of anorexia, you can cure it;
if the father is dead, then only it happens.

550
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:29,479
So fatherhood –a man who is not a good father,
a man who has a bad father, a girl who is

551
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:37,359
too much attached to the father or a girl
who is not treated nicely also by her husband

552
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:42,650
– also the husband is there – if he doesn’t
look after her well, she can suffer.

553
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:47,119
Now the center part, this one – the one
he’s there [Warren is showing on the Virata

554
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,680
Chakra chart] – center heart, it’s also
a very, very important center where the Goddess

555
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:58,680
– the world, we say the Mother of the World,
Jagadamba She’s called – has incarnated.

556
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Is a very important thing for us, because
when you suffer, say, from any insecurities,

557
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:14,089
then this center starts going into palpitations,
this center starts vibrating very much. Till

558
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,650
the boy is of twelve years or a girl is of
twelve years, in the sternum bone the antibodies

559
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:28,650
are created by this center. This center creates
the antibodies and they circulate in the whole

560
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:34,839
body and remain there, and whenever there
is an attack, either from a entity or from

561
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:39,999
any disease or anything, these antibodies
fight it. And that is the center which is

562
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:45,459
very important, specially for women. If their
motherhood is challenged or if they are insecure,

563
00:57:45,459 --> 00:57:51,180
if their husbands are making them insecure
by any of their behavior, then they develop

564
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:58,180
this trouble of this center, where they may
get breast cancer. Breast cancer comes to

565
00:57:58,589 --> 00:58:05,589
women when they are insecure. Only it can
be cured when this center is awakened; breast

566
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:12,660
cancer can be very easily cured, if they could
be secured through awakening of this center

567
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,670
of the Mother of the Universe.

568
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:21,640
And then we have the center up there, which
is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which is a very important…

569
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:28,640
for you, because it is adorned by the completion
of this evolution as called as Virat – it

570
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:41,269
is Shri Krishna, who is the complete incarnation
of this primordial being. And He is placed

571
00:58:43,279 --> 00:58:50,279
there. It is He who is the witness, who is
watching. When the Kundalini rises over this,

572
00:58:56,019 --> 00:58:58,400
you start witnessing the whole thing.

573
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,749
It has got sixteen sub plexuses and which
look after your face, your nose, eyes, ears

574
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:11,749
and all these places. And when this center
is out, then you have all kinds of problems.

575
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:20,130
Say the left side, left side Vishuddhi Chakra
catches when you feel guilty, when you are

576
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:24,549
diffident. When you start thinking that, “It
is very wrong too, I should have not done

577
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:29,559
this,” and all that, then the left Vishuddhi
catches. Or also with smoking it catches;

578
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:36,559
smoking spoils this center very much. Imagine
in America the percentage of smokers is the

579
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:43,369
maximum. Can you imagine, in this center only
where they are born, this is the maximum here?

580
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:50,369
Like England is the heart of the universe,
where they are lethargic. Europe is the liver

581
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:57,549
of the world where they are drinking. America
is the Vishuddhi of the world where they are

582
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,739
smoking. What a justice done to themselves
and to God, their Creator! So smoking is against

583
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:08,660
this center. Thank God now it is established
that it causes cancer, but still people are

584
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:12,499
smoking, they say, “What does it matter?”

585
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:17,059
But this is a very, very important center
for us because this is the time when we raised

586
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:21,559
our head, this center came up. Now see the
ego and superego start developing actually

587
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:28,559
from here. So this gives rise to ego and superego.
Somebody is a very arrogant person, catches

588
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:35,469
on the right; who is a very aggressive type
he catches on the right Vishuddhi. In the

589
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:42,469
center, a person who is against God, who is
anti-God, who is against collectivity, who

590
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:54,880
is talking against God, who is openly saying
things against God, catches on this center.

591
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:02,529
So this center, as it is, is very important
for you, because if you can awaken this center

592
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:07,349
within you here, as I’ve told you, you become
as powerful as Shri Krishna.

593
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:14,349
Shri Krishna has a Samhara Shakti. He has
the power to kill; He has four special things

594
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:21,680
with Him, four weapons by which He kills,
but one of them is this, in His hand, is a

595
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:28,680
discus and this discus is shown around the
Saturn which you see. And with this discus

596
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:36,359
at any distance He can destroy. So His destructive
powers are built in you. Nobody can destroy

597
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:45,739
you. You have to just get to your Self and
become your Self. You’ll become so powerful

598
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:52,739
a nation – but powerful in loving, in being
compassionate and affectionate, in the real

599
01:01:54,029 --> 01:01:59,959
sense of the word, not the way we are now
trying to help others; is not the way. It

600
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:04,660
can be very disgraceful sometimes; the way
we try to help others can be very disgraceful.

601
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:10,279
You will be amazed how, sometimes you people
have helped and have created problem for others.

602
01:02:10,279 --> 01:02:17,279
I’ll give a very simple example which is
really surprising and astonishing. Some years

603
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:23,150
back we had a dearth of wheat, and people
sent horrible wheat to India, horrible, that

604
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:29,029
even the animals would not eat. Just to help
us, you see. We are not so badly off people;

605
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:34,719
we are very fussy about food. We may be poor
but we don’t eat everything; we are very

606
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:41,719
fussy. So people threw away that wheat outside.
That wheat grew into a grass, which was called

607
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:48,900
as “Congress Grass,” can you imagine,
and that grass started moving from the roads

608
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:56,019
to the fields, from the fields to all the
trees and started engulfing them. It was like

609
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:03,119
a mad grass, it was like a malignant grass,
eating away everything that there was. Imagine,

610
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:09,890
as it is we had dearth of thing and this thing
came, and we didn’t know what to do with

611
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:10,469
it.

612
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:15,849
So we tried some Sahaj Yoga tricks and it
has worked, and thank God that grass is now

613
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:22,469
finished. But from that grass you had sent
some other seeds of acacia, and these also

614
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:28,329
people threw away. Out of this came out such
horrible trees of acacia that it has got thorns

615
01:03:28,329 --> 01:03:32,670
which are poisonous. And in the villages they
have grown so big that children can’t play

616
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:38,650
and if they touch that they get very seriously
ill. It’s a very seri– which you have

617
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:45,479
done so innocently. There’s no grace about
it, I think, the way it was done, and that’s

618
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:49,779
how we can create problem through our help
to others because what is there to help. Who

619
01:03:49,779 --> 01:03:53,779
is the other?

620
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:58,539
If you are the collectivity, if you are Shri
Krishna, then what are you helping? You are

621
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:02,969
helping yourself, this is your own finger.
If you help your own finger, you don’t help

622
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:09,569
it in a different way than you help other
fingers. That means you become collective

623
01:04:09,569 --> 01:04:16,569
being, and you are. People like Abraham Lincoln,
as I said yesterday, and great people in this

624
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:23,910
country established these great ideals of
liberty. And the liberty, they said that,

625
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:32,059
even Roosevelt once said that “Poverty anywhere
is a threat to prosperity anywhere.” What

626
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:39,819
at great thing to say, to feel that, that
oneness with others, that anywhere poverty

627
01:04:39,819 --> 01:04:43,319
is a threat to our prosperity!

628
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:48,670
All this collectivity has been expressed by
your great men in this country, not only but

629
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:55,670
the sense of responsibility because it is
on your shoulders, the responsibility. Responsibility

630
01:04:58,069 --> 01:05:05,069
of making others the Self, realize, is your
responsibility. You are the responsible nation,

631
01:05:07,459 --> 01:05:12,579
you are responsible for the whole universe,
whatever things you do here that goes outside.

632
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:17,119
You took to rock ’n roll, people started
doing rock ’n roll, you did anything nonsensical

633
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,890
that started going abroad. Anything nonsensical
you do here spreads everywhere because Americans

634
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:25,660
are doing. Jeans, now everybody wears, even
in India! Imagine in that hot country they

635
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:32,660
are wearing very strong, starched ones, and
they get all kinds of problems with that,

636
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:37,869
circulation problems [INDISTINCT: I mean?],
but… “Americans are doing,” everybody

637
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:39,789
is becoming American in India.

638
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:44,670
That’s it, in every developing country you
have put your hand; you have interest in everyone,

639
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:51,670
but should be done after realization when
you feel the pangs of others, you feel the

640
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:59,549
heart, you feel the real pain of others within
yourself, and you do it, not because you want

641
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:03,410
to do it for others, but do it because you
want to save yourself out of that pain. You

642
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:10,190
do it for yourself. If somebody’s drowned
and you try to save a person who is drowned,

643
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:13,910
then you don’t save him you actually are
saving yourself because something in you is

644
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:18,930
getting drowned there. And that happens to
you when you become that collective being,

645
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:25,190
when you become the Spirit, then it happens
to you. Before that, whatever you do is disgraceful,

646
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:31,459
sometimes can be harmful, can be very ugly
and sometimes it can be so grotesque that

647
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:33,989
people say, “All right, you keep your help
to yourself, we don’t want to have any more

648
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:40,989
of this.” I mean you take away all the self-respect
of people.

649
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:48,099
So one has to understand that you stand here
in this world, in this universe as a collective

650
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:54,400
being, as the representative of that collective
being at this Vishuddhi Chakra and you have

651
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:01,400
to give with your hands. For giving. This
applies to your hands and you must give, those

652
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:07,390
hands which have never given are no good,
they are very insensitive hands, you must

653
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:12,660
give, and that must come into you, and not
giving for giving’s sake, but Nirvach,,

654
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:19,660
as they say, without any, any return about
it. Nothing, is just giving, just flowing,

655
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:25,739
just like the Sun’s rays are coming to you,
they don’t want anything in return, do they?

656
01:07:25,739 --> 01:07:32,739
Just flowing. When that should happen, if
Sahaj Yoga takes to it, I hope it takes to

657
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,469
America that Americans accept Sahaj Yog, that
it works out. You have already got all kinds

658
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:46,069
of horrible people here. I don’t know how
you are going to work it out, but God willing,

659
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:50,219
with your determination, I am sure.

660
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:56,640
This is the first Unity Church I’m visiting
and I hope that in other Unity Churches also,

661
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,839
it will be made convenient for Me and we can
save other people also, and they can become

662
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:09,839
realized souls and they can become the Vishuddhi
Chakras, the responsible people, men of God,

663
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:19,259
those who have to become prophets, that they
are responsible that they have to make others

664
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:26,259
also prophets and save so many seekers who
are gathered in this great country of yours

665
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:35,410
because they know here it will happen, and
that they should be enabled to enter into

666
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:38,850
the Kingdom of God because the time has come
for that.

667
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:45,819
So we come up to Vishuddhi Chakra, and the
last center, chakra, here is the center of

668
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:46,680
Christ.

669
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:53,680
[ASIDE: Should I go? If I do it tomorrow,
would be better. All right?]

670
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:03,430
Tomorrow about Christ I’ll tell you because
I want to take one hour explaining Him very

671
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:10,410
well. I was very much impressed by your whole
idea about Christ, the unity, the integration

672
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:17,410
and your symbols are very correct, everything
is just there, somebody has to just trigger

673
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:25,670
it, and it will work out. First you must get
your realization, grow into it, develop your

674
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:34,640
discrimination, you become your own guru,
and then everything that you are doing in

675
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,190
this Unity Church will have a great meaning,
you can prove it, you can prove it that there

676
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:45,990
is God, there is Christ, there are all these
incarnations. Christ Himself has said that

677
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:52,250
“Those who are not against Me are with Me.”
These are the people.

678
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:59,200
And I’m sure one day it will happen that
Unity Church will show its own worth, its

679
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:06,200
own explanation of its existence, why it came
into existence.

680
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:13,990
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

681
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:24,460
If you have any questions you may ask, and
then we’ll have the session for realization.

682
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:35,920
Seeker: Sometimes in meditation and in chanting,
a person will be rocking. Would you consider

683
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:52,470
that a negative thing?

684
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:58,440
Warren: Sometimes in meditation people will
rock or move. Is this a negative thing?

685
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:04,210
Shri Mataji: Absolutely, absolutely. You should
not rock, there should be no movement, the

686
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:09,110
eyes should be steady, there should be no
movement in the eyelids, nothing. This rocking

687
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:16,110
is absolutely wrong. All these things should
not happen to you, that’s not meditation.

688
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:23,210
Meditation is where you are absolutely normal,
you are always in meditation after realization,

689
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:25,350
you are in meditation.

690
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:31,980
Question: I’ve studied with Paramahansa
Yogananda the SRF, Self-Realization Fellowship,

691
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:38,980
and one of the things they teach is to focus
the eyes, with the eyes closed only on the

692
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,190
[INAUDIBLE].

693
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:47,610
Shri Mataji: I must say that I don’t want
to start any controversy. That’s one thing

694
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:54,610
sure, but I’ll tell you that proof of the
pudding is in the eating. Let’s go this

695
01:11:55,870 --> 01:12:00,990
way. First of all logically we should see,
we have to get baptism through here, not through

696
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:06,490
here. Do we get baptism through here? If the
door is here what’s the use of breaking

697
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:13,490
this window? And focusing and effort is not
going to give you realization, is wrong. You

698
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,890
see this pampers– human effort, you see
it pampers you that you can put in an effort.

699
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:28,170
You cannot. One must accept this position:
we cannot put in an effort for a living thing.

700
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:33,830
For example, as I told you, for a seed if
you have to sprout it you have to put it in

701
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:38,390
the Mother Earth. You cannot pull it out,
isn’t it? Whatever you may try, you cannot

702
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:45,390
pull it out and sprout. You cannot put in
any effort. Any effort is wrong, is against

703
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,870
spontaneity and living things. So no effort
is needed as such.

704
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:58,870
Lady: I’d like to ask Her about that center
where the immune bodies develop, at what age

705
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:08,120
and what can we do in order to make that immunity
get bigger or…

706
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:21,800
Warren: She says two questions. At what age
does the immune bodies start developing and

707
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,780
secondly is there any way in which you can
expand the capacity of the immune bodies?

708
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:33,200
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. Of course,
that is what Sahaj Yoga is. When you become

709
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,750
the truth, all untruth falls off, is that
is what Sahaj Yoga is; absolutely that is

710
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:42,230
what it is. Tomorrow, I am going to tell you
about Christ and about cancer; about all these

711
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:46,070
immune bodies how we fight them. That may
be day after tomorrow, I don’t know, but

712
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:50,280
tomorrow, may not be, but day after tomorrow
I’ll tell you how to grow into it. Absolutely.

713
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:57,280
You learn how to protect, you learn how to
fight. Absolutely. That is what happens after

714
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:05,830
realization then you must learn the divine
technique, not before realization. After realization,

715
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:12,830
not before. Before it is connected what’s
the use of playing with it? It has to be connected

716
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,040
first.

717
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,160
What is it?

718
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:21,320
Warren: Any other questions?

719
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:28,320
Man: What are the avenues available to keep
these channels open?

720
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:35,890
Warren: What are the avenues available to
keep the channels open?

721
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:42,890
Shri Mataji: To be your Spirit. And we will
let you know later on how to work it out,

722
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:49,400
how to balance yourself, how the imbalances
are there. This I’ll do it on Wednesday.

723
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:55,760
I will tell you how to keep them clear, how
to keep your chakras clear, how to work it

724
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,970
out, everything I’ll tell you. And also
–

725
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:03,640
[We don’t have a book about it, isn’t
it, but in any case –

726
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,000
Warren: We’ve got the “Advent.”

727
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,920
Shri Mataji: Oh yes. ]

728
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:11,400
We have a very big book on this Sahaj Yoga,
which of course we do not sell to everyone,

729
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:18,400
but we’ll see about it. We’ll see about
it because you people are growing very fast.

730
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:23,290
If you people really grow, then we’ll sell
it to you also, but normally we don’t sell

731
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:23,920
it to everyone.

732
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,020
Question: Do you feel Hatha Yoga is necessary?

733
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:34,070
Shri Mataji: Not at all, nothing. On the contrary
Hatha Yoga creates a problem, I told you in

734
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:39,610
the morning, to a lady who was doing Hatha
Yoga. I told her how Hatha Yoga in the modern

735
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:46,610
times means nothing but physical acrobats.
It is not that. Hatha Yoga was practiced about,

736
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:52,230
I don’t know how many years back, about
eight thousand years back, when we had a different

737
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:59,230
system of life, where children from five to
twenty-five lived with a guru who was a realized

738
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:06,350
soul, and led a very celibate life. To such
an extent that, that university, any university

739
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:13,670
– say somebody’s university was Vishwamitra,
then that realized soul was Vishwamitra and

740
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:18,710
that university people could not marry, even
today they cannot marry. Even today they cannot

741
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:23,860
marry each other. The celibacy of that kind
was present in those days. And in that time

742
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:29,410
when you were completely celibate, you were
innocent, you were given these Ashtang Yogas.

743
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:36,410
There are eightfold paths [DEL: of Sahaj]
of this Hatha Yoga, out of which eighth one

744
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:44,110
is Yama-niyama where the discipline and things
are there to maintain a proper life that was

745
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:51,110
given to them. And then after that when that
was done, the maintenance of the proper life

746
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:57,830
and all that was taught, also they were told
the exercises when according to the movement

747
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:01,120
of the Kundalini wherever was the problem.

748
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:07,410
Supposing the problem is in your particular
center, then you have to do that movement,

749
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:12,540
that particular exercise you have to do. But
it’s, as I told you this morning, that your

750
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:17,840
car has not started, you are still at home
and you are paying the toll for what? You

751
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:23,780
must move, to find out where is the obstruction,
then you pay the toll. And nowadays it is

752
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:29,760
so absurd that we take [DEL: the Saha–]
the Hatha Yoga in such a manner that we take

753
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:36,170
the whole medicine box without having any
disease and get diseased. It’s a big science.

754
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:41,580
Is a very big science one has to understand
that everything is correlated: How is your

755
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:46,980
center, which center is catching, what center
requires what kind of treatment, how to clear

756
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,160
it, and this technique you will learn in no
time. It’s very simple, once you get your

757
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:49,410
realization.

758
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:55,590
Question: Is there anything that we can start
doing now?

759
01:17:55,590 --> 01:18:01,490
Shri Mataji: Yes, just now I’m going to
give you realization. All right? That’s

760
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:04,830
it, that’s just like a seeker, just like
a seeker.

761
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:05,140
[Warren: On the sheet it tells them how to
meditate as well.

762
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:05,390
Shri Mataji: Oh that I will tell later.]

763
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,970
Ha. Now what about you? You have been raising
your hand.

764
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:13,970
Question: What kind of a… what kind of a
yoga did Lord Krishna practice?

765
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:20,060
Shri Mataji: Sahaj Yoga. [Shri Mataji chuckles.]

766
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:26,380
Question: According to Yogananda, he said
that Lord Krishna practiced Kriya Yoga.

767
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,520
Shri Mataji: Not at all, Is wrong. He, it
is just to apportion of himself to [INDISTINCT:

768
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:36,520
you.] You see, Shri Krishna, if I have time
I can tell them, He in His Gita, He has prescribed

769
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:43,820
four things. But Krishna was an incarnation
of diplomacy; He was an incarnation of divine

770
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:51,370
diplomacy we should say, because when he told
Arjuna that you find it within yourself, the

771
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:58,490
first thing, – He was not a businessman,
so He told the best thing first. He said,

772
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:03,230
“Find it within yourself the gyana, the
awareness.” In your awareness you should

773
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:09,500
find it, you should find your Spirit, should
become that. This is the first thing He told.

774
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:16,500
But he was, that time a mediocre, an intellectual
I should say, and he said that “You are

775
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:22,490
telling me to fight the war and here You are
saying that you find yourself and you become

776
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:28,090
yourself, and to be a witness!” What Shri
Krishna meant was that you become a witness,

777
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:32,600
then the whole thing becomes a drama, but
he didn’t understand.

778
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:39,600
He, being a father, I give an analogy of a
father who is telling his son that, “The

779
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:45,200
horse is behind the cart, so put the horse
in front so the cart will move.”

780
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,930
But the son is saying that “Why not sitting
down here I move the cart?”

781
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:54,750
So he says, “All right, go ahead.” He
says, “All right, go ahead,” because if

782
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:59,960
you tell them straightforward they don’t
listen to you so tell them in another way.

783
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:06,500
So the diplomacy, as the essence that you
give absurd conditions, such absurd conditions

784
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,890
that people discover later on and find that
it was absurd.

785
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:17,890
So the absurd condition He said that the first
thing you do is to do your karmas, do what

786
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:26,960
you want to do and put it at the lotus feet
of the Lord – is an absurd condition. You

787
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,880
cannot do it because your ego is intact, you
may believe, “I am serving the Lord.”

788
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:39,030
You may believe it, “believe” is different
from reality, you are not. Because ego is

789
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:44,500
there, and that’s why you feel hurt, sometimes
you take the credit. Unless and until you

790
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:51,500
are realized, unless and until you become
a holy personality you’ll never say like

791
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:56,500
that. After realization what do you say, “It’s
going, it’s coming, Mother it’s not working,

792
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,840
it just doesn’t work.” “It,” you start
talking in a third person. You don’t say,

793
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:06,840
“I’m giving you realization,” you don’t
say so. “It’s not working. It has worked.

794
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:08,660
It has come up.”

795
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,050
“What?”

796
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:11,800
”Realization.” You don’t say “I.”

797
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:17,190
So you become an akarmi, means like the sun
shines, it doesn’t say, “I shine.” There

798
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:23,690
is no karma attached, this was the first thing
He said. But this absurdity people never saw,

799
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:27,670
and they – even today people say, “I am
serving the Lord.” But you are not even

800
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:34,670
connected, how are you serving Him? That’s
one thing. Because there is ego, you are identified

801
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:41,760
with ego; actually you are serving your ego.
Unless and until you become realized, you

802
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:47,680
do not serve God. This is one point which
was absurd, He told. Then second point – this

803
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,840
is Karma Yoga.

804
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:55,840
The second point He said was, that “You
should do Bhakti Yoga.” Bhakti Yoga is that

805
01:21:56,420 --> 01:22:02,980
you should worship Him, worship God, pray
to Him. But as usual because He was diplomacy

806
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:08,430
He put a very interesting word called Ananya.
You should do Ananya Bhakti. Ananya means

807
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:15,430
“when there is not the other.” When there
is not the other, when you are not the other,

808
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:22,080
when you are one with God. That means all
those people who are talking, “Hare Rama,

809
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,570
Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare Krishna” on
Oxford Street are not connected. They are

810
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:33,570
spoiling their throat, will get throat cancers.
You are not yet connected, you should be ananya.

811
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:38,860
Ananya means you should be realized; you should
be connected with God.

812
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:45,810
Imagine, supposing your President Reagan,
I go to him and stand before his house and

813
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:49,980
start calling, “Reagan, Reagan, Reagan,”
I’ll be arrested. I must have a proper protocol,

814
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:55,690
I must have proper permission, I should have
a proper way of going there, isn’t it?

815
01:22:55,690 --> 01:23:01,800
Everybody starts calling God as if He’s
in his pocket. “God give me a job, give

816
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:08,800
me money, give me a car, give me this,”
I mean, imagine. You have to be connected

817
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:13,460
with God. That’s what He said very clearly,
“ananya,” but these people, these are

818
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:16,190
blind people they cannot see through.

819
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:23,190
Then the third thing He said that, “It happens
within you that you get these happenings,”

820
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:32,110
is the Kundalini Yoga. He said that when the
Kundalini starts, the jalandhara bhanda and

821
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:38,780
all these bhandas take place when the Kundalini
rises. These granthis go into a particular

822
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:43,640
kind of a formation like a car when you start
all the engines starts moving. So He described

823
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,210
all the engine, how it moves.

824
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:52,050
That, this Mr. Yogananda picked up and he
said He preached Kriya Yoga. That means if

825
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:56,960
you, say, have a car which has stopped which
has not yet started, you move the wheel and

826
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:03,960
you move all the machines, will it work? You
cannot do it. It happens automatically. It

827
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:14,110
is spontaneous happening within us. When we
eat our food how the food is digested? Automatically.

828
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,790
In the same way when Kundalini rises, to support
its rise all these bhandas and all these kriyas

829
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:28,760
take place and kechari, also your tongue is
pulled in, so people they cut their tongues,

830
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:35,650
put it back. Is that the way? Is absolutely
artificial, is stupid.

831
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:42,570
To do like that, many people I have seen.
I don’t know the early ones who came, of

832
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:47,870
Yogananda they had the tongues wagging like
that? Imagine by doing all these things, “take

833
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:54,830
out your eyes, take out your nose.” This
is not the way. And that, “You suffer, you

834
01:24:54,830 --> 01:25:01,830
shave your heads, wear a kind of a cloth,”
you cannot. It’s a thing that’s living

835
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:10,060
within you and acts in a living way. You cannot
just maneuver it artificially, you cannot.

836
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:14,980
It has to start!. Like even this camera, you
see, a television, anything, this has to be

837
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:21,360
put to the mains. You cannot start with your
finger the camera working, can you? The electricity

838
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:28,360
has to be there, in the same way energy of
Kundalini has to be there to work it out.

839
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:34,560
This is absurd.

840
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:41,560
So the Kriya Yoga, which is described by Shri
Krishna, is the living process. He said, “Is

841
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:49,120
the living tree.” I’m surprised. We can…
human beings are very great, I must say, the

842
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:56,120
way they make a pai out of everyone. So all
these great incarnations came on this earth;

843
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:05,040
they wrote it very clearly; they said everything
very clearly; it was very simple; there was

844
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:11,990
nothing to be so much deluded – of course
he used a word like ananya. You see in any

845
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:18,990
dictionary what is the meaning of word ananya
is, mean is “when is there is not the other.”

846
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:26,590
What have we made of Christ, what have we
made of Krishna, what have we made of Rama?

847
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:33,150
When I see this I’m amazed. But you can’t
make anything out of Me, because you will

848
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:40,150
get your realization. After that, if you try
to do anything to Me, you lose your vibrations,

849
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:42,560
straightforward.

850
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,500
I can tell you this much.

851
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:51,500
There was a gentleman who got his realization
from Me, an Indian. Typically he went to New

852
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:58,700
York, started his thing and then in Los Angeles
he started a Sahaj Yoga center, and he came

853
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:05,530
back to see Me in Bombay, and the Sahaj Yogis
told that “He is just giving us a fit. Is

854
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:09,830
horrible. His vibrations are horrible.”

855
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,000
I said, “I know that, you don’t talk to
him.”

856
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,730
So I called him, I said, “What do you do?”

857
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:21,730
“Oh, I have started a big thing there in
Los Angeles and in New York and this and that.”

858
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:28,060
“All right, can I have a brochure?” You
won’t believe he had written, that for ordinary

859
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:35,060
vibrations seventy-five dollars and for extraordinary,
special vibrations hundred and seventy-five

860
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,320
dollars.

861
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:41,510
So I said, “Oh God, what’s this?” I
said, “How do you do this way?”

862
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:45,080
He says, “Yes Mother, that’s [DEL: what]
how we are to do. After all, I have to live.”

863
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:49,810
I said, “You have to live, all right, you
do your work that you were doing. You were

864
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:53,900
teaching something, you do that, but you cannot
sell these vibrations; I didn’t give you

865
01:27:53,900 --> 01:28:00,900
for selling. Did you buy from Me?” And he
wouldn’t believe. And he was very angry

866
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,490
and then he went away.

867
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:08,820
He said, “There’s a guru who is in Calicut,
He’s a very wonderful man.”

868
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,500
I said, “You go and see him.”

869
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,470
He went and saw him, and this guru wouldn’t
allow him to enter into his house. He threw

870
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:19,400
stones at him. He wouldn’t allow him to
enter even the gate. So he went back to the

871
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:25,820
station, so he was sitting down there, then
somebody met him from the guru, he said that

872
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:32,090
“Guru was saying that, ‘he went and insulted
Mother and how does he come to be here? I’ll

873
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:37,290
not see his face.’” Then he sat there
for three days, and he was allowed to go,

874
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:43,600
and then guru sent a very good poem about
Me in Sanskrit language, which he read it

875
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,570
out to Me.

876
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:51,570
But the fellow is just the same still. He’s
not changed; he’s just the same. Now he

877
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:57,090
has no vibrations, he’s not a Sahaj yogi,
he has nothing to do, but he has an ashram,

878
01:28:57,090 --> 01:29:00,250
he’s making money out of it. Of course we
have withdrawn our photographs and everything

879
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:06,080
but he’s just the same, what am I to do?
He is now making them stand on their heads

880
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:12,540
and do all kinds of things. And he has more
people than you are here. That’s the best

881
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:19,540
part of it. People are more attracted to these
things than to reality. Is very true.

882
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:27,340
When I came last time to America there was
a lady. I told her that, “Your guru was

883
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,720
believing in all miracles, and you better
not start it.”

884
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:34,280
She said, “No, no, no, no. I want the ultimate,
I want the parama, I’m not going to go into

885
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:34,640
it.”

886
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,850
I said, “All right. Promise Me.”

887
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:40,970
She said, “Yes.” But then she started
getting some sort of a rice falling from her

888
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:47,190
hand and all that and then she started doing
her things, you see? She called people told

889
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:52,260
them even the name of the horses which are
going to win, all sorts of things. And you

890
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:59,260
won’t believe, when I went back to America
to My most embarrassed condition, I found

891
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:07,360
that she had three thousand disciples falling
at her feet. And she was absolutely possessed.

892
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:11,680
She came to Me and I told her, “What are
you doing?”

893
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,770
She said, “Mother, this is the powers You
have given me.”

894
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:17,780
I said, “I have never given you these powers
to beat people and tell them about horses.

895
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,060
Is absurd.”

896
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:23,360
She said, “But this is happening to me.”

897
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,810
I said, “All supraconscious, all nonsense.”
She wouldn’t listen. I said, “All right,

898
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:32,450
tell this gentleman about his future.”

899
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:37,390
She told him something. He said , “It’s
all wrong, it’s not true.”

900
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,810
I said, “Tell this lady.” She couldn’t
tell.

901
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:45,090
So she said, “Mother, have you taken away
my powers?”

902
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:47,420
I said, “If they were your powers, I would
have garlanded, I would have worshiped you,

903
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:52,260
but they are not yours, they have gone, finished.”
But she would not give up, you see popularity,

904
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:58,400
she was on with it. Now only thing is she’s
in a lunatic asylum.

905
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:05,400
So all these things they do, they know how
to make these things, they are so superficial.

906
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:14,670
They don’t know what injuries they are doing
to themselves and to others.

907
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:19,990
Now, who were asking some question?

908
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:26,990
Man. I wanted to ask You about the meditations
from the Maharishi Mahayoga, what Your opinion

909
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,550
was.

910
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:36,930
Shri Mataji: Now again the controversy, again
the controversy, the less said the better.

911
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:39,000
All right?

912
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,090
Man: The what?

913
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:47,090
Shri Mataji: The less said the better. For
example, the mantras he gives you. You know

914
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:53,790
what they mean, one of them, inga ? It means
“the tail of the scorpion.” Now where

915
01:31:53,790 --> 01:32:00,270
is the scorpion and where is the tail? When
the Kundalini has started, then you should

916
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:06,050
know which center it is catching and what
mantra to be said. It is not that you can

917
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:13,050
just give a mantra and charge three hundred
pounds, and people do pay. And this flying

918
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:17,400
squad that he has started, the head of that
flying squad here he is, is sitting down here,

919
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:22,550
he will tell you. The head of that where he
went and learnt from him flying, so called,

920
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:26,230
he suffered from epilepsy, his wife suffered
from epilepsy, his daughter suffered from

921
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:33,230
epilepsy, and they came to Me and they wrote
to him about Me, in that miserable condition.

922
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:38,690
He was the head; he was going to teach them
flying.

923
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:43,280
I told him, “Why don’t you ask your guru
to go on this leaning tower of Pisa and make

924
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:50,280
him fly? And you pay him some money for that,
will be good idea.” They paid three thousand

925
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:58,520
pounds for flying. You are not going to become
birds now, are you?

926
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:05,630
But it is very difficult, you know, to accept
really because you have paid so much money.

927
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:11,410
This is like, “We have paid it, so better
have it.” You see whatever… Like you go

928
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:18,410
to a restaurant and you pay for it, and may
be bad but you eat it. You see, after all,

929
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,550
you have paid for it.

930
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:24,780
That’s human nature, isn’t it? Oh, it’s
terrible. It’s terrible, and difficult to

931
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:29,210
give realization to people from all these
gurus, I can tell you, Yogananda… or this,

932
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:32,450
what’s his name is? This Bhandasura’s
name, what is his name?

933
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,040
Warren: Muktananda.

934
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:40,040
Shri Mataji: Muktananda. I know them very
well, I know them. I’ve known them for ages,

935
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,880
and they know Me too.

936
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,600
Yes?

937
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:54,600
Lady: Are there other sources where you can
reach your realization other than through

938
01:33:58,920 --> 01:33:59,170
You?

939
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,130
[Warren repeats the question.]

940
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:04,020
Shri Mataji: Through Me? It’s not a question
of through Me or anything; it’s through

941
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:06,310
your Kundalini, is your Kundalini within you.

942
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:08,880
Lady: Is there someone else that can guide
you or…?

943
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:13,530
Shri Mataji: I don’t know, I haven’t seen
many. I wish somebody could, like – you

944
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:18,990
see people are very much hurt to see that
I’m doing it. I said, “Baba, you do it.

945
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:21,090
I’ll be very happy to retire, really.”

946
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:22,610
They said, “Why You, Mother?”

947
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:27,710
I said, “Really, I don’t know why I was
chosen for this. It’s a thankless job. You

948
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:34,710
must have tremendous patience, I tell you.
The day I retire my husband will pay you for

949
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:39,630
that. I can assure you.”

950
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:46,630
He’s telling Me that “You are trying to
put patches to the heavens which are falling.”

951
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:54,790
He doesn’t believe that I can do it. Is
a thankless job, absolutely a thankless job.

952
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,950
But what to do?

953
01:34:58,950 --> 01:35:05,950
Once I did feel little frustrated, and I said,
“Let it be now. Doesn’t matter, let the

954
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:13,460
destruction come in.” And then you know
this clever man, he brought a photograph of

955
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:18,820
Mine, with My eyes so compassionate, such
compassion flowing, I said, “Better do it.

956
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:25,090
It’s You, what can You do? You can’t get
out of it, that’s what You are.”

957
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:31,220
So I have to do it, My children, I have to
do it. If you could do it, I’ll be very

958
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:36,570
happy. Any one, I’ll be extremely happy
and retire.

959
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:42,290
Warren softly: Other Sahaja Yogis can.

960
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:49,290
Shri Mataji: Ha, Of course! Other Sahaj yogis
can give you realization. For example Warren

961
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:55,090
himself has given realization to I don’t
know how many thousand. But I know of a person

962
01:35:55,090 --> 01:36:01,450
who has given realization to more than ten
thousand people, in India. Yes! Yes, yes,

963
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:05,710
you can give realization, you can give it,
all right?

964
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:12,330
Man: Is the lotus position any special advantage
over sitting normally?

965
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:15,550
Warren: Is the lotus position any special
advantage?

966
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:21,850
Shri Mataji: Not in Sahaj Yoga, not in Sahaj
Yoga. You see now God has decided to give

967
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:27,920
you in any position you sit; He has to save
His creation. Many people can’t even sit

968
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:33,370
on the ground, so they are not to be forced
now. Whatever position you have, you are all

969
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:40,230
right. You drink, all right. You take drugs,
all right. You are a thief, all right. Any

970
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:47,230
kind, come along. Once you get realization
these things will drop out. This is the trick.

971
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:55,380
Better come along and have it. There’s no
position required, nothing required, only

972
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:21,750
the desire to 
be the Spirit, that’s all.

973
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:03,560
First one man: We’ll take it.

974
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:22,570
[several people start to echo the request:
“We’ll take it.”]

975
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,460
Warren: They want it.

976
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:39,540
Shri Mataji: Now they want it, that’s all.

977
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:43,020
Man: May we have it.

978
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:50,020
Shri Mataji: So, that’s all, that’s the
best way. All right?

979
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:48,670
Now those who got 

980
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:47,240
it yesterday are here, some of them, and those
who have come for 

981
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:29,860
the first time are also here.

982
01:44:36,190 --> 01:44:43,190
Two ladies: what’s wrong with that? What
was that again?

983
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:14,550
Warren: They just want 
You 
to repeat that, “those that have..”

984
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:44,270
Shri Mataji: No, yesterday some people got
realization and 

985
01:49:56,420 --> 01:50:03,420
some of 

986
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:13,380
you are new people. We’ll have to, later
on, see them, those who are new. And those

987
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:48,280
who got realization, specially yesterday,
I 
would like to meet them. As yesterday I couldn’t

988
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:06,950
meet them. So I would like to meet them and
those who are new, also we’ll if we can

989
01:52:57,990 --> 01:53:04,990
work it out…

990
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:40,810
