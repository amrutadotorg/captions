00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.760
Today on this auspicious day of Rakhipurnima, we have to thank all the artists who have

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:29.240
really created such a marvelous, beautiful dance drama in your presence, especially to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.240
Mr. Pawar, his wife, his daughter, you are very much obliged, plus the other artist,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.240
and so on.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:54.960
Shri Markandey Mishra, and also Baluji Shrivastava, all these people have shown very great artistic

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.480
talent today, and it's a very special day.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.480
On this day, we all, as brothers and sisters, are sitting here to watch something so beautifully

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.800
expressed in the realm of brotherly and sisterly love.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.640
So whatever has gone wrong or is better, we all must learn to forgive, that's important.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.880
And the sister always forgives, we all must forgive, and we should be extremely loving

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.760
and protective, that is the Raksha for our artist who are in England.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.480
I feel sometimes that the people who have come from abroad and who are artists in England

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.920
are to be looked after in the same way all the artists of the world must be looked after

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.120
and must be encouraged and nourished and cherished so that they take to proper divine manifestation

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.760
of divine music and drama, everything that is beautiful and pure.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.160
So on this day, I especially would like to bless all of them for a higher ascent and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:13.320
in a greater way to express themselves in full ecstasy, the joy of God's blessings on

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:23.120
them as artist and on the listeners and the Sahaja Yogis who are here, a very great report

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.360
with them, a great report to understand the artists are needing your help in every way

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
of understanding them.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.120
They have worked very hard for ages to achieve this.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.080
The second thing is that today is such a great day that you must accept Pawar, all the girls

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.560
of Sahaja Yoginis have to accept Him as a brother and Mrs. Pawar is the sister of

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.000
all the Sahaja Yogis and we have other artists also as brothers and I'm also very happy to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.480
announce the engagement of His daughter, Ashaavani and also we have two great artists,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.160
one is the son of Mr. Pawar and our, as you know, from Sahaja Yogis who dance so well,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.694
so congratulations to Him also.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:33.080
Last of all we must thank Pedro for organizing all this so well.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.080
Despite the fact she was not well, they danced so well, put their heart into it and they

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.160
made us enjoy it.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.240
Now there's a program on the 10th they're having and I hope you'll make it convenient

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.760
to see that program which will be very beautifully done, he's also getting more artists from

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760
Glasgow.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.840
I hope all of you will make it convenient and ask your other friends to come in to understand

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.880
other art forms also.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.600
You have to understand and appreciate other art forms.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.600
Now you have tap dancing but you can see tap dancing is nothing compared to this.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.320
You can see it, one must admit, there's nothing to feel bad about it.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.760
You are good at other things but they are good at certain things so we should appreciate

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.640
good of everyone and every art and this is what it is that I want you to understand that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.720
if you have to be universal you must have an universal mind to understand all that is

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.960
beautifully created in the whole universe unless and until you understand that you cannot

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.760
grow, you cannot grow wider.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.760
So the appreciation of every type of art form is to be appreciated, whether it is Indian,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.040
English, American or even African, all sorts of art forms which are divine must be appreciated.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.600
This is the only condition that they should be divine, that's the only condition we have

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.680
to apply and by God's grace I'm sure everything will work out very well and one day we will

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.520
all have a nice report with them as brothers and sisters as we today we have done it on

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.960
such an auspicious day.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.320
May God bless you, all the blessings on you.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:29:20.960
May God bless you, all the blessings on you.
