00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.449
AI GENERATED. Has to be taken up otherwise I tell you.

1
00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:09.470
Some of you will start looking like orange z or.

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.899
Genghis Khan.

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.880
For Hitler.

4
00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.139
Or something like that,

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.469
see,

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.909
all these,

7
00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:21.569
you suddenly I find among suchies

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.700
some Hitler standing with the moustache

9
00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.489
and the hair like that,

10
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.340
the nose like that.

11
00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.119
But suddenly I find someone like that.

12
00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:35.880
It's quite possible.

13
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.479
I mean

14
00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:39.880
what I have seen of Sergio guy in the west,

15
00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:41.560
I'm surprised to see.

16
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.799
You leave somebody as a little sparrow,

17
00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:45.750
and when you come back,

18
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.790
you find a hawk.

19
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.439
That the same person.

20
00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:51.099
Yes,

21
00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.509
now she's become aha.

22
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.630
Only possible

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.830
in the west,

24
00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:59.830
I can tell you.

25
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.139
If you tell somebody in India,

26
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.139
they will not believe.

27
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.550
Like Mister Jekyll and Mister Hyde,

28
00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:08.699
only possible

29
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.940
in the West.

30
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.230
When I read this story,

31
00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.589
I said,

32
00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:12.779
how can it be possible.

33
00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:16.690
Doctor Jekyll and Mr.

34
00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:16.989
Hyde,

35
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.269
I said,

36
00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:18.379
how can it be possible?

37
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.660
But I've seen it.

38
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.519
It happens here

39
00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:24.449
They,

40
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.589
when they are good,

41
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.300
they're very,

42
00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:27.099
very good,

43
00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:29.059
and when they're bad,

44
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.040
they're horrid.

45
00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:34.239
But that's only in the West.

46
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.830
You don't find this

47
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.989
in India.

48
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.529
Why?

49
00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.989
The reason is we are deep.

50
00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:42.790
Into ourselves really deep.

51
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.089
All right,

52
00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:46.610
you have not missed anything now.

53
00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.889
Because you got your realisation as they've got it,

54
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.099
you've got the knowledge of surgery as they've got it.

55
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.580
But test it upon yourself.

56
00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:57.900
And humble down yourself.

57
00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.019
Go down into yourself

58
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.059
facing yourself.

59
00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:03.080
Just

60
00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:04.150
telling yourself,

61
00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.459
no,

62
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.910
I have to agree deeper and deeper.

63
00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:08.949
I'm not going to listen to anything.

64
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.169
Ego and all that nonsense.

65
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.059
I'm not going to listen.

66
00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.460
I'm going to go deeper into.

67
00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:16.330
And move into yourself,

68
00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.289
ed yourself

69
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.619
into reality.

70
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.419
Piercing through all these ego or nonsensical ideas that come.

71
00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.440
Then only you can correct it,

72
00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.259
otherwise you can.

73
00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.800
The best way in meditation I've seen to improve your ego

74
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.559
is to meditate on my feet.

75
00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.250
My feet

76
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.410
Have that magic.

77
00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.139
Have you got photographs of my feet?

78
00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.220
I don't find anything here.

79
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.520
Yeah,

80
00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:01.289
we just bring one,

81
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.220
just bring one.

82
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.080
All right,

83
00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:10.130
watch that.

84
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.789
They're very small one this one this is this is not this kind,

85
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.580
one.

86
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.429
Ah,

87
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.309
see.

88
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.919
A place.

89
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.850
So

90
00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.419
Ah,

91
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.360
that's it.

92
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.259
They are reflecting too much though the light,

93
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.550
huh.

94
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.679
Can we take out this?

95
00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:28.799
Yet lots of these small kinds they have.

96
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.790
Change

97
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.779
Later

98
00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.470
Mm.

99
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.070
Now the 2nd group can come in.

100
00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:07.540
Are you all right now?

101
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.029
Better.

102
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.540
Still there.

103
00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.619
Beat yourself with shoes.

104
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.540
I tell you,

105
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.459
beat yourself with shoes.

106
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.500
That's the best way,

107
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.089
go and beat yourself with shoes,

108
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.369
all of you.

109
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:20.290
Now those

110
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.959
come and

111
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.130
just.

112
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.359
P

113
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.649
Very simple feat.

114
00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:36.489
All the people at the back come right in.

115
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.619
Get some Puja ones also,

116
00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390
yeah.

117
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.390
No need to rub my feet.

118
00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:15.709
You can just wash them.

119
00:07:23.859 --> 00:07:23.869
Mm.

120
00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:28.660
Can you feel the vibration?

121
00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:30.070
Right

122
00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:41.200
Well,

123
00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.720
let's have the 2nd group coming down.

124
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.640
Please move out

125
00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:02.820
Have you got kumkum here?

126
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.899
Bring it.

127
00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:07.209
Those who have not rubbed my feet can rub with the kumum with who died.

128
00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:11.019
Those who have not rubbed my feet

129
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.700
so far should wait,

130
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.619
and,

131
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.140
uh,

132
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.359
others can meditate a little bit on the feet.

133
00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:30.290
God bless her.

134
00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:06.840
rough.

135
00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:18.190
Ah,

136
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:18.219
but he.

137
00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:30.979
Can you feel the vibrations now the cool breeze.

138
00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:39.260
Put it in a

139
00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:40.750
a or something.

140
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:41.580
Put it in a mixer.

141
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.090
hm,

142
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.650
now,

143
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.820
all right,

144
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.070
good.

145
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.690
Chris,

146
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:49.500
how are you?

147
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.380
Better

148
00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:56.840
Now those who want to come further,

149
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:57.489
come up.

150
00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:00.299
Allow some others to come for.

151
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.760
It's.

152
00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:29.450
or just what.

153
00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:51.549
Are you better now.

154
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.590
got it.

155
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:56.929
So.

156
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.309
No,

157
00:11:01.429 --> 00:11:01.950
just try,

158
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:02.880
just

159
00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:03.559
try,

160
00:11:03.659 --> 00:11:03.859
yeah.

161
00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:19.869
Did you use the ice?

162
00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:21.770
It helped you

163
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.619
It's right-sided probably.

164
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.080
Stomach or you did it

165
00:11:32.669 --> 00:11:33.340
on the liver.

166
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:36.020
Hm.

167
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.330
That also helps

168
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.830
Released

169
00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:45.789
My breathing is all right.

170
00:11:53.109 --> 00:11:53.510
Regina,

171
00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:54.179
you sit here.

172
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.909
Don't close your eyes.

173
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:49.940
Hello,

174
00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:50.679
for me.

175
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.260
This is in me.

176
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.219
Mm

177
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.150
No

178
00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:31.000
Um,

179
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.059
feet,

180
00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:32.460
feet.

181
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:33.400
But

182
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.309
You cannot think about them.

183
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.429
You just have to see it.

184
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:07.520
Oh,

185
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:29.840
Hm.

186
00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:38.580
Now,

187
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.530
another group,

188
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.780
all of you have been.

189
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:41.520
All right?

190
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.599
All of you all right?

191
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:43.969
No.

192
00:14:45.479 --> 00:14:48.429
Those who have not rubbed my feet before.

193
00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:50.559
Some

194
00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:53.530
It

195
00:14:56.609 --> 00:14:58.460
Or not had done my poojas.

196
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.599
Come,

197
00:15:00.729 --> 00:15:01.080

400
00:29:42.729 --> 00:29:42.739
No,

401
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.800

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.000
San Francisco.

403
00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:47.859
He's going to India.

405
00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:06.869
Others.

Yeah.

Right

418
00:30:45.849 --> 00:30:45.880
It's

419
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:17.339
any nationality preference for you to marry outside of the US?

420
00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:19.270
Or

421
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.030
Canada,

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:20.630
yes.

423
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.579
To marry any nationality,

424
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:24.439
yes.

425
00:31:24.709 --> 00:31:27.550
Is there any nationality you don't want to marry?

426
00:31:30.829 --> 00:31:32.430
I mean he's seen everything.

427
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.219
Is there any particular person whom you want to marry?

428
00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:39.089
Yes,

429
00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:39.109
OK,

430
00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:39.160

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.430
I see.

432
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:45.800
That's great.

433
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640
Yeah.

434
00:32:06.729 --> 00:32:07.270
she's blushing.

435
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.410
But where is he?

436
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.760
Where is he going?

437
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.859
Where is he,

438
00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:17.229
mother,

00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:18.060

00:32:18.949 --> 00:32:20.310
he's uh out in California.

441
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.300
He could get here.

442
00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.829
And ready to meet that girl.

443
00:32:28.949 --> 00:32:29.439
Gale

444
00:32:31.329 --> 00:32:32.369
Where did you meet her?

445
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.810
Where did you

446
00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:40.400
a few years ago.

447
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:42.599
Oh,

448
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.430
that's great.

449
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:45.530
All right,

450
00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:47.219
that's very beautiful.

451
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.689
So it's so this one is so this one's on.

452
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.770
This is him,

453
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:03.400
Phil,

454
00:33:03.569 --> 00:33:04.439
this is Phil.

455
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.199
He couldn't get a photograph,

456
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.010
but seeing as his uh wife's

457
00:33:08.369 --> 00:33:08.800

458
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:09.410
here.

459
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.180
She has a photograph of herself.

460
00:33:13.959 --> 00:33:13.969
Ah,

461
00:33:14.949 --> 00:33:16.270
you brought 10 good.

462
00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:26.699
Director

463
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.119
Of Broadway studios New York.

464
00:33:33.109 --> 00:33:37.819
It make they make films.

465
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:40.329
the director.

466
00:33:42.069 --> 00:33:42.739
Oh,

467
00:33:42.949 --> 00:33:43.780
that's good.

468
00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:45.989
Now we should make one film of Seekers,

469
00:33:46.069 --> 00:33:46.560
all right.

470
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:50.020
You

471
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.239
His desire to humility it's wonderful.

472
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.400
Now see your vibrations,

473
00:33:58.489 --> 00:33:59.400
both of you.

474
00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:00.760
First of all,

475
00:34:01.489 --> 00:34:02.359
beautiful.

476
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.489
May God bless you.

477
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.989
I should put one more point.

478
00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.270
Have you been to any guru?

479
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:21.938
That's important.

480
00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:23.070
We have that on this form.

481
00:34:25.759 --> 00:34:26.099
Now,

482
00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:26.858
just see,

483
00:34:27.158 --> 00:34:28.509

484
00:34:29.178 --> 00:34:29.759
Let's see.

485
00:34:32.728 --> 00:34:33.310
Better

486
00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:41.139
How are you?

487
00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:45.139
Uh

488
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:53.110
Uh,

489
00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:54.649
yes,

490
00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:55.290
I do.

491
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.169
I'll put it on your head.

492
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.409
It would be good for us.

493
00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:14.449
All right,

494
00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:15.699
that's fine,

495
00:35:15.939 --> 00:35:16.649
excellent.

496
00:35:19.989 --> 00:35:20.229
Oh man.

497
00:35:24.879 --> 00:35:25.729
Richard

498
00:35:26.439 --> 00:35:27.250
is American.

499
00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:31.399
37

500
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.929
Are you still nursing,

501
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.550
Richard Richard?

502
00:35:55.429 --> 00:35:56.689
Are you still nursing?

503
00:35:56.949 --> 00:35:57.030
Yes,

504
00:35:57.149 --> 00:35:57.310
I,

505
00:35:57.389 --> 00:35:58.899
I do it part time.

506
00:36:16.459 --> 00:36:18.189
In that you would like to marry?

507
00:36:18.649 --> 00:36:19.020
Yes ma'am.

508
00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:21.010
That's good.

509
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:24.080
Mm

510
00:36:38.169 --> 00:36:38.600
Great

511
00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:40.530
Yes we have

512
00:36:44.659 --> 00:36:45.629
Is he here,

513
00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:46.969
Edward.

514
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:52.469
Canadian

515
00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:54.689
I

516
00:36:56.419 --> 00:36:59.570
Some people couldn't come through much as you lack of space

517
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:02.209
in that sense.

518
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.560
He's so tall as 6 ft.

519
00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:07.159
Oh,

520
00:37:56.229 --> 00:37:57.800
What's the meaning of tardy.

521
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.510
late

522
00:38:01.719 --> 00:38:03.300
A person who's always late,

523
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:04.709
like me.

524
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.919
You have a different way of doing it a different purpose.

525
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:11.879
Distracted

526
00:38:12.429 --> 00:38:13.689
Often distracted,

527
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.810
that attention is

528
00:38:15.219 --> 00:38:15.860
easily

529
00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:16.979
taken away from.

530
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.489
Daydreaming.

531
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.260
It's.

532
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:28.070
Is he?

533
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:30.820
He's improved.

534
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.060
Laurie Hynes,

535
00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:34.500
uh,

536
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.100
person,

537
00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:37.340
he's in the ashram there in,

538
00:38:37.459 --> 00:38:39.120
in Vancouver,

539
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.870
but he's had an up and down history.

540
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.439
So we'll find it somebody.

541
00:38:44.949 --> 00:38:45.780
It's very good.

542
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.580
Godfrey in San Diego.

543
00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:29.179
point

544
00:39:57.639 --> 00:39:58.550
She has children.

545
00:39:59.520 --> 00:39:59.899
Uh,

546
00:39:59.959 --> 00:40:00.149
yes,

547
00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:00.310
ma'am.

548
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.560
Is he here?

549
00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:04.139
No.

550
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.610
Again another case of vaccine.

551
00:40:08.729 --> 00:40:09.780
They uh

552
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.580
With saving to go to India.

553
00:40:14.439 --> 00:40:14.449
Mm

554
00:40:16.189 --> 00:40:20.060
And I think the difference between flying here and there may make.

555
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.469
may make the difference whether you can go to India.

556
00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:27.370
So

557
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.989
they didn't know you were

558
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.000
gonna be here,

559
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.409
mother.

560
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.479
At first it was Warren and they,

561
00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:34.989
Warren was gonna go to their San Diego.

562
00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:43.939
Christine.

563
00:40:49.649 --> 00:40:50.429
We have done

564
00:40:57.639 --> 00:40:58.729
Janet Bows.

565
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:02.739
Jeannette.

566
00:41:04.439 --> 00:41:04.629
the

567
00:41:05.909 --> 00:41:06.679
Oh good.

568
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:07.790
Hm.

569
00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:20.510
They're all filmmakers here.

570
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:22.939
She she brought them,

571
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:23.159
uh,

572
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.590
Phil and Christine and all these other filmmakers

573
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.310
from the department where she works for.

574
00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.389
Now what's that.

575
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:54.229
Christine,

576
00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:54.570
could you

577
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:57.090
Good

578
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.679
If you have gone to sleep.

579
00:42:04.459 --> 00:42:05.479
Left sided feet.

580
00:42:08.919 --> 00:42:09.159
Yes,

581
00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:10.370
a very good person extremely.

582
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.620
30 years of age.

583
00:42:28.899 --> 00:42:30.260
For some streets.

584
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.429
Elizabeth

585
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.520
And she's she said,

586
00:42:38.379 --> 00:42:38.540
yes,

587
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.330
I met her.

588
00:42:39.939 --> 00:42:41.330
I know I don't her.

589
00:42:50.129 --> 00:42:51.209
She has children.

590
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:52.770
Uh,

591
00:42:52.879 --> 00:42:53.000
no,

592
00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:53.320
mother,

593
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.530
she's never been married.

594
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:09.810
I

595
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:11.350
Hm.

596
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:15.510
Caroline,

597
00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:16.610
I would like to marry.

598
00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.510
Did you hear that?

599
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:31.129
I said,

600
00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:32.810
I would like to marry you now.

601
00:43:35.129 --> 00:43:35.719
Myself.

602
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:44.860
We are so good.

603
00:43:53.149 --> 00:43:53.159
Ah,

604
00:43:54.939 --> 00:43:56.050
that's so good.

605
00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:33.739
divorced.

606
00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:37.780
To

607
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.360
You divorced and he divorced.

608
00:44:46.979 --> 00:44:47.870
Is he married?

609
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:48.709
huh?

610
00:44:50.219 --> 00:44:50.620
Mm,

611
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.129
does he?

612
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:52.370
Not bad.

613
00:44:53.939 --> 00:44:55.610
I don't want to give you another chance.

614
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.300
How do you find him?

615
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.080
Be

616
00:45:10.209 --> 00:45:11.620
Why not try Sergio.

617
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:14.510
Mm.

618
00:45:16.919 --> 00:45:21.270
Better try because I am saying your children must be missing the father.

619
00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:22.340
Oh,

620
00:45:22.379 --> 00:45:22.870
they have their they have grown up,

621
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.479
huh.

622
00:45:28.229 --> 00:45:32.389
25 and 23 years old in professions of their own.

623
00:45:33.689 --> 00:45:37.090
They're all working professionally in fields,

624
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.110
economics.

625
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.379
Father.

626
00:45:45.379 --> 00:45:46.889
Why not try him again,

627
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.060
all right?

628
00:45:49.449 --> 00:45:50.550
I have a feeling

629
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.909
he's a good man.

630
00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.909
He may come to search you.

631
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.810
All right,

632
00:46:02.939 --> 00:46:04.659
that would be a unique thing.

633
00:46:08.409 --> 00:46:09.179
You know my ego

634
00:46:11.419 --> 00:46:11.540
No,

635
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.639
it's not that.

636
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.389
I think

637
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.000
Now you are very.

638
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:21.570
Right,

639
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.510
try.

640
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:26.020
So

641
00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.060
That would be the best.

642
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:31.689
I'll be very happy

643
00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:32.820
because it's,

644
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.229
it's a new precedent

645
00:46:34.629 --> 00:46:35.550
for people

646
00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.739
to show that those who are divorced again can remarry

647
00:46:40.709 --> 00:46:41.699
because after

648
00:46:42.389 --> 00:46:43.459
realisation,

649
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.270
a person gets completely transformed.

650
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.979
I start seeing the beauty of another person with a different rank.

651
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.679
I

652
00:46:53.889 --> 00:46:56.300
And all the hurts and all those past things are.

653
00:47:05.639 --> 00:47:05.649
Hm.

654
00:47:10.219 --> 00:47:10.540
Lee.

655
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:11.300
Yeah,

656
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:11.320
OK,

657
00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:14.649
yeah.

658
00:47:18.729 --> 00:47:19.229
Yeah.

659
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.370
But only in India is possible,

660
00:47:24.409 --> 00:47:24.689
Warren,

661
00:47:24.729 --> 00:47:25.560
what he said.

662
00:47:26.189 --> 00:47:27.639
Be a master like this just

663
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.520
falling at my feet like that,

664
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:30.570
only in India.

665
00:47:31.409 --> 00:47:31.830
Ah

666
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:47.959
Steve

667
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.899
In 4 notes she took all that in 4 notes.

668
00:48:02.469 --> 00:48:05.159
I think all of you should learn little Indian music.

669
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.699
It gives you

670
00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.050
a basic

671
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.510
understanding of music as it is.

672
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:20.699
Right.

673
00:48:32.969 --> 00:48:33.199
I

674
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:47.750
Oh

675
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:26.679
This song,

676
00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.669
he must have sung at least 100 times.

677
00:49:29.429 --> 00:49:30.820
Every time a different time.

678
00:49:40.949 --> 00:49:40.959
But

679
00:49:45.909 --> 00:49:45.979
Bagoujana.

680
00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:51.280
It was without any shrada.

681
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.260
How how is the

682
00:49:54.639 --> 00:49:55.300
emotions?

683
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:56.820
There are no emotions in it,

684
00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:58.379
then how will you

685
00:49:58.629 --> 00:49:59.070
go?

686
00:50:00.199 --> 00:50:01.469
Beyond the

687
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:03.030
Maasagara,

688
00:50:03.439 --> 00:50:05.070
beyond the ocean of Iluja.

689
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:08.320
Oh

690
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.310
Saba is all Kare is do.

691
00:50:14.989 --> 00:50:18.270
We all do pilgrimage or the Deva Puja,

692
00:50:18.719 --> 00:50:20.189
and not thee with the

693
00:50:20.399 --> 00:50:20.909
heart.

694
00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:38.600
But

695
00:51:24.989 --> 00:51:25.929
Watson on our money.

696
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:27.030
Was,

697
00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.080
but the greed

698
00:51:30.439 --> 00:51:31.989
and the dust doesn't die.

699
00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:33.830
So what's the use?

700
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.989
How will you cross the illusion?

701
00:51:38.739 --> 00:51:40.449
Just going to pilgrimages

702
00:51:40.979 --> 00:51:42.169
and worshipping God.

703
00:53:30.399 --> 00:53:31.159
Whenever I speak,

704
00:53:31.239 --> 00:53:33.000
you people catch on left to Shudi.

705
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.030
That's very bad.

706
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.459
I didn't say anything

707
00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.280
like that.

708
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:39.810
I was making you laugh all the time.

709
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:45.469
That's also bootish,

710
00:53:45.479 --> 00:53:45.790
I think,

711
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.179
isn't it,

712
00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:47.510
to catch on to such points.

713
00:54:11.139 --> 00:54:11.500
My God.

714
00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:28.449
Might be cabiras Kabiras.

715
00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:43.320
He says that

716
00:54:43.479 --> 00:54:43.760
you,

717
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.840
they wash themselves very well in India,

718
00:54:45.919 --> 00:54:46.350
especially,

719
00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:46.790
you see,

720
00:54:47.199 --> 00:54:48.520
they wash their body very well,

721
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.070
they wash everything very well.

722
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.239
What about inside is not washed.

723
00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:28.780
Should be the other way down,

724
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:29.290
you see.

725
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.139
Where can you take out vibrations.

726
00:56:32.629 --> 00:56:33.760
You have to see this too much.

727
00:56:35.919 --> 00:56:36.830
Can you put it

728
00:56:36.959 --> 00:56:37.199
here,

729
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:37.709
this side,

730
00:56:37.719 --> 00:56:38.179
the light.

731
00:56:42.389 --> 00:56:42.479
The

732
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:46.340
Beautiful.

733
00:56:46.969 --> 00:56:48.780
Such big ones I've not seen before.

734
00:56:55.649 --> 00:56:55.689
What's that?

735
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.530
huh?

736
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:09.080
I settle down with the 2nd 1.

737
00:57:15.989 --> 00:57:16.000
Yes.

738
00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:16.189
Yes,

739
00:57:16.479 --> 00:57:17.850
it's very much.

740
00:57:19.439 --> 00:57:19.459
Is

741
00:57:20.629 --> 00:57:22.020
uh icement

742
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:23.790
so.

743
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:26.449
And everything becomes

744
00:57:26.919 --> 00:57:30.439
uh in the EPS stage you start seeing everything in the week.

745
00:57:31.979 --> 00:57:32.260
No I understand.

746
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.120
You know,

747
00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:07.360
The one in Pandarpura.

748
00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:13.209
All in all Maharashtras are devoted to Pandavpur because according to them,

749
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:15.040
Shri Krishna came and stayed there.

750
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:17.479
So the one who stayed in Pandarina.

751
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.469
Where there's my friend.

752
00:58:22.229 --> 00:58:22.260
Loose

753
00:58:25.209 --> 00:58:25.229
secret stuff.

754
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:35.780
He sang this to you on your birthday celebration.

755
00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.389
He sang this to you on your birthday celebration.

756
00:58:39.229 --> 00:58:40.300
It's different now,

757
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:43.600
and much better.

758
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:18.129
Yeah.

759
00:59:48.979 --> 00:59:48.989
Yeah.

760
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:54.580
Why

761
01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:02.000
Yeah.

762
01:00:08.159 --> 01:00:08.469
Oh

763
01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:15.669
Kagaga.

764
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:18.360
F

765
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:25.080
No.

766
01:00:35.209 --> 01:00:35.320
I

767
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.050
At least sugar would be good because of that.

768
01:00:42.229 --> 01:00:43.760
Or some Diet Coke.

769
01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:44.340
All right.

770
01:00:44.469 --> 01:00:45.139
Have you got

771
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.790
Diet Coke.

772
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:49.909
It's burning.

773
01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:52.139
See,

774
01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:53.570
I don't eat very hot things.

775
01:00:53.739 --> 01:00:54.899
Normally Indians like it,

776
01:00:54.909 --> 01:00:55.659
but not me.

777
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.489
That's good.

778
01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:08.719
So

779
01:01:13.689 --> 01:01:14.030
don't.

780
01:01:21.149 --> 01:01:21.620
See

781
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:25.610
Left suggest is a permanent cat,

782
01:01:26.169 --> 01:01:27.590

cat

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:39.979
Adler.

786
01:01:48.899 --> 01:01:49.169
Take it off.

787
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:55.860
Is the la la.

788
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:56.820
Khawari

01:01:59.699 --> 01:02:00.360
Supporter.

Where are you taking your house?

796
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:41.179
In a place called Mount Vernon.

797
01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.070
It's just not.

798
01:02:48.169 --> 01:02:50.080
It's away from here it's far away.

799
01:02:51.129 --> 01:02:52.229
Too far away.

800
01:02:52.399 --> 01:02:52.560
Good,

801
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.070

Wow.

No.

808
01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.050
Combination of left

01:04:30.639 --> 01:04:30.689
left yeah yes this is.

810
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.929
My daughter's little baby is sucking that one all the time.

811
01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:36.709
All the time

812
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:39.560
Yeah

813
01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:33.330
Uh

814
01:05:36.179 --> 01:05:36.189
just.

815
01:05:52.139 --> 01:05:53.489
Ragbalubalungale changing ragas.

816
01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:57.540
Poor May's baby.

817
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.580
I think children must be catching from you all,

818
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.179
that's why they don't want to sit in the.

819
01:06:03.729 --> 01:06:04.610
I on the surgery.

820
01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.810
You're looking better.

821
01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.199
Except for

822
01:06:27.659 --> 01:06:28.530
Collectivity

823
01:06:30.389 --> 01:06:30.889
Yes.

824
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:46.649
He

825
01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:16.939
Well

826
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:42.000
Make tan.

827
01:07:50.899 --> 01:07:52.000
He's saying that,

828
01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:52.600
Krishna,

829
01:07:52.679 --> 01:07:53.510
you have

830
01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.989
paid the debts of many before.

831
01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:58.550
Bo ourselves many.

832
01:08:08.629 --> 01:08:08.639
Wow.

833
01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:27.339
It.

834
01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:41.290
Michael,

835
01:08:41.339 --> 01:08:42.040
what are you doing?

836
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:42.970
What work?

837
01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:43.770
Same thing.

838
01:08:45.509 --> 01:08:47.509
We're installing telecommunications.

839
01:08:48.877 --> 01:08:49.969
stolen telephone

840
01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:52.560
Sophisticated tele for

841
01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:55.540
Better restore yourself also.

842
01:08:57.009 --> 01:08:57.950
A guy's terrible.

843
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.169
Fundalini doesn't go above this.

844
01:09:07.627 --> 01:09:11.219
I think the telephone system between you and God is not all right.

845
01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:14.299
Better put it right,

846
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.020
I guess too much.

847
01:09:18.509 --> 01:09:19.160
Watch me.

848
01:09:31.719 --> 01:09:32.769
Put your left to the right,

849
01:09:32.929 --> 01:09:35.328
because when we work very hard our raga catches.

850
01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:38.169
Put left to the right 7 times.

851
01:09:39.879 --> 01:09:40.959
All of you should cry.

852
01:09:50.788 --> 01:09:51.019
No

853
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:04.959
Cing what a year.

854
01:10:06.399 --> 01:10:07.339
To correct

855
01:10:09.759 --> 01:10:12.120
And one should not be angry with him,

856
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.189
I think.

857
01:10:15.259 --> 01:10:16.080
In England

858
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.259
they behave very well.

859
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:19.629
He's here to

860
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.649
because he knows a lot about Sergio,

861
01:10:21.839 --> 01:10:23.100
to teach you about Sergio.

862
01:10:24.069 --> 01:10:25.509
You must have knowledge of surgery.

863
01:10:25.959 --> 01:10:26.950
That's very important.

864
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:29.439
Because if you don't have the knowledge,

865
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:29.830
you see,

866
01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.750
the people don't feel impressed by you.

867
01:10:31.759 --> 01:10:32.830
You must know it.

868
01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.069
Left Christi left right at the mother.

869
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:43.049
Don't get to the left,

870
01:10:43.209 --> 01:10:44.279
that's your weakness.

871
01:10:48.819 --> 01:10:48.830
Ah,

872
01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:55.950
How much air on it

873
01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:57.319
nonstop.

874
01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.029
It's getting more intense,

875
01:10:59.169 --> 01:10:59.759
not less.

876
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:02.290
Left.

877
01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:03.770
Re

878
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:23.520
Little her.

879
01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:41.009
Lu.

880
01:11:41.939 --> 01:11:41.950
Right,

881
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:43.220
yeah.

882
01:12:02.859 --> 01:12:05.049
Now you see how your mother has to suffer.

883
01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:07.290
You must all keep yourself clean,

884
01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.509
practise a yoga,

885
01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.970
meditate every day,

886
01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.370
and try to meet one

887
01:12:12.899 --> 01:12:13.990
as far as possible.

888
01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:14.850
That all

889
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:16.140
creates problems.

890
01:12:19.299 --> 01:12:19.319
Get enough.

891
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:23.339
You must meet everyone,

892
01:12:23.419 --> 01:12:23.930
you see.

893
01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.009
That stopped.

894
01:12:26.529 --> 01:12:28.109
Try to meet as many as possible.

895
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.020
I stopped.

896
01:12:32.509 --> 01:12:33.959
I've got pain in your head.

897
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:35.750
I've got a headache?

898
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:38.379
I have,

899
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:40.729
huh,

900
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:43.310
it's gone up here.

901
01:12:45.129 --> 01:12:45.410
Rub it,

902
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:46.479
rub it a little bit.

903
01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.720
We face yourself,

904
01:12:53.759 --> 01:12:54.120
you see,

905
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.750
why do you develop an aria?

906
01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.209
Develop

907
01:12:57.959 --> 01:12:59.919
it because you think you're doing the work.

908
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.509
Ah,

909
01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:20.720
Wow

910
01:13:25.419 --> 01:13:26.350
Not better on the left.

911
01:13:27.089 --> 01:13:28.410
Now getting better on the left.

912
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.379
It's getting better on the left.

913
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.740
Co

914
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:38.009

Well,

Lela.

919
01:14:40.819 --> 01:14:41.450

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:43.770

924
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:51.439
You have paid off the debts of so many before.

925
01:14:51.569 --> 01:14:53.729
Now who is going to pay off our debts?

926
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:56.470
Because

927
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.979
Sri Krishna is also Kubera,

928
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.910
it's the one.

929
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:02.750
Who is the giver of wealth.

930
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:05.060

01:16:17.819 --> 01:16:18.189

Wow.

934
01:17:12.529 --> 01:17:15.250
Not to feel guilty is very wrong way attitude.

935
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.979
Face it,

936
01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:34.669
Actually I,

937
01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:37.970
I get deaf sometimes the way you people see it.

938
01:17:39.399 --> 01:17:42.270
The doctor has given me a earphone.

939
01:18:14.299 --> 01:18:14.319
A

940
01:18:18.589 --> 01:18:19.379
We should leave.

941
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:20.220
We should leave.

942
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.140
I better get my case.

943
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:30.450
Christine,

944
01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:32.720
I wanted to tell you about this,

945
01:18:32.729 --> 01:18:33.279

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.600
programme of going to India.

947
01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:36.220
I think,

948
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:37.279
but you are,

949
01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:38.500

951
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.359

952
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:43.370

953
01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.879
And uh the list has not gone of marriages,

954
01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:49.200
uh,

955
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:50.450
which must be

956
01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:52.089
sent immediately

957
01:18:53.279 --> 01:18:53.299
to go.

958
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:54.830
I wanted you to see it first.

959
01:18:57.339 --> 01:18:58.390
Wanted me to see it.

960
01:18:59.259 --> 01:19:01.810
We'll see that together there would be better.

961
01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:03.410
Have you got it now?

962
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:04.060
All right,

963
01:19:04.259 --> 01:19:04.770
in your room.

964
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.939
So I'll see that and I'll see the people.

965
01:19:07.939 --> 01:19:08.850
That's one thing.

966
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:11.180
Secondly,

967
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.990
And the circular I hope to have written

968
01:19:15.569 --> 01:19:17.589
that he shouldn't bring too many clothes there.

969
01:19:19.549 --> 01:19:21.149
Those who want to have saris,

970
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:24.390
we will get 3 saris and 3 blouses and 3 petticoats.

971
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:26.509
Ready for them

972
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:28.109
if they write it down.

973
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:30.660
Have you written down like that?

974
01:19:30.779 --> 01:19:30.910
Yes,

975
01:19:31.509 --> 01:19:31.890

976
01:19:32.089 --> 01:19:33.939

977
01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:34.959
All right,

979
01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:40.529
Anybody who hasn't given me their measurements,

I think most of you have.

981
01:19:42.399 --> 01:19:43.839
Make sure you give me it today.

982
01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:45.129

985
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:51.959
we will not be in Bombay.

986
01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:53.810
For some time.

987
01:19:56.879 --> 01:19:59.490
I think we'll never be in Bombay till you come back,

988
01:19:59.779 --> 01:20:00.649
so no question.

989
01:20:04.609 --> 01:20:05.779
Now about money,

990
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:07.029
how much have you sent?

991
01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.500
Is 180 sent

992
01:20:13.439 --> 01:20:13.490
sent all of their money.

993
01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:14.279
Everyone should have all of their money.

994
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.589
Yes,

995
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:15.069
all of it.

996
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:16.229
Everyone sent their deposit,

997
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:17.899
but most people have paid

998
01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:19.029
all of the money.

999
01:20:19.109 --> 01:20:20.660
The only thing they have to pay

1000
01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:22.160
is the airfare,

1001
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.060
and that they have to pay to Babet.

1002
01:20:24.589 --> 01:20:25.379
that's different.

1003
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:26.169
That's.

1004
01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.850
All that money should be paid.

1005
01:20:34.779 --> 01:20:35.919
Now about

1006
01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:36.850
luggage.

1007
01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:38.850
Again I say

1008
01:20:38.979 --> 01:20:40.370
don't carry too much,

1009
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:41.859
but you must carry.

1010
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.020
Some sort of a

1011
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:44.830
foam

1012
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:46.220
thing,

1013
01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:49.149
about 2 to 3 inches.

1014
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:50.509
That

1015
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:53.240
Quite light.

1016
01:20:54.209 --> 01:20:55.919
Or in your sleeping bag.

1017
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.310
That is something you have to donate

1018
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.540
to Indians.

1019
01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.689
It's very important.

1020
01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:08.459
4 thick as that rubber or 4,

1021
01:21:09.009 --> 01:21:10.040
whatever you can get.

1022
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:13.180
Rubber would be expensive.

1023
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.200
No,

1024
01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:18.240
they better buy whatever you can get.

1025
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:19.299
Then rubber is better.

1026
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.649
For Indian climate travel is better,

1027
01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.140
about 3 inches.

1028
01:21:26.839 --> 01:21:29.310
It is covered with some sort of a sheet or something I

1029
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:33.299
think 3 inches 3 inches thick might be quite a heavy one.

1030
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.509
No,

1031
01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:33.669
no,

1032
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:34.189
not heavy.

1033
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:35.080
It is not.

1034
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:38.459
They are not carrying too much luggage.

1035
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:42.709
Everybody can carry one as I meant for the buses.

1036
01:21:43.029 --> 01:21:44.200
I mean for the buses.

1037
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.990
No,

1038
01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:45.149
no,

1039
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.830
not for buses.

1040
01:21:46.479 --> 01:21:46.490
No,

1041
01:21:46.509 --> 01:21:46.750
no,

1042
01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:47.370
no problem.

1043
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:49.950
No problem for buses.

1044
01:21:50.029 --> 01:21:52.229
I can get something else like a truck or something,

1045
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.669
you know,

1046
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:54.189
but the amount I have to pay,

1047
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.399
you know,

1048
01:21:54.439 --> 01:21:57.709
what happens when you get anything from the people.

1049
01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.450
They give you these,

1050
01:21:59.459 --> 01:21:59.770
uh,

1051
01:21:59.779 --> 01:22:00.979
what do you call this

1052
01:22:01.419 --> 01:22:02.299
mattresses there.

1053
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.859
And I don't know.

1054
01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:05.399
Some people carelessly

1055
01:22:05.970 --> 01:22:06.680
use that,

1056
01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:09.399
and you have to pay for the whole price of the whole thing,

1057
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:11.520
and then it really tells upon us.

1058
01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.140
Uh sometimes 50,

1059
01:22:14.419 --> 01:22:15.770
sometimes 60 is too much.

1060
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:19.870
So it's better you bring your own

1061
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.109
once for all,

1062
01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.680
and we'll manage it

1063
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.319
because we can always use that.

1064
01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:25.660
Well,

1065
01:22:27.379 --> 01:22:27.390
man,

1066
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.229
don't you worry.

1067
01:22:28.299 --> 01:22:29.649
I don't mind paying for that.

1068
01:22:30.419 --> 01:22:31.839
But the lord and all,

1069
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:32.959
but in any case,

1070
01:22:33.009 --> 01:22:34.750
if you don't read too many things.

1071
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.839
Why don't you bring a small suitcase with a few things in it,

1072
01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:39.830
whatever you need,

1073
01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.830
because Indian soaps are better than here.

1074
01:22:41.919 --> 01:22:42.609
Indian

1075
01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:44.549
toothpastes are better than here.

1076
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.620
Everything is better than here

1077
01:22:46.839 --> 01:22:48.709
at the most the brush you might bring

1078
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.200
toothbrush.

1079
01:22:51.479 --> 01:22:53.990
A person walking out with a toothbrush is the best.

1080
01:22:56.339 --> 01:22:56.580
I mean,

1081
01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.100
combs,

1082
01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:57.700
we get better.

1083
01:22:57.819 --> 01:22:58.459
Whatever you need,

1084
01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.259
you tell us.

1085
01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.649
We get you everything soaps.

1086
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:02.509
So

1087
01:23:03.529 --> 01:23:05.160
we get beautiful soaps in India.

1088
01:23:05.169 --> 01:23:06.930
I use always Indian soaps.

1089
01:23:09.299 --> 01:23:10.819
Sandroot soaps are beautiful.

1090
01:23:10.959 --> 01:23:12.629
They're so nice for the skin and

1091
01:23:12.979 --> 01:23:15.770
so good compared to all your expensive

1092
01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:16.620
things.

1093
01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.290
Washing your hair,

1094
01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.299
don't carry your shampoos.

1095
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.859
We have there very good chica eyes and all that.

1096
01:23:22.979 --> 01:23:23.899
Use them for a change,

1097
01:23:23.939 --> 01:23:24.180
you see.

1098
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.859
They'll make your hair look better.

1099
01:23:27.109 --> 01:23:27.910
They'll grow better,

1100
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.740
you'll like it.

1101
01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.439
Anything like that you want,

1102
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.259
we can get you.

1103
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:34.609
And it's not much to pay

1104
01:23:34.899 --> 01:23:35.339
also.

1105
01:23:37.009 --> 01:23:37.819
Under clothes,

1106
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:38.819
if you want to take,

1107
01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:40.959
you can take it otherwise if you give us sizes,

1108
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:42.560
we'll get you under clothes also.

1109
01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:44.520
Pure cotton under clothes are very,

1110
01:23:44.609 --> 01:23:45.689
very cheap in India.

1111
01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.770
So don't carry too many things.

1112
01:23:48.810 --> 01:23:49.970
There's no need to carry.

1113
01:23:51.379 --> 01:23:54.259
Because whatever you get here is very uncomfortable to me

1114
01:23:54.259 --> 01:23:56.649
at least because everything is mixed with this nylon,

1115
01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.379
this that

1116
01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:58.620
you put your foot anywhere,

1117
01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.609
it's nylon,

1118
01:23:59.899 --> 01:24:00.359
do anything,

1119
01:24:00.379 --> 01:24:01.330
it is nylon,

1120
01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.330
so it's not comfortable for a surgery.

1121
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:07.549
And even your soaps are some horrible chemicals,

1122
01:24:07.569 --> 01:24:08.160
you see.

1123
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.609
I mean,

1124
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:09.879
I just cannot

1125
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.080
use some of the soaps you have like cam.

1126
01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:14.390
I don't know what goes wrong with it.

1127
01:24:15.399 --> 01:24:17.370
So many of them this then this

1128
01:24:17.899 --> 01:24:20.359
uh milkafulai or something that to

1129
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:21.790
life business I cannot.

1130
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:26.270
Just gives me rush.

1131
01:24:30.919 --> 01:24:32.919
Now what else is to be carried like that?

1132
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:37.939
Just the suit they go there with just one suit of clothes what they're wearing

1133
01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:40.939
and 2 will do 2 will do,

1134
01:24:41.029 --> 01:24:41.870
but that suits,

1135
01:24:42.049 --> 01:24:43.799
suit only 1 at the most.

1136
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:44.149
I mean,

1137
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:46.299
where will you get to the suits?

1138
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:48.259
You just wear these kurta pyjamas.

1139
01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:49.229
That's the best there.

1140
01:24:50.379 --> 01:24:53.620
Was the use of wearing a suit in that heat to get all the boils on the body?

1141
01:24:57.890 --> 01:25:00.220
Maybe a jacket or some sweater sweater,

1142
01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:01.020
sweater.

1143
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:02.359
Don't sweater.

1144
01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:04.640
Sweater is sufficient for India.

1145
01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:08.930
Don't have to carry goats and raincoats and umbrellas.

1146
01:25:09.609 --> 01:25:10.419
There's no need.

1147
01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:12.490
So,

1148
01:25:12.759 --> 01:25:15.470
they virtually need to carry virtually no luggage.

1149
01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:22.240
Virtually they'll be wearing most of it when they go when you can't wear kurtas,

1150
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:29.729
no journey from here they have virtually nothing with them just an empty

1151
01:25:29.729 --> 01:25:34.080
bag if somebody has got a kura they may like to take it,

1152
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:34.669
you see,

1153
01:25:34.959 --> 01:25:36.959
but you can buy two kurtas for yourself.

1154
01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:38.040
It's a good idea.

1155
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.600
They buy,

1156
01:25:39.759 --> 01:25:42.680
they normally buy about 4 or 545 silks because the last time we went

1157
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:42.919
there we couldn't get silk ones till the very last one we'll have to,

1158
01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:43.160
but if you give me sizes of this type of,

1159
01:25:43.169 --> 01:25:43.259
I don't know what they call them.

1160
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.310
What is that half

1161
01:26:00.919 --> 01:26:02.009
half

1162
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.970
half pyjama pyjamas.

1163
01:26:06.330 --> 01:26:07.330
They're not and they're not pyjamas.

1164
01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:08.560
They're,

1165
01:26:08.779 --> 01:26:09.680
they're half pyjamas.

1166
01:26:10.589 --> 01:26:11.140
At the

1167
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:12.950
most you can bring long johns.

1168
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.990
Yeah

1169
01:26:17.169 --> 01:26:17.390
I mean,

1170
01:26:17.419 --> 01:26:17.810
if you,

1171
01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:20.000
you won't find it so cold.

1172
01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.870
I don't know what you can bring razors,

1173
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:24.509
maybe.

1174
01:26:27.279 --> 01:26:29.040
But where do you use the electric lasers?

1175
01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:29.240
No,

1176
01:26:29.279 --> 01:26:30.319
battery operated ones,

1177
01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:32.959
you used the whole journey or a battery ones.

1178
01:26:33.069 --> 01:26:33.399
All right.

1179
01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.149
How big batteries,

1180
01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.629
the kind of battery you bought for me.

1181
01:26:38.399 --> 01:26:39.169
That's a good one.

1182
01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:40.080
Bring those kinds.

1183
01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:40.879
The battery is good.

1184
01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:41.720
That's a good idea.

1185
01:26:41.759 --> 01:26:42.200
battery.

1186
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.709
What else?

1187
01:26:42.839 --> 01:26:44.720
The batteries self-charging ones you're talking about,

1188
01:26:44.759 --> 01:26:46.029
the ones you thought were good.

1189
01:26:46.319 --> 01:26:49.279
You just plug them in and they charge up plug you won't get.

1190
01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:52.509
Better bring where you can put the batteries.

1191
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.180
Yeah,

1192
01:26:53.379 --> 01:26:56.069
we didn't we bring batteries that no,

1193
01:26:56.339 --> 01:26:56.419
no,

1194
01:26:56.459 --> 01:26:57.330
batteries

1195
01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.810
that can be plugged or battery right both ways.

1196
01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.930
One everybody must have a battery.

1197
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:04.810
It's very good.

1198
01:27:06.209 --> 01:27:07.540
What is.

1199
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.319
We'll get your oils.

1200
01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:12.529
Everything

1201
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:14.649
We'll get you oils,

1202
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:15.890
combs,

1203
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.350
huh,

1204
01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.819
chapels you'll get there

1205
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.569
tooth,

1206
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:22.890
toothbrush you must bring because I don't know.

1207
01:27:23.009 --> 01:27:25.240
Indians are not very good at toothbrushes.

1208
01:27:26.569 --> 01:27:26.899
We use,

1209
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:27.600
you see,

1210
01:27:27.799 --> 01:27:28.560
the other thing,

1211
01:27:29.649 --> 01:27:30.410
Indians thing

1212
01:27:31.209 --> 01:27:32.379
which you may not like,

1213
01:27:32.970 --> 01:27:34.620
but it's very good for the teeth.

1214
01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:42.049
Maybe toothpaste if you are fond of any one of them.

1215
01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:43.629
I

1216
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:45.299
don't know what else can you bring.

1217
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:48.169
Do they need Ashley's suitcases or soft bag,

1218
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.419
you know,

1219
01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:49.689
big soft bag.

1220
01:27:50.370 --> 01:27:50.680
Why?

1221
01:27:51.049 --> 01:27:51.600
Well,

1222
01:27:53.529 --> 01:27:55.560
in case you want to bring something back.

1223
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:56.009
No,

1224
01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:56.169
no,

1225
01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:56.879
then you see,

1226
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.560
you should buy one in India.

1227
01:27:59.529 --> 01:28:01.209
Why don't you buy one leather one there?

1228
01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:01.930
We'll order.

1229
01:28:02.009 --> 01:28:05.189
They'll give you a very nice leather soft box about.

1230
01:28:05.729 --> 01:28:06.359
Oh yes.

1231
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:08.600
Why don't you get a pure leather?

1232
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:13.759
These horrible soft ones here,

1233
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.620
they go give way in no time.

1234
01:28:16.069 --> 01:28:17.299
They'll give a nice

1235
01:28:17.569 --> 01:28:19.830
one with a lock and everything.

1236
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:25.629
Pure leather.

1237
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:27.220
How many for that?

1238
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:28.669
Raise your hands.

1239
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.220
Those who are going

1240
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:31.830
one pure leather thing,

1241
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:34.540
those who are going to be there.

1242
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:36.470
It's good.

1243
01:28:38.410 --> 01:28:38.689
Christine,

1244
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:39.560
why don't you come?

1245
01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.740
I'd love to if we could afford it,

1246
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:44.290
but

1247
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:46.089
I don't know if it'll be possible she wanted because of the house,

1248
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:50.379
because of the house purchase.

1249
01:28:50.509 --> 01:28:51.180
He's there.

1250
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:52.419
What is he going to do?

1251
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:53.430
Let him do the house.

1252
01:28:53.509 --> 01:28:55.060
What are you going to do with the house?

1253
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.500
The money,

1254
01:28:55.509 --> 01:28:56.089
the money.

1255
01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:56.819
What's the money

1256
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:02.720
we need her salary for the,

1257
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:02.950
well,

1258
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.770
not just that,

1259
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.910
no,

1260
01:29:04.029 --> 01:29:05.740
whether we'll have enough to pay for the trip.

1261
01:29:05.839 --> 01:29:06.470
It's.

1262
01:29:08.089 --> 01:29:08.430
I mean,

1263
01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:10.140
what a house you're buying like that.

1264
01:29:10.819 --> 01:29:12.169
What's the use of such a big house?

1265
01:29:12.209 --> 01:29:13.319
What are you going to do with it?

1266
01:29:14.819 --> 01:29:15.290
Well,

1267
01:29:15.459 --> 01:29:17.549
maybe some people would come and live with us.

1268
01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:20.560
Savis then it's so.

1269
01:29:21.419 --> 01:29:21.430
Um,

1270
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:23.089
they can be.

1271
01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:27.379
If those surgeries you want to stay with you can pay

1272
01:29:27.379 --> 01:29:29.839
because I think it's a long time you have not been.

1273
01:29:31.339 --> 01:29:31.370
Yes it is,

1274
01:29:31.419 --> 01:29:34.660
but people have been asking me why Christina has not come with such an old surgery,

1275
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:34.970
Winnie,

1276
01:29:34.979 --> 01:29:38.930
like you said they remember this time Pat all this old group is going,

1277
01:29:39.339 --> 01:29:40.689
so I think you should make it.

1278
01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:43.500
Yes,

1279
01:29:43.779 --> 01:29:44.620
she let her come.

1280
01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.020
Actually,

1281
01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:47.899
he also must,

1282
01:29:47.939 --> 01:29:49.540
but you can go halfway.

1283
01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:52.020
He can come halfway because Aga is terrible

1284
01:29:52.419 --> 01:29:53.890
and surgeries will get after you,

1285
01:29:53.899 --> 01:29:54.790
the Indian surgeries.

1286
01:29:54.859 --> 01:29:56.149
They'll give you a nice massage.

1287
01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.160
I can see that as soon as you come,

1288
01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.339
they'll jump on you.

1289
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:02.350
Be prepared Michaela.

1290
01:30:04.009 --> 01:30:04.689
Terrible.

1291
01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:06.169
I tell you it's numbing.

1292
01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:07.209
It's very bad.

1293
01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:07.959
Hold it.

1294
01:30:11.899 --> 01:30:12.500
It's terrible.

1295
01:30:13.259 --> 01:30:13.770
Hold it.

1296
01:30:15.549 --> 01:30:17.160
Just imagine beside you,

1297
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:18.299
beside that.

1298
01:30:19.359 --> 01:30:19.399
Better now.

1299
01:30:25.209 --> 01:30:25.279
This is steady.

1300
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000
To.

1301
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:37.379
I should get dressed.

1302
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.500
I should get dressed.

1303
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:45.229
I should get dressed.

1304
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.290
Who can do that again.

1305
01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:48.910
It's too much.

1306
01:30:50.589 --> 01:30:50.919
safe

1307
01:30:57.930 --> 01:30:59.350
I did quite a lot.

1308
01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:23.470
It seems never ending.

1309
01:31:26.919 --> 01:31:28.160
Little tiny bit of sugar,

1310
01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:28.569
mother,

1311
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.930
teeny little bit of sugar,

1312
01:31:31.479 --> 01:31:32.020
a little bit.

1313
01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:33.720
A little bit.

1314
01:31:38.919 --> 01:31:38.930
Yeah

1315
01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:42.529
That's the way

1316
01:31:46.819 --> 01:31:47.049
Man

1317
01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:48.740
the

1318
01:31:50.569 --> 01:31:51.390
Not him.

1319
01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:52.129
No,

1320
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.649
no.

1321
01:31:55.529 --> 01:31:56.520
It's such a lot.

1322
01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:04.259
I just want to do it so they all clear out.

1323
01:32:05.569 --> 01:32:06.939
So I can clear out myself,

1324
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:07.939
but what's the use?

1325
01:32:22.689 --> 01:32:24.229
Should they put their left hand to you,

1326
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:24.450
Mother,

1327
01:32:24.509 --> 01:32:25.759
right hand on the earth,

1328
01:32:26.979 --> 01:32:28.359
right hand on the earth,

1329
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:30.000
left hand to you.

1330
01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:30.649
Well,

1331
01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:31.720
this is all right.

1332
01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:33.180
See,

1333
01:32:33.379 --> 01:32:33.939
always

1334
01:32:34.259 --> 01:32:34.819
remember

1335
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.470
that positive goes to negative,

1336
01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:37.779
you see,

1337
01:32:37.899 --> 01:32:39.370
so the connection is established.

1338
01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.899
So on the left hand side,

1339
01:32:40.979 --> 01:32:41.850
if you're working,

1340
01:32:41.979 --> 01:32:43.569
then you have the right hand

1341
01:32:43.859 --> 01:32:45.259
and left hand takes it up,

1342
01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.609
put your left hand and you'll see the difference.

1343
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:52.000
Lucky.

1344
01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:56.390
Oh

1345
01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:05.879
Sucking it,

1346
01:33:05.979 --> 01:33:06.060
yeah,

1347
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:06.759
sucking.

1348
01:33:12.759 --> 01:33:12.770
See,

1349
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:14.589
nothing is happening.

1350
01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:16.819
I mean,

1351
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:17.790
I'm sucking it.

1352
01:33:17.859 --> 01:33:18.259
I'm sorry,

1353
01:33:18.339 --> 01:33:19.399
I'm sucking it.

1354
01:33:20.299 --> 01:33:20.689
No,

1355
01:33:20.859 --> 01:33:21.700
just see the other one.

1356
01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:27.209
I see.

1357
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:29.160
So they're different.

1358
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:31.959
Just,

1359
01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:33.759
just like electrical charge.

1360
01:33:37.649 --> 01:33:38.450
Same laws.

1361
01:33:40.209 --> 01:33:40.700
Salo.

1362
01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:50.569
All right,

1363
01:33:50.859 --> 01:33:51.009
OK.

1364
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.740
Still there,

1365
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.959
still there.

1366
01:33:55.169 --> 01:33:56.229
I'll do it in the car.

1367
01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.390
I hope you're better now,

1368
01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:00.209
are you?

1369
01:34:04.069 --> 01:34:07.649
I'll have to hold my ears now because I must have said something.

1370
01:34:08.609 --> 01:34:08.720
Yeah.

1371
01:34:15.419 --> 01:34:16.509
I just don't know.

1372
01:34:17.799 --> 01:34:20.640
Such a lot of catch on the left we it was terrible.

1373
01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:22.979
Too much.

1374
01:34:23.839 --> 01:34:23.959
No,

1375
01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.970
too much that you should have to pull your ears.

1376
01:34:26.279 --> 01:34:26.439
I mean,

1377
01:34:26.479 --> 01:34:28.229
it comes to that then what to do.

1378
01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.649
It's just I don't think they can handle you being angry.

1379
01:34:34.359 --> 01:34:35.910
Guilty actually don't receive anything,

1380
01:34:35.919 --> 01:34:36.629
what I'm saying.

1381
01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.520
Not to feel guilty.

1382
01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.330
What is that?

1383
01:34:40.410 --> 01:34:43.040
I'm not saying it to you because if you are the spirit,

1384
01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.120
I'm not telling it to you,

1385
01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.069
but to something else that is not you.

1386
01:34:50.279 --> 01:34:50.680
OK,

1387
01:34:50.759 --> 01:34:50.959
cool.

1388
01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:51.759
Yeah,

1389
01:34:51.799 --> 01:34:52.370
the spitting.

1390
01:34:58.649 --> 01:34:59.529
So how are you?

1391
01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.049
That's good.

1392
01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.830
And what about you?

1393
01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.839
Where are those three lost souls?

1394
01:35:07.919 --> 01:35:08.819
Lost forever.

1395
01:35:11.779 --> 01:35:12.569
Horrible there.

1396
01:35:13.359 --> 01:35:14.549
What their addresses?

1397
01:35:15.299 --> 01:35:15.339
Sam LA

1398
01:35:19.770 --> 01:35:22.000
2 from LA and one from um.

1399
01:35:23.339 --> 01:35:24.109
Monterey

1400
01:35:25.569 --> 01:35:26.720
San Francisco area.

1401
01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:29.259
See,

1402
01:35:29.299 --> 01:35:30.459
now if you go after them,

1403
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:31.990
their ego will be pampered,

1404
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.370
as it is that too much ego.

1405
01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.939
They don't mind living here as it is,

1406
01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:43.859
taking drugs,

1407
01:35:43.979 --> 01:35:45.020
doing all kinds of things.

1408
01:35:51.850 --> 01:35:54.080
Also to say this is too much is also

1409
01:35:54.370 --> 01:35:55.319
ego's expression,

1410
01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:55.600
I think,

1411
01:35:55.609 --> 01:35:56.319
isn't it?

1412
01:35:56.890 --> 01:35:58.490
Too much forego only.

1413
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.919
Oh

1414
01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:21.540
All right,

1415
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:23.310
it's good.

1416
01:36:34.479 --> 01:36:34.709
I love this.

1417
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:36.089
Still,

1418
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:38.600
the right I guess too much is impossible.

1419
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.850
Pull it out.

1420
01:36:49.819 --> 01:36:50.160
I did change.

1421
01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:51.450
God bless you.

1422
01:36:52.979 --> 01:36:57.549
This kind of a thing do you want the one that's it exactly same tight,

1423
01:36:58.009 --> 01:36:58.930
tight bottoms,

1424
01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.220
not the big baggy ones.

1425
01:37:01.069 --> 01:37:01.470
Oh

1426
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:07.180
That one is uh this char.

1427
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:12.140
Not very tight also.

1428
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.660
Yes,

1429
01:37:13.069 --> 01:37:15.189
there are some which were very tight and they were no good.

1430
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:16.930
They split every time you sat down,

1431
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:19.700
and there's another type which is too baggy.

1432
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:21.339
They don't look nice.

1433
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:23.020
You look like you're,

1434
01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:23.270
yes,

1435
01:37:23.410 --> 01:37:24.580
they look like you're going to bed.

1436
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:25.720
You don't look like you're doing Puja.

1437
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:29.779
And the other type is this type is very smart and it's nice.

1438
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:35.319
You have to look elegant.

1439
01:37:36.049 --> 01:37:36.620
For you,

1440
01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:37.259
I don't know this

1441
01:37:40.479 --> 01:37:40.509
this one too.

1442
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.399
Nobody who is

1443
01:37:44.509 --> 01:37:46.169
younger than 12 years is coming,

1444
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.990
isn't it?

1445
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.459
That's right.

1446
01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:48.850
Jacqueline

1447
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.649
Jacqueline

1448
01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.470
Jacqueline is what is her age?

1449
01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:57.509
But she's quite mature for her age.

1450
01:37:57.799 --> 01:37:58.629
Jacqueline is quite.

1451
01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.410
Your daughter is uh quite sensible right now she's all right.

1452
01:38:04.759 --> 01:38:05.609
She's a lot better.

1453
01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.129
She's very sensible for her.

1454
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:12.479
Yes,

1455
01:38:12.529 --> 01:38:14.069
up to that we can have,

1456
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:15.040
say 10 years,

1457
01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.029
we should put about 10 years.

1458
01:38:18.899 --> 01:38:20.790
Very small children going to be difficult.

1459
01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:27.509
Better.

1460
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:30.430
All right.

1461
01:38:31.899 --> 01:38:32.479
I'll see,

1462
01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.709
I'll be seeing this lawyer with a muddled head.

1463
01:38:36.799 --> 01:38:39.029
He liked me because I'm quite confused.

1464
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:43.500
He'd be totally confused by the time you're French.

1465
01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.120
All right.

1466
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:47.549
May God bless you.

1467
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:48.390
Enjoy yourself now.

1468
01:38:48.529 --> 01:38:48.850
Enjoy.

1469
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:50.379
I don't talk too much.

1470
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:51.430
Don't talk too much.

1471
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:52.459
That's not necessary.

1472
01:38:52.549 --> 01:38:53.350
Just enjoy

1473
01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:54.189
a little bit.

1474
01:38:54.509 --> 01:38:56.069
Talk something nice to each other.

1475
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.709
Be nice,

1476
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:57.339
kind,

1477
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:58.339
but all the time,

1478
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.509
talk,

1479
01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:58.709
talk,

1480
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.950
talk,

1481
01:38:59.029 --> 01:38:59.149
talk,

1482
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.390
you know,

1483
01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:00.379
one goes mad.

1484
01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:03.189
They have some

1485
01:39:06.819 --> 01:39:06.859
tapes,

1486
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.990
listen to tapes.

1487
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:07.790
That's better is better.

1488
01:39:08.049 --> 01:39:09.399
A sing is better than talking,

1489
01:39:09.439 --> 01:39:10.109
I think.

1490
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:14.620
Hello Sri Mahakali matajiri and Mala Devi.

1491
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.379

Yeah,

1532
01:47:11.729 --> 01:47:12.609
