1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:04,808
Today we have decided

2
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:09,801
to have a puja of Virata

3
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,067
in the land of Shri Krishna.

4
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,667
As you know, in the growth

5
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:23,641
of Shri Vishnu's manifestation,

6
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:28,901
He comes into ten incarnations

7
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:35,968
and ultimately He manifests Himself as Virat.

8
00:00:36,501 --> 00:55:17,280
Virat is the brain of the being

9
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:53,534
which can call as God Almighty,

10
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,708
so the whole central nervous system is worked through

11
00:00:57,868 --> 00:01:06,234
by Shri Krishna as Vishnu,

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,474
then all this incarnations,

13
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:15,267
then Shri Krishna and ultimately as Virat.

14
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:19,968
This is the development of our brain

15
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:24,374
and when we are worshipping Virat,

16
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:29,808
we have to know that within us also we have got

17
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:35,708
the manifestation of this power of Virat.

18
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:39,641
That manifestation which we have

19
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:47,801
we can call it as Virat if Shri Krishna is Mahavirata.

20
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:50,107
You all know about Virat

21
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:53,873
much more than I can tell you today

22
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:58,701
because It's the whole,

23
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:02,200
It's the totality.

24
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:10,607
And the totality of everything, if that is Virat,

25
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:13,907
then that is in your brain,

26
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:19,167
but reality is in your heart.

27
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:24,274
So the totality you may see,

28
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:26,674
you may witness,

29
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:32,274
the reality is the subtlety behind it.

30
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:35,574
So the brain which is not ruled by the heart,

31
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,240
which is not nourished by the heart,

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,774
is a very dangerous thing,

33
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:44,207
because it creates extroversion,

34
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:49,973
and such a person who is without any heart

35
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:55,741
tries to do things, becomes very ruthless

36
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:58,240
and can be very dangerous.

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,634
It could the other way also within us;

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,574
that if we allow our heart to rule us,

39
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:08,873
only live with our emotions

40
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,240
and not to use our rationality,

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,007
then we can become really very dangerous people to ourselves.

42
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:20,341
In the sense, we become lethargic,

43
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:25,774
we become indulgent into wrong sort of things.

44
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:29,567
And today what one feels that in America

45
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,040
there's more dominance

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,767
of the left side than of the right.

47
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,940
Right side is our attention

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,808
and the right side of attention is we can say

49
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:46,973
is the liver of God Almighty.

50
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,541
So now when we have to talk of the totality,

51
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:52,240
when we are part and parcel of the totality

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,441
and now we are awakened to that existence of ours

53
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:00,808
as the part and parcel of the whole,

54
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:03,174
then we have to realize to become the whole

55
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,674
we have to do something about it.

56
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,407
Specially in the land of Shri Krishna

57
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,607
we have to work out this tremendous task

58
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:16,200
of creating Viratas out of Sahaja Yogis.

59
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:21,873
After going through the various experiences

60
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:25,140
of American Sahaja Yoga,

61
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,808
I've reached a conclusion

62
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:30,507
that we have to talk more frankly about things

63
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,774
than we have been talking before.

64
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:37,441
Why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country

65
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:41,968
while there are so many seekers.

66
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:48,507
The main point is that we do not realize

67
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:55,167
that the left side is overpowering this country very much.

68
00:04:55,767 --> 00:05:01,067
There are people who are active,

69
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:07,641
but the percentage is very low

70
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:10,207
because of too much of affluence,

71
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,641
too much of freedom,

72
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:17,607
the idea of "what's wrong in anything."

73
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:22,040
People are going towards shamelessness,

74
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,474
immoral life, self-indulgent.

75
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:31,674
And this self-indulgence, to protect that,

76
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:35,808
people always develop a kind of a ego

77
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:40,868
which has no dynamism in it.

78
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,107
So now the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis,

79
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,274
not with Sahaja Yoga as such.

80
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:53,007
When you see that the land is not so fertile

81
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,808
and here you have to work very hard,

82
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,140
the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America

83
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,374
is to go deep.

84
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:06,541
You can see wherever the land is not fertile

85
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,474
the trees go very deep down,

86
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:16,274
they dig very deep into the Mother Earth

87
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,940
for the sap to be sucked in.

88
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,741
And the same way they grow very high,

89
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:29,968
because the strength of their deepening

90
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,374
gives them this great height.

91
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,474
So they grow very tall

92
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,641
and also they are very deep.

93
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,907
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America

94
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,474
have to work out

95
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,307
because here it's so much superficiality

96
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,741
and so much of frivolousness

97
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:51,107
and also no meaning to their lives.

98
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,107
They have no meanings at all

99
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:57,007
and they are just frittering away their lives

100
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,808
with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions

101
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,507
and their love and all those things.

102
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:06,607
So what we need today are Sahaja Yogis who are right-sided,

103
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,940
those who will produce results,

104
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,808
those who will be dynamic.

105
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:15,374
They don't have to worry that somebody is right-sided

106
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,040
and he'll become right-sided,

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,341
actually that is what is needed today.

108
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:22,741
Unless and until you have people who are dynamic

109
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,907
we cannot work it out.

110
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,934
It's a reaction in this country as well as in England,

111
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,808
in many countries who dominated other people.

112
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:33,574
Like you see in this place

113
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:36,574
which was actually originally belonged

114
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:43,307
to some tribes of Indians

115
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:47,708
and the English, the Spanish and all these Europeans came,

116
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,708
killed them and occupied here.

117
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:50,973
It's a highway robbery,

118
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,873
absolutely highway robbery.

119
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:59,240
Because of their arrogance and their aggressiveness,

120
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,274
they could not see that they were doing such a horrible thing.

121
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:05,507
I mean, why call any names of Hitler,

122
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,708
they're even worse than Hitler,

123
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,240
because at least Hitler was taken to task,

124
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,774
he was condemned and people know that it was a mistake.

125
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,708
But what about those who came all the way from there

126
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:19,374
and killed so many people here

127
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:23,341
and nicely having a very nice time everywhere

128
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:24,708
as great Americans

129
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:28,868
and now they are trying to show off everywhere.

130
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,507
Actually it's such a sinful thing that is done

131
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,774
that all these souls which have died

132
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,774
I think have possessed them

133
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:41,334
and now today America is on the left hand side.

134
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:46,407
The right hand side of Americans is finished now,

135
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,641
they are on the left hand side, guilty,

136
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,641
feeling guilty they are taking to indulgences.

137
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,708
Once you go to the right side, you see,

138
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,374
you are very disciplined

139
00:08:56,534 --> 00:09:01,341
and you become very ascetic by temperament,

140
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:06,240
I should say, and you want to dominate others

141
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,040
and you want to capture.

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,107
But today the situation of England and America is just the same.

143
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,708
In England the same thing I find with Sahaja Yogis

144
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:17,973
they are just lovey-dovey types, you see,

145
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:23,708
and all they love Me and love Me and love Me.

146
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:26,474
And I just don't understand.

147
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,708
What's this going on?

148
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,307
They all love Me

149
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:31,708
and they'll bring flowers for Me, finished.

150
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:34,274
Is this the way we are going to work our Sahaja Yoga

151
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:37,741
in that England and in this America?

152
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:42,501
"Mother, I love you very much." So what?

153
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:49,674
So to become one part and parcel of the whole,

154
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,541
a drop has to become the ocean,

155
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:55,107
you have to become great people,

156
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:58,374
you have to be responsible.

157
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:01,140
And this lovey-dovey business that you have

158
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,641
has to go out of your mind completely,

159
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:07,074
otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries

160
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:11,868
and you'll be cursed one after another.

161
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,240
There are shocks after shocks

162
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,907
that are coming to this country as well as to England.

163
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:22,140
But people are not learning any lessons from that,

164
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,641
still it is all right;

165
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:27,107
we get this disease, all right;

166
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:28,840
then we glorify it.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,200
If we are suffering from ecological difference,

168
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,708
still we are glorified.

169
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,674
If you are using too much of machinery out of balance,

170
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,240
still we are glorified.

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,574
Because they just want self-indulgence.

172
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:46,601
Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point

173
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:50,341
that what is going wrong with this country is that,

174
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:55,701
that they do not see anything that is reality.

175
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:58,574
And the reality, though it is in the heart,

176
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:03,901
though it works in the heart, it has to act.

177
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,341
This has to act and if it does not act,

178
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,741
this kind of a passive behavior

179
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,374
is not going to help you.

180
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,174
Now at this old age of Mine

181
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:18,973
I'm traveling from places to places

182
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,808
and I'm doing so much.

183
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:26,067
Now let us think about it: what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

184
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:30,541
Those who see you,

185
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:35,973
see you as sometimes as just some hippies with disheveled hairs

186
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,641
and something that kind of a thing.

187
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,441
This is the report I have,

188
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:43,140
from people who came to your centers and things like that.

189
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,207
"Oh, they are a set of hippies, you see," just like that.

190
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,541
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do,

191
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:51,107
has to make up something of his personality,

192
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:54,901
in America is very important.

193
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:57,934
They are studying, they are out of job,

194
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,808
they are doing this, that.

195
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:03,307
That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all,

196
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,374
they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

197
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:09,374
If you really want to do something you have to become something.

198
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:11,474
You have to study, you have to become something,

199
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:15,741
you have to have some sort of a degree, diploma, something

200
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,541
attached to you, you have to mean something.

201
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,873
Hippies cannot run Sahaja Yoga in America;

202
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:29,307
they may run better in India but not here.

203
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,741
So one has to realize that

204
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,973
what has gone wrong with us is that

205
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:38,207
we are now following a very subtle way

206
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:43,541
of the same trends that we have taken.

207
00:12:43,701 --> 00:13:02,708
After Realization, we think that we are realized souls,

208
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,840
that we have become yogis now,

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,634
that we are realized souls.

210
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:12,267
But one should see

211
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:15,541
that we have become realized souls, no doubt,

212
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:20,873
but whatever bindings we had before coming to Sahaja Yoga

213
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:25,100
have become subtler.

214
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:35,407
They have not expressed themselves as lights,

215
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:40,234
just we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis.

216
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:44,701
We believe that we have vibrations

217
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:48,474
and also we can feel the vibrations.

218
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:52,040
But still we have not reached that state

219
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,367
where we have become the totality.

220
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:00,441
We have to still grow.

221
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:03,708
And if you are settled down with your vibrations

222
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,907
and thinking that you are all right,

223
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,774
you are sadly mistaken.

224
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:13,140
Whatever were our conditionings before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

225
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,907
say you were a hippie,

226
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,873
so the enlightenment has come,

227
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:24,868
but then the idea of this love business is there.

228
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:27,607
Supposing you were a business man,

229
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,107
so the enlightenment has come to you

230
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:33,907
and you think that Mother should help you in your business,

231
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,174
that's what it is.

232
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,774
Supposing now if you were unmarried

233
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:40,574
and you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

234
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:43,374
then you want that your marriage should be successful

235
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,534
in Sahaja Yoga.

236
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:52,873
If there has been a problem in your health or something like that,

237
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:56,240
then you have become a subtler person that you think,

238
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,534
"I asked help from Mother for that."

239
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:07,200
But we do not think that what have we contributed to Sahaja Yoga.

240
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,868
We had certain things

241
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:18,240
which we thought were wrong - maybe that,

242
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,940
but in Sahaja Yoga we do not see those things are with us,

243
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,374
still continuing with us.

244
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:28,840
To become Virata we have to really examine ourselves,

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,407
without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.

246
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:37,107
I know people who are small-minded,

247
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:42,107
who have jealousies and their jealousies continue.

248
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:45,474
Supposing there's a good musician,

249
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:49,968
they'll not appreciate if the other person is a musician,

250
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,507
he will not appreciate,

251
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,441
he will not encourage that person that,

252
00:15:55,601 --> 00:16:01,400
"Really I am a musician, he's also a musician, let me help him."

253
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:06,574
So the small-mindedness that existed before

254
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:10,040
still becomes in a glorified way.

255
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,708
The person will think that

256
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:15,040
"All right, I am a musician and I sing very well

257
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,708
and I am singing Mother's praise."

258
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:21,801
But anybody else who's singing

259
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:24,441
will not be appreciated

260
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:27,240
to that extent as you should expect

261
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,334
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

262
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,840
This hand, if it feels hurt,

263
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,167
the another hand immediately helps it.

264
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:51,140
In the whole body you see the system is so totally connected.

265
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,300
As soon as you eat food, the digestive system starts working.

266
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,574
But we should watch ourselves.

267
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,040
If you have to become deeper,

268
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,907
we have to watch ourselves where are we lacking.

269
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:05,708
Now how does a tree grow?

270
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:07,074
I have told you many times the story

271
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,207
that there's a little cell at the end of the root

272
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,274
and it knows,

273
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:16,400
and it knows one purpose: that it has to become a tree,

274
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:17,808
so it goes round.

275
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:21,407
It sees a boulder or something, stone, goes round it,

276
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,940
doesn't fight it.

277
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,240
Because ultimately what we have to achieve

278
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,934
is to become the tree,

279
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,033
so we have to keep that in view,

280
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:35,901
that we have to become the tree

281
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:39,840
and not some sort of a small little frog here and there

282
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,341
croaking about Sahaja Yoga.

283
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:45,801
No, that's not going to work out!

284
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,741
And this is what I find

285
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:55,007
also very true about people in, say, England, same thing.

286
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,240
The leaders are fighting,

287
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,307
the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods

288
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:02,107
how to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis,

289
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,641
but it's the Sahaja Yogis

290
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:06,507
who have to know that the responsibility is theirs.

291
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:13,074
They have to grow, they have to become Viratas.

292
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,708
And this is America

293
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,774
where I told you is the place of Shri Krishna,

294
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:21,801
where Shri Krishna became the Virat.

295
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:28,973
Unless and until you see for yourself

296
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:34,307
that we have to do this, we have to become this,

297
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:38,968
you are still busy with our little, little silly problems.

298
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,607
It's a vicious circle,

299
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,973
as soon as you start worrying about your silly problems

300
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:49,174
and your old stuffs still becoming glorified in Sahaja Yoga,

301
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:55,167
then you find the vicious circle starts working,

302
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,574
it doesn't achieve anything,

303
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:02,174
it doesn't give you good chances,

304
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:06,407
it doesn't give you confidence.

305
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:11,601
It's such a thing, it's like a packaging as they call it.

306
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:16,274
But as soon as you decide, "No, I am going to do it,"

307
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:18,307
you people are Sahaja Yogis,

308
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,507
you know all about Kundalini,

309
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,940
you know all about awakening,

310
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,341
you know all about higher stages of attainment,

311
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:34,774
you all, everyone is capable of giving Realization to people.

312
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:38,040
You know where the thing is stuck,

313
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,007
everything you know, but now just think about it,

314
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:52,240
how many of you have been able to do something about it?

315
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,074
When people see you their idea about you is very poor.

316
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:02,873
They think that you are stuck up with your wives,

317
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,407
so the wife is very dominating,

318
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,507
so this is happening.

319
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,907
Suddenly you go off,

320
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:12,341
you see your child, worried about this one, you ...

321
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:16,574
Sometimes I am surprised that once they are married,

322
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:17,808
they have a child,

323
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:22,040
then they become nothing but the parents of the child, finished,

324
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,240
Sahaja Yoga is finished.

325
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,868
Then the child becomes important.

326
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:31,934
The blessings become the bindings.

327
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:38,040
So you have to watch within yourself

328
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,367
that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.

329
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,240
But in the subtle way

330
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,040
all these things go on binding

331
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,973
you and you are attached to it

332
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:52,940
and you don't know how they are still tagging you down,

333
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,708
don't allow you to fly,

334
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:56,207
they don't give you the freedom

335
00:20:56,367 --> 00:21:01,033
that is your own right to have it.

336
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,808
So even if I make a aeroplane,

337
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:06,407
I do everything, put the fuel into it,

338
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:11,973
I say everything, but doesn't want to fly.

339
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,074
Now what do you do with such an aeroplane

340
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:17,033
which doesn't want to fly?

341
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,808
This sort of a situation is there

342
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:24,274
and this situation makes you so limited

343
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:28,973
and so dwarfy. How will you grow?

344
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:33,374
Unless and until you grow and you show that

345
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,040
in your day to day life

346
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,708
into your personality, into everything,

347
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:41,074
I assure you nobody is going to be impressed by you.

348
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:46,474
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement,

349
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:48,574
nor by My photographs,

350
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:53,174
it's going to work by your work, by your responsibility,

351
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,541
by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga,

352
00:21:55,701 --> 00:22:00,507
it's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it.

353
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:04,007
But first of all your shoulders should be strong.

354
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,274
You are still out of job,

355
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:09,940
you are still something, somebody hanging in the air,

356
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,708
you are still somebody who'll not even look at you.

357
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:18,300
Then how can you carry on your shoulders?

358
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:24,674
So first thing is to build yourself inside

359
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,641
as well as outside,

360
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,507
but such a vicious circle I tell you.

361
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,708
If you do not go deep into yourself,

362
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:33,441
you cannot also get the outside thing,

363
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:35,274
so it works hand in hand,

364
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,808
as soon as you start building yourself inside,

365
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:41,074
you'll be amazed how things will work out,

366
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,441
how you'll become dynamic, how you'll become great.

367
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:46,374
But you get involved into things

368
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:50,207
which are very small and transitory.

369
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:54,341
So as I told you before, we are seeking the eternal.

370
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:57,307
So the transitory things are to be only used

371
00:22:57,467 --> 00:23:01,834
very temporarily, what we need is not so important.

372
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:06,207
If you can understand this thing clearly,

373
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:12,307
that we still are not free, not detached

374
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:18,140
from all the things we had before Sahaja Yoga

375
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,040
and they have become subtler and subtler and subtler.

376
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,307
We are still only using Sahaja Yoga for that purpose

377
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:30,734
and not for spreading the light.

378
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:38,601
So what's going to happen?

379
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,334
This is absolutely,

380
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:50,973
absolutely to be really to be understood within yourself.

381
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:55,174
Sometimes My lectures, you see, are little harsh,

382
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:59,274
people think that Mother had to say these things,

383
00:23:59,434 --> 00:24:02,441
this is also out of My love for you

384
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:06,367
and out of My love for this country.

385
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,873
You have to really see to yourself,

386
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:18,968
"What are we? Where are we?"

387
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:26,074
We are not going to end up because Sahaja Yogis we had

388
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:34,567
were subnormal people in the society.

389
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,907
If you see the gurus how they spread themselves,

390
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,240
though they are false, they are useless

391
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,107
but everybody knows about somebody who comes up. In two months time

392
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:47,607
all over the world you can hear about that person.

393
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:48,741
What they do,

394
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:52,607
they go and first of all see the people who are successful,

395
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:55,240
who are prominent in the city.

396
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,808
They never bother about people who are drug addicts,

397
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:01,641
or who are suffering from diseases, no nothing doing,

398
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:05,107
they have no business with them.

399
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:07,574
They'll just attack the people

400
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:11,634
who are very successful, who are very rich,

401
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:15,074
because they are on top of the society,

402
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:17,441
so they'll go and meet people

403
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,240
and make contacts with them and ask them and this and that

404
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,873
and then they call them for the program,

405
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,708
give them all the importance, everything,

406
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,040
then people start thinking,

407
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,541
"Oh God! What a great thing it is to be here."

408
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:33,507
Then pamper their ego a little bit, this and that's how they spread.

409
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,574
But there's no reality in it, there's nothing,

410
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:37,808
nothing special about it,

411
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:41,267
it's all useless, it's all artificial.

412
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:43,907
But that is how they sell themselves.

413
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,708
Though we do not want to sell ourselves,

414
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,507
we have to know that

415
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:52,501
unless and until we have some remarkable qualities,

416
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,708
people are not going to look at us,

417
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:57,574
because whatever has happened is within ourselves,

418
00:25:57,734 --> 00:25:59,940
and nobody sees the light,

419
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,934
it's like a light which is burning, which is covered completely.

420
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:09,240
So I've seen that

421
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,741
I went to Columbia. In Columbia, you'll be amazed

422
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:15,007
that people had never known Me,

423
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,641
they had never heard My name,

424
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,407
but I don't know why but

425
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:24,407
the crowds were so much that I couldn't enter into the compound

426
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,574
and with somehow or other I was pushed into it.

427
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:30,040
Then in the hall was impossible,

428
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,907
people were hanging on the –

429
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:34,708
I thought they were hanging

430
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,607
from the top, just sitting on the thing to watch Me over.

431
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:40,040
So many people in every direction, in every height

432
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,174
I found people there, I did not know how to settle them down.

433
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,940
But they listened to Me very carefully this thing,

434
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,240
two days we had the programmed, two days the crowds were there.

435
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,441
And then when they had to follow-on they came,

436
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,907
next day they disappeared.

437
00:26:57,067 --> 00:27:01,267
Same thing in Greece,

438
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:09,274
same thing in Turkey.

439
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:11,207
So there's definitely something wrong with us.

440
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,040
Now there's a course coming up,

441
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,240
people are trying to do the course business,

442
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,207
but one should know it is not knowledge without love,

443
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:22,007
it is love and knowledge.

444
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,074
So how you talk to them,

445
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:28,467
how you deal with them is there,

446
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,307
but your dynamism is going to impress them.

447
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,274
You can see the film we saw yesterday

448
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:37,834
in which the music was there. Now what was it?

449
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,107
There the energy was dynamic,

450
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:42,374
the energy was dynamic, with the music and everything

451
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:45,107
and that was showing.

452
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:48,307
So you see you got engrossed into it,

453
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,667
so the movement of that energy, the dynamism of that energy

454
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:56,940
really got you engrossed.

455
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:04,467
But to be afraid that you'll become right-sided is nonsensical,

456
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:12,868
now you are in the center, how can you become right-sided?

457
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:16,140
This kind of argument is only to support lethargy,

458
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,140
then not to have any discipline.

459
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,040
I was surprised that in Shudy Camp,

460
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,907
where we have established a school for meditation,

461
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:30,274
people come every week-end just to spend the week-end,

462
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:31,774
they get up at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

463
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:35,200
whenever they feel like,

464
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:39,708
they are on holidays in Shudy Camp.

465
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:40,973
And two days they'll stay there without any meditation,

466
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,074
without anything.

467
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:46,734
We have come to Mother's house, finished.

468
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:51,474
Mother has to do all the job for them.

469
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,341
I mean, for a Sahaja Yogi it is minimum of minimum

470
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,873
that they should get up early in the morning,

471
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,901
have their bath and sit down for pujas.

472
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,167
Is a common thing, all Indians do that way,

473
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:04,441
It's a practice.

474
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:08,107
Suddenly this country

475
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,207
or these countries have gone into a kind of a lethargic

476
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:12,968
nonsensical life,

477
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:20,374
otherwise this country also used to do the same thing.

478
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:25,808
And sleeping also: you have to sleep early if you want to,

479
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:28,840
but one has to think that we have to change our lifestyle,

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,074
we have to change our attitudes,

481
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,708
so many things, see, like I said simple things, like I said,

482
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:39,140
"The day you want to wash your hair,

483
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,474
put lot of oil in your hair and then wash. We'll become bald."

484
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:45,067
Imagine all bald Sahaja Yogis walking.

485
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:50,968
They'll think your Mother has so many hair and what about your hair.

486
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:57,140
In food also, too much, like

487
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,207
I don't know here what is the situation, but in England I find

488
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,674
they take so much of tea,

489
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,801
all the time the tea is - the kettle is on the thing.

490
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:09,407
I mean people are amazed

491
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:12,973
when they, people come to Ganapatipule also in India,

492
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:15,541
we don't take tea so many times,

493
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:17,774
I mean twice at the most.

494
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:19,641
The whole day people want tea there,

495
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:20,973
they don't understand

496
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:25,267
how can they go on drinking tea at one o'clock in the night.

497
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:32,901
It's like the alcohol has become subtler: tea ,

498
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:40,674
otherwise how do you explain?

499
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:43,541
You can't take alcohol, so let's have tea,

500
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:46,873
then settle down nicely, we are having cup-o-tea,

501
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,641
in England very common:

502
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:52,240
sit down nicely, cup-o-tea.

503
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,708
What work have you done that you are settling down like that?

504
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:02,634
Then whenever they'll come, "Haaa,"

505
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,973
as if they have dug up something,

506
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:10,074
or they have done the English Channel,

507
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:12,708
they'll come, even on the television you'll see people,

508
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:16,307
they come down, "Haa."

509
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,207
I don't understand.

510
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:21,307
You'll never find any Indian doing that,

511
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:24,474
after all in that heat also, he'll never say that,

512
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,907
because you think, think, think too much, just think,

513
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:31,267
don't do anything about it.

514
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:34,907
Like you file, you see, make a file,

515
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,708
tomorrow is Mother's puja, all right,

516
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:38,774
we'll have this, this, this - filed it.

517
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:43,701
At the puja it is not there, why? It's in the file.

518
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:55,567
And anything that is before your Realization,

519
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,840
like people have an idea,

520
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,374
like this how to avoid work, you see, labor saving.

521
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:05,774
Labor saving is a very great asset of the Western people.

522
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:07,474
So the labor saving how they will do.

523
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,474
Supposing, you say, "Please, telephone to such a person."

524
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:12,174
"Mother, I think he may not be there."

525
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,934
"Baba, you telephone and find out."

526
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,240
So the explanation comes from the brain,

527
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,307
it may not. So nothing can be achieved.

528
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:26,708
So first the labor saving was that

529
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:31,074
"Oh, this is anti-culture, we should be –

530
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:33,334
this is so bad, everything is so bad,

531
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,074
we should start a very natural life,

532
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:39,040
we should lead a very natural thing and that

533
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,801
we should become primitive," and all that.

534
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:48,808
From that if you grow in - from that area if you grow into Sahaja Yoga,

535
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,801
you become subtler.

536
00:32:52,968 --> 00:32:56,207
So the subtler things that they become is this way:

537
00:32:56,367 --> 00:33:00,734
that now as it is, you see,

538
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:06,407
"We should not do too much of everything, is too much, you see,

539
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,834
it is too much."

540
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,474
If you talk to somebody about Sahaja Yoga, they say,

541
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:14,634
"It's too much for me."

542
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:17,040
Hey, you have no brain or what is it?

543
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,708
What is too much? Can't take it?

544
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,907
"Oh it's too much."

545
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,474
It's a very common experience with Me,

546
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:30,107
that when I talk to people they would say, "It's too much."

547
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,474
I mean your brain, is it a limited brain

548
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:38,934
or what is it that you can't listen to Me what I am trying to tell you?

549
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,541
And once you start developing this kind of attitude,

550
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,407
the nourishment cannot reach you,

551
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:48,973
supposing the trees say, "Oh it's too much,"

552
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:52,934
then what are they going to do?

553
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,474
Nothing is too much.

554
00:33:57,634 --> 00:34:00,474
"I have to grow, I have to take all the nourishment,

555
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:03,641
I have to become something,

556
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,708
I have to do such a lot.

557
00:34:06,868 --> 00:34:08,973
What have I done?"

558
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:12,434
Nothing so far. Never be satisfied with yourself.

559
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:16,341
I mean, some people who saw My program

560
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:19,274
they were all shocked how Mother is going to do it.

561
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:24,934
I said, "I know I am going to do it, if I have to do it, I'll do it."

562
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,207
So this is what should be attitude:

563
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:37,534
when you love Me I am your ideal. You must know that.

564
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:43,541
If you love Me, then what are you doing about it?

565
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:46,300
I am your ideal. You have to reach My style,

566
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:54,601
otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out in these countries

567
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:02,541
which have taken to lethargy as a great culture.

568
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:07,968
I asked somebody, "What about your bathing,

569
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:11,840
why didn't you take bath?"

570
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,307
He said, "These days it is out of fashion to take bath."

571
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:17,901
Everything seems to be out of fashion, whatever is in fashion is horrid.

572
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:24,033
"It's very fashionable," is another thing people say,

573
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:27,174
"it's very fashionable,"

574
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,907
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

575
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:33,801
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

576
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,040
you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life.

577
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,107
We have to have education, we have to have a place,

578
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,474
we have to have a position in the society.

579
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:48,367
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

580
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,708
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there

581
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:55,708
and just doing our Tapasya.

582
00:35:55,868 --> 00:36:01,474
Tapasya is here where you live.

583
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:07,901
Otherwise if you say that "All right we have to go to Himalayas

584
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,441
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

585
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:17,341
Oh, that's very good."

586
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,040
Because that looks like something, you see,

587
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,374
you might have a name, or something like that.

588
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:24,441
But Tapasya is here,

589
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,534
the detachment has to be worked out here.

590
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:29,133
You get involved into all these things,

591
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,240
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

592
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,074
the amount of involvement you have

593
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,374
in the things which existed in gross form,

594
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:45,374
they have become subtler and you are still bound by them,

595
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:48,973
there's no freedom.

596
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:52,334
And that's why when you see something absurd happening,

597
00:36:57,434 --> 00:37:00,808
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

598
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,574
it's just the symptom of that thing becoming subtler

599
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:07,501
within us and its expressing itself.

600
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:11,667
Like sometimes you may not see fire

601
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,708
but it exists and suddenly you find a blast.

602
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:21,534
So transformation of course means evolution,

603
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,940
it also means that whatever basis you had,

604
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,708
you have to evolve out of it.

605
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:32,607
Like a flower blossoming and then becoming the fruit,

606
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:41,574
but it has to drop out many things.

607
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:46,100
And then with the nature one has to see such a unison.

608
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:54,934
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

609
00:37:56,734 --> 00:38:03,040
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

610
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,507
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

611
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:17,808
because the leaves drop out.

612
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:20,240
In the winter time they nourish the tree with their nitrogen;

613
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,341
when the time is ready,

614
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,808
then these clouds pour down and again nourish this.

615
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:36,708
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

616
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:42,240
If it was not, I tell you they would, we would, have said,

617
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,374
"all bald headed lands here."

618
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:51,133
If you go to any, any forest, any forest, it's so clean,

619
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,040
you never have any bad smell anywhere whatsoever.

620
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,441
There are animals, there are tigers, that, this –

621
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,708
never get any smell anywhere,

622
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:07,274
you never even get the smell of a tiger.

623
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:09,307
But if you put the tiger in a cage then he starts smelling,

624
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:14,574
he's so much bathed in the nature, he lives with the nature,

625
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:18,240
and in such balance.

626
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,107
It's such an understanding among all the animals, everything.

627
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:25,574
I don't know how they keep it so clean,

628
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:29,574
but as soon as you get some smell,

629
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,307
you will find out there must be some human being somewhere,

630
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:38,801
or some untidiness.

631
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:43,868
It's so organized how the leaves grow according to the sun's rays,

632
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:49,374
how they organize themselves,

633
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:51,307
how they build up themselves.

634
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:55,674
So if you really have to get to the nature of Sahaja Yoga,

635
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:59,541
we should get all these blessings

636
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:04,240
by which we should prosper.

637
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,107
Not, I mean in money and things, but in every way.

638
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:14,100
So it should not be a set of people who are just sort of parasites.

639
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,834
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today

640
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:29,341
and I request you, all of you,

641
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:33,007
to be alert and dynamic

642
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,940
and work it out.

643
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,607
Each single person has to come up.

644
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,240
It's not going to work out if you wear some saffron clothes

645
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,774
and go on singing "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" on the street.

646
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:46,708
No. It's not going to work out.

647
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:50,868
Nor it is going to work out if you say,

648
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:55,307
"We are Sahaja Yogis, we are such people and this and that."

649
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,774
Nothing. You have to be something.

650
00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:03,601
So on one side, the dynamism is to be used for yourself

651
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:08,074
and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.

652
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:12,934
You need not now worry about right-sidedness.

653
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:18,667
Is very common even in ...

654
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:21,641
This happened: I found in Holland

655
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:24,507
that I married one girl, very dynamic girl, to someone

656
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:29,674
and the husband said, "Mother, she doesn't help me."

657
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,174
I said, "Why?"

658
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:34,541
"Because I'm afraid I'll become right-sided."

659
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,574
I said, "But why did I marry you to this left-sided fellow?

660
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:42,040
That you become left-sided?"

661
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,474
Left-sided is a very good thing

662
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,474
because you don't have to do anything, just you have to say,

663
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:49,240
"I don't want to become right-sided," that's all.

664
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,100
But right-sidedness means you have to look,

665
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,973
you have to be alert, you have to be clever

666
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:04,407
and you have to know everything.

667
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:08,701
You'll sit in the sun, burn your skins,

668
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:12,973
but look at the sun.

669
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,808
Are you on the sun line or on the moon line?

670
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:19,434
So the swing of all the Western people is on the left hand side.

671
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:28,300
Drinking, pubs, like in 24 hours they sleep,

672
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:38,074
say maybe fourteen hours,

673
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:38,234
maybe eighteen hours,

674
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:45,808
rest of the time they drink, that's all.

675
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:50,574
We have one house being built next to us,

676
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,973
when we shifted there, they said,

677
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:55,074
"This is practically finished now" - still finishing

678
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:57,140
and will take at least three years more maybe,

679
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,907
may never finish.

680
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:02,274
It's like the mathematics, you see, you have this

681
00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:05,774
that there was a work and somebody came,

682
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:08,407
he did one tenth and ran away.

683
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:11,307
Then somebody came did one twentieth and ran away.

684
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:13,741
Then somebody came he did one fortieth and ran away.

685
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,907
When will the work finish? It will never finish,

686
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:20,040
with such running away people, never finish.

687
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,174
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga.

688
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,808
If you put mathematically,

689
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,307
Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America,

690
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:31,400
if you add up more and more of this kind of people.

691
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:35,774
So much is happening in this country,

692
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:39,074
but you have to see those people, you have to meet those people

693
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:42,873
who are at the helm of affairs, who are the people who matter,

694
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:47,507
who are scientific, who are talking about something sensible.

695
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:51,234
You have to talk to them, get to them.

696
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:57,107
We don't need cinema actors and actresses,

697
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:00,774
but we need people who are dynamic.

698
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:02,541
And this may work out

699
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:08,133
if you put your minds to it and we have something to show them.

700
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,607
I would say that Austria is one place

701
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:13,708
where Sahaja Yoga has worked very well,

702
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:19,234
Milan is another place and where most of them are professionals.

703
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:24,973
It's very surprising, in modern times we are living.

704
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,374
We are not living in those ancient times

705
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:30,973
where the Rishi Munis used to sit under a tree

706
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:35,133
and the kings used to come and touch their feet.

707
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:37,973
Is the other way round;

708
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:44,868
the Rishi Munis have to go and talk to the kings.

709
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:49,374
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis

710
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:51,474
we have to know that in a subtle way

711
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:53,341
we are still caught up into the webs of

712
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:58,973
our own understanding about life. So, that we have to change.

713
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:02,708
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga

714
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:10,734
and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others.

715
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:17,774
So I hope you will listen to My lecture today,

716
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:20,873
you will take the tapes home and listen to them

717
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:22,808
again and again.

718
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:25,774
Also there's a warning from people that

719
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:32,808
"Mother, what they do is to take one tape for one center

720
00:45:32,968 --> 00:45:35,973
and everybody listens it and then finished."

721
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:41,200
Meaning, you all should have one tape each.

722
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:44,374
Even that, people don't do.

723
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:46,808
Not only that, but now it might be after some time

724
00:45:46,968 --> 00:45:53,968
only one, one tape in circulation in one country.

725
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:57,641
They circulate; say, today in New York, tomorrow in Boston,

726
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:01,940
like that. You have to listen to it again and again.

727
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,708
Sit down with your paper and pencil,

728
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:07,007
see for yourself what I am saying.

729
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,708
Every tape should be with you.

730
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,940
I mean, these horrible gurus' tapes

731
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,140
you can hear them in every car, in every place,

732
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,907
everyone they have it.

733
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:23,634
And why is it Sahaja Yogis don't have any tapes with them?

734
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:27,200
You can make copies.

735
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:32,808
But if you can get it free, they'll like to have.

736
00:46:32,968 --> 00:46:38,734
That's the first thing, what we can get free, cheaply, easily.

737
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:44,234
If you try to save money, the money tries to save itself.

738
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:48,601
It's a mutual understanding.

739
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:58,940
It's as simple as this: supposing you open only one door,

740
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,207
no air will come in.

741
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,808
You open the other door the air will start flowing.

742
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:06,067
It's a circulation.

743
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:11,741
All this can be your own knowledge too,

744
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:14,968
I need not say anything, this is all in your brains,

745
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:18,174
only open out yourself, you are not free people.

746
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:19,541
If you are free like Me,

747
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:24,234
you'll see all these things coming from your own brains.

748
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,307
Specially for America, really, as you know, I am working very hard

749
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:33,140
and I want to work it out because,

750
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,307
if America is not all right, My Vishuddhi is not going to be all right.

751
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:40,100
It's going to trouble Me throughout.

752
00:47:41,968 --> 00:47:46,274
So you have to take it up upon yourself.

753
00:47:46,434 --> 00:47:50,133
I don't say, "Take the cross."

754
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:55,407
You don't have to sacrifice anything,

755
00:47:55,567 --> 00:48:02,507
but you have to be just aware about what are we,

756
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:06,200
what are we doing, where are we?

757
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:08,541
And on top of that,

758
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:14,567
Sahaja Yogis think they are obliging Sahaja Yoga and Me too.

759
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:19,940
This is something. It's to be explained this way:

760
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,641
I don't need Sahaja Yoga, you need Sahaja Yoga

761
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:24,840
and everybody needs Sahaja Yoga.

762
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,140
You had in this country people like,

763
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,674
I mean such great, great people you had

764
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:33,441
I need not mention - persons like Abraham Lincoln

765
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:38,901
who gave such great ideas to the whole world.

766
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:43,174
Why not you people be great?

767
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:45,007
He was a realized soul, all right,

768
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:51,000
but he didn't know anything about Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

769
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:56,033
Why can't you become great like him?

770
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:04,808
So on a Virata Puja we have to decide

771
00:49:04,968 --> 00:49:07,574
that we are all going to express

772
00:49:07,734 --> 00:49:13,541
the conception that was once the Virat

773
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,007
as reality in our lives.

774
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:20,601
This is what we have to pray from our heart.

775
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:27,574
And it's a very good occasion today to do that,

776
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:31,641
because we are sitting in a place where there were

777
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:38,407
so many of these aboriginal people, you call them, anything.

778
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:41,907
They were so sensible,

779
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:45,708
as in America you say brass tacks, you see.

780
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:54,007
They knew the principle how to lead a real spiritual life.

781
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:58,674
They were very free people, extremely free

782
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:02,574
and so detached.

783
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:04,940
So if you do not correct yourself,

784
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,407
then there will be a problem on collectivity.

785
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:09,274
If there's a problem in collectivity,

786
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:11,574
it will reflect on you,

787
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:14,541
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

788
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:17,674
If there's a problem in the whole being

789
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:19,341
there's a problem for you.

790
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:21,474
And if there's a problem in one part,

791
00:50:21,634 --> 00:50:23,774
there's a problem for the whole being.

792
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:26,808
Even Roosevelt who was your president once said that

793
00:50:26,968 --> 00:50:30,541
"Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

794
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:34,234
He could see this point so clearly.

795
00:50:35,234 --> 00:50:37,400
You see, all these sayings show us

796
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,341
that this is a country of Virat,

797
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:42,107
where they talk of collectivity,

798
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:45,808
they have all the communications

799
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:47,774
which are important.

800
00:50:47,934 --> 00:50:50,207
Every sort of communication is important,

801
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,374
but for Sahaja Yogis

802
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:54,741
it has to be very subtle, very dynamic,

803
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:57,174
very beautiful, very loving,

804
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:01,274
very impressive, magnetic.

805
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,968
Then only the communications will work.

806
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:09,840
There's no harm in wearing very nice dresses.

807
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,341
There's no harm in wearing - nice doesn't mean expensive,

808
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:21,067
but means which are sensible, dignified.

809
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,474
We have to build up our personalities,

810
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:31,567
that people should feel that "Oh, this is something, eh."

811
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:39,667
And your children will also learn from you.

812
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,140
There's no question of feeling that

813
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,907
you'll be driven into ego or anything,

814
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:52,067
that's finished now, ego is finished here, there's no ego.

815
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,541
What I find here is a justification

816
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:58,808
for doing nothing

817
00:51:58,968 --> 00:52:04,234
that we do not want to do anything because our ego will come up.

818
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:09,567
Very clever.

819
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,541
So with all this one has to know

820
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:23,107
that we are selected people,

821
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:26,607
we are chosen people of God.

822
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:28,973
He must have selected us with some purpose,

823
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:32,507
otherwise there are so many people in this country.

824
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:36,507
You are the foundation and you have to be solid people

825
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,868
to be the foundation.

826
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:42,541
Must know our own glory,

827
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,708
our own speciality

828
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:48,341
that why we are selected,

829
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,334
of all the people why are we there?

830
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,234
Then, what are we doing about it?

831
00:52:57,601 --> 00:52:59,741
Normal life you do see that way,

832
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:03,240
like if somebody is selected for a post or something,

833
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,808
out of many, many things, "Oh must be something about me,

834
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:08,808
I must show my worth, I must show my value,

835
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:10,907
I must show my work," you see,

836
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:17,641
and he works hard to prove that the selection was good.

837
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:20,674
But in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

838
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:22,907
you take it for granted,

839
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:25,441
"Oh, we are something great."

840
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:30,868
So now settle down with yourself - have a cup of tea.

841
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:40,407
I hope it has been understood why I am saying so,

842
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:43,607
because I am really concerned about America.

843
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,674
So many negative forces are working here

844
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:50,434
and we have to improve.

845
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:55,074
So many things such a big responsibility,

846
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:58,040
such a big country, such a vast country,

847
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:06,441
so much perversion, so much nonsensical ideologies,

848
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,374
I mean endless.

849
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:15,334
Even if you get fifteen Gorbachevs, you cannot change this country.

850
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:19,207
It has gone amuck.

851
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:21,774
Everybody's an individual,

852
00:54:21,934 --> 00:54:24,374
this mad place.

853
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:27,507
One Gorbachev can change that country

854
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:30,040
which has much more population.

855
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,207
But no one can change this country

856
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:36,667
unless and until you people decide to do something about it.

857
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,441
So I'm told some people are frustrated

858
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:44,207
because there are not so many Sahaja Yogis are coming,

859
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,641
but may be something wrong with you.

860
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,374
Maybe that you are not deep enough

861
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:52,834
and that you are not so much impressive.

862
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,174
You have to change your life style,

863
00:54:58,334 --> 00:55:03,701
you have to be smart people and spartan.

864
00:55:07,267 --> 00:55:13,040
I hope, I hope again and again that after this Virata's Puja

865
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,067
you all will come up on the stage as great Viratas.

866
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:18,934
May God bless you all.
