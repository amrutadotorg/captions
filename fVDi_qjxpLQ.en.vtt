WEBVTT

00:23.941 --> 00:30.364
This is the world that feeds the Swiss
Banks’ Octopus.

00:30.623 --> 00:36.896
This is the world where too much
is not enough.

00:37.097 --> 00:42.093
This is the world where negativity
is a plus.

00:42.294 --> 00:50.017
This is the world where the saints
say: “Enough”.

01:06.176 --> 01:11.038
1. This is a world where 1.3 billion
people

01:11.239 --> 01:15.257
live on an income of less
than $1 a day

01:15.458 --> 01:20.303
and where the planet does not have
enough natural resources

01:20.504 --> 01:25.296
to sustain, at a worldwide scale,
the consumption pattern

01:25.497 --> 01:29.233
of Malaysia, leave alone America.

01:29.434 --> 01:31.247
PLEASE SHRI DURGA,

01:31.448 --> 01:36.072
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:36.273 --> 01:40.906
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:41.107 --> 01:48.655
Shri Durga Namoh Namaha.

01:48.856 --> 01:52.375
2. This is a world where ten per cent
of world trade

01:52.576 --> 01:57.757
is generated by drugs and narco-traffics,
or US$100 billion

01:57.958 --> 02:01.914
represents the amount that yearly
poisons mankind,

02:02.115 --> 02:05.078
while money laundering in Switzerland
and elsewhere

02:05.286 --> 02:07.710
has become a most prosperous
activity,

02:07.911 --> 02:11.538
reaching all levels of society.

02:11.739 --> 02:14.898
PLEASE SHRI RAKTABIJA VINASHINI,

02:15.099 --> 02:19.283
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

02:19.484 --> 02:24.403
Om Twameva Sakshat

02:24.604 --> 02:34.195
Shri Raktabija Vinashini
Namoh Namaha.

02:34.396 --> 02:38.263
3. This is a world where Wall Street
sucks the wealth

02:38.464 --> 02:41.880
from the working middle class
to bestow it upon the rich

02:42.081 --> 02:46.318
and where Walt Disney makes you
forget all about it.

02:46.519 --> 02:49.099
PLEASE SHRI KATYAYANI,

02:49.300 --> 02:53.487
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

02:53.688 --> 02:58.425
Om Twameva Sakshat

02:58.626 --> 03:08.214
Shri Katyayani Namoh Namaha.

03:08.415 --> 03:14.152
4. This is a world where an Egyptian
eats at MacDonalds in Cairo

03:14.353 --> 03:19.804
and a Chinese at Pizza Hut in Beijing,
because modern consumerism

03:20.005 --> 03:24.719
expresses the lowest common
denominator of world culture

03:24.920 --> 03:30.492
and erases the meaning of national
values and traditions.

03:30.693 --> 03:33.522
PLEASE SHRI SHAKAMBARI,

03:33.723 --> 03:37.835
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

03:38.036 --> 03:42.491
Om Twameva Sakshat

03:42.692 --> 03:50.321
Shri Shakambari Namoh Namaha.

03:50.522 --> 03:54.731
5. The new multinational entities are
experimenting with new forms

03:54.932 --> 03:59.780
of dictatorship, setting their production
sites in the developing world,

03:59.981 --> 04:03.218
reducing to slavery a subdued
working class

04:03.419 --> 04:07.772
and exploiting children on the altar
of productivity gains.

04:07.973 --> 04:10.100
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHAKARI,

04:10.301 --> 04:14.358
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

04:14.559 --> 04:18.913
Om Twameva Sakshat

04:19.114 --> 04:26.968
Shri Rakshakari Namoh Namaha.

04:27.239 --> 04:32.335
6. The globalization of production and
services allow a few global players

04:32.566 --> 04:36.389
to befool us and impose the rules
of their game

04:36.590 --> 04:39.827
to the mass of unsuspecting
consumers.

04:40.028 --> 04:41.991
PLEASE SHRI BHIMADEVI,

04:42.192 --> 04:46.077
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

04:46.278 --> 04:50.586
Om Twameva Sakshat

04:50.787 --> 05:00.102
Shri Bhimadevi Namoh Namaha.

05:00.303 --> 05:04.758
7. Vast restructuration endeavours
are progressively leading

05:04.959 --> 05:09.112
to the eradication of small and
medium-sized enterprises

05:09.313 --> 05:15.722
for the benefit of gigantic corporations
operating on a worldwide scale.

05:15.923 --> 05:17.486
PLEASE SHRI CHANDIKA,

05:17.687 --> 05:22.489
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

05:22.690 --> 05:27.376
Om Twameva Sakshat

05:27.577 --> 05:35.531
Shri Chandika Namoh Namaha.

05:35.732 --> 05:40.972
8. The gradual concentration of liquid
wealth in the hands of the super rich

05:41.173 --> 05:45.915
is marginalizing national sovereignty
and its elected officials,

05:46.116 --> 05:50.761
and is imposing a titanic dimension
to the ruler-ship of money.

05:50.962 --> 05:52.749
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHASAGNI,

05:52.950 --> 05:56.574
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

05:56.775 --> 06:01.668
Om Twameva Sakshat

06:01.869 --> 06:10.026
Shri Rakshasagni Namoh Namaha.

06:10.227 --> 06:13.386
9. Greed raised to the power 108

06:13.587 --> 06:17.001
means the pauperization of the world’s
middle class

06:17.217 --> 06:21.239
and outrageous wealth for
the remaining 10%.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.077
PLEASE SHRI DAITYENDRA MARDINI,

06:24.278 --> 06:28.667
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

06:28.868 --> 06:33.291
Om Twameva Sakshat

06:33.492 --> 06:44.421
Shri Daityendra Mardini Namoh Namaha.

06:44.622 --> 06:49.491
10. The systematic elimination
of alternative economic solutions,

06:49.699 --> 06:55.652
unequal trade and financial manipulations
are challenging

06:55.854 --> 07:00.241
the equitable distribution of wealth
among the population of the world.

07:00.442 --> 07:02.228
PLEASE SHRI VAJRINI,

07:02.429 --> 07:05.718
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

07:05.919 --> 07:10.951
Om Twameva Sakshat

07:11.152 --> 07:18.260
Shri Vajrini Namoh Namaha.

07:18.461 --> 07:22.986
11. The deregulation of the financial
markets has opened wide the gates

07:23.187 --> 07:28.647
of Jurassic Park for the large financial
predators to roam about

07:28.848 --> 07:33.848
and thousands of billions of dollars are
created from nothing by speculators

07:34.049 --> 07:37.403
to feed their unlimited thirst for money
and power.

07:37.604 --> 07:39.898
PLEASE SHRI UGRACHANDESHWARI,

07:40.099 --> 07:44.593
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

07:44.794 --> 07:49.003
Om Twameva Sakshat

07:49.204 --> 07:58.528
Shri Ugrachandeshwari Namoh Namaha.

07:58.729 --> 08:03.486
12. The Swiss financial centre works
as a haven for rich tax-dodgers

08:03.687 --> 08:07.546
from developing countries, and diverts
needed capital

08:07.747 --> 08:11.772
from national investment programmes,
industrial infrastructures

08:11.973 --> 08:18.397
and social expenditure to inflate the stock
exchange of the developed countries.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.980
PLEASE SHRI UGRAPRABHA,

08:21.181 --> 08:25.222
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

08:25.423 --> 08:29.988
Om Twameva Sakshat

08:30.189 --> 08:39.434
Shri Ugraprabha Namoh Namaha.

08:39.635 --> 08:44.654
13. The trend of today’s mega mergers
is to marginalize the State,

08:44.855 --> 08:49.358
bypass national legislation, manipulate
the market,

08:49.559 --> 08:53.950
control the economy and, for all
practical purposes,

08:54.151 --> 08:59.369
finish off the social foundations
of real democracy.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.396
PLEASE SHRI MAHAKALI,

09:01.597 --> 09:06.282
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

09:06.483 --> 09:11.328
Om Twameva Sakshat

09:11.529 --> 09:20.657
Shri Mahakali Namoh Namaha.

09:20.858 --> 09:24.527
14. The lure and mirage of such a radical
concentration of wealth

09:24.728 --> 09:29.230
and power threatens to neutralize
all seeking of the Spirit,

09:29.431 --> 09:33.267
and the deafening roar of the triumph
of asuric materialism

09:33.468 --> 09:36.540
destroys the hope of millions
of seekers.

09:36.741 --> 09:38.486
PLEASE SHRI MAHAMAYA,

09:38.687 --> 09:42.983
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

09:43.184 --> 09:47.925
Om Twameva Sakshat

09:48.126 --> 09:56.617
Shri Mahamaya Namoh Namaha.

09:56.818 --> 10:01.326
15. The alliance of mafia, secretive
bankers and corrupt managers

10:01.527 --> 10:06.697
has infiltrated the world economy and
is threatening the ethics of collectivity

10:06.898 --> 10:13.313
which provides the foundation for the value
system of our entire civilization.

10:13.514 --> 10:15.580
PLEASE SHRI VIRATANGANA,

10:15.781 --> 10:20.498
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

10:20.699 --> 10:25.171
Om Twameva Sakshat

10:25.372 --> 10:35.284
Shri Viratangana Namoh Namaha.

10:35.485 --> 10:40.818
16. The enormous increase of financial
assets has siphoned cash money

10:41.019 --> 10:45.776
out of the real economy and channeled it
into the financial markets,

10:45.977 --> 10:49.174
building up a planetary gambling
casino

10:49.375 --> 10:53.473
where arbitrary currency speculation
can mount

10:53.674 --> 11:00.847
huge attacks against any country which
tries to follow socially-minded policies.

11:01.048 --> 11:03.556
PLEASE SHRI KHADGAPALINI,

11:03.757 --> 11:08.007
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

11:08.208 --> 11:12.429
Om Twameva Sakshat

11:12.630 --> 11:20.777
Shri Khadgapalini Namoh Namaha.

11:20.978 --> 11:26.850
17. The etheric sophistication of financial
electronic circuits has created

11:27.051 --> 11:33.285
a virtual world where the immateriality
of money has become the sole reality.

11:33.486 --> 11:35.093
PLEASE SHRI VISHNUMAYA,

11:35.294 --> 11:39.860
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

11:40.061 --> 11:44.301
Om Twameva Sakshat

11:44.502 --> 11:52.697
Shri Vishnumaya Namoh Namaha.

11:52.898 --> 11:55.881
18. The progressive domination
of technology

11:56.082 --> 11:59.903
is sucking the blood of the farmer,
the artist and the potter,

12:00.111 --> 12:05.842
turning the man who works with his hands
into a permanently handicapped person.

12:06.043 --> 12:08.870
PLEASE SHRI DEVA KARYA SAMUDYATA,

12:09.071 --> 12:13.207
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

12:13.408 --> 12:17.847
Om Twameva Sakshat

12:18.048 --> 12:27.857
Shri Deva Karya Samudyata Namoh Namaha.

12:28.058 --> 12:33.155
19. The information highway leads
to the maya web of a virtual world

12:33.356 --> 12:38.096
where human attention is scattered,
desire is confused,

12:38.297 --> 12:43.768
truth is atomized and the soul
is thereby reduced to slavery.

12:43.969 --> 12:45.715
PLEASE SHRI RADHA,

12:45.916 --> 12:50.482
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

12:50.683 --> 12:54.918
Om Twameva Sakshat

12:55.119 --> 13:03.039
Shri Radha Namoh Namaha.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.019
20. Modern communication can become
a domestic [may that mean “demonic”] tool

13:07.220 --> 13:11.738
in the hands of a few media moguls
and opinion-making tycoons

13:11.939 --> 13:19.062
which are spreading their hedonistic
world views of power, money and sex.

13:19.263 --> 13:21.383
PLEASE SHRI SHUKRATMIKA,

13:21.567 --> 13:26.037
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

13:26.238 --> 13:30.677
Om Twameva Sakshat

13:30.878 --> 13:38.933
Shri Shukratmika Namoh Namaha.

13:39.134 --> 13:44.008
21. The Mlechas of Satan have infiltrated
the Internet global village

13:44.209 --> 13:47.978
to pour pornographic dirt and filth
within the nest

13:48.179 --> 13:53.981
of the family and to spread hell’s shadows
in the minds of helpless people.

13:54.182 --> 13:56.212
PLEASE SHRI NIRMALA KUMARI,

13:56.413 --> 14:00.828
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

14:01.036 --> 14:05.969
Om Twameva Sakshat

14:06.170 --> 14:16.656
Shri Nirmala Kumari Namoh Namaha.

14:16.857 --> 14:21.869
Hail, salutations to the great Devi!
Aum, Amen.

14:22.070 --> 14:26.121
May there be Auspiciousness,
Joy and Peace.

14:26.322 --> 14:29.362
May Thy Divine grace penetrate
the waters

14:29.563 --> 14:33.376
flowing from our mountains to the four
corners of Europe

14:33.577 --> 14:38.753
and spread the pure vibrations
of the Aquarian Age.

14:38.954 --> 14:42.670
Salutations to Thee Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi Ji,

14:42.871 --> 14:46.694
the Resplendent One, O formidable
Avatar!

14:46.895 --> 14:51.293
We bow to Thee, most pleasing
yet most frightful,

14:51.494 --> 14:57.451
who has been approached by the Trimurtis
for the sake of protecting the universe.

14:57.652 --> 15:00.831
Today, in this festival of Navaratri,

15:01.032 --> 15:04.517
we chant the litany of Thy children
in Switzerland

15:04.718 --> 15:07.101
for the defeat of the foes
of the Spirit,

15:07.302 --> 15:15.167
and we offer to Thy glittering teeth
the new asuric forms of materialism.

15:15.368 --> 15:17.650
PLEASE SHRI RAKTADANTIKA,

15:17.851 --> 15:24.290
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

15:24.491 --> 15:32.378
Om Twameva Sakshat

15:32.579 --> 15:39.235
Shri Kalki Sakshat

15:39.436 --> 15:47.435
Shri Sahastrara Swamini

15:47.636 --> 16:00.277
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

16:00.486 --> 16:14.777
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha.
