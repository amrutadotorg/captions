00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.792
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:25.834
and you should know that the essence of Guru

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.626
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:36.918
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:41.250
faithful wife, of a sati.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.667
Her name was Anasuya,

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:52.083
and she was so religious

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.834
and so dedicated

00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.375
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:07.250
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:14.209
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:20.500
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:24.751
So all of them came down as sadhus,

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.709
dressed up like sanyasis.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:34.542
And she said she wanted to serve them,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.542
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:40.959
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.417
She cooked food for them.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.755
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:51.253
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:55.334
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.751
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:03.375
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.667
and then she became nude,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.709
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:14.125
And then she joined them together,

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:18.542
their three innocences were joined together

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:27.626
and they got their Gurupada.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.626
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.918
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.751
you have to be innocent.

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:47.083
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.959
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.626
But what is the nature of innocence?

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.375
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.417
First of all

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:12.667
He's endowed with wisdom,

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.500
and He puts wisdom into us.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:27.542
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:35.042
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.167
It is He who puts genetics in us.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:50.125
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:54.250
and when He puts wisdom in us,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.083
then we are wise.

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:05.626
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:10.542
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.334
They have no wisdom.

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:16.042
They do things without wisdom.

00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:21.542
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:25.902
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,
whatever it is.

00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:27.821
You may brand yourself with anything;

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.341
but you can see from their behavior they're,

00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:34.042
that they have no wisdom at all.

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:41.334
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:44.375
In some people who are not yet evolved,

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:47.417
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:51.042
this wisdom is lacking.

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:54.209
Apart from that,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.792
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:09.209
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:13.375
all kinds of bad habits.

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:17.834
We don't like to look at nudity.

00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:24.334
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:31.626
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.125
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:45.459
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:50.626
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:54.375
We are automatically dharmic.

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:56.542
We don't kill others,

00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:58.667
we don't aggress others,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.959
we don't torture others.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.417
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:10.292
or take away anything,

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:14.709
another's property or another's things.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:20.125
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:27.375
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.751
It is He only ultimately

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:33.834
who looks after us

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:38.751
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:42.250
because

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.417
He stops all other activities of excretion

00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:54.834
when you are ascending into new realm.

00:06:56.083 --> 00:07:00.042
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:02.876
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:06.542
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:12.209
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:16.334
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:20.792
So this wisdom is innate,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.209
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:29.918
He becomes, manifesting in us -

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:34.709
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:39.417
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:43.709
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:46.626
You become the child,

00:07:46.876 --> 00:07:49.417
at that time you become a child.

00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:51.667
And with the kundalini rising,

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:55.375
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:58.626
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:01.876
He's the power in the kundalini.

00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:04.918
He gives wisdom in the brain.

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:10.292
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:14.876
all your attachments which are wrong,

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:20.876
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.375
He changes, your genetics are changed.

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:28.334
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:30.876
about the same I would say,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:37.334
and the genetics of other people would be different.

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:40.500
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:43.834
because Indians normally are very wise people.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.584
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:49.792
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.459
Indians are very wise.

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:55.209
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

00:08:55.417 --> 00:08:58.667
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:01.334
when they go to India: they went for this school,

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:04.292
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:06.125
nobody could understand.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.918
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.542
They got malaria.

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:14.834
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:19.876
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:21.751
So they put a gate.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.918
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

00:09:25.209 --> 00:09:28.125
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:34.667
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.417
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

00:09:37.626 --> 00:09:39.709
he understands the importance of his life.

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:42.834
He respects his parents, he respects everything

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:46.542
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

00:09:46.918 --> 00:09:52.417
Automatically they know what is dharma is, 
you don't have to tell them.

00:09:52.918 --> 00:09:59.209
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:03.000
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:10.417
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:16.626
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:20.292
so much developed in these Western countries,

00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:23.959
people took to stupid things.

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:29.459
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:34.000
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:37.417
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:40.375
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.250
they have no Ganesha.

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:44.667
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:48.125
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:52.542
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:55.209
Before that you just call "holy father",

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:57.500
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

00:10:57.709 --> 00:11:02.000
which can create holes in the organization;

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:07.876
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:12.667
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:17.250
So this wisdom part is so important,

00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:19.626
and that's what we should ask

00:11:19.751 --> 00:11:22.000
Ganesha, to make us like children.

00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:27.751
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:29.125
This is the thing is,

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:33.250
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.292
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:43.792
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.083
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.292
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:55.125
because there's no strength from within.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.751
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:00.667
Now you know yourself,

00:12:00.792 --> 00:12:03.209
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:05.659
they behave differently, they stand differently,

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.292
they talk differently, they think differently, they

00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:09.918
- everything is different.

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:13.792
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:18.834
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:22.292
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:23.626
everything they did.

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:26.500
But how is it suddenly you changed?

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:31.626
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.
