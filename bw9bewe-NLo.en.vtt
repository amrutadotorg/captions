00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.375
The problem was

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.834
that we could not

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.500
arrange the cooking nearer your stay

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.834
when you were here to walk a lot.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.125
But that walking was, I think, quite nice

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.041
and must have helped you.

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:54.166
It's good for diarrhea and other problems that you have.

00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:03.041
Actually, I had seen the place but I hadn't seen the,

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.834
all the hostels and residential places.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:17.750
But for your information now somebody has donated Me

00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:21.500
one acre of land free, free of cost,

00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:24.834
next to the sea on the other side. It is beautiful.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:43.625
And you should all send him a letter of thanks for that.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:48.458
So for next year I'm sure we can organize

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.583
something much better,

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:55.834
in a much more collective way.

00:03:57.417 --> 00:04:02.709
Now the next tour is going to be,

00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:05.834
as you know,

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:11.250
via Pune, Rahuri, Akluj.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:16.250
And these places are of more importance to us,

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.500
because Rahuri is a place where My forefathers ruled,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.291
so it's a very powerful place,

00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:28.166
because they were great Devi bhaktas.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.625
Also all the Naths, like Machindranath, Gorakhnath,

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:37.250
all these great evolved souls called as avadutas

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:43.291
who were incarnations of the great Primordial Masters,

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.250
worked in that area.

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:48.417
They are the ones who talked of kundalini to begin with,

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.542
openly.

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:59.000
Then Pune, as you know, is called as Punyapattanam,

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:03.458
is a very holy place since ages.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:07.125
And then you'll be going to a place called Nira,

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:13.709
which is a river named after My name,

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:19.792
and this river has got lot of land around it

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.583
which we have purchased,

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:23.709
where we are going to do agricultural work.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.458
And also you will see there the Bhima River

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:28.917
where you'll have your morning baths,

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:31.125
and you'll enjoy the river part of it.

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.709
Also they have invited you for a function there.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.375
They have a very big function for two days.

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:38.000
That is why I am not coming,

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.125
because I wouldn't be able to do any programs

00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:43.458
during that time, but you enjoy yourselves there.

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:46.834
Then you are going to another interesting place

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.000
called Wani, which is a hill station

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:53.917
and a very beautiful place where there's a dam as well,

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.583
and then you'll be returning back.

00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm taking this opportunity to talk to you

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:10.250
because I seldom get time to talk to you.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.417
Now, as far as these outside things are concerned,

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:22.000
they should all nourish you for your ascent.

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:25.792
You have to see how much you have achieved within,

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:28.792
what kind of temperament you have developed,

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:30.999
how much detachment,

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:34.917
how much collective and how much generosity.

00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:37.917
All these things are to be seen.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.417
Judge yourself, don't ask others to judge you.

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.583
How much balance, how much wisdom,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.083
because all these things should settle you down

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:52.792
in a way that gives you the necessary balance.

00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:58.667
I do not know how many years more we can do this,

00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:00.792
but I think it's very good,

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:02.458
because now I see the difference

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.250
in the vibrations of people.

00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:07.458
Even before we had started in Ganapatipule and today,

00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:09.583
there is such a tremendous difference.

00:07:09.917 --> 00:07:13.667
Actually I am getting cool breeze from your side now!

00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:23.083
So the ascent is the main attention

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:25.875
and it's the main concern for all of us.

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:27.875
You have come here for your ascent.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.417
I know there must have been lots of difficulties

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:32.583
and lots of inconveniences;

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:37.291
some people also burnt their skin - I am sorry for that.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:42.917
But in this country overdoing is regarded as something

00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:48.417
improper, and we should try to avoid overdoing anything.

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:51.875
So by overdoing it

00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:54.709
we actually go to the right or the left,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.583
and so please try to avoid everything that is overdoing.

00:07:57.917 --> 00:07:59.583
For example, you may like your bath

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:03.875
in the Bhima River very much, but that's very nice

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:08.125
at a point where it is shallow;

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:10.667
but where it is deep, you should not go there.

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:14.458
I'm only worried on that point because it's still,

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:17.208
one has to understand to keep yourself

00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:20.583
in complete control and not to go to places

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.542
which are dangerous.

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.959
Apart from that it is dangerous to you,

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:27.750
it is dangerous to the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.083
and also to Me, because I get very worried

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:32.625
and upset if you get anything.

00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:38.875
So the main thing is

00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:44.041
that you should keep yourself in the center.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.750
Do not go to extremes in anything.

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:52.083
Everyone respects you if you are in the center,

00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:54.375
but if you go to extremes they think

00:08:54.709 --> 00:08:57.625
there's something wrong, basically wrong with you.

00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:00.667
And also it upsets the whole of the program.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.959
So My advice is that keep to the center,

00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.375
do not overdo anything,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.041
keep everything in proper shape;

00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:18.000
because it is strenuous for you people to travel like this,

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.625
to face this sun.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:22.000
This is the coldest time in Maharashtra,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.333
so you can imagine that what else we could do?

00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:27.166
I mean, we have to achieve the results

00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:31.375
with the maximum of combinations.

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:36.500
And I am sorry for the people who got these burns;

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:40.417
and actually because I had to treat them

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.750
and all that I was so delayed

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:45.750
that the whole program delayed, delayed, delayed - I mean,

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:49.625
it was too much. But now, no more of this.

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.750
Please don't go in the sun at all, there is no need,

00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:53.709
you have had enough of sun.

00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:55.999
And the sun melts your brain,

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:58.417
and that makes persons mad in this country:

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.709
if we go in the sun we end up as mad people.

00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.625
So must be happening to brains also something,

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:08.375
so it's better not to go in the sun at all

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.375
- keep it like that. Just for a while it's all right,

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:12.750
but don't sit in the sun.

00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:15.625
It's very inviting, I know, because you don't get the sun,

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:18.959
but there is sun's rays inside this room, everywhere.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.625
So you shouldn't go and sit in the sun at all.

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:24.375
That may really give you troubles,

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.542
because the sun in Akluj will be quite heavy,

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:30.834
and I'm telling you also this because I may not be with you.

00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:32.709
So please look after yourself,

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.458
that is the only thing you can do for Me.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.999
For yourself, you must do your meditation,

00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:39.917
you must worry about your ascent

00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:44.709
and don't leave your things here and there, be careful.

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:50.125
I am very happy the way they appreciated you

00:10:50.542 --> 00:10:52.792
in the Temple of Mahalakshmi,

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.250
and that they respected you

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:57.750
and gave you something in your oti,

00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:00.917
and that is something really very sweet of them

00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:04.333
to accept you so readily into their own style

00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:06.125
and into their community, you see.

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:08.041
And they said that, "We couldn't make out who is Indian,

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:11.125
who is not Indian", because I think in Ganapatipule

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.959
also your skin has become little

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:17.000
less pale and maybe they said,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.041
We couldn't make out who is who.

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:23.834
So it's very good that now things are working out

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:28.458
that we are getting little, little homogeneous temperaments.

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:35.458
Regarding pujas, as we had three pujas before

00:11:35.792 --> 00:11:37.834
and the fourth one in Ganapatipule,

00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:40.125
here also you'll have three pujas.

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:42.999
In these three pujas I'm sure,

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.834
this being a quieter group,

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:48.667
you'll achieve much more,

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.250
and things will be very much better.

00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:56.000
If you have any problems you can let Me know,

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:57.709
we can arrange all that.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.583
But one thing, be sure that you do not over-exert yourself,

00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:05.792
neither you starve yourself or overeat.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:10.999
Anything doing too much will not be good for this trip.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.792
Because I think in the second group

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.583
we are going to achieve much more

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:17.125
than what we had achieved before.

00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:19.583
So the second group people should try

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:24.458
to keep to a normal life, more attention to the spirit,

00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:26.999
more attention to their ascent.

00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:31.667
The last but not the least is the great news

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.750
that so many others want to get engaged.

00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:36.083
I'll be very happy to get them engaged,

00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:38.542
either in Pune or in Rahuri.

00:12:38.917 --> 00:12:41.500
It will be a very good idea, those who want to get engaged.

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:45.166
And if there are some people who still want to get married,

00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:50.875
let Me know. Maybe we might be able to arrange something

00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:52.583
in Rahuri.

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:55.999
But the best is that those who want to get engaged,

00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.417
it's very easy to be done,

00:12:57.792 --> 00:12:59.083
and it will be a good idea.

00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:02.333
So let Me know before we leave Pune,

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:04.542
anyone of such wants to.

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:07.166
Now if you have any questions or anything to be said,

00:13:07.417 --> 00:13:08.166
please say it now,

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:10.208
because I won't get such a chance to talk to you,

00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:13.083
this being such a small group here

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:14.792
- otherwise always in a puja;

00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:16.417
now in Pune you'll find at least

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.208
five times more people than you are.

00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:34.500
What's she saying?

00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:41.291
Hard time with your attention - what?

00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:52.083
What is it?

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:58.041
She wants to know how to settle her attention,

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.667
and how to go deeper in meditation.

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:05.041
Your attention goes to which places, is the point.

00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:08.375
You try to see around more.

00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:25.458
You see, first of all in meditation you must discuss this,

00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:27.709
and there are many others who can tell you,

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:29.000
they'll work it out.

00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:31.750
And secondly the best way, you see,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.625
is to put your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.500
Concentrate on the Mother Earth is the best way.

00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:40.375
When you are walking,

00:14:40.834 --> 00:14:42.583
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.250
If somebody is talking to you,

00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:46.458
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:49.000
You see, then you'll absorb everything better

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:52.917
and you'll be stationed better, all right?

00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:58.500
That's a very good thing to think about, that

00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:02.000
our attention should not be frittered away.

00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:05.917
Gradually you'll settle down.

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:09.500
I think most of you who have come for the first time

00:15:09.834 --> 00:15:12.625
will find it a little difficult in the beginning to adjust,

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:14.333
but gradually you will.

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:17.458
Because first of all our attention goes to small,

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:21.792
small things, like I have to sit on the ground

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:24.458
or You have to go by buses ,

00:15:24.709 --> 00:15:26.834
or some sort of a filthy thing you see somewhere.

00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:29.333
So the attention always goes to the defects

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:31.458
and the loopholes and to the filth,

00:15:31.834 --> 00:15:33.500
because attention has been like that.

00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:36.709
But then it starts going to the places of beauty.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.792
In little, little things you start seeing the beauty,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.250
in little, little things you start seeing the Divine.

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:44.458
And then that's the time you should know that

00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:47.792
your attention will enjoy everything.

00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:49.917
But normally you see the attention,

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:51.959
specially the kind of attentions we have,

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.375
goes to the wrong things.

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:55.792
What is the loophole? We start judging everyone,

00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:57.458
we start judging every place.

00:15:57.834 --> 00:16:01.000
Now see this place, if you sit here: to Me it is marvelous,

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:04.500
to you it may be just made out of what - this tin business,

00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:07.333
this, that; all that you will start thinking.

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:09.709
To Me it's beautiful,

00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:13.458
because I see these beautiful saris spread here

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.709
and the beautiful flower arrangements beautifully done,

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:18.041
something so special.

00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:21.041
And the background and everything done with such care.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:22.500
How did they go there,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.792
and how did they have these things tied up?

00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:26.041
It is remarkable.

00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:27.959
All these things come to My mind,

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.834
and I start feeling very overjoyed

00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.625
that My boys have worked so hard to put all these things up

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.041
and how nicely, how they must have arranged it.

00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:39.583
All these ideas come into My head and I feel very elevated.

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:42.500
I don't see the tins or I don't see anything else.

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:45.625
It is what you see, where your attention goes.

00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:49.000
So try to see something beautiful.

00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:52.333
There is so many beautiful things that one can see.

00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:55.500
Now where, what I see is the heart of My children,

00:16:55.834 --> 00:16:58.458
the way they have done it, isn't it?

00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:00.250
If you are a deep person you can see

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.125
how they have spread the saris sweetly,

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:04.709
how they have spread the flowers, how they've done it.

00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:08.375
So it is the attention: where does it go?

00:17:08.792 --> 00:17:11.709
When you start seeing for yourself, What is my comfort?

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:13.625
I should have this, I should have that,

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:16.041
then there is no joy.

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:19.333
But the joy lies in seeing the deeper side

00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:20.709
of what they have done for us,

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:21.959
how they have worked for us,

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.709
how they have brought things for us,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.375
how they have cooked for us with love.

00:17:25.709 --> 00:17:26.709
You are doing no work

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:28.834
compared to what these people are doing, no doubt.

00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:32.834
You are moving like royal people really, to be...

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.375
And they had to do it.

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:39.250
Specially Ganapatipule was very difficult place.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.375
People had to come all the way from Nagpur,

00:17:41.709 --> 00:17:44.125
fifty people came to cook your food.

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:47.625
Money is not everything.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.959
Even if you pay money, you can't do that. It's love,

00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:53.750
it's the feeling, it's the attention,

00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:58.125
it's the generosity of looking after the guests.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.083
And that is how one should enjoy

00:18:07.458 --> 00:18:10.542
how much they have done for us, how we are enjoying it.

00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:13.333
That's how your heart will become deeper and deeper.

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.000
But if you have a convex heart

00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:18.583
which always looks at something that's wrong, something bad,

00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:20.625
something this, or at things,

00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:22.500
What should I buy, what should I purchase?

00:18:22.834 --> 00:18:24.583
All that, that can go off, your head.

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:28.625
But if you want to purchase something nice with a good heart,

00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:31.125
then you will just find it whatever you want.

00:18:31.834 --> 00:18:33.959
And you can do it very fast.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.959
When I did big yesterday shopping for all the centers

00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:39.458
and all that - worth, I think,

00:18:39.709 --> 00:18:42.834
in one lakh of rupees perhaps - for all the Indian centers,

00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:45.583
and I did it in no time.

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.709
Because it was for them, I was much better off.

00:18:49.959 --> 00:18:53.834
If it was for Myself I don't think I would have done so well.

00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:58.000
But you'd be surprised, I never buy anything for Myself,

00:18:58.709 --> 00:19:00.750
I don't have time.

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:06.875
You people give Me so much, I don't have to buy, either.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.125
So it is how you look at things, how you do things,

00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:11.667
how you work it out.

00:19:11.959 --> 00:19:14.667
And yesterday the shop I went to was all full of fragrances.

00:19:14.917 --> 00:19:17.667
Everything there was fragrance and everybody was feeling it.

00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:20.625
It's just because I was enjoying the whole thing,

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:24.166
enjoying it, doing for others.

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.041
It's not others - who is the other?

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:28.166
Because Sahaja yogis are not the others for Me.

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:31.250
I am doing for Myself, but My greater being,

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:33.834
My higher being.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.500
That is how you should look at things, all right?

00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:39.999
Then you will enjoy.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.959
And now what I have to say to the people of Sangli

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.083
is that here we did a puja quite in the past

00:19:50.709 --> 00:19:51.875
and also did once again recently,

00:19:52.542 --> 00:19:55.667
and also in Sangli a lot has come in the newspaper

00:19:55.999 --> 00:19:57.458
and that is why a lot of work has been done.

00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:00.458
And here Sahaja Yoga can also establish itself here

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:04.250
because the atmosphere is very nice and silent,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.667
and also all the people here are ready to help.

00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:10.709
So to the people of Sangli I want to give a small gift,

00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:13.458
and please they should accept it, this is My request.

00:20:19.458 --> 00:20:23.500
There is also one more gift but it is still in the market.

00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:34.291
Who will take it? it is still in the market.

00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:43.792
I bought lots of things but they're yet not delivered,

00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:45.792
so one thing I have to give them.

00:20:46.792 --> 00:20:48.083
Bring it, come now.

00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:50.291
So this is our Sahaja yogi, Mr. Tawde,

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:54.542
who is a very big officer here. He has done this.

00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:06.583
This gentleman is Mr. Mali who is the district

00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:09.208
- what do we say to district ?

00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:13.250
- he is the district agriculture officer here

00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:16.834
who looks after the agriculture of the whole district,

00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:19.375
and he got his realization in '75.

00:21:19.667 --> 00:21:22.208
And now he is posted here, so he came for the puja.

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:23.709
All his family is here.

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:26.917
So Mr. Tawde who has done all the good work for you,

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:29.208
give him a hand.

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:33.625
Also here

00:21:37.166 --> 00:21:39.875
there is Mr. Yadav Sahib

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:44.834
who has published everything in the paper,

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:47.375
and who is the newspaper gentleman here.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.542
Mr. Yadav - give him a hand.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.250
They are so highly placed, but so humble - just look at that.

00:22:20.625 --> 00:22:23.166
He is the man who is in charge of the whole thing here,

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:24.500
he is the engineer.

00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:26.875
And he's the gentleman who is in charge of the,

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:28.709
all the districts agricultural activities,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.125
he is the officer in charge.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.250
And another one is the editor of the newspaper.

00:22:38.417 --> 00:22:41.834
You see, when people get egoistical, they just don't relate

00:22:42.166 --> 00:22:43.417
themselves to the surroundings.

00:22:43.834 --> 00:22:45.500
They don't understand how far they are.

00:22:45.834 --> 00:22:48.834
It's like a ball which you just give it a push

00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:50.417
and it goes up in the air,

00:22:50.709 --> 00:22:54.166
without knowing that it's just a ball full of air.

00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:57.417
That is why you call bumptious, you see?

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:02.792
So those who really are solid people,

00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:07.458
who have some solid training and solid upbringing,

00:23:07.917 --> 00:23:09.875
they don't get into ego trips,

00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:12.667
they don't get into these trips. They,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.417
they first of all become very humble,

00:23:16.792 --> 00:23:19.542
and try to learn and become humbler,

00:23:19.917 --> 00:23:22.583
and again learn and become humbler.

00:23:25.667 --> 00:23:27.999
Like Newton has said that:

00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:31.583
"I am like a little, I am like a little child

00:23:31.917 --> 00:23:34.709
collecting pebbles on the shores of Knowledge"

00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:38.542
- a person like Newton, he said so.

00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:42.125
But nowadays, I find

00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:45.417
it's difficult to find people of that kind.

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:48.125
But those who are very learned,

00:23:48.792 --> 00:23:51.792
in the West also I've seen them being very humble people;

00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:56.667
in their writings, in their whole behavior

00:23:56.999 --> 00:23:59.208
you can see they are very humble people.

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:03.542
Humility is a sign of knowledge.

00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:08.417
When the tree is loaded it bends down.

00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:12.000
When it is loaded with fruits, it bends down.

00:24:12.667 --> 00:24:17.208
In the same way a person who has knowledge will bend,

00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:19.750
will be very humble.

00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:29.625
Now, today's puja has really a lot of importance as it is

00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:32.625
today the Puja of Shri Mahalakshmi, and the importance

00:24:32.834 --> 00:24:36.125
which we have of Shri Mahalakshmi in Sahaja Yoga is of

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:39.375
no other Shakti. Because Shri Mahalakshmi is the Shakti

00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:42.250
which we call as the Sushumna channel,

00:24:42.542 --> 00:24:45.999
She resides in it, and through Her

00:24:46.166 --> 00:24:49.166
the parasympathetic nervous system is activated.

00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:51.917
To make this Mahalakshmini Shakti strong, in our evolution

00:24:52.083 --> 00:24:55.959
there occurred many events, and in this the

00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:59.625
important event was the incarnation of Shri Mahalakshmi.

00:24:59.834 --> 00:25:02.500
Shri Mahalakshmini took many incarnations,

00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:05.583
and She is so courageous that She took

00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:08.750
the form of a human body and took birth in this Universe,

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.917
and has done a lot of work.

00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:14.875
It is surprising that nobody gave us information

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:17.834
about all these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:22.375
and nobody has the deep and detailed description about this.

00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:25.583
Now the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is based

00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:29.959
on the Principle of Shri Lakshmi. That means the Mother

00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:32.208
of Shri Lakshmi is Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:35.375
we should say, the Mother of Shri Lakshmi.

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.250
That means when Shri Lakshmi comes to humans,

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.250
Shri Lakshmi is the one with balance,

00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:44.333
a woman in the form of a Devi.

00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:48.709
She is in such a balance that She stands on a lotus.

00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:51.375
She has two lotuses in Her hand.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.375
One of the lotuses is pink, and also in that

00:25:54.625 --> 00:25:58.166
lotus is also a tenderness. The meaning of the pink lotus

00:25:58.417 --> 00:26:01.999
is such that the person who is a lakshmipati, he will have

00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:05.667
Shri Lakshmi, that is in the character of that person

00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:09.709
will be this pinkness that means will have sweetness in

00:26:09.917 --> 00:26:12.500
his character. He should not be dry.

00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:16.500
The second thing is that if we would see a lotus, then

00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:19.792
in that lotus, even if a bee comes into it, this bee gets

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.667
also a place in it, and the bee has so many thorns,

00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:26.959
but even then it gets a place in the lotus. That means

00:26:27.208 --> 00:26:30.208
it is also welcomed. Therefore, the person who has

00:26:30.542 --> 00:26:34.250
Shri Lakshmi, he will welcome everyone, however the guest is.

00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:36.959
He will ask for the comforts of everyone,

00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:39.208
even if that person is small or big. He will take care

00:26:39.208 --> 00:26:41.999
of everyone according to their social status,

00:26:41.999 --> 00:26:45.208
he will be hospitable to everyone in a equal way.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.500
Third thing is that the meaning of it is

00:26:48.792 --> 00:26:53.291
that one should be generous. And if in the hand of a person

00:26:53.542 --> 00:26:56.959
there is no generosity, then such a person

00:26:57.208 --> 00:27:00.667
is not a lakshmipati. Danat (the quality of generosity)

00:27:00.917 --> 00:27:03.125
is such a joy-giving quality,

00:27:03.417 --> 00:27:07.000
and it cannot be compared with acquiring anything.

00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:10.125
The person who attains the power of generosity,

00:27:10.417 --> 00:27:13.000
I think such a person is the greatest of all,

00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:16.166
because such a person has reached to the

00:27:16.458 --> 00:27:18.875
culmination point in the evolution of mankind.

00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:21.959
One should be able to give generously. As Shri Lakshmi

00:27:22.166 --> 00:27:25.625
donates with the left hand, in the same way

00:27:25.917 --> 00:27:29.083
a person who is lakshmiputra (indicating the principle of

00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:33.000
Lakshmi in a man) should also give generously with his left

00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:36.834
hand in such a way that even the right hand does not know it.

00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:40.959
Giving with the left hand signifies giving very sahaj

00:27:41.208 --> 00:27:45.083
(spontaneously) without any effort. And all the desire

00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:49.417
must be only of generosity. And truly in this world

00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:53.041
there are so many material things, and I think for

00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:56.083
all these things there is only one importance,

00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:59.250
and that is these things we can give to others.

00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:03.166
By means of generosity we can show the greatness

00:28:03.458 --> 00:28:07.500
of our heart. We can show our affection and warmth,

00:28:07.792 --> 00:28:11.083
and that is why all these things have importance,

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:14.166
otherwise there is no importance of all the material things.

00:28:14.458 --> 00:28:17.458
There are so many statues of swayambhus. Amongst

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:21.125
them the statue of Shri Mahalakshmi is considered as the

00:28:25.917 --> 00:28:29.250
By Her grace our Kundalini rises in the channel

00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:32.875
of Shri Mahalakshmi. She is above Shri Lakshmi Principle.

00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:36.709
Now this (right) hand is like this.

00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:41.083
This hand is the symbol of shelter.

00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:45.417
It has two meanings: shelter - give shelter to everyone,

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.792
this hand gives protection to everyone. But in reality

00:28:49.041 --> 00:28:53.000
we see just the opposite. The lakshmipatis put a lot of

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.959
pressure and fear on everyone. On the contrary

00:28:57.208 --> 00:29:00.333
She (Lakshmi) is just standing quietly on a lotus,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.709
not showing off anything special about Her. Otherwise

00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:07.417
people need cars and this and that, to show that they are

00:29:07.709 --> 00:29:10.709
so wealthy and are superior in comparison to others.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.500
On the other hand She is not putting any weight or

00:29:14.792 --> 00:29:18.709
pressure on others. She is standing so lightly, so delicate

00:29:18.709 --> 00:29:21.291
that nobody should be troubled because of Her. The real

00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:25.125
lakshmipati will sit somewhere in the corner, will sit

00:29:25.333 --> 00:29:28.875
with complete faith and silence, and will leave quietly.

00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:32.000
Even if he wants to give something he will give

00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:35.375
and say, Shri Mataji, this is something which is

00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:38.458
my donation, but please do not disclose my

00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:40.917
name, and You accept it somehow. I have given this

00:29:41.208 --> 00:29:43.750
at Your Lotus Feet - finished now, I have nothing

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:47.041
to do with it any more. When I tell him that I do not

00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:49.792
take money but it is to be given to the trust

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.667
(and for which we have to know the name of the donor)

00:29:52.959 --> 00:29:55.625
he will say, You can put it in the name of anybody else,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.834
I have no objection. I have given this to You,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.375
I do not want my name to published. Only if You want to

00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:05.834
disclose my name to the income tax authorities I do not mind,

00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:09.333
but otherwise I do not want my name or anything.

00:30:09.583 --> 00:30:13.709
He will be requesting very humbly not to disclose his name.

00:30:13.917 --> 00:30:17.166
This person we can call is a real lakshmipati.

00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:20.583
The (right) hand of Shri Lakshmi is pointing up in this way.

00:30:20.792 --> 00:30:23.208
That means your attention should be above, towards a

00:30:23.458 --> 00:30:25.999
higher goal. So when a person becomes a lakshmipati,

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.041
then his attention is such that he starts thinking,

00:30:29.041 --> 00:30:32.208
Now I have become lakshmipati, but now, how can

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.000
I attain God? When this stage comes in a human being,

00:30:36.291 --> 00:30:40.125
he has wealth and he receives a lot of wealth. Becomes rich,

00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:44.083
and then when he gets the feeling of not achieving the inner

00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:47.959
richness, then one can say that the Principle

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.458
of Shri Mahalakshmi has been awakened in him.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.792
And in that Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi the Kundalini

00:30:55.083 --> 00:30:58.417
is awakened. When She is awakened that is why we say,

00:30:58.667 --> 00:31:01.750
"Udo, Ambe" meaning: "Shri Kundalini, please, get awakened."

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
We say this in the temple of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:07.625
because She can get awakened only through

00:31:07.959 --> 00:31:11.041
the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi. And thus She is awakened

00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:14.041
in the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi and then penetrates

00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:16.583
the above chakras, and comes up and completely

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:19.041
penetrates the Chakra of Sahasrara. Now let us see

00:31:19.333 --> 00:31:21.834
how many incarnations of Shi Mahalakshmi we've had.

00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:25.542
Firstly, the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is very close

00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:28.875
with a guru, a relation of plenty of love and purity.

00:31:29.166 --> 00:31:32.291
Now if we see from the beginning, by all the Adi Gurus,

00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:35.583
She was born to them as a daughter or as a sister.

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:39.333
Like the daughter of Janaka was Shri Sita - the form

00:31:39.667 --> 00:31:44.999
of Mahalakshmi. She was the Principle of Mahalakshmi.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.542
and She was the daughter of Janaka.

00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:50.166
Then the sister of Shri Nanaka - Nanaki -

00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:53.166
She was Mahalakshmi. Her relation was of sister.

00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:55.999
In the same way, the daughter of Mohammed Sahib, Fatima,

00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:58.709
She was Mahalakshmi. After Her, Radha was the form:

00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:01.417
of Mahalakshmi, then comes Mary:

00:32:01.709 --> 00:32:04.125
Mary was Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.083
and Her relation was of purity. She was so pure

00:32:07.417 --> 00:32:09.875
that with Her purity She gave birth to Shri Christ.

00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:12.542
So She was a form of complete pure Virgin.

00:32:12.917 --> 00:32:15.417
And as She was a form of Virgin, because of Her purity,

00:32:15.792 --> 00:32:18.291
She got a son pure as Christ.

00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:20.834
Because of these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:23.375
our chakras at the top within are being fixed up.

00:32:23.792 --> 00:32:26.625
That means Shri Rama's Chakra is on the right side

00:32:26.959 --> 00:32:29.875
of the heart, here She is in the form of Shri Sita,

00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:32.458
here She is in the form of Radha,

00:32:32.917 --> 00:32:35.333
here in the form of Mary. And at this place these powers of

00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:38.750
Shri Mahakali, Shri Mahalakshmi and Shri Mahasaraswati

00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:40.917
meets in the form of one Power which is Shri Adi Shakti.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.875
She recides in Sahasrara

00:32:44.208 --> 00:32:47.041
but it is said that in Sahasrara

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.542
She exists in a form of Mahamaya.

00:32:50.959 --> 00:32:53.583
Adi Shakti is of a form of Mahamaya.

00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:56.250
That is why the result of all these three Powers

00:32:56.709 --> 00:32:59.625
was like this, that Adi Shakti comes

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.458
into this world in the form of Mahamaya

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.625
and She can penetrate the Sahasrara of everyone.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.709
As you know, She is in front of you

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.041
and you know all about it.

00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:15.834
So I don't need to tell anything more.

00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:18.709
This is how, out of this Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:33:19.083 --> 00:33:21.667
Shri Adi Shakti was incarnated. She has got all

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:24.208
the three Powers of Shri Mahakali, Mahalakshmi

00:33:24.583 --> 00:33:27.333
and Shri Mahasaraswati. These Powers are within Her.

00:33:27.625 --> 00:33:30.000
Only through this Shri Mahalakshmi Principle,

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:32.959
our pure desire - which is Shri Amba, actually power of

00:33:33.333 --> 00:33:36.999
Shri Mahakali - can be awakened. She can do it.

00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:40.792
That is why Adi Shakti is so important, because through

00:33:41.208 --> 00:33:44.792
these three Powers, even if everything is ready, but

00:33:45.166 --> 00:33:49.000
at the last what work has to be done,She is need.

00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:52.667
That means the work is achieved through these Powers.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.208
Even if this thing is very easy for us to achive,

00:33:56.583 --> 00:34:00.041
we do get it easily, but still you have to work hard;

00:34:00.375 --> 00:34:03.999
otherwise that work cannot be done.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.333
It is quite difficult. If it would have been possible

00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:10.500
only by Shri Adi Shakti, then there wouldn't be any need

00:34:10.917 --> 00:34:14.166
of doing all such confusion.

00:34:14.542 --> 00:34:17.333
You have to work hard,

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:20.417
and your support is required to accomplish the task.

00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:23.125
You are on the stage now, not Me.

00:34:23.583 --> 00:34:25.917
You can take My power and use It,

00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:28.834
but know that now you are on the stage.

00:34:29.208 --> 00:34:31.834
And that is why you are worthy of worship. You are special.

00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:33.999
What am I? Whatever powers I have,

00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:37.083
I have them since eternity; there is nothing special about it.

00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:40.166
But you should use them. You must receive it,

00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:43.999
you must achieve it, you should have mastery over it.

00:34:44.417 --> 00:34:47.208
This is the real desire of Shri Adi Shakti,

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.000
this is Her pure desire. And for this pure desire

00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:54.500
She is striving very hard every moment. And in this

00:34:54.917 --> 00:34:58.000
you have all earned it, achieved it, accepted with love,

00:34:58.333 --> 00:35:01.333
and going ahead you have progressed in it.

00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:04.083
This is a very big satisfaction for Me.

00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.959
And in this satisfaction I forget everything,

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:10.291
like how much I had to suffer in the past.

00:35:10.583 --> 00:35:12.917
In the past many years I suffered a lot.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.250
How much Sita had to suffer, how much Radha

00:35:15.667 --> 00:35:18.959
had to suffer, how much Mary had to suffer:

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.500
I forget all that past. I feel

00:35:21.834 --> 00:35:24.500
as if nothing has happened in the past, and that

00:35:24.999 --> 00:35:27.417
whatever is happening now is something special.

00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:31.542
But in this incarnation one thing is to be remembered,

00:35:31.917 --> 00:35:35.417
that Shri Mahalakshmi has incarnated in human form

00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:37.959
- in human form. But the Devi which we call

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.792
as Shri Mahakali has not incarnated in human form.

00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:43.333
She always existed in the form of a Devi.

00:35:43.834 --> 00:35:46.583
That is why to come in the form of Devi is easy,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.959
but to come in the form of a human being is very

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.208
difficult task. And to fight like a human being and

00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:56.583
live with the human beings is even more difficult.

00:35:56.999 --> 00:36:00.333
Also to live, keeping within the limitations of human beings,

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.959
is much more difficult. All this work in the form of human

00:36:04.417 --> 00:36:07.875
beings was done by all the Devas, and today we are experiencing

00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:11.917
the auspicious fruits of all the work done in the past.

00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:15.750
The great work done in Ganapatipule is worthy to be written

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:18.917
in history; big work has been done, and it will keep

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:21.667
happening every year ahead. My ardent desire is that

00:36:21.917 --> 00:36:23.000
it continue at least for the next three, four years.

00:36:23.291 --> 00:36:26.417
If this happens, then you people will also get the idea, that

00:36:26.625 --> 00:36:28.625
what we've started from Ganapati

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:30.875
has reached perfectly Sahasrara.

00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:34.709
This is so Aditi (Primordial) that it's difficult to express

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
in words. And all this you should receive. You should receive

00:36:39.625 --> 00:36:42.875
whatever belongs to Me, this is My only pure disire.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:46.291
And when this works out, then I don't want anything

00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:28.500
Let the ladies do the puja.

00:39:28.917 --> 00:39:32.542
I will tell you what you have to do and you let them do it.

00:39:33.375 --> 00:39:37.250
Do not touch it, do not touch with your hands.

00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:41.583
Carefully, you should not touch the bowl even,

00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:44.959
you do not touch with hand.

00:39:45.417 --> 00:39:49.375
Hold at the edges. Only hold at the edge, and now put.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.542
Say Shri Sukta mantra, say of Ganapati Atharva Sheersha.

00:39:56.166 --> 00:39:58.125
Put.

00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:14.999
It is correct.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.792
Let them do it.

00:40:21.709 --> 00:40:25.542
No hands. Hold here.

00:45:00.999 --> 00:45:03.792
Now is so, all the men here,

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.667
first remove this here,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.875
and tell them to wash My feet.

00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.166
Put water on the feet and wash them.

00:45:12.583 --> 00:45:14.709
Say Shri Sukta.

00:45:17.083 --> 00:45:18.709
Put! Remove it.

00:45:29.959 --> 00:45:32.542
Do not put hand. Remove this, in that dish.

00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:43.999
This kumkum is very good because it's been vibrated.

00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:45.875
You all should take a little bit

00:45:46.166 --> 00:45:48.041
give with a spoon to everyone later on.

00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:53.458
Do not touch with your hands.

00:45:56.834 --> 00:45:59.583
Just bring water, not hot water.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.834
Puja should be done with silence and peace of mind.

00:49:42.542 --> 00:49:44.834
Nothing will go wrong.

00:54:41.625 --> 00:54:45.375
Now you see they did not use the word poverty; alakshmi!

00:54:45.667 --> 00:54:48.041
that means what is not Lakshmi Principle -

00:54:48.333 --> 00:54:52.166
that they did not say daridrya (poverty) word.

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.208
They did not say destroy daridrya, but they said alakshmi.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.750
See how subtle it is.

00:55:00.041 --> 00:55:02.834
All that is inauspicious,

00:55:03.208 --> 00:55:05.959
that which is not in the Lakshmi Principle,

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:10.166
all that - it covers a vast domain.

00:55:10.542 --> 00:55:13.750
This all is written after a lot of study

00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:17.417
- with clear and proper thinking.

00:55:17.834 --> 00:55:21.834
See the vibrations of it.

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:57.041
Oh, not into that.

00:55:57.709 --> 00:56:01.333
Earlier there was water in it, isn't it?

00:56:01.667 --> 00:56:05.917
Do it now; what can we do, now it has happened.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:09.166
That is what I was saying.

00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:15.125
Now pour it, now is no use, there is no difference.

00:56:15.959 --> 00:56:18.583
Now do it like this,

00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:21.959
listen to Me now.

00:56:22.333 --> 00:56:25.667
Put water on My feet, and keep it aside

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.999
without touching the water.

00:57:12.667 --> 00:57:16.959
From Kamal it goes to Vishwa, nothing in between!

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.041
Did you understand it?

00:57:19.375 --> 00:57:21.417
The description of the Mahalakshmi,

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:24.041
that She is very fond of lotus,

00:57:24.333 --> 00:57:26.333
and then She is fond of the whole universe.

00:57:26.625 --> 00:57:29.458
Nothing in between!

00:58:10.083 --> 00:58:12.750
Rub it on your hands.

00:58:55.959 --> 00:58:58.917
Now start hundred-and-eight names.

00:58:59.208 --> 00:59:01.625
Do you still have something on Shri Mahalakshmi?

01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:44.291
And this is the thing one should understand,

01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:47.417
that Mahalakshmi Tattwa becomes the Viratangana,

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.166
means the Buddhi, the brain

01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:56.875
- the awareness, we should say, She becomes that.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.291
Narayani Shakti, or we say Viratangana

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.875
is the power of Virata in the brain.

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:06.709
So lastly is the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi -

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:11.959
central nervous system is Mahalakshmi Tattwa also, in a way.

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:32.250
I'm just explaining to him,

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:35.458
what happens is this Mahalakshmi Principle

01:05:35.834 --> 01:05:40.500
starts after the Lakshmi Tattwa has been manifested itself:

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.709
means when the Lakshmi has been shown through affluence

01:05:44.959 --> 01:05:46.333
and the satisfaction of affluence,

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.709
then the Mahalakshmi Principle starts developing in us,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.667
that we think of our ascent.

01:05:52.083 --> 01:05:54.083
Then it happens that,

01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:56.709
that in our brain we have three Powers

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.834
- is Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:00.583
- above the Agnya Chakra.

01:06:00.834 --> 01:06:03.583
There it so happens that two Powers,

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:08.375
is Mahakali and Mahasaraswati, they are blessed by,

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:13.000
they are blessed by the Mahalakshmi Principle.

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:15.458
And Mahalakshmi Principle is basically

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:19.917
the Principle of Narayana. Narayana is the Vishnu;

01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:22.000
and Vishnu becomes Shri Krishna.

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:24.667
And this Shri Krishna Shakti which is here

01:06:24.999 --> 01:06:28.125
becomes Virata's Shakti there - that is Viratangana.

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:30.917
But when She mixes up with these two,

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:34.999
then the Mahamaya Power starts manifesting,

01:06:35.417 --> 01:06:37.542
because She's - you know how Krishna was,

01:06:37.834 --> 01:06:39.250
He always used to play tricks, this that,

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:41.125
hide this, do this, do

01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:43.750
- all those things start at this Power.

01:06:44.041 --> 01:06:46.709
So that's why it is not so starkingly open.

01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:48.999
Like the Mahakali Power is so open;

01:06:49.291 --> 01:06:53.291
Mahalakshmi Power is a, is a hidden Power, like Mary.

01:06:53.999 --> 01:06:56.625
Nobody could have believed that Mary could be Mahalakshmi

01:06:56.959 --> 01:06:57.959
or Radha or Sita:

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:01.500
simple, hidden away, but very powerful.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:05.333
But at the time of the Sahasrara it becomes Mahamaya.

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:09.583
People don't know how to find out the reality

01:07:09.999 --> 01:07:14.208
of the Adi Shakti. Do you follow that?

01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:19.458
She is the one who sustains the whole Universe

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:21.250
and She becomes the Spirit,

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.625
the Spirit of the whole Vishwa,

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:26.000
which Vishwa Gyaneshwara has written.

01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:32.667
He has said, Vishwatmake Devi

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.458
- the God of the whole Spirit of the Universe.

01:09:37.917 --> 01:09:40.125
So She becomes the Universe then.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.166
We can have two foreigner men and two foreigner ladies

01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:28.792
can come up, who are married.

01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.959
You shouldn't come, Richard, of all the persons.

01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:40.959
Please be seated.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.792
You'll always have a chance.

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:50.125
Those who cannot get this chance should come.

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:54.834
He's the first one to get up, I told you.

01:11:54.834 --> 01:11:56.917
Please sit down.

01:11:59.999 --> 01:12:01.875
Not from England, because English people

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:03.542
get a chance always, please.

01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:06.000
Must be from Australia or some places

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.583
where they don't get a chance.

01:12:07.917 --> 01:12:09.792
English people should give a chance to others.

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:12.250
You meet Me so often, you are there and wash the feet.

01:12:12.542 --> 01:12:13.583
Come along.

01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:16.542
Where is her husband? He's English, is he?

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.250
May God bless you. All right.

01:12:19.667 --> 01:12:22.125
So get some Australian people.

01:12:22.625 --> 01:12:24.999
Even if, I mean, you are not married to the same lady,

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:26.417
is not necessary.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.999
But some Australians or Austrians or some people

01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:31.083
who do not get a chance.

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:38.792
Spanish is good. All right. May God bless you.

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:54.999
English are the most privileged people I should say,

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:57.208
aren't they?

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.625
The feet you want to rub? You have never rubbed My feet?

01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:44.417
All right, come along.

01:13:46.959 --> 01:13:50.333
Now, hold it with the right hand, rub it with the left.

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:54.291
You have rubbed it - My feet, haven't you?

01:13:54.667 --> 01:13:57.625
You have rubbed. And you have rubbed My feet?

01:13:58.041 --> 01:14:00.166
Have you rubbed My feet?

01:14:03.542 --> 01:14:05.542
Have you rubbed My feet with water?

01:14:05.917 --> 01:14:08.625
You have done it, all right, then let him do it.

01:14:33.999 --> 01:14:37.667
See now the vibrations. You put your hands there.

01:14:40.417 --> 01:14:44.667
Better now? All right.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.792
May God bless you all.

01:54:44.250 --> 01:54:46.333
May God bless you all.

01:54:46.834 --> 01:54:49.250
May God bless you all.

01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:57.417
May God bless you all.
