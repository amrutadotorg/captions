00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:25.620
Today is the first day we are having this puja

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.040
in this country of Austria.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.700
This country is

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:46.290
an historical country with different upheavals

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.540
it has gone through

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.290
to learn so many lessons in life.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.910
But human beings are such that

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.580
they do not relate the calamities with their mistakes.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.910
That's how they go on repeating

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.370
the same mistakes again and again.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:20.540
The visit to Vienna was overdue

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.790
and I came on a day when we had

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.370
to celebrate the birthday of Machindranath.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:40.370
It's very auspicious for all of you that he should

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:46.950
be today complete his one year of life.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.370
I bless him with all the flowers,

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.790
the choicest flowers, of beauty

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.660
and bliss on him, and his family,

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.620
all his relations and his family.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.660
There are so many things which have been done for the first time.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:29.000
I should say, for the first time I've come to Vienna,

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.000
to Austria,

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:39.740
and the first time I've come to the birthday of a child,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.580
on his first birthday.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.620
And on an Ashtami, that is today,

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.120
is the eighth day of the moon,

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:57.450
"of the moon which is increasing, Shukla Pakshi"

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.370
that first time all the weapons of the Goddess

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.040
are to be worshipped.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.660
This was a great idea because these weapons

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.910
who work all the time,

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.910
not only to kill the evil

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.250
but to protect the good,

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.790
"were never worshipped before

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.250
and that today,"

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.870
if human beings realise

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.740
their importance and significance,

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.580
then lots of problems of atomic bombs

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.740
and all these things that have been created

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.000
could be solved by diverting them

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.870
to the right direction,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.830
using them for the destructions

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:07.620
"of the evil forces and not the good;"

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.200
also for protecting human life,

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.410
nourishing human life.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.410
The same weapons can be used in a wrong direction,

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.870
but, rightly used,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:41.000
they can be dedicated for the use of God's work.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.540
All that is created by human beings,

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.540
which looks apparently

00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:00.950
an instrument of destruction,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.290
but if human beings use their wisdom

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.200
they will find out

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.000
that all these inventions that have come to them

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.120
from the prompting of the Unconscious,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.160
are for the work of God.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.290
All scientific research,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.740
everything that has been done,

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.200
all these instruments that you have produced,

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.740
are for the use of God.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.620
In a way we can say

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.500
that human beings have worked

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:53.740
to create methods as instruments,

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:02.660
as social, economic, political institutions

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:12.580
to advance the mechanism of God's work.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.160
The Unconscious has worked through human beings.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.830
All these institutions,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.410
if they are put to the right side

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:32.790
of their activity and not to the hellish activity,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.160
they all can join together

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.200
to complete the work of the Divine.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:55.580
Like, in the East people believe

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:01.000
that God has created this beautiful body of human beings

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.160
and it is for human beings

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:13.700
to create beautiful artistic clothes to enhance the beauty

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.200
of what God has created,

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.740
to glorify the beauty of what God has created,

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.910
to respect the beauty that God has created.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.910
And that's what has happened

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.290
in many spheres of life, of human activities,

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.500
and should have happened in all of them

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.290
if they had used their wisdom.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.290
The question of knowledge

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.410
that I discussed before

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.370
is very important to understand.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.910
The knowledge that was forbidden

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.000
once upon a time, such as Adam and Eve,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.120
has been a big problem for human beings to understand.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.080
It was the case when

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.950
God created human beings first time,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.950
apart from the celestial beings, who were perfect,

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.080
that He wanted to see

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.620
if these human beings could grow

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.950
in their population and in their awareness,

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.410
in their innocence,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.410
they would become Self Realized.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.540
But it was an experiment,

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.620
and the human beings failed God at that time,

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.620
because they listened to baser promotions

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.790
or baser prompting.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.410
That's how they failed

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.660
and they lost their innocence.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:28.330
And the loss of innocence is the sin

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.620
which was first committed,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.540
and that sin took a different turn

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.540
for human beings.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.620
Now, that knowledge, what I've said,

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.250
is not this real knowledge.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.080
That was the avidya, the artificial knowledge,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.870
the knowledge that "I am something,"

00:26:54.450 --> 00:27:00.330
that "I am the doer", the ego."

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.870
Till the animal stage there was no ego,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.330
and then the ego started growing.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.080
We can say that's the beginning

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.740
of the original sin:

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.870
that "I am something.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.870
I am doing something."

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.740
"It's I who can do it". All right?"

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.910
So God said,

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.410
"Let's see. Let's see their little courage,

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.580
and let them decide."

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.540
So the plans were changed,

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.910
one had to think now that we should

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.790
get incarnations on this earth

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.910
to help these people, to guide them,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.410
to put them into a balance,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.910
to put them into proper understanding of dharma,

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.700
so they keep to that balance.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:01.330
But every time this "I" refused to accept the balance.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:08.740
And this "I" goes very far from reality.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.870
Today also, when we come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.330
I see people,

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.120
they don't grow very fast.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.740
Because of this "I" they have questions,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.580
they have doubts, they have problems.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.200
Because of this original sin

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.200
people cannot grow very fast.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.870
That, "I am the one, I am free.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.330
Why that? Why this?"

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.450
Who are you to ask questions?

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.250
Who has made you?

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.620
Have you made yourself?

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.450
What did you do to become a human being?

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.790
Why this kind of egoistical behavior towards God?

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.620
"Why God has made us? Why this thing?"

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.330
Who are you to ask any question?

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.200
But it is so, the questioning goes on,

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.200
and such people are very dangerous

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.330
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:18.870
If they have to come for puja, I'm worried,

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.870
not because anything will happen to puja,

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.830
but because we may lose them completely.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.410
Such egoistical stupid people get lost.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.700
As a mother I have simple compassion and love for them,

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:38.500
and I feel sad that they could have been saved.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.160
But this questioning mind of theirs

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.040
can drown them.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.160
This is the basic original sin

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.830
that human beings have created.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.950
Apart from that,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.160
we had the problem that we have come

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.830
from the animal stage to this stage.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:03.040
So there are animal brutal conditionings within you.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.830
Then we have gone through other conditionings,

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.200
which were created in the history

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.700
by the same mister "I"

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.200
who has started institutions,

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.830
who started organizing religions.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.500
For example, take Christianity.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.080
Christ came here to break your ego.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.040
On the contrary, people built a big ego out of it.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.000
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.000
who believe that

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.660
Sahaja Yoga is a Christian Sahaja Yoga

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.620
or a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.910
Still that lingers on, that lingers on,

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.790
that it is a Christian Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.620
"For Christians it has to be Christian Sahaja Yoga"

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.120
for Hindus it should be a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.660
"For Muslims it is a Muslim Sahaja Yoga;

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.250
it must relate to Islam,"

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.500
because they can't get out of their own conditioning,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.120
so it must relate to that,

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.330
it must explain everything that is there.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.500
They can't get out, you see?

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.000
It could be also a Catholic Sahaja Yoga

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
or a Protestant Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.620
Could be even deeper than that.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.620
Like that, you see, it goes on.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.540
So, you pull Sahaja Yoga

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.080
into your own categories,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.660
into your own small little cups.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.500
But it's just the other way round.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.740
Sahaja Yoga is the ocean, is a universal thing,

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.330
it is a MahaYoga.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.910
"It is not meant for Christians, Hindus, Muslims" or anything;

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.540
it is meant for human beings as they were.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.250
Have you got animals who are Christians,

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.200
Hindus or Muslims?

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.200
This all comes because of the original sin only,

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.620
that we are something, we are Christians,

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.910
we are Hindus, we are Muslims.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.660
In Sahaja Yoga, one has to understand

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.080
that all the rivers, whether it is the River Ganges

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.370
or the River Yamuna

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.540
or it is the River Thames

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.620
or River Danube, any river,

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.580
that all of them flow into the same ocean and become the ocean.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.040
They say that when all the rivers

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.790
flow in the River Ganges,

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.870
they are all called as Surasari, means "the River of the Gods."

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.580
No more people call them by the different names

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.040
of the tributaries that are there.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.910
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is the ocean.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.370
You cannot name it.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.000
Do not try to find its identity with other things.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.250
If you start doing that, then your mind

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.250
will start becoming that small little cup.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.540
And moreover, if you are coming from some organized religion,

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.450
it is very important to understand that organized religions

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.410
make your cup even stronger, it doesn't dissolve.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.040
If it is a disorganised religion,

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.200
then it is a cup of earthenware,

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.040
which can dissolve into this ocean.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.740
But if it is a solid, nice porcelain,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.450
Meisonn, there is no possibility.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.620
Then you are adhering to all that conditioning,

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.870
all that solidness, and then it's very difficult.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.450
All the time you have to bring in Christ

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.700
or you have to bring in Mohammad

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.580
or you have to bring in Zoroaster,

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.700
or someone like that who should be there to guide you.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.740
Now your guidance is your Spirit,

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.330
which is unlimited,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.540
so you don't have to bring any one of Them.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.950
They are all within you.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.000
They are all part and parcel of you.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.120
But to stick on to one person is again

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.120
a sign that you are not expanding.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.950
You know that you are all.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.330
You have got Shri Krishna within you, who is awakened,

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.040
you have got Christ within you,

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.740
you have got Ganesha within you,

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.950
you have got Brahmadeva within you,

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.290
and you have got Mohammad within you.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.910
"And you have got all of Them:

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.040
Moses, everyone, within you"

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.080
so how can you be identified with one person?

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.950
The reason is, you are still conditioned,

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.910
and you want to drag it into your own conditioning.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:14.500
So try to bring it at a position where there is no conditioning.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.330
We can see our conditioning worse works so much

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.540
with our style because,

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:30.790
as human beings, we have a habit of forming a closed sect,

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.370
"whether it is ourselves,

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.660
first we close ourselves as "I." "I am XYZ."

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.790
Then we can club together as,

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:45.790
say, "We are, say, people who use forks and knives".

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.330
There could be people who just use

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.700
the fork and knives this way can be clubbed together,

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.870
and the others who use this way can be another way.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.580
See, it goes on like that,

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.410
all kinds of stupidity

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.330
that human beings have to club together.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.910
All right, use the way you like, it makes no difference.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.700
You eat the same food, it digests the same way, and it works the same.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.080
But as far as the outside is concerned,

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.950
when it comes to human activity,

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.000
they will use the fork and spoon in a different way,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.200
somebody will use their hands, fingers,

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.410
and somebody will, I don't know, may use daggers.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.540
I don't know how they can manage to go to what limit.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.200
So, this is what it is.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.250
In doing something, in doing any activity,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.620
then only human beings make it a closed circuit,

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.450
that "This is how we do it. This is how they do it,"

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:41.080
how it is, the method of another party or people.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.740
This groupism is the worst of all

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.580
and is against the laws of nature.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.700
You can be individual, as far as your appearance is concerned,

00:35:52.950 --> 00:36:00.580
as far as your hair colour is concerned,

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.620
or your eye colour is concerned

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.950
that's that God has created you that way.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.580
But all other things that you have created are dead.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.580
All other clubbing methods you have created

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.250
are absolute of no value.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.950
They are just mythical.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.290
There's nothing truth in it,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.790
nothing that should be worth of considering.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.830
It is just a myth!

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.080
So one has to understand that there is nothing

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.160
like a Sahaja Yoga which is a Christian Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.160
Sahaja Yoga which is a Protestant Sahaja Yoga

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.080
or a Catholic Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.790
I find this at a very subtle point,

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.290
where people talk of collectivity,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.450
that they don't understand that we are not collective,

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.250
because we have so many tags,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.120
you see, attached to us,

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:58.580
like the conditionings of our own doings.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.580
It could be in Switzerland,

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.250
it could be in Austria,

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.290
it could be in Rome, or it could be in India, anywhere.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.580
These conditionings, we have to get rid of these.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.450
We should know we are human beings, created by God,

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:17.290
and whatever is within us that is real, created by Him,

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.740
is the only thing that we have to be

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.700
and all the rest of the conditionings

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.580
we should try to get rid.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.540
Everything is complementary.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.870
From this place you have to learn something,

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.950
from that place you have to learn something.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.830
Every place has something to learn

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.000
and to understand.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.660
And there is nothing that can be retained

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.500
by some people as something higher or lower.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.080
But of course, where this ego has developed more,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.000
this original sin has developed more,

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.330
there is a possibility

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:02.660
that such human beings must have created more conditioning.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.290
Naturally the conditioning is much more.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.700
Or where they have been not at all moving

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.740
about religion,

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.830
about God, and have been sticking on,

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.580
like, you can say, in Africa and all these places,

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.830
could be that the conditioning

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:24.290
could have been by the other forces,

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.580
called as Adibhautik,

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:31.160
means the ones which are created

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.160
out of what God has created.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.040
Like, if they see the moon,

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.040
they are afraid of the moon,

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.370
if they see the trees,

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.370
they are afraid of the trees.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:46.290
Sort of a mythical ideas about the nature itself.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.160
See, so there are two styles,

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.700
as you always know.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.410
One is where they create mythical ideas

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.040
about the nature,

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.410
the mythical side of nature,

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.660
that is Adibhautik

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.500
and Adidaivik are the mythical ideas

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.580
about what you can produce,

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:12.660
you are God, you are the devas,

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.290
and you want to create this.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.910
"I'm this, I'm that."

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.660
So there are two types of conditionings which work out,

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.000
and in modern times it is such a confused thing

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.080
that both these sides,

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.120
I don't know where they act.

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.660
For example, the other day I was coming

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.950
near the cemetery in Vienna,

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.580
and I was amazed that it was a cemetery

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.740
but it was catching on right Swadisthana.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.410
So I said, "All the bhoots must be acting now,

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.870
because I can't understand how can

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:51.160
a cemetery have a right Swadisthana?"

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:53.700
This is how it can be explained,

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.870
that all the bhoots are now active,

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.200
or maybe they are again born, you see.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.290
They must have been dead hundreds of times,

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.160
they must have created graves after graves

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.330
and only there are empty graves, and they are active now.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.620
Or maybe that the bhoots themselves are active,

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.660
they are no more there,

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.330
they have all disappeared from there. It could be that.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.870
So we have to judge now on vibrations

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.580
and not on our understanding

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.620
or what we think or what we understand

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.870
through this brain.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.000
By asking questions and by talking too much about it,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.870
you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.580
For Sahaja Yoga you have to have

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.370
that super state of mind,

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.370
where you can receive vibrations,

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.000
can feel vibrations and have to be

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.870
absolutely compromised on them.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.950
If there is still the tag of that ego so much

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.910
that you still question Sahaja Yoga

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.040
and think no end of yourself,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.620
it is better that such a person

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.540
should not attend the pujas,

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.370
not attend the pujas. It is kind to himself.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.410
It is being nice to himself that

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.410
such a person who has doubts should not attend a puja,

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.500
because puja is only meant for people

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.200
who have achieved and received that state of mind

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.410
which is called as Nirvikalpa,

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.250
where there is no vikalpa, where there is no doubt in your mind.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.120
If there are still doubts in your mind,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.160
your mind is still very powerful,

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.120
and it is going to put you down.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.330
So either before the puja you tell your mind to keep quiet.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.620
"Tell him not to talk now,

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.200
Better keep quiet, now I have to ascend"

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.290
and I have to receive the blessings of the Divine.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.620
"So just keep quiet, and if you cannot keep quiet

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.870
then I cannot ascend."

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.950
I have told you many a times it is like a donkey,

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.700
the mind is just like a donkey.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.950
If you go behind the donkey, it kicks you,

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.580
it will tell you,

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.580
"that you are the bad man, you are the worst man"

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.580
all the self-pity will come into you.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.370
If you go ahead with the donkey,

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.080
then he'll put his ears to you, you can hold him like an ego, you see.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.040
You can go wherever you want, and do what you like, "What's wrong?"

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.910
It will not control you.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.000
If you sit on top of the donkey

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:07.000
it will still play about with you, to see how you work out.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:11.830
So if you allow the mind to go here and there,

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.290
through your eyes or through your attention, or anywhere,

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.700
or through your tongue or your senses, it will say, "All right."

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.950
It will eat the grass on the sides, it won't move.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.370
It will move to this side, eat some grass, that side.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.290
Gregoire: At this stage, as You speak about it,

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.330
should I quickly translate for the French

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:28.660
who don't understand English?

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.120
Oh, you want to translate the whole thing?

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.620
Gregoire: I can in two minutes.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.830
I think later on, Gregoire, would be better,

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.290
if you could translate, because the flow is better now all right?

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:46.740
So this donkey, the donkey wants to eat the grass.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.410
He knows that you don't mind him eating the grass.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.200
All right, it goes round, eats grass,

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.540
all sorts of dirt, filth, whatever it is.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.330
Whatever you allow he eats, goes on eating,

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.200
all filthy things, all filthy thoughts,

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:00.370
all dirty thoughts and every sort of thing,

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:02.000
without questioning, you see?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.120
Only in Sahaja Yoga they come here and question,

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.870
but not when they have to eat filth and dirt and all kinds

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.540
of unholy things and sinful things, they never question.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.740
Then they'll say, "What's wrong?"

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.660
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga they will question it.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.950
Which is the holiest of holy?

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:21.660
Which is the greatest of greatest?

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.660
Only these gates are open to you.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.740
That's how you get it otherwise it is not,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.250
it's prohibited to all the people to achieve this.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:39.540
The water that washes My feet is the ambrosia,

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.740
is the tirtha,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.580
which was even prohibited to doctors in the olden days.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.790
Vaidyas were not allowed, and they had to fight for.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.120
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.790
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.200
Today you are placed at the position of Gods.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.660
But are you capable of that?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.620
Are you deserving that?

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.330
Or you are still questioning,

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.740
you have still problems?

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.660
Then it is better you are prohibited.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.200
It's a rare thing that you should take that ambrosia.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.040
It's in the Devi Purana Bhagavatam,

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.160
if you read, that they were prohibited to take it.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.540
So this is what it is,

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:24.660
that the mind goes like a donkey.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:30.080
But if the donkey knows the one who is the rider,

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.830
knows his ways,

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.790
and he knows how to control the mind

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.450
and he knows where it has to work,

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.540
the same donkey, the same instruments,

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.740
the same institutions,

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.620
the same things you have got around you,

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.660
will take you there with a faster speed,

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.000
with a very comfortable thing.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.740
So tell your mind today,

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.740
that we have had enough of it,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.080
playing with the mind.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:05.540
Now we want to be there in the realm of God.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.950
Tell your mind, fully, tell your mind.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.080
It is important.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.620
This is the mind which has taken you to all kinds of things

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:47.540
it has given you all the filth and dirt and all that.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.160
So just tell your mind.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:11.740
May God bless you!

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.500
So for today's theme,

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.080
we should say that we have to achieve

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.290
our innocence within ourselves,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.740
and feel the innocence of the Virata.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.700
The question of Ganesha Virata,

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.580
we can say, or Virata Ganesha,

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.700
where, in the Virata, the innocence we have to feel,

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:38.620
so that we become innocent, our sins are washed out,

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:44.700
that we are cleansed by that innocence,

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.080
"so that this "I-ness" is lost from you,"

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:53.620
this original sin is washed away from us,

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:58.330
and we become that beautiful being

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:04.080
who is the proud child of God,

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:11.740
and who is the prize of this creation.

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:16.740
May God bless you!

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.330
Now you can translate, Gregoire.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.160
It's all right. You can translate.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.080
I know it is long, but sometimes

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.080
I find that if the flow is not kept...

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.700
Gregoire: I'm sorry, Mother, I should not have interrupted.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:28.700
No, it's all right, it's all right.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.410
You can replay, and in that background

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.620
you will be able to, keep it low,

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.830
so that you can spontaneously

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.910
go on saying something.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.410
Will it be all right? To replay?

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.500
That will give you a proper...

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.450
Gregoire: I was just thinking three minutes for the French,

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:57.740
and three minutes for the Italian,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.040
in a very condensed manner.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:00.000
You can?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Gregoire: I can, yes.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.370
All right.

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.160
Many people ask Me, before also, that,

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:56.740
"Mother, why we became like this?"

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.700
Why didn't God just made us aware of ourselves,

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.200
without committing all these mistakes?

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:08.580
"And why we had to go through this all vicious circle?"

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.830
At that time, I didn't want to say that

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:14.200
you have committed the original sin,

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.950
that you have disobeyed God.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.500
Otherwise things would have worked out in a different way,

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.950
not have been so lengthy.

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.830
Because if you tell them that, then there is another thing

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:26.080
that happens to them is that they become left-sided

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.870
that they start feeling guilty about the original sin, you see.

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:32.540
So we have to jump from ego to the original sin part of it.

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:37.540
But that part of you avoid it, only one can say, in the beginning,

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.200
that evolution could not take place

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.740
without this freedom being given to you, you see,

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.740
because freedom was first tested,

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.290
that you were given a freedom.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.950
You had a nice place to live in,

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.290
you lived in the complete protection of God,

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:55.700
in the garden of Eden, you can say,

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.000
in the beautiful... everything was wonderful.

00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:59.870
Nothing was missing there.

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:02.080
But, despite that, human beings, you see,

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.450
when they had the freedom,

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:06.830
just the freedom was going to be tested,

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.620
immediately they took to these baser things, you see.

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:13.450
And that is the way God had

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:15.450
to then change the whole plans,

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:19.830
because the baser things of life were attractive,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.540
even with all the blessings that they had.

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:27.080
All the animosity and the, we can say,

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.450
all the animal feelings, we can say,

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:31.830
were still attractive to human beings,

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:35.450
and that's what was most surprising.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.450
And when these things happened,

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.540
naturally the freedom itself

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.290
had to go through the test of improvement.

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:48.330
And that test was all this whole creation of human beings

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:49.580
that took place.

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.500
But to tell them all that

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.160
"That it is only the original sin which has created a problem."

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:55.250
Then they feel then,

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:57.910
"Oh, God, why did You create the original sin?"

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.580
So it is better to tell them that it is inevitable,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.700
for your evolutionary process,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.700
that your freedom must be tested,

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.290
because if you have to enter

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.500
into the supreme freedom,

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.830
you must first know

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.580
whether you can bear it or not.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.290
And in seeing that ...

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.660
So, it took so many years

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.830
for human beings to grow into it, to understand that

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.290
the man cannot bear anything. He cannot bear freedom,

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.790
he cannot bear money, he cannot bear position,

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.450
he cannot bear comfort, he cannot bear anything.

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:32.830
And that's what now we are seeing in Sahaja Yoga also:

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.580
when they get comfort, they they are just sitting down again.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.120
When they get any blessings of material wealth,

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.160
it will happen which it was, again the same,

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.040
that Garden of Eden is coming back to you,

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:46.910
and when it starts coming back to you,

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.910
again you go back to the same stage. It's not good.

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:53.790
Now you must understand that you have to be supreme,

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.450
so you must master all this.

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.120
Nothing is important, nothing is important,

00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:58.910
only the Spirit is important.

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.450
Then only you can get out of ...

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.660
This is also can act as a temptation for you, you see.

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:07.330
All the blessings that are coming to you are temptations.

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.540
So you should be prepared.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:12.580
Nothing is more important than the Spirit, you see.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:16.330
We are prepared for any kind of thing to achieve the Spirit.

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:19.660
We are not bothered as to what blessings we get or anything.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:22.200
But what we want is the freedom of Spirit

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:24.450
which is not hankering after anything,

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:26.830
hankering after material things,

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.950
so that you will be like a lamp

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.250
which is giving light,

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.580
without getting involved into the lamp itself.

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:37.120
Whether it is of gold or silver or anything,

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:42.330
it can burn, the light, even if it is made of mud.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:44.660
That's what is to be achieved by Sahaja Yogis,

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:48.290
to be understood because this is a very precarious stage where,

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.250
I find, people are again drifting down.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.410
So now we have to humble down ourselves,

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.330
to say, "I have not known anything, Mother, so far, I have to know."

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.740
Because, this is the knowledge of the root,

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.080
which you do not know.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:14.540
This is a new knowledge for you. What can you question about it?

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.950
You don't know anything.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.580
You have to know about the knowledge of the root.

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:21.080
So humble down yourself,

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.040
and then only, you will receive the blessings of this new growth.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:30.790
That is the growth that is inward, inside, the Antar Yoga.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.040
Unless and until you humble down, it won't work out.

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:35.290
You have to humble down,

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.290
because as soon as you start asking questions,

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:40.290
it's your ego that is asking questions.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.830
So humble down and to grow into it,

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.410
and to go further with the knowledge of the roots.

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:54.910
It is surprising that in India only this knowledge

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:57.040
has been really sought after,

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:59.200
and people have gone very deep down.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.250
That's why every one of them had to come to India.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.910
Even Christ came to India to know about

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:10.160
how people are searching it out, to support them, to help them.

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:16.040
So it is important that the knowledge of the root has to be done

01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:20.080
in the area where it is more possible.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.250
"It is easier to do where the roots are not disturbed"

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.700
and that's what was the country, India,

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:27.500
where people searched it out.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.500
"But when they started growing out again,

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.200
they became stupid and foolish"

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.830
and when we see them, we see them, they're outside.

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:37.910
But we don't see what a tremendous work

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:41.040
the seers have put in India, tremendous.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.910
I mean, you take one of them and it is sufficient

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:45.620
to give you a full idea of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:50.160
You take a simple person, a very simple person like,

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:55.910
say, Sai Nath, who was, to look at, very simple,

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.500
but what tremendous ocean of knowledge he had.

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:00.950
Who was not educated or anything.

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.370
Nobody knows where He was born, what happened,

01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:06.040
from where He came and where He lived,

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:08.160
and how He came up to that age.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.950
No one knows about His background.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.160
Or you take Adi Sankaracharya,

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:18.910
or you can take Kabira, or anyone.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.290
For example, you take Machindranath.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.910
If you read about Machindranath, you won't know,

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.540
you'll think it's some sort of a mysterious knowledge he's giving.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.080
It's a tremendous work they did!

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.500
They went into all the left and the right, and everything they did,

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.540
all kinds of experimentations.

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.540
If you see the books they have written about the Nav Naths,

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.040
the Nine Nathas, and about Machindra's life.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:49.040
Machindranath went into such depth, and he found out so much

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.700
about the places where women were rulers.

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:55.540
I think it must be the Belgian place he must have been,

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.620
"where women were the rulers and

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:59.500
husbands were just like cabbages"

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.740
and this and that and all kinds of things He discovered and then,

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.290
what happened and how he tried to cure that.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.700
It's the movement in another direction, you see,

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:09.540
in the root direction, that how

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.290
these roots have gone and given rise

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:16.620
to such horrible trees here and there and that's how he worked out.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:21.740
And it's such a symbolic thing that you to understand their work,

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.330
you have to be really very deep

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.740
and very penetrating for which

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:33.700
the human mind so far is not able to see

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:35.540
the amount of work they have done.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.290
It's not possible to see.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.740
Like, if you see Adi Shankaracharya's descriptions

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.410
or that even Markandeya's description about your Mother,

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:48.500
it's remarkable how little-little things He could see.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.200
From where, from what angles.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.580
And every little bit of Mother he could see,

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.330
as a child would see,

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.740
you see, absolutely close to the Mother.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.870
That means the innocence was complete and perfected.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.620
Otherwise you can't see these points that they have seen,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.370
all the little things like the three folds of the Mother.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.790
How can anyone see,

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.250
but a child can see that three folds of the mothers are there,

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.580
that she has three folds in her body.

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.660
Only a child can see.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.740
It's tremendous, I tell you,

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.870
it's tremendous that innocence

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:26.120
their penetration and their courage.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:29.580
Need real courage to grow into that penetration.

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:34.000
So innocence is the thing which one has to achieve first of all,

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:38.040
but it should not be like this through Christ or through Ganesha,

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.450
it should be you who should have it.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.660
Means you are, you are the innocence.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:45.500
You don't have to say that,

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:47.790
you don't have to come through someone.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:53.370
You are that, you just directly can have.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:57.450
That business is meant for people who are not realized,

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.330
meant for people who are stupid,

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.250
meant for people who can not directly attain.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.200
You all can directly attain it.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.330
That is your blessing, that's the greatest thing

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.870
that you can directly achieve all that.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.250
But you have to get to that position of innocence

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.370
by which you become so subtle, so sukshma,

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.660
because innocence is the subtlest thing that you enter into

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:23.250
all the areas to know the knowledge of the roots,

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.870
knowledge of the Tree of Life.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.120
And it's not meant for the stupid egoistical nonsensical people.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.500
They become rakshasas I tell you, they are rakshasas.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:35.660
So we are not going to go their way,

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.580
we have to go the other way round.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.000
So we have to humble down within ourselves

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.870
and try to awaken your innocence,

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:46.120
once that is the holy innocence,

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.160
that pavitra innocence within you.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.200
In Sanskrit language there's no word for innocence, to the surprise.

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:05.370
Because for them whatever is the holy, auspicious, everything,

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.790
there's no word, separated from innocence,

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:13.580
because they can't think that there can be innocence

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.500
existing in the air like that.

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.620
It has to be inside something, you see,

01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:23.620
it is always sort of a cup that can only contain the water like that.

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.000
So they can not think,

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.740
can not think of water hanging in the air like that, you see.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.580
It has to have some cup.

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:32.620
"So they will say "auspicious time,"

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.120
"auspicious person" or

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:40.330
"auspicious thing", "auspicious night",

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.870
"auspicious day."

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.040
Everything is contained,

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:49.040
container, like a container.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:52.000
The container that can have innocence, you see.

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:56.250
So the auspiciosness. Again, auspicious. It's an adjective.

01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:03.250
There is nothing like saying that this is

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:05.450
a solid innocence, the shubbha.

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.660
Shubbha itself is an adjective,

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.910
there's no noun for innocence.

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:13.910
Innocent it can be, but innocence itself

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.500
doesn't exist for them

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.660
Because it exists everywhere that is innocent.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.200
It's such a wider idea,

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:26.370
it's a wider idea of the Virat Ganesha.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.580
When He is in the whole of Virata,

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.910
how can you put Him down as вЂ˜innocence'?

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.330
Is so much subtle,

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:42.450
too subtle to be made into a noun.

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:45.740
too subtle a thing,

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.450
and we have to become that subtle.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.000
May God bless you all!

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:25.250
You can start washing My Feet.

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.950
First, what we can do, is

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.120
that those who have not washed My Feet

01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:44.290
please raise your hands so far. He has not washed?

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:49.250
All right, come.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.250
These are the twenty-one names,

01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:09.830
these are the Twenty-One Names

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:16.000
of Shri Vishnu which is the aspect of your evolution,

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.910
of your dharma.

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.120
First the sustenance and then evolution.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.500
That's the Father within you.

01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:32.120
And so first because you are all seeking your evolution

01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:37.500
we invoke the twenty-one powers,

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:44.790
twenty-one powers of this Father aspect of God.

01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:46.580
Twenty-one powers.

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:52.160
These are the twenty-one names which represent

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.870
the twenty-one powers of evolution within us.

01:32:58.370 --> 01:33:01.120
Sushumna Channel has got

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.790
twenty-one powers.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.580
You can translate, in French it's better.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.410
Vishnu, Vishnu, it's the Vishnu power or,

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.580
we can say, the Narayana.

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.450
Vishnu is the Father.

01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:51.740
Krita Yuga. This is the Krita Yuga.

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:55.000
Krita means when where it will be effective,

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:58.290
when where it is going to be effective.

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.450
The work will be done. This is the Yuga,

01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:02.000
the times where it will be done.

01:39:02.290 --> 01:39:03.580
Krita Yuga.

01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:06.200
This is the special time which is in between

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.620
Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga,

01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:10.580
is the Krita Yuga where things will be done,

01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:12.540
work will be done.

01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:13.830
Resurrection time

01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:15.080
where your hands will speak.

01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:18.950
This is the thing. You see. Translate it.

01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:22.740
"Krita Yuga. "Kri" means "to do."

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:38.410
See, svatojayte, means the principle,

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:42.410
you awaken the principle of the whole universe,

01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:46.500
the principle of the universe and Pratye

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:51.950
means you give also the experience of that,

01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:56.370
so that he is the one who generates the principle

01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:59.370
and also he gives you the experience.

01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:15.120
pratye, pratye is the experience that proves,

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.370
that proves your existence, you see.

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:24.910
You give your own pratye, means you give your experience

01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:27.790
by which it proves that you exist.

02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:57.620
It should be "You are God in man", it would be better.

02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:00.200
God in man.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.200
He is not man, by any chance,

02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:08.870
how can you call Him?
