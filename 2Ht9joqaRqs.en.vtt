00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.840
1986-0324 Birthday Felicitations

02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.100
I bow to all the worshippers of truth and love.

02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:07.780
After hearing so many things about yourself,

02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:10.300
you just start wondering

02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:14.740
that I never knew all these things were there.

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:18.220
As

02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:22.540
kind as they are Sahaja Yogis,

02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:27.220
full of gratefulness,

02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:31.220
for I've done nothing for them.

02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:36.900
It's just in My own nature it works out.

02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:39.540
Like the Mother Earth,

02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:44.460
which sprouts the seed in her own nature,

02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:47.260
in My own nature,

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:50.780
you get your realization.

02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:54.740
I haven't achieved anything whatsoever.

02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:58.380
Whatever is your innate quality,

02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:02.020
you can never be aware of that.

02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:04.420
But I must say,

02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.620
I congratulate all the Sahaja Yogis

02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:10.940
for achieving this state.

02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:14.380
This is a very difficult thing to achieve.

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:18.620
As you know that human beings

02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:24.220
are crowded by so many things,

02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:30.300
that it is very difficult situation

02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:34.380
to understand what is absolute.

02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:41.740
Actually, we have also created some

02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:47.500
things around us which act

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:50.500
like jails,

02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:53.300
bondages,

02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:58.500
which are detrimental to our ascent.

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:02.780
I don't know how these scientists of that level

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:05.740
could take to Sahaja Yoga so well.

02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:08.140
I would say they're pure intelligence,

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:10.900
must have pointed out to them

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:14.260
that Sahaja Yoga is a simple method

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:19.700
by which you achieve your last breakthrough.

02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:22.180
As in a spacecraft,

02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:25.780
we have containers between containers,

02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:28.020
one into another,

02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:32.540
and when the speed

02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:37.740
of the first one, which is just a normal speed,

02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:41.740
is accelerated,

02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:49.500
then only it could go to that height where is the space.

02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:53.820
And to solve this problem, they built in a method

02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:58.140
by which the first container explodes,

02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:00.860
which gives an acceleration to another,

02:08:00.884 --> 02:08:02.954
then the second one explodes

02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:06.140
and gives acceleration to the third one.

02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:09.900
It goes on till ultimately

02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:13.220
the spacecraft enters into the space

02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:16.220
where there is no gravitational force.

02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:20.020
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga acts.

02:08:20.220 --> 02:08:24.740
Human beings have evolved through this explosive method,

02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:27.820
which we call as evolution.

02:08:27.847 --> 02:08:30.987
So we have come to a state where we are human beings.

02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:34.700
Now we are on a human awareness level.

02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:40.100
At this stage, we have to have the breakthrough,

02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:44.740
and for this breakthrough, something has to trigger it.

02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:47.380
As Dr. Vandikar has told you

02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:51.620
that even one raw cell,

02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:53.860
which represents negativity,

02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:58.340
can act and spoil all the rest of them.

02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:02.260
In the same way, one good cell

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:06.540
can activate it to do something good,

02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:08.740
like it has to be triggered.

02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:12.380
I told him that DNA is to be triggered

02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:15.460
by outer force to start.

02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:18.260
There is carbon, there is nitrogen,

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:21.860
there's oxygen, hydrogen, all built in amino acids.

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:25.780
But there has to be triggering from outside.

02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:29.220
And for that, in our country,

02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:33.740
when we had the knowledge of the roots of this knowledge,

02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:37.620
we found out that the triggering comes

02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:40.140
because there are avatars,

02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:43.100
they are incarnations from the Divine.

02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:46.660
So there is a parallel system that works to trigger it.

02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.820
One side is the evolution going on,

02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:53.940
another side is the entry of a triggering agent,

02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:56.340
what we call as an incarnation,

02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:59.860
or what we call as the avatar.

02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:02.860
Now this meeting point can only be achieved

02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:07.060
when human beings have reached the state of Self-realization.

02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:11.700
Otherwise, a doctor will have, say, a photograph of Christ,

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:14.020
and he'll say, this is the Savior I have,

02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:16.300
or he may have Shri Ganesha in his house,

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:19.020
and he'll say, all right, I've worshipped Shri Ganesha.

02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:21.220
But he would never try to understand

02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:25.780
that this Shri Ganesha exists within your body.

02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:30.820
That is a landmark of your evolution.

02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:34.740
On the Muladhara chakra, He exists

02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:37.580
and it is only to be awakened.

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:41.700
He won't believe that Christ exists on your Agnya chakra.

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:44.180
Till the Kundalini is awakened,

02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:47.900
how can they believe that these deities,

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:53.700
which are different milestones of our evolution, exist

02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:59.820
and that they act on the parasympathetic nervous system,

02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:06.820
affecting the activity of the others,

02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:10.940
we can say, other plexuses, which are physical,

02:11:11.140 --> 02:11:13.380
or also, say, ductless glands,

02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:19.220
and all the nervous system can be acted upon by them.

02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:24.460
For example, if you can just form a idea,

02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:28.100
like a scientist should, because if he's an open-minded person,

02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:32.500
he must keep his mind open to this hypothesis

02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:34.740
that is put forward before them.

02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:40.260
That supposing there is someone inside your being,

02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:46.660
which controls an activity which cannot be explained.

02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:51.140
For example, the Acetylcholine and Adrenaline,

02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:54.660
these two chemicals are chemicals.

02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:58.740
They are just chemicals and the chemicals act the way they are.

02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:02.260
But when they are in the body, they act very differently.

02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:04.940
Sometimes they relax, sometimes they augment.

02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:09.700
So the doctors are honest and they say

02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:13.820
that the mode of conduct of these chemicals

02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:16.260
in the human beings cannot be understood.

02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:18.260
Another simple example I'll give you,

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:23.420
that the body of a human being is such that any foreign body,

02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:28.260
if it enters into the body of a human being, is thrown out.

02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:30.140
It is not tolerated.

02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:33.860
But when the fetus is formed in the mother's womb,

02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:35.620
it's not thrown out at all.

02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:38.420
On the contrary, it is looked after, it is nourished,

02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:40.780
and at the right time it is thrown out.

02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:43.940
Who does that? If I say, it's done by Shri Ganesha,

02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:47.060
nobody is going to believe it, but it is.

02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:50.020
So if you can say, for example, in a country,

02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:51.940
if there is a problem you have,

02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:54.580
if you can go to the king of that country,

02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:57.140
you can solve the problem. It's very easy.

02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:01.780
So if the area

02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:06.220
which is covered by these deities are Kshatriyas, as we call them,

02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:09.460
if you can approach them somehow, these deities,

02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:11.180
and if you can awaken them,

02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:13.980
they can immediately release energies

02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:17.660
to solve the problem of that area. It's so simple as that.

02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:20.220
And to understand this, first of all,

02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:23.900
you have to be a realized soul. Now it is a vicious circle.

02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:27.740
When you are not a realized soul, then you start asking questions.

02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:30.020
You say, how can it be? It's not possible.

02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:33.220
How can Ganesha be within us? How can there be this?

02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:37.540
Now by saying this or by talking about it, nobody can convince you.

02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:41.060
Like somebody is blind, how can you talk to a blind person

02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:43.860
about the colors that you see?

02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:48.220
It's just a waste of energy and also it is very disgusting

02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:50.940
because the other fellow gets so frustrated with you

02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:53.860
and you also feel disgusted that you cannot explain

02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:56.860
to a blind man about the colors.

02:13:57.060 --> 02:14:01.100
But supposing if you can open the eyes of a blind man

02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:05.380
and if he sees the colors, then it is very easy to explain.

02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:08.100
And that is what Sahaja Yoga means, Sahaja.

02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:11.540
Saha means with, ja is born, is born with you.

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:15.260
For that you don't need any race, particular race

02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:18.500
or community or caste or religion or anything

02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:20.980
because innately we are all human beings.

02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:24.820
We all laugh the same way, we all smile the same way,

02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:28.660
we feel bashful the same way, we look at people

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:32.660
and people know what we are feeling about.

02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:36.060
For that you don't need that this is a Greek face,

02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:38.220
so Greek face laughs in a different way

02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:40.740
or an English face laughs in a different way.

02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:44.100
So basically we are all just the same

02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.620
but God has created this variety

02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:49.900
to make life interesting and beautiful.

02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:55.060
Inside ourselves the innermost part of us

02:14:55.260 --> 02:15:00.540
is this special instrument which God has created within us.

02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:05.260
In different Yugas or in different times

02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:10.860
when we were born as Amoeba, it started or we can say as carbon.

02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:14.780
So we start with carbon ending up to the human level.

02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:17.820
Now at the human level we have crossed the Agnya,

02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:23.100
that is Christ's advent that happened two thousand years back.

02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:27.980
Now the only job is to break through here,

02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:31.700
to come to some compromise.

02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.060
We have to know that Christ would not tell us lies, was He?

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:38.820
Telling us lies that you have to have your baptism,

02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:41.780
that Christ said that you are to be born again.

02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:44.540
But instead of understanding Him, what He said

02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:47.260
that you are to be born again, we just self-certify ourselves,

02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:49.580
I'm born again, I'm a Christian

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:53.060
because I've been baptized artificially by some priest.

02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:56.660
Or some Brahmin also says that I'm a Brahmin

02:15:56.860 --> 02:15:58.340
because he has a ceremony,

02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:00.740
when he was eight years of age he becomes a Brahmin

02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:02.780
or born in a Brahmin family.

02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:06.420
You cannot be born in any caste or community,

02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:09.380
you are a human being, straight forward thing is that.

02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:11.940
That is what God's laws are.

02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:14.060
He treats you as a human being.

02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:17.580
He doesn't treat you as an Indian or an American

02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:19.220
or an English or anyone.

02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:23.220
For Him this world is one and that you are a human being

02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:25.940
which are at the epitome of your evolution

02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:29.380
and that you have to now break through.

02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:33.300
When you break through, what happens is that your Spirit,

02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:36.820
which is the reflection of God Almighty in your heart,

02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:40.340
starts emitting light in your attention.

02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:43.740
That means now if you put attention to someone,

02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:50.340
you can feel the different centers on your fingertips.

02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:54.420
Our Dr. Rustom is making a thorough study of Koran

02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:57.180
and My father also translated Koran and Sharif into Hindi

02:16:57.220 --> 02:17:00.180
and I happened to be very close to him on this.

02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:02.980
And what he has told that,

02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:07.500
Mohammed Sahab has clearly described at length kamaya,

02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:12.140
that is the kayama, is the evolutionary process

02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:18.860
by which a state of, we can say, revelation will come.

02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:24.660
At that time of revelation, at that time of resurrection,

02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:27.780
your hands will speak. He has clearly said it.

02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:31.620
Even namaz is nothing but raising of the Kundalini.

02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:35.340
Of course, in this great country of ours, thousands of years

02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.700
people have been talking about Kundalini.

02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:40.100
Fourteen thousand years back you can say

02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:44.460
that people have talked about Kundalini awakening like Markandeya.

02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:47.580
Even before that, Indra got his realization.

02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:52.060
But it was never accepted in India that you can get realization

02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:55.180
just by joining some organized religion or anything.

02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:58.180
That's why religion was not organized in this country,

02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:01.100
thank God for that. Once the religion is organized,

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:04.620
then the unrealized people start organizing the religion

02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:07.580
the way they are and then they create a big barrier

02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:10.740
for people who want to achieve reality.

02:18:10.940 --> 02:18:13.700
Reality is what it is, you cannot make it,

02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:15.780
you cannot conceive it, you cannot force it

02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:19.380
to be the way you want to be. You cannot organize it either.

02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:21.580
It is what it is and you have to see to it

02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:23.580
that it is so.

02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:26.780
For that, what he said to surrender.

02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:29.100
Surrender doesn't mean that you give away your money,

02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:33.980
give away your brains. It means that ego which is there,

02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:36.620
which says, no, no, no, how can that be?

02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:42.060
This is a personality which we have developed within ourselves

02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:46.780
which makes everything look mythical, which is reality.

02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:49.580
You start challenging everything that is reality.

02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:52.140
Now between this vicious circle,

02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:54.300
the breakthrough is very difficult

02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:58.380
because if you talk to a scientist, it's very difficult.

02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:00.740
You see, they will start asking questions to you like,

02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:03.220
I would say, a person like Dr. Vorlikar,

02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:04.820
I mean, he's so knowledgeable.

02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:08.940
But somehow I have this knowledge also about atoms,

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:12.140
this, that, so he gets impressed by My knowledge that,

02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:15.660
but it's nothing great that I have, it's just I know it.

02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:19.180
So if I tell him, he feels impressed that I know all these things.

02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:23.500
But still if he does not want to accept to go further with it,

02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:27.180
that this knowledge is useless, this doesn't work out.

02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:31.060
You see, what works out is this All-Pervading Power of God,

02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:32.780
which they do not want to believe

02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:35.260
till they have an experience of it.

02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:38.780
I'll tell you an experience, how people experience it.

02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:41.820
In the beginning when I was working on some seven English people,

02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:45.020
you'll be surprised, for four years I was struggling with them,

02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:47.300
four years for seven English people,

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:49.780
and it was so difficult.

02:19:49.980 --> 02:19:54.020
Imagine Christ, who was just given a public life for three and a half years,

02:19:54.220 --> 02:19:57.140
what could He have achieved? And after that,

02:19:57.340 --> 02:20:01.660
I mean, after their realization and all that, one of them,

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:02.420
he said,

02:20:02.620 --> 02:20:06.180
All right, Mother, you said that once you are a realized soul,

02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:09.820
you get charged with collective consciousness.

02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:14.900
I said, yes, your central nervous system

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:16.260
expresses that.

02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:21.060
That is what vida is from veda, that is what we call it,

02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:23.020
is realization.

02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:25.140
So he said, then I should know about my father,

02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:28.260
who is not telephoned to me. I said, all right, you just find out.

02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:30.300
Put your hands and ask the question.

02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:32.380
He asked the question

02:20:32.580 --> 02:20:35.460
and he gets a burning on this finger here.

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:38.420
I told him, now this means your father must be down

02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:41.180
with very bad bronchitis, because this is Vishuddhi chakra,

02:20:41.380 --> 02:20:43.460
on the right hand side is bronchitis.

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:46.500
This is, these are all the centers of your father.

02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:47.740
He couldn't believe it.

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:49.380
So he telephoned to his mother,

02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:51.060
and mother came on the phone and she said,

02:20:51.250 --> 02:20:53.250
exactly the same sentence,

02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:56.900
your father is down with very bad bronchitis.

02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.460
So when you start seeing

02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:01.700
that this is something beyond,

02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:04.900
that whatever communication system you have,

02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:07.100
whatever computers you have,

02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:08.900
whatever you have created,

02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.780
is really the copy of what you are inside.

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:14.100
But when the inside starts working,

02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:17.700
you are amazed at the fantastic qualities you have,

02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:19.780
the fantastic powers you have,

02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:22.060
and you just start using them

02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:24.580
as soon as you develop

02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:29.580
complete faith through experience,

02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:33.100
not a blind faith, but through experience.

02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:34.540
Then you start using them

02:21:34.740 --> 02:21:37.100
and you are amazed how it works out.

02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:40.020
Like in India, people get realization

02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:41.620
with the other difficulties.

02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:43.380
So, you see, one gentleman told Me,

02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:44.540
Mother, if You ask them,

02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:45.940
who is your kula swamini?

02:21:46.140 --> 02:21:47.700
And ask the kula swamini to say,

02:21:47.900 --> 02:21:50.580
is Mother your kula swamini?

02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:53.380
And vibrations work out.

02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:56.140
This is the knowledge of the roots,

02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:58.660
and to go to the roots, as Shri Krishna has said,

02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:01.260
you have to go back in the Urdhva Gati,

02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:03.020
to the ascent, to the brain.

02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:04.460
The roots are in the brain

02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:06.420
and the awareness goes downward,

02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:08.100
and when it grows downward,

02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:10.540
we go to Adho Gati, downward movement.

02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:13.060
In that, we start becoming nothing

02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:16.500
but ultimately a sex point or something like that.

02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:20.220
So, to achieve the knowledge of the roots,

02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:22.660
we have to have an Urdhva Gati,

02:22:22.860 --> 02:22:24.900
that is the ascent, and for the ascent,

02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:26.180
there is Kundalini.

02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:29.340
Though Shri Krishna has not talked about Kundalini,

02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:30.660
He has not said a word.

02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:33.540
But we are so grateful to Ganeswara,

02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:37.380
who was our great poet and a saint of Maharashtra,

02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:39.460
who very clearly in the sixth chapter said

02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:42.340
that it is the Kundalini which gives you the ascent.

02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:44.380
Of course, 14,000 years back,

02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:47.060
Markandeya has talked about it so.

02:22:47.260 --> 02:22:51.740
But the way then Kabira or Nanaka

02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:54.180
talked about it clearly,

02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:57.820
we should now know that we have to have this ascent.

02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:00.100
We are not on the absolute point.

02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:02.940
Whatever is our knowledge is not absolute.

02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:05.540
You put ten children with their eyes tied

02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:08.020
and ask them, what's the problem with this gentleman?

02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:11.100
They will all raise their one finger supposing this one,

02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:14.300
means the person always feels guilty.

02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:16.900
But if they raise this finger and this finger,

02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:20.420
the fellow is suffering from angina.

02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:24.020
Without opening their eyes, they will tell you the same thing

02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:29.340
because knowledge not only is absolute but is the same.

02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:32.860
Whether I'm wearing a saree with a zari or not,

02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:34.700
you can see with your own eyes.

02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:38.740
In the same way, whether this gentleman has this problem or not,

02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:41.460
you all can see with the eyes of your hands

02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:44.500
and you can make it out, what's the matter with this person.

02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:48.940
Now if you just learn how to overcome that,

02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:53.260
if you can find out how to do it, if it is decoded,

02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:56.900
the message is decoded to you and just told to you

02:23:57.100 --> 02:24:02.220
how to find out and how to rectify, then you are a master.

02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:04.580
And that hardly takes for some people even

02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:07.340
eight days are sufficient for them to master it.

02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:10.660
It has to be simple, it cannot be difficult.

02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:13.180
People think that it has to be very difficult,

02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:14.980
Kundalini awakening has to be difficult.

02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:16.580
It could be for people.

02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:19.860
I would say that supposing you put a seed inside this wood,

02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:21.540
it won't sprout and then you'll say,

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:23.420
it's very difficult to sprout the seed.

02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:25.420
Put it in the proper place,

02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:28.500
which is authorized for sprouting the seed.

02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:30.660
And then it works out spontaneously,

02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:33.020
has to work out spontaneously.

02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:35.780
And when it works out, it's the easiest thing to do

02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:40.580
because you are on the principle, on the essence of everything.

02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:42.300
Once you are on the essence,

02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:45.020
you can create so many permutations and combinations.

02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:47.380
And this exactly is Sahaja Yoga.

02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:49.980
I don't know, all these tributes have been paid to Me,

02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:51.460
it's very kind of them.

02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:56.180
And the age now I have reached also is something

02:24:56.380 --> 02:25:00.220
says that now Sahaja Yoga has to prosper very fast

02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:01.700
and it has to.

02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:06.300
Men have to, women have to become Self-realized souls.

02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:10.460
That's the part that God has asked us to play.

02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:14.980
Those even who do not believe in God, like Russia, China,

02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:18.180
also they, they feel the vibrations.

02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:21.660
I've given realization to many people in Russia and also in China.

02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:23.740
Thanks to My husband's job that I travel

02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:27.180
and they have tremendous respect for Me, tremendous respect.

02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:30.460
And they think that there is something, a power like that.

02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:33.300
And they have been asking Me, what sort of a power is this?

02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:34.780
We want to know all about it.

02:25:34.970 --> 02:25:37.290
And a day will come when it will spread there also,

02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:39.900
though it is spreading more in the democratic countries

02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.300
because there is freedom to spread it.

02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:44.860
But in the democratic countries there is also freedom

02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:47.620
from demonic things to develop more.

02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:50.500
And that's why is another fight one has to do.

02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:54.940
So the life becomes easier if the person who is a seeker

02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:56.820
tries to find it.

02:25:57.140 --> 02:26:01.620
The truth, in a truthful, honest manner,

02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:03.780
we have to verify it by saying,

02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:06.740
what sort of a life the guru is leading?

02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:10.180
What are his leanings? What is his seeking?

02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:13.580
What does he do? You can find out.

02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:15.220
It's very easy to find out.

02:26:15.420 --> 02:26:19.660
But if you just want to have a retainer like a guru,

02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:21.900
you can have it.

02:26:22.100 --> 02:26:24.900
The mistake is not so much of the gurus

02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:27.140
because they are out for a business.

02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:30.380
But the mistake is of the seekers

02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:33.260
because they do not want to understand

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:35.420
that you cannot purchase God.

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:37.140
You cannot purchase a saint.

02:26:37.340 --> 02:26:39.460
We have here Tukaramma, as we have seen it,

02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:43.220
that when Shivaji Maharaj,

02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:47.540
the great king of this, noble king of this Maharashtra,

02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:51.580
brought all the ornaments and everything for his wife,

02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:52.660
he told her,

02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:55.060
No, we don't need it. We are just villagers.

02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:58.820
What do we need these ornaments for a queen?

02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:02.540
You are not a queen. You better return it.

02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:06.380
But if you are a queen, you have to live like a queen.

02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:09.260
But that doesn't mean that a person who lives like a queen

02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:11.380
is attached to it.

02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:15.180
Whether you wear it or not makes no difference to such a person.

02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:18.540
Thank God, we have so many examples in this country

02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:20.180
of these great saints.

02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:23.620
And especially this Maharashtra has so many saints

02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:28.180
who were such great incarnations, I should say,

02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:30.860
who brought forth the main essence

02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:33.700
that you have to have your Self-realization.

02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:36.980
Otherwise this human life is useless.

02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:39.060
It is all going to be wasted.

02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:41.700
All your endeavors, all your enterprises

02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:44.380
will end up into nothing, into zero

02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:46.810
unless and until you are a Self-realized soul.

02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:49.940
That's why I always say that Maharashtians are

02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:51.900
about to become Sahaja Yogis.

02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:55.140
It's very easy to make a Maharashtian a Sahaja Yogi.

02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:58.220
In the same way it is easy for Indians also.

02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:02.140
And surprisingly so many seekers are born in America, so many.

02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:06.020
So many are born in England, so many are born all over the world.

02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:08.740
There are sixteen countries where we are operating

02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:10.580
and I find so many are born.

02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:15.060
But the problem is that they have no knowledge whatsoever

02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:18.780
about the roots,

02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:22.860
no knowledge about the knowledge of the roots.

02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:24.860
They think the tree is everything.

02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:29.540
So for them those people who can maneuver or manipulate

02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:33.700
or can find out ways of impressing them can cheat them.

02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:36.860
It's the greatest sin to cheat a seeker.

02:28:37.060 --> 02:28:39.660
But people are doing it from this country

02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:42.660
and we should be ashamed of them, the way they are behaving.

02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:47.780
In 1972 when we had a big lecture on,

02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:51.980
in Kavasi Jhange Hall, I named them, I told their names

02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:53.860
and I said, this is what is happening.

02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:58.260
Still I saw so many Indians going after them and getting hit.

02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:03.220
Everywhere they have really created such menace,

02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:08.980
such poverty, such illness that a mother can only weep

02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:11.860
and say that these are the seekers of truth

02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:15.020
and mislaid and deceived by these people.

02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:17.540
So all of you who are Sahaja Yogis,

02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:23.380
who are felicitating Me today, here on this birthday,

02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:26.980
I have to say that I've been traveling too much.

02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:30.260
I want you to be My hands, to help Me out.

02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:33.580
Go out all the way, everywhere that is possible.

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:35.860
Spend your time to spread the news

02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:37.700
that everybody can get realization.

02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:40.260
You are all empowered to give realization.

02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:42.420
Dr. Warren must have given to thousands,

02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:44.900
Mr. Modi must have given to thousands,

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:47.140
Rustom must have given to thousands.

02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:48.820
You all can give realization.

02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:50.300
So many of you who are sitting here

02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:52.660
have given realization to so many people.

02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:55.620
So first of all you have to give them realization

02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:57.500
and establish their realization

02:29:57.700 --> 02:30:01.300
and make them empowered fully as you are

02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.180
and then let them go ahead.

02:30:03.380 --> 02:30:05.740
It's very simple to enlighten another light

02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:06.980
because you are enlightened

02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:09.980
and then this light can enlighten another light.

02:30:10.220 --> 02:30:13.660
But first of all we must respect our Self-realization,

02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:16.780
develop into it because that's your glory.

02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:19.660
That's what you have to achieve, that's the end of life.

02:30:19.860 --> 02:30:22.300
That's where your human awareness finishes

02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:25.420
and you jump into the space where there is no thought,

02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:27.300
no worries, nothing.

02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:29.980
You are in the realm of God's Kingdom.

02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:31.260
Then He looks after you.

02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:33.860
So many miracles now people are talking about Me,

02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:35.780
Mother, you have done this, Mother, you have done that.

02:30:35.980 --> 02:30:36.820
I just keep quiet.

02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:39.260
Because it is the All-Pervading Power

02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:41.540
which is like an ether which acts everywhere.

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:44.260
It's like the ether that gives you television,

02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:46.260
scenery or a vision.

02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:47.980
But this is more than that

02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:52.260
because when you put your attention to somebody across,

02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:53.580
then this attention,

02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:56.260
as if from the television the man gets out

02:30:56.460 --> 02:30:59.300
and treats you, gets you well and goes back.

02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:01.580
This attention acts

02:31:01.780 --> 02:31:04.300
and this is the attention of God's love.

02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:07.700
So the whole thing boils down to the love of God.

02:31:08.020 --> 02:31:10.820
We have never used the power of love of God.

02:31:11.020 --> 02:31:13.540
Whatever we have issues, whatever we fight for,

02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:16.460
is some sort of a hatred.

02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:18.380
Never the power of love.

02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:20.500
And when we use the power of love,

02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:24.140
it's the most effective, most accurate,

02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:27.420
most efficient and so clever.

02:31:27.620 --> 02:31:31.620
The whole intelligence is so much above

02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:34.540
all the stupidity and all the crookery of the world

02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:38.380
that you are amazed how suddenly you find everything is worked out.

02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:40.700
You have to trust yourself.

02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:44.780
You all have this power, just get it and build it up.

02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:48.700
I hope this birthday of Mine

02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:52.260
will give you one request from Me

02:31:52.460 --> 02:31:57.500
that please, please devote your time

02:31:57.700 --> 02:32:01.700
to your self-evolution and for the whole world.

02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:03.540
Don't live for yourself.

02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:06.460
You have to live for others, you have to give it to others.

02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:09.060
This is to be spread if you have to save the world

02:32:09.260 --> 02:32:12.340
from all the calamities that are so shocking.

02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:14.660
May God bless you all.

02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:28.740
After this, we are going to have our program

02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:33.340
in a little dance recital by Miss Vorlikar

02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:36.660
and then there will be Shri Chitti Babu's program,

02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:38.220
which is very interesting.

02:32:38.420 --> 02:32:42.180
And if you don't mind, I would like to watch that,

02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:44.100
sitting down, if you allow Me.

02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:47.700
But nobody should come to touch My feet.

02:32:47.900 --> 02:32:51.980
If you allow Me to sit down, I'll be able to enjoy it more.

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:53.460
But for that I have to request

02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:55.580
that nobody should come and touch My feet,

02:32:55.780 --> 02:32:57.620
because any time I want to go down,

02:32:57.820 --> 02:33:00.180
everybody start touching My feet, the whole program goes off.

02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:02.020
Otherwise I'll sit here.

02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:03.580
Is it promised?
