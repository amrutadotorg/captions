00:04:45.610 --> 00:06:47.790
Today's Puja we have arranged of Durga or
the Kali.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:55.700
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:09.690
This we had to do it in France, because I
feel very strongly that day by day, in general,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.260
France is going down and down and down.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:23.810
While you people are coming up, the rest of
the France is in the most pitiable condition.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:32.840
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church, which - perhaps you are not aware

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:42.170
of, perhaps maybe - because you don't read
any other languages, you just read French

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.840
compulsorily by this country.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:58.850
So you have no international views or international
news that this Catholic church has done so

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:11.370
many horrible things in the past, that is
unbelievable that they have anything to do

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.690
with God.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:22.493
They burnt many cardinals in the heart - roasted
them.

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:27.900
Not only that, they killed so many people
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.330
They were much worse than Muslim people.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:42.210
They went to other countries like South America,
America - all these places they're all Catholics

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.080
- even our country.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:53.300
And they killed millions and millions of people.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:09:05.510
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,
one of the things as I said yesterday is that:

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:15.260
you will have to pay for whatever you have
done, on mass scale or individual scale.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:25.130
If that is the case, then one must know that
France has to pay a lot and this Catholic

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.589
church has to pay more.

00:09:28.589 --> 00:09:40.700
Catholic church has just taken out yarns out
of their heads and started a theory of original

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.700
sin.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:48.600
That's how to condemn every other Incarnation,
every other Prophet - that they were all with

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600
original sin.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.830
And even they said Mary was born with original
sin, for many popes they were discussing it.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:10:05.960
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus religion
of Catholic church had to establish itself

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:18.280
by forcing people, by torturing them, by taking
all their ideas into their own control, give

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.560
them funny ideas like original sin.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:33.750
Another is that you must confess, giving them
the left Vishuddhis.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:42.260
They treated women as nothing and to Mother
of Mary they called Her a woman.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.980
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday, is
a fact.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:56.220
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis to understand
how this Catholic church is so dangerous and

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.160
has been doing such harm.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:08.350
As there has been so many books about it - that
you people don't read, because it's not in

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.350
French.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:16.160
There are English books from America - you
must learn English.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.380
It's very important now I feel, that all the
French must know English, they must read English.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:33.000
French will not give you the international
personality that you are supposed to acquire.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.400
You had some scholarship, not much.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:46.070
The real scholarship comes from England and
also from America in English language, and

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.430
also from India.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:56.610
One gentleman who tried to translate all these
things in UNESCO, he was thrown out by your

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.610
media.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.310
Your media is taking full advantage that you
don't read any other newspapers; they are

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.750
doing whatever they feel like.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:16.780
All kinds of scandals, all kinds of sensationalization
- whatever they want to write, they write

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.940
in free press.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:27.040
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings, let them to go to Freud.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.210
Freud is the dirtiest man you can think of,
who has put his ideas into your head.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:41.570
But as if you are already brainwashed people
that you accepted all that.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.270
How could you accept Freud?

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.640
If Freud had come to India, they would have
killed him in no time!

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.170
What happens is that, somehow or other - I
don't know what is the reason, I don't know

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:58.640
where to place it, but the wisdom is not there.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.730
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.880
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880
But what about the French?

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.880
They have not been able to mature but they
have become extremely frivolous.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.700
Maturity is finished.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:25.770
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:35.230
In India, young people are called as stupid:
you call it gadha pachisi, means in 25 years

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.590
they are donkeys.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:43.440
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:54.430
And gradually by this movement from Catholic
church to Freud, what has happened that you

00:13:54.430 --> 00:14:02.200
haven't got your own personality to understand
what is right and what is wrong.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.920
Of course I must say Sahaja Yogis must have
done lots of punyas and must be very courageous

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.110
people to be born in this country.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.900
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:21.140
The law is so funny that they said it depends
on the mood of the magistrate.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:31.780
(Shri Mataji laughing) You see the magistrate
doesn't know the law.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.260
Such a stupid country in modern times I've
never known.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.810
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.630
Of course in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.470
But here is so-called modern people.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.521
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

00:14:51.521 --> 00:14:52.750
If you ask them, "What is the law?"

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.880
They don't care.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.671
It's the mood of the magistrate.

00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:06.490
Now supposing he has had a big drink in the
last night, second day he comes with a hangover,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.810
so finished.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:15.470
And then he will be very much biased towards
the drunkards only.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:29.180
So here it is becoming such a horrible society
that Indians would be shocked, beyond doubt,

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.890
but nothing but prostitution.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:40.959
To see and to be seen.

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.470
Why?

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:51.190
Every woman has to dress up in such a way
that she should be attractive, for what?

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.990
Is she a prostitute?

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.120
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:08.900
For example French bath, you know what it
means, all over the world.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:15.740
It's a very dirty habit of laziness, it comes
because of drinking.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:23.108
If you drink too much, next morning you are
so lethargic that you take just a French bath

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:24.108
and go.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:27.780
So, please try to remember as French Sahaja
Yogis, that your task is much more difficult

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:36.150
than the task of other countries, because
it lacks complete wisdom.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:53.520
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government, nor in any education.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.860
It's lacking wisdom completely.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:07.510
And to have wisdom, according to these Freudian
people, is that you are egoistical!

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:20.020
They have such funny ideas from the yarn of
Mr. Freud that no sensible man would accept.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:32.370
But people have lost their senses, and like
blotting paper, whatever is filthy, destructive,

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:38.970
horrible, subhuman they try to absorb.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:43.880
Supposed to be Christian nation.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:55.530
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:
You must get hold of books and find out, where

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.940
are we?

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:11.150
I worked very hard in France, you know that
very well.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:22.500
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:42.080
But it is much worse than that, it's a mire
of filth and you are born here and you have

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:50.050
become like lotuses, so fragrant and beautiful.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:19:00.550
You'll have to fight it out: I am always with
you, all My powers with you.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:19.350
But remember that you have to fight the society,
you have to save so many people, you have

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.710
to rescue them.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:33.070
Children are given liberty, "Do what you like."

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.020
They have no sense of liberty!

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.270
Supposing there's an aeroplane, which was
not fixed properly and made to fly.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.540
What will happen to the aeroplane?

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:53.620
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty and the right

00:19:53.620 --> 00:20:01.190
sense about themselves, what will happen to
them?

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:06.860
Why children are born to parents?

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:19.160
It is - to get spoiled, to have liberty or
to get some guidance?

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.760
You cannot guide your children.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.780
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:35.230
They have gone off, completely.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:56.170
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children and we had come

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:08.250
to the point of urge of closing down that
school because they were really violent children,

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.550
as if coming from some jungle.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:18.100
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:24.430
So you've to think about your children.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:30.760
What's going to happen to your children?

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.300
What is going to be their situation?

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:57.080
If they are going to live in the same manner
in this dirt, these children will turn out

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:04.340
to be waste, just a waste!

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:21.220
They will have no education, no character,
no personality, they'll end up with AIDS or

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:28.280
with drugs or something like that.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:41.340
I do not see any future for the children of
France, no future.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:23:03.260
And you have to fight that, "We want to have
future for our children, we don't want them

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.780
to be ruined."

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.690
And you must have courage, to fight it.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:20.350
It's very important to have courage.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:31.340
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:44.549
And today's Puja is to give that courage in
your hearts.

00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:54.640
See it all around you, what's happening?

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:02.200
You are all nicely enjoying yourself in the
realm of God, (Shri Mataji smiling) you have

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.380
entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:17.270
But what about the rest of the people?

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:26.220
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:36.429
What is going to be the future of this horrible
Mooladhara place?

00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:44.320
Now Freud has been discovered as a fraudulent
man, and now there are books after so many

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:56.790
years, when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:06.300
But the worst of all they have ruined here.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:19.420
It's a responsibility specially of the women
I think, because they are responsible for

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.590
the society.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:37.769
The society of France has gone to dogs and
for you to now take up upon yourself to talk

00:25:37.769 --> 00:26:01.200
against this kind of anarchy that is working
out the destruction of your families.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:17.049
If the women decide, I am sure, they can very,
very easily work it out.

00:26:17.049 --> 00:26:28.799
Instead of asking for liberation nonsensical,
you better ask for the ascent of this country.

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:42.480
I know I've worked very hard and you are all
there.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:54.510
I am very happy to see that you all are there
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:27:14.570
Because now you should know in a very big
way, masses of masses of people will be destroyed.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:19.010
Not from without but from within.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:27.409
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions disappear
with this disease.

00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:40.150
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:
always give yourself a bandhan; always lead

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.900
a clean life.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:54.790
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.450
Do not neglect it.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:13.090
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga, whatever may be the conditions,

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:18.110
whatever may be the reason.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:28.900
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:39.390
Like the one yesterday who was arguing with
Me, actually because they have only two types

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:51.460
of people: one who are arrogant and another
one which always think that it's better they

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.409
should die.

00:28:53.409 --> 00:28:59.610
They have no will to live.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:24.660
So there are only two types of people, either
right-sided or left-sided.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.660
And they can never ascend.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:43.830
We have tried, we have tried, of course one
first one is living for the last seven years,

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.820
but still.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:51.799
He has no faith in himself.

00:29:51.799 --> 00:30:02.769
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:08.260
But as far as this generation is concerned,
you should know your responsibility is very

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.260
great.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:18.580
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow that
they'll fight this society and try to save

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.730
their country and their countrymen from a
complete disaster.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:36.940
There is going to be no war, only they will
fight themselves and die.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:43.539
It's a very serious matter.

00:30:43.539 --> 00:30:56.480
For that, we decided to have this Puja of
Durga today that all negativity should be

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.400
destroyed.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.160
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:27.809
Every part of Her body was created by a Deity,
looked after by a Deity, and is also, later

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:34.580
on, is reflected in you all.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:43.850
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image, I would say, I've made you

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:51.630
in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:32:08.360
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely - it is the Deities

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:14.380
who have brought forth all the beauty that
you had.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:30.600
They have made all this beautiful congregation,
beautiful transformation, and they have created

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:37.600
such angelic people out of you.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:33:00.710
They are always working it out, but one thing
you have to do is to have the drive.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:06.870
You had pure desire to ascend, but for what?

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.919
You want to have the light, but for what?

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:14.250
You want to become gurus, for what?

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:19.679
To save people, for their salvation.

00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:25.919
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:27.240
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.260
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.570
God knows how many there are, rakshasas and
rakshasas.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.880
And they are everywhere, even within you they
were.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.880
Now they've gone out.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.700
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga,
that's very important.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:44.700
I knew the puja would be very late, because
Kali's puja is always done in the night, after

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.700
twelve.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.700
So it had to be this way.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.370
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I, tonight, I don't know what am I to

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:55.360
do, - it all works out.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.549
It's all worked out.

00:33:58.549 --> 00:34:05.140
But you have to have deliberations and you
have to think, "What can we do to change this?"

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.140
Why not write some books, why not write some
experiences?

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.140
Get them published in French only.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.140
Let the French know what's happening outside.

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.140
Get some of the books translated - some American
books, some English books.

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.140
At least give quotations from there.

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.140
How they are unaware.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.140
First this Catholic church has to go away.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.140
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.140
They are literally frightened of us.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.140
And we have to now really show them what we
are capable of.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:24.380
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen his lady-friend as the prime minister.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.680
I mean, it's not possible in any sensible
country.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.180
It's never heard of.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:37.190
I must say, English are thousand times better.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.310
They are really very good.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:48.930
At least, as far as administration is concerned,
as far as their parliament is concerned, the

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:53.870
justice is not stupid like this, it's based
on law, not based on the mood of a magistrate.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:58.060
How you are still continuing with such stupidity
which are really even before medieval age:

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.570
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:10.230
At least you can write a book about the strange
laws of French, one title.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.562
How it has harmed.

00:35:11.562 --> 00:35:17.230
There is a very nice book "Fraudulent Freud".

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:26.770
Please read that, and see how Freud has ruined
the French, how their brains are twisted,

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:27.770
how they have twisted ideas.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.070
You are also intelligent, clever people.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:38.980
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:44.360
I never knew it was in that bad shape, though
I knew it was.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:54.650
So this is a challenge for all of us, and
let Me see what you can write, all of you

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:59.570
- put together your experience: how the French
parents behave, how the grandparents behave,

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.180
what's happening in this country and all that.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.180
They are living in fool's paradise.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.980
They don't know how destruction is just hanging
over their heads.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:17.860
Though you are all saved, but you have to
think of others, that is what Sahaja Yoga

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:22.320
is, that is not only that we care for the
bhaktas - like Kali just wanted to protect

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.660
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.340
But you have to protect many, many more people.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.230
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.230
You can do it.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:35.360
Your media is the worst of all and we can
start the newspaper also calling it anti-media.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.381
What can they do to us?

00:36:36.381 --> 00:36:37.381
Or some sort of an independent name, we can
give it.

00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:38.381
And it should be open for people who are suffering
from media sensationalization.

00:36:38.381 --> 00:36:39.440
They can write: how the media is harming them,
how they are giving false reports and things.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.440
We can!

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.440
Why not?

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.440
I am sure it will work out.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.440
Think it over what you can do with your pen.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.580
Whatever you have gained, whatever you are
enjoying: beautiful music, all the Pujas,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.580
everything.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.180
But think of others.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:56.660
They are already drunk and tossing their heads
on their pillows.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.700
Think of them.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:03.470
They, when will they feel this joy?

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:09.650
I simply feel pity for them that they should
have taken to all these bad things, because

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.290
of the suppression of the Catholic church.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.920
It's the Catholic church which has suppressed
them, that's why they have come to this.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.920
No other way - reason why they should accept
this kind of thing.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.930
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these things,
we're in the centre.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:19.930
We do not have this kind of problems, because
we don't suppress anyone, nor do we go to

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.330
the other extreme of indulgences.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:27.310
I think the whole Europe can be divided into
two types of people: one are Anglo-Saxons,

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.310
and others are Latins.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.310
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided: they cry, weep, miserable,

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.310
they indulge into dirt and filth.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.310
Just these two types they are.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.310
Now unluckily you are in the Latin side.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.310
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.310
Now, if you see to the Latin side and understand
to what extent they have gone to the left

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:58.490
side, and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely, make a list of them.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:04.553
So what I said will work out in France: the
left-sided incurable diseases.

00:38:04.553 --> 00:38:05.553
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four mad people, lunatic people

00:38:05.553 --> 00:38:06.553
walking, you'll find.

00:38:06.553 --> 00:38:07.553
Very simple it is.

00:38:07.553 --> 00:38:24.400
Don't have to go to the lunatic asylum, on
the street!

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.400
They'll be all talking and saying things,
but it's all there.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.780
That's why they drink, that's why they are
miserable.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:39:29.250
I do not know what are the statistics of the
diseases.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:40:04.780
So the problem is extremely grave, very grave.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:48.430
And you have to work it out, with the gravity
of your gurupada which you have asked Me the

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:59.483
other day - you asked for the status of a
guru, for ladies as well as for men.

00:40:59.483 --> 00:41:00.483
And I said, "All right, start!"

00:41:00.483 --> 00:41:06.236
I hope you all have heard the song I've made,
for asking.

00:41:06.236 --> 00:41:07.236
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

00:41:07.236 --> 00:41:08.236
All right once they will sing that song.

00:41:08.236 --> 00:41:09.236
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

00:41:09.236 --> 00:41:10.236
They will sing that song to you.

00:41:10.236 --> 00:41:11.236
There are different request from the Mother,
and in this the last one is that: "Mother,

00:41:11.236 --> 00:41:29.820
now you give us the gurupada, the status of
a guru."

00:41:29.820 --> 00:42:00.680
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse the
society in which he lives.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:16.860
It's his duty, he has to fight it.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:50.210
Christ fought it alone, so many saints fought
it alone, they were treated very badly, put

00:42:50.210 --> 00:43:08.970
in jail, given poisons, things, but they fought
it.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:35.290
In the same way you stand on Truth, and you
have to fight it.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:47.900
Because you are saints.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:44:08.920
May God bless you!

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:40.460

They'll repeat it twice, so you can also.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:46:47.830
I don't think all of you have heard it, because
those who came to Guru Puja must have.
