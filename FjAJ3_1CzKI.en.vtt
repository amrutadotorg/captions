00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:21.460
Thirty years back, when Sahastrara was opened,

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:26.246
I found darkness all over.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.511
People were so ignorant.

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:37.555
They had no awareness  what they have to find.

00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:47.008
Of course, I found they wanted to find something that was unknown,

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.602
but they did not know what was unknown, what they have to find.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:01:00.938
And they were extremely ignorant people, about themselves,

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:08.323
and about their surroundings, and about the aim of their life.

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:17.492
I didn’t know how to start the topic with them.

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:29.829
When the Sahastrara was opened, I thought of trying

00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:40.168
Self-realisation only on one lady: she was an old lady.

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:46.398
And there was another lady who also started to come up.

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:57.405
This old lady got her Realisation, and then the another lady who was much younger

00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:04.883
she told me that she gets fits and she gets possessed.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.982
“Oh my God!” I said, “how will I give her Realisation?”

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.790
But somehow she got cured very fast and she also got her Realisation.

00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:22.773
It’s a very unknown knowledge.

00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:28.596
Also, human beings, in their ego, do not want to accept

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.389
that they are not yet complete, that they have to have their Realisation.

00:02:36.984 --> 00:02:46.976
Also their style of life was such that they had no time for themselves.

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:57.503
I found it very difficult to convince people that you must take your Self-realisation,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.245
because they thought it is something imaginary,

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:08.706
it is very far-fetched, and they only believed in ‘gurus’

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:15.817
who would say alright, “Do this much of rituals, karmakand."

00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:17.614
That’s all!

00:03:17.724 --> 00:03:21.326
And they were doing all kinds of rituals

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:25.421
with the ‘kind’ guidance of their gurus,

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.574
without knowing that you have to first know yourself,

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:38.501
which is said by all the great incarnations, all the saints – clearly!

00:03:39.913 --> 00:03:47.199
It is not that it was only my idea that people should get their Self-realisation

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:51.549
but it was the idea of all those people.

00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:57.801
They said, one after another, for centuries, that “Seek yourself."

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:00.559
Even Christ said “Know thyself”.

00:04:00.646 --> 00:04:05.102
Mohammed Saheb said the same, Nanak Saheb said the same.

00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:10.742
But nobody tried to know that these rituals are not

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:15.364
the end of life, they will not serve the purpose,

00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:18.990
and that you have to have Realisation.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.936
So those two ladies, only, got Self-realisation,

00:04:27.198 --> 00:04:32.038
and with that I thought, “Let’s go to the seashore."

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.629
And about thirty people came with me.

00:04:39.057 --> 00:04:45.462
And they were talking in a very funny manner as to:

00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:51.311
How they can get Self-realisation?
They don’t deserve it.

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:56.707
They have not been very good people.

00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:59.770
All kinds of things: condemning themselves!

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.875
And in that lot I got about twelve people, altogether,

00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:12.259
inclusive of these two ladies who got Realisation [before].

00:05:14.994 --> 00:05:29.703
This is a sign that the movement of knowing yourself is very, very slow,

00:05:31.318 --> 00:05:37.717
and people don’t understand why they should know themselves.

00:05:38.094 --> 00:05:44.525
I was quite disappointed, because nobody understood me.

00:05:45.863 --> 00:05:50.732
But one day it so happened that, in one of the programmes,

00:05:51.137 --> 00:05:55.803
one lady came: she was possessed,

00:05:56.428 --> 00:06:00.888
and she started talking in Sanskrit language.

00:06:01.102 --> 00:06:07.271
She was just a maid-servant, and everybody was surprised

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:11.703
and she said, “You don’t know who she is!”

00:06:12.152 --> 00:06:19.705
And then she started describing me from the Saundarya Lahari.

00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:23.578
I was wondering, “What’s the matter with this lady?”

00:06:24.323 --> 00:06:27.717
Like a man she spoke. Her voice was like a man.

00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:31.098
People may believe it or not. But she was very possessed.

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:35.069
And then they started asking her.

00:06:36.122 --> 00:06:40.608
And then they came and asked me, “Mother, what she is saying – is it true?”

00:06:41.108 --> 00:06:43.673
I said, “You should find out yourself."

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:49.871
Because  those days people were such that if you tell them anything like that,

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.466
they would turn their faces.

00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:58.746
Only the kind of false gurus who would say “Alright, you give me five rupees."

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:01.680
They would be very happy that, “You can purchase the guru!

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.389
Now you don’t have to bother about anything.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:09.091
You don’t have to do anything."

00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:17.459
So, with that, gradually, it started working out.

00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:22.459
And I remember that these people who got their Realisation

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:27.552
asked me, “Mother you allow us to do Durga puja."

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:33.015
Durga puja was regarded as something, a very difficult thing.

00:07:33.464 --> 00:07:40.153
And Brahmins were normally not ready to do it,
because they were not Realised-souls,

00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:48.038
so they used to get into fits and into all kinds of problems.

00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:51.345
So they called the Brahmins, seven of them,

00:07:51.473 --> 00:07:54.417
and told them, “You just don’t worry.

00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:59.485
Nothing will happen to you, because now you are facing the Reality.

00:07:59.615 --> 00:08:03.230
It’s not some sort of a...

00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:08.118
murti  puja or anything. It’s a human being."

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.817
They were quite frightened. They came down.

00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:14.971
But something happened to them: with a great

00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:19.143
confidence they started all the mantras, everything,

00:08:19.397 --> 00:08:22.279
and the vibrations started flowing everywhere.

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:30.343
Even, we were very close to the sea, I found  the sea was roaring.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.151
But people didn’t understand.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.822
Except for these seven people, they said, “Nothing happened to us,

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.120
we dideverything so well!”

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:46.019
I think that was the first miracle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:47.544 --> 00:08:51.248
You see, the trouble with human mind at this level,

00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:57.085
or at this time, is that they have too much of self-importance,

00:08:58.052 --> 00:09:01.329
and they think no end of themselves.

00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:04.485
So already they think, “We are great!

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.889
What is there to know ourselves?
We know ourselves very well."

00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:17.483
So the basic seeking power is humility.

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:25.580
If you think you know everything, you cannot humble down, and you cannot seek.

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:31.509
Even if you seek, they don’t want to follow anybody’s path.

00:09:31.562 --> 00:09:33.067
They say, “We have our own path.

00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:35.099
We will follow our own path.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:37.729
We’ll do whatever we want to do!”

00:09:38.054 --> 00:09:43.912
And, like this, I faced many people, in different countries,

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:48.217
who just came to listen to my lecture, that’s all,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.614
but they wouldn’t take Realisation.

00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:58.903
And some of them did take their Realisation, they got it, but they got it lost.

00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:06.498
Somehow this was such a funny story for me

00:10:06.736 --> 00:10:09.839
that: I am giving them Realisation,

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:12.476
I am taking no money for it, nothing.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.262
I used to travel on my own.

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:20.166
But despite that, why is it, that the people

00:10:20.484 --> 00:10:24.261
don’t realise the value of Self-realisation?

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:31.279
Then a gentle man who got Realisation, in the first lot,

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:38.984
he told me, “Today, is a consumer society, as they call it, whatever it is."

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.670
That, “Unless and until you take money from them, they will never value it.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:49.732
Let them feel that we have paid for it, for our Realisation.

00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:52.531
So at the gate only, you should keep somebody to take money,

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:55.345
otherwise they don’t take to it."

00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:59.426
I said, “But you cannot sell it – it’s falsehood.

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:03.821
You cannot sell Self-realisation to people."

00:11:05.002 --> 00:11:08.413
He said, “Then, you see, you won’t be successful."

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:14.888
With other gurus this is main thing is that they just accept

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:18.336
the money and even they tell people, “Bring so much money!

00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:21.130
Do this much. There is a fees.

00:11:21.674 --> 00:11:28.753
And that’s how only the ego is satisfied and people take to false people.

00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:35.556
This falsehood, they may realise later on,

00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:41.534
because they suffer a lot, with all kinds of physical,  mental problems,

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:45.892
but by that time they are gone cases.

00:11:47.368 --> 00:11:53.770
Now the Sahastrara has not been yet described in any one of the books.

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:58.648
Though they have talked about it, in our ancient books, in India also.

00:11:58.907 --> 00:12:01.146
They have talked about Sahastrara

00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:06.045
but nobody has described it except that it has one thousand petals.

00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:12.252
At least if they had mentioned something about it,

00:12:12.474 --> 00:12:17.089
it would have been easier for me to show that, “See, this is written in the book."

00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:19.530
Because people are like that!

00:12:19.752 --> 00:12:25.113
It has to be written in some book and that only they accept.

00:12:25.935 --> 00:12:28.234
It’s a very difficult situation!

00:12:28.527 --> 00:12:32.237
Because nobody had given a collective Realisation,

00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:35.981
so nobody had written to that extent, except for

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:39.767
one or two people who wrote clearly about Kundalini.

00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:44.227
But I wouldn’t say it was so clear, because it was all in poetry.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:50.098
So people would sing the songs, but they would not understand.

00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:56.861
But I was thinking, “How these people who were lost,

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:03.579
here and there under some sort of a seeking, what will happen to them?

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:10.090
And how will I be able to give them Self-realisation?”

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:21.010
Experiences were so horrid, but doesn’t matter.

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:28.126
I went on and on and on, and I worked it out.

00:13:28.585 --> 00:13:36.491
Of course, we met some people who were also very cruel and nasty,

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:41.819
who troubled me and troubled Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:42.945 --> 00:13:53.694
All these things should have really dampened my enthusiasm.

00:13:54.051 --> 00:14:00.117
But on the contrary I started thinking, “Why?
Why people are like this?”

00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:10.749
Then I realised one thing: that we cannot have the whole world to get Self-realisation.

00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:15.571
This is the Last Judgment.

00:14:15.928 --> 00:14:22.968
At this time people have to decide what is the most important thing.

00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:31.293
They have to know themselves and understand what they have got.

00:14:33.495 --> 00:14:44.179
It’s not just having a big number that will help us, but really solid Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:46.622 --> 00:14:54.470
Then I found there were people who got cured of many diseases

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:58.488
but most of them got lost.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:03.343
Some of them, who were drug addicts, gave up drug-addiction.

00:15:03.931 --> 00:15:07.785
Drinking, they gave up.
Smoking they gave up.

00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:11.431
I never said a word, that, “You give up this or give up that."

00:15:11.538 --> 00:15:17.023
I knew, once the Kundalini rises, they will automatically give up.

00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:19.433
And it happened.

00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:27.380
And that’s how people became so clean, so beautiful, and started enjoying their life.

00:15:28.056 --> 00:15:30.407
But nobody would believe them.

00:15:31.454 --> 00:15:36.888
When they went round and talked to people, they said, “Oh, you have gone mad!”

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:42.059
They couldn’t believe how they have stopped drinking, how they are not smoking.

00:15:42.162 --> 00:15:45.371
They said, “We want to drink! And what is this?”

00:15:46.018 --> 00:15:53.851
So, the identification, I found, of these people were mostly

00:15:54.049 --> 00:15:59.923
with the very loose type of enjoyment.

00:16:00.702 --> 00:16:07.690
They enjoyed very loose type of things, which had nothing to do with the Spirit.

00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:12.280
Gradually, of course, it started working out.

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:24.478
But still, I must say, that we can’t expect, in this Kali Yuga,

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:31.484
to have billions and billions of people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:31.777 --> 00:16:38.452
Though it’s my desire, it’s your desire, and you want them to get their Self-realisation,

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:43.061
by which so many good things can happen.

00:16:43.273 --> 00:16:49.257
Firstly, your physical self improves.

00:16:51.207 --> 00:16:53.547
Many people have been cured.

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:56.591
Christ cured only twenty one people.

00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:04.640
But I don’t know how many thousands have been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:05.947 --> 00:17:14.543
Also there’s another very big problem with human beings:

00:17:15.487 --> 00:17:23.926
that they read all kinds of books,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.680
and they have no clear-cut idea as to what they should find,

00:17:31.095 --> 00:17:32.976
what is their seeking.

00:17:34.957 --> 00:17:37.356
It’s a very big problem.

00:17:37.627 --> 00:17:41.037
And whatever is in one book, they’ll try to follow that.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.655
I mean they are  shifting type of people.

00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:48.454
They shift from one to another

00:17:49.011 --> 00:17:56.460
and then progress in Sahaja Yoga is much more difficult, very difficult,

00:17:56.817 --> 00:17:59.544
because if you are going on one path

00:17:59.655 --> 00:18:05.025
and you start shifting from one to another, you may go back.

00:18:05.287 --> 00:18:08.904
But in that they find it is their ‘freedom’.

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:14.417
Actually without Realisation you don’t have your freedom, of anything.

00:18:14.841 --> 00:18:24.581
Freedom is that in which you know what you are,
you know what you are capable of.

00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:30.268
In the freedom you are the one who should receive all the blessings.

00:18:30.879 --> 00:18:34.857
If these blessings are not there then you are not free.

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:43.343
There’s something wrong, somewhere, in your own life.

00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:50.086
Because once you get your Realisation you become absolutely free people.

00:18:51.042 --> 00:18:56.793
‘Free’ means, your own Spirit guides you.

00:18:57.163 --> 00:19:05.446
The Spirit, as you know, is the reflection of the Divine, the God Almighty.

00:19:05.908 --> 00:19:11.446
If everybody has the same reflection and He’s awakened,

00:19:11.835 --> 00:19:18.833
then in the awareness it works.
As if they know what is right and what is wrong,

00:19:18.945 --> 00:19:22.815
what is constructive and what is destructive.

00:19:23.841 --> 00:19:28.433
It is not some sort of a false satisfaction that you have,

00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:33.546
but in reality, you feel the Reality.

00:19:33.891 --> 00:19:37.311
And that is what it has to happen.

00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:41.837
The first thing, in Sahaja Yoga, is that you get the experience,

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:48.674
experience of feeling the spanda, the cool breeze, on your finger tips.

00:19:49.036 --> 00:19:52.556
Without the experience you should not believe anything.

00:19:52.739 --> 00:20:00.384
That means a new dimension has come now, in your nerves,

00:20:01.011 --> 00:20:09.401
that you can feel the system

00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:15.352
which has been not known to you.

00:20:15.493 --> 00:20:23.918
Sympathetic nervous system was there but you never knew how it is working.

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:28.576
The knowledge about yourself was so poor.

00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:34.177
But after Realisation suddenly the whole thing got enlightened.

00:20:34.555 --> 00:20:40.001
Suddenly you started feeling it, the newness, among yourselves.

00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:43.943
Still sometimes you haveto fight your ego,

00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:47.791
you have to get over your ignorance of things.

00:20:48.352 --> 00:20:52.061
Because Realisation gives you Absolute Knowledge,

00:20:52.854 --> 00:20:56.658
Absolute Knowledge. It cannot be challenged.

00:20:58.269 --> 00:21:03.556
It’s single: as they call it – ‘Ekameva Satya’, (the only Truth).

00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:11.254
And when you get that knowledge then you can tally it also.

00:21:11.548 --> 00:21:16.045
You can find out if it is correct or not.

00:21:17.264 --> 00:21:21.912
This is something that has happened to all of you,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:28.915
and you have already got those vibrations with which you can feel it.

00:21:29.782 --> 00:21:37.282
For example, there may be some dissatisfied souls with Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:45.919
But you can find out, on vibrations, who are these people and what are they doing.

00:21:46.188 --> 00:21:54.282
On vibrations you can make out if those people have reached
that state of Reality or not.

00:21:54.709 --> 00:22:00.423
You can make out if these people, who are

00:22:01.034 --> 00:22:07.242
trying to oppose you, or trying to tell you something else –
“How far are they?”

00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:11.032
On your fingertips you know.

00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:17.111
This is what is Qiyamah about which Mohammed Saheb has said.

00:22:17.505 --> 00:22:22.263
The other day I must tell you, an experience we had: There was one fellow

00:22:22.453 --> 00:22:28.910
who came from the television  known as ‘Star’.

00:22:29.535 --> 00:22:35.935
And he started asking me very funny questions, which had no relevance.

00:22:36.651 --> 00:22:39.765
His name was ‘Abbas’, so I said, “Abbas bhaiya,

00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:44.631
you are wasting your time and my time.
Will you come to the right questions!”

00:22:45.988 --> 00:22:50.036
So he said, “I am against all fundamentalism."

00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:52.010
“But I am not fundamentalist.

00:22:52.674 --> 00:22:56.392
How do you know I am that or not?”

00:22:57.533 --> 00:23:00.383
So he said, “I am trying to find out!”

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.870
“Alright,” I said, “you put your hands towards me.

00:23:04.152 --> 00:23:09.091
Mohammed Saheb has said that ‘At the time of, Qiyamah your hands will speak’."

00:23:09.397 --> 00:23:14.330
And, you will be amazed, immediately he started feeling cool breeze on his hands.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.942
He said, “What’s happening to me?”
I said, “That’s what it is!”

00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:26.412
No use arguing, no use talking about it,

00:23:26.585 --> 00:23:29.380
no use enquiring.

00:23:29.516 --> 00:23:31.930
Just see yourself the experience of it.

00:23:32.121 --> 00:23:40.446
He just got so stunned and after that whatever he talked to me, he never published it.

00:23:41.288 --> 00:23:46.111
So what I am saying  that if the people reach the Truth

00:23:46.505 --> 00:23:51.610
and they know this is the Truth, nothing can change them.

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:54.517
If they have reached the Truth, I am saying.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:24:00.690
You can see in the life of all the great people that they think “This is the Truth”.

00:24:00.863 --> 00:24:09.303
Not by just reading, not by just believing but as an experience,

00:24:09.723 --> 00:24:14.594
that, on their central nervous system they can feel the Truth.

00:24:14.971 --> 00:24:20.155
Then it is impossible to change them.

00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:27.345
Like you can see a seed becomes a tree, then you cannot make the tree into a seed.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:33.193
Seed is a seed, but when the seed changes into the tree

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:36.484
then you cannot bring it back to the seed.

00:24:36.832 --> 00:24:39.692
It may create more seeds, that’s different.

00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:44.453
so, in the same way, once you have got your Realisation,

00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:47.699
and once you have become one with the Divine,

00:24:48.072 --> 00:24:52.912
then there is no question of you going down, unless and until you,

00:24:53.005 --> 00:24:55.055
yourself, want to go down.

00:24:56.861 --> 00:25:01.957
It’s very very remarkable, how you get this property,

00:25:02.108 --> 00:25:06.817
how you get this ability and this capability,

00:25:06.975 --> 00:25:10.462
and after that you don’t lose it!

00:25:10.768 --> 00:25:16.308
Of course, first you must grow, and for that you have to meditate.

00:25:16.946 --> 00:25:22.844
But this meditation, once you do it, the whole

00:25:23.074 --> 00:25:30.009
being itself gets so enlightened and so beautiful that you don’t want to change it.

00:25:30.215 --> 00:25:33.815
You want to be there and enjoy it forever.

00:25:34.211 --> 00:25:37.073
But of course you want to give it to others

00:25:37.216 --> 00:25:40.067
because you see  you are enjoying so much.

00:25:40.157 --> 00:25:43.072
Like, on the street, you find somebody

00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:47.422
starving and you are very full, then you feel like giving food to that person.

00:25:47.581 --> 00:25:52.753
In the same way, you see in this world, people are madly seeking, running up and down,

00:25:52.852 --> 00:25:55.843
doing all kinds of things, so you want to tell them.

00:25:55.922 --> 00:25:58.123
They may or may not believe.

00:25:58.249 --> 00:26:08.269
They may try to absolutely deny you, defy you.

00:26:08.443 --> 00:26:10.263
They can do anything.

00:26:10.327 --> 00:26:15.802
But you know for definite that you are on the right path, you are on the

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:21.855
right state of mind which is a Sahaja state.

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:27.330
In Sanskrit it is called ‘sahaja avastha’, ‘sahajavastha’.

00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:33.040
In sahajavastha you do not react, you do not react.

00:26:33.435 --> 00:26:35.015
You just see and appreciate.

00:26:35.164 --> 00:26:40.069
Now see: I came, I saw this beautiful, such an idea of Sahastrara,

00:26:40.156 --> 00:26:45.778
all the chakras, they have crossed over, gone up there and from there they have.

00:26:45.922 --> 00:26:48.182
Very good expression.

00:26:49.698 --> 00:26:56.278
But any other person would say, “Oh, this colour combination is not good!”

00:26:58.117 --> 00:27:00.000
“Why did they use this?

00:27:00.222 --> 00:27:02.273
Why don’t they use something else?”

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:06.214
Like that, you see, finding faults with others!

00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:14.626
And this finding faults actually comes from your brain which is not yet enlightened.

00:27:14.745 --> 00:27:18.480
You cannot enjoy anything because you react.

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:20.489
All the time you go on reacting.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.533
If somebody says something nice, still you are reacting.

00:27:24.787 --> 00:27:29.069
If someone says something bad, of course you are reacting!

00:27:29.404 --> 00:27:30.874
No question!

00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:40.373
So for us to understand that
we are not free to react, we are not that cheap to react.

00:27:42.858 --> 00:27:46.049
We are on a very high pedestal.

00:27:46.187 --> 00:27:49.471
What is our job Is to enjoy?

00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:52.061
Enjoy everything.

00:27:52.656 --> 00:27:59.554
And that enjoyment is the blessing of the Divine.

00:28:00.568 --> 00:28:06.109
Even you can enjoy the turmoil and the torture.

00:28:06.427 --> 00:28:10.529
Everything you can enjoy if you see the point that:

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:15.717
nothing can happen to your Spirit, which is the real light.

00:28:16.004 --> 00:28:23.112
Whatever you may suffer, whatever you may think is troubling you –

00:28:23.271 --> 00:28:28.757
actually this silent light of the Spirit

00:28:28.804 --> 00:28:36.942
makes you absolutely, perfectly joyous and you give joy to others.

00:28:37.474 --> 00:28:40.925
You don’t design it, you don’t plan it,

00:28:41.036 --> 00:28:44.859
how to give joy, but you just automatically give joy.

00:28:45.628 --> 00:28:54.073
And this giving joy is also effortless, sahaj, because you are in the sahaja state.

00:28:54.403 --> 00:29:02.983
In the sahaja state you just see things.

00:29:04.133 --> 00:29:06.421
It’s a drama, you feel.

00:29:06.564 --> 00:29:12.799
It’s a different styles, different types and you just see and watch,

00:29:13.254 --> 00:29:17.632
and get the joy out of it.

00:29:18.704 --> 00:29:23.524
It is not important to say, “I like this, I like that." No!

00:29:24.993 --> 00:29:29.463
That ‘I’, which likes, is nothing but ego,

00:29:29.622 --> 00:29:38.127
and keeps you out of the enjoyment which is reality, which is real.

00:29:38.292 --> 00:29:45.448
Every thing in this world, that you find is troublesome,

00:29:45.691 --> 00:29:53.761
if you see  from another angle, from a sahajasthiti,
you won’t feel the troubles.

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:58.118
But that higher life should be there.

00:29:58.323 --> 00:30:02.858
That higher standard should be built-in within you.

00:30:03.628 --> 00:30:08.350
The other day I had a meeting with the bureaucrats

00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:11.882
and I told them, “I know that the pay is less.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:18.095
You may think that the others get much more pay, they are having much more facilities.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.018
But there is one way you can really enjoy your work:

00:30:23.193 --> 00:30:26.946
if you have patriotism, deshabhakti."

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:34.050
If you have patriotism for your country, no amount of sacrifice

00:30:34.715 --> 00:30:38.344
will satisfy you. You’ll want to give everything.

00:30:38.552 --> 00:30:45.508
And you can go through all kinds of so-called dearth and depressive states

00:30:45.714 --> 00:30:48.744
without even feeling anything about it.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:54.827
And, at the same time, your feelings become very deep.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:03.651
For example, you are travelling and suddenly you find somebody who is sick:

00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:08.635
you can feel it on your vibrations that this person is sick;

00:31:08.822 --> 00:31:14.147
and immediately your sympathy and your love flows to that person.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.949
You will try to help that person.

00:31:16.288 --> 00:31:19.846
If possible you will try to even cure that person.

00:31:20.168 --> 00:31:25.115
Just like that, your whole being becomes like an ocean

00:31:25.219 --> 00:31:29.617
which absorbs all the rivers and

00:31:29.731 --> 00:31:37.823
all kinds of watery things, whatever it is, within its abdomen, I should say.

00:31:38.077 --> 00:31:44.660
It just takes all that is there,

00:31:44.851 --> 00:31:48.956
but it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t trouble him.

00:31:49.468 --> 00:31:54.881
He is like over-powering person, with his love.

00:31:55.335 --> 00:31:57.155
He doesn’t show his power.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.364
He does not bother about his self-importance.

00:32:00.483 --> 00:32:05.724
If somebody tries to insult you, “Alright."

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:09.422
What is there there, the insult part of it?

00:32:09.591 --> 00:32:13.587
And such people who have reached that sahajavastha

00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:18.357
are the greatest creators of art, of music,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:24.150
of great thoughts and that’s why these survive.

00:32:24.301 --> 00:32:28.980
So many people write, but it goes out.

00:32:29.093 --> 00:32:33.026
So many people create, but nobody bothers.

00:32:33.303 --> 00:32:38.404
But those who are Realised-souls, whatever they create, is of eternal nature.

00:32:38.697 --> 00:32:43.322
Because they are now in the Ocean of Eternity.

00:32:43.822 --> 00:32:48.515
They are in the ocean of purity,

00:32:48.673 --> 00:32:56.092
where there is no idea at all, of hurting anyone or troubling anyone.

00:32:57.306 --> 00:32:59.706
Such a protection is there for them.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.996
They cannot be harmed!

00:33:03.242 --> 00:33:07.525
Because after all you have entered into the kingdom of God,

00:33:07.843 --> 00:33:11.951
so who can dare harm you or trouble you?

00:33:12.443 --> 00:33:22.260
Such a prosperity I have seen among Sahaja Yogis,
and such a generosity that they have,

00:33:22.752 --> 00:33:26.052
and such understanding about things.

00:33:26.322 --> 00:33:31.140
I don’t have to give lectures, “Now don’t do this and don’t do that!”

00:33:31.205 --> 00:33:32.915
No, no more.

00:33:34.343 --> 00:33:45.429
And those who are not yet already matured in Sahaja Yoga should try to mature.

00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:51.737
And those who are not matured and troubling, don’t worry about them.

00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:53.962
You should have pity.

00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:58.927
You should really have pity for such people that they are so immature.

00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:04.631
Today it is something great, I feel, because thirty years I have been

00:34:04.774 --> 00:34:11.471
running up and down everywhere and I have been able to gather so many people.

00:34:11.868 --> 00:34:17.699
There are so many Sahaja Yogis, you see, and also, all over the world.

00:34:18.096 --> 00:34:20.490
This is just a wee-bit of that.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:27.051
So this is something  was to happen, has been already described,

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:32.392
has been prophesised by people that such and such thing will be happen,

00:34:32.646 --> 00:34:36.910
that so many people will get their Self-realisation.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:42.077
Unbelievable it was, of course, but, as now you see,

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:47.847
how sweet is the feeling that we are all one.

00:34:48.242 --> 00:34:55.175
There’s no quarrel, no fight, no bad ideas, and nobody likes cheap things.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:04.906
They want to have something that is pleasing and has a quality of understanding.

00:35:06.816 --> 00:35:11.306
And I have seen people becoming poets, writing beautiful poetry.

00:35:11.687 --> 00:35:14.515
I have seen people becoming orators.

00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:21.777
Also I have seen people becoming very good organisers.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:28.410
But one thing is very important, is the humility.

00:35:28.831 --> 00:35:35.315
I said in the beginning and again I would say: what will appeal to people is your humility.

00:35:35.918 --> 00:35:41.863
You should be a humble person, not think that you are something special,

00:35:42.053 --> 00:35:54.618
or not think that you are some sort of a self-important person.

00:35:55.257 --> 00:36:01.627
Once you think that you are important then you are not part and parcel of the whole.

00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:07.817
If my one hand starts thinking, “I am important,” it’s stupid.

00:36:08.111 --> 00:36:10.146
How can one hand be important?

00:36:10.336 --> 00:36:12.386
All hands are needed.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.348
Everything is needed.

00:36:14.446 --> 00:36:15.906
Legs are needed.

00:36:16.012 --> 00:36:18.803
How can one part be so important?

00:36:19.036 --> 00:36:25.089
If you start thinking like that anywhere in your journey of Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.294
then I must say, you are not in the sahajavastha.

00:36:28.493 --> 00:36:37.522
So my own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja,

00:36:37.985 --> 00:36:43.207
where you will be absolutely one with your Self,

00:36:43.295 --> 00:36:47.670
one with the nature, one with all the people

00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:52.943
who are around you, with your own country, and countries.

00:36:53.276 --> 00:36:58.791
Everywhere, the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmanda (universe)

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.350
becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:15.041
Then the echoes – they call ‘ninaad’

00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:21.514
the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen.

00:37:21.935 --> 00:37:28.006
Not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing

00:37:28.196 --> 00:37:33.701
but in the spiritual area, which is the highest.

00:37:34.764 --> 00:37:40.074
Everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality

00:37:40.241 --> 00:37:43.822
and, till today, they are all remembered.

00:37:44.013 --> 00:37:52.347
In the same way you all will be representing a very great knowledge

00:37:52.551 --> 00:37:59.596
about Reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working.

00:37:59.716 --> 00:38:04.786
In every way you can do anything.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.393
Now, only thing that, now, we have to do is to decide:

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:12.634
how many people we are going to give Realisation?

00:38:12.951 --> 00:38:14.861
What we can do for Realisation?

00:38:15.492 --> 00:38:17.068
What should we do?

00:38:17.314 --> 00:38:23.256
This is the only thing, if you go on with your

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:35.838
complete emancipation, you will be surprised, it’s like climbing up a big mountain.

00:38:36.934 --> 00:38:40.793
But when you have reached to the peak, you can see everything very well,

00:38:40.912 --> 00:38:44.272
and you feel so satisfied that you are at the peak.

00:38:44.882 --> 00:38:50.041
So, that climbing part, even  some of you have to do it,

00:38:50.279 --> 00:38:54.011
it is alright, there’s no problem, you can do it.

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:57.746
You must have respect for yourself, love yourself,

00:38:57.812 --> 00:39:02.771
and  understanding that you have to reach the peak, peak of the mountain.

00:39:02.883 --> 00:39:06.756
And once you have reached the peak of the mountain you will know you are there.

00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:11.159
And then you start showering all your love,

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:15.775
affection, and everything, that flows down the mountain.

00:39:15.869 --> 00:39:17.859
That is the life for you.

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:20.737
It’s the greatest type of life.

00:39:20.846 --> 00:39:27.205
Forget all other people: politicians and all other people who were supposed to be great.

00:39:27.287 --> 00:39:28.517
Forget them!

00:39:28.604 --> 00:39:31.021
You are much higher than that,

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:41.298
because you are already chiselled like a diamond with the Sahaj style of life;

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:49.929
which is very satisfying and also which is very much absolutely peace giving.

00:39:50.195 --> 00:39:53.625
It gives you joy, it gives you peace,

00:39:53.747 --> 00:39:58.900
it gives you capabilities, it gives you so many things that you cannot count,

00:39:59.194 --> 00:40:03.914
like the thousand petals of your Sahastrara which are enlightened.

00:40:04.032 --> 00:40:07.942
God knows what all you can have with this!

00:40:08.203 --> 00:40:14.281
This is such a tremendous area you are in – the thousand petals.

00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:18.970
And from there, people have gained all the knowledge about science,

00:40:19.065 --> 00:40:23.146
knowledge about all the great discoveries are from there.

00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:28.892
So this is what one has to realise one’s own esteem.

00:40:29.044 --> 00:40:35.016
Self-esteem is different form self-importance.

00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:37.491
You should have self-esteem.

00:40:37.645 --> 00:40:40.020
With that you will become humble.

00:40:41.166 --> 00:40:46.235
You will become very loving because you are capable of love.

00:40:46.558 --> 00:40:49.277
And it is not forced on you.

00:40:49.771 --> 00:40:56.040
I agree that from the ocean the clouds rise

00:40:56.255 --> 00:40:58.392
and then they give rain and all that,

00:40:58.494 --> 00:41:02.509
but it is in the cycle of life  they are doing it.

00:41:02.777 --> 00:41:06.258
They are not conscious of it.

00:41:06.601 --> 00:41:11.461
They don’t think that they are doing something great because they are in the cycle.

00:41:11.657 --> 00:41:15.285
You are out of the cycle and still you are doing

00:41:15.571 --> 00:41:21.417
work without any feeling of self-importance.

00:41:22.131 --> 00:41:24.920
You are doing because you have to do it!

00:41:25.122 --> 00:41:31.633
Another cycle, not the natural cycle, but another cycle of awareness,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.723
where you are aware as to what you are doing.

00:41:34.858 --> 00:41:41.127
At the same time you are very humble, you are very loving, you are very kind.

00:41:41.967 --> 00:41:45.208
You don’t shout, you don’t beat anyone.

00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:48.571
You don’t say anything harsh to anyone.

00:41:48.649 --> 00:41:53.106
And you can manage the most difficult person.

00:41:53.246 --> 00:41:57.368
If someone tries to be funny, you can always raise the Kundalini

00:41:57.559 --> 00:41:59.755
and be satisfied with it.

00:41:59.898 --> 00:42:05.268
If you secretly raise the Kundalini, the other person is finished!

00:42:05.498 --> 00:42:08.410
If you cannot raise it, then forget it!

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.201
Forget it! He is a difficult person, you know, it’s a stone.

00:42:12.352 --> 00:42:14.609
Now in the stone, what can you do?

00:42:14.715 --> 00:42:24.879
You cannot make it flow, the love and the dignity, all these qualities.

00:42:25.078 --> 00:42:30.528
It is not possible from a stone-hearted person, so forget it, that’s not your job.

00:42:30.975 --> 00:42:32.746
That’s not your job at all.

00:42:32.858 --> 00:42:39.680
So, I would request that, first of all, you should see that: how much humble we are.

00:42:40.023 --> 00:42:47.183
You have to be very humble and that is your decoration, that is your beauty.

00:42:47.626 --> 00:42:54.879
So you have your love, which is pure, without any lust or greed.

00:42:55.071 --> 00:43:01.193
You love others only because you are in love.

00:43:01.903 --> 00:43:06.982
And then, secondly, you are blessed with peace,

00:43:07.149 --> 00:43:11.212
you are absolutely at peace with yourself.

00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:15.155
And you will be amazed – with peace, wisdom will come to you.

00:43:15.583 --> 00:43:19.978
You will be regarded as the wisest man, wisest woman,

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.783
because you are at peace with yourself.

00:43:22.985 --> 00:43:27.623
Only in peace you can discover the Truth,

00:43:27.766 --> 00:43:32.060
you can discover every solution that you want to.

00:43:32.964 --> 00:43:40.783
You become  very wise and sensible person – outstandingly great than others.

00:43:41.135 --> 00:43:44.137
You are not like common, general, people.

00:43:44.674 --> 00:43:48.341
Then you have joy.

00:43:48.497 --> 00:43:54.315
Joy is something I cannot express in words but still

00:43:54.415 --> 00:43:58.657
joy, as I have told you many a times, it is singular.

00:43:58.823 --> 00:44:02.936
It is not happiness or unhappiness, it is just joy.

00:44:03.167 --> 00:44:04.924
Just you enjoy.

00:44:05.259 --> 00:44:12.201
You enjoy everything, enjoy every company, every incident,

00:44:12.312 --> 00:44:16.673
every scene, every happening in your life.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.254
You know how to enjoy everything.

00:44:20.193 --> 00:44:23.410
You see, just joy has a great capacity.

00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:28.331
Once, I remember I had gone with my son-in-law and daughter

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.624
to see some historical place and we had to climb a lot.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:37.997
We were climbing for about three hours, so, naturally, we all got tired

00:44:38.274 --> 00:44:42.710
and there was a little resting place, made of marble,

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:46.536
so we said, “Let us spread out ourselves here!”

00:44:46.821 --> 00:44:50.241
So when I spread it out, they were so much

00:44:50.368 --> 00:44:55.641
saying, “Why should we have come here, of all the things"
All that they were grudging.

00:44:55.799 --> 00:45:03.195
Then suddenly, you know – this is the joy point –
suddenly I saw the carvings of elephants.

00:45:03.525 --> 00:45:06.177
So I said, “Can you see these elephants?

00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:10.277
Everybody’s tail is differently made!”

00:45:11.348 --> 00:45:16.370
They said, “Mummy, how could you see the elephants’ tails?

00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:18.802
We are so tired!”

00:45:18.881 --> 00:45:21.463
I said, “You also see! Just see that."

00:45:21.633 --> 00:45:28.663
Because this joy, it shifts, shifts your mind from nonsense.

00:45:29.217 --> 00:45:31.563
You just say, “It’s all nonsense."

00:45:31.619 --> 00:45:33.421
You just shift your mind.

00:45:33.484 --> 00:45:35.280
This is the way you get joy!

00:45:35.351 --> 00:45:38.076
And goes to the thing that will  joy giving.

00:45:38.155 --> 00:45:42.083
Supposing there is a person who is quite boring,

00:45:42.202 --> 00:45:46.386
you know, then what happens, you just see the

00:45:46.553 --> 00:45:52.029
humour behind boring: how a person bores you!

00:45:54.161 --> 00:46:03.581
And what you learn out of it is – never bore anyone.

00:46:05.779 --> 00:46:15.956
So this joy has a speciality, that it teaches you the essence of joy of everything.

00:46:16.316 --> 00:46:24.616
If it is a bad film, still you enjoy because you see how bad it is.

00:46:25.183 --> 00:46:29.918
Supposing, of course if it is a good film, then you can always see them!

00:46:30.378 --> 00:46:36.407
But you do not go with a mind, how to criticise.

00:46:36.684 --> 00:46:40.224
This criticism business goes out of your mind.

00:46:40.326 --> 00:46:44.435
So what happens  your mind shifts immediately

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:50.007
from something that is ridiculous to something interesting in the same thing.

00:46:50.339 --> 00:46:55.318
So you don’t criticise and you don’t feel bad about it.

00:46:55.702 --> 00:47:03.882
Sometimes it so happens that people are amazed that how I tolerate such people.

00:47:04.191 --> 00:47:09.331
But I don’t tolerate, I am not paying any attention, whatever the person may be doing.

00:47:09.545 --> 00:47:16.563
If you are of that nature, that we can call as a condition

00:47:16.821 --> 00:47:22.761
where you are absolutely in the Turya state:

00:47:22.992 --> 00:47:26.476
so Kabira has said, “Jab mast hue, fir kya bole?”

00:47:26.603 --> 00:47:31.521
When I have gone into that state of joy, why should I say anything?

00:47:32.197 --> 00:47:39.258
It is like that: a temperament which you have to understand, and respect it.

00:47:39.427 --> 00:47:41.627
That is within you, but respect it.

00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:46.148
Do not compare it with others, others are not at your level.

00:47:46.257 --> 00:47:50.486
So you are at a different level and you just try to enjoy.

00:47:50.691 --> 00:47:55.078
Never feel that you are something higher or greater – no, never feel .

00:47:55.259 --> 00:48:02.579
What you should feel  that thankfulness that you are not mixed up with

00:48:02.962 --> 00:48:08.594
all those funny ideas and funny style of life

00:48:08.674 --> 00:48:11.509
where you go on criticising – “This is not good!
I don’t like it!

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.021
I don’t like it!”

00:48:14.563 --> 00:48:17.038
Who are you?You don’t know yourself.

00:48:17.149 --> 00:48:20.289
When you say, “I don’t like it,” you are not knowing yourself.

00:48:20.614 --> 00:48:23.886
How do you know what you don’t like?

00:48:24.085 --> 00:48:29.666
I have seen people with very poor knowledge,

00:48:29.983 --> 00:48:36.901
who are just knowing  little bit here and there, are very critical of others.

00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:39.761
I don’t know the reason, why it is so.

00:48:39.854 --> 00:48:43.024
But maybe that they think no end of themselves!

00:48:43.835 --> 00:48:46.324
But this is what is very common.

00:48:46.538 --> 00:48:52.482
But if you know the Absolute Knowledge, then you become really humble;

00:48:52.649 --> 00:48:58.939
absolutely humble and sweet, gentle and kind.

00:48:59.954 --> 00:49:05.137
So today is a great day otherwise, for me also: I didn’t know

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:09.673
that I will survive so many years to see this beautiful day.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:16.640
Because after all, it was very hard life, according to others’ standards.

00:49:16.918 --> 00:49:24.723
But what is most joy giving to me was creating Sahaja Yogis,

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:29.331
and listening to them and talking to them,

00:49:29.617 --> 00:49:35.842
the way they were so sweet and so kind and so respectful!

00:49:36.254 --> 00:49:41.125
All this has helped me so much and I must thank you for that.

00:49:41.355 --> 00:49:48.394
With your support, with your help, with your understanding, I could achieve it.

00:49:48.822 --> 00:49:55.792
If I could have achieve it on my own, I would never have asked for this help of yours.

00:49:56.003 --> 00:50:00.674
But you are just like my hands, you are just like my eyes.

00:50:00.778 --> 00:50:04.685
And I need you very much because, without you I cannot do it.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:08.381
It’s like channelising: unless and until you have channels,

00:50:08.524 --> 00:50:11.687
what’s the use of being Adi Shakti or anything?

00:50:11.722 --> 00:50:13.417
How will you channelise it?

00:50:13.861 --> 00:50:22.462
If there is electrical movement, you need channels, otherwise its a static thing.

00:50:22.847 --> 00:50:28.518
In the same way I felt, always, that I needed more and more channels,

00:50:28.637 --> 00:50:34.349
and when it worked out, I was really, really in a very great Spirit.

00:50:34.543 --> 00:50:40.076
So I thank you very much, again, for this day that has come.

00:50:40.338 --> 00:50:45.478
And I bless you from my heart that – now you take over responsibility.

00:50:45.676 --> 00:50:50.320
You are a Sahaja Yogi, so you have a responsibility, also,

00:50:50.399 --> 00:50:53.829
to give Realisation to others. Don’t keep to yourself.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.197
This has to be given to others.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.552
And you can explain, you can talk to them,

00:50:59.664 --> 00:51:02.354
you can really, very well, understand them.

00:51:02.554 --> 00:51:07.174
Try to understand them and talk to them.

00:51:07.331 --> 00:51:13.016
And you must give Realisation to others, otherwise you won’t feel complete.

00:51:13.343 --> 00:51:15.993
To feel complete, you have to do that.

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:18.115
May God bless you all.
