00:06.084 --> 00:21.460
Thirty years back, when Sahastrara was opened,

00:22.135 --> 00:26.246
I found darkness all over.

00:26.530 --> 00:30.511
People were so ignorant.

00:30.749 --> 00:37.555
They had no awareness  what they have to find.

00:37.757 --> 00:47.008
Of course, I found they wanted to find something that was unknown,

00:47.199 --> 00:53.602
but they did not know what was unknown, what they have to find.

00:54.387 --> 01:00.938
And they were extremely ignorant people, about themselves,

01:01.154 --> 01:08.323
and about their surroundings, and about the aim of their life.

01:08.881 --> 01:17.492
I didn’t know how to start the topic with them.

01:18.393 --> 01:29.829
When the Sahastrara was opened, I thought of trying

01:30.702 --> 01:40.168
Self-realisation only on one lady: she was an old lady.

01:40.398 --> 01:46.398
And there was another lady who also started to come up.

01:47.263 --> 01:57.405
This old lady got her Realisation, and then the another lady who was much younger

01:58.232 --> 02:04.883
she told me that she gets fits and she gets possessed.

02:05.090 --> 02:09.982
“Oh my God!” I said, “how will I give her Realisation?”

02:10.400 --> 02:18.790
But somehow she got cured very fast and she also got her Realisation.

02:19.695 --> 02:22.773
It’s a very unknown knowledge.

02:23.265 --> 02:28.596
Also, human beings, in their ego, do not want to accept

02:28.960 --> 02:36.389
that they are not yet complete, that they have to have their Realisation.

02:36.984 --> 02:46.976
Also their style of life was such that they had no time for themselves.

02:48.547 --> 02:57.503
I found it very difficult to convince people that you must take your Self-realisation,

02:58.250 --> 03:03.245
because they thought it is something imaginary,

03:03.365 --> 03:08.706
it is very far-fetched, and they only believed in ‘gurus’

03:08.872 --> 03:15.817
who would say alright, “Do this much of rituals, karmakand."

03:15.964 --> 03:17.614
That’s all!

03:17.724 --> 03:21.326
And they were doing all kinds of rituals

03:21.509 --> 03:25.421
with the ‘kind’ guidance of their gurus,

03:25.909 --> 03:30.574
without knowing that you have to first know yourself,

03:30.756 --> 03:38.501
which is said by all the great incarnations, all the saints – clearly!

03:39.913 --> 03:47.199
It is not that it was only my idea that people should get their Self-realisation

03:47.465 --> 03:51.549
but it was the idea of all those people.

03:52.062 --> 03:57.801
They said, one after another, for centuries, that “Seek yourself."

03:58.317 --> 04:00.559
Even Christ said “Know thyself”.

04:00.646 --> 04:05.102
Mohammed Saheb said the same, Nanak Saheb said the same.

04:05.205 --> 04:10.742
But nobody tried to know that these rituals are not

04:10.902 --> 04:15.364
the end of life, they will not serve the purpose,

04:15.571 --> 04:18.990
and that you have to have Realisation.

04:22.550 --> 04:26.936
So those two ladies, only, got Self-realisation,

04:27.198 --> 04:32.038
and with that I thought, “Let’s go to the seashore."

04:32.530 --> 04:37.629
And about thirty people came with me.

04:39.057 --> 04:45.462
And they were talking in a very funny manner as to:

04:45.645 --> 04:51.311
How they can get Self-realisation?
They don’t deserve it.

04:51.497 --> 04:56.707
They have not been very good people.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.770
All kinds of things: condemning themselves!

05:00.849 --> 05:05.875
And in that lot I got about twelve people, altogether,

05:06.321 --> 05:12.259
inclusive of these two ladies who got Realisation [before].

05:14.994 --> 05:29.703
This is a sign that the movement of knowing yourself is very, very slow,

05:31.318 --> 05:37.717
and people don’t understand why they should know themselves.

05:38.094 --> 05:44.525
I was quite disappointed, because nobody understood me.

05:45.863 --> 05:50.732
But one day it so happened that, in one of the programmes,

05:51.137 --> 05:55.803
one lady came: she was possessed,

05:56.428 --> 06:00.888
and she started talking in Sanskrit language.

06:01.102 --> 06:07.271
She was just a maid-servant, and everybody was surprised

06:07.638 --> 06:11.703
and she said, “You don’t know who she is!”

06:12.152 --> 06:19.705
And then she started describing me from the Saundarya Lahari.

06:20.068 --> 06:23.578
I was wondering, “What’s the matter with this lady?”

06:24.323 --> 06:27.717
Like a man she spoke. Her voice was like a man.

06:27.953 --> 06:31.098
People may believe it or not. But she was very possessed.

06:31.281 --> 06:35.069
And then they started asking her.

06:36.122 --> 06:40.608
And then they came and asked me, “Mother, what she is saying – is it true?”

06:41.108 --> 06:43.673
I said, “You should find out yourself."

06:43.837 --> 06:49.871
Because  those days people were such that if you tell them anything like that,

06:50.042 --> 06:52.466
they would turn their faces.

06:52.596 --> 06:58.746
Only the kind of false gurus who would say “Alright, you give me five rupees."

06:59.071 --> 07:01.680
They would be very happy that, “You can purchase the guru!

07:01.680 --> 07:04.389
Now you don’t have to bother about anything.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.091
You don’t have to do anything."

07:11.005 --> 07:17.459
So, with that, gradually, it started working out.

07:17.686 --> 07:22.459
And I remember that these people who got their Realisation

07:23.125 --> 07:27.552
asked me, “Mother you allow us to do Durga puja."

07:27.989 --> 07:33.015
Durga puja was regarded as something, a very difficult thing.

07:33.464 --> 07:40.153
And Brahmins were normally not ready to do it,
because they were not Realised-souls,

07:40.336 --> 07:48.038
so they used to get into fits and into all kinds of problems.

07:48.231 --> 07:51.345
So they called the Brahmins, seven of them,

07:51.473 --> 07:54.417
and told them, “You just don’t worry.

07:54.586 --> 07:59.485
Nothing will happen to you, because now you are facing the Reality.

07:59.615 --> 08:03.230
It’s not some sort of a...

08:04.538 --> 08:08.118
murti  puja or anything. It’s a human being."

08:08.340 --> 08:10.817
They were quite frightened. They came down.

08:11.122 --> 08:14.971
But something happened to them: with a great

08:15.098 --> 08:19.143
confidence they started all the mantras, everything,

08:19.397 --> 08:22.279
and the vibrations started flowing everywhere.

08:24.098 --> 08:30.343
Even, we were very close to the sea, I found  the sea was roaring.

08:30.660 --> 08:35.151
But people didn’t understand.

08:35.590 --> 08:38.822
Except for these seven people, they said, “Nothing happened to us,

08:38.909 --> 08:41.120
we dideverything so well!”

08:41.849 --> 08:46.019
I think that was the first miracle of Sahaja Yoga.

08:47.544 --> 08:51.248
You see, the trouble with human mind at this level,

08:51.336 --> 08:57.085
or at this time, is that they have too much of self-importance,

08:58.052 --> 09:01.329
and they think no end of themselves.

09:01.898 --> 09:04.485
So already they think, “We are great!

09:04.540 --> 09:08.889
What is there to know ourselves?
We know ourselves very well."

09:09.702 --> 09:17.483
So the basic seeking power is humility.

09:18.129 --> 09:25.580
If you think you know everything, you cannot humble down, and you cannot seek.

09:26.726 --> 09:31.509
Even if you seek, they don’t want to follow anybody’s path.

09:31.562 --> 09:33.067
They say, “We have our own path.

09:33.162 --> 09:35.099
We will follow our own path.

09:35.279 --> 09:37.729
We’ll do whatever we want to do!”

09:38.054 --> 09:43.912
And, like this, I faced many people, in different countries,

09:44.269 --> 09:48.217
who just came to listen to my lecture, that’s all,

09:48.900 --> 09:51.614
but they wouldn’t take Realisation.

09:52.099 --> 09:58.903
And some of them did take their Realisation, they got it, but they got it lost.

10:00.298 --> 10:06.498
Somehow this was such a funny story for me

10:06.736 --> 10:09.839
that: I am giving them Realisation,

10:10.009 --> 10:12.476
I am taking no money for it, nothing.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.262
I used to travel on my own.

10:15.446 --> 10:20.166
But despite that, why is it, that the people

10:20.484 --> 10:24.261
don’t realise the value of Self-realisation?

10:25.892 --> 10:31.279
Then a gentle man who got Realisation, in the first lot,

10:31.830 --> 10:38.984
he told me, “Today, is a consumer society, as they call it, whatever it is."

10:39.540 --> 10:44.670
That, “Unless and until you take money from them, they will never value it.

10:45.019 --> 10:49.732
Let them feel that we have paid for it, for our Realisation.

10:49.872 --> 10:52.531
So at the gate only, you should keep somebody to take money,

10:52.579 --> 10:55.345
otherwise they don’t take to it."

10:56.233 --> 10:59.426
I said, “But you cannot sell it – it’s falsehood.

11:00.042 --> 11:03.821
You cannot sell Self-realisation to people."

11:05.002 --> 11:08.413
He said, “Then, you see, you won’t be successful."

11:09.064 --> 11:14.888
With other gurus this is main thing is that they just accept

11:15.237 --> 11:18.336
the money and even they tell people, “Bring so much money!

11:18.351 --> 11:21.130
Do this much. There is a fees.

11:21.674 --> 11:28.753
And that’s how only the ego is satisfied and people take to false people.

11:31.007 --> 11:35.556
This falsehood, they may realise later on,

11:35.667 --> 11:41.534
because they suffer a lot, with all kinds of physical,  mental problems,

11:41.867 --> 11:45.892
but by that time they are gone cases.

11:47.368 --> 11:53.770
Now the Sahastrara has not been yet described in any one of the books.

11:54.127 --> 11:58.648
Though they have talked about it, in our ancient books, in India also.

11:58.907 --> 12:01.146
They have talked about Sahastrara

12:01.201 --> 12:06.045
but nobody has described it except that it has one thousand petals.

12:08.013 --> 12:12.252
At least if they had mentioned something about it,

12:12.474 --> 12:17.089
it would have been easier for me to show that, “See, this is written in the book."

12:17.201 --> 12:19.530
Because people are like that!

12:19.752 --> 12:25.113
It has to be written in some book and that only they accept.

12:25.935 --> 12:28.234
It’s a very difficult situation!

12:28.527 --> 12:32.237
Because nobody had given a collective Realisation,

12:32.529 --> 12:35.981
so nobody had written to that extent, except for

12:36.125 --> 12:39.767
one or two people who wrote clearly about Kundalini.

12:40.298 --> 12:44.227
But I wouldn’t say it was so clear, because it was all in poetry.

12:44.390 --> 12:50.098
So people would sing the songs, but they would not understand.

12:51.752 --> 12:56.861
But I was thinking, “How these people who were lost,

12:57.309 --> 13:03.579
here and there under some sort of a seeking, what will happen to them?

13:04.434 --> 13:10.090
And how will I be able to give them Self-realisation?”

13:12.839 --> 13:21.010
Experiences were so horrid, but doesn’t matter.

13:21.725 --> 13:28.126
I went on and on and on, and I worked it out.

13:28.585 --> 13:36.491
Of course, we met some people who were also very cruel and nasty,

13:36.999 --> 13:41.819
who troubled me and troubled Sahaja Yogis.

13:42.945 --> 13:53.694
All these things should have really dampened my enthusiasm.

13:54.051 --> 14:00.117
But on the contrary I started thinking, “Why?
Why people are like this?”

14:01.086 --> 14:10.749
Then I realised one thing: that we cannot have the whole world to get Self-realisation.

14:11.789 --> 14:15.571
This is the Last Judgment.

14:15.928 --> 14:22.968
At this time people have to decide what is the most important thing.

14:23.994 --> 14:31.293
They have to know themselves and understand what they have got.

14:33.495 --> 14:44.179
It’s not just having a big number that will help us, but really solid Sahaja Yogis.

14:46.622 --> 14:54.470
Then I found there were people who got cured of many diseases

14:55.028 --> 14:58.488
but most of them got lost.

14:59.131 --> 15:03.343
Some of them, who were drug addicts, gave up drug-addiction.

15:03.931 --> 15:07.785
Drinking, they gave up.
Smoking they gave up.

15:07.881 --> 15:11.431
I never said a word, that, “You give up this or give up that."

15:11.538 --> 15:17.023
I knew, once the Kundalini rises, they will automatically give up.

15:17.678 --> 15:19.433
And it happened.

15:19.545 --> 15:27.380
And that’s how people became so clean, so beautiful, and started enjoying their life.

15:28.056 --> 15:30.407
But nobody would believe them.

15:31.454 --> 15:36.888
When they went round and talked to people, they said, “Oh, you have gone mad!”

15:37.030 --> 15:42.059
They couldn’t believe how they have stopped drinking, how they are not smoking.

15:42.162 --> 15:45.371
They said, “We want to drink! And what is this?”

15:46.018 --> 15:53.851
So, the identification, I found, of these people were mostly

15:54.049 --> 15:59.923
with the very loose type of enjoyment.

16:00.702 --> 16:07.690
They enjoyed very loose type of things, which had nothing to do with the Spirit.

16:08.521 --> 16:12.280
Gradually, of course, it started working out.

16:13.847 --> 16:24.478
But still, I must say, that we can’t expect, in this Kali Yuga,

16:25.193 --> 16:31.484
to have billions and billions of people in Sahaja Yoga.

16:31.777 --> 16:38.452
Though it’s my desire, it’s your desire, and you want them to get their Self-realisation,

16:39.166 --> 16:43.061
by which so many good things can happen.

16:43.273 --> 16:49.257
Firstly, your physical self improves.

16:51.207 --> 16:53.547
Many people have been cured.

16:53.581 --> 16:56.591
Christ cured only twenty one people.

16:57.558 --> 17:04.640
But I don’t know how many thousands have been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

17:05.947 --> 17:14.543
Also there’s another very big problem with human beings:

17:15.487 --> 17:23.926
that they read all kinds of books,

17:24.220 --> 17:29.680
and they have no clear-cut idea as to what they should find,

17:31.095 --> 17:32.976
what is their seeking.

17:34.957 --> 17:37.356
It’s a very big problem.

17:37.627 --> 17:41.037
And whatever is in one book, they’ll try to follow that.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.655
I mean they are  shifting type of people.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.454
They shift from one to another

17:49.011 --> 17:56.460
and then progress in Sahaja Yoga is much more difficult, very difficult,

17:56.817 --> 17:59.544
because if you are going on one path

17:59.655 --> 18:05.025
and you start shifting from one to another, you may go back.

18:05.287 --> 18:08.904
But in that they find it is their ‘freedom’.

18:09.172 --> 18:14.417
Actually without Realisation you don’t have your freedom, of anything.

18:14.841 --> 18:24.581
Freedom is that in which you know what you are,
you know what you are capable of.

18:25.033 --> 18:30.268
In the freedom you are the one who should receive all the blessings.

18:30.879 --> 18:34.857
If these blessings are not there then you are not free.

18:35.048 --> 18:43.343
There’s something wrong, somewhere, in your own life.

18:43.798 --> 18:50.086
Because once you get your Realisation you become absolutely free people.

18:51.042 --> 18:56.793
‘Free’ means, your own Spirit guides you.

18:57.163 --> 19:05.446
The Spirit, as you know, is the reflection of the Divine, the God Almighty.

19:05.908 --> 19:11.446
If everybody has the same reflection and He’s awakened,

19:11.835 --> 19:18.833
then in the awareness it works.
As if they know what is right and what is wrong,

19:18.945 --> 19:22.815
what is constructive and what is destructive.

19:23.841 --> 19:28.433
It is not some sort of a false satisfaction that you have,

19:28.551 --> 19:33.546
but in reality, you feel the Reality.

19:33.891 --> 19:37.311
And that is what it has to happen.

19:37.596 --> 19:41.837
The first thing, in Sahaja Yoga, is that you get the experience,

19:42.120 --> 19:48.674
experience of feeling the spanda, the cool breeze, on your finger tips.

19:49.036 --> 19:52.556
Without the experience you should not believe anything.

19:52.739 --> 20:00.384
That means a new dimension has come now, in your nerves,

20:01.011 --> 20:09.401
that you can feel the system

20:09.953 --> 20:15.352
which has been not known to you.

20:15.493 --> 20:23.918
Sympathetic nervous system was there but you never knew how it is working.

20:24.356 --> 20:28.576
The knowledge about yourself was so poor.

20:29.059 --> 20:34.177
But after Realisation suddenly the whole thing got enlightened.

20:34.555 --> 20:40.001
Suddenly you started feeling it, the newness, among yourselves.

20:40.355 --> 20:43.943
Still sometimes you haveto fight your ego,

20:44.101 --> 20:47.791
you have to get over your ignorance of things.

20:48.352 --> 20:52.061
Because Realisation gives you Absolute Knowledge,

20:52.854 --> 20:56.658
Absolute Knowledge. It cannot be challenged.

20:58.269 --> 21:03.556
It’s single: as they call it – ‘Ekameva Satya’, (the only Truth).

21:04.137 --> 21:11.254
And when you get that knowledge then you can tally it also.

21:11.548 --> 21:16.045
You can find out if it is correct or not.

21:17.264 --> 21:21.912
This is something that has happened to all of you,

21:22.110 --> 21:28.915
and you have already got those vibrations with which you can feel it.

21:29.782 --> 21:37.282
For example, there may be some dissatisfied souls with Sahaja Yoga.

21:38.299 --> 21:45.919
But you can find out, on vibrations, who are these people and what are they doing.

21:46.188 --> 21:54.282
On vibrations you can make out if those people have reached
that state of Reality or not.

21:54.709 --> 22:00.423
You can make out if these people, who are

22:01.034 --> 22:07.242
trying to oppose you, or trying to tell you something else –
“How far are they?”

22:08.202 --> 22:11.032
On your fingertips you know.

22:11.143 --> 22:17.111
This is what is Qiyamah about which Mohammed Saheb has said.

22:17.505 --> 22:22.263
The other day I must tell you, an experience we had: There was one fellow

22:22.453 --> 22:28.910
who came from the television  known as ‘Star’.

22:29.535 --> 22:35.935
And he started asking me very funny questions, which had no relevance.

22:36.651 --> 22:39.765
His name was ‘Abbas’, so I said, “Abbas bhaiya,

22:39.921 --> 22:44.631
you are wasting your time and my time.
Will you come to the right questions!”

22:45.988 --> 22:50.036
So he said, “I am against all fundamentalism."

22:50.203 --> 22:52.010
“But I am not fundamentalist.

22:52.674 --> 22:56.392
How do you know I am that or not?”

22:57.533 --> 23:00.383
So he said, “I am trying to find out!”

23:00.590 --> 23:03.870
“Alright,” I said, “you put your hands towards me.

23:04.152 --> 23:09.091
Mohammed Saheb has said that ‘At the time of, Qiyamah your hands will speak’."

23:09.397 --> 23:14.330
And, you will be amazed, immediately he started feeling cool breeze on his hands.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.942
He said, “What’s happening to me?”
I said, “That’s what it is!”

23:21.791 --> 23:26.412
No use arguing, no use talking about it,

23:26.585 --> 23:29.380
no use enquiring.

23:29.516 --> 23:31.930
Just see yourself the experience of it.

23:32.121 --> 23:40.446
He just got so stunned and after that whatever he talked to me, he never published it.

23:41.288 --> 23:46.111
So what I am saying  that if the people reach the Truth

23:46.505 --> 23:51.610
and they know this is the Truth, nothing can change them.

23:51.797 --> 23:54.517
If they have reached the Truth, I am saying.

23:54.620 --> 24:00.690
You can see in the life of all the great people that they think “This is the Truth”.

24:00.863 --> 24:09.303
Not by just reading, not by just believing but as an experience,

24:09.723 --> 24:14.594
that, on their central nervous system they can feel the Truth.

24:14.971 --> 24:20.155
Then it is impossible to change them.

24:20.665 --> 24:27.345
Like you can see a seed becomes a tree, then you cannot make the tree into a seed.

24:27.599 --> 24:33.193
Seed is a seed, but when the seed changes into the tree

24:33.399 --> 24:36.484
then you cannot bring it back to the seed.

24:36.832 --> 24:39.692
It may create more seeds, that’s different.

24:40.133 --> 24:44.453
so, in the same way, once you have got your Realisation,

24:44.588 --> 24:47.699
and once you have become one with the Divine,

24:48.072 --> 24:52.912
then there is no question of you going down, unless and until you,

24:53.005 --> 24:55.055
yourself, want to go down.

24:56.861 --> 25:01.957
It’s very very remarkable, how you get this property,

25:02.108 --> 25:06.817
how you get this ability and this capability,

25:06.975 --> 25:10.462
and after that you don’t lose it!

25:10.768 --> 25:16.308
Of course, first you must grow, and for that you have to meditate.

25:16.946 --> 25:22.844
But this meditation, once you do it, the whole

25:23.074 --> 25:30.009
being itself gets so enlightened and so beautiful that you don’t want to change it.

25:30.215 --> 25:33.815
You want to be there and enjoy it forever.

25:34.211 --> 25:37.073
But of course you want to give it to others

25:37.216 --> 25:40.067
because you see  you are enjoying so much.

25:40.157 --> 25:43.072
Like, on the street, you find somebody

25:43.191 --> 25:47.422
starving and you are very full, then you feel like giving food to that person.

25:47.581 --> 25:52.753
In the same way, you see in this world, people are madly seeking, running up and down,

25:52.852 --> 25:55.843
doing all kinds of things, so you want to tell them.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.123
They may or may not believe.

25:58.249 --> 26:08.269
They may try to absolutely deny you, defy you.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.263
They can do anything.

26:10.327 --> 26:15.802
But you know for definite that you are on the right path, you are on the

26:16.040 --> 26:21.855
right state of mind which is a Sahaja state.

26:22.299 --> 26:27.330
In Sanskrit it is called ‘sahaja avastha’, ‘sahajavastha’.

26:27.496 --> 26:33.040
In sahajavastha you do not react, you do not react.

26:33.435 --> 26:35.015
You just see and appreciate.

26:35.164 --> 26:40.069
Now see: I came, I saw this beautiful, such an idea of Sahastrara,

26:40.156 --> 26:45.778
all the chakras, they have crossed over, gone up there and from there they have.

26:45.922 --> 26:48.182
Very good expression.

26:49.698 --> 26:56.278
But any other person would say, “Oh, this colour combination is not good!”

26:58.117 --> 27:00.000
“Why did they use this?

27:00.222 --> 27:02.273
Why don’t they use something else?”

27:02.289 --> 27:06.214
Like that, you see, finding faults with others!

27:07.646 --> 27:14.626
And this finding faults actually comes from your brain which is not yet enlightened.

27:14.745 --> 27:18.480
You cannot enjoy anything because you react.

27:18.599 --> 27:20.489
All the time you go on reacting.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.533
If somebody says something nice, still you are reacting.

27:24.787 --> 27:29.069
If someone says something bad, of course you are reacting!

27:29.404 --> 27:30.874
No question!

27:31.755 --> 27:40.373
So for us to understand that
we are not free to react, we are not that cheap to react.

27:42.858 --> 27:46.049
We are on a very high pedestal.

27:46.187 --> 27:49.471
What is our job Is to enjoy?

27:49.773 --> 27:52.061
Enjoy everything.

27:52.656 --> 27:59.554
And that enjoyment is the blessing of the Divine.

28:00.568 --> 28:06.109
Even you can enjoy the turmoil and the torture.

28:06.427 --> 28:10.529
Everything you can enjoy if you see the point that:

28:10.688 --> 28:15.717
nothing can happen to your Spirit, which is the real light.

28:16.004 --> 28:23.112
Whatever you may suffer, whatever you may think is troubling you –

28:23.271 --> 28:28.757
actually this silent light of the Spirit

28:28.804 --> 28:36.942
makes you absolutely, perfectly joyous and you give joy to others.

28:37.474 --> 28:40.925
You don’t design it, you don’t plan it,

28:41.036 --> 28:44.859
how to give joy, but you just automatically give joy.

28:45.628 --> 28:54.073
And this giving joy is also effortless, sahaj, because you are in the sahaja state.

28:54.403 --> 29:02.983
In the sahaja state you just see things.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.421
It’s a drama, you feel.

29:06.564 --> 29:12.799
It’s a different styles, different types and you just see and watch,

29:13.254 --> 29:17.632
and get the joy out of it.

29:18.704 --> 29:23.524
It is not important to say, “I like this, I like that." No!

29:24.993 --> 29:29.463
That ‘I’, which likes, is nothing but ego,

29:29.622 --> 29:38.127
and keeps you out of the enjoyment which is reality, which is real.

29:38.292 --> 29:45.448
Every thing in this world, that you find is troublesome,

29:45.691 --> 29:53.761
if you see  from another angle, from a sahajasthiti,
you won’t feel the troubles.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.118
But that higher life should be there.

29:58.323 --> 30:02.858
That higher standard should be built-in within you.

30:03.628 --> 30:08.350
The other day I had a meeting with the bureaucrats

30:08.771 --> 30:11.882
and I told them, “I know that the pay is less.

30:12.160 --> 30:18.095
You may think that the others get much more pay, they are having much more facilities.

30:18.500 --> 30:23.018
But there is one way you can really enjoy your work:

30:23.193 --> 30:26.946
if you have patriotism, deshabhakti."

30:27.100 --> 30:34.050
If you have patriotism for your country, no amount of sacrifice

30:34.715 --> 30:38.344
will satisfy you. You’ll want to give everything.

30:38.552 --> 30:45.508
And you can go through all kinds of so-called dearth and depressive states

30:45.714 --> 30:48.744
without even feeling anything about it.

30:49.650 --> 30:54.827
And, at the same time, your feelings become very deep.

30:55.700 --> 31:03.651
For example, you are travelling and suddenly you find somebody who is sick:

31:03.903 --> 31:08.635
you can feel it on your vibrations that this person is sick;

31:08.822 --> 31:14.147
and immediately your sympathy and your love flows to that person.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.949
You will try to help that person.

31:16.288 --> 31:19.846
If possible you will try to even cure that person.

31:20.168 --> 31:25.115
Just like that, your whole being becomes like an ocean

31:25.219 --> 31:29.617
which absorbs all the rivers and

31:29.731 --> 31:37.823
all kinds of watery things, whatever it is, within its abdomen, I should say.

31:38.077 --> 31:44.660
It just takes all that is there,

31:44.851 --> 31:48.956
but it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t trouble him.

31:49.468 --> 31:54.881
He is like over-powering person, with his love.

31:55.335 --> 31:57.155
He doesn’t show his power.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.364
He does not bother about his self-importance.

32:00.483 --> 32:05.724
If somebody tries to insult you, “Alright."

32:06.550 --> 32:09.422
What is there there, the insult part of it?

32:09.591 --> 32:13.587
And such people who have reached that sahajavastha

32:13.714 --> 32:18.357
are the greatest creators of art, of music,

32:18.920 --> 32:24.150
of great thoughts and that’s why these survive.

32:24.301 --> 32:28.980
So many people write, but it goes out.

32:29.093 --> 32:33.026
So many people create, but nobody bothers.

32:33.303 --> 32:38.404
But those who are Realised-souls, whatever they create, is of eternal nature.

32:38.697 --> 32:43.322
Because they are now in the Ocean of Eternity.

32:43.822 --> 32:48.515
They are in the ocean of purity,

32:48.673 --> 32:56.092
where there is no idea at all, of hurting anyone or troubling anyone.

32:57.306 --> 32:59.706
Such a protection is there for them.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.996
They cannot be harmed!

33:03.242 --> 33:07.525
Because after all you have entered into the kingdom of God,

33:07.843 --> 33:11.951
so who can dare harm you or trouble you?

33:12.443 --> 33:22.260
Such a prosperity I have seen among Sahaja Yogis,
and such a generosity that they have,

33:22.752 --> 33:26.052
and such understanding about things.

33:26.322 --> 33:31.140
I don’t have to give lectures, “Now don’t do this and don’t do that!”

33:31.205 --> 33:32.915
No, no more.

33:34.343 --> 33:45.429
And those who are not yet already matured in Sahaja Yoga should try to mature.

33:45.861 --> 33:51.737
And those who are not matured and troubling, don’t worry about them.

33:51.849 --> 33:53.962
You should have pity.

33:54.073 --> 33:58.927
You should really have pity for such people that they are so immature.

33:59.546 --> 34:04.631
Today it is something great, I feel, because thirty years I have been

34:04.774 --> 34:11.471
running up and down everywhere and I have been able to gather so many people.

34:11.868 --> 34:17.699
There are so many Sahaja Yogis, you see, and also, all over the world.

34:18.096 --> 34:20.490
This is just a wee-bit of that.

34:20.680 --> 34:27.051
So this is something  was to happen, has been already described,

34:27.432 --> 34:32.392
has been prophesised by people that such and such thing will be happen,

34:32.646 --> 34:36.910
that so many people will get their Self-realisation.

34:37.250 --> 34:42.077
Unbelievable it was, of course, but, as now you see,

34:42.349 --> 34:47.847
how sweet is the feeling that we are all one.

34:48.242 --> 34:55.175
There’s no quarrel, no fight, no bad ideas, and nobody likes cheap things.

34:55.780 --> 35:04.906
They want to have something that is pleasing and has a quality of understanding.

35:06.816 --> 35:11.306
And I have seen people becoming poets, writing beautiful poetry.

35:11.687 --> 35:14.515
I have seen people becoming orators.

35:14.706 --> 35:21.777
Also I have seen people becoming very good organisers.

35:22.370 --> 35:28.410
But one thing is very important, is the humility.

35:28.831 --> 35:35.315
I said in the beginning and again I would say: what will appeal to people is your humility.

35:35.918 --> 35:41.863
You should be a humble person, not think that you are something special,

35:42.053 --> 35:54.618
or not think that you are some sort of a self-important person.

35:55.257 --> 36:01.627
Once you think that you are important then you are not part and parcel of the whole.

36:01.793 --> 36:07.817
If my one hand starts thinking, “I am important,” it’s stupid.

36:08.111 --> 36:10.146
How can one hand be important?

36:10.336 --> 36:12.386
All hands are needed.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.348
Everything is needed.

36:14.446 --> 36:15.906
Legs are needed.

36:16.012 --> 36:18.803
How can one part be so important?

36:19.036 --> 36:25.089
If you start thinking like that anywhere in your journey of Sahaja Yoga,

36:25.160 --> 36:28.294
then I must say, you are not in the sahajavastha.

36:28.493 --> 36:37.522
So my own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja,

36:37.985 --> 36:43.207
where you will be absolutely one with your Self,

36:43.295 --> 36:47.670
one with the nature, one with all the people

36:47.821 --> 36:52.943
who are around you, with your own country, and countries.

36:53.276 --> 36:58.791
Everywhere, the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmanda (universe)

36:59.040 --> 37:04.350
becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that.

37:04.540 --> 37:15.041
Then the echoes – they call ‘ninaad’

37:15.271 --> 37:21.514
the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen.

37:21.935 --> 37:28.006
Not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing

37:28.196 --> 37:33.701
but in the spiritual area, which is the highest.

37:34.764 --> 37:40.074
Everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality

37:40.241 --> 37:43.822
and, till today, they are all remembered.

37:44.013 --> 37:52.347
In the same way you all will be representing a very great knowledge

37:52.551 --> 37:59.596
about Reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working.

37:59.716 --> 38:04.786
In every way you can do anything.

38:05.040 --> 38:09.393
Now, only thing that, now, we have to do is to decide:

38:09.496 --> 38:12.634
how many people we are going to give Realisation?

38:12.951 --> 38:14.861
What we can do for Realisation?

38:15.492 --> 38:17.068
What should we do?

38:17.314 --> 38:23.256
This is the only thing, if you go on with your

38:23.510 --> 38:35.838
complete emancipation, you will be surprised, it’s like climbing up a big mountain.

38:36.934 --> 38:40.793
But when you have reached to the peak, you can see everything very well,

38:40.912 --> 38:44.272
and you feel so satisfied that you are at the peak.

38:44.882 --> 38:50.041
So, that climbing part, even  some of you have to do it,

38:50.279 --> 38:54.011
it is alright, there’s no problem, you can do it.

38:54.119 --> 38:57.746
You must have respect for yourself, love yourself,

38:57.812 --> 39:02.771
and  understanding that you have to reach the peak, peak of the mountain.

39:02.883 --> 39:06.756
And once you have reached the peak of the mountain you will know you are there.

39:07.039 --> 39:11.159
And then you start showering all your love,

39:11.349 --> 39:15.775
affection, and everything, that flows down the mountain.

39:15.869 --> 39:17.859
That is the life for you.

39:18.069 --> 39:20.737
It’s the greatest type of life.

39:20.846 --> 39:27.205
Forget all other people: politicians and all other people who were supposed to be great.

39:27.287 --> 39:28.517
Forget them!

39:28.604 --> 39:31.021
You are much higher than that,

39:31.530 --> 39:41.298
because you are already chiselled like a diamond with the Sahaj style of life;

39:41.790 --> 39:49.929
which is very satisfying and also which is very much absolutely peace giving.

39:50.195 --> 39:53.625
It gives you joy, it gives you peace,

39:53.747 --> 39:58.900
it gives you capabilities, it gives you so many things that you cannot count,

39:59.194 --> 40:03.914
like the thousand petals of your Sahastrara which are enlightened.

40:04.032 --> 40:07.942
God knows what all you can have with this!

40:08.203 --> 40:14.281
This is such a tremendous area you are in – the thousand petals.

40:14.569 --> 40:18.970
And from there, people have gained all the knowledge about science,

40:19.065 --> 40:23.146
knowledge about all the great discoveries are from there.

40:23.479 --> 40:28.892
So this is what one has to realise one’s own esteem.

40:29.044 --> 40:35.016
Self-esteem is different form self-importance.

40:35.369 --> 40:37.491
You should have self-esteem.

40:37.645 --> 40:40.020
With that you will become humble.

40:41.166 --> 40:46.235
You will become very loving because you are capable of love.

40:46.558 --> 40:49.277
And it is not forced on you.

40:49.771 --> 40:56.040
I agree that from the ocean the clouds rise

40:56.255 --> 40:58.392
and then they give rain and all that,

40:58.494 --> 41:02.509
but it is in the cycle of life  they are doing it.

41:02.777 --> 41:06.258
They are not conscious of it.

41:06.601 --> 41:11.461
They don’t think that they are doing something great because they are in the cycle.

41:11.657 --> 41:15.285
You are out of the cycle and still you are doing

41:15.571 --> 41:21.417
work without any feeling of self-importance.

41:22.131 --> 41:24.920
You are doing because you have to do it!

41:25.122 --> 41:31.633
Another cycle, not the natural cycle, but another cycle of awareness,

41:31.760 --> 41:34.723
where you are aware as to what you are doing.

41:34.858 --> 41:41.127
At the same time you are very humble, you are very loving, you are very kind.

41:41.967 --> 41:45.208
You don’t shout, you don’t beat anyone.

41:45.681 --> 41:48.571
You don’t say anything harsh to anyone.

41:48.649 --> 41:53.106
And you can manage the most difficult person.

41:53.246 --> 41:57.368
If someone tries to be funny, you can always raise the Kundalini

41:57.559 --> 41:59.755
and be satisfied with it.

41:59.898 --> 42:05.268
If you secretly raise the Kundalini, the other person is finished!

42:05.498 --> 42:08.410
If you cannot raise it, then forget it!

42:08.700 --> 42:12.201
Forget it! He is a difficult person, you know, it’s a stone.

42:12.352 --> 42:14.609
Now in the stone, what can you do?

42:14.715 --> 42:24.879
You cannot make it flow, the love and the dignity, all these qualities.

42:25.078 --> 42:30.528
It is not possible from a stone-hearted person, so forget it, that’s not your job.

42:30.975 --> 42:32.746
That’s not your job at all.

42:32.858 --> 42:39.680
So, I would request that, first of all, you should see that: how much humble we are.

42:40.023 --> 42:47.183
You have to be very humble and that is your decoration, that is your beauty.

42:47.626 --> 42:54.879
So you have your love, which is pure, without any lust or greed.

42:55.071 --> 43:01.193
You love others only because you are in love.

43:01.903 --> 43:06.982
And then, secondly, you are blessed with peace,

43:07.149 --> 43:11.212
you are absolutely at peace with yourself.

43:11.361 --> 43:15.155
And you will be amazed – with peace, wisdom will come to you.

43:15.583 --> 43:19.978
You will be regarded as the wisest man, wisest woman,

43:20.090 --> 43:22.783
because you are at peace with yourself.

43:22.985 --> 43:27.623
Only in peace you can discover the Truth,

43:27.766 --> 43:32.060
you can discover every solution that you want to.

43:32.964 --> 43:40.783
You become  very wise and sensible person – outstandingly great than others.

43:41.135 --> 43:44.137
You are not like common, general, people.

43:44.674 --> 43:48.341
Then you have joy.

43:48.497 --> 43:54.315
Joy is something I cannot express in words but still

43:54.415 --> 43:58.657
joy, as I have told you many a times, it is singular.

43:58.823 --> 44:02.936
It is not happiness or unhappiness, it is just joy.

44:03.167 --> 44:04.924
Just you enjoy.

44:05.259 --> 44:12.201
You enjoy everything, enjoy every company, every incident,

44:12.312 --> 44:16.673
every scene, every happening in your life.

44:16.760 --> 44:19.254
You know how to enjoy everything.

44:20.193 --> 44:23.410
You see, just joy has a great capacity.

44:23.881 --> 44:28.331
Once, I remember I had gone with my son-in-law and daughter

44:28.450 --> 44:32.624
to see some historical place and we had to climb a lot.

44:33.150 --> 44:37.997
We were climbing for about three hours, so, naturally, we all got tired

44:38.274 --> 44:42.710
and there was a little resting place, made of marble,

44:42.869 --> 44:46.536
so we said, “Let us spread out ourselves here!”

44:46.821 --> 44:50.241
So when I spread it out, they were so much

44:50.368 --> 44:55.641
saying, “Why should we have come here, of all the things"
All that they were grudging.

44:55.799 --> 45:03.195
Then suddenly, you know – this is the joy point –
suddenly I saw the carvings of elephants.

45:03.525 --> 45:06.177
So I said, “Can you see these elephants?

45:06.331 --> 45:10.277
Everybody’s tail is differently made!”

45:11.348 --> 45:16.370
They said, “Mummy, how could you see the elephants’ tails?

45:16.489 --> 45:18.802
We are so tired!”

45:18.881 --> 45:21.463
I said, “You also see! Just see that."

45:21.633 --> 45:28.663
Because this joy, it shifts, shifts your mind from nonsense.

45:29.217 --> 45:31.563
You just say, “It’s all nonsense."

45:31.619 --> 45:33.421
You just shift your mind.

45:33.484 --> 45:35.280
This is the way you get joy!

45:35.351 --> 45:38.076
And goes to the thing that will  joy giving.

45:38.155 --> 45:42.083
Supposing there is a person who is quite boring,

45:42.202 --> 45:46.386
you know, then what happens, you just see the

45:46.553 --> 45:52.029
humour behind boring: how a person bores you!

45:54.161 --> 46:03.581
And what you learn out of it is – never bore anyone.

46:05.779 --> 46:15.956
So this joy has a speciality, that it teaches you the essence of joy of everything.

46:16.316 --> 46:24.616
If it is a bad film, still you enjoy because you see how bad it is.

46:25.183 --> 46:29.918
Supposing, of course if it is a good film, then you can always see them!

46:30.378 --> 46:36.407
But you do not go with a mind, how to criticise.

46:36.684 --> 46:40.224
This criticism business goes out of your mind.

46:40.326 --> 46:44.435
So what happens  your mind shifts immediately

46:44.570 --> 46:50.007
from something that is ridiculous to something interesting in the same thing.

46:50.339 --> 46:55.318
So you don’t criticise and you don’t feel bad about it.

46:55.702 --> 47:03.882
Sometimes it so happens that people are amazed that how I tolerate such people.

47:04.191 --> 47:09.331
But I don’t tolerate, I am not paying any attention, whatever the person may be doing.

47:09.545 --> 47:16.563
If you are of that nature, that we can call as a condition

47:16.821 --> 47:22.761
where you are absolutely in the Turya state:

47:22.992 --> 47:26.476
so Kabira has said, “Jab mast hue, fir kya bole?”

47:26.603 --> 47:31.521
When I have gone into that state of joy, why should I say anything?

47:32.197 --> 47:39.258
It is like that: a temperament which you have to understand, and respect it.

47:39.427 --> 47:41.627
That is within you, but respect it.

47:41.761 --> 47:46.148
Do not compare it with others, others are not at your level.

47:46.257 --> 47:50.486
So you are at a different level and you just try to enjoy.

47:50.691 --> 47:55.078
Never feel that you are something higher or greater – no, never feel .

47:55.259 --> 48:02.579
What you should feel  that thankfulness that you are not mixed up with

48:02.962 --> 48:08.594
all those funny ideas and funny style of life

48:08.674 --> 48:11.509
where you go on criticising – “This is not good!
I don’t like it!

48:11.620 --> 48:13.021
I don’t like it!”

48:14.563 --> 48:17.038
Who are you?You don’t know yourself.

48:17.149 --> 48:20.289
When you say, “I don’t like it,” you are not knowing yourself.

48:20.614 --> 48:23.886
How do you know what you don’t like?

48:24.085 --> 48:29.666
I have seen people with very poor knowledge,

48:29.983 --> 48:36.901
who are just knowing  little bit here and there, are very critical of others.

48:37.179 --> 48:39.761
I don’t know the reason, why it is so.

48:39.854 --> 48:43.024
But maybe that they think no end of themselves!

48:43.835 --> 48:46.324
But this is what is very common.

48:46.538 --> 48:52.482
But if you know the Absolute Knowledge, then you become really humble;

48:52.649 --> 48:58.939
absolutely humble and sweet, gentle and kind.

48:59.954 --> 49:05.137
So today is a great day otherwise, for me also: I didn’t know

49:05.208 --> 49:09.673
that I will survive so many years to see this beautiful day.

49:10.110 --> 49:16.640
Because after all, it was very hard life, according to others’ standards.

49:16.918 --> 49:24.723
But what is most joy giving to me was creating Sahaja Yogis,

49:25.128 --> 49:29.331
and listening to them and talking to them,

49:29.617 --> 49:35.842
the way they were so sweet and so kind and so respectful!

49:36.254 --> 49:41.125
All this has helped me so much and I must thank you for that.

49:41.355 --> 49:48.394
With your support, with your help, with your understanding, I could achieve it.

49:48.822 --> 49:55.792
If I could have achieve it on my own, I would never have asked for this help of yours.

49:56.003 --> 50:00.674
But you are just like my hands, you are just like my eyes.

50:00.778 --> 50:04.685
And I need you very much because, without you I cannot do it.

50:04.770 --> 50:08.381
It’s like channelising: unless and until you have channels,

50:08.524 --> 50:11.687
what’s the use of being Adi Shakti or anything?

50:11.722 --> 50:13.417
How will you channelise it?

50:13.861 --> 50:22.462
If there is electrical movement, you need channels, otherwise its a static thing.

50:22.847 --> 50:28.518
In the same way I felt, always, that I needed more and more channels,

50:28.637 --> 50:34.349
and when it worked out, I was really, really in a very great Spirit.

50:34.543 --> 50:40.076
So I thank you very much, again, for this day that has come.

50:40.338 --> 50:45.478
And I bless you from my heart that – now you take over responsibility.

50:45.676 --> 50:50.320
You are a Sahaja Yogi, so you have a responsibility, also,

50:50.399 --> 50:53.829
to give Realisation to others. Don’t keep to yourself.

50:53.910 --> 50:56.197
This has to be given to others.

50:56.380 --> 50:59.552
And you can explain, you can talk to them,

50:59.664 --> 51:02.354
you can really, very well, understand them.

51:02.554 --> 51:07.174
Try to understand them and talk to them.

51:07.331 --> 51:13.016
And you must give Realisation to others, otherwise you won’t feel complete.

51:13.343 --> 51:15.993
To feel complete, you have to do that.

51:16.239 --> 51:18.115
May God bless you all.
