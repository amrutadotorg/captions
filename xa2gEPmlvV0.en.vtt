00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.077
Guru Puja Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

00:00:02.198 --> 00:00:08.944
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.500
What does a guru do.

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.642
Whatever you have,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.096
all the precious things within you,

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:47.880
he discovers them for your knowledge.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.679
Actually it is all there -

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.044
everything.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.520
All the knowledge, all the spirituality,

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:10.416
all the joy, is there.

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:13.557
Right time!

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.640
It's all contained within you.

00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:36.230
Only thing the Guru does

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.924
makes you knowledgeable about your knowledge,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.273
about your own spirit.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:56.913
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:04.058
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:10.422
There is nothing that you get from outside.

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:15.876
But before getting this knowledge, you are dealing,

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:22.033
 or you are living in ignorance.

00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:27.764
In that ignorance you do not know

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:33.734
what treasure you have got within yourself.

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:41.059
So the guru's job is to make you know what you are.

00:02:49.528 --> 00:02:53.488
That is the first step.

00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:56.575
That it starts,

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.329
that awakening within you

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:04.757
by which you know

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:08.693
that you are not this outside world,

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.839
this is all an illusion.

00:03:13.648 --> 00:03:19.583
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:27.197
Some people get full light and some people get it gradually.

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:33.819
Essence of all the religions is that you should know yourself.

00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:39.443
Those people who are fighting in the name of religion,

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.765
you have to go and ask them,

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:47.714
you have to enquire from them,

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.718
"Did your religion make you know yourself?"

00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:56.902
If all the religions have said one thing -

00:03:57.233 --> 00:04:03.168
you have to do all these things just to know yourself.

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:09.516
But people get into rituals.

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:15.696
They think by doing all these rituals they are near God.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.683
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves, and

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:27.841
day in and day out they work out something,

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:31.945
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

00:04:33.687 --> 00:04:37.288
Lots of acrobats, prayers,

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:41.472
pujas, these things go on.

00:04:41.734 --> 00:04:45.207
Because it is all ignorance.

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.276
People go on paying them money

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:51.985
and they become very rich

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:56.741
and their interest is only money.

00:04:58.154 --> 00:05:03.197
They want to take all your money, absolutely,

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:06.610
and make a fool out of you.

00:05:07.818 --> 00:05:11.088
They pamper your ego.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.556
With pampering of that ego you just start drifting

00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:21.499
into the ocean of illusion

00:05:21.786 --> 00:05:27.476
and you are drowned into that illusion,

00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:29.824
thinking that you are very religious

00:05:30.102 --> 00:05:35.197
and you are just in connection with God, which you are not.

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:40.669
To know God you should know your Self first.

00:05:40.947 --> 00:05:45.637
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:51.848
That's essential, that you should know your Self.

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:58.578
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:03.056
The experience is not sufficient.

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:07.056
The knowledge has to come.

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:13.274
And the guru gives the knowledge about your Self.

00:06:14.532 --> 00:06:18.274
Now you have to tally it.

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:22.578
You should find out whatever your guru has told you.

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:27.684
Is it true or not? Is it correct or not?

00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:32.548
Or is it just another illusion?

00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:40.314
Now in this ascent people get into lots of problems.

00:06:40.528 --> 00:06:45.969
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially in the west.

00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:50.652
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are great,

00:06:50.853 --> 00:06:52.723
you are better than others,

00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:56.930
and there is something special about you.

00:06:57.168 --> 00:07:02.057
This ignorance is more dangerous

00:07:02.343 --> 00:07:05.501
than the worldly ignorance, I think,

00:07:05.723 --> 00:07:11.675
because in the worldly ignorance, you do feel the

00:07:16.073 --> 00:07:19.876
consequences of wrong things.

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:23.881
But when you are half way,

00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:29.932
when your ignorance is that about yourself,

00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:34.148
when you are going to a higher realm,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:40.399
then one should always understand that you cannot have ego.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.929
Then what starts is introspection.

00:07:56.001 --> 00:08:00.832
You start looking at yourself,

00:08:01.062 --> 00:08:04.666
what's wrong with you.

00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:07.958
When you understand that you have ego,

00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:11.047
you start looking at yourself.

00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:17.253
Or when you find there is something missing

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:20.727
or something wrong,

00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:24.688
then also, you start introspecting.

00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:31.797
This should be a very, very honest, very honest effort.

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:36.819
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early stage

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.009
start thinking they that they are very great

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.647
and they don't need any introspection.

00:08:43.848 --> 00:08:49.790
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance

00:08:50.607 --> 00:08:56.551
without achieving Selfhood or I can call it Self realisation.

00:08:58.257 --> 00:09:03.269
So you have to introspect and see for yourself

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.159
what have you been doing, what are you,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.423
how far you have come.

00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:14.444
How much --

00:09:14.645 --> 00:09:18.775
please don't translate just now all right? You can do it later on.

00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:25.287
You must hear with full concentration.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:30.700
Even if you don't understand it will work.

00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:36.565
Now the style of such a person changes gradually. How?

00:09:36.922 --> 00:09:41.292
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,

00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:47.340
hot-tempered and full of ego

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:52.530
starts becoming very gentle and mild.

00:09:53.889 --> 00:09:59.031
Another type, which is frightened and afraid

00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:05.285
and very cautious, starts becoming fearless.

00:10:07.689 --> 00:10:11.793
At that stage you have no fears.

00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:16.415
You are sure that you are on the right path

00:10:16.685 --> 00:10:20.705
and you are moving on the right lines.

00:10:23.718 --> 00:10:26.559
You are not easily disturbed there.

00:10:26.782 --> 00:10:32.067
But still you have to rise higher and higher,

00:10:32.353 --> 00:10:36.584
where, when you meditate, you understand,

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:41.901
that there is something wrong within yourself.

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:45.537
You have achieved your Self realisation.

00:10:45.775 --> 00:10:49.092
You have got the blessings of Self realisation.

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:52.076
Your health is good,

00:10:52.362 --> 00:10:57.682
you have got all kinds of blessings which you cannot count.

00:10:57.939 --> 00:11:01.573
All that is there but...

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:07.462
still you have to go further.

00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:12.841
And that is to understand

00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:19.095
all the knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:28.187
You have to understand through your mental capacity,

00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:32.980
first, to begin with, and then you have to verify

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.431
how far it is correct.

00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:40.770
How far you have understood it,

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.919
how far you have worked on it,

00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:49.306
how far you know.

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:57.984
And when you start seeing yourself,

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:01.661
you start

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:07.669
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

00:12:08.182 --> 00:12:13.079
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,

00:12:13.388 --> 00:12:18.388
you don't talk too much, you don't harass anyone.

00:12:18.808 --> 00:12:23.831
You are a very pleasant person, very gentle,

00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:28.220
very understanding.

00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:35.715
This person has to verify

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:39.808
how he is behaving towards others.

00:12:43.487 --> 00:12:49.072
Now the attention starts moving from oneself to another

00:12:49.286 --> 00:12:53.365
and you start seeing how you behave.

00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:58.373
How you love.

00:12:58.848 --> 00:13:04.110
What is the quality of your compassion?

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:11.244
When you love somebody

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:17.085
without any expectations, just love, then

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:23.432
you are absolutely dedicated to that person, absolutely.

00:13:24.514 --> 00:13:27.521
you just obey.

00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:31.610
You will do anything for that person.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:37.660
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

00:13:39.492 --> 00:13:42.826
This is just the love.

00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:45.969
Surrender is nothing but the love,

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:52.032
and that love, which is extremely joy-giving,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.230
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,

00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:05.254
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

00:14:06.778 --> 00:14:12.069
All the bad qualities you have,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:18.231
you can call them, all the deficiencies you have,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.128
all the problems you have,

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:29.177
you understand and you get over it.

00:14:29.439 --> 00:14:34.875
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,

00:14:35.113 --> 00:14:39.422
with the same troubles,

00:14:39.676 --> 00:14:45.009
you in the love of that person

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.660
you try to tolerate.

00:14:49.113 --> 00:14:52.748
Such a person just tolerates.

00:15:02.683 --> 00:15:06.683
There is no aggression,

00:15:06.937 --> 00:15:12.271
and these people forgive.

00:15:12.906 --> 00:15:14.744
Realised Souls go on forgiving,

00:15:14.945 --> 00:15:18.540
their capacity to forgive is tremendous.

00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:25.015
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.015
They don't have any anger about anyone.

00:15:29.245 --> 00:15:35.145
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and forgiving.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:40.026
This forgiveness is just

00:15:40.264 --> 00:15:46.211
a music, I should say, of your bhakti.

00:15:46.983 --> 00:15:50.062
The amount of forgiveness

00:15:50.268 --> 00:15:55.157
these masters could have, can be seen from the life of Christ.

00:15:56.244 --> 00:16:01.080
They are tortured, crucified - most of the saints were tortured.

00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.588
People never liked them.

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:09.746
And they were crucified, but as you know

00:16:10.564 --> 00:16:14.810
that they never resented,

00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:18.008
they never take a revenge,

00:16:18.214 --> 00:16:24.163
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:30.431
They had compassion and compassion for such people,

00:16:30.653 --> 00:16:36.622
they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive them.

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:42.962
What they are doing they don't know'.

00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:45.761
Extremely compassionate.

00:16:45.983 --> 00:16:49.965
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:54.055
When it becomes their nature,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:17:00.917
they become people with complete peace.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.969
They are not disturbed.

00:17:05.169 --> 00:17:09.899
They are never disturbed with whatever is happening

00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:14.303
and they think it's God's will.

00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:17.400
Because nothing can disturb them,

00:17:17.747 --> 00:17:20.898
nothing can upset them.

00:17:22.628 --> 00:17:28.545
They just enjoy their devotion.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:35.305
Devotion to their guru maybe.

00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:39.202
Devotion to God.

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:45.805
In that devotion they may write

00:17:46.114 --> 00:17:51.378
beautiful poetry, they may go on dancing,

00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:56.330
they may go on singing, because the peace is within

00:17:56.561 --> 00:18:01.509
and they are enjoying themselves.

00:18:04.898 --> 00:18:09.544
When they are alone, they are never alone,

00:18:09.814 --> 00:18:12.787
they enjoy themselves.

00:18:13.012 --> 00:18:16.726
They know that -

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:22.085
"We are one with the Divine"

00:18:22.363 --> 00:18:26.140
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

00:18:27.185 --> 00:18:30.828
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.685
They are never worried, never upset,

00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:43.078
they are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:46.772
but they are in the present.

00:18:49.703 --> 00:18:55.595
When they are in the present, they are absolutely silent.

00:18:55.921 --> 00:19:01.889
If there is any problem, or anything happens to them,

00:19:02.492 --> 00:19:08.177
they immediately go into thoughtless awareness.

00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:12.645
That is what their capacity is.

00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:18.756
To become a guru you have to develop that personality.

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:23.031
Not to be bound by anything.

00:19:23.232 --> 00:19:26.007
Now I'll tell you my own example.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:31.167
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

00:19:32.888 --> 00:19:35.864
Once I was going to America -

00:19:36.126 --> 00:19:40.134
because if you are sure the Divine has plans for you,

00:19:40.436 --> 00:19:42.298
you are not bothered,

00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:45.999
the Divine is looking after you, so why to bother --

00:19:46.277 --> 00:19:49.443
I was going to America and one child fell down.

00:19:49.644 --> 00:19:52.849
I was just about to get up and go -

00:19:53.143 --> 00:19:56.929
and broke her arm.

00:19:57.421 --> 00:20:02.727
And when I saw the child I said "All right, I'll put that child right".

00:20:02.973 --> 00:20:07.742
But, they said, "You are going to America!" 
I said, "I'll go in any case!

00:20:08.035 --> 00:20:11.717
"So I cured the child, it took about half an hour,

00:20:11.955 --> 00:20:15.400
and then I came out "All right, let's go to the airport".

00:20:15.654 --> 00:20:20.519
They said, "Mother you are very late". I said, "I'm never late.

00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:22.675
Let's go!".

00:20:22.876 --> 00:20:26.360
We went there to the airport,

00:20:26.561 --> 00:20:30.487
and the plane by which I was going was out of order,

00:20:30.757 --> 00:20:33.802
so there was another plane going to Washington not to New York,

00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:37.894
and I wanted to go to Washington only!

00:20:38.648 --> 00:20:42.378
So just imagine how things work out,

00:20:43.362 --> 00:20:49.052
and we call them 'Sahaja'. It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

00:20:58.483 --> 00:21:02.372
That means it's effortless.

00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:08.705
But first of all your personality should be such

00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:16.200
that your devotion

00:21:16.597 --> 00:21:18.800
is so great

00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:24.971
that Divine is compelled to look after you...

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.645
compelled to look after you!

00:21:33.719 --> 00:21:39.632
You have to understand that Divine force is around you,

00:21:41.481 --> 00:21:45.252
and this Divine force is

00:21:46.085 --> 00:21:50.696
absolute guarantee for your safety.

00:21:50.982 --> 00:21:55.196
For everything that you want to do.

00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:01.878
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:05.402
You can become also very powerful!

00:22:05.603 --> 00:22:11.555
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine work,

00:22:11.904 --> 00:22:14.956
you will also have all the powers

00:22:15.157 --> 00:22:21.077
and the Divine will provide all the necessary work

00:22:22.117 --> 00:22:26.875
that you want to do, necessary time you have to have.

00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:32.065
Everything is provided by the Divine.

00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:36.002
But the compassion,

00:22:36.248 --> 00:22:41.010
when it extends from other people to God,

00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:46.806
or to Divine person or to your guru,

00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:53.387
then it becomes very easy to live,

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:59.126
very simple to live, no complications,

00:22:59.341 --> 00:23:01.713
everything is sorted out,

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:06.214
and you are not bothered about anything.

00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:11.975
You just close your eyes and things work out.

00:23:13.301 --> 00:23:19.057
Everything works out as if that's your will,

00:23:19.258 --> 00:23:24.361
but you don't have to will it, don't have to think about it,

00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:28.937
it just works out, but Divine looks after everything.

00:23:29.138 --> 00:23:31.241
It looks after your comfort,

00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:37.407
looks after your health, everything.

00:23:37.963 --> 00:23:42.750
And this Divine help,

00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:47.790
you do not seek, you do not ask for,

00:23:48.075 --> 00:23:50.785
but you are a personality

00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.737
for which the Divine is responsible.

00:23:55.959 --> 00:24:01.518
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

00:24:01.764 --> 00:24:06.804
And it knows what is good for you and what is not.

00:24:07.534 --> 00:24:12.559
It's an example, I can give many where I,

00:24:12.765 --> 00:24:17.717
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to meet me,

00:24:18.035 --> 00:24:24.008
and people told me "Mother, he's very negative", He will never come,

00:24:24.341 --> 00:24:26.230
he'll never come.

00:24:26.444 --> 00:24:31.782
All positive things will happen, and if a negative things take place,

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.635
then you will use your compassion.

00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:38.762
If it is negative you'll use your compassion

00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:41.468
and you'll solve the problem.

00:24:41.777 --> 00:24:45.886
You can solve the problems of your own,

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:50.506
of your surroundings, of your community.

00:24:51.712 --> 00:24:55.562
So now you have got your Self realisation.

00:24:55.824 --> 00:24:59.574
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:04.058
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:07.584
that they don't meditate.

00:25:08.092 --> 00:25:11.743
That they are not looking after themselves,

00:25:11.973 --> 00:25:14.105
they are not realised souls,

00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:17.965
and that's why many men want to divorce them

00:25:18.203 --> 00:25:23.875
because they think these women are good for nothing,

00:25:24.153 --> 00:25:30.034
and some men also are like that.

00:25:31.082 --> 00:25:36.988
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,

00:25:37.512 --> 00:25:40.850
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion

00:25:41.051 --> 00:25:47.027
you should win over the partner of your life.

00:25:48.455 --> 00:25:53.057
After all men are much more busy than women are.

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:58.712
But women indulge into so many other things.

00:25:58.954 --> 00:26:04.923
They have to look after their family, their children, their everything.

00:26:05.558 --> 00:26:11.510
And their mind is involved into all such mundane things

00:26:11.947 --> 00:26:15.275
that they have no time to meditate.

00:26:15.743 --> 00:26:18.419
Without meditation you cannot rise.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.345
You have to meditate.

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:25.561
People think that: "Now we have got realisation, so it's all right". No!

00:26:25.807 --> 00:26:28.309
Every day you must meditate

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.573
because that's the cleansing that takes place.

00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:37.238
With the cleansing you understand.

00:26:37.643 --> 00:26:42.960
You understand what is needed

00:26:43.161 --> 00:26:46.918
and what is not needed, you are cleansed out.

00:26:47.119 --> 00:26:48.819
That is done by Divine.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.988
But you must religiously meditate.

00:27:00.878 --> 00:27:06.308
Gradually you will find your meditation will become very deep.

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:10.283
You will become very, very deep

00:27:10.498 --> 00:27:14.648
and your powers will start showing.

00:27:19.739 --> 00:27:25.517
When you are anywhere, negativity will run away.

00:27:25.954 --> 00:27:30.943
All sorts of problems can be solved.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.544
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:42.381
Whatever is your desire to help others

00:27:42.618 --> 00:27:46.514
or give to someone, you just get it.

00:27:46.809 --> 00:27:50.777
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:56.433
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes

00:27:56.634 --> 00:28:01.026
every evening and morning about 5 minutes.

00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:07.343
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

00:28:07.612 --> 00:28:13.601
I have seen some people here, such bhakti, such devotion,

00:28:14.434 --> 00:28:18.957
which is shraddha - is higher than bhakti -

00:28:19.195 --> 00:28:24.004
that it becomes part and parcel of your being.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:29.592
It just envelops you completely.

00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:34.944
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:38.610
It works so many miracles.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.395
It's true some people were cured

00:28:41.596 --> 00:28:46.246
only thinking of me, is a fact.

00:28:46.664 --> 00:28:51.545
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha of that level,

00:28:51.791 --> 00:28:56.156
but that means that they have to develop shraddha.

00:28:56.394 --> 00:28:58.534
Now how to develop a shraddha,

00:28:58.735 --> 00:29:03.711
is a natural light of the Spirit.

00:29:05.707 --> 00:29:10.929
Because people are trying very hard

00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:15.190
to develop shraddha,

00:29:15.429 --> 00:29:20.850
but shraddha cannot be developed by mental activity,

00:29:21.175 --> 00:29:26.413
by any activity, but meditation of silence.

00:29:26.738 --> 00:29:32.414
If you do the meditation - I have always told you to do meditation.

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:34.654
I immediately know a person

00:29:34.855 --> 00:29:38.551
who has been meditating and who has not been.

00:29:38.765 --> 00:29:41.312
They'll come to my puja, all right,

00:29:41.542 --> 00:29:45.447
and they'll talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:45.709 --> 00:29:50.256
they'll go out and do it for popularity.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.349
Many people are like that.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.775
They go out and for popularity they work it out.

00:29:56.989 --> 00:30:02.974
But inside they have not yet traced their own Self.

00:30:04.315 --> 00:30:10.258
So at this development stage you should be encouraged,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.584
and should be understood that you can reach that state very easily

00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:22.154
through meditation and introspection.

00:30:22.472 --> 00:30:28.436
With introspection you will develop a new quality of understanding

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:34.790
that you will find solutions to things.

00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:41.703
That is another quality a person who is a realised soul has.

00:30:41.925 --> 00:30:47.901
It can find solutions to all your problems.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:54.446
It can, he can suggest what is the way

00:30:54.647 --> 00:30:58.877
you can be helped.

00:31:00.202 --> 00:31:05.968
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha develops.

00:31:06.238 --> 00:31:08.341
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:08.556 --> 00:31:10.824
you may be doing all kinds of things,

00:31:11.024 --> 00:31:16.214
but unless and until you have shraddha,

00:31:16.454 --> 00:31:18.881
you cannot rise.

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:23.458
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within you,

00:31:23.696 --> 00:31:29.648
I should say, which spreads like gentle fire

00:31:30.735 --> 00:31:35.688
which doesn't burn, which doesn't give heat,

00:31:35.934 --> 00:31:41.847
but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling within,

00:31:42.823 --> 00:31:46.980
which makes you understand.

00:31:47.258 --> 00:31:52.638
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi, never.

00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:58.428
I never listen to anybody who tells me something against sahaja yogi.

00:31:58.713 --> 00:32:04.642
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:09.601
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about it to the leader.

00:32:09.863 --> 00:32:14.189
But otherwise if one person comes and tells me this and this,

00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:20.366
I just tell that person, "You introspect yourself, it's not so".

00:32:20.646 --> 00:32:23.806
Finding faults with others

00:32:29.745 --> 00:32:33.286
is a common game all human beings play.

00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:35.839
They never see their own faults.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.855
What's the use of finding faults of others?

00:32:40.056 --> 00:32:45.645
By finding faults with others you're not going to be helped.

00:32:45.883 --> 00:32:50.213
Try to find faults within you, which you can cure,

00:32:50.414 --> 00:32:56.281
which you can help, which you can work it out.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:02.652
It's a responsibility you have, you must know to yourself

00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:06.397
that you better find out your defects

00:33:06.598 --> 00:33:10.183
and get them corrected.

00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:16.148
But some people are very proud of their fondness --

00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:20.484
they talk like this, "I like this, I like that".

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.807
What about the Spirit?

00:33:24.008 --> 00:33:28.965
You like this, you like that, then what about your Spirit?

00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:30.988
Does it like?

00:33:31.189 --> 00:33:36.339
Does it enjoy?

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.170
They'll go on saying, "I like this, I don't like this,

00:33:39.371 --> 00:33:43.456
I don't like that!" It's very common in the West.

00:33:43.657 --> 00:33:48.181
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful carpets for me.

00:33:48.412 --> 00:33:54.396
They are so thick that when I walk on them I little bit lose balance,

00:33:54.721 --> 00:33:58.103
but the love with which they are made,

00:33:58.397 --> 00:34:04.095
makes me so joyous, so happy,

00:34:04.421 --> 00:34:09.797
that you can't imagine, what I feel about them.

00:34:10.067 --> 00:34:15.210
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

00:34:15.424 --> 00:34:19.711
And when it starts stirring up,

00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:25.879
it doesn't torment you, it gives you beautiful --

00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:29.798
I don't know how to use words to express that --

00:34:29.998 --> 00:34:34.902
it's like a drizzle on your being,

00:34:35.148 --> 00:34:39.066
it's like a grace on your being.

00:34:39.267 --> 00:34:44.513
The love of other people enthrals you.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:51.410
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person

00:34:51.696 --> 00:34:54.902
who is very loving and kind,

00:34:55.172 --> 00:35:00.592
there is real friendship in that kind of relationship.

00:35:00.894 --> 00:35:06.358
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very wrong.

00:35:06.558 --> 00:35:11.809
And then talking to everyone that, "This is wrong with this person,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:17.954
he had done this, he had done that", is very, very wrong

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:22.329
and creating a collective feeling against the person --

00:35:22.535 --> 00:35:26.358
instead of helping that person.

00:35:26.628 --> 00:35:29.522
Always people are in trouble.

00:35:29.723 --> 00:35:33.030
Then collectively you must help that person.

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:37.191
Not talk ill of that person. May be some mistakes,

00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:42.805
but if you start talking against that person and saying,

00:35:43.006 --> 00:35:47.022
that 'This is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',

00:35:47.229 --> 00:35:50.670
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

00:35:50.871 --> 00:35:53.852
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see

00:35:54.053 --> 00:35:58.656
your own defects through introspection.

00:36:01.403 --> 00:36:06.800
Now many of you, I should say most of you, have got your realisation.

00:36:07.022 --> 00:36:09.713
You had the experience.

00:36:09.951 --> 00:36:15.227
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

00:36:16.179 --> 00:36:18.462
That knowledge you should acquire

00:36:18.663 --> 00:36:24.129
and verify whether that knowledge is really there or not.

00:36:28.207 --> 00:36:31.493
Like in America,

00:36:31.944 --> 00:36:37.849
in the NIH, which is an Institute for Health,

00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:43.652
they wanted to test a sahaja yogi and there were doctors.

00:36:43.853 --> 00:36:46.151
And one doctor came forward and said,

00:36:46.352 --> 00:36:51.440
"All right, tell me on your vibration, what's wrong with me".

00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:57.023
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with your heart".

00:36:57.277 --> 00:36:59.237
He said, "It's correct".

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:05.419
Because he has had a bypass only one month back

00:37:06.626 --> 00:37:09.383
and he was out of hospital.

00:37:09.636 --> 00:37:13.213
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

00:37:13.414 --> 00:37:18.960
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient half way.

00:37:19.246 --> 00:37:22.603
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a person,

00:37:22.817 --> 00:37:25.579
just by feeling the vibration.

00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:30.976
And they have given us such a good attention,

00:37:31.177 --> 00:37:36.446
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their hospitals.

00:37:41.716 --> 00:37:46.269
So you should also testify yourself,

00:37:46.477 --> 00:37:51.716
examine yourself and find out about yourself,  what are you?

00:37:55.319 --> 00:38:01.280
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,

00:38:01.709 --> 00:38:06.232
she knows everything, she knows about her husband,

00:38:06.447 --> 00:38:10.335
what's wrong with him

00:38:21.439 --> 00:38:26.089
and she doesn't tell him.

00:38:26.693 --> 00:38:29.937
She tolerates,

00:38:30.138 --> 00:38:33.312
she doesn't complain, she doesn't ask for anything,

00:38:33.598 --> 00:38:35.558
she just tolerates.

00:38:35.812 --> 00:38:40.634
And this tolerance convinces the husband

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.872
that she's a higher personality than himself.

00:38:46.128 --> 00:38:49.826
He may be anything, but he then understands

00:38:50.072 --> 00:38:55.673
that this is what she has achieved, a great personality.

00:38:56.659 --> 00:39:02.353
We have so many imperfections, especially morally, in the West,

00:39:02.554 --> 00:39:08.131
people are really, I tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

00:39:09.591 --> 00:39:11.604
The things that people do here

00:39:11.805 --> 00:39:17.083
never come into the minds of people who are not developed.

00:39:17.352 --> 00:39:22.818
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:29.004
all kinds of vagabond temperament,

00:39:29.337 --> 00:39:34.940
and they think they are very free and they can go about and enjoy.

00:39:35.551 --> 00:39:41.530
This style is very common,

00:39:42.863 --> 00:39:47.363
but you just judge yourself. Are you one of these type?

00:39:47.564 --> 00:39:53.334
Or are you one of the people who are higher than you in their ascent.

00:39:56.048 --> 00:39:58.479
It's a process, I must confess.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.187
It is not just that you get to that point.

00:40:03.664 --> 00:40:06.351
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis

00:40:06.552 --> 00:40:09.409
are better than very old sahaja yogis,

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:15.512
but because they had a very strong desire.

00:40:16.427 --> 00:40:18.361
What are we seeking?

00:40:18.562 --> 00:40:22.507
We should understand why we were seeking --

00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:26.625
because we wanted to know ourselves.

00:40:26.895 --> 00:40:30.276
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,

00:40:30.477 --> 00:40:33.429
and we did not know, so we seek.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.183
We seek. We do all kinds of things,

00:40:36.384 --> 00:40:39.812
I mean all wrong things also in the name of seeking.

00:40:40.463 --> 00:40:45.904
But it is this seeking

00:40:46.104 --> 00:40:49.230
brings you to Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:49.453 --> 00:40:53.024
Then you have to get your Self realisation,

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:56.124
which is very easy through Kundalini.

00:40:56.878 --> 00:41:00.812
Kundalini works out most of the things, most of the things.

00:41:01.013 --> 00:41:04.354
Like somebody told me that overnight

00:41:05.044 --> 00:41:10.417
she gave up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

00:41:11.725 --> 00:41:15.238
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:18.191
But just overnight she gave up,

00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:22.046
and she said, "I was very particular about my hair dress

00:41:22.247 --> 00:41:25.911
and I used to make my hair dress in a different manner,

00:41:26.112 --> 00:41:27.708
going to the hairdressers,

00:41:27.909 --> 00:41:31.467
spending so much time with the beautician, this, that".

00:41:31.668 --> 00:41:34.012
She said, "I gave it up".

00:41:34.273 --> 00:41:40.170
Also she said, "I used to wear dresses which were not very moral,

00:41:41.037 --> 00:41:43.941
then I started respecting my body

00:41:44.142 --> 00:41:47.560
and I started wearing proper dress".

00:41:48.396 --> 00:41:50.893
All this knowledge comes to you,

00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:56.853
spontaneously it is within you, because it is all your own.

00:41:57.054 --> 00:42:01.317
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:05.248
Guru's job is to guide people.

00:42:05.448 --> 00:42:09.771
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

00:42:09.993 --> 00:42:13.889
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

00:42:14.184 --> 00:42:16.342
That I have to tell you.

00:42:16.588 --> 00:42:22.525
There are so many collective disasters we have - all kinds of.

00:42:23.469 --> 00:42:27.668
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:32.744
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a river

00:42:32.945 --> 00:42:35.347
and so many disasters in the world

00:42:35.548 --> 00:42:40.223
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:44.311
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that, no doubt,

00:42:44.533 --> 00:42:49.586
but after being saved, what is your understanding?

00:42:49.818 --> 00:42:52.101
What do you know?

00:42:52.302 --> 00:42:55.875
Why these disasters are coming?

00:42:56.113 --> 00:43:00.605
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

00:43:00.835 --> 00:43:03.279
It has to become very collective.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.571
It has to spread much more, all over.

00:43:07.777 --> 00:43:11.894
It has to go to many people, which we don't do.

00:43:12.095 --> 00:43:16.250
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do it.

00:43:16.451 --> 00:43:21.329
But go all out! Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

00:43:21.583 --> 00:43:26.123
Of course the people went into wrong things.

00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:32.291
But how they worked and how intensively they did it.

00:43:33.918 --> 00:43:37.897
That intensity if you don't have,

00:43:38.111 --> 00:43:42.116
and if you do not completely dedicate

00:43:42.331 --> 00:43:45.735
to the spreading of Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:45.969 --> 00:43:51.108
then collective problems cannot be solved.

00:43:52.423 --> 00:43:55.200
You are busy with your daily mundane things,

00:43:55.401 --> 00:43:57.494
and your other jobs and everything.

00:43:57.701 --> 00:44:01.256
It's all right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

00:44:01.486 --> 00:44:07.402
But you should have your attention more

00:44:08.267 --> 00:44:13.177
on to this side of life that -

00:44:13.378 --> 00:44:17.526
'What are we doing for the collective? Are we talking about it?

00:44:17.727 --> 00:44:19.486
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:19.687 --> 00:44:24.346
Are we making people know about it?'

00:44:24.623 --> 00:44:28.203
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane

00:44:28.442 --> 00:44:33.981
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad vibrations.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:43.491
I put myself into bandhan,

00:44:43.737 --> 00:44:48.287
and I asked her what is she doing for her spirituality,

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:53.031
and she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

00:44:53.332 --> 00:44:57.067
"My God", I said. If these people spread out,

00:44:57.268 --> 00:45:01.789
 they are so spread out, they are so many!

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.327
So, what will happen?

00:45:03.528 --> 00:45:05.737
Disasters!

00:45:05.938 --> 00:45:08.501
They are such negative people,

00:45:08.702 --> 00:45:13.784
impossible that they can do any good to the world.

00:45:13.985 --> 00:45:18.529
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,

00:45:18.752 --> 00:45:23.162
how people are driven to them, how they take to them,

00:45:23.362 --> 00:45:25.638
and how they spread their message.

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:29.266
I have seen people singing on the road,

00:45:29.467 --> 00:45:31.888
singing the praise of their guru,

00:45:32.134 --> 00:45:36.570
and also wearing funny dresses --

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.237
we don't want that kind of a thing.

00:45:39.443 --> 00:45:43.297
But of course you have got the knowledge,

00:45:43.498 --> 00:45:45.932
of course you are realised souls.

00:45:46.133 --> 00:45:50.233
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is the point.

00:45:50.463 --> 00:45:55.423
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...

00:45:55.939 --> 00:45:58.193
...everywhere.

00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:02.753
For example, you wear a badge,

00:46:02.954 --> 00:46:06.641
then they will ask you, "What is this supposed to be?"

00:46:06.842 --> 00:46:10.776
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

00:46:10.977 --> 00:46:13.482
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

00:46:13.697 --> 00:46:16.670
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:16.871 --> 00:46:19.855
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:20.056 --> 00:46:23.704
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you do it,

00:46:23.905 --> 00:46:27.497
it won't become collective, and all the disasters,

00:46:27.698 --> 00:46:32.404
which are due to collective nonsense, you get it.

00:46:35.037 --> 00:46:38.134
You are saved from so many things.

00:46:38.396 --> 00:46:43.457
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja yogi it won't matter.

00:46:43.658 --> 00:46:48.337
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake

00:46:48.538 --> 00:46:50.885
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

00:46:51.086 --> 00:46:54.158
But why not save the whole world?

00:46:54.571 --> 00:46:57.560
Calamities after calamities are coming,

00:46:57.761 --> 00:47:02.973
and if you have compassion you must think of the people

00:47:03.174 --> 00:47:07.861
who can get into any calamity or into any trouble.

00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:13.567
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:17.980
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very collective.

00:47:18.227 --> 00:47:20.692
Now you are so many people here,

00:47:20.893 --> 00:47:26.731
you all can start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:28.627
Go everywhere.

00:47:28.841 --> 00:47:31.799
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.945
Sing the praise of the Divine,

00:47:36.199 --> 00:47:39.629
and you will save the whole world.

00:47:39.853 --> 00:47:43.203
It is not by saving some few people

00:47:43.404 --> 00:47:47.811
you can have the great Satya Yuga,

00:47:48.012 --> 00:47:50.886
but you have also to save this Mother Earth.

00:47:51.087 --> 00:47:54.282
You have to save the people who are in it.

00:47:54.483 --> 00:47:56.695
I mean, the way these people are,

00:47:56.896 --> 00:48:00.725
I have seen so many of them on the television.

00:48:00.956 --> 00:48:05.564
Shamelessly they are talking about something which they don't know.

00:48:05.765 --> 00:48:09.376
And they have thousands and thousands of people behind them.

00:48:09.577 --> 00:48:12.939
Not that the people are stupid.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.598
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,

00:48:16.799 --> 00:48:21.796
but these people who are false,

00:48:21.997 --> 00:48:25.502
or who are wrong, know how to entice them,

00:48:25.703 --> 00:48:28.976
how to capture them, how to talk to them.

00:48:29.177 --> 00:48:33.039
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:39.137
with a negative vibrations will run away.

00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:43.764
He will escape such a society, will not go near them,

00:48:43.978 --> 00:48:47.645
and will say, "Oh, very bad vibrations, we don't want!".

00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:50.564
So you have to be courageous

00:48:50.765 --> 00:48:55.874
and get into these places, talk to people and make it collective.

00:48:56.075 --> 00:49:01.851
Otherwise you cannot save this world from the wrath of God.

00:49:02.129 --> 00:49:04.960
God is wrathful, no doubt.

00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:08.515
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

00:49:08.716 --> 00:49:12.198
We have to save this Mother Earth.

00:49:12.399 --> 00:49:16.166
And for that you have to be prepared,

00:49:16.367 --> 00:49:20.753
you have to work it out, and whenever you get a chance

00:49:20.954 --> 00:49:23.356
you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:23.557 --> 00:49:27.159
Some people told me, "Mother, if you come then it will be All right."

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:32.899
Why? What's so much? .... you can be also like me.

00:49:33.106 --> 00:49:35.875
You can talk about it to people.

00:49:36.082 --> 00:49:38.719
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person

00:49:38.926 --> 00:49:42.994
and that time it was complete darkness everywhere.

00:49:43.195 --> 00:49:46.534
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,

00:49:46.735 --> 00:49:49.695
but it worked and it cleared.

00:49:49.896 --> 00:49:52.928
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,

00:49:53.129 --> 00:49:57.036
why not you people do the same and talk about it.

00:49:57.237 --> 00:50:00.833
Your behaviour, your style,

00:50:01.034 --> 00:50:06.065
everything will definitely impress them.

00:50:06.296 --> 00:50:10.651
One has to work it out in such a manner

00:50:10.852 --> 00:50:16.757
that you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

00:50:17.288 --> 00:50:20.484
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for everyone.

00:50:20.723 --> 00:50:24.529
So that all these calamities that are happening,

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.332
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

00:50:27.532 --> 00:50:31.378
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

00:50:31.578 --> 00:50:33.686
Because you are always saved.

00:50:33.887 --> 00:50:38.371
So all people who will be getting realisation will be saved.

00:50:38.572 --> 00:50:40.714
Why not talk openly about it

00:50:40.915 --> 00:50:45.667
telling people that if we do wrong, if we are immoral,

00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:51.234
if we are cheats, if we try to oppress others

00:50:51.434 --> 00:50:57.354
and we become so much a power of destruction

00:50:57.924 --> 00:51:03.639
then this collective

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.726
disasters will be there and I think we'll be responsible for that.

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.167
Everything you take up,

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:14.961
any subject you take up, you don't have to start an organisation

00:51:15.162 --> 00:51:16.477
to fight it.

00:51:16.678 --> 00:51:20.238
But only your power of convincing people

00:51:20.581 --> 00:51:25.182
and bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such a difference.

00:51:25.383 --> 00:51:29.854
I hope you will understand as a guru what you have to do.

00:51:30.458 --> 00:51:34.415
As a guru there are so many things

00:51:34.616 --> 00:51:38.454
and as your character, yesterday, as they showed

00:51:38.655 --> 00:51:43.391
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,

00:51:43.592 --> 00:51:48.229
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

00:51:48.467 --> 00:51:54.237
above jealousies, above talking loose.

00:51:54.832 --> 00:51:58.210
They are so great, they are the masters

00:51:58.411 --> 00:52:00.078
and they will be the masters

00:52:00.279 --> 00:52:04.948
and you will be the gurus if you try to do that.

00:52:05.149 --> 00:52:07.709
This is what you have to achieve.

00:52:07.963 --> 00:52:09.992
I know some have achieved it,

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:15.087
but most of you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

00:52:15.317 --> 00:52:18.500
May God Bless You All.
