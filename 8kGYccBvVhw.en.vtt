WEBVTT

00:15.850 --> 00:25.520
now what we can do is to today what

00:22.160 --> 00:28.099
should I tell you the practical side the

00:25.520 --> 00:30.800
meditation all right let's see what his

00:28.099 --> 00:33.489
meditation is what we have to do for a

00:30.800 --> 00:33.489
meditation

00:36.060 --> 00:42.600
the first thing we have got is the left

00:38.550 --> 00:46.490
side is the money shot

00:42.600 --> 00:51.660
is the power of your emotion all right

00:46.490 --> 00:54.420
now emotions are connected with your

00:51.660 --> 00:56.370
right side also rather say for example

00:54.420 --> 00:58.590
if you are emotionally disturbed just

00:56.370 --> 01:02.840
now we got disturbed

00:58.590 --> 01:08.220
so our schwarz our breathing also

01:02.840 --> 01:11.790
increased and we felt the whole body was

01:08.220 --> 01:16.080
sort of reacting and the we were feeling

01:11.790 --> 01:17.970
the reaction of the prana right side

01:16.080 --> 01:21.360
also that it was trying to express

01:17.970 --> 01:24.570
itself like we started the tears is the

01:21.360 --> 01:27.210
water element and all that came in and

01:24.570 --> 01:34.009
the whole emotion was so much boring out

01:27.210 --> 01:36.930
and with that our prana was also

01:34.009 --> 01:40.640
involved say for example if you're

01:36.930 --> 01:43.590
frightened if you are frightened

01:40.640 --> 01:46.890
it's alright if you are frightened too

01:43.590 --> 01:48.690
much then what happens if you are

01:46.890 --> 01:52.080
frightened then also you get your

01:48.690 --> 01:56.670
breathing very fast in it so it is

01:52.080 --> 01:58.650
connected yes coming them so it is

01:56.670 --> 02:02.400
connected if you are frightened it is

01:58.650 --> 02:09.600
connected with your prana in your

02:02.400 --> 02:11.820
breathing and your whole system is

02:09.600 --> 02:15.750
connected with your emotions physical

02:11.820 --> 02:18.150
system if you cry too much or if you

02:15.750 --> 02:20.400
weep too much or if you are a sad person

02:18.150 --> 02:22.019
that shows on your face your wish you

02:20.400 --> 02:24.810
teach a cross for sure but not only

02:22.019 --> 02:26.340
another but also we should be then also

02:24.810 --> 02:31.820
your agua

02:26.340 --> 02:34.019
so all the chakras reflect the left side

02:31.820 --> 02:36.420
in such a way that physical

02:34.019 --> 02:40.860
manifestation is also so it proves that

02:36.420 --> 02:45.720
both are very much connected so - we

02:40.860 --> 02:47.110
have to somehow other resolve these two

02:45.720 --> 02:51.220
sides within

02:47.110 --> 02:52.990
the left and right side because if you

02:51.220 --> 02:55.360
do not dissolve it you are left half way

02:52.990 --> 02:57.670
here so you have to dissolve these two

02:55.360 --> 02:59.430
things and to dissolve these what should

02:57.670 --> 03:05.980
we do

02:59.430 --> 03:08.190
what can we do in meditation can you

03:05.980 --> 03:08.190
suggest

03:10.540 --> 03:19.390
say we have got prana and mana now prana

03:14.650 --> 03:21.580
represents the right side and the mana

03:19.390 --> 03:24.790
Shakti is the left side all right

03:21.580 --> 03:28.720
these two have to be dissolved layer

03:24.790 --> 03:30.220
means dissolved now how do we do it to

03:28.720 --> 03:35.110
dissolve these two things they are

03:30.220 --> 03:38.010
connected with each other after

03:35.110 --> 03:38.010
realization

03:49.280 --> 03:53.300
so before meditation we give ourselves a

03:52.640 --> 03:56.780
bad

03:53.300 --> 03:58.850
all right beside is more recently at the

03:56.780 --> 04:01.490
time supposing you are emotionally that

03:58.850 --> 04:04.430
time mister then you put your right to

04:01.490 --> 04:06.320
the left if you are that time disturbed

04:04.430 --> 04:10.880
on the left side

04:06.320 --> 04:12.950
I mean disturbed in the sense that if

04:10.880 --> 04:15.650
your left side is frozen then you raise

04:12.950 --> 04:18.260
your left side I'll give you our self

04:15.650 --> 04:22.340
for balance before meditation now let us

04:18.260 --> 04:24.970
see this side is less first of all put

04:22.340 --> 04:24.970
your hands like this

04:25.030 --> 04:33.250
are you alright

04:27.100 --> 04:33.250
waiting coolbreeze waiting

04:46.039 --> 04:51.120
better

04:47.889 --> 04:51.120
are you getting in this

04:56.400 --> 04:59.060
No

04:59.599 --> 05:10.490
something moving always coming now I'm

05:04.429 --> 05:22.279
still cool freeze it then it's good

05:10.490 --> 05:26.409
breeze in your hat powerfully so once

05:22.279 --> 05:29.990
you have given yourself a balance then

05:26.409 --> 05:35.300
the best thing is to pay attention to

05:29.990 --> 05:40.309
your emotions to manage to watch them

05:35.300 --> 05:44.059
you can enlighten your emotions by

05:40.309 --> 05:48.009
thinking of your mother right

05:44.059 --> 05:50.539
just enlightened yes she will falter for

05:48.009 --> 05:55.809
whatever are the problems in the manner

05:50.539 --> 06:03.619
all right so once you get connected with

05:55.809 --> 06:08.139
those emotions and you start looking at

06:03.619 --> 06:08.139
them in your meditation

06:08.350 --> 06:18.500
you will see these emotions are rising

06:12.460 --> 06:21.620
within you and if you try to put these

06:18.500 --> 06:25.100
emotions on your mother as I said the

06:21.620 --> 06:29.090
lotus feet of your mother they will

06:25.100 --> 06:38.060
start also resolving those emotions and

06:29.090 --> 06:41.140
they'll become sort of expanded expanses

06:38.060 --> 06:44.210
you will extend that in such a way that

06:41.140 --> 06:47.450
you will feel you are in control this

06:44.210 --> 06:50.420
emotion in control of them and by that

06:47.450 --> 06:52.790
controlling those emotions your emotions

06:50.420 --> 06:57.610
which are expanded enlightened are

06:52.790 --> 07:03.950
powerful and these emotions when you

06:57.610 --> 07:08.630
feel that way then the cause of those

07:03.950 --> 07:10.910
emotions can be solved for example just

07:08.630 --> 07:14.990
now you got emotionally stirred up

07:10.910 --> 07:18.860
because I talked about say these

07:14.990 --> 07:22.040
children naturally anybody would be now

07:18.860 --> 07:24.710
when you are stirred up with that you

07:22.040 --> 07:27.590
put that problem of those feelings that

07:24.710 --> 07:29.510
are rising in you that those waves or

07:27.590 --> 07:35.300
feelings that are coming at the lotus

07:29.510 --> 07:38.570
feet of you so they get touched say by

07:35.300 --> 07:41.750
that power you can say then these

07:38.570 --> 07:44.720
emotions become enlightened and when

07:41.750 --> 07:49.010
these emotions become enlightened they

07:44.720 --> 07:51.770
have a power to solve the problem do you

07:49.010 --> 07:54.500
see the path as if they have reached the

07:51.770 --> 07:58.669
shore where they got the light and this

07:54.500 --> 08:01.910
problem can resolve because now you are

07:58.669 --> 08:04.300
not in an individual self you are in the

08:01.910 --> 08:06.410
expanse you are in the summer stream and

08:04.300 --> 08:07.850
because you have entered into that

08:06.410 --> 08:09.919
position that's why you have got these

08:07.850 --> 08:12.020
powers of entering to another person's

08:09.919 --> 08:14.450
body to see the vibrations of another

08:12.020 --> 08:17.620
person to raise the Kundalini

08:14.450 --> 08:17.620
otherwise we put

08:17.940 --> 08:23.030
so for you it is very easy to do it

08:20.400 --> 08:26.640
because I am also sitting here in person

08:23.030 --> 08:29.640
so easy to put these emotions just there

08:26.640 --> 08:32.340
so that they get enlightened and your

08:29.640 --> 08:34.460
wish is fulfilled because emotions are

08:32.340 --> 08:41.460
not Reaper fishing

08:34.460 --> 08:44.099
these are unfulfilled wishes now how

08:41.460 --> 08:47.910
they do it otherwise it also this way

08:44.099 --> 08:53.540
that you take up these emotions and put

08:47.910 --> 09:00.060
them so that is these emotions are

08:53.540 --> 09:06.120
actually the left side as I said if the

09:00.060 --> 09:09.720
desire so the desire is taken any desire

09:06.120 --> 09:14.160
and is put in the product now how do you

09:09.720 --> 09:16.950
put it on the planner that you control

09:14.160 --> 09:20.220
your pride that's why they do pranayama

09:16.950 --> 09:23.160
see like you sit down now

09:20.220 --> 09:24.600
very comfortably now you have a desire

09:23.160 --> 09:27.930
to put your attention to that attention

09:24.600 --> 09:37.770
is very important see now this attention

09:27.930 --> 09:41.640
is to be put on to the product so the

09:37.770 --> 09:43.560
emotions are there and then bring those

09:41.640 --> 09:49.650
emotions and put them into your

09:43.560 --> 09:52.980
attention means they are now you are

09:49.650 --> 10:00.570
aware of them now what you do is to

09:52.980 --> 10:05.930
watch your breathing see now try to

10:00.570 --> 10:05.930
reduce your breathing it is it

10:06.730 --> 10:17.769
in the sense that you have read out meat

10:13.939 --> 10:17.769
for a while they will behave

10:20.760 --> 10:26.310
for a long time when you breathe out so

10:25.170 --> 10:28.950
in one minute

10:26.310 --> 10:33.600
your breathing will be less than normal

10:28.950 --> 10:35.790
all right try that breathe in now with

10:33.600 --> 10:38.040
the emotion keep the attention on the

10:35.790 --> 10:40.400
emotions you see so that the connection

10:38.040 --> 10:40.400
is established

11:09.150 --> 11:11.180
Oh

11:11.710 --> 11:16.680
better see to Kundalini Rises

11:19.930 --> 11:25.900
now when you are breathing to find that

11:22.960 --> 11:27.190
there is a space in between which you

11:25.900 --> 11:34.240
just leave it vacant

11:27.190 --> 11:36.630
breathe in now leave it vacant now

11:34.240 --> 11:36.630
breathe out

11:40.690 --> 11:43.950
or leave it vacant

11:47.520 --> 11:53.160
reading

11:50.140 --> 11:53.160
to be there

11:53.930 --> 11:57.010
then give it

11:59.370 --> 12:04.880
keep outside obligate

12:10.879 --> 12:17.769
now start breathing in such a way that

12:13.809 --> 12:17.769
you stop your breathing

12:37.650 --> 12:45.270
attention should be on the heart or

12:40.900 --> 12:45.270
could be on the emotions

12:52.700 --> 12:55.330
better

12:59.270 --> 13:06.310
keep the breathing inside for a while

13:02.080 --> 13:08.690
bring it out then outside for a while

13:06.310 --> 13:11.770
then again then you'll find that for a

13:08.690 --> 13:11.770
while you will not drink

13:18.279 --> 13:29.100
you see you settle down the layer takes

13:23.949 --> 13:35.829
place between your prana and Yoruba now

13:29.100 --> 13:38.889
both the Shakti's becomes one now at

13:35.829 --> 13:42.480
this stage when you are silent now you

13:38.889 --> 13:42.480
think of arrangement

13:47.430 --> 13:50.180
clock

13:50.930 --> 13:56.720
just think of it is lust is no more than

13:53.320 --> 14:00.560
so what is happening actually that this

13:56.720 --> 14:04.390
layer the attention goes into the

14:00.560 --> 14:04.390
intellects and enlightens the England

14:17.910 --> 14:21.720
see the thought is not there try to find

14:19.980 --> 14:24.180
your intellect within yourself now see

14:21.720 --> 14:26.420
see where is my intellect try to fight

14:24.180 --> 14:26.420
it

14:30.700 --> 14:40.720
but there it's not working again try it

14:37.110 --> 14:44.790
it is working but it has become this

14:40.720 --> 14:44.790
emerged has become the collective now

14:58.330 --> 15:13.150
enough did you follow that there's no

15:06.370 --> 15:15.040
thought this exercise will give you this

15:13.150 --> 15:18.510
thoughtless awareness establishment of

15:15.040 --> 15:18.510
thoughtless action there is no fun

15:19.710 --> 15:26.400
so the second lesson alright maybe
