00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:25.520
now what we can do is to today what

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.099
should I tell you the practical side the

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.800
meditation all right let's see what his

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.489
meditation is what we have to do for a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.489
meditation

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.600
the first thing we have got is the left

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.490
side is the money shot

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.660
is the power of your emotion all right

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:54.420
now emotions are connected with your

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.370
right side also rather say for example

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.590
if you are emotionally disturbed just

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.840
now we got disturbed

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:08.220
so our schwarz our breathing also

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.790
increased and we felt the whole body was

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.080
sort of reacting and the we were feeling

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.970
the reaction of the prana right side

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.360
also that it was trying to express

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.570
itself like we started the tears is the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.210
water element and all that came in and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:34.009
the whole emotion was so much boring out

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.930
and with that our prana was also

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.640
involved say for example if you're

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.590
frightened if you are frightened

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.890
it's alright if you are frightened too

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.690
much then what happens if you are

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.080
frightened then also you get your

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.670
breathing very fast in it so it is

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.650
connected yes coming them so it is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.400
connected if you are frightened it is

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:09.600
connected with your prana in your

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.820
breathing and your whole system is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.750
connected with your emotions physical

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.150
system if you cry too much or if you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.400
weep too much or if you are a sad person

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.019
that shows on your face your wish you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.810
teach a cross for sure but not only

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.340
another but also we should be then also

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.820
your agua

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.019
so all the chakras reflect the left side

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.420
in such a way that physical

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.860
manifestation is also so it proves that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:45.720
both are very much connected so - we

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.110
have to somehow other resolve these two

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.220
sides within

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.990
the left and right side because if you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.360
do not dissolve it you are left half way

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.670
here so you have to dissolve these two

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.430
things and to dissolve these what should

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.980
we do

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.190
what can we do in meditation can you

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.190
suggest

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.390
say we have got prana and mana now prana

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.580
represents the right side and the mana

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.790
Shakti is the left side all right

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.720
these two have to be dissolved layer

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.220
means dissolved now how do we do it to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.110
dissolve these two things they are

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:38.010
connected with each other after

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.010
realization

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.300
so before meditation we give ourselves a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.780
bad

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.850
all right beside is more recently at the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.490
time supposing you are emotionally that

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.430
time mister then you put your right to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.320
the left if you are that time disturbed

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.880
on the left side

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.950
I mean disturbed in the sense that if

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.650
your left side is frozen then you raise

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.260
your left side I'll give you our self

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.340
for balance before meditation now let us

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.970
see this side is less first of all put

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.970
your hands like this

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.250
are you alright

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.250
waiting coolbreeze waiting

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.120
better

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.120
are you getting in this

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.060
No

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:10.490
something moving always coming now I'm

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:22.279
still cool freeze it then it's good

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:26.409
breeze in your hat powerfully so once

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:29.990
you have given yourself a balance then

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:35.300
the best thing is to pay attention to

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:40.309
your emotions to manage to watch them

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.059
you can enlighten your emotions by

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:48.009
thinking of your mother right

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:50.539
just enlightened yes she will falter for

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:55.809
whatever are the problems in the manner

00:05:50.539 --> 00:06:03.619
all right so once you get connected with

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:08.139
those emotions and you start looking at

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:08.139
them in your meditation

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:18.500
you will see these emotions are rising

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:21.620
within you and if you try to put these

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.100
emotions on your mother as I said the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:29.090
lotus feet of your mother they will

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:38.060
start also resolving those emotions and

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:41.140
they'll become sort of expanded expanses

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.210
you will extend that in such a way that

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.450
you will feel you are in control this

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.420
emotion in control of them and by that

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.790
controlling those emotions your emotions

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:57.610
which are expanded enlightened are

00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:03.950
powerful and these emotions when you

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:08.630
feel that way then the cause of those

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.910
emotions can be solved for example just

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.990
now you got emotionally stirred up

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:18.860
because I talked about say these

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:22.040
children naturally anybody would be now

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.710
when you are stirred up with that you

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.590
put that problem of those feelings that

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.510
are rising in you that those waves or

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:35.300
feelings that are coming at the lotus

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:38.570
feet of you so they get touched say by

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.750
that power you can say then these

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:44.720
emotions become enlightened and when

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:49.010
these emotions become enlightened they

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.770
have a power to solve the problem do you

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:54.500
see the path as if they have reached the

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:58.669
shore where they got the light and this

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.910
problem can resolve because now you are

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:04.300
not in an individual self you are in the

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.410
expanse you are in the summer stream and

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.850
because you have entered into that

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.919
position that's why you have got these

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.020
powers of entering to another person's

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.450
body to see the vibrations of another

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.620
person to raise the Kundalini

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.620
otherwise we put

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.030
so for you it is very easy to do it

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.640
because I am also sitting here in person

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:29.640
so easy to put these emotions just there

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.340
so that they get enlightened and your

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.460
wish is fulfilled because emotions are

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:41.460
not Reaper fishing

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:44.099
these are unfulfilled wishes now how

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:47.910
they do it otherwise it also this way

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:53.540
that you take up these emotions and put

00:08:47.910 --> 00:09:00.060
them so that is these emotions are

00:08:53.540 --> 00:09:06.120
actually the left side as I said if the

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:09.720
desire so the desire is taken any desire

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:14.160
and is put in the product now how do you

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.950
put it on the planner that you control

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:20.220
your pride that's why they do pranayama

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:23.160
see like you sit down now

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.600
very comfortably now you have a desire

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.930
to put your attention to that attention

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:37.770
is very important see now this attention

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:41.640
is to be put on to the product so the

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:43.560
emotions are there and then bring those

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:49.650
emotions and put them into your

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:52.980
attention means they are now you are

00:09:49.650 --> 00:10:00.570
aware of them now what you do is to

00:09:52.980 --> 00:10:05.930
watch your breathing see now try to

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.930
reduce your breathing it is it

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:17.769
in the sense that you have read out meat

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:17.769
for a while they will behave

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.310
for a long time when you breathe out so

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.950
in one minute

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:33.600
your breathing will be less than normal

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:35.790
all right try that breathe in now with

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.040
the emotion keep the attention on the

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.400
emotions you see so that the connection

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.400
is established

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.180
Oh

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.680
better see to Kundalini Rises

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:25.900
now when you are breathing to find that

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.190
there is a space in between which you

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:34.240
just leave it vacant

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:36.630
breathe in now leave it vacant now

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.630
breathe out

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.950
or leave it vacant

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.160
reading

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.160
to be there

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.010
then give it

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:04.880
keep outside obligate

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:17.769
now start breathing in such a way that

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:17.769
you stop your breathing

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:45.270
attention should be on the heart or

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.270
could be on the emotions

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.330
better

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:06.310
keep the breathing inside for a while

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.690
bring it out then outside for a while

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.770
then again then you'll find that for a

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.770
while you will not drink

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:29.100
you see you settle down the layer takes

00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:35.829
place between your prana and Yoruba now

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:38.889
both the Shakti's becomes one now at

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:42.480
this stage when you are silent now you

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:42.480
think of arrangement

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.180
clock

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.720
just think of it is lust is no more than

00:13:53.320 --> 00:14:00.560
so what is happening actually that this

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:04.390
layer the attention goes into the

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.390
intellects and enlightens the England

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.720
see the thought is not there try to find

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.180
your intellect within yourself now see

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.420
see where is my intellect try to fight

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.420
it

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:40.720
but there it's not working again try it

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:44.790
it is working but it has become this

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.790
emerged has become the collective now

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:13.150
enough did you follow that there's no

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:15.040
thought this exercise will give you this

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:18.510
thoughtless awareness establishment of

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.510
thoughtless action there is no fun

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:26.400
so the second lesson alright maybe
