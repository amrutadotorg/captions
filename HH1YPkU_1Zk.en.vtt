00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.400
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:21.207
They had planned everything.

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:25.687
They had all the arrangements made

00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:28.358
and the sari was missing.

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:34.198
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:35.952
so now what to do?

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:40.334
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.545
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:45.879
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:48.857
otherwise we can have it later.

00:00:49.022 --> 00:00:52.920
But I was least disturbed,

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:56.065
least upset.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:01:00.517
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:04.143
But if you have a mental conception,

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:07.308
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:10.521
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:16.443
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:21.856
But that is what we cannot do.

00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:24.111
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:27.409
This is what it is.

00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:34.149
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:36.592
That’s one of the things.

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:40.429
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.086
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:49.682
because we make a mental projection.

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:52.082
Mentally we calculate something.

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:53.422
This has to be.

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:58.914
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:05.566
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:08.306
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:13.147
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.245
only about two o’clock.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:16.605
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:20.429
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:26.855
So this is how you become avyagra.

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:31.408
Vyagra means person who is worried.

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:34.798
The one who is not worried.

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:37.384
So we worry because of two things.

00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:45.490
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:50.410
Future doesn’t exist.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.036
If you have made up your mind

00:02:52.156 --> 00:02:53.801
that this should happen in the future,

00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:57.570
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.173
But you have not made any mental picture,

00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:03.491
you will see what comes on the scene.

00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:08.224
You’ll watch whatever appears.

00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:10.988
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.633
what’s going to happen.

00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:19.249
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.980
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.062
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

00:03:30.222 --> 00:03:32.281
and we are not having it.”

00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:34.107
So you are upset.

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:37.983
What difference does it make?

00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:43.322
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:45.618
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

00:03:45.738 --> 00:03:50.275
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:52.611
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:56.910
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:01.567
We really decorated ourselves well.

00:04:01.688 --> 00:04:03.365
We were all ready for the puja,

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:05.138
we were sitting here for the puja,

00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:08.648
and now what has happened!

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:15.242
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.065
I knew what was coming.

00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:29.961
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:32.384
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:34.477
I’m busy with Myself.

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:39.932
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:48.667
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:52.632
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:54.939
In India people come.

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.092
They keep so much money for buying things.

00:04:58.212 --> 00:05:01.911
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

00:05:02.124 --> 00:05:03.973
what you call traders.

00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:05.999
The customs are so kind, I mean

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:08.198
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

00:05:08.318 --> 00:05:10.629
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:12.657
And then they have a mental picture,

00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:17.379
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.210
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.507
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.312
So then they might go to spend some money.

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:31.171
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:35.859
It has happened with all of you.

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.684
So they go and buy something.

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:41.707
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

00:05:41.827 --> 00:05:45.220
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.417
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

00:05:48.537 --> 00:05:50.338
How many pounds you paid for that?

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:54.204
Gavin: Forty pounds.

00:05:54.324 --> 00:05:56.359
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.009
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:01.984
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:06.778
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

00:06:06.898 --> 00:06:09.249
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:14.424
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

00:06:14.544 --> 00:06:17.111
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:19.572
They thought they’ve bought something great.

00:06:19.692 --> 00:06:23.004
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

00:06:23.124 --> 00:06:24.786
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:26.683
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.670
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.642
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

00:06:37.788 --> 00:06:40.166
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:43.519
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.920
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.464
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:51.585
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

00:06:51.705 --> 00:06:54.476
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:57.252
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

00:06:57.372 --> 00:06:58.344
He said, “What is the price?”

00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:01.987
I said, “Forty pounds.”

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.062
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

00:07:06.182 --> 00:07:08.688
And he bought it for forty pounds.

00:07:08.808 --> 00:07:11.214
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

00:07:11.334 --> 00:07:14.984
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:20.653
And I found it out that,

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:25.595
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.338
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:35.550
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.278
And if you start making it flexible then

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.883
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.487
very early. Now he’s different.

00:07:44.607 --> 00:07:47.554
So if you become flexible,

00:07:47.674 --> 00:07:51.450
then what happens you see the joy of it.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.145
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:58.448
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

00:07:58.568 --> 00:08:01.296
And you can never enjoy it,

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:06.342
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:08.738
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

00:08:08.858 --> 00:08:11.580
You see it is all your own creation.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.613
The mental projection is your creation,

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:21.556
and also the destruction is your creation.

00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:26.225
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

00:08:27.755 --> 00:08:30.660
But who does that is Mahamaya,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.565
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:38.810
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.792
I have to go to Birmingham.

00:08:40.912 --> 00:08:46.237
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

00:08:46.357 --> 00:08:47.734
After some time you will find

00:08:47.854 --> 00:08:51.032
that it’s impossible to do something,

00:08:51.152 --> 00:08:54.583
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:56.460
Because whenever you will try to do something,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.262
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:05.118
If not, then it will make you realize

00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:08.365
what is important, what you’ve missed.

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:13.839
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:17.120
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.351
What to do? Now where to go?”

00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:26.067
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:28.719
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:32.536
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:38.616
for days together. I just see that there.

00:09:41.662 --> 00:09:50.071
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

00:09:51.646 --> 00:09:54.833
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

00:09:54.953 --> 00:09:57.405
at any cost.

00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:03.275
Then that acts as a guide

00:10:03.816 --> 00:10:09.867
and you understand the flexibility

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:13.856
of all these worldly, transitory things.

00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:16.849
They are all changeable,

00:10:16.969 --> 00:10:21.589
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:27.931
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:32.231
which is very important subject.

00:10:34.286 --> 00:10:38.585
I think I have talked about it many a times.

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:42.878
But in the West I must say,

00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:50.565
because of our wrong attitudes

00:10:54.348 --> 00:11:00.552
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:04.499
of other people who are very dominating,

00:11:05.435 --> 00:11:11.739
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:17.758
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:22.797
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:26.331
and has sustained itself,

00:11:26.943 --> 00:11:32.313
we must know that we can always fall a trap

00:11:32.433 --> 00:11:41.729
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

00:11:44.184 --> 00:11:47.961
It's a very serious matter

00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:54.475
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

00:11:54.637 --> 00:11:59.041
and we have created pathways

00:11:59.161 --> 00:12:02.490
into which our attention can go

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.217
if we are not very careful.

00:12:07.765 --> 00:12:11.538
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

00:12:11.658 --> 00:12:15.131
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:21.256
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:24.668
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

00:12:24.795 --> 00:12:28.913
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:39.982
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

00:12:40.102 --> 00:12:42.854
sin against the Mother,

00:12:45.277 --> 00:12:51.133
it's a secretive action

00:12:51.253 --> 00:12:55.180
that's only between you and yourself.

00:12:55.998 --> 00:13:01.162
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.972
Nobody knows what you are going to do

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:13.597
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.875
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

00:13:18.995 --> 00:13:22.300
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.625
To be very frank with you,

00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:30.935
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

00:13:31.055 --> 00:13:38.822
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:46.501
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

00:13:47.306 --> 00:13:48.899
It is not bothered.

00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:53.347
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:57.052
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

00:13:57.172 --> 00:13:59.276
that's the action it plays all the time.

00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:03.359
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

00:14:03.479 --> 00:14:05.926
I mean the person is very close to Me,

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.146
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:11.055
But still I can?

00:14:11.175 --> 00:14:15.729
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

00:14:15.849 --> 00:14:19.202
immediately I can feel it.

00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:25.484
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

00:14:25.604 --> 00:14:29.285
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

00:14:29.405 --> 00:14:31.742
do what you like.

00:14:34.198 --> 00:14:38.826
Now for people who are Indian,

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:42.611
who have respected their Mooladharas,

00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:45.552
there are so many methods and ways given

00:14:45.672 --> 00:14:52.735
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

00:14:52.855 --> 00:14:56.602
But that won't work out with the Western people,

00:14:56.722 --> 00:15:00.342
because it's a damaged one.

00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:04.209
It's one which is a shattered one,

00:15:04.329 --> 00:15:07.885
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

00:15:08.005 --> 00:15:12.082
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:15.856
the left side.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:23.264
So, even you may not talk in that way,

00:15:23.384 --> 00:15:28.498
but your mind is still in that realm.

00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:33.084
And you still think on that realm.

00:15:33.204 --> 00:15:38.168
Even mentally, you are in it.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:43.259
Or you are seeing things,

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:46.276
wanting to see such things,

00:15:46.396 --> 00:15:49.714
wanting to enjoy such things.

00:15:49.834 --> 00:15:53.994
That lurking attraction is still there,

00:15:54.114 --> 00:15:57.314
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

00:15:58.998 --> 00:16:04.727
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:09.575
I would not say the same to the people from India.

00:16:10.978 --> 00:16:15.154
So now we have to work out much harder.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:21.701
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:27.919
And it is more a mental activity.

00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:34.515
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

00:16:34.635 --> 00:16:37.441
You have to watch your mind.

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:42.214
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:49.918
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.271
Where is it going?

00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:57.431
Where is this movement of our mind?

00:16:57.551 --> 00:17:00.202
What is it doing?

00:17:00.322 --> 00:17:03.064
You have to stand against your mind,

00:17:03.184 --> 00:17:05.904
stand against your desires,

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:08.084
or you can face it

00:17:08.204 --> 00:17:13.674
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

00:17:14.612 --> 00:17:18.106
It's for you to decide.

00:17:18.244 --> 00:17:22.640
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.429
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:27.772
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

00:17:27.892 --> 00:17:30.747
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:32.704
Whatever confessions you have made,

00:17:32.824 --> 00:17:35.224
I burnt all those letters.

00:17:35.344 --> 00:17:39.201
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:41.503
Nor do I want to know about it.

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:45.064
That's not My concern.

00:17:45.184 --> 00:17:49.351
My concern is that now

00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:57.111
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

00:17:58.104 --> 00:18:01.980
on the same level,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.581
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:12.784
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

00:18:12.904 --> 00:18:15.978
the thoughts that come to you

00:18:16.098 --> 00:18:18.466
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:23.107
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.739
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:34.473
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

00:18:34.593 --> 00:18:36.832
which you can ask.

00:18:36.952 --> 00:18:38.725
But you cannot always say that,

00:18:38.845 --> 00:18:41.425
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:44.364
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:49.015
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

00:18:53.962 --> 00:19:02.339
You see a person as a Sakshi.

00:19:02.459 --> 00:19:06.065
That means you see that person

00:19:06.185 --> 00:19:10.597
but you do not get a reaction,

00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:17.348
which is killer of joy.

00:19:19.657 --> 00:19:25.314
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

00:19:25.434 --> 00:19:33.352
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

00:19:33.525 --> 00:19:36.660
And be alert about it.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.635
If you want to be kind to yourself,

00:19:40.817 --> 00:19:46.711
know that you have to divert your attention

00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:49.918
towards a sane married life.

00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:54.040
But also that should not be too much.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.018
Because what I have learnt now,

00:19:57.138 --> 00:20:00.830
that in the West people have devised methods

00:20:00.998 --> 00:20:03.359
of transferring their attention

00:20:03.479 --> 00:20:07.270
from one person to another.

00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:11.243
Mental acrobatics of different type

00:20:11.363 --> 00:20:17.091
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:21.464
Don’t play onto these.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.231
There are so many other things by which

00:20:30.351 --> 00:20:34.453
we express that we are still under the trap

00:20:34.573 --> 00:20:36.407
of a bad Mooladhara.

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:38.842
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

00:20:38.962 --> 00:20:42.435
the way you sit, the way you talk,

00:20:42.555 --> 00:20:53.776
the way you behave, to impress other people.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:00.575
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:03.727
The only impression that should really work

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:10.266
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

00:21:12.292 --> 00:21:14.845
You can do it; it's not difficult.

00:21:14.965 --> 00:21:18.586
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

00:21:18.706 --> 00:21:23.415
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.797
But your question is first of all

00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:30.594
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:36.419
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.957
That's why I say sometimes

00:21:40.077 --> 00:21:44.289
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:49.117
especially the red meats and beefs,

00:21:49.237 --> 00:21:54.004
and horses, and dogs

00:21:56.058 --> 00:22:00.212
and I don't know what else you eat.

00:22:04.202 --> 00:22:07.184
Take more to vegetarian food.

00:22:07.304 --> 00:22:10.824
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

00:22:10.944 --> 00:22:12.520
Take more to things

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.365
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

00:22:17.945 --> 00:22:22.018
Even fish is very [inaudible].

00:22:22.877 --> 00:22:27.027
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

00:22:27.147 --> 00:22:32.688
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

00:22:32.824 --> 00:22:35.188
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

00:22:35.308 --> 00:22:38.537
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:43.305
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:47.910
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

00:22:48.172 --> 00:22:51.904
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

00:22:56.108 --> 00:22:58.644
So for you people,

00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:01.027
(You have to go?)

00:23:01.577 --> 00:23:10.436
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

00:23:10.594 --> 00:23:16.021
that food does make a difference

00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:19.931
in the powers of Mooladhara.

00:23:20.555 --> 00:23:24.653
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

00:23:24.773 --> 00:23:28.309
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

00:23:28.429 --> 00:23:31.053
over-excited.

00:23:31.173 --> 00:23:33.732
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

00:23:33.852 --> 00:23:35.425
any woman you look at ...

00:23:35.545 --> 00:23:39.049
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.506
Horrible.

00:23:41.626 --> 00:23:44.887
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:50.505
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:53.268
There's no grace.

00:23:53.388 --> 00:23:56.679
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:59.824
“you must respect yourself.”

00:23:59.944 --> 00:24:03.553
It cannot work out with those words I know.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.197
You have to sit down,

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:18.327
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

00:24:21.214 --> 00:24:22.939
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:24.458
what things can be done about it,

00:24:24.578 --> 00:24:28.422
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

00:24:28.542 --> 00:24:32.591
But still this is all physical.

00:24:32.711 --> 00:24:37.689
Mentally you must be on the watch

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:42.220
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

00:24:42.362 --> 00:24:47.258
Why does it always go to this sensation?

00:24:47.764 --> 00:24:54.621
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

00:24:54.741 --> 00:25:00.447
see the beautiful people, just see them.

00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:04.571
Another horrible thing in the West

00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:07.160
is that the women must expose their body

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.561
to get men excited.

00:25:09.681 --> 00:25:11.619
Men do the same I think.

00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:13.388
They always try to excite each other

00:25:13.508 --> 00:25:17.330
and live in a stupid excitement.

00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:25.580
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.547
beautiful ornaments.

00:25:28.667 --> 00:25:33.561
All right? But you're not a thing!

00:25:36.082 --> 00:25:45.393
It's your private property.

00:25:45.926 --> 00:25:50.237
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

00:25:50.357 --> 00:25:53.485
Better try that, sometimes.

00:25:53.605 --> 00:25:57.034
You will mind people plundering your gold,

00:25:57.154 --> 00:26:00.734
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

00:26:00.854 --> 00:26:04.640
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.662
You don't feel insulted?

00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:10.562
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

00:26:10.682 --> 00:26:15.035
It feels happy that people are watching you.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.423
They are plundering you.

00:26:19.543 --> 00:26:23.022
They are looting your chastity.

00:26:27.797 --> 00:26:31.217
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

00:26:31.337 --> 00:26:35.859
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

00:26:35.979 --> 00:26:42.201
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

00:26:47.256 --> 00:26:51.692
The minds are very funnily placed,

00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:55.459
and that's why the greatest complications there are

00:26:55.579 --> 00:26:58.746
in the brains of people.

00:26:58.866 --> 00:27:02.052
They are very confused,

00:27:02.172 --> 00:27:05.762
very confused people.

00:27:06.095 --> 00:27:09.208
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:14.381
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

00:27:15.377 --> 00:27:18.353
It is actually just the other way round.

00:27:18.473 --> 00:27:22.213
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:25.476
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

00:27:25.596 --> 00:27:28.689
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:31.248
And why not this property of yours

00:27:31.368 --> 00:27:32.988
which is the highest of all,

00:27:33.108 --> 00:27:36.912
to be preserved, to be adorned,

00:27:37.032 --> 00:27:39.854
to be worshipped?

00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:47.207
I'm quite worried on that point

00:27:47.327 --> 00:27:53.650
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.819
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

00:27:55.939 --> 00:27:58.122
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

00:27:58.242 --> 00:28:00.785
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

00:28:00.905 --> 00:28:03.524
but in this matter they think they can go about

00:28:03.644 --> 00:28:06.386
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

00:28:06.506 --> 00:28:10.454
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

00:28:10.574 --> 00:28:14.742
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:18.848
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:21.556
towards your life, towards your being,

00:28:21.676 --> 00:28:25.611
towards your personality. You are saints.

00:28:26.447 --> 00:28:29.348
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

00:28:29.468 --> 00:28:32.371
I call it the character, the essence of character,

00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:35.099
is not a saint.

00:28:39.493 --> 00:28:42.230
So this purity has to be maintained.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.743
There cannot be any compromise on that.

00:28:45.863 --> 00:28:49.835
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

00:28:50.556 --> 00:28:54.040
If it works out,

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.786
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

00:28:58.906 --> 00:29:02.067
nobody deceives oneself

00:29:02.712 --> 00:29:06.637
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

00:29:06.757 --> 00:29:09.973
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

00:29:10.093 --> 00:29:12.613
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

00:29:12.733 --> 00:29:15.256
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:19.639
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:23.756
your mind can be cleansed.

00:29:24.441 --> 00:29:27.959
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:32.038
“not this, not this, not this.”

00:29:32.924 --> 00:29:37.015
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

00:29:38.246 --> 00:29:40.795
I know it's difficult,

00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:45.162
but if you can get realization why not this also?

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.197
You all have to understand

00:29:49.317 --> 00:29:51.744
that there is no compromise on this.

00:29:51.864 --> 00:29:54.752
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

00:29:54.872 --> 00:29:57.222
you will be thrown away completely,

00:29:57.342 --> 00:30:01.722
just like any other devil is thrown out.

00:30:03.898 --> 00:30:06.684
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:10.324
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.082
You cannot ascend

00:30:12.202 --> 00:30:16.173
if there is any lurking thing within you.

00:30:16.293 --> 00:30:19.291
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

00:30:19.411 --> 00:30:24.016
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

00:30:24.449 --> 00:30:28.130
Only question is “where is your attention?”

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:33.553
Divert. Divert your attention.

00:30:36.036 --> 00:30:40.674
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

00:30:40.794 --> 00:30:47.056
and afterwards it will come automatically.

00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:50.827
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

00:30:50.947 --> 00:30:53.837
On the contrary,

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:58.942
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

00:31:00.837 --> 00:31:03.279
So much conditioning is there.

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:06.892
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

00:31:07.158 --> 00:31:10.018
we have ruined ourselves.

00:31:10.138 --> 00:31:12.747
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

00:31:12.867 --> 00:31:15.804
and the worst of all.

00:31:15.924 --> 00:31:19.408
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:19.528 --> 00:31:21.419
unless and until you individually

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.626
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

00:31:31.205 --> 00:31:34.526
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

00:31:34.646 --> 00:31:39.247
and the most powerful chakra.

00:31:39.988 --> 00:31:47.805
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

00:31:49.964 --> 00:31:55.108
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

00:31:55.228 --> 00:31:58.082
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

00:31:58.202 --> 00:32:01.142
your wisdom will fail.

00:32:05.179 --> 00:32:08.114
You will have no sense of direction.

00:32:08.234 --> 00:32:11.988
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

00:32:12.108 --> 00:32:14.081
before they become forty years of age

00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:16.742
is because their Mooladharas are out.

00:32:16.862 --> 00:32:20.285
Most of the diseases which are incurable

00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:24.571
come because of weak Mooladharas,

00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:28.006
on the physical side.

00:32:28.126 --> 00:32:30.129
On the mental side,

00:32:30.249 --> 00:32:33.423
most of the mental problems we saw there,

00:32:33.543 --> 00:32:39.207
most, I would say ninety percent,

00:32:39.327 --> 00:32:41.751
are due to weak Mooladhara.

00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:44.872
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

00:32:44.992 --> 00:32:48.054
powerful Mooladhara,

00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:50.974
it doesn't get into trouble.

00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:54.012
Because you know there's a very strong hold

00:32:54.132 --> 00:32:57.697
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

00:32:57.817 --> 00:33:03.133
And when your mind goes off,

00:33:06.242 --> 00:33:09.288
you blame the brain.

00:33:09.496 --> 00:33:14.723
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

00:33:14.843 --> 00:33:18.866
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

00:33:18.986 --> 00:33:26.977
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.514
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

00:33:32.634 --> 00:33:35.720
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:42.114
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.897
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

00:33:49.624 --> 00:33:53.628
because the sensationalization

00:33:53.748 --> 00:33:57.071
has become the main theme of modern life.

00:33:57.191 --> 00:34:03.690
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:07.975
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

00:34:08.095 --> 00:34:16.154
Media, books, ideas, everything,

00:34:16.527 --> 00:34:22.507
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

00:34:25.577 --> 00:34:27.779
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:32.861
doesn't have any balance.

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:35.529
Actually he's hypocritical,

00:34:35.649 --> 00:34:40.141
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:43.473
So many complications take place with this.

00:34:43.606 --> 00:34:47.623
Before realization, forget the past.

00:34:48.395 --> 00:34:50.794
Whatever you have done, forget it.

00:34:50.914 --> 00:34:53.288
Just don't worry.

00:34:53.408 --> 00:34:55.325
But remember one thing,

00:34:55.445 --> 00:34:58.214
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

00:34:58.334 --> 00:35:01.460
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.030
you have to bring it to normalcy.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:09.685
You have to make it a healthy,

00:35:11.208 --> 00:35:16.008
balanced center,

00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:22.317
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

00:35:25.648 --> 00:35:29.626
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

00:35:29.746 --> 00:35:34.314
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

00:35:35.343 --> 00:35:37.780
We talk of innocence,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.617
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

00:35:40.737 --> 00:35:45.407
we must be on the full watch,

00:35:45.527 --> 00:35:50.685
on the full alertness about our minds.

00:35:50.805 --> 00:35:53.442
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

00:35:53.562 --> 00:35:55.785
Where is this thief going?

00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:58.467
Is he trying to do some tricks?

00:35:58.587 --> 00:36:02.105
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

00:36:02.225 --> 00:36:06.055
You have to be alert, very alert.

00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:10.574
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

00:36:10.694 --> 00:36:13.660
But now I have to tell you one thing.

00:36:13.785 --> 00:36:15.377
That you'll be exposed.

00:36:15.497 --> 00:36:18.167
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

00:36:18.287 --> 00:36:20.217
She'll expose you.

00:36:20.337 --> 00:36:23.194
You'll be exposed

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:26.873
if you try to play tricks with Me.

00:36:27.032 --> 00:36:29.513
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

00:36:29.633 --> 00:36:32.327
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

00:36:32.447 --> 00:36:35.057
you'll be exposed.

00:36:35.177 --> 00:36:38.418
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

00:36:39.305 --> 00:36:43.472
So please be careful, very careful about it,

00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:49.836
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

00:36:49.956 --> 00:36:52.973
and powerful.

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:56.398
May God bless you!

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:06.545
So our prayer should be that

00:37:06.665 --> 00:37:11.635
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

00:37:11.755 --> 00:37:15.220
That's all. Let’s pray.

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:30.093
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

00:37:30.213 --> 00:37:36.306
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

00:37:36.426 --> 00:37:38.184
Then he will pass it on to you.

00:37:38.304 --> 00:37:43.945
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

00:37:44.065 --> 00:37:47.128
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

00:37:47.248 --> 00:37:51.828
should come and see him every month sometime,

00:37:51.948 --> 00:37:56.200
and these things should be talked.

00:37:58.071 --> 00:38:01.929
Because it's a secret,

00:38:02.049 --> 00:38:03.412
not to be discussed openly.

00:38:03.532 --> 00:38:07.397
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

00:38:08.798 --> 00:38:11.981
It should not be written down anywhere.

00:38:12.101 --> 00:38:14.250
It should not be mentioned,

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.814
but should be worked out by all of you,

00:38:17.934 --> 00:38:23.544
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

00:38:25.249 --> 00:38:29.249
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

00:38:29.369 --> 00:38:33.587
Because men suffer much more than women do.

00:38:35.857 --> 00:38:39.698
And that's why women must be very careful.

00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:44.875
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

00:38:48.052 --> 00:38:56.795
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

00:38:56.915 --> 00:39:00.607
men cannot be improved.

00:39:01.368 --> 00:39:03.943
You have seen in India women don’t like it

00:39:04.063 --> 00:39:06.345
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

00:39:06.465 --> 00:39:08.162
They don't like it.

00:39:08.282 --> 00:39:11.591
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:16.115
thousands of them, because they thought some

00:39:16.295 --> 00:39:20.477
other people may come and touch their body.

00:39:21.733 --> 00:39:29.378
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

00:39:30.049 --> 00:39:32.981
As if it is the body,

00:39:33.141 --> 00:39:36.342
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

00:39:41.536 --> 00:39:45.985
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

00:39:46.105 --> 00:39:49.910
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.833
the power of their chastity.

00:39:54.763 --> 00:39:57.165
It's more for ladies here,

00:39:57.285 --> 00:40:02.432
that they should try to generate that feeling

00:40:02.552 --> 00:40:06.168
of nobility, of chastity,

00:40:06.288 --> 00:40:08.969
of holiness around them,

00:40:09.089 --> 00:40:14.373
so that the men themselves respect them

00:40:14.611 --> 00:40:19.145
and develop that feeling within themselves.

00:40:21.517 --> 00:40:24.077
Thank you very much.
