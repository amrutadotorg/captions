00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:18.120
Today is the second day of our new journey into
the battlefield. We have to win people with

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:28.604
love, compassion, affection and dignity.
When we say it’s a Vishwa Dharma, it’s

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:43.391
a Universal Religion we belong to, first and
foremost thing, the essence of that, is peace.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:53.375
The peace has to be within, to begin with.
You have to be peaceful within yourself. If

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:05.360
you are not peaceful, if you are playing tricks
with your ego, if you are just satisfying

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.390
yourself saying that you are peaceful, you
are sadly mistaken.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:22.840
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself. It
is to be felt within yourself. So do not give

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:34.189
wrong satisfactions to yourself, do not give
false notions to yourself. Don’t cheat yourself.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.520
Peace has to be felt within yourself, and
if you are not feeling that, you shouldn’t

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.200
come and ask me, “Mother, why I am not feeling
it.” Because I am not going to tell you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:55.030
that something [is] wrong with you. You have
to work it out that you should feel peaceful

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.430
within yourself.
It is not that if you have too much of silence

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:12.644
outside, you feel peaceful. The peace has
to be within yourself. You have it. Your Spirit

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.814
is absolutely peaceful – Avyagra, without
restlessness. There is no restlessness in

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:30.545
your Spirit. Absolutely peaceful and steady.
It is for you to feel it. It is not for anybody

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.559
else to certify you. This is one thing. Secondly,
when I am telling you something, you think

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:40.260
I am not telling you. It doesn’t register
in your brain. You think I am telling it to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.260
X, Y, Z but not to you. You are not in it.
That’s another sign [that] there is no peace.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.290
Because there is no peace, there is no registration.
Whatever goes into your head, that is going

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.690
to work out.
But what I find [is] that people [who] have

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:11.520
concave personalities, then they receive it.
Those who have convex personalities, do not

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:18.589
register anything . The registration is so
poor that, whatever I say doesn’t have any

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.380
effect on them. Otherwise, whatever I say
is a mantra. It should have direct effect

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.572
on you, and you should feel that effect, that
penetration within you. But as if it is for

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:48.663
somebody else, as if it is not for you. This
shows there is no peace within you.

00:03:50.499 --> 00:04:02.025
Only the peace within can register whatever
is auspicious, whatever is nourishing for

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:12.745
your growth. So try to make peace with yourself.
Do not fight with yourself, “Why should

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.170
I do it?”, “I am so bad!”, “I should
not have done it!” – all these we should

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.999
not do. Try not to fight with yourself, first
of all.

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:27.249
Then you fight with me, “Why am I like this?
Why should it be like this with me? Why is

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:32.480
it I catch? Why. . . .?.” How am I to answer
such a question? It is very aggressive. I

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.740
think it is very aggressive attitude of many
Sahaja Yogis to come and ask me such a question,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:45.130
“Why…?” Because I can’t tell you what
is wrong with you because it is not in my

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.309
culture. You should find yourself what is
wrong with you . But it’s not “what’s

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:57.309
wrong with you” is the problem. What is
right with you is the attitude. Whatever is

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.190
right with you, put your foot on that, establish
yourself on that point. And then develop yourself

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:16.090
higher.
Peace is the keynote, as I said, for universal

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:23.430
growth of this Religion.
It is disturbed by many things. Firstly, as

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.580
I said, by yourself. You shouldn’t have
funny ideas about yourself. People have very

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.080
funny ideas. I see Sahaja Yogis, as soon as
they get realisation, or something better

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.919
happens to them, they start telling others
how to do meditation, how to stand up, how

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.919
to give bandhan, how to do this and that.
It’s very very poor, is very low level.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:06:02.044
Try to assimilate within yourself. First grow
yourself That growth itself, will tell others

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:09.500
how one should be. Your own character, your
own temperament, your own nature, your own

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.160
behaviour. All this will tell others that
this is a great man and they will try to follow

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.520
your example. Example is the best teaching.
When the tree is small, even if he says “I

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.520
am great,” nobody is going to sit under
a dwarf tree! But when it is a big tree you

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.180
can see the shade and everybody knows it’s
a big tree and they can come and sit under

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:42.937
that. You don’t have to tell. In the same
way, when you grow, you don’t have to certify

00:06:43.077 --> 00:06:56.498
that “I am great”, it just works.
Now the peace within expresses, first of all,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:06.169
[as] peace with others. That is the first
sign of manifestation of peace. Such a person

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:16.610
doesn’t use harsh words, doesn’t use cruel
words. But he’s also not a person who is

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:25.874
ineffective. He’s very effective, using
very sweet and nice words. Maybe he begins

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.080
by using harsh words, then he mellows down
and comes down to a position where he is effective

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:43.764
as well as he is very mild and sweet.
Such a personality has to be developed – outside.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:51.931
So, peace with your friends, peace with Sahaja
Yogis. If you cannot be peaceful with Sahaja

00:07:52.140 --> 00:08:01.681
Yogis then you are no good. Absolutely no
good. When you meet another Sahaja Yogi you

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:11.374
can’t bark like dogs at each other, can
you? You leave three Sahaja Yogis together,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.919
you end up with a big barking system. They
can’t manage within themselves. If there

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:24.555
are hundred, then it’s alright. But you
can’t leave three and four here and there.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:35.448
So the peace should be with your brothers
and sisters. They are all born out of My Sahasrara

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:46.584
and nobody has the right to insult, to be
sarcastic. Saying things which are harmful.

00:08:48.818 --> 00:08:54.260
That’s no friendship, that’s no friendship.
It is a kind of a very subtle enmity that

00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:04.382
you are carrying on in your hearts. That cannot
be forgiveness. If you say sarcastic things

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:17.862
to others, you are not in the culture of Universal
Religion. You should be respectful. The more

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:26.062
respectable you are to each other, the better
it would be.

00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:32.852
I don’t know how to tell you this. But say,
there is a Sahaja Yogi, you shouldn’t call

00:09:32.852 --> 00:09:42.259
him like as you would call any Tom Dick and
Harry. Like there’s someone going. “Eh

00:09:42.592 --> 00:09:54.460
Mr. X, come here!” Now people don’t even
say Mister. Please try to use their surnames

00:09:54.572 --> 00:10:03.380
would be better. Mr. So, Mr. So Mr. So. .Would
be better.

00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:08.223
Because this modern style of not using the
surname has brought down the respect for each

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:14.833
other. But I think, Sahaja Yogis should try
a new method and suggest to Me even better

00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:24.240
methods, how to address each other, in such
a way that you respect others. That respect

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:32.560
will create that peace within each other.
Suddenly you come out with remarks. Very nasty

00:10:32.713 --> 00:10:38.163
remarks they are. There’s no sense in it.
That’s not our culture. We belong to Universal

00:10:38.163 --> 00:10:52.156
Religion, how can it be that culture?
So, when you try to be peaceful with your

00:10:52.252 --> 00:11:00.894
brothers and sisters, try to be extremely
respectful. When you write letters to each

00:11:01.013 --> 00:11:06.153
other, you say “My dear brother in Sahaja
Yoga Such and Such.” I have seen all communists

00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:14.705
do that. Any body who belongs to any party
does that. It’s a kind of a respect they

00:11:14.692 --> 00:11:31.606
have. You can’t talk like street people
and ordinary people because you are really

00:11:31.993 --> 00:11:42.237
extraordinary, and all that is extraordinary
has to be expressed through you.

00:11:42.423 --> 00:11:55.949
As I am talking to you of this new culture,
let us understand how in many nations, people

00:11:56.002 --> 00:12:06.382
have adopted cultures and cultures. Japan,
I know, has been affected, very much, by modernisation.

00:12:06.523 --> 00:12:13.523
But Zen taught them certain kind of culture
in which, supposing, you see two Japanese

00:12:13.803 --> 00:12:19.703
have a car and they break each other’s car,
then they don’t say anything. They come

00:12:19.703 --> 00:12:23.853
out of their car, one will bow to another,
the another will bow to another, and get into

00:12:23.853 --> 00:12:28.632
the car and get out.
Then if they have to claim something, they’ll

00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:34.593
go to the courts, but there they don’t fight,
because what is the need? And I asked Japanese,

00:12:34.593 --> 00:12:38.773
“How do you manage it?” So they said,
“But what is the need to fight there on

00:12:38.773 --> 00:12:42.863
the street? Because after all, if it is to
be paid, it’s the insurance that is going

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:49.312
to pay. If the car is broken, alright they
are going to pay us. Why to shout at him?”

00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:55.692
It’s very sensible and practical, I think.
Why to waste your breath for nothing at all?

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.553
You are not going to get anything.
But I have known people who drive, and they

00:12:59.553 --> 00:13:05.242
are abusing every person who comes across
on their driving. I mean, really it’s curse

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:12.465
of life, the way some people drive! And the
same way they drive in their own lives. All

00:13:12.903 --> 00:13:17.572
the time cursing this, “That one is like
this, this one is bad, that one is doing like

00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:22.833
that”. Even in Sahaja Yoga. They think they
have a right to criticize each and every person

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:27.603
except for themselves.
So to keep this peace with others, be on an

00:13:27.603 --> 00:13:34.033
apologetic mood. “I hope I haven’t done
this mistake.” “I hope I haven’t hurt

00:13:34.033 --> 00:13:44.012
you.” “I hope I haven’t put your things
in a wrong way.” Like that. Be on an apologetic

00:13:44.132 --> 00:13:47.742
mood.
You can find that among Indians. Indians have

00:13:47.742 --> 00:13:53.143
that kind of a problem, they are more on apologetic
mood. Sometimes, it is impossible to convince

00:13:53.143 --> 00:14:02.717
them. I will give you an example. We went
down to Sangli, and you were so full in the

00:14:03.013 --> 00:14:09.062
morning and the food was not ready. So they
said that “We cannot have our food because

00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:15.902
it is late now and it will be later, so better
we sleep off.” They felt very hurt, you

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:22.822
know. They thought that it was their mistake.
Now, it is registered that we haven’t given

00:14:22.822 --> 00:14:28.452
food to them, it is a horrid thing we have
done. And then I had to convince them that

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:32.162
they are no way hurt, they are happy that
they are not eating, they have too much of

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:37.082
food. “No, but still it will be registered
in our name that we didn’t offer them food

00:14:37.082 --> 00:14:43.143
and they slept without any food.” It was
impossible to convince them till the end,

00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:48.623
they were all the time feeling apologetic.
You see in Indian culture, we have something

00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:54.332
very great, as Japanese, as I told you, that
we are more on the apologetic style. Never

00:14:54.332 --> 00:15:00.672
on the aggressive. Never trying to find faults
with others, but we find faults in what way

00:15:00.672 --> 00:15:10.596
we have failed, how we have failed. This is
something to be learned from Indians, if they

00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:20.846
have retained their culture at all. It’s
actually in their blood.

00:15:24.902 --> 00:15:32.419
So that is how, our culture is going to be
such that we will express complete peace within

00:15:32.772 --> 00:15:39.133
ourselves. And you must know that you are
in one body, active. You are active cells

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:44.133
in one body. All the cells of the body are
never active. But those who are active have

00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:51.646
to be at peace with each other, otherwise,
what will happen to that poor body? So try

00:15:52.113 --> 00:15:57.113
to make peace.
The second thing you can do to make peace

00:15:57.113 --> 00:16:04.113
is to talk less. Whenever there is a quarrel
or anything, just keep quiet. You see, it

00:16:04.802 --> 00:16:09.633
will have better effect. If two persons are
quarrelling, never try to solve it, but just

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:17.121
keep quiet. Quiet is very important. More
to be silent. But it should not be another

00:16:17.942 --> 00:16:24.942
extreme like English culture, that they just
don’t talk, whatever it is. They don’t

00:16:25.022 --> 00:16:35.956
talk, but, they think too much. You must keep
quiet with the feeling that ‘May God bless

00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:54.653
these people some sense.”
It should not be ice frozen sea, but peace
which is effective. Peace that is effective.

00:16:54.772 --> 00:17:01.772
So in this new culture, we have to be extremely
peaceful people. And that peace should be

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:14.204
expressed on your faces. People should understand
that you are peaceful. That’s why I say,

00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:18.263
if you are neatly dressed, your hair are neatly
put, people will feel alright. Otherwise if

00:17:18.263 --> 00:17:24.402
you reach some person with dishevelled hair,
you know he gets disturbed as it is! “God

00:17:24.402 --> 00:17:30.003
knows what has happened? From which quarrel
this man is coming? Somebody must have pulled

00:17:30.003 --> 00:17:38.267
his hair, or must have something gone wrong
with him, that the way he is dishevelled.”

00:17:39.863 --> 00:17:44.332
So if you are neatly dressed, people are not
put off so much, because they think that “No,

00:17:44.332 --> 00:17:48.702
no, this cannot be, because, you see, after
all, he never had a quarrel. He’s just coming

00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:55.702
peacefully from his house.”
In our culture, neatness in very important.

00:17:55.863 --> 00:18:07.290
Neatness of thought, neatness of mind, neatness
of body, neatness of behaviour. How you do

00:18:07.743 --> 00:18:14.743
things neatly is very important in our culture.
That’s very, very important! Which may look

00:18:14.892 --> 00:18:20.883
very funny to some people. Because, whether
you hold the fork this way or that way makes

00:18:20.883 --> 00:18:29.192
no difference to Me. It doesn’t matter how
you hold your fork or knife on a table. That’s

00:18:29.503 --> 00:18:33.272
not so important.
But it’s definitely it’s important how

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:46.183
you hold the Aarti, how you hold the Puja
things, how you hold my photographs. How you

00:18:46.302 --> 00:18:51.552
hold the things that belong to other Sahaja
Yogis, how you respect the things that are

00:18:51.552 --> 00:19:02.364
auspicious.
So that is what one has to have within yourself.

00:19:02.613 --> 00:19:11.445
The neatness, of piousness, of auspiciousness,
of holiness. That is to be done with very

00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:18.222
great care and understanding, and with that
weight of auspiciousness you should walk.

00:19:18.222 --> 00:19:28.368
With that weight of auspiciousness. You are
auspiciousness walking on this earth, yourself.

00:19:28.922 --> 00:19:43.079
You are peace on this earth. But the way peace
is put into this vessel has to be clean, has

00:19:43.092 --> 00:19:51.425
to be neat and has to be placed in such a
way that nothing spills out.

00:19:54.852 --> 00:20:01.852
So to have peace, the best way to put your
mind right, is to think of good things. Think

00:20:03.003 --> 00:20:10.003
of the flowers, not of the thorns. What good
things others have done to you. What good

00:20:10.182 --> 00:20:18.987
things there are. What are the beautiful moments
you have had, and count your blessings. Count

00:20:19.072 --> 00:20:24.642
your blessings. Otherwise you cannot create
peace.

00:20:24.642 --> 00:20:39.851
[Mother tells someone off in Marathi]
You need not pay attention to everything like

00:20:39.873 --> 00:20:51.476
that. Keep your attention at peace. Keep the
peace inside, with your attention inside.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:08.937
Actually, if you really allow all my words
to go inside your brain, I’m sure I’ll

00:21:08.993 --> 00:21:15.993
achieve the results but with a convex mind,
it’s very difficult. Just suck in!

00:21:23.182 --> 00:21:37.349
The another aspect of peace is never try to
support anything that is boisterous or which

00:21:37.442 --> 00:21:46.980
is destructive. Anything that is destructive
is never to be supported. But anybody who

00:21:47.062 --> 00:22:03.674
is being tortured or aggressed or dominated,
is to be protected and supported. If you have

00:22:03.712 --> 00:22:12.384
the strength of peace, you can do it just
by standing there. You don’t have to fight

00:22:12.532 --> 00:22:23.085
for your peace. But if it comes to that…
A person like Hitler when he came, people

00:22:23.192 --> 00:22:37.685
had to fight for their peace.
Now, the second part of our culture has to

00:22:37.902 --> 00:22:46.786
be Bliss. People should see bliss working
in us. People should feel there is bliss.

00:22:46.892 --> 00:23:00.948
If a person is blissful, he looks blissful.
He emits, bliss. He radiates it. He doesn’t

00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:13.691
look a miserable, unhappy creature, who is
all the time grudging, grumbling or worried

00:23:13.753 --> 00:23:24.566
about little petty things here and there.
And nobody has the right to disturb anybody’s

00:23:24.753 --> 00:23:32.906
bliss. [If] somebody is in a blissful state,
try to copy that person and become that. But

00:23:32.972 --> 00:23:38.623
people get jealous of such people who are
blissful and try to disturb! That’s why

00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:44.222
so many saints were tortured, because they
were so blissful and happy people.

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:54.050
We have to enjoy our bliss within, that is
important. Perhaps you are not aware of the

00:23:54.253 --> 00:24:09.071
bliss that you have. Not at all aware. Never,
never before there were so many people who

00:24:09.082 --> 00:24:14.902
got realisation. Never before, in the history,
that Adi Shakti Herself came on this earth

00:24:14.902 --> 00:24:30.574
to solve your problems. Never before, that
people of very ordinary effort, of very little

00:24:30.672 --> 00:24:43.163
seeking, of very little understanding have
been given realisation like this. It’s like,

00:24:43.253 --> 00:24:52.163
sometimes, if you see, like a stone becoming
a diamond suddenly. You can cut a diamond

00:24:52.373 --> 00:24:59.986
from a diamond.
Such blissful state you are in. It’s tremendous

00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:11.440
bliss has come. It’s so effective. I myself
don’t know when I see them. I’m really

00:25:11.562 --> 00:25:19.861
surprised how it is working.
Bliss can only come through gratitude. Only

00:25:20.154 --> 00:25:30.746
through enlarging your heart with gratitude.
Bliss is the reward of gratitude. The gratitude

00:25:30.932 --> 00:25:47.908
which is not just worldly or just spoken lip-service,
but is from the heart, is from the heart,

00:25:48.062 --> 00:25:58.899
gratitude of the heart. And the blissful people
are never jealous of others because what is

00:25:59.072 --> 00:26:08.179
greater than bliss? Bliss has so many dimensions
that you go beyond the realm of cause and

00:26:08.472 --> 00:26:16.292
effects. All the angels, all the ganas are
there to help you. You know that it works

00:26:16.552 --> 00:26:21.802
out. This way it works out, that…. But you
take it for granted. You don’t have that

00:26:21.802 --> 00:26:30.050
effect of the bliss in you when you know this
has happened, that, has happened. What a bliss!

00:26:30.412 --> 00:26:35.962
You cross your hearts when you feel blissful.
Cross your hearts and feel that, just see.

00:26:35.962 --> 00:26:42.912
Feel the bliss like this – cross your hearts.
Feel the bliss! Tremendous bliss is within

00:26:42.912 --> 00:26:56.871
us. How much it has happened to us that God
has been so kind. Will you please put your

00:26:57.422 --> 00:27:04.042
hands across those who are sitting down there,
please! The other lady also. Where is she

00:27:04.042 --> 00:27:19.600
looking? You are sitting on a chair, must
you look at every person who is coming? There

00:27:19.863 --> 00:27:37.741
is no need!. Feel it! May God bless you.
So this bliss when you find everywhere, in

00:27:38.022 --> 00:27:48.695
a little thing also you find there is bliss.
Zen taught that to people. They saw bliss

00:27:48.692 --> 00:27:55.692
in seeing only a moss, a little bit of moss,
and you see the moss and you say, “0 God,

00:27:56.022 --> 00:28:02.452
what a beautiful piece it is! ” God has
created little moss, and that moss has all

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:11.168
that little little tentacles, and that bliss.
But those who are vain people can never feel

00:28:11.262 --> 00:28:25.269
bliss. Vanity kills bliss. Ego kills bliss.
Once Shivaji was building a huge fort. And,

00:28:25.532 --> 00:28:34.109
there it so happened that he got into ego.
He felt, “See because of this work, so many

00:28:34.123 --> 00:28:44.220
people are employed.” [Then] his Guru Ramdasa
appeared on the scene. He himself is the controller

00:28:44.342 --> 00:28:50.832
of ego, because he was the incarnation of
Hanumana. So he came and he said “Alright,

00:28:50.832 --> 00:28:57.142
I want you to do one thing for me”. He said,
“Yes Sir, what do you want me to do?”

00:28:57.142 --> 00:29:02.792
He said, “You break this boulder that is
lying here, such a big boulder, bit by bit.”

00:29:02.792 --> 00:29:11.910
So it started breaking when people hit it.
And inside came a little stone which he took

00:29:12.202 --> 00:29:20.975
up just like a coconut in his hand and he
broke [it]. And there was water and there

00:29:21.062 --> 00:29:32.467
was a frog inside. And he realised, Shivaji,
that, “if God has created this frog, He’s

00:29:32.873 --> 00:29:39.422
also given him water. Who am I to have this
ego?”

00:29:39.422 --> 00:29:51.620
So the bliss came into him, that God has provided
me with everything. It’s just a red-carpet

00:29:51.802 --> 00:29:57.892
treatment for me. What have I done? Nothing.
It is so beautiful!

00:29:57.892 --> 00:30:07.740
How many have got this bliss? Have sympathy
for them. Have compassion for them, those

00:30:08.082 --> 00:30:17.880
who do not have.
But bliss comes to you through your confidence,

00:30:18.132 --> 00:30:25.132
If you have no confidence in yourself, bliss
cannot be. And the worst thing against confidence

00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:31.983
is – “Then what should I do? Then how
can I get it? Then why not I have?” – is

00:30:31.983 --> 00:30:43.724
the worst. You fighting yourself all the time!
You are that, sitting on that, and still if

00:30:44.022 --> 00:30:50.033
you are saying, “Why shouldn’t have it,”
so what to answer? I mean you just want to

00:30:50.033 --> 00:31:02.109
ask because you have to ask? It’s there.
Why are you asking? Just feel it!

00:31:03.286 --> 00:31:15.066
If that works out, that you feel where you
are sitting, then you’ll be surprised that

00:31:15.983 --> 00:31:20.122
you are at peace with yourself, and there
is bliss.

00:31:28.062 --> 00:31:35.062
Last of all, in this culture, you Have to
behave like people who have authority. You

00:31:35.062 --> 00:31:44.764
have the authority of your Spirit. You are
authorised. You have the Spirit. Those who

00:31:44.834 --> 00:31:50.604
are in authority never try to show off. Because
they are in authority, what is there to show

00:31:50.604 --> 00:32:02.588
off? Only mad people show off, you see.
If somebody puts a label on the head “I

00:32:03.005 --> 00:32:10.005
am Inspector General of Police”, people
will say that – take him to lunatic asylum.

00:32:16.235 --> 00:32:20.775
In the same way, some people say, “I am
Sahaja Yogi. What do you say? I can do what

00:32:20.775 --> 00:32:34.390
I like!” Then where should we put him? Your
authority is your Self, your own being. People

00:32:34.725 --> 00:32:41.725
should see in you what you are. You don’t
have to carry labels with you that, “I am

00:32:42.114 --> 00:32:52.633
Sahaja Yogi such and such!” – X Y Z number.
criminal No. 5, criminal No. 10! You are authorised.

00:32:52.675 --> 00:32:58.015
Authority shows on your face. But now you
are actualised on the authority.

00:32:58.015 --> 00:33:05.015
You see, all the authorities are artificial.
For example, somebody today is Prime Minister,

00:33:05.245 --> 00:33:11.094
may become a beggar on the street. Could be.
In democracy everything is possible. Same

00:33:11.094 --> 00:33:16.044
in any authoritarian governments. So today,
you might be something at the height, you

00:33:16.044 --> 00:33:22.275
might just go down. But a Sahaja Yogi will
remain a Sahaja Yogi. You are authorised and

00:33:22.275 --> 00:33:26.844
actualised. Means whatever is your authority
is part and parcel of your being, you are

00:33:26.844 --> 00:33:31.354
that. Like you are a human being, you are
a human being. Now you can’t grow tails

00:33:31.354 --> 00:33:41.824
even if you want.
So now you are authorised, actualised, completely

00:33:42.165 --> 00:33:53.737
moulded Sahaja Yogis. Like the sandalwood
– sandalwood is not to be told by taking

00:33:54.465 --> 00:34:01.465
a vow “oh, it is sandalwood”. It is sandalwood
because every part of it (microphone stops

00:34:21.066 --> 00:34:23.566
All right? You can hear me I think.

00:34:24.383 --> 00:34:27.661
You hear me from your Sahasrara.

00:34:28.274 --> 00:34:36.772
Every part of you, every bit of you must have the fragrance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:54.532 --> 00:36:59.675
So you are not only actualised, you are perfected.

00:36:59.834 --> 00:37:09.649
You are perfected.
So you must have the dignity of that authority

00:37:09.814 --> 00:37:28.552
in you. And dignity is very humble dignity.
Dignity is never arrogant. The sign of dignity

00:37:28.755 --> 00:37:46.277
is humility. I told you a story about a person
who had gone out and he went and asked a blind

00:37:46.334 --> 00:37:55.578
man, a saint, if he had seen anybody going
this way. So the saint said “Yes, you are

00:37:55.784 --> 00:38:02.784
the king, I know Sir. Your servant was here
first, and then your Minister came, and now

00:38:02.935 --> 00:38:13.819
you have come.” He was amazed, because he
was blind. How could a blind person see these

00:38:14.005 --> 00:38:19.364
things? He said, “I could make out from
the humility.”

00:38:19.364 --> 00:38:28.290
When your servant came, he said, “Eh you
blind man! Have you seen somebody going this

00:38:28.425 --> 00:38:36.729
way?” When your minister came he said, “Have
you seen someone going this way?” But when

00:38:36.965 --> 00:38:44.462
you came, you said “Sir, I am sorry to ask
you such a question, but did you hear somebody

00:38:44.534 --> 00:39:00.461
was passing this way?”
This is what it is. Humility is the sign.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:07.284
How you talk to others, immediately people
will know that you have the authority from

00:39:07.284 --> 00:39:25.985
God. See the humbleness of Divine. How it
is trying to please you, and amuse you, and

00:39:26.265 --> 00:39:41.546
make you happy, in the nature, also in the
lectures! (referring to the way the microphone
