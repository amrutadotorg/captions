00:00.409 --> 00:04.652
I’ll talk to you about the Right Side,

00:04.853 --> 00:08.474
Right Side sympathetic nervous system,

00:08.675 --> 00:22.418
which is expressed by our subtle energy
of Mahasaraswati,

00:22.712 --> 00:27.119
which gives us the power to act.

00:30.583 --> 00:35.131
By [the] Left Side we desire

00:35.332 --> 00:44.115
and by using the Right Side, the power
of Pingala Nadi, we act.

00:44.316 --> 00:50.321
I was telling you about the Right Side
the other day.

00:50.853 --> 00:55.071
Let us see how our Right Side is built up.

00:55.272 --> 00:58.249
I am sorry for people who have come
for the first time

00:58.450 --> 01:02.347
but every time when I start the introduction
to the subject,

01:02.548 --> 01:09.253
again it becomes the same but later on
I’ll explain to you about Sahaj Yoga.

01:10.142 --> 01:25.430
Now this Right Side, Pingala Nadi, is a
very, very important energy-giving energy

01:26.438 --> 01:30.893
which makes us act and activate.

01:31.094 --> 01:37.475
Now this one is made of all the five
elements:

01:38.096 --> 01:41.343
you know all the five elements that have
created

01:41.544 --> 01:46.061
our physical being and our mental being.

01:46.262 --> 01:54.599
That’s how it helps us to work out all
our physical and mental problems,

01:54.800 --> 02:01.618
mental activities and mental and physical
growth.

02:03.706 --> 02:10.730
Now this, being made by those five
elements,

02:10.931 --> 02:16.361
when, first time, human beings started
thinking

02:16.576 --> 02:25.777
of doing some action, about anything,
say in India,

02:25.978 --> 02:28.322
they first thought, “Why not, somehow
or other,

02:28.523 --> 02:32.697
reach to the principle of these elements,

02:32.898 --> 02:37.997
which is beyond physics, which is beyond
chemistry?”

02:38.198 --> 02:42.564
And to reach to that point,

02:43.640 --> 02:51.356
they thought it would be better if we try
to invoke

02:51.557 --> 02:59.915
or to awaken the Deities which are
governing those five elements.

03:00.116 --> 03:03.960
This was a very big mistake though,
I should say,

03:04.160 --> 03:08.155
because human beings, whatever they
take up,

03:08.356 --> 03:11.500
they do not know where to stop!

03:11.701 --> 03:17.904
If you tell them that you have to clean
your teeth every day,

03:18.105 --> 03:23.760
then they’ll go on cleaning it twelve times
in twelve hours.

03:23.961 --> 03:27.764
[If] you tell them anything, they’ll go
so far

03:27.965 --> 03:35.000
that they will destroy the instrument which
is supposed to be looked after.

03:35.201 --> 03:40.332
That’s the nature of human beings: they
cannot have brakes to themselves.

03:40.533 --> 03:46.135
They do not have common sense as far as
balancing their life.

03:46.336 --> 03:56.200
So, anything you give them, they become
so mad after it

03:56.401 --> 03:59.082
that, in Marathi, there’s a word

03:59.282 --> 04:01.767
that [means that] they ultimately put ashes
on their head,

04:01.968 --> 04:06.113
to say, to declare that, “I am dead now,
I have become ashes.”

04:06.314 --> 04:09.269
Like that, they get so frantic

04:09.470 --> 04:13.483
that even while doing this awakening
of these principles

04:13.684 --> 04:17.530
they forgot, lost their sight,

04:17.731 --> 04:21.280
that we are after all Spirit and not
these elements.

04:21.481 --> 04:24.988
We are beyond that, we have to reach beyond
that.

04:25.189 --> 04:29.052
All these elements are only useful for us

04:29.253 --> 04:37.401
to achieve a state in which we can create
things

04:37.602 --> 04:41.835
and we can have more time to devote

04:42.036 --> 04:46.838
to meditation to enjoy our Self-realisation.

04:47.039 --> 04:54.459
They got completely blinded by the advances
they made on this side

04:54.660 --> 05:00.038
which is, in pure and simple words,
materialism.

05:00.418 --> 05:05.632
They became so responsible, so efficient.

05:05.877 --> 05:13.297
First in the Vedas, it’s written, the first
stanza is such that,

05:13.498 --> 05:19.372
“By reading these Vedas if you do not know

05:19.573 --> 05:22.846
your Spirit then it is absolutely useless.”

05:23.047 --> 05:26.051
But this stanza they always close down
I think.

05:26.252 --> 05:28.911
Then they started worshipping those
Deities, this, that,

05:29.112 --> 05:32.429
exciting them and doing all ritualism
and all that.

05:32.630 --> 05:36.966
And they just went into it headlong,
absolutely headlong.

05:37.167 --> 05:40.572
They would not turn back.

05:41.858 --> 05:44.171
So by exciting these elements,

05:44.372 --> 05:48.063
they discovered the principles of these
elements;

05:48.264 --> 05:53.651
for example, they discovered that gravity
is the essence of the Mother Earth.

05:53.852 --> 05:57.002
But [actually] it is not.

05:57.203 --> 05:59.933
That is not the essence of the Mother
Earth,

06:00.134 --> 06:03.880
that is the energy that is asserted by Her,

06:04.080 --> 06:07.329
but Her essence is Her fragrance.

06:07.530 --> 06:12.906
They could not cross that limit where they
could see really the subtle thing

06:13.115 --> 06:19.438
which was [that] the subtle principle
of this energy

06:19.639 --> 06:24.733
of gravity is the fragrance.

06:24.934 --> 06:28.077
All the fragrances come from Her.

06:28.278 --> 06:31.263
Of course man-made [fragrances] there are,
that’s different,

06:31.464 --> 06:34.843
but even the man-made are also coming
from Her,

06:35.044 --> 06:40.205
if you go, trace, source it up to the point,
it is from there.

06:40.406 --> 06:46.874
Like that they went on discovering
the subtler, so-called subtler, energies

06:47.075 --> 06:51.777
or the principles of these elements, from
the Vedas time.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.701
Then it became the science.

06:53.902 --> 06:57.666
People started studying physics, chemistry,
this, that:

06:57.867 --> 07:02.619
understanding what was there before them

07:02.820 --> 07:09.203
by going into it and trying to find out
what is it made of.

07:09.404 --> 07:13.184
For example, they went into atoms,

07:13.384 --> 07:18.554
they went into molecules and things and
they tried to find out.

07:18.755 --> 07:24.308
And there they find the oscillation
of the protons

07:24.509 --> 07:29.345
and they find the oscillation of these
atoms  [and] they just can’t understand,

07:29.546 --> 07:35.432
“Now, from where this energy of this
oscillation is coming?”

07:36.115 --> 07:40.681
They could not capture that energy so they
thought,

07:40.882 --> 07:45.355
“Better use the energy.” So they started
using the energy.

07:45.577 --> 07:48.072
Now it has gone to such a limit of the
whole thing is,

07:48.273 --> 07:53.172
now I read, saw that, microchips or
something coming up.

07:53.373 --> 07:58.594
After some time you won’t be using (your)
hands or head or anything,

07:58.795 --> 08:01.258
it will be that microchips will be going
on.

08:01.459 --> 08:04.624
But with this kind of a thing, with this
extreme behaviour,

08:04.825 --> 08:08.204
you will become a machine yourself, a slave
of the machine.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.976
Today the petrol is exhausted, tomorrow
electricity is exhausted,

08:12.218 --> 08:16.787
then what are you going to do? You don’t
know even to count two plus two!

08:16.988 --> 08:19.247
So you are left without any counting.

08:19.448 --> 08:21.551
You will become the same primitive man

08:21.752 --> 08:24.688
and I don’t know what you will be doing,

08:24.889 --> 08:27.484
climbing on the trees and living like
monkeys?

08:27.684 --> 08:30.641
I don’t know what will happen.

08:30.842 --> 08:36.510
So all this advancement that you did has
gone too far.

08:36.711 --> 08:42.708
But as a result of too much efficiency,
too much responsibility and all that,

08:42.909 --> 08:45.423
you became sort of addicted to it

08:45.624 --> 08:50.238
and then, with that, you started dominating
other people.

08:50.439 --> 08:54.890
The machinery came in; with that you
produced such a lot of machinery stuff

08:55.091 --> 08:57.096
that you didn’t know what to do, so you had
to find out

08:57.297 --> 08:59.852
markets where you’ll sell them, so you
started

09:00.053 --> 09:02.716
capturing other markets where you started
selling them

09:02.946 --> 09:06.483
and that’s how all these economic problems
and all these have started.

09:06.684 --> 09:08.817
There are developing countries, there are
developed countries,

09:09.018 --> 09:12.690
all things going on in this mad world.
All right!

09:12.891 --> 09:16.951
But we reach a point now where we realise

09:17.152 --> 09:21.446
that this machine has done something
nonsensical within us.

09:21.647 --> 09:23.228
When we reach that point,

09:23.428 --> 09:27.130
we start thinking, “Now, what are we
to do?”

09:27.331 --> 09:29.428
We have been very responsible,

09:29.629 --> 09:32.376
not you people but your forefathers maybe,

09:32.577 --> 09:35.899
who went to fight the whole world and do
this

09:36.099 --> 09:40.862
and they had to be at right time at right
places and do all sorts of things.

09:41.063 --> 09:46.818
By that over-responsibility you became
sort of fed up.

09:47.019 --> 09:50.949
You just didn’t know what to do. For
example, morning you wear a grey suit,

09:51.150 --> 09:53.438
in the night you have to wear a tailcoat

09:53.639 --> 09:56.009
and then if you have to drink your wine,

09:56.209 --> 09:58.861
you have to take a separate glass;
or for that, this.

09:59.062 --> 10:03.731
It became too much messy, [so] you said,
“Throw them in the sea!

10:03.932 --> 10:05.803
We’re not going to have all this nonsense.

10:06.004 --> 10:07.567
We have collected all these forms

10:07.767 --> 10:10.239
and horrible things that have made us
so rigid.”

10:10.462 --> 10:12.749
That’s how you tried to throw away
everything.

10:12.950 --> 10:15.929
But even then when you throw away, where
do you go?

10:16.130 --> 10:19.374
I mean you have to exist, you cannot just
hang in the air.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.325
So you said now take another style.

10:21.526 --> 10:26.358
And the another style is even worse, much
worse.

10:26.559 --> 10:34.055
Because then: no responsibility, no
respect, no understanding.

10:34.256 --> 10:39.422
So this power goes absolutely zero and you
are tired very soon.

10:39.623 --> 10:43.741
I have seen, I mean in the BBC and all
that, young people,

10:43.941 --> 10:46.872
and I am a very old woman compared to them,

10:47.073 --> 10:52.202
after saying two three words, “Haahh!”
they go down.

10:52.403 --> 10:56.833
Again after saying something, “Haahh!”
This is very big acting these days!

10:57.034 --> 11:00.940
In any play you see a person says, “Haahh!”

11:01.141 --> 11:04.264
What does it take to act for this kind
of a thing?

11:04.465 --> 11:07.498
This is what is very common now, you
notice it.

11:07.699 --> 11:13.446
The reason is you are tired, you are
absolutely tired. Why?

11:13.647 --> 11:19.222
Because your brain is the same old brain

11:19.423 --> 11:24.510
and you have taken a new life, and you
cannot adjust yourself to that.

11:24.710 --> 11:27.168
You say that, “Now I am sitting down,
doing nothing.

11:27.368 --> 11:30.282
I am not going to be efficient anymore and
all that, I’m sitting down,”

11:30.483 --> 11:32.546
[but] the brain is going, “chuk, chuk,
chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,”

11:32.746 --> 11:35.625
morning till evening. How to stop this
brain?

11:35.826 --> 11:38.855
This brain is working so hard, using up all
your energy

11:39.056 --> 11:41.993
[so] you have no strength.

11:42.194 --> 11:45.959
So to counteract you will say, “Let’s take
to some sort of a thing

11:46.160 --> 11:50.576
by which we go out of this madness.”
Let’s take to something

11:50.777 --> 11:55.169
that takes you [to], as we call it,
the Right or the Left Side,

11:55.370 --> 11:59.492
take something like say hasheesh,
or something  —

11:59.693 --> 12:04.769
like another thing they took — LSD, to go
to the right or to the left.

12:04.970 --> 12:07.691
Now what happens with that you know
very well.

12:07.892 --> 12:12.135
Now, thank God, you have realised also
that that was nonsensical also,

12:12.335 --> 12:15.370
that was no good. These are two areas
within us

12:15.571 --> 12:21.130
which are called as Adi Bhautik and
Adi Daivik.

12:21.331 --> 12:25.189
Now, the Adi Bhautik are the ones which
take you

12:25.390 --> 12:28.213
to the Left Side is the subconscious.

12:28.414 --> 12:33.244
And the Adi Daivik are the ones where you
try to invoke the devas

12:33.444 --> 12:36.272
and all that on the right hand side,

12:36.473 --> 12:43.526
that one is the Adi Daivik where we call it
supra-conscious area.

12:43.727 --> 12:47.690
These two are of no use to human beings,
actually.

12:47.891 --> 12:52.417
They are not meant for you. They are meant
for people who are dead,

12:52.618 --> 12:56.470
who are dead souls, who are good
for nothing.

12:56.671 --> 12:58.869
Now, they cannot get Realisation.

12:59.070 --> 13:03.501
It’s not meant for you. That’s the area
you should not reside in.

13:03.702 --> 13:08.689
But you enter into these areas because
of extreme natures.

13:08.890 --> 13:11.581
Some people by going into these drugs,

13:11.782 --> 13:14.171
some [by] taking to some sort of movements

13:14.372 --> 13:18.229
like mesmerism, spiritualism and all sorts
of isms.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.241
Some people onto the right hand side like
taking to

13:21.441 --> 13:25.111
what you call these people who are
racialists

13:25.312 --> 13:29.633
and all such organisations which are
racialist and this and that

13:29.834 --> 13:32.960
and you know all that kind of a people,
like Hitlerish type.

13:33.161 --> 13:37.198
All this is nothing but is a kind of
an intoxicant

13:37.399 --> 13:41.086
which makes you forget the reality that you
are a human being,

13:41.287 --> 13:47.119
that you have to become the Spirit. That
you are the Spirit is the reality.

13:48.334 --> 13:53.667
Now the present trend in the Western life
is very much set

13:53.868 --> 13:57.385
in this country, about which I am very
much concerned.

13:57.586 --> 14:02.706
I have talked about [this] to many people
in person, and also otherwise,

14:02.907 --> 14:05.288
that the quality of mind —

14:05.489 --> 14:09.248
because we are with the English, let’s
talk about the English people —

14:09.449 --> 14:14.267
quality of mind of English is excellent,
I have said it always.

14:14.468 --> 14:18.972
And the young people of England have
a very good quality of mind,

14:19.173 --> 14:23.171
but their heart is like this.

14:23.372 --> 14:26.564
They are frightened of what? God alone
knows, but they are frightened.

14:26.765 --> 14:29.623
Or they have taken this course? I don’t
know.

14:29.824 --> 14:32.348
Now to do any work, also they are
frightened.

14:32.549 --> 14:36.014
Supposing we put this colour then it may
not match:

14:36.215 --> 14:39.437
[if] it doesn’t match it doesn’t matter.
What does it matter?

14:39.638 --> 14:46.043
Because of those previous ideas they are
so frightened of doing anything.

14:46.244 --> 14:48.485
Though they say they have broken all
those ideas

14:48.686 --> 14:51.311
and they have taken to a new liberated
ways and all that.

14:51.512 --> 14:54.158
But this liberation is also another madness

14:54.359 --> 14:56.951
in which their fear has not gone.

14:57.152 --> 15:00.041
So the quality of mind

15:00.242 --> 15:05.475
of we the English Sahaja Yogis and English
people is excellent.

15:05.676 --> 15:08.574
If you talk to them you will think you are
talking to a scholar;

15:08.775 --> 15:11.588
I mean no less than Shakespeare!

15:11.791 --> 15:13.819
They could be very well read.

15:14.028 --> 15:16.678
They will know about anything you ask them,
“What is this road?”

15:16.879 --> 15:20.071
“This is the road!” “Now, what’s the name
of this road?” “This is the gentleman.”

15:20.272 --> 15:22.127
Who was he, his grandfather, what he did,

15:22.327 --> 15:25.797
what was the gossip about him, scandals,
everything!

15:25.998 --> 15:32.275
You can get everything from them. They
know everything about everything.

15:32.664 --> 15:36.225
Sometimes I am amazed the way people know
about things,

15:36.426 --> 15:39.320
about all the details as to how many women
he had,

15:39.520 --> 15:42.142
and how many wives he divorced and what
he did

15:42.343 --> 15:45.859
and where he went and what he wrote.
Take anyone!

15:46.060 --> 15:51.252
Take a writer, or take an artist, take
a hooligan, or take a robber

15:51.453 --> 15:54.145
or anyone who has appeared on
the newspaper.

15:54.345 --> 15:57.174
As if they have drunk all the newspaper
into their memory.

15:57.375 --> 16:01.522
The whole thing is so clear cut in their
mind that it’s sometimes amazing.

16:01.723 --> 16:07.049
But if you tell them to fix one chair,

16:07.250 --> 16:10.768
never trust that chair!

16:12.179 --> 16:14.126
Never trust it!

16:14.327 --> 16:18.027
If you ask them to do anything, they’ll
tell you,

16:18.228 --> 16:21.773
“All right, tomorrow at 7 sharp, I’ll be
there!”

16:21.980 --> 16:27.059
Even if he comes after seven days, thank
your [lucky] stars!

16:27.372 --> 16:30.678
I have known people who have done this
to me

16:30.879 --> 16:34.469
[and] now it’s four years, I have never
seen their faces again.

16:34.670 --> 16:43.784
They are supposed to be XYZ from Oxford
and ABCD from Cambridge.

16:43.985 --> 16:46.360
They have got first class first and this
and that

16:46.561 --> 16:50.210
[but] if you go into their rooms, you will
find it’s a pigsty!

16:50.410 --> 16:52.909
You don’t know where you have landed.

16:53.110 --> 16:56.641
I mean, you don’t believe that it belongs
to any educated person!

16:56.842 --> 17:00.102
There’s no sense of responsibility left
in their head.

17:00.303 --> 17:02.870
I mean this energy that is working
in the head,

17:03.071 --> 17:06.976
if it is not put into a responsible
channel,

17:07.177 --> 17:11.196
[then it’s] no wonder we find every third
person is a paranoid:

17:11.397 --> 17:12.703
something wrong with the brain.

17:12.904 --> 17:15.957
What is wrong with the brain is that
so much energy is here

17:16.158 --> 17:18.236
and you are not channelising it at all!

17:18.437 --> 17:23.597
By what ways are we to channelise it?

17:23.798 --> 17:30.263
Even after realisation, I find people have
no respect for anything.

17:30.464 --> 17:34.596
Sometimes it’s most surprising that wit
all this brain activity going on,

17:34.797 --> 17:37.343
they get all the satisfaction from
the Spirit,

17:37.544 --> 17:39.543
they are raising the Kundalini and all
that,

17:39.744 --> 17:44.858
but they have lost that capacity to be
responsible.

17:45.059 --> 17:48.595
And that’s why, in Sahaja Yoga also, they
are not responsible.

17:48.796 --> 17:52.801
This goes on not only about their own
private work

17:53.001 --> 17:55.797
but about Sahaja Yoga, about everything.

17:55.998 --> 17:59.167
So this quality of mind has no heart.

17:59.368 --> 18:02.136
It has heart in nothing!

18:02.337 --> 18:05.804
Supposing I am telling you something: I
don’t know about Sahaja Yogis as such,

18:06.005 --> 18:08.176
but now I have seen with people,

18:08.377 --> 18:12.620
[if] you give them a lecture for one year,
one hour, it’s lost, finished!

18:12.821 --> 18:15.414
They are just the same! What has happened?

18:15.615 --> 18:19.334
It’s only the vibrations, it’s only how you
work it out

18:19.535 --> 18:21.214
that the life changes and all that.

18:21.415 --> 18:24.678
But as far as they are concerned, nothing
is recorded in the memory.

18:24.879 --> 18:29.278
Sometimes I feel how do I talk? Is it
too much on their heads

18:29.479 --> 18:32.213
or below their feet? Where is it flowing?

18:32.414 --> 18:37.026
So the reason is that the heart is not
there.

18:37.227 --> 18:41.934
If you register it through your heart, you
will do it.

18:42.135 --> 18:45.867
If you put your heart into things, you will
do it.

18:46.068 --> 18:50.777
The heart is, as I told you, is chicken-
hearted,

18:50.978 --> 18:53.312
is absolutely chicken-hearted.

18:53.513 --> 18:57.570
And that’s why, this is what is lacking in
our character.

18:57.771 --> 19:01.845
For that now the stage has reached

19:02.046 --> 19:05.530
[that] we have to raise our Right Side, not
the Left Side.

19:05.731 --> 19:08.058
Our Right Side is absolutely finished

19:08.259 --> 19:11.993
and there the leader of the Right Side are
two persons.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.398
The Deities are two persons.

19:14.599 --> 19:17.016
Of course Brahmadeva is the one who
is The Creator,

19:17.217 --> 19:21.180
who has created this Universe and who
is The One who is busy

19:21.381 --> 19:25.036
still creating and doing lots of things
for you people.

19:25.237 --> 19:29.541
But I would suggest that you have to pay
attention

19:29.742 --> 19:33.452
to two ideals we had in the history,

19:33.653 --> 19:36.557
for this, to understand what sort of ideals
we should have.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.241
Because the Right Side is a Rajoguna

19:39.442 --> 19:44.741
is the one by which you become majestic,
you become royal,

19:44.942 --> 19:48.528
you achieve all the Rajoguna as you know
that.

19:48.729 --> 19:53.819
Now two persons are really to be followed
in this.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.432
One of them is Shri Ram.

19:56.633 --> 20:02.797
Shri Ram resides on the Right Heart and
is the Father.

20:02.998 --> 20:07.099
He is the Father and He is the fatherhood.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.758
He is the one who came on this Earth
to teach us

20:09.959 --> 20:13.290
how to be a father as a king.

20:13.490 --> 20:16.120
He is a Father King, He is a Benevolent
King,

20:16.321 --> 20:21.609
which was described before by Plato.
He is the Benevolent King.

20:21.810 --> 20:25.123
He was the ideal that came on this Earth
to teach us

20:25.324 --> 20:32.280
how to be responsible to others, how
to respect others,

20:32.481 --> 20:36.151
how to understand the feelings of others.

20:36.352 --> 20:42.754
To such an extent He went, that He had
to sacrifice

20:42.955 --> 20:48.549
His own wife for the sake of His own state.

20:48.749 --> 20:53.297
He did that and He had to ask His wife
who was pregnant

20:53.498 --> 20:58.912
to go and live with a very great sage.

20:59.113 --> 21:03.596
One may say that, “What was He doing
about His wife?”

21:03.797 --> 21:06.481
She was the Goddess.

21:06.695 --> 21:09.510
She was so remarkable that He was not
bothered about Her.

21:09.711 --> 21:12.920
He was so sure of Her powers that He
did it.

21:13.121 --> 21:16.757
And there is nothing wrong in leaving
things to the Goddess to do,

21:16.958 --> 21:19.113
instead of meddling with Her all the time.

21:19.314 --> 21:28.827
But this gentleman, Shri Rama, understood
the responsibility of a king

21:29.028 --> 21:32.308
and that responsibility is lacking in us:

21:32.509 --> 21:36.048
that responsibility towards ourselves and
towards others.

21:36.249 --> 21:41.880
It is very, very surprising. I mean, I came
from India.

21:42.081 --> 21:46.249
I had never met Englishmen at this close
quarters

21:46.450 --> 21:48.207
till I came to England, I should say,

21:48.408 --> 21:51.029
because before that all we met was
missionaries.

21:51.230 --> 21:54.035
All missionaries were terribly responsible

21:54.236 --> 21:57.180
for converting all the people into
Christianity.

21:57.381 --> 21:59.627
They would get up early in the morning,
take their Bible,

21:59.853 --> 22:04.037
go around to all the places, clean all
the dirty lanes

22:04.238 --> 22:07.112
and clean all the children like Pickwick
Papers, you see!

22:07.313 --> 22:10.942
Clean all the dirty people there, kiss them

22:11.143 --> 22:13.840
and do all the impressive things to convert
the people.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.828
They would go even to the forest to convert
them.

22:17.029 --> 22:20.206
They were so responsible about it and they
felt they have to do it,

22:20.407 --> 22:23.296
this is God’s job, they are doing God’s
job, they must convert.

22:23.497 --> 22:27.130
And they went on with this and that’s how,
some of the people I met.

22:27.331 --> 22:30.915
Then the rulers were extremely responsible.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.897
They were ruthless and they thought this
was the greatest thing they were doing,

22:34.098 --> 22:37.318
was to spread British Raj and that was
their responsibility.

22:37.519 --> 22:41.444
When it comes to spreading God’s Raj
we are not.

22:41.645 --> 22:45.796
First of all in our own life, we should
see, “Are we responsible?”

22:45.997 --> 22:48.007
Now, in the modern time, I find

22:48.208 --> 22:52.670
that we have got rid of that sense
of responsibility.

22:52.870 --> 22:56.982
It’s called as a sense of diminishing
responsibility.

22:57.183 --> 23:02.488
We’ll just say, “Yes, yes, I know.
I shouldn’t. I know, I know.”

23:03.641 --> 23:07.015
I can’t understand: if you have a heart,
how can you say that

23:07.216 --> 23:10.667
“I know I should not have done it”? “I know
I should have been this.”

23:10.868 --> 23:14.632
The reason is, there is no heart and
the heart always catches

23:14.833 --> 23:16.819
when your Right Side over acts.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.096
That means your brain is acting too much

23:19.297 --> 23:22.465
and there is no real action, the output
of it.

23:22.666 --> 23:27.075
You think too much and do not put it
to practice.

23:27.276 --> 23:29.298
“I should have gone,” “I should have
done this,”

23:29.499 --> 23:34.401
“I should have said so.” And this is
the problem with our Right Side.

23:34.602 --> 23:38.133
Now, among our Sahaja Yogis also, I find

23:38.334 --> 23:41.668
people have the problem of the Right Side.

23:41.869 --> 23:46.749
To worship the Right Side, we have to see
to Shri Ram:

23:46.950 --> 23:50.218
How He felt responsible for the whole
world,

23:50.419 --> 23:52.342
how He used to look after people,

23:52.543 --> 23:55.321
how He looked after the things of other
people,

23:55.522 --> 23:57.923
how He behaved towards other people.

23:58.124 --> 24:01.206
That’s a very important thing which we
have to learn.

24:01.407 --> 24:05.191
But I find people coming, if it is somebody
else’s, they’ll throw away.

24:05.392 --> 24:08.640
They will just jump into something and
say that,

24:08.840 --> 24:12.466
“All right, this is my house, I just settle
down here the way I like.”

24:12.667 --> 24:15.530
There’s no sense of responsibility at all
about it,

24:15.731 --> 24:18.016
that you have come to somebody else’s
house,

24:18.217 --> 24:19.907
you have to have some care about it.

24:20.108 --> 24:24.637
In the same way you have to know you have
come in the world of God,

24:24.849 --> 24:28.647
this is the Kingdom of God where you have
entered.

24:28.848 --> 24:32.332
You have been a stranger. Today you are
a guest in His house,

24:32.533 --> 24:34.739
what are you doing about it?

24:34.940 --> 24:38.344
How are you behaving? Are you responsible?

24:38.545 --> 24:42.596
Are you like Shri Rama who took upon
Himself

24:42.796 --> 24:47.571
all the problems of the world and still He
was so responsible?

24:47.772 --> 24:51.933
He would not do anything even this much
to disturb a person.

24:52.134 --> 24:58.076
As far as possible He would like to try
to console,

24:58.277 --> 25:01.717
and to have the formalities of good living.

25:01.918 --> 25:05.059
Formality is meant for good living and
good understanding.

25:05.260 --> 25:08.790
Unless and until you have this sense
of responsibility,

25:08.990 --> 25:11.981
your collectivity cannot be all right.

25:12.183 --> 25:14.640
You cannot be collectively all right.

25:14.841 --> 25:18.144
You need not be a machine for that.
There is no need to be a machine,

25:18.345 --> 25:21.171
like Japanese — only one person says,
the another doesn’t talk.

25:21.372 --> 25:24.620
But this one kind of a funny individualism
that you have got

25:24.821 --> 25:31.780
will never give you that collectivity that
is expected of Sahaj Yogis.

25:31.980 --> 25:37.492
We all have to be one, being responsible
for each other.

25:37.693 --> 25:39.959
Not only for one or two persons, because
he is my friend,

25:40.159 --> 25:43.732
he is my husband, she is my wife but
for all of us.

25:43.933 --> 25:47.245
We have to be responsible for them,
for their things, for their children,

25:47.446 --> 25:51.345
for their house, for everything. We have
to be responsible.

25:51.546 --> 25:54.032
And if this sense of responsibility is
lacking,

25:54.233 --> 25:59.619
how will you have responsibility for your
Self-realisation?

26:00.285 --> 26:03.191
Only it can be a self-centred thing,
thinking that,

26:03.392 --> 26:07.997
“I am very much better, my powers are
better. I must have more powers.”

26:08.198 --> 26:10.794
But if you do not have this sense
of responsibility

26:10.995 --> 26:15.094
why should God also give you powers?

26:16.624 --> 26:20.019
The main thing is, your Right Side is
completely weakened,

26:20.220 --> 26:26.280
that is the Surya Nadi, that is the nadi
which is called as the nadi

26:26.481 --> 26:30.440
by which people hold their prana. So it
gives you the pranashakti.

26:30.641 --> 26:35.066
It’s the pranashakti within you which is
the vital force of energy within you,

26:35.267 --> 26:41.269
which is lacking. Now this lacking is added
up by your heart.

26:41.470 --> 26:45.362
At least for a man like that whose
pranashakti is exhausted.

26:45.563 --> 26:48.033
At least for such a man if the heart is
there,

26:48.234 --> 26:53.157
he can really use that power which is
accumulating in the head

26:53.358 --> 26:57.613
and exhausting him, like eating up
his brain,

26:57.814 --> 26:59.611
if he has the heart in him.

26:59.812 --> 27:02.079
Now this is what I have told you last time

27:02.280 --> 27:06.639
that the Right Side of human beings
is very important

27:06.840 --> 27:10.260
when it comes to Sahaj Yoga.

27:10.994 --> 27:12.908
Because, when the Kundalini rises,

27:13.229 --> 27:18.714
your Right Side is also, Right Side is also
awakened.

27:18.915 --> 27:23.021
Now the question is: why Sahaja Yoga does
not spread in England so fast?

27:23.222 --> 27:25.526
Is a very good question many people have
asked me.

27:25.727 --> 27:29.079
While in Australia it spreads so fast.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.002
The reason is the Right Side is missing.

27:33.203 --> 27:35.297
For the Right Side to be awakened

27:35.498 --> 27:37.321
first of all there should be some Right
Side!

27:37.522 --> 27:40.118
If there is no Right Side, what do you
awaken?

27:40.319 --> 27:43.154
If there is no light at all what are you
going to awaken?

27:43.355 --> 27:45.922
There has to be a lamp to be awakened.

27:46.123 --> 27:50.591
So all these topics and talks that we have
in the society,

27:50.792 --> 27:55.722
“I know! I know!” and then you ask them
they just say, “I don’t know!”

27:55.923 --> 28:01.998
“How are you?” Like that. All these accents
and all that, one should give up.

28:02.199 --> 28:05.099
One should know that you have to be
responsible:

28:05.300 --> 28:08.692
that’s a very, very important thing
of life.

28:08.893 --> 28:12.829
I personally think, unless and until you
feel that responsibility,

28:13.030 --> 28:16.363
that heart into Sahaja Yoga, you will enjoy
just my talk

28:16.564 --> 28:19.938
as you would just enjoy anything else.

28:20.139 --> 28:27.732
Real enjoyment comes when your Spirit
really blows out the vibrations.

28:27.970 --> 28:31.765
You are taking my vibrations, all right, you
are feeling them, but what about yours?

28:31.966 --> 28:35.387
Are you blowing your vibrations out or they
are just eating your brain?

28:35.588 --> 28:40.277
Simple questions is, are you blowing any
vibrations outside?

28:40.478 --> 28:43.903
We have some Sahaja Yogis when they just
enter into a house

28:44.104 --> 28:51.522
immediately everyone feels it. Everyone
can feel it that somebody has come.

28:51.723 --> 28:55.519
Immediately the whole thing cools down
in no time. Somebody has come.

28:55.720 --> 29:00.826
There are some here also, not that there
are none, but they are few people.

29:01.027 --> 29:05.897
You have to blow out vibrations otherwise
you are just a liability to yourself.

29:06.098 --> 29:09.975
Why don’t you blow out vibrations? Because
you don’t feel responsible.

29:10.176 --> 29:12.811
In your day-to-day life, morning till
evening, you have to see

29:13.011 --> 29:17.391
that you develop this instrument of
responsibility within you,

29:17.592 --> 29:21.758
otherwise the vibrations won’t flow
because, the main reason is

29:21.959 --> 29:30.159
that our nervous system comes to us through
our Right Side.

29:31.524 --> 29:36.839
Our nervous system is built up by our
Right Side.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.881
All the elements within us have built [it]
up. If the elements are weakened,

29:41.082 --> 29:43.343
if the chakras which are made by these
elements —

29:43.543 --> 29:46.800
as you know all these chakras are made
by elements —

29:47.001 --> 29:50.661
if the pot is weak, nothing is going
to work out.

29:50.862 --> 29:57.161
You should be able to hold that water
of love

29:57.362 --> 30:00.163
or you can say the water of bliss

30:00.364 --> 30:02.694
and should be able to pour it out
to others.

30:02.902 --> 30:06.952
Unless and until you are able to do that,
Sahaja Yoga won’t spread.

30:07.163 --> 30:09.569
It will spread very slowly.

30:09.770 --> 30:15.642
This is the difference, I feel, between
English and Australians,

30:16.306 --> 30:19.648
that the quality of mind is thousands times
better than Australians.

30:19.856 --> 30:24.824
They are not scholars. I found very few
people there who are even graduates.

30:25.025 --> 30:29.292
Here everybody is a PhD or maybe a ‘MAD’:

30:29.493 --> 30:32.284
but they are all very well educated.

30:32.485 --> 30:36.337
Despite all that, Sahaj Yoga does not
spread out, why?

30:36.538 --> 30:39.087
The reason is the quality of mind is good

30:39.288 --> 30:42.152
but the action is extremely poor,

30:42.353 --> 30:45.166
because you are exhausted, tired, you are
fighting in the mind.

30:45.367 --> 30:50.597
You are not doing anything by which you
blow it out.

30:50.798 --> 30:58.997
The Right Side is what you call the
Brahma’s, Brahmadeva’s, creation

30:59.198 --> 31:02.928
and the Brahma Shakti as they call it.

31:03.129 --> 31:06.777
This is the power of Brahma which is
flowing through you.

31:06.978 --> 31:09.374
Wec all it the power of the Spirit.

31:09.575 --> 31:13.056
It’s true, but the Spirit, the power
of the Spirit,

31:13.256 --> 31:16.526
flows on your central nervous system.

31:16.727 --> 31:21.833
If there is the electricity all stored up
here and there are very weak wires

31:22.034 --> 31:24.876
what can you do with all that stored up
energy?

31:25.077 --> 31:27.243
The wires have to be improved and for
this wire

31:27.443 --> 31:32.348
your Right Side has to be improved
immensely.

31:32.584 --> 31:38.017
Every minute you have to be responsible,
and this is what is lacking.

31:38.218 --> 31:43.268
Then I find when some people who are
responsible, they feel extremely hurt

31:43.469 --> 31:48.006
and they feel that they should really shout
and scream and should do something.

31:48.207 --> 31:51.726
hey don’t know that these are really
the saints, they are realised souls.

31:51.927 --> 31:57.830
They are great people, no doubt, but their
Right Side is weakened.

31:58.031 --> 32:00.773
But that is not a great thing to accept,
it’s a very bad thing.

32:00.974 --> 32:03.537
But that doesn’t mean you should feel
guilty — again, I am saying.

32:03.738 --> 32:07.709
Because very nice! This is the way we
manage: is to feel guilty.

32:07.910 --> 32:11.099
Because feeling guilty is the best way,
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

32:11.300 --> 32:15.680
I should have done it. I know, I know,
I know!” — finished!

32:16.432 --> 32:18.527
Then how can you improve? If you have
a pouch here

32:18.728 --> 32:24.993
filled up (of guilt in Left Vishuddhi) all
the time with responsibility denied,

32:25.194 --> 32:28.825
all the junk you have created out of that,
you are pushing into that pouch

32:29.026 --> 32:33.170
and then you say, “Yes, yes, I know,
I should not have done it!”

32:33.371 --> 32:35.383
Now what can you do? As a Mother
you can’t say,

32:35.584 --> 32:39.704
“You hang yourself by the nearest tree!”
What do I do?

32:39.905 --> 32:42.318
But I just look at you flabbergasted,
I said, “Really?”

32:42.519 --> 32:44.675
He said: “Yes, I should have done but
I haven’t done it.”

32:44.876 --> 32:50.335
For example, I tell somebody you’d better
cook for ten people, they are coming. (...)

32:51.710 --> 32:55.078
That’s how you are at a standstill and you
really don’t know how to deal with them!

32:55.279 --> 32:59.762
The point is: in all this talking of Spirit
and God,

32:59.963 --> 33:02.863
one has to know [that] the vehicle has
to be better.

33:03.064 --> 33:06.630
The vehicle is so very poor that it cannot
carry:

33:06.831 --> 33:10.028
otherwise you will emit vibrations like
this. I know you can.

33:10.229 --> 33:13.224
Wherever you will stand you’ll attract
people.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.898
People must gather round you! You will
be amazed,

33:16.099 --> 33:18.639
I went to Australia for how many months?

33:18.840 --> 33:21.984
At the most a month or so, and I came back
from there:

33:22.185 --> 33:24.329
already seven centres have started

33:24.530 --> 33:30.916
and every centre has got at least three
hundred regular people coming!

33:35.466 --> 33:39.067
It is not to feel guilty: I am not saying
[for that],

33:39.268 --> 33:45.014
but to awaken yourself, to arise to this
point,

33:45.215 --> 33:50.156
to be elated with understanding that you
have to rise up to that point

33:50.356 --> 33:52.311
and that you have to take up that position

33:52.512 --> 33:54.864
because you are the warriors of Truth.

33:55.065 --> 33:58.130
You are the people who are seekers, you
have been for ages,

33:58.331 --> 34:03.641
and you have no business to be
irresponsible and you have to do it.

34:03.842 --> 34:09.853
It is my earnest desire that you understand
what I am saying.

34:10.054 --> 34:12.737
Just sitting, meditating, putting hands
towards me

34:12.938 --> 34:15.867
or towards the photograph is not
everything.

34:16.068 --> 34:19.029
You are still receiving. You are still
at a receiving end.

34:19.230 --> 34:22.364
You have to be on the giving end. How
will you do it?

34:22.565 --> 34:27.096
You get so many vibrations sometimes
that you cannot feel after some time,

34:27.297 --> 34:29.218
it’s so filled, the pitcher is so much
filled.

34:29.419 --> 34:34.067
But what about pouring it out? Why you
cannot pour it out?

34:34.268 --> 34:36.666
The reason is that the vehicle within you,

34:36.866 --> 34:41.905
which is the Right Side, is the Pingala
Nadi, is out of gear.

34:42.430 --> 34:44.858
And this is what one has to understand.

34:45.059 --> 34:47.730
That can be built up only when you know

34:47.931 --> 34:50.495
about Shri Rama’s life, the way He led
His life.

34:50.696 --> 34:54.277
Every minute of His life was dynamic.

34:54.478 --> 34:58.676
Not a single minute He wasted in life.

34:58.890 --> 35:02.448
Every minute, whether He was in the forest
or…

35:02.649 --> 35:08.882
He went to a place with His wife when He
was in exile,

35:09.083 --> 35:12.061
and there — He knew His wife was a very
shy lady

35:12.261 --> 35:15.710
and She would not take Her bath in
the open.

35:15.911 --> 35:19.267
So there’s a rock which is completely
honed out,

35:19.468 --> 35:22.377
such a big rock honed out, can you imagine?
(a place called Sitanani near Rahuri)

35:22.578 --> 35:28.124
Inside, there is a water tap sort of
a thing coming out,

35:28.324 --> 35:32.730
there’s a water coming out. So there’s
a stone here,

35:32.931 --> 35:36.755
stone here, stone there, and at the end
of it there’s an opening

35:36.956 --> 35:40.276
so that there’s light coming from this side
and light coming from this side.

35:40.477 --> 35:42.380
But inside [if] you go, nobody can see you.

35:42.581 --> 35:44.517
There are trees with which it is hidden.

35:44.718 --> 35:47.358
There are trees which are called as
shikakai (used as hair shampoo)

35:47.559 --> 35:52.360
means that’s a kind of a soap giving trees,
are created by Him for His wife.

35:52.576 --> 35:55.535
Anywhere He lived He created a new
dimension,

35:55.735 --> 36:00.645
a new house, a new style of life.

36:00.873 --> 36:03.548
Of course He was an incarnation you can
say.

36:03.757 --> 36:09.357
But He is your ideal and not those people
who sit out for hours together

36:09.557 --> 36:14.073
drinking something and thinking they are
great martyrs.

36:14.274 --> 36:16.956
I see all of them sitting near our church
here

36:17.157 --> 36:19.310
and one of them was asked by someone
who was passing by,

36:19.511 --> 36:23.670
“What are you doing?” “We are killing
ourselves!”

36:23.871 --> 36:26.815
Very proudly saying that! I mean I just
don’t understand,

36:27.016 --> 36:29.065
what business have they got to kill
themselves?

36:29.266 --> 36:31.367
How much time it has taken God to create
them?

36:31.568 --> 36:37.367
And here they are sitting and proudly
telling that, “We are killing ourselves!”

36:38.123 --> 36:41.730
This is the situation in which I suddenly
find myself.

36:41.931 --> 36:45.614
So I ask you what should I do? How should
I do?

36:45.815 --> 36:52.952
You have to feel responsible in every way
of life.

36:53.153 --> 36:55.657
But you do not think that there is anything
wrong

36:55.858 --> 36:58.534
if you are a hanky-panky person.

36:58.735 --> 37:01.847
If your feathers are falling everywhere
[you think] it’s all right!

37:02.063 --> 37:06.730
To you it does not matter, but to
the Divine it does.

37:06.931 --> 37:11.522
That means a person cannot convey
the message of God,

37:11.723 --> 37:20.119
cannot communicate the bliss of God,
cannot pour that love.

37:20.634 --> 37:25.155
We have to become very responsible
in everyday life,

37:25.356 --> 37:28.046
I am not saying that [only] in Sahaja Yoga,
but in everyday life,

37:28.247 --> 37:31.932
how you live, what you do. Are you only
worried about yourself

37:32.133 --> 37:35.161
or are you worried about others? Are you
responsible for others?

37:35.362 --> 37:38.651
I mean the modern style is not even to wish
good morning —

37:38.851 --> 37:41.960
is regarded bad manners.

37:42.729 --> 37:46.869
You see, it is bad manners even to open
door to someone, is bad manners,

37:47.088 --> 37:50.124
they think it is slavish. I mean, all
manners and all those things,

37:50.325 --> 37:52.543
all responsibility, seems to be [regarded
as] slavish.

37:52.751 --> 37:55.828
And this kind of these modern ideas that
are floating in the air,

37:56.028 --> 37:58.319
you should throw them away!

37:58.520 --> 38:02.589
And you have to be human beings of a very
great quality.

38:02.790 --> 38:06.684
You have to be people who have created
new worlds.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.292
You are going to create that, I know.

38:09.493 --> 38:12.857
You have to just rise up to that point and
not to sink into your guilts

38:13.058 --> 38:15.550
and say, “Oh God, what we have been
doing?” No!

38:15.751 --> 38:20.955
Awaken and arise and get it what you have
to do.

38:21.156 --> 38:24.587
That’s what I feel about England.

38:24.788 --> 38:29.480
England is so great and it’s the heart,
it’s the heart.

38:29.681 --> 38:32.646
And look at the condition of the heart!

38:32.847 --> 38:42.159
Your heart is so weak, there’s no heart
to anything.

38:43.249 --> 38:46.131
All right, you love me and I love you,

38:46.332 --> 38:50.487
but what about you loving others? And
loving other things?

38:50.688 --> 38:54.830
Loving doesn’t mean writing love letters.

38:55.031 --> 38:58.351
Doing something about it!

38:58.552 --> 39:03.007
And that’s what, the doing something is
missing and lacking.

39:03.208 --> 39:08.092
And that’s what we have to build up our
Right Side properly, into proper shape.

39:08.293 --> 39:11.848
If we have to really do the cooking

39:12.049 --> 39:14.954
we have to know how to light the fire
within us

39:15.155 --> 39:19.271
and not to sit down and worry how to do it.

39:19.487 --> 39:26.259
It is a very great thing to come to
England for me, really, for one reason

39:26.469 --> 39:31.197
that this is the place where Sahaj Yoga
is going to work out.

39:31.398 --> 39:36.588
It is going to circulate in the whole
world, I know, through you people.

39:36.789 --> 39:43.063
But if you do not improve the communication
wires of yours

39:43.264 --> 39:47.656
it will completely stagnate, and the
responsibility of this stagnation

39:47.857 --> 39:50.487
will be on you the Sahaja Yogis of London,

39:50.688 --> 39:56.080
because you did not put your life together,
that’s why it did not work out.

39:56.705 --> 40:00.290
It’s a tremendous responsibility.

40:00.491 --> 40:05.534
Of course, to be responsible is wrong for
wrong things

40:05.735 --> 40:10.685
but not to be responsible for Divine work,

40:10.886 --> 40:13.803
when God has blessed you with
Self-realisation,

40:14.004 --> 40:23.451
is absolutely against God, against your
Self, against Sahaj Yoga.

40:23.652 --> 40:28.734
The other personality which I was talking
about is Shri Hanumana.

40:28.972 --> 40:32.736
Shri Hanumana is such a great powerful
personality

40:32.937 --> 40:35.503
about whom I did not tell you.

40:35.704 --> 40:45.474
That, I mean, Rama once, you see, His
brother was hit by an arrow.

40:45.731 --> 40:49.309
And Rama told Hanumana, that, “Why don’t
you go

40:49.510 --> 40:53.912
and get a particular type of a medicine
for him

40:54.113 --> 40:57.381
and you get it on a particular mountain,

40:57.582 --> 41:00.552
so you go and get that particular thing.”

41:00.753 --> 41:06.062
So he had a power, he had nine powers,
navadha shaktis he had, nine powers:

41:06.262 --> 41:09.484
by which he could become small, he could
become big

41:09.685 --> 41:12.674
and He could lift anything. He had lots
of powers like that,

41:12.875 --> 41:16.720
so nine powers: anima, laghima, garima,
like that.

41:16.921 --> 41:19.288
He could become so heavy that nobody could
lift him (garima).

41:19.489 --> 41:23.306
I mean these are the powers he’s got
of the right hand side.

41:23.507 --> 41:28.358
And so he went down to that mountain

41:28.558 --> 41:31.332
and he couldn’t see that anywhere, he just
couldn’t see.

41:31.533 --> 41:34.623
He said, “Why not take the whole mountain?”

41:34.824 --> 41:37.268
He took the whole mountain on himself and
he brought it to Rama

41:37.469 --> 41:40.953
and he said, “Now you select whichever
you like!”

41:42.282 --> 41:44.092
He could have come back and said, “Oh,
I can’t find!

41:44.293 --> 41:50.502
I am sorry, I know, I have been useless!”
If he was an Englishman!

41:53.963 --> 41:57.230
But he said, “All right, if you want!”
He brought the whole mountain,

41:57.431 --> 42:00.843
“Now come along, have it!” In every way
of his life,

42:01.044 --> 42:05.375
you see his sense of responsibility and how
He carries on.

42:05.576 --> 42:09.433
For example, he was sent to Ravana

42:09.634 --> 42:16.576
and he was asked by Ravana, he told him
that,

42:16.777 --> 42:19.327
“You cannot stay in this place, why did you
come here?”

42:19.528 --> 42:23.963
Actually, first he went to Sita and told
Her that,

42:24.164 --> 42:26.142
“Shri Rama had sent me,” and he showed
the ring,

42:26.343 --> 42:29.386
and She recognised that was the ring
of Her husband.

42:29.587 --> 42:34.117
And he said, “Mother if you want, I can
take you on my back.”

42:34.318 --> 42:38.655
But She said, “No. Already I am a woman
who has come with another man.

42:38.856 --> 42:41.340
You [I?] don’t want to have another bad
name and you’ll have a bad name,

42:41.541 --> 42:44.010
so I will not come. So it’s all right.

42:44.211 --> 42:48.094
You can go back and tell Rama that I am
all right.

42:48.295 --> 42:51.171
‘You as a husband, come and fight this man.

42:51.372 --> 42:53.882
Otherwise I’m not going to come with you.”

42:54.083 --> 42:57.236
So then he was caught up and taken
to Ravana.

42:57.437 --> 43:05.599
Now Ravana said that, “You are a monkey
and what have you come to do it?”

43:05.800 --> 43:09.202
He said that, “You’d better release His
wife of Shri Rama

43:09.403 --> 43:11.222
and He is such and such.”

43:11.423 --> 43:15.686
So He said that, “You monkey, you are
telling me these things?”

43:15.887 --> 43:18.715
“All right,” they said, “burn his tail.”

43:18.916 --> 43:21.044
He said, “If they burn my tail, I know how
to use!”

43:21.245 --> 43:24.277
He knows how the responsibility of the tail
is!

43:24.478 --> 43:27.532
He started burning the whole of Lanka with
his tail

43:27.749 --> 43:32.475
and he could have said that, “All right,
he’s burnt my thing,

43:32.676 --> 43:35.031
I’d better run away! Why to do such
a thing?

43:35.238 --> 43:39.054
You know, better avoid, get out, so
forget it!

43:39.255 --> 43:41.780
I’m not going to go to Rama, he’s burnt
my thing,

43:41.981 --> 43:43.932
tomorrow he will do something else.”

43:44.133 --> 43:47.862
[Instead] he burnt the whole of Lanka,
the whole of it he burnt

43:48.063 --> 43:51.219
till Ravana had to say, that, “Please
forgive and go away.”

43:51.420 --> 43:57.863
He did all kinds of tricks to show that he
was really powerful.

43:58.064 --> 44:00.573
His so many ways of his sense of
responsibility

44:00.773 --> 44:03.691
and his dedication and love is expressed.

44:03.892 --> 44:09.534
But, they say that, even if you take once
his name,

44:09.734 --> 44:14.615
whatever work you want to do, it can be
done.

44:14.816 --> 44:18.577
Any work that you want to be finished
will be done.

44:18.778 --> 44:22.017
And his day is a Tuesday. On Tuesday,

44:22.218 --> 44:25.444
if you request him for anything, he will
help you to do the work.

44:25.645 --> 44:28.517
But it’s not like this that you sit down,
“Now come along Hanumana,

44:28.718 --> 44:32.030
will you please do this job?”

44:32.323 --> 44:35.187
But if you are doing the job, then he comes
to help you.

44:35.388 --> 44:41.393
Means that he activates, he activates and
he makes your energy

44:41.594 --> 44:45.102
flow into that direction that your work
is done.

44:45.314 --> 44:51.380
He’s so helpful in so many ways that you
can’t imagine.

44:51.581 --> 44:54.560
We have so many Sahaja Yogis have tried
it with them.

44:54.761 --> 44:58.439
And he has created such miracles. Specially
the Australians,

44:58.640 --> 45:01.364
somehow they have such a feeling for him,
I know the reason,

45:01.577 --> 45:05.109
but they have such a feeling for him that
every time, anything happening,

45:05.317 --> 45:08.863
they tell Hanumana, “Hanumana, now please
look after us!”

45:09.064 --> 45:12.904
And they have told me that such miraculous
things have happened

45:13.121 --> 45:15.116
since they have been using Shri Hanumana.

45:15.317 --> 45:18.381
But you must have the vehicle to carry
this Hanumana!

45:18.582 --> 45:21.603
He’s a very subtle Deity within you and if
you are irresponsible,

45:21.803 --> 45:26.995
he hates such people, he hates, he just
can’t bear it.

45:27.196 --> 45:31.108
He thinks they are absolutely useless
people!

45:31.309 --> 45:34.336
He doesn’t pay attention to such people,
those who are not responsible.

45:34.537 --> 45:36.554
They may give any excuses, they may
show off,

45:36.754 --> 45:39.662
they may do anything, [but] he just doesn’t
care for such people.

45:39.863 --> 45:47.174
He has no love, no respect, no attention
for the people who are not responsible.

45:47.375 --> 45:52.092
There’s a very nice English saying, “God
helps those who help themselves.”

45:52.293 --> 45:54.833
English language has so many beautiful
things in it,

45:55.034 --> 45:57.071
all its nursery rhymes and everything.

45:57.272 --> 46:01.706
I wish people would not just utter those
sayings but do it.

46:01.907 --> 46:03.669
They listen to me but they don’t do it.

46:03.870 --> 46:06.433
Now you have heard me today,

46:06.634 --> 46:09.249
you should see how much responsible you
are.

46:09.450 --> 46:13.392
Now we had our first ashram and if there
are others,

46:13.592 --> 46:17.574
please excuse me, because it’s an open
thing and we have to talk about it.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.806
And I was surprised that in our first
ashram, when I went there,

46:21.024 --> 46:27.775
I was amazed! I mean, young people living
like pigs!

46:27.982 --> 46:30.164
I couldn’t understand. I mean, they are
not hippies,

46:30.365 --> 46:33.837
they are not taking any smokes, drinks,
or anything.

46:34.038 --> 46:38.546
They are so irresponsible! They go
to the bathroom,

46:38.747 --> 46:43.393
they come out as if a bull in a china shop
has entered!

46:43.594 --> 46:46.136
And they really live like that, I was
amazed! How could they?

46:46.337 --> 46:49.716
And they were all graduates, MADs, PhDs,
and everything.

46:49.917 --> 46:53.211
I was wondering, “What has happened
to these people?”

46:53.412 --> 46:56.056
Slowly, slowly they improved. But this lot
went away

46:56.257 --> 46:59.008
then a new lot came in and a new lot
came in.

46:59.209 --> 47:04.726
And it’s so surprising that once they
become responsible and good,

47:04.927 --> 47:09.056
somehow or other Hanumana takes them out,

47:10.363 --> 47:12.232
and they just get out of it.

47:12.433 --> 47:16.484
Now, I have to tell you to determine today,
to decide,

47:16.685 --> 47:20.821
that every moment and movement of your life

47:21.022 --> 47:25.135
you are going to feel responsible as
Hanumana does.

47:25.336 --> 47:30.403
Any work you tell Him: about Him it is said
that,

47:30.604 --> 47:34.557
“Har kaarje karne ko, tat par.”

47:34.758 --> 47:40.009
Means for doing any work, he is just ready!
He’s just ready!

47:40.210 --> 47:44.284
You tell him anything, he’s just ready
to do it.

47:45.578 --> 47:48.900
It is his quality that you should have.

47:49.101 --> 47:52.578
And that quality is so much lacking today
in England.

47:52.779 --> 47:57.339
All your strikes, all your problems can
be solved.

47:57.540 --> 48:00.062
First time when I came, I was surprised,
I asked somebody,

48:00.263 --> 48:06.068
“Are you working?” He said, “No, I am
successfully unemployed!”

48:06.465 --> 48:11.431
I said, “Really? You are successfully
unemployed so how do you eat?”

48:11.632 --> 48:16.435
“Oh, we get our doles.” “Oh really?”
“We have securities.”

48:16.636 --> 48:21.391
What a security, it is nonsense, you are
parasite!

48:21.592 --> 48:25.112
There is no self-respect. Leave alone
the respect of others,

48:25.313 --> 48:30.408
there’s no self-respect. I was amazed!

48:30.609 --> 48:32.663
Then I told them, “All of you have to take
to work.

48:32.864 --> 48:38.920
Anybody who takes to doles is not going
to stay in the ashram.”

48:39.121 --> 48:42.760
I wish your government can take some note
of it!

48:42.961 --> 48:46.158
That we have to create responsible
citizens.

48:46.359 --> 48:50.959
In England itself, we have to show that by
Sahaj Yoga you have turned the tables,

48:51.159 --> 48:57.434
you have got smart people now, efficient,
responsible.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.935
This is what we have to show. Once you
show this to others,

49:01.136 --> 49:04.519
people will be amazed at it!

49:05.059 --> 49:07.298
With other’s money [it’s] the same thing.

49:07.499 --> 49:11.739
If you can get hold of somebody else’s
money that’s the best thing!

49:11.940 --> 49:14.418
It’s a very common feature.

49:14.619 --> 49:19.241
First time the Sahaja Yogis went to India
they came back here,

49:19.442 --> 49:24.237
they never wrote a letter back, thanking
them. And I was amazed.

49:24.438 --> 49:26.249
For six months, I said, “What are you
doing?”

49:26.450 --> 49:28.544
“I know we should have written. I know
we should have written.”

49:28.745 --> 49:32.186
“Then why? Why didn’t you write?”

49:32.918 --> 49:38.041
No responsibility! What is this, I could
not understand.

49:38.242 --> 49:42.957
Gradually they developed and developed
and developed. Now they feel.

49:43.158 --> 49:47.177
But those who have started feeling are
the matured Sahaja Yogis I should say.

49:47.378 --> 49:49.543
But others who are coming to it must know

49:49.744 --> 49:52.342
that you have to have a sense
of responsibility.

49:52.543 --> 49:55.294
Sometimes people who are realised have
a feeling,

49:55.495 --> 49:58.337
“Oh, now we are realised! Now, nothing!

49:58.538 --> 50:03.470
Settle down, have the bliss of Mother.
Sit down and enjoy it,”

50:03.671 --> 50:06.267
Nothing doing! It will stop!

50:06.468 --> 50:10.660
You have to be able to give this to others,
you should emit.

50:10.861 --> 50:15.331
If you cannot emit those vibrations
yourself…

50:15.532 --> 50:18.736
If you are enlightened, you should be able
to give light to others.

50:18.937 --> 50:24.050
You can raise the Kundalini, all right, but
what about your own personality

50:24.256 --> 50:30.397
which is so irresponsible? Which is nowhere
near Hanumana’s.

50:30.598 --> 50:38.866
This Hanumana style of complete obedience
to your being,

50:39.067 --> 50:43.877
the complete emission of that love that
you have received,

50:44.078 --> 50:46.011
that Divine Power you have received.

50:46.212 --> 50:49.408
Unless and until you achieve that state

50:49.609 --> 50:53.478
you should not be satisfied with your
Self-realisation.

50:53.679 --> 51:03.352
Self-realisation is only complete when you
yourself become the giver of light.

51:03.553 --> 51:09.143
You the guru, you the great stars: that’s
my ambition.

51:09.344 --> 51:15.315
I know I expect [a lot] sometimes from
my children.

51:15.516 --> 51:25.476
And I want them to understand that I want
you to be really honoured

51:25.677 --> 51:29.934
in the Kingdom of God as great sons
of your Mother.

51:30.135 --> 51:32.850
May God bless you.

51:33.932 --> 51:40.118
Left Side also, you know that, but keep
it up.

51:40.372 --> 51:44.238
I do correct, by saying all these things.

51:44.439 --> 51:49.559
I do awaken Hanumana and Shri Rama within
you, no doubt, I know that.

51:49.767 --> 51:55.905
But keep them awake, keep them alert.

51:56.106 --> 52:00.865
And you have to be alert and active,

52:01.596 --> 52:07.006
responsible and respectable.

52:07.809 --> 52:11.847
You have to realise that you are saints,

52:12.048 --> 52:14.889
saints of a very special quality.

52:15.090 --> 52:19.257
The saints who can give realisations
to others!

52:19.458 --> 52:22.592
There have been not such saints, many,
before,

52:22.793 --> 52:25.797
nor even today, there are saints who are
realised souls

52:25.997 --> 52:28.099
but they don’t know how to give
realisation.

52:28.300 --> 52:33.033
They don’t know so much. You have so much
of knowledge and everything,

52:33.234 --> 52:43.480
except the vehicle is poor, it cannot carry
the bliss.

52:43.681 --> 52:49.897
And the cup has to be all right otherwise
it cannot carry

52:50.098 --> 53:00.170
the beautiful fountain of love that is
pouring down on this Earth.

53:00.460 --> 53:05.118
And that is how you must know that, within
you this is awakened,

53:05.319 --> 53:09.707
keep it awakened, keep it going.

53:12.215 --> 53:18.237
Please close your eyes, [feet] straight
on the ground.

53:18.438 --> 53:22.383
Put both the hands towards me like that.

53:23.843 --> 53:25.474
Thoughts are gone now, there are no
thoughts.

53:25.674 --> 53:29.893
So even if you want to feel guilty you
cannot.

53:30.102 --> 53:32.689
There’s nothing to feel guilty. It is to
awaken

53:32.890 --> 53:38.043
within yourself, that fire of Spirit,

53:38.352 --> 53:47.131
that makes you express and emit.

53:51.340 --> 53:55.578
We have to move very fast. We have
to achieve it very fast.

53:55.779 --> 53:59.757
There isn’t much time left for us.

53:59.958 --> 54:03.003
It’s easy to say that, “It’s rather
difficult,” and all that.

54:03.204 --> 54:06.612
These things are not to be talked by us.

54:06.813 --> 54:10.207
This is meant for some dramas and things.

54:10.408 --> 54:14.650
It’s not for people who are chosen by God.

54:21.340 --> 54:26.015
Just lift your hands a little bit and
you’ll feel it in the hands.

54:29.503 --> 54:34.783
Better now? Right side opening very much!

54:36.554 --> 54:38.637
Not to have any fright, nothing.

54:38.838 --> 54:41.752
You know your Mother can never be angry
with you, never.

54:41.953 --> 54:46.718
But I have to awaken them. That I love
you very much,

54:46.919 --> 54:50.921
that I want you to have your due:

54:51.374 --> 54:58.120
all the heralds and all the glory.

55:00.764 --> 55:05.680
Close your eyes now and let it go, let it
flow.

55:06.403 --> 55:09.330
See the responsibility of the Spirit is
so great.

55:09.531 --> 55:11.984
Whatever may be your vehicle, once it is
awakened

55:12.185 --> 55:15.774
it gives Realisation to others, it acts.

55:15.975 --> 55:20.634
Be responsible like that Spirit.

55:22.015 --> 55:28.495
If you become the Spirit you will be like
that Spirit.

55:36.527 --> 55:42.098
Close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

55:44.551 --> 55:49.215
By rising your Right Side only you can
really give balance to your Left Side:

55:49.416 --> 55:53.087
otherwise there is no way out.

55:56.333 --> 56:01.692
You just try to be responsible, you will be
amazed.

56:02.228 --> 56:07.372
You just try to be responsible and you will
be amazed,

56:07.572 --> 56:13.158
your all financial problems, all your
problems, will be solved,

56:13.359 --> 56:16.493
because you are awakened!

56:17.755 --> 56:19.934
And you have a special power.

56:20.135 --> 56:23.483
You have to be just this power!

56:23.692 --> 56:31.286
The responsibility becomes a heavenly power
within you.

56:34.699 --> 56:37.182
Get the power from your heart.

56:37.383 --> 56:40.868
Put your heart into it. Put your heart.

56:41.069 --> 56:45.634
Put all these things into your heart:
“I have to do it from my heart!

56:45.835 --> 56:49.949
I have to be responsible from my heart.

56:52.036 --> 56:55.984
I have to be innately responsible.”
