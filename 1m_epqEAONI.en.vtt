00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.834
It is very nice to see you all again here.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.834
I think, this is the first puja we are having in this place

00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:11.667
and I hope, you are all comfortable

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:16.625
and it was convenient for you to come here.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.333
Today is really a very great day.

00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:31.959
It is to celebrate Adi Shakti.

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:35.208
What is the origin of this Adi Shakti?

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.000
I have never talked about it.

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:43.208
This is the first time I tell you

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:53.000
that Adi Shakti is the Primordial Mother

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.000
is the Power

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.417
Power of God, that wanted to create this world

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:19.417
and She Herself managed to create this great world.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:23.417
Can't you all sit down?

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:29.083
There is no space for them or what?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.500
Please be seated.

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:39.000
Why are they standing?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.333
(Hindi)

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:58.000
There are chairs behind you.

00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:02.917
It's alright, you can sit on chairs.

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:18.000
This is all falling down.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.083
As far as possible be comfortable.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.750
Don't strain yourself unnecessarily.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:57.291
I hope you all find some place to be seated comfortably.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.834
So, today I am going to tell you about Adi Shakti,

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:14.834
which is a very, very ancient subject.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.208
Adi Shakti is the Power of God Himself

00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:31.999
and She created this world

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:38.834
to bring His Kingdom on this earth.

00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:47.000
You can imagine, there was nothing but darkness,

00:11:47.917 --> 00:12:07.000
and out of this darkness She had to create all these beautiful, picturesque trees

00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:11.999
and all kinds of vegetation.

00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:15.333
That She did create.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
But what is the use in having all these things,

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:30.000
which do not speak, do not understand,

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:35.083
there is no manifestation with them.

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:56.625
Of course, some of the trees and some of the flowers do receive beautiful vibrations

00:12:57.083 --> 00:13:01.417
and they grow very well.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.917
But not all, some of them.

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:19.625
For example, I must tell you that here, flowers have no fragrance.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.999
All the flowers, they have no fragrance.

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:38.000
I have been going around to see, if there were flowers of fragrance.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:45.000
But what they do is to grow them big,

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:51.500
they are very big, much bigger than you can find them anywhere.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:55.834
But there is no fragrance.

00:13:57.083 --> 00:14:04.999
While in a poor country like India, the flowers have tremendous fragrance

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.125
even small flowers have tremendous fragrance.

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:24.500
Now what is the speciality of the fragrance in India and nowhere else? Nowhere!

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:30.083
Some flowers maybe have a little fragrance.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
But there is no fragrance in the flowers

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:46.875
that are grown so very beautifully, full of love and care.

00:14:48.834 --> 00:14:55.000
But lots of wild flowers also in India have got fragance.

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:59.999
What is the reason?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.999
They say that the soil of India has fragrance.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.917
How can you have fragrance in the soil?

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:16.000
But it is a fact.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.083
What I am saying is not just a story but a fact,

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:30.208
that in India any flower that you grow mostly has fragrance,

00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:37.625
while here that is not the case.

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.917
Neither it is in any other country.

00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:48.750
You go to Norway, or you go to Germany, any other country you go,

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:56.000
you won't find any fragrance in the flowers.

00:15:57.208 --> 00:16:06.834
It is very shocking, why there is no fragrance in flowers.

00:16:15.834 --> 00:16:24.999
When this world was created there was no fragrance.

00:16:26.417 --> 00:16:30.208
But in some areas there was.

00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:44.917
Especially in areas which we call India and otherwise.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:56.333
It is unbelievable that here or anywhere abroad

00:16:57.125 --> 00:17:00.208
there are no flowers with fragrance.

00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:13.625
So now you are born here, you have brought the fragrance.

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:18.208
You are the people who are realised souls

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.125
and you have got the fragrance to spread,

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:26.417
so your responsibility doubles I think,

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:32.458
that you must spread fragrance.

00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:37.834
Fragrance is something very innate.

00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:44.999
Even on this soil, which we should say, is without fragrance,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:52.417
the people have fragrance in their character,

00:17:52.834 --> 00:17:56.083
in their behaviour, in their understanding.

00:17:57.417 --> 00:18:02.000
And there is peace, which they are aspiring.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:08.500
I don't say, they are peaceful, but they are aspiring to have peace.

00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:13.500
This aspiration only suggests they are fragrant people,

00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:17.417
that they are very fragrant.

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:24.750
The fragrance in a human being is his nature, his temperament,

00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:33.500
how he is and how he behaves towards others.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:43.417
All the countries all over, still are not aware

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.625
that you have to become fragrant.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:56.999
If they were to be aware, then all wars will end.

00:18:57.083 --> 00:19:01.999
Everything will finish off and they will know: we are all one.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.999
We do not belong to different countries or anything, which we have made.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.417
God has not made it. We have made it.

00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:18.417
This is your country, this is their country - and countrywise we fight.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
This country belongs to no one. This belongs to God.

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:32.917
But people stupidly fight on the countries:

00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:36.083
that this our country, this is our country.

00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:40.333
Now, I have travelled all over the world,

00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:46.000
I would not say any, any country as their own.

00:19:46.917 --> 00:19:55.500
Because, if you own a country, you should have fragrance.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:05.000
You should have temperament, which will make other people feel

00:20:05.834 --> 00:20:10.000
that you come from countries of fragrance.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You don't have to argue.

00:20:13.417 --> 00:20:20.750
But one country fighting with another country, everywhere it goes on.

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:23.208
You read it in the newspaper,

00:20:23.834 --> 00:20:29.208
all the time you see this nonsense, that countries are fighting.

00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:34.208
And the more they are developed,the better they are

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:39.208
In this development of theirs, I hope they rise

00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:46.083
and become spiritual and develop fragrance.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
But this fighting spirit of human beings has come from Satan, I think.

00:20:56.417 --> 00:21:03.625
That they are killing themselves, killing others, destroying the whole world.

00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:07.583
You read newspaper, you feel so ashamed,

00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:10.792
how human beings are going on.

00:21:11.917 --> 00:21:17.000
So, all the Sahaja Yogis should not support any kind of fight.

00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:26.500
They are here to bring fragrance to people,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.417
to bring happiness, and joy, and not to fight.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.625
That is one of the first duties of Sahaja yogis,

00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:43.750
not to join anything which hates, which fights, which creates problems.

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:50.000
These fighting spirits have destroyed the fragrance of the soil.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.000
If people become loving and affectionate,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.208
this soil itself will become fragrant.

00:22:09.083 --> 00:22:13.834
First thing we must learn is to love each other

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:18.000
and not to hate anyone.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.999
There are so many ways of hating, this is also a human quality.

00:22:25.208 --> 00:22:29.750
Animals do hate, because they are animals.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.500
Human beings can't be animals.

00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:45.625
We are human beings and as human beings what we should have is love, affection,

00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:49.417
and no hatred of any kind.

00:22:49.834 --> 00:22:52.000
Now, as you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:22:52.625 --> 00:23:00.083
I would say that you should try to develop your loving capacity,

00:23:00.917 --> 00:23:06.625
instead of fighting capacity or criticising others.

00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:12.959
Very easy to criticise, but try to understand,

00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:16.333
that our soil itself has no fragrance.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.417
How are we to bring fragrance to this soil?

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:30.000
This is only, if people live here, have affection and love for each other.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.000
This is the most important thing.

00:23:34.208 --> 00:23:41.083
When creation took place it was only through affection.

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:47.083
Otherwise what was the need for nature to create all these things?

00:23:47.417 --> 00:23:49.750
All this is for what?

00:23:49.834 --> 00:23:52.083
To make you feel beautiful.

00:23:52.625 --> 00:24:00.000
All these trees are beautiful to make you feel good,

00:24:00.417 --> 00:24:04.208
to feel one with the nature.

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:12.500
In that way, human beings have not contributed.

00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:15.417
No, I am not saying Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:15.834 --> 00:24:19.458
They are rare and they are wonderful

00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:26.250
and they have done a good job, because they consider love as the highest.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:36.000
But you have to show to others also, that you want to love them

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:39.834
because they should love each other.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.417
The whole world is created because there was love.

00:24:45.834 --> 00:24:51.083
Otherwise, what was the need to waste energy on these continents

00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:53.917
and all these different countries?

00:24:55.208 --> 00:25:00.875
It was not to fight, was not to hate each other

00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:04.500
or to think of no end of yourself,

00:25:04.917 --> 00:25:10.000
but to love each other and to have more brothers and sisters.

00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:16.000
As in Sahaja Yoga you feel that way, you have brothers and sisters all over.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.917
Today, when I was coming,

00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:25.750
I was so happy to see, there were people from all over Europe

00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:27.999
and also from India.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
How is it possible?

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:35.625
Because you have developed that love.

00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:40.500
Because you have that innate love.

00:25:41.417 --> 00:25:47.417
So, where ever you go, where ever you meet people, they should say:

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.999
"We have seen Sahaja Yogis, who are nothing but love."

00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:57.208
They are not bothered as to what you are

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.834
what your position is or anything,

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:03.834
they only know that you are a Sahaja Yogi

00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:07.000
and a Sahaja Yogi loves other Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.500
This is a very big achievement,

00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:15.417
it was never there, as there is no fragrance in the soil,

00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:18.917
no fragrance in the human beings.

00:26:20.917 --> 00:26:23.417
Now that has come.

00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:28.208
Now you have got the capacity to love each other

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.834
and to help each other and to understand each other,

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:42.000
not to criticise and not to insult or in any way defame them.

00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:49.417
This I am saying, because you are all rare people who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:49.834 --> 00:26:53.000
How many people are Sahaja Yogis?

00:26:53.208 --> 00:26:57.583
You see: very few.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.417
We have to have more Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:07.000
That they understand that we are all part and parcel of one country,

00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:10.625
and that country is of love.

00:27:11.208 --> 00:27:16.625
This, when it happens, then we will say that Sahaja Yoga has worked out.

00:27:16.999 --> 00:27:23.000
Helping each other, understanding each other, that should be there.

00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:26.500
And I think, Sahaja Yogis do understand each other

00:27:26.834 --> 00:27:29.000
and they love each other.

00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:34.500
But still it should go more than their limits.

00:27:35.834 --> 00:27:41.625
Many people don't understand, that Sahaja Yoga is not for them only,

00:27:41.917 --> 00:27:43.999
it is for the whole world.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.333
You have to give it to others

00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:53.917
and you have to bring forth what you call Unity of Love.

00:27:54.917 --> 00:27:58.999
In love you don't see wrong things.

00:28:01.417 --> 00:28:04.500
We just enjoy love,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.834
and that is what is to be seen in today's Puja, is that:

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:18.083
Do we bear any hatred for anyone?

00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:25.208
Do we have ill feeling for anyone or for any country?

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:30.291
You should try to examine yourself.

00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:38.417
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, you will hit no one,

00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:45.208
but you love, and love as your own.

00:28:45.834 --> 00:28:50.500
Love is the biggest thing that God has given to human beings

00:28:50.917 --> 00:28:57.208
and that is what one has to try to develop.

00:28:58.417 --> 00:29:00.625
I'm so happy here,

00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:09.500
now you have come all the way to celebrate this first day.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.083
First day of your growth as Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:30.500
Now, if the Sahaja Yogis spread out and become Sahaja Yogis

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.083
then your job is finished.

00:29:35.917 --> 00:29:40.917
Because then you are enjoying the joy of oneness.

00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:47.750
So, one has to do it in a way that we all become one.

00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:53.417
There is nothing to criticise or to hate anyone,

00:29:53.834 --> 00:29:57.999
but to love each other, that is the point.

00:29:58.083 --> 00:30:07.417
And there I find there are so many Sahaja Yogis, who have achieved that loving level.

00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:13.208
And there are some still who are struggling,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.999
they have not come up to that level.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.999
Some, not many.

00:30:21.083 --> 00:30:24.999
Sahaja Yoga means, we are one.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.834
We are all Sahaja Yogis, but not separately together.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
If one understands this fact,

00:30:37.417 --> 00:30:42.999
you have celebrated today's great day of Adi Shakti.

00:30:43.417 --> 00:30:46.917
Why did Adi Shakti create this world?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.625
Why did all this happen?

00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:53.083
Why don't we think:

00:30:53.417 --> 00:31:05.083
Why has so much of love, so much of prosperity been given to us?

00:31:05.834 --> 00:31:11.417
We never realise, where are we and how much we have got.

00:31:11.834 --> 00:31:15.000
It's not the money but the love.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:19.999
And when you will understand, we really love each other

00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:26.333
and there is no hatred, there is no revenge, nothing,

00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:30.083
but just love and love and love.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.000
This is what is the message of today.

00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:39.500
We all have to be loving each other.

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:47.000
We have to have all kinds of rituals,

00:31:47.208 --> 00:31:53.000
but it is only the expression of our love!

00:31:53.208 --> 00:31:59.999
It's not just a ritual. It is love!

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:05.917
When you have love of the Mother, how do you express?

00:32:06.834 --> 00:32:09.917
In the same way we have to know

00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:16.750
that today we have to promise that for us love is the most important.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.417
We should love.

00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:23.500
People don't even love in their own families.

00:32:24.917 --> 00:32:27.999
I am not talking to such people, I know.

00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:35.750
They love their own families, their own village, their surroundings, everywhere.

00:32:35.834 --> 00:32:41.999
But still the world is going on with wars, fighting and all kinds of troubles.

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:49.500
The whole world has to come up to love each other.

00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:54.834
There is no other solution but to love.

00:32:55.083 --> 00:32:59.875
And in that love there is no selfishness, but enjoyment

00:32:59.999 --> 00:33:08.999
and that enjoyment you should feel and give it to others.

00:33:09.083 --> 00:33:13.417
I am sure, you all Sahaja Yogis are doing that,

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:18.208
and you are seeing the mistakes of the others

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.625
and not to get anybody into trouble.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:32.417
Love is the message of Adi Shakti.

00:33:32.917 --> 00:33:39.000
Now, you think about it, one Adi Shakti created the whole world.

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:42.458
How She must have done it?

00:33:42.834 --> 00:33:45.834
What She must have planned?

00:33:47.417 --> 00:33:52.417
How She must have organised it? It is not an easy thing.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.999
Only because She loved.

00:33:56.417 --> 00:34:00.999
Her love is the expression that you are all there.

00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:07.500
And that is why, to be one with Her, one should learn to love.

00:34:07.834 --> 00:34:14.000
Of course, in that you have to know, that you should forgive.

00:34:14.625 --> 00:34:16.333
If you don't know how to forgive

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:22.417
and find mistakes of other people, you won't help.

00:34:22.917 --> 00:34:28.625
What is your now job is, to see that you are loving.

00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:31.417
That there is no hatred for anyone.

00:34:32.083 --> 00:34:36.917
You don't think of hating someone, or hitting somebody.

00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:39.000
This has to work out.

00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:43.417
I am sure, this will work out.

00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:53.417
In all the European countries and the Indian continent:

00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:59.999
Those who are developed are fighting.

00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:04.333
Those who are not developed are fighting.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.333
They have their own style of fighting.

00:35:07.834 --> 00:35:09.999
That is the only difference.

00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:12.625
But there is no love.

00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:19.000
If you want to have love, then you feel sorry.

00:35:20.917 --> 00:35:25.417
Supposing, I see some country, X-country.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:31.917
Then it is very easy for me to criticise that this country is very bad,

00:35:32.417 --> 00:35:35.625
that people are bad, this is bad, that is.

00:35:36.625 --> 00:35:43.625
But I think, potentially they are all fine, very good people.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.750
Somehow or other I should be able to make them understand that.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.208
If they understand, what is love and enjoy love,

00:35:57.834 --> 00:36:00.999
there will be no problems of any kind.

00:36:01.417 --> 00:36:04.999
Only human beings know how to love,

00:36:05.208 --> 00:36:07.333
nobody else!

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.750
Animals also love, but their love is so limited.

00:36:12.333 --> 00:36:17.208
But human beings, their love is so beautiful.

00:36:17.834 --> 00:36:21.500
They look beautiful only when they love.

00:36:21.834 --> 00:36:25.417
So, I have to tell you not to make cheap love

00:36:25.834 --> 00:36:30.417
but a love that you will enjoy

00:36:30.917 --> 00:36:34.000
and that another person will also enjoy.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.834
It's something to be understood,

00:36:37.917 --> 00:36:43.208
the way people understand love is sometimes very ridiculous.

00:36:45.208 --> 00:36:49.417
So, one has to first understand, what is love,

00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:56.000
also to understand, whether you love or not.

00:36:57.333 --> 00:36:59.625
You really love the world,

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:04.000
if you really love this creation of God,

00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:08.625
then there should be no hatred,

00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:11.208
there should be no fights,

00:37:12.625 --> 00:37:15.291
but just to see the good points.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.500
As a mother would see her child,

00:37:19.208 --> 00:37:28.208
you should see the whole world as a beautiful piece that God has created for you.

00:37:28.417 --> 00:37:33.333
This subject is so lengthy that I can talk to you for hours.

00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:36.375
But I have to just say that,

00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:41.917
if you can understand, a little bit of it, it is this

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:46.417
we all should have love for each other.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.750
And we should have understanding.

00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:55.000
Look at the small children, they love each other.

00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:59.417
They haven't learned yet, how to hate.

00:38:01.083 --> 00:38:07.500
But if the children are not brought up well, they can hate each other.

00:38:10.417 --> 00:38:14.999
They can be very ridiculously funny

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.208
So many countries today are like that.

00:38:19.417 --> 00:38:25.208
They are just fighting because they do not love.

00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:31.083
Now, also Sahaja Yogis have a much greater job,

00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:34.999
much greater life.

00:38:35.083 --> 00:38:40.999
They have to show that love is a very great thing.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:50.208
It doesn't matter, whether you are Hindu, Christian, this, that nonsense.

00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:54.999
You are all human beings

00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:58.083
and we have a right to love.

00:38:58.625 --> 00:39:04.999
And if you manage somehow to love people,

00:39:05.417 --> 00:39:09.999
I tell you, Sahaja Yoga will settle down.

00:39:10.417 --> 00:39:20.000
Sahaja Yoga is like a tree, which requires love as the water.

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:26.583
Try this around your life

00:39:26.917 --> 00:39:31.999
and you will find, how love pays itself.

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:38.999
Not to be seen by how much you spend or what you do.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.834
It's not that you count all those things.

00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:50.208
It's just like an ocean floats everything around,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.500
you become like that, a typical personality of Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.417
So, all the Sahaja Yogis must decide today,

00:40:00.917 --> 00:40:05.917
that we are going to forgive all the people we hate.

00:40:06.417 --> 00:40:08.999
And we are going to love all of them.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.208
Let us see, if it works out.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.333
I am sure, it will work out,

00:40:14.834 --> 00:40:17.125
because first of all you are all realised souls,

00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:24.999
and secondly, love is the biggest  boon on human beings.

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:31.625
Which, if you utilise, there will be no problem of any kind.

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:39.999
So thank you very much.
