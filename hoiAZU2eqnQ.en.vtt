00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.656
Now, this left Vishuddhi comes to you

00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:13.017
if you have said mantras wrongly.

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:16.957
You see, the mantras are to be said only when there is

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:21.878
a realised soul who knows what mantras are to be said.

00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:26.777
And if you do not know

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:31.762
about it, you accept the mantras.

00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:34.903
Anybody who tells you, "Say this mantra", you just start saying it,

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:40.456
without understanding, whether it is given by an authority or not.

00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:44.896
Also you don't know whether it is meant for you or not.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.816
Maybe it is not required for some.

00:00:46.897 --> 00:00:49.496
Any particular mantra may not be required.

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:52.769
And some of the mantras are absolutely absurd things.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.336
So mantras also, it's a very big science.

00:00:56.417 --> 00:01:00.177
And just now I am feeling the left Vishuddhi.

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:04.337
Also one feels it, even if you have not taken mantras, if

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:06.177
you have been feeling guilty.

00:01:06.377 --> 00:01:10.697
Like, you see, if you are used to confessions and things like that,

00:01:10.897 --> 00:01:16.257
if you are used to a situation where you feel that

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:21.995
"I'm guilty for this". You know, the norms of today's modern life

00:01:22.217 --> 00:01:25.977
are so funny, that even for small thing you have to feel guilty.

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:29.257
For example if you put the fork in a wrong way,

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:32.097
you feel guilty: "Oh God, I should not have done this."

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:34.177
Like that, the life is so complicated,

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:37.457
but very, very small things can also make you feel guilty.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:42.297
So if you are feeling guilty also you feel this centre very much.

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:48.377
Now, this centre is very important, because

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:54.137
if this centre is not all right, then Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:56.657
She pulls

00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:00.577
this, at this point. Half of it is pulled out.

00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:04.897
And there is a blockage. And so Kundalini does not rise.

00:02:05.137 --> 00:02:09.097
Now, one should not feel guilty about anything, whatsoever!

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:12.737
There is nothing to feel guilty or to going for confessions

00:02:12.937 --> 00:02:15.377
and all the time saying, "I am such a sinner"

00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:19.097
and I should not have done this and I should not have done that.

00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:24.417
Because, as I told you yesterday, God is the ocean of love,

00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:30.657
He is the ocean of compassion and He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:35.137
So we should not unnecessarily condemn ourselves.

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:38.617
Moreover you are the temple of God.

00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:40.697
And if you condemn yourself like that,

00:02:40.897 --> 00:02:44.617
that "I'm good for nothing, I am useless",

00:02:44.817 --> 00:02:49.377
then you are condemning that temple which is created by God.

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:51.457
You have not created yourself.

00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:53.937
So you have no right to condemn yourself.

00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:56.737
Now little mistakes if you have done doesn't matter.

00:02:56.937 --> 00:02:58.777
Because I am talking of the ocean.

00:02:58.977 --> 00:03:03.337
So little mistakes here and there can always be corrected.

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.208
So one should not feel guilty.

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.129
Now see, are you feeling the vibrations now? Let's see.
