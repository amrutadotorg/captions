00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:45.039
Later on, after the puja, you have to turn
the camera

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.583
in such a way that you get most of them.
Later on.

00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:06.435
Today we are celebrating here a special
day called Makar Sankrant.

00:09:06.636 --> 00:09:14.150
For the information of the foreign Sahaja
Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.

00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:19.375
[Shri Mataji explains that She will speak
first in English then in Marathi].

00:09:20.337 --> 00:09:25.132
It means the day - today is the day the sun

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:37.126
crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.842
It’s a very big day for us because, now

00:09:45.024 --> 00:09:51.285
during the summer time we have the harvest,
and we look forward to the rain

00:09:51.486 --> 00:09:56.118
and so many things that happen in every
country.

00:09:56.319 --> 00:10:05.419
The sun falls at right angles in this
country during the summer season

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.924
and so we welcome the sun. We eat something

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:17.444
that you must have eaten already, what we
call as til and jaggery.

00:10:17.644 --> 00:10:21.722
It is to prepare your body and your mind

00:10:21.923 --> 00:10:25.512
to give it sufficient heat to receive
the sun.

00:10:25.713 --> 00:10:30.451
Because if you are living in the cold
season,

00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:38.610
then all your body, mind becomes lethargic

00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:46.682
and you become also sometimes very lazy
about things, in the sense

00:10:46.883 --> 00:10:54.408
that the day is so small that you cannot
achieve many results.

00:10:54.866 --> 00:11:03.206
So the body has become cold as we call it.
We take these things, which give us heat,

00:11:03.407 --> 00:11:08.148
so body is prepared to receive the heat
of the sun to welcome it.

00:11:08.349 --> 00:11:16.858
To overcome the inertia set in by the cold
weather,

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:25.016
and also to invigorate the body's strength,
tune to the sun,

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:31.958
people take to all these ways of greeting
you

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:38.077
by which they give you something that is
heat-creating in the body.

00:11:39.175 --> 00:11:44.846
But it has another very subtle expression,
which I find is this:

00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:48.976
that when they give you this, they say,
“Now you take til and gul

00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:53.894
and you say things which are sweet”.

00:11:54.387 --> 00:11:58.745
Because when you are taking til and gul,
your body gets heated up

00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:04.087
and you become right-sided person. When you
become right-sided person

00:12:04.288 --> 00:12:09.220
you seldom speak sweetly. So it is
a contrast

00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:13.641
that they give you a thing to heat you up
so that your body gets heated up

00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:18.159
but you must speak sweetly.

00:12:19.086 --> 00:12:22.304
So there is a warning that you are eating
all these things

00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:26.374
but that doesn't mean now you ride on a big
horse of ego

00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:29.923
and start slashing everyone.

00:12:30.123 --> 00:12:34.882
It's a very subtle thing to understand that
when we become

00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:41.276
temperamentally right-sided, we are so much
covered by our ego

00:12:41.477 --> 00:12:46.488
that we do not feel that we are hurting
others by what we say.

00:12:46.689 --> 00:12:50.446
If there are two egoistical people, they
can manage among themselves.

00:12:50.647 --> 00:12:54.781
But if there is one egoistical and another
one who is subdued,

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:58.128
then the subdued will be finished.

00:12:58.328 --> 00:13:03.117
That's why they say today is the day when
we start speaking very sweetly.

00:13:03.318 --> 00:13:07.185
Even if there is some enemy or somebody
who is not friendly with you,

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:11.720
or there has been some misunderstanding,
this is the day we say that,

00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:19.436
“All right, take this and say something
very sweet. Talk sweetly to each other”.

00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:23.647
But today only I think I received a letter
from a Sahaja Yogini,

00:13:23.848 --> 00:13:29.637
which was so full of harshness that I was
surprised that I should receive it today.

00:13:29.838 --> 00:13:32.724
Not to Me but some other Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:32.924 --> 00:13:36.555
So one thing today we have to decide and
take a vow

00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:42.280
that to another Sahaja Yogi we are not
going to speak harshly,

00:13:43.815 --> 00:13:48.127
and talk to him in a way as if he is
an ordinary person.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:52.964
Now supposing he is a leader: then there is
more reason that you should respect.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:59.178
And if he is a senior leader, then there is
more reason that you must respect.

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:04.420
The first thing one has to learn that we
have to respect.

00:14:04.621 --> 00:14:09.657
Now the sun is so much respected in this
country that in early morning time

00:14:09.858 --> 00:14:15.941
all the people get up and say Namaskars
to Surya with all His names

00:14:16.142 --> 00:14:21.208
and do a particular type of exercise to show
that they are completely surrendered

00:14:21.409 --> 00:14:29.509
to the will of the Surya. When you do that,
then the ego doesn't come in.

00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:35.707
Now the sun, when He shines here, it gives
you a feeling

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:40.236
that you have to be active, you have
to work very hard.

00:14:40.437 --> 00:14:44.342
As a result of that, you might develop ego.

00:14:44.543 --> 00:14:50.674
But when you develop ego, then it surrounds
your brain completely,

00:14:50.875 --> 00:14:54.676
and when the brain is surrounded with ego,
you do not know

00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:59.899
which way to go. You do not know what is
right, what is wrong.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.063
You do not have any discretion and no
direction.

00:15:04.264 --> 00:15:08.050
You do what you please, whatever pleases
ego.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:13.593
And this is a day when we celebrate it in
a way to surrender ourselves to the Surya,

00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:21.891
to the sun which is, as you know, is
the residence of Shri Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:22.092 --> 00:15:30.471
He resides on the sun. So how humble He
was, how humble He was residing on the sun.

00:15:30.672 --> 00:15:35.802
The more you live on the sun there should
be much more humility.

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:40.816
Of course, I must say in India people are
humbler. But still,

00:15:41.017 --> 00:15:48.825
the quality of sun can make you extremely
arrogant and very unpleasant person.

00:15:49.026 --> 00:15:54.701
This unpleasant person can really ruin
all kinds of good relations.

00:15:54.902 --> 00:16:01.274
But the worst thing that happens to us is
that we lose our integration.

00:16:01.475 --> 00:16:05.180
Because when we say harsh things to anyone,
we feel guilty

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.164
so we have another problem, our heart feels
bad, our liver feels bad,

00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:15.495
everything is upset. And thus we feel
absolutely disintegrated.

00:16:15.696 --> 00:16:22.565
And disintegrated is a sign of our not
evolving at all

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:26.776
or we should say devolving.

00:16:27.694 --> 00:16:32.680
Disintegration is such a common thing that
we see -

00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:40.625
in ourselves we see that we fight with
our ego.

00:16:40.826 --> 00:16:46.211
Then we fight with our superego, then we
fight with our heart,

00:16:46.412 --> 00:16:52.082
with our emotions, and all the time we are
fighting within ourselves.

00:16:52.283 --> 00:16:57.381
So at least within ourselves we should
speak sweetly on this day.

00:16:57.582 --> 00:17:02.147
Then we can start speaking to others very,
very sweetly.

00:17:02.348 --> 00:17:08.052
Now some people think, to speak sweetly is
a sign of weakness.

00:17:08.253 --> 00:17:12.522
In some countries people believe that if
you speak to someone sweetly

00:17:12.723 --> 00:17:18.007
is a sign of weakness. It is the greatest
strength of a Sahaja Yogi

00:17:18.207 --> 00:17:27.238
to speak to others with respect, with proper
protocol, and with proper understanding.

00:17:28.432 --> 00:17:31.846
Now because of arrogance, people also
forget

00:17:32.047 --> 00:17:41.220
what is their situation is, and this
indiscreet temperament

00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:46.536
gives you no sense of direction. You move
in every direction and you don't know

00:17:46.737 --> 00:17:50.579
where you are going. As long as your ego
is satisfied,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.161
you go ahead with it, and by the time you
discover that you have really become

00:17:55.362 --> 00:18:01.129
a humpty-dumpty, you do not know what you
have done to yourself.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.411
So the best way to conquer your ego is

00:18:04.612 --> 00:18:10.226
to speak sweetly first of all. It’s such
a small thing to be done

00:18:10.427 --> 00:18:18.682
but it brings you to that synthesis
of character within yourself first of all,

00:18:18.883 --> 00:18:25.300
and to the synthesis of all the beautiful
principles of lives.

00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:28.628
Like you talk to somebody sweetly,

00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:32.843
the person may like you. He may tell you
something,

00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:38.496
which he may be knowing of a very great
importance for you.

00:18:38.697 --> 00:18:46.465
If you talk to somebody sweetly, then you
may get the peace of mind

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:50.095
because you have given peace to another
person.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.528
Whatever you give to another person, that
you feel within yourself.

00:18:53.729 --> 00:18:57.674
But if you are quarreling with another
person actually it is the reflection

00:18:57.875 --> 00:19:00.836
of your quarrelling nature within yourself.

00:19:01.037 --> 00:19:05.403
Today there is a big dearth, and big cry
and big organizations

00:19:05.604 --> 00:19:11.944
working out the peace missions. The peace
mission is within yourself.

00:19:12.145 --> 00:19:16.607
Let us start all of us the Sahaja Yogis who
are great saints sitting here,

00:19:16.808 --> 00:19:21.159
decide today that we are going to make
peace with ourselves and with others.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.641
But first and foremost thing the peace
cannot be made with quarrels.

00:19:26.842 --> 00:19:30.139
You see, like America and Russia want
to decide it

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:36.438
with missiles, the peace part. They say,
“Let’s fight out.

00:19:36.639 --> 00:19:39.433
As many as will remain, then they can live
in peace.

00:19:39.634 --> 00:19:42.412
Let us all those who are fighting kill each
other”.

00:19:42.613 --> 00:19:46.702
They think this is the solution
of the problem. It's the other way around.

00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:52.917
Let everybody live peacefully within
themselves and give peace to others,

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:59.939
so that this peace will become a nucleus
for the peace of the world.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:10.483
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

00:20:10.684 --> 00:20:14.160
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:18.110
You are sitting in complete peace and
happiness and joy,

00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:23.036
you don't know, you are emitting all that
peace, channelizing it and doing it.

00:20:23.237 --> 00:20:30.746
But still there are some who are suffering
from horrible ego, and with hurt ego;

00:20:30.947 --> 00:20:37.134
and they are trying to do something, which
they should never do, is to think just now.

00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:41.246
If you are thinking just now, you will not
register what I am saying

00:20:41.447 --> 00:20:47.544
because this is another quality of a person
who is ego oriented is not to register.

00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:50.056
You may say anything you like but they
don't hear.

00:20:50.257 --> 00:20:53.351
They hear what they want to hear or they
don't hear.

00:20:53.551 --> 00:20:57.317
So this is another thing we have to today
decide,

00:20:57.518 --> 00:21:04.038
that we’ll register things than to tell
off. Let us register.

00:21:04.239 --> 00:21:11.332
This is a sign of a character that wants
to know; wants to know more about;

00:21:11.533 --> 00:21:17.958
the criteria of ascent is synthesis and
integration.

00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:25.950
A person who is not integrated with other
Sahaja Yogis is not a man who has ascended.

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:29.978
Who tries to divide and talk of divisions.

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:35.248
“We the English, We the Germans, We
the Indians,”

00:21:35.449 --> 00:21:39.568
then they are not Sahaja Yogis. They are
Indians all right, but not Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:44.343
Sahaja Yogis have no caste, creed or
nationality.

00:21:44.544 --> 00:21:49.580
We have to carry our passports only because
we are born in this jail.

00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:54.441
So we have to carry our criminal number!

00:21:56.447 --> 00:22:01.099
But actually you don't need it. You don't
need all those things.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.643
Now for us today to decide first of all
in our hearts

00:22:05.844 --> 00:22:08.727
that we’ll take to peaceful methods.

00:22:08.928 --> 00:22:12.755
When we are travelling, we’ll be taking
to peaceful methods.

00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:17.964
Anybody who is trying to provoke you or
trying to create a problem

00:22:18.165 --> 00:22:25.490
or divide you on any issue whatsoever, run
away from that person as fast as possible.

00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:32.330
Anybody who talks of peace, the peace-
makers, stick on to that person -

00:22:32.832 --> 00:22:38.332
then only you will understand that you are
also getting peace.

00:22:39.697 --> 00:22:45.639
Here you have come to get peace, not
to create problems,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.264
or to listen to your problems, but to get
to peace.

00:22:51.465 --> 00:23:00.710
Peace is a nature or is the quality of your
Spirit.

00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:06.032
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

00:23:06.233 --> 00:23:14.050
what happens that you go beyond the cause
and the effect.

00:23:14.251 --> 00:23:17.001
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

00:23:17.202 --> 00:23:22.041
So the cause disappears and the effect also
disappears.

00:23:22.242 --> 00:23:28.786
So today we all have come here to worship
the peace, the within and the without.

00:23:28.987 --> 00:23:33.819
Let us be peaceful people. Let us not join
groups who hate,

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.654
who talk big, who want to hate one person,
want to create a group,

00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:44.342
who says "we the Americans" or "we
the this", just.

00:23:44.543 --> 00:23:51.081
In Sahaja Yoga you must learn from people
who have advanced,

00:23:51.282 --> 00:23:56.664
who have very much progressed. For example
I would say among all the Europeans,

00:23:56.865 --> 00:24:02.309
Australians have done very well. There’s
nothing to feel jealous.

00:24:03.629 --> 00:24:07.915
All right, if Australians have done well,
alright that's your glory.

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:12.437
So ask them how they have done it, how
they have worked it out.

00:24:12.638 --> 00:24:20.855
Tomorrow may be that Americans - I wish
that very much - may do the best,

00:24:21.392 --> 00:24:26.227
so then you should ask them how have you
done so well.

00:24:26.428 --> 00:24:30.559
That's the way we’re going to live. We are
not going to compete,

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.103
we are not going to be jealous, but we are
going to absorb all that is best.

00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:38.191
This is Sahaja Yoga. Is the other way
around,

00:24:38.392 --> 00:24:41.674
like if they discover something -
a pilotless bomb -

00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:46.433
then they will discover something else
which is a machine-less bomb.

00:24:46.634 --> 00:24:52.706
No, it is another one. We develop a mind
which absorbs everything,

00:24:52.907 --> 00:24:57.707
and then we develop a bigger mind, which
gives everything.

00:24:57.908 --> 00:25:03.530
There is no secret in Sahaja Yoga. Everybody
who has known something better,

00:25:03.731 --> 00:25:07.797
has had some good experiences of Sahaja Yoga
should tell.

00:25:07.998 --> 00:25:10.977
But then in ego I have seen people start
preaching

00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:14.995
that, “All right, this method you try, that
method you try”.

00:25:15.196 --> 00:25:19.819
There is no need to do that also, because
of lack of discretion.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.464
If you had discretion you would have known
that this is not to be done.

00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:26.768
What is not to be done in Sahaja Yoga is
not to be done.

00:25:26.969 --> 00:25:31.940
But how will you know when you have no
discretion, like a lost ship.

00:25:32.141 --> 00:25:39.141
So then you have to see how your Mother
would act at such a position

00:25:39.633 --> 00:25:44.756
and then I’m sure you’ll go beyond the cause
and the effect.

00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:48.863
So today is the day I should also not say
anything

00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:53.709
that is in any way hurting to anyone

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:59.819
and I am trying to make you smile and laugh
but you are so serious.

00:26:01.696 --> 00:26:07.629
So today we decide on peace. Peace with
ourselves, peace with others

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:13.437
and that is how we worship the sun, Christ,
the One who was the emblem,

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:21.845
who was the absolute practical symbol
of that peace.

00:26:22.584 --> 00:26:30.002
And once you understand this, I am sure you
will try to follow that, instead of

00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:35.206
hitting everybody, getting angry with
everybody. Just forget all these things.

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:40.069
You have come here to ascend and your gain
is your gain.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.372
Your fighting is not your gain, remember
that.

00:26:43.573 --> 00:26:48.393
Your quarrelling is not your gain. The gain
is the peace that you have achieved,

00:26:48.594 --> 00:26:53.142
the love that you have developed,
the compassion that you can emit,

00:26:53.343 --> 00:26:57.911
the amount of relationship and the rapport
you can penetrate into others.

00:26:58.112 --> 00:27:01.796
This is your gain which we have to receive
today:

00:27:01.997 --> 00:27:08.376
a mind, a heart like a lion, and not
chicken-hearted people.

00:27:08.577 --> 00:27:14.294
Not people who would be angry and this,
to boast of your anger:

00:27:14.495 --> 00:27:19.428
these days are gone, we boast of our peace,
we boast of our contentment,

00:27:19.629 --> 00:27:26.251
we boast of our glory and we boast of our
state.

00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:31.189
And that is the state where we are now
in the Kingdom of God.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.460
May God bless you all!

00:27:35.433 --> 00:27:40.730
(Then Shri Mataji continues in Marathi
for about 12 minutes)

00:40:19.886 --> 00:40:26.088
The biggest problem is there – who is going
to now come for the puja.

00:40:27.274 --> 00:40:32.793
It’s easy to give a lecture, but to practice
it is very difficult.

00:40:45.938 --> 00:40:50.890
Those who have not yet worshipped Me
raise your hands.

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:09.257
Now, I would suggest one thing:

00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:14.670
that all those who have not worshipped
must give their namens to Warren.

00:41:14.871 --> 00:41:22.846
And at every puja we can have ten persons
from foreign

00:41:23.053 --> 00:41:30.621
and ten persons from the indians, alright?
And one person - he -

00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:34.230
or anybody who is supposed to be the priest,
the great, you see.

00:41:34.431 --> 00:41:40.421
So, we have twenty-one people. Now, any
ten pople, meaning persons,

00:41:40.622 --> 00:41:47.777
meaning ladies and gentlemen, ten from
the foreign countries without fighting

00:41:49.201 --> 00:41:56.358
and ten persons without fighting
from indians.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.237
Come along, come along.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.924
This is twenty second.

00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:17.070
Take out. Can you take this out?

00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:21.353
Hello? Can we somebody arrange this to be
taken away

00:43:21.554 --> 00:43:27.899
and put it for the pandits on that side?
Can you remove it?
