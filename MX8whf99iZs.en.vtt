WEBVTT

05:38.292 --> 05:45.039
Later on, after the puja, you have to turn
the camera

05:45.240 --> 05:50.583
in such a way that you get most of them.
Later on.

08:57.091 --> 09:06.435
Today we are celebrating here a special
day called Makar Sankrant.

09:06.636 --> 09:14.150
For the information of the foreign Sahaja
Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.

09:14.351 --> 09:19.375
[Shri Mataji explains that She will speak
first in English then in Marathi].

09:20.337 --> 09:25.132
It means the day - today is the day the sun

09:25.333 --> 09:37.126
crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

09:38.720 --> 09:44.842
It’s a very big day for us because, now

09:45.024 --> 09:51.285
during the summer time we have the harvest,
and we look forward to the rain

09:51.486 --> 09:56.118
and so many things that happen in every
country.

09:56.319 --> 10:05.419
The sun falls at right angles in this
country during the summer season

10:05.620 --> 10:10.924
and so we welcome the sun. We eat something

10:11.125 --> 10:17.444
that you must have eaten already, what we
call as til and jaggery.

10:17.644 --> 10:21.722
It is to prepare your body and your mind

10:21.923 --> 10:25.512
to give it sufficient heat to receive
the sun.

10:25.713 --> 10:30.451
Because if you are living in the cold
season,

10:30.652 --> 10:38.610
then all your body, mind becomes lethargic

10:38.811 --> 10:46.682
and you become also sometimes very lazy
about things, in the sense

10:46.883 --> 10:54.408
that the day is so small that you cannot
achieve many results.

10:54.866 --> 11:03.206
So the body has become cold as we call it.
We take these things, which give us heat,

11:03.407 --> 11:08.148
so body is prepared to receive the heat
of the sun to welcome it.

11:08.349 --> 11:16.858
To overcome the inertia set in by the cold
weather,

11:17.059 --> 11:25.016
and also to invigorate the body's strength,
tune to the sun,

11:25.217 --> 11:31.958
people take to all these ways of greeting
you

11:32.159 --> 11:38.077
by which they give you something that is
heat-creating in the body.

11:39.175 --> 11:44.846
But it has another very subtle expression,
which I find is this:

11:45.046 --> 11:48.976
that when they give you this, they say,
“Now you take til and gul

11:49.177 --> 11:53.894
and you say things which are sweet”.

11:54.387 --> 11:58.745
Because when you are taking til and gul,
your body gets heated up

11:58.946 --> 12:04.087
and you become right-sided person. When you
become right-sided person

12:04.288 --> 12:09.220
you seldom speak sweetly. So it is
a contrast

12:09.421 --> 12:13.641
that they give you a thing to heat you up
so that your body gets heated up

12:13.841 --> 12:18.159
but you must speak sweetly.

12:19.086 --> 12:22.304
So there is a warning that you are eating
all these things

12:22.505 --> 12:26.374
but that doesn't mean now you ride on a big
horse of ego

12:26.575 --> 12:29.923
and start slashing everyone.

12:30.123 --> 12:34.882
It's a very subtle thing to understand that
when we become

12:35.083 --> 12:41.276
temperamentally right-sided, we are so much
covered by our ego

12:41.477 --> 12:46.488
that we do not feel that we are hurting
others by what we say.

12:46.689 --> 12:50.446
If there are two egoistical people, they
can manage among themselves.

12:50.647 --> 12:54.781
But if there is one egoistical and another
one who is subdued,

12:54.982 --> 12:58.128
then the subdued will be finished.

12:58.328 --> 13:03.117
That's why they say today is the day when
we start speaking very sweetly.

13:03.318 --> 13:07.185
Even if there is some enemy or somebody
who is not friendly with you,

13:07.386 --> 13:11.720
or there has been some misunderstanding,
this is the day we say that,

13:11.921 --> 13:19.436
“All right, take this and say something
very sweet. Talk sweetly to each other”.

13:19.637 --> 13:23.647
But today only I think I received a letter
from a Sahaja Yogini,

13:23.848 --> 13:29.637
which was so full of harshness that I was
surprised that I should receive it today.

13:29.838 --> 13:32.724
Not to Me but some other Sahaja Yogi.

13:32.924 --> 13:36.555
So one thing today we have to decide and
take a vow

13:36.756 --> 13:42.280
that to another Sahaja Yogi we are not
going to speak harshly,

13:43.815 --> 13:48.127
and talk to him in a way as if he is
an ordinary person.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.964
Now supposing he is a leader: then there is
more reason that you should respect.

13:53.165 --> 13:59.178
And if he is a senior leader, then there is
more reason that you must respect.

13:59.379 --> 14:04.420
The first thing one has to learn that we
have to respect.

14:04.621 --> 14:09.657
Now the sun is so much respected in this
country that in early morning time

14:09.858 --> 14:15.941
all the people get up and say Namaskars
to Surya with all His names

14:16.142 --> 14:21.208
and do a particular type of exercise to show
that they are completely surrendered

14:21.409 --> 14:29.509
to the will of the Surya. When you do that,
then the ego doesn't come in.

14:30.546 --> 14:35.707
Now the sun, when He shines here, it gives
you a feeling

14:35.908 --> 14:40.236
that you have to be active, you have
to work very hard.

14:40.437 --> 14:44.342
As a result of that, you might develop ego.

14:44.543 --> 14:50.674
But when you develop ego, then it surrounds
your brain completely,

14:50.875 --> 14:54.676
and when the brain is surrounded with ego,
you do not know

14:54.877 --> 14:59.899
which way to go. You do not know what is
right, what is wrong.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.063
You do not have any discretion and no
direction.

15:04.264 --> 15:08.050
You do what you please, whatever pleases
ego.

15:08.250 --> 15:13.593
And this is a day when we celebrate it in
a way to surrender ourselves to the Surya,

15:13.794 --> 15:21.891
to the sun which is, as you know, is
the residence of Shri Lord Jesus Christ.

15:22.092 --> 15:30.471
He resides on the sun. So how humble He
was, how humble He was residing on the sun.

15:30.672 --> 15:35.802
The more you live on the sun there should
be much more humility.

15:36.003 --> 15:40.816
Of course, I must say in India people are
humbler. But still,

15:41.017 --> 15:48.825
the quality of sun can make you extremely
arrogant and very unpleasant person.

15:49.026 --> 15:54.701
This unpleasant person can really ruin
all kinds of good relations.

15:54.902 --> 16:01.274
But the worst thing that happens to us is
that we lose our integration.

16:01.475 --> 16:05.180
Because when we say harsh things to anyone,
we feel guilty

16:05.380 --> 16:10.164
so we have another problem, our heart feels
bad, our liver feels bad,

16:10.365 --> 16:15.495
everything is upset. And thus we feel
absolutely disintegrated.

16:15.696 --> 16:22.565
And disintegrated is a sign of our not
evolving at all

16:22.765 --> 16:26.776
or we should say devolving.

16:27.694 --> 16:32.680
Disintegration is such a common thing that
we see -

16:32.881 --> 16:40.625
in ourselves we see that we fight with
our ego.

16:40.826 --> 16:46.211
Then we fight with our superego, then we
fight with our heart,

16:46.412 --> 16:52.082
with our emotions, and all the time we are
fighting within ourselves.

16:52.283 --> 16:57.381
So at least within ourselves we should
speak sweetly on this day.

16:57.582 --> 17:02.147
Then we can start speaking to others very,
very sweetly.

17:02.348 --> 17:08.052
Now some people think, to speak sweetly is
a sign of weakness.

17:08.253 --> 17:12.522
In some countries people believe that if
you speak to someone sweetly

17:12.723 --> 17:18.007
is a sign of weakness. It is the greatest
strength of a Sahaja Yogi

17:18.207 --> 17:27.238
to speak to others with respect, with proper
protocol, and with proper understanding.

17:28.432 --> 17:31.846
Now because of arrogance, people also
forget

17:32.047 --> 17:41.220
what is their situation is, and this
indiscreet temperament

17:41.421 --> 17:46.536
gives you no sense of direction. You move
in every direction and you don't know

17:46.737 --> 17:50.579
where you are going. As long as your ego
is satisfied,

17:50.780 --> 17:55.161
you go ahead with it, and by the time you
discover that you have really become

17:55.362 --> 18:01.129
a humpty-dumpty, you do not know what you
have done to yourself.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.411
So the best way to conquer your ego is

18:04.612 --> 18:10.226
to speak sweetly first of all. It’s such
a small thing to be done

18:10.427 --> 18:18.682
but it brings you to that synthesis
of character within yourself first of all,

18:18.883 --> 18:25.300
and to the synthesis of all the beautiful
principles of lives.

18:25.501 --> 18:28.628
Like you talk to somebody sweetly,

18:28.829 --> 18:32.843
the person may like you. He may tell you
something,

18:33.044 --> 18:38.496
which he may be knowing of a very great
importance for you.

18:38.697 --> 18:46.465
If you talk to somebody sweetly, then you
may get the peace of mind

18:46.666 --> 18:50.095
because you have given peace to another
person.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.528
Whatever you give to another person, that
you feel within yourself.

18:53.729 --> 18:57.674
But if you are quarreling with another
person actually it is the reflection

18:57.875 --> 19:00.836
of your quarrelling nature within yourself.

19:01.037 --> 19:05.403
Today there is a big dearth, and big cry
and big organizations

19:05.604 --> 19:11.944
working out the peace missions. The peace
mission is within yourself.

19:12.145 --> 19:16.607
Let us start all of us the Sahaja Yogis who
are great saints sitting here,

19:16.808 --> 19:21.159
decide today that we are going to make
peace with ourselves and with others.

19:21.360 --> 19:26.641
But first and foremost thing the peace
cannot be made with quarrels.

19:26.842 --> 19:30.139
You see, like America and Russia want
to decide it

19:30.340 --> 19:36.438
with missiles, the peace part. They say,
“Let’s fight out.

19:36.639 --> 19:39.433
As many as will remain, then they can live
in peace.

19:39.634 --> 19:42.412
Let us all those who are fighting kill each
other”.

19:42.613 --> 19:46.702
They think this is the solution
of the problem. It's the other way around.

19:46.903 --> 19:52.917
Let everybody live peacefully within
themselves and give peace to others,

19:53.118 --> 19:59.939
so that this peace will become a nucleus
for the peace of the world.

20:00.140 --> 20:10.483
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

20:10.684 --> 20:14.160
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

20:14.361 --> 20:18.110
You are sitting in complete peace and
happiness and joy,

20:18.311 --> 20:23.036
you don't know, you are emitting all that
peace, channelizing it and doing it.

20:23.237 --> 20:30.746
But still there are some who are suffering
from horrible ego, and with hurt ego;

20:30.947 --> 20:37.134
and they are trying to do something, which
they should never do, is to think just now.

20:37.345 --> 20:41.246
If you are thinking just now, you will not
register what I am saying

20:41.447 --> 20:47.544
because this is another quality of a person
who is ego oriented is not to register.

20:47.745 --> 20:50.056
You may say anything you like but they
don't hear.

20:50.257 --> 20:53.351
They hear what they want to hear or they
don't hear.

20:53.551 --> 20:57.317
So this is another thing we have to today
decide,

20:57.518 --> 21:04.038
that we’ll register things than to tell
off. Let us register.

21:04.239 --> 21:11.332
This is a sign of a character that wants
to know; wants to know more about;

21:11.533 --> 21:17.958
the criteria of ascent is synthesis and
integration.

21:18.159 --> 21:25.950
A person who is not integrated with other
Sahaja Yogis is not a man who has ascended.

21:26.151 --> 21:29.978
Who tries to divide and talk of divisions.

21:30.179 --> 21:35.248
“We the English, We the Germans, We
the Indians,”

21:35.449 --> 21:39.568
then they are not Sahaja Yogis. They are
Indians all right, but not Sahaja Yogis.

21:39.769 --> 21:44.343
Sahaja Yogis have no caste, creed or
nationality.

21:44.544 --> 21:49.580
We have to carry our passports only because
we are born in this jail.

21:49.781 --> 21:54.441
So we have to carry our criminal number!

21:56.447 --> 22:01.099
But actually you don't need it. You don't
need all those things.

22:01.300 --> 22:05.643
Now for us today to decide first of all
in our hearts

22:05.844 --> 22:08.727
that we’ll take to peaceful methods.

22:08.928 --> 22:12.755
When we are travelling, we’ll be taking
to peaceful methods.

22:12.956 --> 22:17.964
Anybody who is trying to provoke you or
trying to create a problem

22:18.165 --> 22:25.490
or divide you on any issue whatsoever, run
away from that person as fast as possible.

22:25.691 --> 22:32.330
Anybody who talks of peace, the peace-
makers, stick on to that person -

22:32.832 --> 22:38.332
then only you will understand that you are
also getting peace.

22:39.697 --> 22:45.639
Here you have come to get peace, not
to create problems,

22:45.840 --> 22:51.264
or to listen to your problems, but to get
to peace.

22:51.465 --> 23:00.710
Peace is a nature or is the quality of your
Spirit.

23:00.911 --> 23:06.032
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

23:06.233 --> 23:14.050
what happens that you go beyond the cause
and the effect.

23:14.251 --> 23:17.001
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

23:17.202 --> 23:22.041
So the cause disappears and the effect also
disappears.

23:22.242 --> 23:28.786
So today we all have come here to worship
the peace, the within and the without.

23:28.987 --> 23:33.819
Let us be peaceful people. Let us not join
groups who hate,

23:34.020 --> 23:38.654
who talk big, who want to hate one person,
want to create a group,

23:38.855 --> 23:44.342
who says "we the Americans" or "we
the this", just.

23:44.543 --> 23:51.081
In Sahaja Yoga you must learn from people
who have advanced,

23:51.282 --> 23:56.664
who have very much progressed. For example
I would say among all the Europeans,

23:56.865 --> 24:02.309
Australians have done very well. There’s
nothing to feel jealous.

24:03.629 --> 24:07.915
All right, if Australians have done well,
alright that's your glory.

24:08.115 --> 24:12.437
So ask them how they have done it, how
they have worked it out.

24:12.638 --> 24:20.855
Tomorrow may be that Americans - I wish
that very much - may do the best,

24:21.392 --> 24:26.227
so then you should ask them how have you
done so well.

24:26.428 --> 24:30.559
That's the way we’re going to live. We are
not going to compete,

24:30.760 --> 24:35.103
we are not going to be jealous, but we are
going to absorb all that is best.

24:35.315 --> 24:38.191
This is Sahaja Yoga. Is the other way
around,

24:38.392 --> 24:41.674
like if they discover something -
a pilotless bomb -

24:41.875 --> 24:46.433
then they will discover something else
which is a machine-less bomb.

24:46.634 --> 24:52.706
No, it is another one. We develop a mind
which absorbs everything,

24:52.907 --> 24:57.707
and then we develop a bigger mind, which
gives everything.

24:57.908 --> 25:03.530
There is no secret in Sahaja Yoga. Everybody
who has known something better,

25:03.731 --> 25:07.797
has had some good experiences of Sahaja Yoga
should tell.

25:07.998 --> 25:10.977
But then in ego I have seen people start
preaching

25:11.178 --> 25:14.995
that, “All right, this method you try, that
method you try”.

25:15.196 --> 25:19.819
There is no need to do that also, because
of lack of discretion.

25:20.020 --> 25:23.464
If you had discretion you would have known
that this is not to be done.

25:23.665 --> 25:26.768
What is not to be done in Sahaja Yoga is
not to be done.

25:26.969 --> 25:31.940
But how will you know when you have no
discretion, like a lost ship.

25:32.141 --> 25:39.141
So then you have to see how your Mother
would act at such a position

25:39.633 --> 25:44.756
and then I’m sure you’ll go beyond the cause
and the effect.

25:44.957 --> 25:48.863
So today is the day I should also not say
anything

25:49.064 --> 25:53.709
that is in any way hurting to anyone

25:53.910 --> 25:59.819
and I am trying to make you smile and laugh
but you are so serious.

26:01.696 --> 26:07.629
So today we decide on peace. Peace with
ourselves, peace with others

26:07.830 --> 26:13.437
and that is how we worship the sun, Christ,
the One who was the emblem,

26:13.638 --> 26:21.845
who was the absolute practical symbol
of that peace.

26:22.584 --> 26:30.002
And once you understand this, I am sure you
will try to follow that, instead of

26:30.203 --> 26:35.206
hitting everybody, getting angry with
everybody. Just forget all these things.

26:35.407 --> 26:40.069
You have come here to ascend and your gain
is your gain.

26:40.270 --> 26:43.372
Your fighting is not your gain, remember
that.

26:43.573 --> 26:48.393
Your quarrelling is not your gain. The gain
is the peace that you have achieved,

26:48.594 --> 26:53.142
the love that you have developed,
the compassion that you can emit,

26:53.343 --> 26:57.911
the amount of relationship and the rapport
you can penetrate into others.

26:58.112 --> 27:01.796
This is your gain which we have to receive
today:

27:01.997 --> 27:08.376
a mind, a heart like a lion, and not
chicken-hearted people.

27:08.577 --> 27:14.294
Not people who would be angry and this,
to boast of your anger:

27:14.495 --> 27:19.428
these days are gone, we boast of our peace,
we boast of our contentment,

27:19.629 --> 27:26.251
we boast of our glory and we boast of our
state.

27:26.819 --> 27:31.189
And that is the state where we are now
in the Kingdom of God.

27:31.390 --> 27:34.460
May God bless you all!

27:35.433 --> 27:40.730
(Then Shri Mataji continues in Marathi
for about 12 minutes)

40:19.886 --> 40:26.088
The biggest problem is there – who is going
to now come for the puja.

40:27.274 --> 40:32.793
It’s easy to give a lecture, but to practice
it is very difficult.

40:45.938 --> 40:50.890
Those who have not yet worshipped Me
raise your hands.

41:06.339 --> 41:09.257
Now, I would suggest one thing:

41:09.458 --> 41:14.670
that all those who have not worshipped
must give their namens to Warren.

41:14.871 --> 41:22.846
And at every puja we can have ten persons
from foreign

41:23.053 --> 41:30.621
and ten persons from the indians, alright?
And one person - he -

41:30.822 --> 41:34.230
or anybody who is supposed to be the priest,
the great, you see.

41:34.431 --> 41:40.421
So, we have twenty-one people. Now, any
ten pople, meaning persons,

41:40.622 --> 41:47.777
meaning ladies and gentlemen, ten from
the foreign countries without fighting

41:49.201 --> 41:56.358
and ten persons without fighting
from indians.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.237
Come along, come along.

42:11.440 --> 42:14.924
This is twenty second.

43:12.981 --> 43:17.070
Take out. Can you take this out?

43:17.271 --> 43:21.353
Hello? Can we somebody arrange this to be
taken away

43:21.554 --> 43:27.899
and put it for the pandits on that side?
Can you remove it?
