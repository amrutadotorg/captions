00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:07.229
Now how do you do it in Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.778
As you have the photograph you may use it.
Put a light before the photograph.

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:15.762
Light is the way you cure your Agnya Chakra.

00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:20.219
Always. Light or the sun. Because Christ resides in the sun.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.885
So what you do, is to put a light in front.

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:30.010
Take another light behind and give an Aarti to your Agnya Chakra

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:38.802
at the back. It is resided by Maha Ganapati and Maha Bhairava.

00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:43.635
So you just give it an Aarti and Agnya Chakra will open.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:47.677
But how do you open this ? Very simple thing is that,

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:50.302
any thought comes to you, you should say 'I forgive'.

00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:53.344
This is the greatest weapon Christ has given us.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.386
You just say 'I forgive, I forgive',

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:57.760
and you can overcome your ego.

00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:01.052
This is the mantra for this Chakra in the front,

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:04.052
where you just say 'I forgive, I forgive, I forgive'

00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:06.551
and you will find your Agnya Chakra will open out

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.942
and you will find your ego will go away.

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:12.677
Forgiveness is one of the 'biggest' weapons human beings have got.

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.635
But they are so stupid if I tell them 'Forgive.

00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:19.999
Now what is there not to forgive ?'
They say it is very difficult to forgive.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.679
I say what is so difficult ? What are you doing ?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.802
Are you doing something when you are saying,

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:27.469
I am forgiving. Do you do something ? Nothing.

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.469
On the contrary when you do not forgive,

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.052
then what is happening is, the person whom you do not forgive,

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:38.094
is actually torturing you, while you are not torturing that person.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:42.885
So this is the mantra of the Agnya Chakra in front,

00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:46.302
and at the back, as I told you, you have to move the Light.

00:01:46.344 --> 00:01:48.843
Now somebody will, you see, one day they will do,

00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:52.398
two days they will do, - that is not how the Sahaja yoga is to be worked out.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.272
You have to really go all out to do it,

00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:57.635
and I have seen people who had eyes which were all bent like this,

00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:00.052
they could never raise their eyes, are now,

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.511
have open eyes, proper eyes with this working.

00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:05.718
It is 'very' simple to be done.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.219
There is one more thing that happens to our eyes.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:12.344
When the Swadishthana Chakra goes out of order.

00:02:12.344 --> 00:02:15.344
It is represented here at the back,

00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:19.344
which is 'around' this back Agnya.

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:22.219
So when you have diabetes or anything like that,

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.843
people start becoming blind. Because this Swadishthana Chakra

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:30.760
which is around, goes on pressing it and that is how,

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:39.052
that part which is surrounding this center, oppresses

00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:45.802
and augments that centre, so that the eyes cannot see;

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.052
there is no light. There is darkness and people have eyes open.

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:52.718
You have seen many diabetic people get this blindness.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.302
So first of all cure your diabetes through curing your Swadishthana.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:09.969
And also you can use an ice around your Swadishthana at the back.

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.843
But first of all if you improve your Swadishthana

00:03:13.843 --> 00:03:15.843
you will feel very much better.

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:21.760
So the treatment of the front side is with the light.

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:26.760
And the treatment of the back is with the water.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.635
But the best is also to use the light or the water

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:34.427
whichever way you like. Because if it is Swadishthana

00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:39.219
you have to use the water but if it is 'just' the possession,

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.010
then you have to use - without diabetes, if it is a possession --

00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:45.219
then you have to just use the light.

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.473
That is how we cure our Agnya Chakra.
