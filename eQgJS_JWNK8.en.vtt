00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:24.106
From yesterday's program

00:04:25.343 --> 00:04:27.849
and all these days,

00:04:28.777 --> 00:04:30.921
you must have realized

00:04:32.307 --> 00:04:42.037
that to get your Kundalini working out,

00:04:42.624 --> 00:04:50.257
to get Her rush towards the Sahasrara

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:55.786
and to widen your Shushumna Nadi,

00:04:56.553 --> 00:05:04.569
it is not necessary that you should sit for meditation for 3 to 5 hours.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:08.756
Of course, you must meditate for a short time

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:14.686
because that is at a point

00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:20.735
where you are alone one with your God.

00:05:22.536 --> 00:05:31.580
But otherwise in the collective when you merge into it

00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.483
then the Kundalini rises the same way.

00:05:35.683 --> 00:05:47.398
It's a very discrete way of understanding what happens.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.870
In the collective when you are,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.957
you compensate each other, complement each other

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:07.522
and the subtler side of the cosmos starts manifesting in you.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:11.767
Then if you could really merge,

00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:16.358
there is a word 'emerge' in Sanskrit language or in Marati language

00:06:16.558 --> 00:06:21.086
is very good is 'ramamaana'.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.493
I don't think merging with joy

00:06:28.693 --> 00:06:33.191
but there is no 'with' you see, merging into joy.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.382
So if you can merge into the joy

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:42.150
of anything that is Sahaj

00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:50.627
you can become

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:56.494
a meditative personality.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:07.056
You can achieve that meditative mood within yourself.

00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:12.017
With that mood, with that force,

00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:19.391
new subtler dimensions start breaking out within you.

00:07:19.591 --> 00:07:24.185
Your different kind of conditionings,

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:30.987
which are like shackles binding you down,

00:07:31.187 --> 00:07:33.441
just open out

00:07:33.642 --> 00:07:39.171
and you become a free person - 'Bandhamukta'.

00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:45.005
With that force everything breaks, your ego breaks,

00:07:45.205 --> 00:07:54.801
your conditioning breaks and you become one with the

00:07:55.001 --> 00:08:02.572
joy of life, divine life.

00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:11.298
This you can experience

00:08:11.498 --> 00:08:20.084
but to retain it within yourself

00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:28.316
is only possible if you do your practices in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:34.536
To control your attention,

00:08:34.736 --> 00:08:39.615
to keep your attention to higher values,

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:43.878
to the higher things.

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:49.694
Let us see what are

00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:59.024
the low value system that we get into

00:08:59.224 --> 00:09:04.367
which is regarded as something very important otherwise.

00:09:08.558 --> 00:09:19.509
The first in the modern times is the consciousness of time.

00:09:20.382 --> 00:09:24.277
What is the time now? What time we have to reach?

00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:27.769
Oh God what is the time we are going to start it?

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:30.372
What time are we going to sleep?

00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:34.016
Now we have experienced that yesterday we went home about

00:09:34.016 --> 00:09:37.016
6 o'clock and slept at 6 if we slept at all.

00:09:39.697 --> 00:09:42.807
You were quite tired till 2 o'clock I think

00:09:43.008 --> 00:09:48.066
then that 'Gondhari' business [Bhajan, "Mateche Gondhari"] started

00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:53.261
and you again relived the whole sequence

00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:57.199
with a greater gusto I must say.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.239
So at that time those people who try to keep dignity

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:06.246
and try to keep out of it

00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:10.371
are still keeping down their conditionings.

00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:14.745
Supposing there is a man who is a governor,

00:10:14.945 --> 00:10:20.452
for example, quite healthy, young can dance.

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:23.571
I mean old people need not do all that but they can

00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:30.087
at least break through very well into the barriers of conditionings.

00:10:30.288 --> 00:10:33.727
but such a person starts thinking "what's this going on" and

00:10:33.927 --> 00:10:38.762
"oh, it is nonsense, how can I join this?"

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.159
It looks very rustic, sometimes looks something not very decent,

00:10:44.359 --> 00:10:50.232
decorous, like a waltz, but

00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:57.732
It's extremely natural and child like, innocent.

00:11:01.074 --> 00:11:05.556
You can make out the people who are still in the barrier.

00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:10.403
They even find it difficult to say "Jai Mataji!".

00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:17.116
Such people are still bound down by the shackles

00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:19.697
of the worldly life.

00:11:19.897 --> 00:11:22.097
Then they are all the time, seeing the time, "What is the time?"

00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:24.869
And again getting a headache. At such times,

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:27.284
you should never see the time. Because you will get a headache

00:11:27.484 --> 00:11:30.474
if you see it.

00:11:30.674 --> 00:11:33.506
Realizing it’s very late, you see,

00:11:33.706 --> 00:11:38.444
and you say: "Oh God, it's 4 o'clock, we are still here."

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:46.332
So it is important for all of us not to have any watches

00:11:46.532 --> 00:11:48.658
and even if we have, not to see them.

00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:53.937
Or even you see them, they should be stopped.

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:58.566
So you go beyond time.

00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:03.336
You go beyond time. You don't feel the time.

00:12:03.536 --> 00:12:08.672
You don't feel the tiredness of time

00:12:08.872 --> 00:12:14.482
and you just forget yourself,

00:12:14.682 --> 00:12:19.396
which is tied down by time all the time.

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:29.857
Now then the second one is we talk so much.

00:12:30.057 --> 00:12:33.460
"Oh we should have no religions, no jati (caste), no pati,"

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.984
like that we say, all of us, "you should have no caste system",

00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:39.893
Indians especially: "Caste system is the curse."

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.154
People will talk like that and when it comes

00:12:43.154 --> 00:12:47.450
to their own daughters' wedding they will not go beyond their caste.

00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:50.184
"Caste system is bad." "Your religion is bad,

00:12:50.385 --> 00:12:52.601
this is bad, that bad",

00:12:52.802 --> 00:12:57.014
but when it comes to actual understanding of religion,

00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:59.690
you can easily scratch them [beneath the surface] and find out

00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:03.483
from where they come.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:10.293
Worst of all the conditioning is, of so-called religions!

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.181
And this has to be broken completely

00:13:16.381 --> 00:13:21.064
because they are all false,

00:13:21.738 --> 00:13:24.784
[but] based on something solid. Supposing you have

00:13:24.984 --> 00:13:30.055
a very solid foundation on that you put up a

00:13:30.255 --> 00:13:34.936
house of, say, a pack of cards, as they say.

00:13:35.136 --> 00:13:38.166
How long it is going to last?

00:13:38.366 --> 00:13:40.942
If you go to the foundations you find all the foundations

00:13:41.142 --> 00:13:45.785
are just the same but this pack of cards are different.

00:13:45.985 --> 00:13:50.595
And they are the greatest delusions for human beings

00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:54.016
which we are seeing every day, in every religion,

00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:57.627
in every country, in every caste.

00:13:57.827 --> 00:14:02.215
But still we are frightened of something nonsensical,

00:14:02.415 --> 00:14:06.643
something historical or I don't know what.

00:14:06.843 --> 00:14:09.667
We don't want to give up that.

00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:19.983
That’s another very big binding force

00:14:20.184 --> 00:14:24.511
to very low-grade life.

00:14:24.712 --> 00:14:29.302
I mean, say two caste people meet, same people,

00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:33.706
how do they talk? “Oh so you are of the same caste?”

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.684
He says, "Yes I am." "Then you must be knowing this man."

00:14:36.884 --> 00:14:40.696
"Yes, yes. He’s my father's brother's, this thing’s, this thing".

00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:45.400
In Marathi, they’d say “sakhaa”.

00:14:46.598 --> 00:14:52.042
“Sakyatla sakhaa”. [Means what?].

00:14:53.304 --> 00:14:59.030
Like that: “Oh, so you are the cousin’s sister's,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.751
this thing, that thing, real husband!”

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:12.130
And such terrible talks! I don't know, they go on for hours together.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.091
And then I don't know what is the satisfaction out of it.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:21.447
Then ultimately they did this, this - they,

00:15:21.647 --> 00:15:25.296
they find out sometimes, or mostly,

00:15:25.496 --> 00:15:31.811
that both of them are related to a 'dacoit' [armed thief]

00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:36.365
or to a thug or some sort of a bankrupt

00:15:36.565 --> 00:15:42.018
or some sort of a horrible man and then they recede back.

00:15:42.218 --> 00:15:46.821
Then they don't want to show any relationship.

00:15:47.504 --> 00:15:50.756
So, this kind of a nonsensical talks,

00:15:50.956 --> 00:15:55.345
for example, if the ladies meet, "Oh" they will say,

00:15:55.545 --> 00:15:57.989
"Where did you buy this sari?" "I bought it there".

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.908
"Oh, I went there. How much you paid?" She said, “This [much]”

00:16:01.108 --> 00:16:05.256
Such waste of time goes on and on and on and on and on.

00:16:05.456 --> 00:16:07.732
The whole life is wasted

00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:13.316
in such a low-grade understanding of life's value.

00:16:13.816 --> 00:16:16.042
Then they will also talk ill [of others], do this -

00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:19.553
I mean you can build up on that all the filth.

00:16:19.753 --> 00:16:22.251
It's something like the fungus growing.

00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:26.685
From the dead, with little heat the fungus starts growing,

00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:30.796
mutation takes place, and the fungus becomes aggressive,

00:16:30.996 --> 00:16:33.308
can become cancerous, this, that.

00:16:33.508 --> 00:16:39.349
In the same way all this low grade life starts.

00:16:46.894 --> 00:16:52.705
Then this low grade life can extend in every walk of life,

00:16:52.905 --> 00:16:56.284
like politics, economics, everywhere,

00:16:56.484 --> 00:17:01.530
because it is like plastic.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.447
Plastic can get into cloth, can get into trees,

00:17:05.647 --> 00:17:08.807
can get into everything.

00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:14.193
In the same way this horrible low-grade business

00:17:14.393 --> 00:17:19.273
goes into these various things

00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:22.058
and a person cannot rise

00:17:22.258 --> 00:17:29.790
above this built-in plastic bondages we have.

00:17:31.076 --> 00:17:36.911
At this time when we have such kind of programmes,

00:17:37.111 --> 00:17:39.561
everything breaks off

00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:50.155
and you really dissolve into the love of God.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.834
There are so many other mundane things if you see how people talk,

00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:59.034
how they joke and all that.

00:17:59.235 --> 00:18:02.420
You will think it’s all filth going round you.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.143
Slowly you will gradually recede from it.

00:18:06.343 --> 00:18:09.357
That is how you prepare yourself

00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:13.885
for retaining this joy within yourself.

00:18:14.917 --> 00:18:20.240
Now we are coming to the fag-end of our tours

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.398
and when you will be going to your countries

00:18:23.598 --> 00:18:28.581
you should see for yourself what's happening around

00:18:28.781 --> 00:18:32.303
and just laugh and get out of it.

00:18:32.503 --> 00:18:37.064
You have to remember those beautiful days of Ganapatipule

00:18:37.264 --> 00:18:40.634
and you have to get into that mood

00:18:40.834 --> 00:18:45.525
and know that you belong to the Kingdom of God.

00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:50.624
I know we had very little time to talk

00:18:50.824 --> 00:18:53.672
but music was even better. I could communicate better

00:18:53.872 --> 00:18:55.872
through music to you.

00:18:56.073 --> 00:18:59.061
I’m working on you all the time

00:18:59.261 --> 00:19:02.611
but still there are some people who are caught up.

00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:05.309
I would request you, for all the leaders who find out

00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:08.277
there are caught up people in their groups -

00:19:08.477 --> 00:19:11.482
please don't call them for the pujas.

00:19:11.682 --> 00:19:14.713
They should be kept back if you think they are not alright.

00:19:14.914 --> 00:19:16.960
And they should not also feel bad

00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:21.701
because they will be helped much
more if they don't come to the puja.

00:19:21.902 --> 00:19:25.131
So tomorrow is going to be the great day for our puja.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.671
I hope it will be convenient for all of you to come

00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:31.436
and be seated here.

00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:34.651
I think tomorrow, before coming to the puja don't talk too much

00:19:34.851 --> 00:19:37.111
and don't discuss too much.

00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:41.608
I think you must have had enough discussions today

00:19:41.808 --> 00:19:45.965
and have reached some conclusions.

00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:49.528
I would like to know if some questions were not answered.

00:19:49.728 --> 00:19:52.201
If there is any I would like to answer them now

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:54.979
and after that we’ll start our programme. For about five minutes,

00:19:55.179 --> 00:19:58.925
are sufficient for answering.

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:13.402
All questions were answered?

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:18.933
Is there any question that was not answered?

00:20:19.132 --> 00:20:26.073
Please stand up, I can't see if there is anybody.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.723
Oh, ho, that's Sahaj!

00:20:37.923 --> 00:20:43.113
Sahaj people have no questions. They have to only answer.
