04:20.662 --> 04:24.106
From yesterday's program

04:25.343 --> 04:27.849
and all these days,

04:28.777 --> 04:30.921
you must have realized

04:32.307 --> 04:42.037
that to get your Kundalini working out,

04:42.624 --> 04:50.257
to get Her rush towards the Sahasrara

04:50.457 --> 04:55.786
and to widen your Shushumna Nadi,

04:56.553 --> 05:04.569
it is not necessary that you should sit for meditation for 3 to 5 hours.

05:05.079 --> 05:08.756
Of course, you must meditate for a short time

05:08.957 --> 05:14.686
because that is at a point

05:14.886 --> 05:20.735
where you are alone one with your God.

05:22.536 --> 05:31.580
But otherwise in the collective when you merge into it

05:31.781 --> 05:35.483
then the Kundalini rises the same way.

05:35.683 --> 05:47.398
It's a very discrete way of understanding what happens.

05:48.319 --> 05:51.870
In the collective when you are,

05:52.070 --> 05:56.957
you compensate each other, complement each other

05:57.157 --> 06:07.522
and the subtler side of the cosmos starts manifesting in you.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.767
Then if you could really merge,

06:11.967 --> 06:16.358
there is a word 'emerge' in Sanskrit language or in Marati language

06:16.558 --> 06:21.086
is very good is 'ramamaana'.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.493
I don't think merging with joy

06:28.693 --> 06:33.191
but there is no 'with' you see, merging into joy.

06:33.390 --> 06:38.382
So if you can merge into the joy

06:38.583 --> 06:42.150
of anything that is Sahaj

06:42.351 --> 06:50.627
you can become

06:50.827 --> 06:56.494
a meditative personality.

06:58.986 --> 07:07.056
You can achieve that meditative mood within yourself.

07:07.256 --> 07:12.017
With that mood, with that force,

07:12.218 --> 07:19.391
new subtler dimensions start breaking out within you.

07:19.591 --> 07:24.185
Your different kind of conditionings,

07:24.385 --> 07:30.987
which are like shackles binding you down,

07:31.187 --> 07:33.441
just open out

07:33.642 --> 07:39.171
and you become a free person - 'Bandhamukta'.

07:40.651 --> 07:45.005
With that force everything breaks, your ego breaks,

07:45.205 --> 07:54.801
your conditioning breaks and you become one with the

07:55.001 --> 08:02.572
joy of life, divine life.

08:04.638 --> 08:11.298
This you can experience

08:11.498 --> 08:20.084
but to retain it within yourself

08:20.284 --> 08:28.316
is only possible if you do your practices in Sahaja Yoga.

08:29.125 --> 08:34.536
To control your attention,

08:34.736 --> 08:39.615
to keep your attention to higher values,

08:39.815 --> 08:43.878
to the higher things.

08:46.291 --> 08:49.694
Let us see what are

08:49.894 --> 08:59.024
the low value system that we get into

08:59.224 --> 09:04.367
which is regarded as something very important otherwise.

09:08.558 --> 09:19.509
The first in the modern times is the consciousness of time.

09:20.382 --> 09:24.277
What is the time now? What time we have to reach?

09:24.477 --> 09:27.769
Oh God what is the time we are going to start it?

09:27.969 --> 09:30.372
What time are we going to sleep?

09:30.572 --> 09:34.016
Now we have experienced that yesterday we went home about

09:34.016 --> 09:37.016
6 o'clock and slept at 6 if we slept at all.

09:39.697 --> 09:42.807
You were quite tired till 2 o'clock I think

09:43.008 --> 09:48.066
then that 'Gondhari' business [Bhajan, "Mateche Gondhari"] started

09:48.066 --> 09:53.261
and you again relived the whole sequence

09:53.461 --> 09:57.199
with a greater gusto I must say.

09:57.890 --> 10:02.239
So at that time those people who try to keep dignity

10:02.439 --> 10:06.246
and try to keep out of it

10:06.446 --> 10:10.371
are still keeping down their conditionings.

10:10.571 --> 10:14.745
Supposing there is a man who is a governor,

10:14.945 --> 10:20.452
for example, quite healthy, young can dance.

10:20.652 --> 10:23.571
I mean old people need not do all that but they can

10:23.771 --> 10:30.087
at least break through very well into the barriers of conditionings.

10:30.288 --> 10:33.727
but such a person starts thinking "what's this going on" and

10:33.927 --> 10:38.762
"oh, it is nonsense, how can I join this?"

10:39.200 --> 10:44.159
It looks very rustic, sometimes looks something not very decent,

10:44.359 --> 10:50.232
decorous, like a waltz, but

10:50.677 --> 10:57.732
It's extremely natural and child like, innocent.

11:01.074 --> 11:05.556
You can make out the people who are still in the barrier.

11:05.756 --> 11:10.403
They even find it difficult to say "Jai Mataji!".

11:10.975 --> 11:17.116
Such people are still bound down by the shackles

11:17.316 --> 11:19.697
of the worldly life.

11:19.897 --> 11:22.097
Then they are all the time, seeing the time, "What is the time?"

11:22.297 --> 11:24.869
And again getting a headache. At such times,

11:25.069 --> 11:27.284
you should never see the time. Because you will get a headache

11:27.484 --> 11:30.474
if you see it.

11:30.674 --> 11:33.506
Realizing it’s very late, you see,

11:33.706 --> 11:38.444
and you say: "Oh God, it's 4 o'clock, we are still here."

11:41.059 --> 11:46.332
So it is important for all of us not to have any watches

11:46.532 --> 11:48.658
and even if we have, not to see them.

11:48.858 --> 11:53.937
Or even you see them, they should be stopped.

11:54.755 --> 11:58.566
So you go beyond time.

11:58.766 --> 12:03.336
You go beyond time. You don't feel the time.

12:03.536 --> 12:08.672
You don't feel the tiredness of time

12:08.872 --> 12:14.482
and you just forget yourself,

12:14.682 --> 12:19.396
which is tied down by time all the time.

12:22.975 --> 12:29.857
Now then the second one is we talk so much.

12:30.057 --> 12:33.460
"Oh we should have no religions, no jati (caste), no pati,"

12:33.660 --> 12:36.984
like that we say, all of us, "you should have no caste system",

12:37.184 --> 12:39.893
Indians especially: "Caste system is the curse."

12:40.093 --> 12:43.154
People will talk like that and when it comes

12:43.154 --> 12:47.450
to their own daughters' wedding they will not go beyond their caste.

12:47.651 --> 12:50.184
"Caste system is bad." "Your religion is bad,

12:50.385 --> 12:52.601
this is bad, that bad",

12:52.802 --> 12:57.014
but when it comes to actual understanding of religion,

12:57.214 --> 12:59.690
you can easily scratch them [beneath the surface] and find out

12:59.891 --> 13:03.483
from where they come.

13:03.690 --> 13:10.293
Worst of all the conditioning is, of so-called religions!

13:12.960 --> 13:16.181
And this has to be broken completely

13:16.381 --> 13:21.064
because they are all false,

13:21.738 --> 13:24.784
[but] based on something solid. Supposing you have

13:24.984 --> 13:30.055
a very solid foundation on that you put up a

13:30.255 --> 13:34.936
house of, say, a pack of cards, as they say.

13:35.136 --> 13:38.166
How long it is going to last?

13:38.366 --> 13:40.942
If you go to the foundations you find all the foundations

13:41.142 --> 13:45.785
are just the same but this pack of cards are different.

13:45.985 --> 13:50.595
And they are the greatest delusions for human beings

13:50.795 --> 13:54.016
which we are seeing every day, in every religion,

13:54.216 --> 13:57.627
in every country, in every caste.

13:57.827 --> 14:02.215
But still we are frightened of something nonsensical,

14:02.415 --> 14:06.643
something historical or I don't know what.

14:06.843 --> 14:09.667
We don't want to give up that.

14:09.867 --> 14:19.983
That’s another very big binding force

14:20.184 --> 14:24.511
to very low-grade life.

14:24.712 --> 14:29.302
I mean, say two caste people meet, same people,

14:29.502 --> 14:33.706
how do they talk? “Oh so you are of the same caste?”

14:33.906 --> 14:36.684
He says, "Yes I am." "Then you must be knowing this man."

14:36.884 --> 14:40.696
"Yes, yes. He’s my father's brother's, this thing’s, this thing".

14:40.896 --> 14:45.400
In Marathi, they’d say “sakhaa”.

14:46.598 --> 14:52.042
“Sakyatla sakhaa”. [Means what?].

14:53.304 --> 14:59.030
Like that: “Oh, so you are the cousin’s sister's,

14:59.230 --> 15:03.751
this thing, that thing, real husband!”

15:06.473 --> 15:12.130
And such terrible talks! I don't know, they go on for hours together.

15:12.330 --> 15:16.091
And then I don't know what is the satisfaction out of it.

15:16.291 --> 15:21.447
Then ultimately they did this, this - they,

15:21.647 --> 15:25.296
they find out sometimes, or mostly,

15:25.496 --> 15:31.811
that both of them are related to a 'dacoit' [armed thief]

15:32.011 --> 15:36.365
or to a thug or some sort of a bankrupt

15:36.565 --> 15:42.018
or some sort of a horrible man and then they recede back.

15:42.218 --> 15:46.821
Then they don't want to show any relationship.

15:47.504 --> 15:50.756
So, this kind of a nonsensical talks,

15:50.956 --> 15:55.345
for example, if the ladies meet, "Oh" they will say,

15:55.545 --> 15:57.989
"Where did you buy this sari?" "I bought it there".

15:58.190 --> 16:00.908
"Oh, I went there. How much you paid?" She said, “This [much]”

16:01.108 --> 16:05.256
Such waste of time goes on and on and on and on and on.

16:05.456 --> 16:07.732
The whole life is wasted

16:07.932 --> 16:13.316
in such a low-grade understanding of life's value.

16:13.816 --> 16:16.042
Then they will also talk ill [of others], do this -

16:16.242 --> 16:19.553
I mean you can build up on that all the filth.

16:19.753 --> 16:22.251
It's something like the fungus growing.

16:22.451 --> 16:26.685
From the dead, with little heat the fungus starts growing,

16:26.885 --> 16:30.796
mutation takes place, and the fungus becomes aggressive,

16:30.996 --> 16:33.308
can become cancerous, this, that.

16:33.508 --> 16:39.349
In the same way all this low grade life starts.

16:46.894 --> 16:52.705
Then this low grade life can extend in every walk of life,

16:52.905 --> 16:56.284
like politics, economics, everywhere,

16:56.484 --> 17:01.530
because it is like plastic.

17:01.730 --> 17:05.447
Plastic can get into cloth, can get into trees,

17:05.647 --> 17:08.807
can get into everything.

17:09.381 --> 17:14.193
In the same way this horrible low-grade business

17:14.393 --> 17:19.273
goes into these various things

17:19.473 --> 17:22.058
and a person cannot rise

17:22.258 --> 17:29.790
above this built-in plastic bondages we have.

17:31.076 --> 17:36.911
At this time when we have such kind of programmes,

17:37.111 --> 17:39.561
everything breaks off

17:39.761 --> 17:50.155
and you really dissolve into the love of God.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.834
There are so many other mundane things if you see how people talk,

17:57.034 --> 17:59.034
how they joke and all that.

17:59.235 --> 18:02.420
You will think it’s all filth going round you.

18:02.620 --> 18:06.143
Slowly you will gradually recede from it.

18:06.343 --> 18:09.357
That is how you prepare yourself

18:09.557 --> 18:13.885
for retaining this joy within yourself.

18:14.917 --> 18:20.240
Now we are coming to the fag-end of our tours

18:20.440 --> 18:23.398
and when you will be going to your countries

18:23.598 --> 18:28.581
you should see for yourself what's happening around

18:28.781 --> 18:32.303
and just laugh and get out of it.

18:32.503 --> 18:37.064
You have to remember those beautiful days of Ganapatipule

18:37.264 --> 18:40.634
and you have to get into that mood

18:40.834 --> 18:45.525
and know that you belong to the Kingdom of God.

18:47.516 --> 18:50.624
I know we had very little time to talk

18:50.824 --> 18:53.672
but music was even better. I could communicate better

18:53.872 --> 18:55.872
through music to you.

18:56.073 --> 18:59.061
I’m working on you all the time

18:59.261 --> 19:02.611
but still there are some people who are caught up.

19:02.811 --> 19:05.309
I would request you, for all the leaders who find out

19:05.509 --> 19:08.277
there are caught up people in their groups -

19:08.477 --> 19:11.482
please don't call them for the pujas.

19:11.682 --> 19:14.713
They should be kept back if you think they are not alright.

19:14.914 --> 19:16.960
And they should not also feel bad

19:17.161 --> 19:21.701
because they will be helped much
more if they don't come to the puja.

19:21.902 --> 19:25.131
So tomorrow is going to be the great day for our puja.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.671
I hope it will be convenient for all of you to come

19:28.871 --> 19:31.436
and be seated here.

19:31.636 --> 19:34.651
I think tomorrow, before coming to the puja don't talk too much

19:34.851 --> 19:37.111
and don't discuss too much.

19:37.311 --> 19:41.608
I think you must have had enough discussions today

19:41.808 --> 19:45.965
and have reached some conclusions.

19:46.165 --> 19:49.528
I would like to know if some questions were not answered.

19:49.728 --> 19:52.201
If there is any I would like to answer them now

19:52.401 --> 19:54.979
and after that we’ll start our programme. For about five minutes,

19:55.179 --> 19:58.925
are sufficient for answering.

20:09.308 --> 20:13.402
All questions were answered?

20:14.125 --> 20:18.933
Is there any question that was not answered?

20:19.132 --> 20:26.073
Please stand up, I can't see if there is anybody.

20:33.970 --> 20:37.723
Oh, ho, that's Sahaj!

20:37.923 --> 20:43.113
Sahaj people have no questions. They have to only answer.
