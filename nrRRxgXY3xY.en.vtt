00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:10.011
What do You think are the
important points in the education of children?

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:12.896
 What are important to give
to the children?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.380
You see, first if they get realization,
to get first them to that point of realization,

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:24.296
if they are already born realized, no problem
but if they have, they're given realization,

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:28.403
then, you see, they start seeing from a
different level, they become the Spirit,

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:35.822
so their self-respect, you see, awakened.
Such children behave in a very dignified,

00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:41.060
elderly manner, you see, they talk in a
very elderly manner and they give solutions

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.084
of all kinds, you see, and they are
tremendous people. But we have to guide

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:50.776
them properly by our own behavior,
how we behave.

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:54.678
The greatest thing is, how we behave
that's how the children learn.

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:58.625
Basically, if a human being is all right in his childhood,

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:02.465
then fundamentals are all right for the child,  
the foundation is laid down.

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:07.173
Then to build that child up into a
good quality, is not difficult.

00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:13.772
So now we find, great artists are there,
there are great musicians and at a very

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.916
young age they have started playing violin
- I mean, suddenly they have become

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:22.818
dynamic also and very humble. They are
very humble and self-respecting and very

00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:27.465
well-behaved. It's surprising how the
atmosphere is and how it works out.

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:32.490
And the other day, the lady asked Me
about the women and I told her that,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.448
a woman's power as a mother is very great.

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:38.556
She felt hurt about it but I didn't mean,
that you should be just a mother.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:43.890
What I'm saying, she is a mother, means
she's compassionate, she's kind, she's not

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.053
aggressive like man - that is a very big
quality, that's a very big power in a woman,

00:01:49.053 --> 00:01:52.781
that's what I was suggesting, that that is
what we have to earn is. Not to compete

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:58.296
with men - it's madness. We have to
understand that life has to be

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:05.998
enjoyable, life should be a blessing,
not to be a misery.

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:10.305
We create our own miseries by these
false ideas, by our own

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:18.752
convictions we have in our mind, mental
projections we have in our mind or our own

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:24.889
obstinacy, whatever it is. All these things
can be cured, if you take to Sahaja yoga

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.534
because you become a balanced person, level
headed, wise person and you become a witness.

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:33.903
The whole thing becomes like a show, like
a drama and you become fearless, you start

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:37.955
seeing the whole thing like a drama. And
this is what a human being has to achieve.

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:43.654
We talk of peace, we talk of no war, we
talk of many things like this, you see,

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:48.221
atomic bomb, this, that - all that is not
going to work out. Only what is going to

00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:52.724
work out is the transformation of human
beings. If the human beings are transformed,

00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:58.358
things will work out absolutely first
class. Not only that but that they will

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:06.146
enjoy the bliss of life. We are missing the
point altogether. This is a very important

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:11.659
thing, that human beings must say one thing,
"What have we achieved out of all this?"

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.738
Just for a minute to stop and think.
