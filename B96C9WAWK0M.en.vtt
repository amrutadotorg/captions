00:29.400 --> 00:35.920
Now the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

00:36.120 --> 00:41.280
I am sure Mr. Gavin Brown must have explained to you what it is.

00:41.480 --> 00:48.000
And so many of you are from Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.920
So I need not explain to you all the details.

00:54.160 --> 00:59.600
But today we have to understand one thing

00:59.800 --> 01:04.520
that it’s a very serious time we are born into, extremely serious.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.280
And when we look at life

01:10.360 --> 01:14.280
we do not understand that

01:14.480 --> 01:19.120
if we miss this chance of our evolution,

01:19.320 --> 01:23.520
not only that we’ll miss it for ourselves,

01:23.720 --> 01:27.080
not only that we’ll miss it for England,

01:27.280 --> 01:29.520
or only for one country,

01:29.720 --> 01:33.640
but we’ll miss it for the whole creation.

01:34.320 --> 01:39.520
The trouble is, in the name of God,

01:39.800 --> 01:43.760
in the name of evolution,

01:46.880 --> 01:50.800
in the name of higher life,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.320
so many spurious people have come up

01:54.520 --> 01:59.240
that it has become impossible to convince anyone

01:59.440 --> 02:03.160
that there is something like truth left in it.

02:03.360 --> 02:06.320
Under these circumstances,

02:06.520 --> 02:09.120
one has to talk about truth

02:09.320 --> 02:11.480
and talking about truth

02:11.680 --> 02:15.120
doesn’t give you the experience of the truth at all.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.080
Discussing about it will not give you,

02:18.280 --> 02:22.280
it’s a different realm in which one has to go into,

02:22.480 --> 02:25.280
it’s a new awareness which you have to get,

02:25.480 --> 02:27.320
to understand the truth,

02:27.520 --> 02:31.640
for which I don’t know how many are prepared,

02:31.840 --> 02:34.480
and how many would like to know,

02:34.680 --> 02:39.040
and even if they like to know, how many will get it.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.120
So the problem is the other way round.

02:42.320 --> 02:46.080
It’s not the problem that you have few people,

02:46.280 --> 02:48.640
it’s not the problem

02:48.840 --> 02:52.440
that Sahaja Yoga cannot give you realization,

02:52.640 --> 02:58.160
it’s not the problem that you will not know the truth,

02:58.360 --> 03:01.880
but the whole circumstance is such,

03:02.080 --> 03:06.400
that whatever is false, whatever is spurious,

03:06.600 --> 03:12.040
whatever is silly, stupid, appeals to the masses.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.880
Sometimes I feel I have developed a method

03:15.080 --> 03:18.120
by which I can give really en masse realization

03:18.320 --> 03:19.560
all over the world,

03:19.760 --> 03:21.600
definitely I have.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.840
But the problem as it remains,

03:24.040 --> 03:26.080
the masses are not interested.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.600
It’s only very few who really can keenly take interest

03:30.800 --> 03:33.240
into their evolutionary process

03:33.440 --> 03:36.720
and would like to come out of the ignorance

03:36.920 --> 03:39.600
in which they have been living.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.400
In all the ego-oriented countries

03:42.600 --> 03:45.400
it’s very difficult to establish

03:45.600 --> 03:49.440
that we are still ignorant,

03:49.640 --> 03:52.800
we have to know a lot. It’s very difficult.

03:52.921 --> 03:54.719
Because they think we know everything,

03:54.840 --> 03:58.560
because we have been to the moon. Like the Russians say,

03:58.760 --> 04:03.400
‘We never saw God, we went to the moon, we never saw God.’

04:03.600 --> 04:05.920
It would be like saying that I have come

04:06.120 --> 04:08.720
to the third floor, I haven’t seen God.

04:08.920 --> 04:14.000
Where does God reside? Where it manifest within us?

04:14.200 --> 04:17.880
In what way it manifest, we don’t want to see.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.040
What we want to see is that through our effort,

04:21.240 --> 04:25.880
if we have not been able to see God, then He doesn’t exist.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.640
This is the way our attitude is,

04:28.840 --> 04:33.920
that better say, 'No,' to all that we did not know

04:34.120 --> 04:36.240
through our effort,

04:36.440 --> 04:40.920
because so far we have not known about Him.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.600
So He doesn’t exist.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.480
So you turn round in a cave

04:47.680 --> 04:51.480
when you see the shadows of yourself,

04:51.680 --> 04:53.880
you believe in them only and say,

04:54.080 --> 04:57.760
“It never existed anything else, the light does not exist.”

04:58.000 --> 05:00.400
That kind of an attitude exists

05:00.600 --> 05:05.600
or is persistently I am facing.

05:06.640 --> 05:14.320
And sometimes, I don’t know how to give them realization.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.000
Now as I said, it’s the other way round.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.240
You have to seek. You have to ask for it.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.640
You have to truly ask for it.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.920
Nobody is going to fall at your feet and say,

05:26.120 --> 05:28.120
‘All right, you get your realization.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.920
All right, you have this for heaven’s sake!'

05:32.120 --> 05:33.600
Just have it!

05:33.800 --> 05:35.720
Because nothing is selling here.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.240
We are so much used to the salesmanship, you see,

05:40.440 --> 05:43.800
that we think that if anything is selling,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.840
people have to persuade you, to request you, ask you,

05:49.040 --> 05:52.160
you can save pounds, you see, for sale and all that.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.160
But nothing is for sale.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.640
That’s a very difficult proposition to understand

06:01.840 --> 06:08.240
in the present atmosphere,

06:08.440 --> 06:14.480
where we do not know if you can get anything that is not for sale.

06:16.040 --> 06:21.800
But, I hope slowly and steadily,

06:23.800 --> 06:28.360
all of us have to get it.
