00:16.266 --> 00:19.266
Yogi: When Kundalini becomes with the spirit.

00:24.364 --> 00:28.522
A person becomes aware of that spirit
as silence and as becomes the witness,

00:28.722 --> 00:31.481
it's like when you're been on the outside of a roundabout,

00:31.681 --> 00:36.216
in a kiddies playground whirling round and you feel ill.

00:36.478 --> 00:38.675
And somehow,

00:38.875 --> 00:43.839
you go to the center of the roundabout
and you sit of the axis of the roundabout

00:44.039 --> 00:46.900
and then you can watch the whole
thing but you don't feel sick any more,

00:47.100 --> 00:49.911
you see it, you enjoy it but you don't feel giddy.

00:50.112 --> 00:53.350
[UNCLEAR]..even if you are falling off...hurt.

00:54.428 --> 00:58.677
So you become the witness
and you become silent and at peace.

00:58.878 --> 01:06.713
But more than that, you get the coolness of
the holy spirit or is the coolness of vibrations...

01:08.011 --> 01:12.420
and this coolness is the thing
which is the treatment [UNCLEAR]...

01:12.620 --> 01:16.420
which enables the Kundalini to rise.
To recognise that there is a holiness and...

01:16.621 --> 01:18.407
Shri Mataji: We can't hear you.

01:18.607 --> 01:20.549
Yogi: A purity.

01:21.096 --> 01:25.403
And that holiness, instance
and purity of the Divine vibrations

01:25.603 --> 01:27.444
is what makes this Kundalini to rise.

01:27.644 --> 01:32.278
It's the conditions which
enable the seed within us to sprout.

01:33.969 --> 01:38.869
One can then become aware of the mechanism inside,

01:39.069 --> 01:44.932
and can be aware of vibrations so
instead of just judging things on thoughts,

01:45.132 --> 01:50.563
or on feelings, on likes or dislikes
that we've got from pervious experiences.

01:50.763 --> 01:54.099
One can go on vibrations

01:54.299 --> 01:57.358
and going by vibrations means,

01:57.558 --> 02:02.100
that if something is incorrect it
is so because it is harmful to us.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.980
And it's harmful to us in very specific ways.

02:05.180 --> 02:09.575
These specific ways are to do with these centers within...

02:09.775 --> 02:15.465
so that if something is harmful it
damages [UNCLEAR] part of our being inside.

02:15.666 --> 02:19.550
And when you feel vibrations you
know, what it is that does the damage

02:19.750 --> 02:25.420
because immediately you feel - instead of a coolness
comes from something which is pure, natural and holy.

02:25.620 --> 02:28.682
You feel heat in a specific area.

02:29.060 --> 02:32.567
The chakras are reproduced in the finger tips

02:32.993 --> 02:39.042
so that one can feel if the hands
get hot or particular fingers get hot,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.739
it means that, that chakra is out of order

02:41.939 --> 02:46.800
or there's something which
would harm that chakra, is going on.

02:47.664 --> 02:54.221
And when all the problems and negativity are gone,
there's no problems any more then both hands feel very cool.

02:54.422 --> 02:57.673
Like a machine running very well, feels cool

02:57.873 --> 03:00.571
and when there's a problem develops heat,

03:00.771 --> 03:04.247
like a car engine when the water boils off.

03:07.299 --> 03:09.785
One more thing is that it's collective.

03:09.986 --> 03:15.423
A lot of our problems [UNCLEAR in cities] is that
we've been individuals trying to find our way in confusion...

03:15.624 --> 03:21.260
...Improves your own health and other peoples
health, your own conditions and their conditions.

03:22.016 --> 03:27.384
[UNCLEAR] also the greatest thing is
that you can give them self realisation as well

03:27.584 --> 03:31.195
because the Kundalini within you
is awakened and that is the thing,

03:31.396 --> 03:35.586
[vibrations - UNCLEAR] realisation to another person

03:35.786 --> 03:38.780
but it all comes down to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

03:38.980 --> 03:42.460
and that sometimes is difficult for people.

03:42.714 --> 03:46.591
But Shri Mataji has come to make
any money, there's no money to be made.

03:46.791 --> 03:50.420
This isn't a shop and we are not selling anything.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.456
This is a serious thing but a very joyful thing

03:53.657 --> 03:57.860
but we have to be very joyful and yet
treat it with a respect and a seriousness.

03:58.060 --> 04:00.961
That it is our baptism, it is the
possibility of us achieving something.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.205
Unfortunately many people say

04:03.405 --> 04:06.932
"Yes, I think I felt something, even though I don't
think I did", you don't [UNCLEAR worry] and that's it.

04:07.132 --> 04:12.007
And they never know the
riches and the treasure which it is.

04:14.349 --> 04:20.093
You can give realisation to others which means
that each person gets realisation in Sahaja Yoga

04:20.293 --> 04:22.699
becomes a guru themselves.

04:23.320 --> 04:27.940
It's not just we have the fortunate
to have somebody as a genuine Guru,

04:28.140 --> 04:32.841
who can give realisation, who does know
the science about the chakras inside, spiritually,

04:33.041 --> 04:35.094
emotionally, mentally and physically.

04:35.295 --> 04:41.020
But more, even greater in fact, the fact
She enables us to become gurus ourselves,

04:41.220 --> 04:43.391
in that we can then cure ourselves.

04:43.591 --> 04:47.351
We can - we know for ourselves
what's right and wrong on vibrations

04:47.551 --> 04:51.620
and we can then read the scriptures,
all the scriptures not just one book

04:51.820 --> 04:56.380
or another book of one sect
or one group but all scriptures.

04:56.580 --> 04:59.860
We can see [UNCLEAR] and we can enjoy it

05:00.060 --> 05:04.571
and we can share it and we
can grow in it when collectivity.

05:04.772 --> 05:09.567
Proper self realisation we become collectively aware

05:09.767 --> 05:13.020
and this is really what Sahaja Yoga is.

05:13.220 --> 05:18.370
It's this spontaneous self realisation,

05:18.570 --> 05:21.500
the fact that you become the spirit which is Divine.

05:21.700 --> 05:25.780
But then beyond that it's the
science of how to maintain it,

05:25.980 --> 05:32.020
Shri Mataji would describe and has told
us many times and then we can tell you.

05:32.220 --> 05:36.987
And also it's an evolution

05:37.187 --> 05:40.460
beyond being individuals and just ourselves

05:40.660 --> 05:42.940
and into being one with the whole and therefore

05:43.140 --> 05:46.533
becoming part and parcel of
the subtle being which is the Divine.

05:46.734 --> 05:51.860
Ladies and gentlemen, our very great
pleasure introduce you to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

06:09.757 --> 06:13.620
Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth.

06:19.502 --> 06:22.460
What we find true,

06:24.595 --> 06:30.660
can never be a mis-normal or cannot be misidentified.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.660
It cannot be misplaced

06:33.860 --> 06:36.380
nor can it be lost

06:36.892 --> 06:40.660
if it is not that it is not truth.

06:41.468 --> 06:45.180
[UNCLEAR You can take] ignorance, we are in the darkness.

06:45.535 --> 06:51.589
If he cannot see, that doesn't
mean that truth doesn't exist.

06:52.795 --> 06:57.508
In these modern times there's so much of confusion,

06:57.708 --> 07:03.180
so much of thoughts, so many of people,

07:03.676 --> 07:08.972
so many cults and gurus and this and that coming up.

07:09.173 --> 07:14.142
So many giving ideas about food, body,

07:14.517 --> 07:18.660
about mind, about health, about spirit.

07:19.075 --> 07:21.757
Everybody is talking about something.

07:21.958 --> 07:26.780
That has created the greatest confusion for honest seeker

07:26.981 --> 07:29.540
and every honest seeker feels

07:29.740 --> 07:35.660
that I should be able to find out

07:36.490 --> 07:39.612
the truth behind everything.

07:41.416 --> 07:45.140
Now, the truth we know about anything,

07:45.509 --> 07:48.884
is actually intelligible to us,

07:50.040 --> 07:53.783
on our central nervous system.

07:54.088 --> 07:59.348
Whether it feels hot or cold,
you can feel it on our fingertips...

07:59.548 --> 08:02.159
...First feel that way

08:02.360 --> 08:07.100
whether we see something white or red,

08:07.300 --> 08:13.525
is intelligible to us on our central nervous system.

08:13.870 --> 08:16.540
So in our evolutionary process

08:16.740 --> 08:22.420
whatever we know through our
central nervous system is our achievement.

08:22.620 --> 08:26.020
We have become human beings now, we have...
