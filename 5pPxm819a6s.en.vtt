00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.999
Today we have decided

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.834
to have a puja of Virata

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.083
in the land of Shri Krishna.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:28.917
As you know, in the growth of Shri Vishnu's manifestation,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.333
He comes into ten incarnations

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:41.125
and ultimately He manifests Himself as Virat.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:58.667
Virat is the brain of the being which can call as God Almighty,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.999
so the whole central nervous system is worked through

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:11.375
by Shri Krishna as Vishnu,

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:14.667
then all this incarnations,

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:20.417
then Shri Krishna and ultimately as Virat.

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:25.125
This is the development of our brain

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:29.709
and when we are worshipping Virat,

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:34.999
we have to know that within us also we have got

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:40.999
the manifestation of this power of Virat.

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.999
That manifestation which we have

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:52.999
we can call it as Virat if Shri Krishna is Mahavirata.

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.417
You all know about Virat

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:59.041
much more than I can tell you today

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:04.125
because It's the whole,

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.208
It's the totality.

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:15.792
And the totality of everything, if that is Virat,

00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:18.999
then that is in your brain,

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:24.999
but reality is in your heart.

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:29.208
So the totality you may see,

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.417
you may witness,

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:36.999
the reality is the subtlety behind it.

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.750
So the brain which is not ruled by the heart,

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.458
which is not nourished by the heart,

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.999
is a very dangerous thing,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.417
because it creates extroversion,

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:54.959
and such a person who is without any heart

00:02:54.999 --> 00:03:00.917
tries to do things, becomes very ruthless

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.458
and can be very dangerous.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:07.834
It could the other way also within us;

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.542
that if we allow our heart to rule us,

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:13.999
only live with our emotions

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.291
and not to use our rationality,

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:22.166
then we can become really very dangerous people to ourselves.

00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:25.500
In the sense, we become lethargic,

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:30.959
we become indulgent into wrong sort of things.

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.667
And today what one feels that in America

00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:36.250
there's more dominance

00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:40.375
of the left side than of the right.

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.583
Right side is our attention

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.999
and the right side of attention is we can say

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:52.000
is the liver of God Almighty.

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:54.917
So now when we have to talk of the totality,

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.250
when we are part and parcel of the totality

00:03:57.375 --> 00:04:02.500
and now we are awakened to that existence of ours

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:05.999
as the part and parcel of the whole,

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.208
then we have to realize to become the whole

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.750
we have to do something about it.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.458
Specially in the land of Shri Krishna

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:16.667
we have to work out this tremendous task

00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:21.208
of creating Viratas out of Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:26.999
After going through the various experiences

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:30.208
of American Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:32.041
I've reached a conclusion

00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.709
that we have to talk more frankly about things

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:37.999
than we have been talking before.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:42.500
Why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:46.999
while there are so many seekers.

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:53.667
The main point is that we do not realize

00:04:53.792 --> 00:05:00.291
that the left side is overpowering this country very much.

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:06.291
There are people who are active,

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.750
but the percentage is very low

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.083
because of too much of affluence,

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:17.792
too much of freedom,

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:22.792
the idea of "what's wrong in anything."

00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:27.083
People are going towards shamelessness,

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:32.667
immoral life, self-indulgent.

00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:36.875
And this self-indulgence, to protect that,

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:40.999
people always develop a kind of a ego

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.917
which has no dynamism in it.

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:51.999
So now the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:54.458
not with Sahaja Yoga as such.

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.999
When you see that the land is not so fertile

00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:00.999
and here you have to work very hard,

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.291
the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:06.625
is to go deep.

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:11.750
You can see wherever the land is not fertile

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:14.667
the trees go very deep down,

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:21.000
they dig very deep into the Mother Earth

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:24.999
for the sap to be sucked in.

00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.959
And the same way they grow very high,

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:35.083
because the strength of their deepening

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:37.667
gives them this great height.

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:39.709
So they grow very tall

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:41.834
and also they are very deep.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:45.166
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America

00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.709
have to work out

00:06:46.834 --> 00:06:49.458
because here it's so much superficiality

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.709
and so much of frivolousness

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:56.208
and also no meaning to their lives.

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:58.291
They have no meanings at all

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:02.041
and they are just frittering away their lives

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:04.999
with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:07.542
and their love and all those things.

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:11.917
So what we need today are Sahaja Yogis who are right-sided,

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:14.999
those who will produce results,

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.999
those who will be dynamic.

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:20.500
They don't have to worry that somebody is right-sided

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:22.250
and he'll become right-sided,

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.542
actually that is what is needed today.

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:27.999
Unless and until you have people who are dynamic

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.083
we cannot work it out.

00:07:30.208 --> 00:07:33.041
It's a reaction in this country as well as in England,

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:35.999
in many countries who dominated other people.

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:38.792
Like you see in this place

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.792
which was actually originally belonged

00:07:41.917 --> 00:07:48.500
to some tribes of Indians

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:52.999
and the English, the Spanish and all these Europeans came,

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:54.999
killed them and occupied here.

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:56.417
It's a highway robbery,

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.041
absolutely highway robbery.

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:04.417
Because of their arrogance and their aggressiveness,

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:07.458
they could not see that they were doing such a horrible thing.

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:10.792
I mean, why call any names of Hitler,

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:12.999
they're even worse than Hitler,

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:15.417
because at least Hitler was taken to task,

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.999
he was condemned and people know that it was a mistake.

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:21.917
But what about those who came all the way from there

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:24.792
and killed so many people here

00:08:24.917 --> 00:08:28.458
and nicely having a very nice time everywhere

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:29.999
as great Americans

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:33.999
and now they are trying to show off everywhere.

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:37.041
Actually it's such a sinful thing that is done

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:39.999
that all these souls which have died

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:41.999
I think have possessed them

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:46.500
and now today America is on the left hand side.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:51.208
The right hand side of Americans is finished now,

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:54.834
they are on the left hand side, guilty,

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:57.834
feeling guilty they are taking to indulgences.

00:08:57.959 --> 00:08:59.999
Once you go to the right side, you see,

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:01.291
you are very disciplined

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:06.542
and you become very ascetic by temperament,

00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:11.291
I should say, and you want to dominate others

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.083
and you want to capture.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:17.999
But today the situation of England and America is just the same.

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.999
In England the same thing I find with Sahaja Yogis

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:23.000
they are just lovey-dovey types, you see,

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:28.834
and all they love Me and love Me and love Me.

00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:31.667
And I just don't understand.

00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:32.999
What's this going on?

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:34.709
They all love Me

00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:36.999
and they'll bring flowers for Me, finished.

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:39.333
Is this the way we are going to work our Sahaja Yoga

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:42.999
in that England and in this America?

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:47.667
"Mother, I love you very much." So what?

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:54.709
So to become one part and parcel of the whole,

00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:57.792
a drop has to become the ocean,

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:00.208
you have to become great people,

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.583
you have to be responsible.

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:06.333
And this lovey-dovey business that you have

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:08.834
has to go out of your mind completely,

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:12.250
otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:16.999
and you'll be cursed one after another.

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:19.417
There are shocks after shocks

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:23.917
that are coming to this country as well as to England.

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:27.000
But people are not learning any lessons from that,

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:29.834
still it is all right;

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:32.291
we get this disease, all right;

00:10:32.417 --> 00:10:33.999
then we glorify it.

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:38.417
If we are suffering from ecological difference,

00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:39.999
still we are glorified.

00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:42.667
If you are using too much of machinery out of balance,

00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:44.333
still we are glorified.

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:48.583
Because they just want self-indulgence.

00:10:48.834 --> 00:10:51.709
Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:55.542
that what is going wrong with this country is that,

00:10:55.667 --> 00:11:00.875
that they do not see anything that is reality.

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:03.667
And the reality, though it is in the heart,

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:05.667
though it works in the heart, it has to act.

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:12.333
This has to act and if it does not act,

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:17.999
this kind of a passive behavior

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:19.583
is not going to help you.

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:21.250
Now at this old age of Mine

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.083
I'm traveling from places to places

00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:26.000
and I'm doing so much.

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:32.333
Now let us think about it: what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:35.458
Those who see you,

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:41.083
see you as sometimes as just some hippies with disheveled hairs

00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:43.999
and something that kind of a thing.

00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:45.999
This is the report I have,

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:48.709
from people who came to your centers and things like that.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:51.333
"Oh, they are a set of hippies, you see," just like that.

00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:53.750
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do,

00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:56.291
has to make up something of his personality,

00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:59.542
in America is very important.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.999
They are studying, they are out of job,

00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:04.999
they are doing this, that.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.500
That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all,

00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:10.500
they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:14.375
If you really want to do something you have to become something.

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:16.667
You have to study, you have to become something,

00:12:16.792 --> 00:12:20.792
you have to have some sort of a degree, diploma, something

00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:23.583
attached to you, you have to mean something.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:27.041
Hippies cannot run Sahaja Yoga in America;

00:12:27.166 --> 00:12:34.500
they may run better in India but not here.

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:36.999
So one has to realize that

00:12:37.041 --> 00:12:38.999
what has gone wrong with us is that

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:43.250
we are now following a very subtle way

00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:48.750
of the same trends that we have taken.

00:12:48.875 --> 00:13:07.959
After Realization, we think that we are realized souls,

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:09.999
that we have become yogis now,

00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:13.709
that we are realized souls.

00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:17.417
But one should see

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:20.083
that we have become realized souls, no doubt,

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:25.999
but whatever bindings we had before coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:30.083
have become subtler.

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:40.500
They have not expressed themselves as lights,

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:45.291
just we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:49.709
We believe that we have vibrations

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:53.709
and also we can feel the vibrations.

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:57.041
But still we have not reached that state

00:13:57.166 --> 00:14:02.333
where we have become the totality.

00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:05.667
We have to still grow.

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:08.917
And if you are settled down with your vibrations

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:11.083
and thinking that you are all right,

00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:13.834
you are sadly mistaken.

00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:18.083
Whatever were our conditionings before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:22.083
say you were a hippie,

00:14:22.208 --> 00:14:25.041
so the enlightenment has come,

00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:29.999
but then the idea of this love business is there.

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:32.959
Supposing you were a business man,

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:35.166
so the enlightenment has come to you

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:39.208
and you think that Mother should help you in your business,

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:41.041
that's what it is.

00:14:41.166 --> 00:14:43.999
Supposing now if you were unmarried

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.792
and you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:48.917
then you want that your marriage should be successful

00:14:48.999 --> 00:14:51.041
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:57.999
If there has been a problem in your health or something like that,

00:14:57.999 --> 00:15:01.291
then you have become a subtler person that you think,

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:06.291
"I asked help from Mother for that."

00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:12.709
But we do not think that what have we contributed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:17.875
We had certain things

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:23.333
which we thought were wrong - maybe that,

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:23.834
but in Sahaja Yoga we do not see those things are with us,

00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:29.542
still continuing with us.

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:33.999
To become Virata we have to really examine ourselves,

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:38.500
without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:42.000
I know people who are small-minded,

00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:47.291
who have jealousies and their jealousies continue.

00:15:47.417 --> 00:15:50.709
Supposing there's a good musician,

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:55.166
they'll not appreciate if the other person is a musician,

00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:57.500
he will not appreciate,

00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:00.750
he will not encourage that person that,

00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:05.542
"Really I am a musician, he's also a musician, let me help him."

00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:11.792
So the small-mindedness that existed before

00:16:11.917 --> 00:16:14.999
still becomes in a glorified way.

00:16:15.083 --> 00:16:16.999
The person will think that

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:20.083
"All right, I am a musician and I sing very well

00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:22.999
and I am singing Mother's praise."

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:25.458
But anybody else who's singing

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:29.709
will not be appreciated

00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:32.542
to that extent as you should expect

00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:38.625
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:41.999
This hand, if it feels hurt,

00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:47.166
the another hand immediately helps it.

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:56.333
In the whole body you see the system is so totally connected.

00:16:56.458 --> 00:17:02.458
As soon as you eat food, the digestive system starts working.

00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:04.917
But we should watch ourselves.

00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:06.166
If you have to become deeper,

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.083
we have to watch ourselves where are we lacking.

00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:10.999
Now how does a tree grow?

00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:12.333
I have told you many times the story

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:15.291
that there's a little cell at the end of the root

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:17.458
and it knows,

00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:21.542
and it knows one purpose: that it has to become a tree,

00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:23.000
so it goes round.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:26.583
It sees a boulder or something, stone, goes round it,

00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:28.083
doesn't fight it.

00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:32.083
Because ultimately what we have to achieve

00:17:32.542 --> 00:17:35.083
is to become the tree,

00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:38.125
so we have to keep that in view,

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:41.041
that we have to become the tree

00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:44.917
and not some sort of a small little frog here and there

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:47.417
croaking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:51.625
No, that's not going to work out!

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:53.999
And this is what I find

00:17:54.041 --> 00:18:00.083
also very true about people in, say, England, same thing.

00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:01.417
The leaders are fighting,

00:18:01.542 --> 00:18:04.500
the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.291
how to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis,

00:18:07.417 --> 00:18:08.834
but it's the Sahaja Yogis

00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:11.583
who have to know that the responsibility is theirs.

00:18:11.709 --> 00:18:18.250
They have to grow, they have to become Viratas.

00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:19.999
And this is America

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:22.999
where I told you is the place of Shri Krishna,

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:26.041
where Shri Krishna became the Virat.

00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:34.083
Unless and until you see for yourself

00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:39.417
that we have to do this, we have to become this,

00:18:39.542 --> 00:18:44.041
you are still busy with our little, little silly problems.

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:45.917
It's a vicious circle,

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.999
as soon as you start worrying about your silly problems

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:54.417
and your old stuffs still becoming glorified in Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:54.875 --> 00:19:00.709
then you find the vicious circle starts working,

00:19:01.083 --> 00:19:04.792
it doesn't achieve anything,

00:19:04.917 --> 00:19:07.083
it doesn't give you good chances,

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:11.542
it doesn't give you confidence.

00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:16.709
It's such a thing, it's like a packaging as they call it.

00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:21.417
But as soon as you decide, "No, I am going to do it,"

00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:23.458
you people are Sahaja Yogis,

00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:26.583
you know all about Kundalini,

00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:28.999
you know all about awakening,

00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:34.458
you know all about higher stages of attainment,

00:19:34.583 --> 00:19:39.999
you all, everyone is capable of giving Realization to people.

00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:42.999
You know where the thing is stuck,

00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:48.999
everything you know, but now just think about it,

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:57.291
how many of you have been able to do something about it?

00:19:57.417 --> 00:20:03.250
When people see you their idea about you is very poor.

00:20:03.375 --> 00:20:08.041
They think that you are stuck up with your wives,

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.667
so the wife is very dominating,

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:12.750
so this is happening.

00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:14.500
Suddenly you go off,

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:17.250
you see your child, worried about this one, you ...

00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:21.041
Sometimes I am surprised that once they are married,

00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:22.999
they have a child,

00:20:22.999 --> 00:20:27.208
then they become nothing but the parents of the child, finished,

00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:29.417
Sahaja Yoga is finished.

00:20:29.542 --> 00:20:31.999
Then the child becomes important.

00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:38.542
The blessings become the bindings.

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:43.083
So you have to watch within yourself

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:47.375
that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.

00:20:47.792 --> 00:20:49.417
But in the subtle way

00:20:49.542 --> 00:20:52.083
all these things go on binding

00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:54.166
you and you are attached to it

00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:57.999
and you don't know how they are still tagging you down,

00:20:58.041 --> 00:20:59.792
don't allow you to fly,

00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:01.291
they don't give you the freedom

00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:06.083
that is your own right to have it.

00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:08.999
So even if I make a aeroplane,

00:21:08.999 --> 00:21:11.458
I do everything, put the fuel into it,

00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:17.166
I say everything, but doesn't want to fly.

00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:19.792
Now what do you do with such an aeroplane

00:21:19.917 --> 00:21:22.709
which doesn't want to fly?

00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:25.834
This sort of a situation is there

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:29.208
and this situation makes you so limited

00:21:29.542 --> 00:21:33.999
and so dwarfy. How will you grow?

00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:38.333
Unless and until you grow and you show that

00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:39.999
in your day to day life

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:42.792
into your personality, into everything,

00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:46.250
I assure you nobody is going to be impressed by you.

00:21:46.375 --> 00:21:51.166
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement,

00:21:51.291 --> 00:21:53.834
nor by My photographs,

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:58.291
it's going to work by your work, by your responsibility,

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.834
by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:05.792
it's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it.

00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:09.083
But first of all your shoulders should be strong.

00:22:09.208 --> 00:22:11.458
You are still out of job,

00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:14.709
you are still something, somebody hanging in the air,

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:18.959
you are still somebody who'll not even look at you.

00:22:18.999 --> 00:22:23.458
Then how can you carry on your shoulders?

00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:29.792
So first thing is to build yourself inside

00:22:29.917 --> 00:22:31.834
as well as outside,

00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:33.709
but such a vicious circle I tell you.

00:22:33.834 --> 00:22:35.999
If you do not go deep into yourself,

00:22:35.999 --> 00:22:38.792
you cannot also get the outside thing,

00:22:38.917 --> 00:22:40.333
so it works hand in hand,

00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:42.999
as soon as you start building yourself inside,

00:22:43.083 --> 00:22:46.041
you'll be amazed how things will work out,

00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:49.834
how you'll become dynamic, how you'll become great.

00:22:49.959 --> 00:22:51.417
But you get involved into things

00:22:51.542 --> 00:22:55.166
which are very small and transitory.

00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:59.542
So as I told you before, we are seeking the eternal.

00:22:59.667 --> 00:23:02.208
So the transitory things are to be only used

00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:07.375
very temporarily, what we need is not so important.

00:23:07.709 --> 00:23:11.291
If you can understand this thing clearly,

00:23:11.417 --> 00:23:17.417
that we still are not free, not detached

00:23:17.542 --> 00:23:22.999
from all the things we had before Sahaja Yoga

00:23:23.083 --> 00:23:26.166
and they have become subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:31.500
We are still only using Sahaja Yoga for that purpose

00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:37.542
and not for spreading the light.

00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:46.417
So what's going to happen?

00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:50.500
This is absolutely,

00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:56.166
absolutely to be really to be understood within yourself.

00:23:56.291 --> 00:24:00.417
Sometimes My lectures, you see, are little harsh,

00:24:00.542 --> 00:24:04.417
people think that Mother had to say these things,

00:24:04.542 --> 00:24:07.500
this is also out of My love for you

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.333
and out of My love for this country.

00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:15.999
You have to really see to yourself,

00:24:16.083 --> 00:24:23.999
"What are we? Where are we?"

00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:31.166
We are not going to end up because Sahaja Yogis we had

00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:39.625
were subnormal people in the society.

00:24:39.999 --> 00:24:42.999
If you see the gurus how they spread themselves,

00:24:42.999 --> 00:24:45.333
though they are false, they are useless

00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:49.166
but everybody knows about somebody who comes up. In two months time

00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:52.917
all over the world you can hear about that person.

00:24:52.999 --> 00:24:53.999
What they do,

00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:57.542
they go and first of all see the people who are successful,

00:24:57.667 --> 00:25:00.333
who are prominent in the city.

00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:03.417
They never bother about people who are drug addicts,

00:25:03.667 --> 00:25:06.834
or who are suffering from diseases, no nothing doing,

00:25:06.959 --> 00:25:10.291
they have no business with them.

00:25:10.417 --> 00:25:12.792
They'll just attack the people

00:25:12.917 --> 00:25:16.792
who are very successful, who are very rich,

00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:20.291
because they are on top of the society,

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:22.166
so they'll go and meet people

00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:25.291
and make contacts with them and ask them and this and that

00:25:25.417 --> 00:25:27.999
and then they call them for the program,

00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:29.999
give them all the importance, everything,

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:31.208
then people start thinking,

00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:34.667
"Oh God! What a great thing it is to be here."

00:25:34.792 --> 00:25:38.709
Then pamper their ego a little bit, this and that's how they spread.

00:25:38.834 --> 00:25:41.667
But there's no reality in it, there's nothing,

00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:42.999
nothing special about it,

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:46.333
it's all useless, it's all artificial.

00:25:46.458 --> 00:25:48.999
But that is how they sell themselves.

00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:50.959
Though we do not want to sell ourselves,

00:25:50.999 --> 00:25:52.458
we have to know that

00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:56.999
unless and until we have some remarkable qualities,

00:25:57.208 --> 00:25:59.999
people are not going to look at us,

00:25:59.999 --> 00:26:02.625
because whatever has happened is within ourselves,

00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:05.041
and nobody sees the light,

00:26:05.166 --> 00:26:10.999
it's like a light which is burning, which is covered completely.

00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:14.417
So I've seen that

00:26:14.542 --> 00:26:17.999
I went to Columbia. In Columbia, you'll be amazed

00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:20.208
that people had never known Me,

00:26:20.458 --> 00:26:21.999
they had never heard My name,

00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:25.083
but I don't know why but

00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:29.625
the crowds were so much that I couldn't enter into the compound

00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:32.667
and with somehow or other I was pushed into it.

00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:35.125
Then in the hall was impossible,

00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:37.999
people were hanging on the â€“

00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:39.792
I thought they were hanging

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:41.917
from the top, just sitting on the thing to watch Me over.

00:26:41.999 --> 00:26:44.999
So many people in every direction, in every height

00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:49.333
I found people there, I did not know how to settle them down.

00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:51.834
But they listened to Me very carefully this thing,

00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:55.417
two days we had the programmed, two days the crowds were there.

00:26:55.542 --> 00:26:58.959
And then when they had to follow-on they came,

00:26:58.999 --> 00:27:02.083
next day they disappeared.

00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:03.792
Same thing in Greece,

00:27:03.917 --> 00:27:05.999
same thing in Turkey.

00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:13.667
So there's definitely something wrong with us.

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:16.291
Now there's a course coming up,

00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:18.208
people are trying to do the course business,

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:23.542
but one should know it is not knowledge without love,

00:27:23.667 --> 00:27:25.333
it is love and knowledge.

00:27:25.458 --> 00:27:26.999
So how you talk to them,

00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:30.125
how you deal with them is there,

00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:33.625
but your dynamism is going to impress them.

00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:36.291
You can see the film we saw yesterday

00:27:36.583 --> 00:27:39.458
in which the music was there. Now what was it?

00:27:39.709 --> 00:27:41.999
There the energy was dynamic,

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:46.166
the energy was dynamic, with the music and everything

00:27:46.417 --> 00:27:47.667
and that was showing.

00:27:47.792 --> 00:27:50.166
So you see you got engrossed into it,

00:27:50.417 --> 00:27:53.125
so the movement of that energy, the dynamism of that energy

00:27:53.542 --> 00:27:55.999
really got you engrossed.

00:27:57.999 --> 00:28:01.999
But to be afraid that you'll become right-sided is nonsensical,

00:28:01.999 --> 00:28:09.375
now you are in the center, how can you become right-sided?

00:28:12.917 --> 00:28:18.750
This kind of argument is only to support lethargy,

00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:21.417
then not to have any discipline.

00:28:21.709 --> 00:28:24.417
I was surprised that in Shudy Camp,

00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:29.166
where we have established a school for meditation,

00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.000
people come every week-end just to spend the week-end,

00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:35.458
they get up at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:37.041
whenever they feel like,

00:28:37.166 --> 00:28:39.999
they are on holidays in Shudy Camp.

00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:44.959
And two days they'll stay there without any meditation,

00:28:44.999 --> 00:28:46.458
without anything.

00:28:46.583 --> 00:28:48.166
We have come to Mother's house, finished.

00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:52.709
Mother has to do all the job for them.

00:28:53.417 --> 00:28:56.667
I mean, for a Sahaja Yogi it is minimum of minimum

00:28:56.792 --> 00:28:58.417
that they should get up early in the morning,

00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:01.041
have their bath and sit down for pujas.

00:29:01.166 --> 00:29:05.041
Is a common thing, all Indians do that way,

00:29:05.542 --> 00:29:07.417
It's a practice.

00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:09.458
Suddenly this country

00:29:09.709 --> 00:29:13.291
or these countries have gone into a kind of a lethargic

00:29:13.417 --> 00:29:14.500
nonsensical life,

00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:18.959
otherwise this country also used to do the same thing.

00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:25.333
And sleeping also: you have to sleep early if you want to,

00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:30.999
but one has to think that we have to change our lifestyle,

00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:33.999
we have to change our attitudes,

00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:38.583
so many things, see, like I said simple things, like I said,

00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:40.959
"The day you want to wash your hair,

00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:45.667
put lot of oil in your hair and then wash. We'll become bald."

00:29:45.792 --> 00:29:50.999
Imagine all bald Sahaja Yogis walking.

00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:56.999
They'll think your Mother has so many hair and what about your hair.

00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:02.667
In food also, too much, like

00:30:02.792 --> 00:30:05.625
I don't know here what is the situation, but in England I find

00:30:05.875 --> 00:30:07.999
they take so much of tea,

00:30:08.041 --> 00:30:11.999
all the time the tea is - the kettle is on the thing.

00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:14.709
I mean people are amazed

00:30:14.834 --> 00:30:18.083
when they, people come to Ganapatipule also in India,

00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:20.999
we don't take tea so many times,

00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:22.999
I mean twice at the most.

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:24.999
The whole day people want tea there,

00:30:24.999 --> 00:30:26.166
they don't understand

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:31.959
how can they go on drinking tea at one o'clock in the night.

00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:42.166
It's like the alcohol has become subtler: tea ,

00:30:42.291 --> 00:30:45.999
otherwise how do you explain?

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:48.999
You can't take alcohol, so let's have tea,

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:52.208
then settle down nicely, we are having cup-o-tea,

00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:53.999
in England very common:

00:30:53.999 --> 00:30:57.333
sit down nicely, cup-o-tea.

00:30:57.458 --> 00:31:02.959
What work have you done that you are settling down like that?

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:07.792
Then whenever they'll come, "Haaa,"

00:31:07.917 --> 00:31:10.083
as if they have dug up something,

00:31:10.208 --> 00:31:15.333
or they have done the English Channel,

00:31:15.458 --> 00:31:17.999
they'll come, even on the television you'll see people,

00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:21.500
they come down, "Haa."

00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:23.458
I don't understand.

00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:26.500
You'll never find any Indian doing that,

00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:29.667
after all in that heat also, he'll never say that,

00:31:29.792 --> 00:31:33.083
because you think, think, think too much, just think,

00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:36.417
don't do anything about it.

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:39.999
Like you file, you see, make a file,

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:41.917
tomorrow is Mother's puja, all right,

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:43.999
we'll have this, this, this - filed it.

00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:48.875
At the puja it is not there, why? It's in the file.

00:31:52.166 --> 00:32:00.999
And anything that is before your Realization,

00:32:00.999 --> 00:32:06.417
like people have an idea,

00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:10.999
Labor saving is a very great asset of the Western people.

00:32:06.542 --> 00:32:06.542
like this how to avoid work, you see, labor saving.

00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:12.667
So the labor saving how they will do.

00:32:12.792 --> 00:32:14.999
Supposing, you say, "Please, telephone to such a person."

00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:17.458
"Mother, I think he may not be there."

00:32:17.583 --> 00:32:21.166
"Baba, you telephone and find out."

00:32:21.917 --> 00:32:24.999
So the explanation comes from the brain,

00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:29.500
it may not. So nothing can be achieved.

00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:31.999
So first the labor saving was that

00:32:31.999 --> 00:32:36.250
"Oh, this is anti-culture, we should be â€“

00:32:36.375 --> 00:32:38.500
this is so bad, everything is so bad,

00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.250
we should start a very natural life,

00:32:41.375 --> 00:32:44.208
we should lead a very natural thing and that

00:32:44.333 --> 00:32:47.959
we should become primitive," and all that.

00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:53.999
From that if you grow in - from that area if you grow into Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:54.083 --> 00:32:56.291
you become subtler.

00:32:57.208 --> 00:33:01.542
So the subtler things that they become is this way:

00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:05.999
that now as it is, you see,

00:33:06.834 --> 00:33:11.500
"We should not do too much of everything, is too much, you see,

00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:13.625
it is too much."

00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:17.583
If you talk to somebody about Sahaja Yoga, they say,

00:33:17.999 --> 00:33:19.999
"It's too much for me."

00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:22.208
Hey, you have no brain or what is it?

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:25.792
What is too much? Can't take it?

00:33:25.917 --> 00:33:28.000
"Oh it's too much."

00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:31.667
It's a very common experience with Me,

00:33:31.792 --> 00:33:35.083
that when I talk to people they would say, "It's too much."

00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:38.667
I mean your brain, is it a limited brain

00:33:38.792 --> 00:33:44.083
or what is it that you can't listen to Me what I am trying to tell you?

00:33:44.208 --> 00:33:48.542
And once you start developing this kind of attitude,

00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:50.667
the nourishment cannot reach you,

00:33:50.792 --> 00:33:53.999
supposing the trees say, "Oh it's too much,"

00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:58.083
then what are they going to do?

00:34:00.083 --> 00:34:02.667
Nothing is too much.

00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:05.667
"I have to grow, I have to take all the nourishment,

00:34:05.792 --> 00:34:08.834
I have to become something,

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:11.999
I have to do such a lot.

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:12.999
What have I done?"

00:34:13.041 --> 00:34:18.542
Nothing so far. Never be satisfied with yourself.

00:34:18.667 --> 00:34:21.542
I mean, some people who saw My program

00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:24.458
they were all shocked how Mother is going to do it.

00:34:24.583 --> 00:34:30.083
I said, "I know I am going to do it, if I have to do it, I'll do it."

00:34:35.125 --> 00:34:37.291
So this is what should be attitude:

00:34:37.417 --> 00:34:44.458
when you love Me I am your ideal. You must know that.

00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:48.917
If you love Me, then what are you doing about it?

00:34:48.999 --> 00:35:01.458
I am your ideal. You have to reach My style,

00:35:04.083 --> 00:35:07.750
otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out in these countries

00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:14.417
which have taken to lethargy as a great culture.

00:35:14.792 --> 00:35:17.083
I asked somebody, "What about your bathing,

00:35:17.208 --> 00:35:18.500
why didn't you take bath?"

00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:23.166
He said, "These days it is out of fashion to take bath."

00:35:23.792 --> 00:35:29.166
Everything seems to be out of fashion, whatever is in fashion is horrid.

00:35:29.709 --> 00:35:32.250
"It's very fashionable," is another thing people say,

00:35:32.375 --> 00:35:34.417
"it's very fashionable,"

00:35:34.542 --> 00:35:38.333
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

00:35:40.083 --> 00:35:43.083
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

00:35:43.333 --> 00:35:47.166
you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life.

00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:49.583
We have to have education, we have to have a place,

00:35:49.709 --> 00:35:54.166
we have to have a position in the society.

00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:56.959
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

00:35:56.999 --> 00:36:00.999
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there

00:36:00.999 --> 00:36:06.667
and just doing our Tapasya.

00:36:06.792 --> 00:36:14.792
Tapasya is here where you live.

00:36:14.917 --> 00:36:18.959
Otherwise if you say that "All right we have to go to Himalayas

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:22.709
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

00:36:22.834 --> 00:36:24.458
Oh, that's very good."

00:36:24.583 --> 00:36:26.583
Because that looks like something, you see,

00:36:26.709 --> 00:36:29.750
you might have a name, or something like that.

00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:31.792
But Tapasya is here,

00:36:31.917 --> 00:36:34.333
the detachment has to be worked out here.

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:37.417
You get involved into all these things,

00:36:37.542 --> 00:36:40.250
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

00:36:40.375 --> 00:36:43.500
the amount of involvement you have

00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:50.709
in the things which existed in gross form,

00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:54.208
they have become subtler and you are still bound by them,

00:36:54.333 --> 00:36:58.999
there's no freedom.

00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:05.999
And that's why when you see something absurd happening,

00:37:05.999 --> 00:37:08.792
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:08.917 --> 00:37:12.667
it's just the symptom of that thing becoming subtler

00:37:12.792 --> 00:37:17.999
within us and its expressing itself.

00:37:18.834 --> 00:37:20.917
Like sometimes you may not see fire

00:37:20.999 --> 00:37:27.999
but it exists and suddenly you find a blast.

00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:34.834
So transformation of course means evolution,

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:35.999
it also means that whatever basis you had,

00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:37.999
you have to evolve out of it.

00:37:37.999 --> 00:37:46.834
Like a flower blossoming and then becoming the fruit,

00:37:46.959 --> 00:37:52.291
but it has to drop out many things.

00:37:53.999 --> 00:37:59.999
And then with the nature one has to see such a unison.

00:38:01.917 --> 00:38:08.208
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

00:38:08.333 --> 00:38:13.709
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

00:38:13.834 --> 00:38:22.999
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

00:38:22.999 --> 00:38:25.542
because the leaves drop out.

00:38:25.667 --> 00:38:32.542
In the winter time they nourish the tree with their nitrogen;

00:38:32.667 --> 00:38:34.999
when the time is ready,

00:38:34.999 --> 00:38:41.999
then these clouds pour down and again nourish this.

00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:47.417
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

00:38:47.542 --> 00:38:51.583
If it was not, I tell you they would, we would, have said,

00:38:51.709 --> 00:38:56.291
"all bald headed lands here."

00:38:57.208 --> 00:39:02.250
If you go to any, any forest, any forest, it's so clean,

00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:06.709
you never have any bad smell anywhere whatsoever.

00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:09.999
There are animals, there are tigers, that, this â€“

00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:12.709
never get any smell anywhere,

00:39:12.834 --> 00:39:14.500
you never even get the smell of a tiger.

00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:19.834
But if you put the tiger in a cage then he starts smelling,

00:39:19.959 --> 00:39:23.250
he's so much bathed in the nature, he lives with the nature,

00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:27.291
and in such balance.

00:39:27.417 --> 00:39:30.792
It's such an understanding among all the animals, everything.

00:39:30.917 --> 00:39:34.667
I don't know how they keep it so clean,

00:39:34.792 --> 00:39:38.500
but as soon as you get some smell,

00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:44.999
you will find out there must be some human being somewhere,

00:39:45.417 --> 00:39:49.667
or some untidiness.

00:39:49.792 --> 00:39:54.583
It's so organized how the leaves grow according to the sun's rays,

00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:56.333
how they organize themselves,

00:39:56.458 --> 00:40:00.959
how they build up themselves.

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:04.834
So if you really have to get to the nature of Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:04.959 --> 00:40:09.417
we should get all these blessings

00:40:09.542 --> 00:40:12.250
by which we should prosper.

00:40:12.375 --> 00:40:19.208
Not, I mean in money and things, but in every way.

00:40:19.625 --> 00:40:25.834
So it should not be a set of people who are just sort of parasites.

00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:34.500
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today

00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:37.999
and I request you, all of you,

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:41.000
to be alert and dynamic

00:40:41.125 --> 00:40:43.291
and work it out.

00:40:43.417 --> 00:40:45.583
Each single person has to come up.

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:49.041
It's not going to work out if you wear some saffron clothes

00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:52.083
and go on singing "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" on the street.

00:40:52.208 --> 00:40:58.333
No. It's not going to work out.

00:40:58.458 --> 00:41:00.500
Nor it is going to work out if you say,

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.999
"We are Sahaja Yogis, we are such people and this and that."

00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:08.750
Nothing. You have to be something.

00:41:08.875 --> 00:41:13.208
So on one side, the dynamism is to be used for yourself

00:41:13.333 --> 00:41:18.999
and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:24.542
You need not now worry about right-sidedness.

00:41:24.875 --> 00:41:26.999
Is very common even in ...

00:41:26.999 --> 00:41:29.834
This happened: I found in Holland

00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:34.999
that I married one girl, very dynamic girl, to someone

00:41:35.041 --> 00:41:38.500
and the husband said, "Mother, she doesn't help me."

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:39.999
I said, "Why?"

00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:42.999
"Because I'm afraid I'll become right-sided."

00:41:42.999 --> 00:41:47.166
I said, "But why did I marry you to this left-sided fellow?

00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:49.792
That you become left-sided?"

00:41:49.917 --> 00:41:51.667
Left-sided is a very good thing

00:41:51.792 --> 00:41:54.542
because you don't have to do anything, just you have to say,

00:41:54.667 --> 00:42:03.709
"I don't want to become right-sided," that's all.

00:42:03.834 --> 00:42:06.750
But right-sidedness means you have to look,

00:42:06.875 --> 00:42:09.834
you have to be alert, you have to be clever

00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:14.999
and you have to know everything.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:18.083
You'll sit in the sun, burn your skins,

00:42:18.208 --> 00:42:20.667
but look at the sun.

00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:27.917
Are you on the sun line or on the moon line?

00:42:27.999 --> 00:42:33.999
So the swing of all the Western people is on the left hand side.

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:43.917
Drinking, pubs, like in 24 hours they sleep,

00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:45.583
say maybe fourteen hours,

00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:45.709
maybe eighteen hours,

00:42:46.999 --> 00:42:51.041
rest of the time they drink, that's all.

00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:55.458
We have one house being built next to us,

00:42:55.834 --> 00:42:57.166
when we shifted there, they said,

00:42:57.291 --> 00:43:00.041
"This is practically finished now" - still finishing

00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:02.333
and will take at least three years more maybe,

00:43:02.458 --> 00:43:03.999
may never finish.

00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:07.458
It's like the mathematics, you see, you have this

00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:10.999
that there was a work and somebody came,

00:43:11.083 --> 00:43:13.500
he did one tenth and ran away.

00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:16.208
Then somebody came did one twentieth and ran away.

00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:18.750
Then somebody came he did one fortieth and ran away.

00:43:18.875 --> 00:43:20.999
When will the work finish? It will never finish,

00:43:20.999 --> 00:43:24.999
with such running away people, never finish.

00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:27.166
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:28.834
If you put mathematically,

00:43:28.959 --> 00:43:31.166
Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America,

00:43:31.291 --> 00:43:38.500
if you add up more and more of this kind of people.

00:43:38.625 --> 00:43:40.834
So much is happening in this country,

00:43:40.959 --> 00:43:42.583
but you have to see those people, you have to meet those people

00:43:42.709 --> 00:43:47.834
who are at the helm of affairs, who are the people who matter,

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:52.458
who are scientific, who are talking about something sensible.

00:43:52.583 --> 00:43:57.041
You have to talk to them, get to them.

00:43:59.417 --> 00:44:02.000
We don't need cinema actors and actresses,

00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:05.834
but we need people who are dynamic.

00:44:05.959 --> 00:44:07.583
And this may work out

00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:11.875
if you put your minds to it and we have something to show them.

00:44:14.792 --> 00:44:16.709
I would say that Austria is one place

00:44:16.834 --> 00:44:18.750
where Sahaja Yoga has worked very well,

00:44:18.875 --> 00:44:24.208
Milan is another place and where most of them are professionals.

00:44:25.375 --> 00:44:29.999
It's very surprising, in modern times we are living.

00:44:30.083 --> 00:44:32.291
We are not living in those ancient times

00:44:32.417 --> 00:44:36.500
where the Rishi Munis used to sit under a tree

00:44:36.625 --> 00:44:41.500
and the kings used to come and touch their feet.

00:44:41.625 --> 00:44:43.166
Is the other way round;

00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:49.999
the Rishi Munis have to go and talk to the kings.

00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:54.583
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis

00:44:54.709 --> 00:44:56.667
we have to know that in a subtle way

00:44:56.792 --> 00:44:58.542
we are still caught up into the webs of

00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:03.999
our own understanding about life. So, that we have to change.

00:45:03.999 --> 00:45:07.709
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga

00:45:07.834 --> 00:45:17.625
and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others.

00:45:18.709 --> 00:45:22.999
So I hope you will listen to My lecture today,

00:45:22.999 --> 00:45:25.999
you will take the tapes home and listen to them

00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:27.709
again and again.

00:45:27.834 --> 00:45:30.667
Also there's a warning from people that

00:45:30.792 --> 00:45:37.959
"Mother, what they do is to take one tape for one center

00:45:37.999 --> 00:45:40.999
and everybody listens it and then finished."

00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:46.792
Meaning, you all should have one tape each.

00:45:46.917 --> 00:45:49.291
Even that, people don't do.

00:45:49.417 --> 00:45:51.999
Not only that, but now it might be after some time

00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:58.999
only one, one tape in circulation in one country.

00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:02.709
They circulate; say, today in New York, tomorrow in Boston,

00:46:02.834 --> 00:46:07.500
like that. You have to listen to it again and again.

00:46:07.625 --> 00:46:09.999
Sit down with your paper and pencil,

00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:11.999
see for yourself what I am saying.

00:46:12.083 --> 00:46:14.750
Every tape should be with you.

00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:16.999
I mean, these horrible gurus' tapes

00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:21.000
you can hear them in every car, in every place,

00:46:21.125 --> 00:46:23.999
everyone they have it.

00:46:24.041 --> 00:46:28.959
And why is it Sahaja Yogis don't have any tapes with them?

00:46:28.999 --> 00:46:32.999
You can make copies.

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:37.917
But if you can get it free, they'll like to have.

00:46:37.999 --> 00:46:44.333
That's the first thing, what we can get free, cheaply, easily.

00:46:44.458 --> 00:46:50.792
If you try to save money, the money tries to save itself.

00:46:50.917 --> 00:46:57.458
It's a mutual understanding.

00:47:00.667 --> 00:47:04.000
It's as simple as this: supposing you open only one door,

00:47:04.125 --> 00:47:05.208
no air will come in.

00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:08.083
You open the other door the air will start flowing.

00:47:08.208 --> 00:47:12.625
It's a circulation.

00:47:14.166 --> 00:47:16.750
All this can be your own knowledge too,

00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:19.959
I need not say anything, this is all in your brains,

00:47:19.999 --> 00:47:23.000
only open out yourself, you are not free people.

00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:24.750
If you are free like Me,

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:30.333
you'll see all these things coming from your own brains.

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:35.250
Specially for America, really, as you know, I am working very hard

00:47:35.375 --> 00:47:38.041
and I want to work it out because,

00:47:38.166 --> 00:47:41.542
if America is not all right, My Vishuddhi is not going to be all right.

00:47:41.667 --> 00:47:45.999
It's going to trouble Me throughout.

00:47:46.083 --> 00:47:51.208
So you have to take it up upon yourself.

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:57.417
I don't say, "Take the cross."

00:47:57.542 --> 00:48:00.208
You don't have to sacrifice anything,

00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:07.417
but you have to be just aware about what are we,

00:48:07.542 --> 00:48:11.041
what are we doing, where are we?

00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:13.583
And on top of that,

00:48:13.709 --> 00:48:19.542
Sahaja Yogis think they are obliging Sahaja Yoga and Me too.

00:48:19.999 --> 00:48:24.917
This is something. It's to be explained this way:

00:48:24.999 --> 00:48:27.542
I don't need Sahaja Yoga, you need Sahaja Yoga

00:48:27.667 --> 00:48:29.917
and everybody needs Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:29.999 --> 00:48:32.208
You had in this country people like,

00:48:32.333 --> 00:48:34.750
I mean such great, great people you had

00:48:34.875 --> 00:48:38.208
I need not mention - persons like Abraham Lincoln

00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:44.458
who gave such great ideas to the whole world.

00:48:45.709 --> 00:48:48.041
Why not you people be great?

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:49.999
He was a realized soul, all right,

00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:57.000
but he didn't know anything about Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

00:48:57.125 --> 00:49:01.917
Why can't you become great like him?

00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:09.667
So on a Virata Puja we have to decide

00:49:09.917 --> 00:49:12.999
that we are all going to express

00:49:12.999 --> 00:49:18.542
the conception that was once the Virat

00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:20.999
as reality in our lives.

00:49:21.083 --> 00:49:27.999
This is what we have to pray from our heart.

00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:32.667
And it's a very good occasion today to do that,

00:49:32.792 --> 00:49:36.542
because we are sitting in a place where there were

00:49:36.667 --> 00:49:43.333
so many of these aboriginal people, you call them, anything.

00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:46.917
They were so sensible,

00:49:46.999 --> 00:49:50.709
as in America you say brass tacks, you see.

00:49:50.834 --> 00:49:58.999
They knew the principle how to lead a real spiritual life.

00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:03.542
They were very free people, extremely free

00:50:03.999 --> 00:50:07.667
and so detached.

00:50:07.792 --> 00:50:09.999
So if you do not correct yourself,

00:50:10.083 --> 00:50:12.333
then there will be a problem on collectivity.

00:50:12.458 --> 00:50:14.000
If there's a problem in collectivity,

00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:16.583
it will reflect on you,

00:50:16.709 --> 00:50:19.750
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

00:50:19.875 --> 00:50:22.709
If there's a problem in the whole being

00:50:22.834 --> 00:50:24.542
there's a problem for you.

00:50:24.667 --> 00:50:26.417
And if there's a problem in one part,

00:50:26.542 --> 00:50:28.834
there's a problem for the whole being.

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:32.000
Even Roosevelt who was your president once said that

00:50:32.125 --> 00:50:35.667
"Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

00:50:35.792 --> 00:50:40.166
He could see this point so clearly.

00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:42.458
You see, all these sayings show us

00:50:42.583 --> 00:50:45.417
that this is a country of Virat,

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:46.999
where they talk of collectivity,

00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:50.917
they have all the communications

00:50:50.999 --> 00:50:52.792
which are important.

00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:54.999
Every sort of communication is important,

00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:56.208
but for Sahaja Yogis

00:50:56.333 --> 00:50:59.834
it has to be very subtle, very dynamic,

00:50:59.959 --> 00:51:01.917
very beautiful, very loving,

00:51:01.999 --> 00:51:06.208
very impressive, magnetic.

00:51:06.333 --> 00:51:10.709
Then only the communications will work.

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:14.999
There's no harm in wearing very nice dresses.

00:51:14.999 --> 00:51:20.208
There's no harm in wearing - nice doesn't mean expensive,

00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:27.999
but means which are sensible, dignified.

00:51:27.999 --> 00:51:31.458
We have to build up our personalities,

00:51:31.583 --> 00:51:40.333
that people should feel that "Oh, this is something, eh."

00:51:40.458 --> 00:51:46.291
And your children will also learn from you.

00:51:46.417 --> 00:51:49.083
There's no question of feeling that

00:51:49.208 --> 00:51:49.792
you'll be driven into ego or anything,

00:51:49.999 --> 00:51:58.041
that's finished now, ego is finished here, there's no ego.

00:51:58.166 --> 00:52:02.750
What I find here is a justification

00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:04.000
for doing nothing

00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:11.709
that we do not want to do anything because our ego will come up.

00:52:11.834 --> 00:52:18.667
Very clever.

00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:25.542
So with all this one has to know

00:52:25.667 --> 00:52:28.291
that we are selected people,

00:52:28.417 --> 00:52:31.709
we are chosen people of God.

00:52:31.834 --> 00:52:34.000
He must have selected us with some purpose,

00:52:34.125 --> 00:52:37.709
otherwise there are so many people in this country.

00:52:37.834 --> 00:52:41.709
You are the foundation and you have to be solid people

00:52:41.834 --> 00:52:43.999
to be the foundation.

00:52:45.166 --> 00:52:47.750
Must know our own glory,

00:52:47.875 --> 00:52:50.959
our own speciality

00:52:50.999 --> 00:52:53.542
that why we are selected,

00:52:53.667 --> 00:52:56.500
of all the people why are we there?

00:52:56.625 --> 00:53:02.917
Then, what are we doing about it?

00:53:02.999 --> 00:53:04.999
Normal life you do see that way,

00:53:04.999 --> 00:53:08.291
like if somebody is selected for a post or something,

00:53:08.417 --> 00:53:11.000
out of many, many things, "Oh must be something about me,

00:53:11.125 --> 00:53:13.959
I must show my worth, I must show my value,

00:53:13.999 --> 00:53:15.999
I must show my work," you see,

00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:22.792
and he works hard to prove that the selection was good.

00:53:22.917 --> 00:53:25.834
But in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:28.041
you take it for granted,

00:53:28.166 --> 00:53:30.583
"Oh, we are something great."

00:53:30.709 --> 00:53:37.583
So now settle down with yourself - have a cup of tea.

00:53:41.125 --> 00:53:45.542
I hope it has been understood why I am saying so,

00:53:45.667 --> 00:53:48.750
because I am really concerned about America.

00:53:48.875 --> 00:53:50.999
So many negative forces are working here

00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:55.999
and we have to improve.

00:53:57.083 --> 00:54:00.208
So many things such a big responsibility,

00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:03.166
such a big country, such a vast country,

00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:11.583
so much perversion, so much nonsensical ideologies,

00:54:11.709 --> 00:54:14.917
I mean endless.

00:54:14.999 --> 00:54:20.834
Even if you get fifteen Gorbachevs, you cannot change this country.

00:54:21.667 --> 00:54:24.333
It has gone amuck.

00:54:24.458 --> 00:54:26.999
Everybody's an individual,

00:54:26.999 --> 00:54:29.500
this mad place.

00:54:29.625 --> 00:54:32.667
One Gorbachev can change that country

00:54:32.792 --> 00:54:35.166
which has much more population.

00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:37.208
But no one can change this country

00:54:37.333 --> 00:54:42.458
unless and until you people decide to do something about it.

00:54:44.166 --> 00:54:46.583
So I'm told some people are frustrated

00:54:46.709 --> 00:54:49.333
because there are not so many Sahaja Yogis are coming,

00:54:49.458 --> 00:54:51.792
but may be something wrong with you.

00:54:51.917 --> 00:54:53.500
Maybe that you are not deep enough

00:54:53.625 --> 00:54:58.875
and that you are not so much impressive.

00:55:01.083 --> 00:55:03.417
You have to change your life style,

00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:11.333
you have to be smart people and spartan.

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:18.000
I hope, I hope again and again that after this Virata's Puja

00:55:18.125 --> 00:55:22.166
you all will come up on the stage as great Viratas.

00:55:22.333 --> 00:55:23.999
May God bless you all.
