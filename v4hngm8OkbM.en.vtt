00:00.165 --> 00:03.444
Shri Lalita & Shri Chakra Puja, Brahmapuri (India), 17 Decembre 1990.

00:04.320 --> 00:07.240
The knowledge about Kundalini

00:07.360 --> 00:15.320
has been expressed in many Sanskrit Shastras since long

00:17.760 --> 00:24.760
and also in Ayurveda it is described, not only that

00:25.120 --> 00:32.960
but the books which are for curriculum talk about Kundalini and the chakras,

00:35.160 --> 00:40.080
because Ayurveda is very, very close to Sahaja Yoga.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.960
Even in the western medicine to begin with,

00:47.080 --> 00:53.920
you should see the history they took to -dealt with three doshas.

00:54.120 --> 01:04.040
They dealt with three problems that we have as in Ayurveda.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.920
The right side which has got Pitta means bile;

01:11.040 --> 01:15.440
left side which has got Kapha means phlegm,

01:15.560 --> 01:24.120
and the central part, the problems of vayu means the gases.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.800
Now luckily so many western people have taken to Sahaja Yoga

01:33.000 --> 01:37.800
and have tried to bring down all the permutations and combinations

01:37.920 --> 01:42.920
to the simple reasoning of left, right and centre.

01:43.920 --> 01:53.560
But the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely basics;

01:54.800 --> 02:01.240
even in Ayurveda is one step away from reality,

02:02.080 --> 02:04.960
of which it says the fundamentals.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.520
So you are dealing with the fundamentals of which a human being is built.

02:11.440 --> 02:17.840
And if this knowledge was found out long time back in India,

02:18.200 --> 02:20.880
should we not accept it?

02:22.200 --> 02:26.000
The reason why people went into meditation in those days

02:26.160 --> 02:31.440
and found out all these deeper things within ourselves,

02:32.040 --> 02:35.600
because they didn’t have to fight the nature.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.920
You have seen here nature how beautiful it is.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.880
You can spend all your life under a tree,

02:44.680 --> 02:49.800
while in the West, even before getting out of the house you have to take

02:50.040 --> 02:54.560
at least 15 to 20 minutes to be prepared to go out.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.960
It’s quite a struggle.

03:00.280 --> 03:06.640
So the nature has been so kind and that is the reason people took to meditation

03:06.800 --> 03:10.600
and found out all these deeper things within themselves.

03:13.160 --> 03:19.760
When they found it out it was all written in Sanskrit language.

03:21.720 --> 03:28.360
I have such a big thick book on this, which has described all the Shakti,

03:28.800 --> 03:38.160
Pithas and all the Shri Chakras, Brahma chakra, lalita chakras and all that.

03:38.640 --> 03:45.520
But this was just written down, but hardly any person got realisation.

03:47.480 --> 03:53.640
But in any other language like Marathi or Hindi

03:53.760 --> 03:58.960
which was spoken and written by common people nothing was done.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.360
Nobody knew about it; only a few people who read about it.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.920
Especially the Shaiwas, they went into the research

04:09.040 --> 04:11.040
and they went into the world.

04:11.160 --> 04:15.280
But very few people really got realisation; very, very few.

04:16.040 --> 04:28.520
Then in the 12th century, only the Nath Panthis, who were experts of Sanskrit,

04:28.640 --> 04:30.800
who were following it rigidly,

04:30.920 --> 04:34.840
that one master, should have one disciple not more than that.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.600
This was their tradition.

04:38.040 --> 04:45.480
But in the 12th century Gyanadeva,Gyaneshwara, who was another Nath Panthi,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.400
his guru was his own brother,

04:56.360 --> 05:00.440
he asked the permission from his brother that please allow me

05:00.640 --> 05:04.440
to say all these things openly.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.440
At least to say in Marathi language

05:12.600 --> 05:17.120
because the common people don’t know anything about this knowledge.

05:17.400 --> 05:25.320
So he allowed him and he wrote the 6th chapter of Gyanaeshwari

05:25.440 --> 05:28.720
in which he described Kundalini.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.800
But it was in the 12th century.

05:34.320 --> 05:39.000
After that many saints described and talked about it.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.400
Where we went yesterday to Satara,

05:41.520 --> 05:45.040
you know that’s the place where Shri Ramdasa lived.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.440
He said that Kundalini -there somebody asked him

05:50.560 --> 05:53.760
“How much time does it take to raise the Kundalini?" –

05:53.920 --> 05:57.240
he said that Tatshan. Means that moment.

05:57.360 --> 06:02.320
But the person who wants to take it should be deserving

06:03.040 --> 06:05.760
and the one who wants to give should be capable.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.560
It's a big condition.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.000
This is such a big if- a capital if I tell you.

06:13.520 --> 06:19.160
As a result very, very few peop1e got their realisation,

06:19.840 --> 06:22.320
and those who were born as realised souls

06:22.440 --> 06:24.760
found it impossible to talk to people.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.440
Gyaneshwara, such an enlightened soul himself

06:28.560 --> 06:30.960
wrote one beautiful book called “Amruta Anubhav”

06:31.080 --> 06:33.960
which I will try to translate,

06:35.440 --> 06:39.840
which is very joy giving. To me at least it’s very great joy giving.

06:39.960 --> 06:44.720
He went so deep into the understanding of this joy.

06:45.360 --> 06:52.480
I wish English language would provide me that subtlety to translate that book.

06:53.080 --> 07:05.160
That he wrote all these things when he was only 23 years of age

07:06.240 --> 07:13.960
and at the age of 23 years he got so fed up that he took a living Samadhi

07:14.080 --> 07:18.320
that is he entered into a cave and killed himself.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.440
They all tortured him very much.

07:22.560 --> 07:28.200
Nowadays this 'Andha Shraddha', stupid thing, is not tortured as much,

07:30.440 --> 07:32.680
but all these saints in this country

07:32.800 --> 07:36.920
or any country have been very much tortured,

07:37.040 --> 07:40.040
and there was no police protection.

07:40.240 --> 07:48.000
There was no one to publish about what these people are up to.

07:54.280 --> 08:00.120
Despite all that, I find there are many Sahaja Yogis

08:00.240 --> 08:07.160
who are now occupying very big positions in the government

08:10.840 --> 08:17.880
and a day may come when everything will explode.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.640
The biggest problem of our country is something you cannot understand

08:22.760 --> 08:25.800
because you don’t have this problem.

08:26.080 --> 08:32.240
The amount of corruption we have from A to Z for everything.

08:33.080 --> 08:38.040
That you cannot understand, I mean I have never known any country

08:38.160 --> 08:41.280
where they have this to such an extent.

08:41.400 --> 08:47.400
Even say in Philippines, it was only one person who was doing it.

08:47.520 --> 08:52.400
Here every person has to get the money

08:52.680 --> 08:57.840
and has to pay the money to hire Johns.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.080
For this also unless and until you get to Sahaja Yoga it won' t work out.

09:06.680 --> 09:11.120
And Sahaja Yoga can only be worked out

09:11.240 --> 09:17.320
if people understand that it is their heritage

09:18.040 --> 09:21.200
and that they have the capacity

09:21.320 --> 09:26.960
to understand Sahaja Yoga and capability to spread it.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.920
In north India it is much better,

09:32.040 --> 09:35.720
although the vibrations in Maharashtra are much better;

09:35.840 --> 09:37.560
it is something funny.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.480
Vibrations in Maharashtra are very good.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.160
The people in the north India are very good Sahaja Yogis

09:43.280 --> 09:47.480
and they are many, many, many in number.

09:48.640 --> 09:53.160
We can' t say, even in Bombay we get about 12000 people for my programmes,

09:53.320 --> 10:01.320
but still the way it is spreading in North India is very surprising.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.360
Also it is spreading.

10:05.480 --> 10:15.920
This is Satara because it was blessed by Ramdasa, this district.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.280
I think everywhere there is a flower there has to be thorns

10:20.400 --> 10:24.920
and this district has got some really very bad culprits.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.360
Ahmednagar is much better.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.040
Aurangabad we are doing much better;

10:31.160 --> 10:33.520
it will work out in Aurangabad much better.

10:33.640 --> 10:37.080
And then if you go to the other side Berhar-

10:37.200 --> 10:41.520
from where I come is going to work out very fast.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.400
Things are moving very fast there.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.200
I was amazed so many people have told me that

10:46.320 --> 10:50.120
in Amravati so many are Sahaja Yogis and in Akola, so many are there.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.760
I was surprised, I have never been there.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.520
So that is how it is spreading in Maharashtra.

10:58.640 --> 11:03.200
So your song of Maharashtra Desha is working out. It’s not failing.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.200
But I think Satara is the most difficult place.

11:08.320 --> 11:14.080
Where we worked out yesterday I gave them left and right as to what they are.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.880
It has helped them a lot,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.200
because those who came to opposes at down and got their Realisation.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.120
So they are misleading people

11:24.240 --> 11:28.920
to start some sort of a new culture, like you started hippism.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.920
And they are collecting young people,

11:34.320 --> 11:36.880
that young people are leaving their schools.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.040
Some parents come and complained to me about it.

11:40.160 --> 11:44.120
They are not paying attention to their studies,

11:44.240 --> 11:46.960
they are failing in their classes

11:47.080 --> 11:53.000
and these people are stupidly using them.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.680
I asked some of the boys "what is your policy?"

11:57.880 --> 12:00.520
He said "We have no policy".

12:00.640 --> 12:02.800
"Then what is your aim?".

12:02.920 --> 12:04.920
"We have no aim".

12:05.040 --> 12:07.440
"Then why are you doing this nonsense?"

12:07.560 --> 12:10.240
They said because whatever the elders tell us, we do it."

12:10.360 --> 12:13.800
I said: "Have you no personality? Nothing?"

12:14.600 --> 12:21.280
It’s exactly what happened when this hippy movement started.

12:22.360 --> 12:28.560
Some so-called intellectuals started this horrible hippy movement in the West

12:28.960 --> 12:32.880
and when they found they cannot do anything about it,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.360
they found it’s going to fail.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.920
So many children lost their education.

12:39.040 --> 12:47.240
So many children I know became pregnant girls and boys started squatting.

12:48.960 --> 12:55.560
All that took them to the extreme that they became violent.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.880
But unless and until there is a change within yourself,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.120
how can you change anything outside?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.200
You cannot.

13:04.880 --> 13:11.480
And the first 7 people I fought, were all hippies; very difficult.

13:12.280 --> 13:18.200
They called themselves hippies but they used to honk like a pig.

13:18.320 --> 13:23.000
They wanted all the comforts, everything free,

13:23.160 --> 13:26.720
extremely dominating and quarrelsome people.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.120
But the foundation was laid on them.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.800
Very surprising.

13:31.920 --> 13:39.040
But I had to work on them for at least 4 years regularly.

14:00.760 --> 14:05.520
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started

14:05.640 --> 14:11.400
and today you know how much it has spread, how far it has gone.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.360
Only in Maharashtra this problem is there of so-called intellectuals,

14:15.480 --> 14:19.040
they call themselves, but they have no intelligence.

14:19.280 --> 14:22.200
I talked to one man. I got fed up.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.440
He didn't know anything about spirituality,

14:24.560 --> 14:28.800
he didn't know anything about medicine, he didn't know anything about science.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.400
I said “Now what do you know?”

14:32.520 --> 14:35.280
It was impossible.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.920
So such people who are jobless, we call them ‘recanting', they have no work.

14:40.040 --> 14:45.960
They are starting all such things and we should not be upset with them.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.360
They are trying to create problems

14:48.480 --> 14:51.960
and they are getting money from some sources.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.320
They are afraid. I think the politicians are afraid,

14:56.440 --> 15:02.120
perhaps that Sahaja Yoga may turn their tables down,

15:02.280 --> 15:06.000
because we believe in honesty

15:06.320 --> 15:10.520
and maybe a day may come when these honest people might harm them,

15:10.640 --> 15:13.320
perhaps. I do not know why.

15:13.440 --> 15:20.440
This may be one of the reasons these people are frightened of us.

15:23.520 --> 15:29.000
Whatever it is we have to understand that for doing any great work,

15:29.120 --> 15:33.240
one has to sacrifice.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.280
Of course you are not going to be crucified like Christ, no.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.760
Nor do you have to sacrifice as my parents

15:39.880 --> 15:42.640
sacrificed for the independence of this country.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.200
Nor are you going to be tortured.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.680
But little inconveniences you may have.

15:48.800 --> 15:53.600
But I must thank you very much because of your coming here

15:53.720 --> 15:57.080
and singing Marathi songs. They are quite impressed

15:57.200 --> 16:01.120
and they think it's only possible because you are all Sahaja Yogis

16:01.360 --> 16:03.840
otherwise you could not have done it.

16:05.880 --> 16:11.800
So if there are any inconveniences, think that it is a joke, that's all.

16:15.840 --> 16:20.960
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja of Shri Chakra and Lalita Chakra

16:21.080 --> 16:23.160
which we have never done.

16:23.280 --> 16:27.960
This is the right place to do these two chakras today.

16:33.160 --> 16:38.080
A lot has been written about Shri Chakra, and about Lalita Chakra,

16:38.240 --> 16:48.600
but to understand fundamentally, the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,

16:48.720 --> 16:56.240
then it uses on the right side the Shri Chakra,

16:56.360 --> 17:01.560
on the left side the Lalita Chakra, to manifest itself.

17:04.280 --> 17:14.120
These two chakras are the ones who manifest all that you see.

17:17.320 --> 17:24.480
But these chakras are the ones who emit vibrations of different kinds

17:24.720 --> 17:35.200
and because of their angularities, like if you have some sort of a cardboard

17:35.320 --> 17:39.240
attached with small-small holes of different colours

17:39.360 --> 17:42.120
which rotates all the time,

17:42.240 --> 17:45.240
you get different colours, also you can get

17:45.360 --> 17:48.400
different permutations and combinations.

17:50.080 --> 17:56.240
In the same way different permutations and combinations are created,

17:56.360 --> 18:00.680
and that is how you get all the advantages of Sahaja Yoga.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.480
So these two chakras are very important.

18:04.640 --> 18:09.760
I do not know if you know of any mantras about Shri Chakra

18:09.880 --> 18:13.720
but I'll give you a book. Later on I'll translate it to you

18:13.840 --> 18:18.520
and you can compose something for Shri Chakra.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.880
Shri Chakra on the right side, Lalita Chakra on the left side.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.640
So what we are really worshipping today is

18:26.720 --> 18:32.680
Maha Saraswati Power and Maha Kali Power both put together.

18:32.880 --> 18:37.680
So now we've started combining things, not individually.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.960
Now these two energies are very important.

18:43.840 --> 18:48.920
Without the energy, without the power, nothing exists,

18:49.240 --> 18:57.760
for example if this light had no power to give light or to burn it is useless.

19:01.080 --> 19:08.440
In the same way without getting your realisation, you are useless,

19:08.560 --> 19:11.920
because your power is not awakened.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.920
At least not completely.

19:14.040 --> 19:28.680
But these two powers, give us lots of benefits even without realisation.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.240
Whatever you see in this world created,

19:33.360 --> 19:39.200
is done by these two chakras of the Adi Shakti.

19:41.120 --> 19:46.280
But here the power doesn't move, it's not moving.

19:46.880 --> 19:57.040
But in the human being the power starts moving, and when it starts moving

19:57.160 --> 20:06.120
then we can say it is creating another world.

20:06.240 --> 20:10.240
But movement is not the only thing.

20:10.880 --> 20:16.920
This power acts, gives you intelligence, gives you all kinds of things

20:17.040 --> 20:20.440
which you have as human beings.

20:21.920 --> 20:27.720
But later on, this power itself becomes enlightened within you.

20:28.440 --> 20:34.720
In the left and right side both become enlightened.

20:34.960 --> 20:40.800
This enlightenment, you get it when you get yourself realisation,

20:41.000 --> 20:46.120
but not immediately, not immediately, this one should understand.

20:46.240 --> 20:54.320
For example, if you have pain, or if your chakra is catching,

20:54.960 --> 20:57.880
you have to use your hands.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.720
You cannot say that, 'the energy is flowing within me,

21:00.840 --> 21:04.880
it's alright, I can manage', it's not like that.

21:05.000 --> 21:13.520
You have to use your hands to impart that power to yourself or to others.

21:13.640 --> 21:18.760
If you have pain in the stomach, then you can say that if there's energy

21:18.880 --> 21:23.960
in my stomach why should I have pain in the stomach?

21:24.240 --> 21:28.040
But the play of these chakras have to come,

21:29.320 --> 21:40.240
and that is why you have to use your power of your hands.

21:42.400 --> 21:50.080
If you cannot use your hands, then you cannot impart this energy.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.520
Many people have asked me,

21:52.640 --> 21:58.560
that Mother, when will it move horizontal?

21:59.880 --> 22:05.000
It will move horizontal no doubt, it does,

22:05.120 --> 22:08.080
but even that horizontal movement

22:08.200 --> 22:14.320
is to be guided by these two very important chakras.

22:15.160 --> 22:20.520
So you must understand the importance of these two chakras within yourself.

22:20.640 --> 22:25.040
That's why I have told many a times, don't move your head too many times,

22:25.200 --> 22:31.320
and this way many people talk, this style of talking, "no, this, that,"

22:31.560 --> 22:34.920
very common with French especially.

22:35.040 --> 22:39.640
That's another way you are not respecting your chakras,

22:39.760 --> 22:43.320
shouldn't move your shoulders too much.

22:43.440 --> 22:51.000
Mostly they talk like this, it's anti-chakras, anti-chakras.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.680
Should keep your shoulders straight.

22:54.880 --> 23:01.000
When you are singing you can move your whole upper part,

23:01.120 --> 23:06.200
is all right, but not your shoulders.

23:06.320 --> 23:09.720
This is the thing, one has to understand,

23:09.840 --> 23:14.040
that these two centres are to be looked after.

23:14.480 --> 23:19.920
You can move your neck, your body when you are singing,

23:20.040 --> 23:22.680
is important, that helps,

23:24.280 --> 23:27.080
but not your shoulders.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.400
Shoulders are to be kept intact,

23:30.760 --> 23:35.560
but while saying just yes, you need not go on "yes, yes, yes, yes."

23:35.640 --> 23:40.240
Is very very simple thing, but it can have a very bad effect,

23:40.360 --> 23:46.000
and those who move their shoulders too much do not feel vibrations much

23:46.120 --> 23:51.080
because the chakras are not alright.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.120
It's a very simple thing to be understood

23:57.240 --> 24:00.840
that they are the most important chakras we have

24:00.960 --> 24:06.720
and whatever is to be used out of this Paramachaitanya,

24:06.840 --> 24:12.040
they have to be used by these two centres.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.800
Even supposing your some chakra is catching on your spinal cord,

24:16.920 --> 24:20.240
you have to use your hands.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.040
Somebody can say, "I can just put my attention."

24:24.160 --> 24:27.160
Doesn't work out, that good.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.920
Because yet your attention has not that,

24:31.040 --> 24:33.800
reached that stage where these chakras,

24:34.080 --> 24:42.160
like Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra obey your attention, they do not.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.800
So you have to work out with your hands, be careful,

24:49.920 --> 24:52.920
don't move your shoulders too much.

24:53.040 --> 24:58.480
And, if you see now Indians when they sing bhajans, they move the whole body.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.480
They'll do like this, but never their shoulders.

25:01.600 --> 25:07.080
The shoulders will move in the same way as the neck is moving.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.960
They might move their neck also.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.680
But they'll never move their shoulder like this,

25:11.800 --> 25:17.360
and it's regarded as inauspicious according to Indian standards.

25:18.760 --> 25:24.760
Because of this culture, based on what the saints have told,

25:24.920 --> 25:28.280
and also about many seers have told,

25:28.400 --> 25:33.440
it is more related to spiritual life than to materialistic life.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.520
Now the materialistic life,

25:36.640 --> 25:40.240
unless and until there is the foundation of the spiritual life,

25:40.360 --> 25:47.600
takes you to a very partial development, we can say.

25:47.720 --> 25:58.360
But to get a full development, you must have your foundation on spirituality.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.440
That's why spirituality being the foundation has to be deep,

26:03.560 --> 26:09.840
has to be fully equipped, has to be absolutely perfect.

26:09.960 --> 26:13.240
Then the whole building can be built.

26:14.360 --> 26:19.800
It's gone wrong in the West, doesn't matter, now you can build it up,

26:19.920 --> 26:25.960
and then, you'll be surprised how you become really solid people.

26:28.840 --> 26:33.000
This is a very short talk about Shri Chakra.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.000
I think I should sit down and write all about it,

26:36.120 --> 26:40.440
and it will be nice handy thing for you to read.

26:42.400 --> 26:48.400
But you must know, that, beyond thought when you go,

26:50.440 --> 26:55.440
these chakras become extremely efficient,

26:55.560 --> 27:00.320
because the thought puts a pressure on them,

27:00.480 --> 27:03.960
and because of the pressure the movement of these chakras

27:04.080 --> 27:07.080
is very slow and ineffective.

27:07.280 --> 27:13.160
But once you can get out of your thoughts and go into thoughtless awareness,

27:13.320 --> 27:15.760
then these chakras start working it out

27:15.920 --> 27:19.800
and you start moving much deeper into your own being.
