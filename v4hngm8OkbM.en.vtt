00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.444
Shri Lalita & Shri Chakra Puja, Brahmapuri (India), 17 Decembre 1990.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.240
The knowledge about Kundalini

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.320
has been expressed in many Sanskrit Shastras since long

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.760
and also in Ayurveda it is described, not only that

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.960
but the books which are for curriculum talk about Kundalini and the chakras,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.080
because Ayurveda is very, very close to Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.960
Even in the western medicine to begin with,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.920
you should see the history they took to -dealt with three doshas.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:04.040
They dealt with three problems that we have as in Ayurveda.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.920
The right side which has got Pitta means bile;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.440
left side which has got Kapha means phlegm,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.120
and the central part, the problems of vayu means the gases.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.800
Now luckily so many western people have taken to Sahaja Yoga

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.800
and have tried to bring down all the permutations and combinations

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.920
to the simple reasoning of left, right and centre.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:53.560
But the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely basics;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.240
even in Ayurveda is one step away from reality,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.960
of which it says the fundamentals.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.520
So you are dealing with the fundamentals of which a human being is built.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.840
And if this knowledge was found out long time back in India,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.880
should we not accept it?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.000
The reason why people went into meditation in those days

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.440
and found out all these deeper things within ourselves,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.600
because they didn’t have to fight the nature.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.920
You have seen here nature how beautiful it is.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.880
You can spend all your life under a tree,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.800
while in the West, even before getting out of the house you have to take

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.560
at least 15 to 20 minutes to be prepared to go out.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.960
It’s quite a struggle.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.640
So the nature has been so kind and that is the reason people took to meditation

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.600
and found out all these deeper things within themselves.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.760
When they found it out it was all written in Sanskrit language.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.360
I have such a big thick book on this, which has described all the Shakti,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:38.160
Pithas and all the Shri Chakras, Brahma chakra, lalita chakras and all that.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.520
But this was just written down, but hardly any person got realisation.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.640
But in any other language like Marathi or Hindi

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.960
which was spoken and written by common people nothing was done.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.360
Nobody knew about it; only a few people who read about it.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.920
Especially the Shaiwas, they went into the research

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040
and they went into the world.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.280
But very few people really got realisation; very, very few.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:28.520
Then in the 12th century, only the Nath Panthis, who were experts of Sanskrit,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.800
who were following it rigidly,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.840
that one master, should have one disciple not more than that.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.600
This was their tradition.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:45.480
But in the 12th century Gyanadeva,Gyaneshwara, who was another Nath Panthi,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.400
his guru was his own brother,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.440
he asked the permission from his brother that please allow me

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.440
to say all these things openly.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.440
At least to say in Marathi language

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.120
because the common people don’t know anything about this knowledge.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.320
So he allowed him and he wrote the 6th chapter of Gyanaeshwari

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.720
in which he described Kundalini.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.800
But it was in the 12th century.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.000
After that many saints described and talked about it.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.400
Where we went yesterday to Satara,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.040
you know that’s the place where Shri Ramdasa lived.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.440
He said that Kundalini -there somebody asked him

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.760
“How much time does it take to raise the Kundalini?" –

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.240
he said that Tatshan. Means that moment.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.320
But the person who wants to take it should be deserving

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.760
and the one who wants to give should be capable.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.560
It's a big condition.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.000
This is such a big if- a capital if I tell you.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.160
As a result very, very few peop1e got their realisation,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.320
and those who were born as realised souls

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.760
found it impossible to talk to people.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.440
Gyaneshwara, such an enlightened soul himself

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.960
wrote one beautiful book called “Amruta Anubhav”

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.960
which I will try to translate,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.840
which is very joy giving. To me at least it’s very great joy giving.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.720
He went so deep into the understanding of this joy.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.480
I wish English language would provide me that subtlety to translate that book.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:05.160
That he wrote all these things when he was only 23 years of age

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.960
and at the age of 23 years he got so fed up that he took a living Samadhi

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.320
that is he entered into a cave and killed himself.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.440
They all tortured him very much.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.200
Nowadays this 'Andha Shraddha', stupid thing, is not tortured as much,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.680
but all these saints in this country

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.920
or any country have been very much tortured,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.040
and there was no police protection.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:48.000
There was no one to publish about what these people are up to.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:00.120
Despite all that, I find there are many Sahaja Yogis

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:07.160
who are now occupying very big positions in the government

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.880
and a day may come when everything will explode.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.640
The biggest problem of our country is something you cannot understand

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.800
because you don’t have this problem.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.240
The amount of corruption we have from A to Z for everything.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.040
That you cannot understand, I mean I have never known any country

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.280
where they have this to such an extent.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:47.400
Even say in Philippines, it was only one person who was doing it.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.400
Here every person has to get the money

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.840
and has to pay the money to hire Johns.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.080
For this also unless and until you get to Sahaja Yoga it won' t work out.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.120
And Sahaja Yoga can only be worked out

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.320
if people understand that it is their heritage

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.200
and that they have the capacity

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.960
to understand Sahaja Yoga and capability to spread it.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.920
In north India it is much better,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.720
although the vibrations in Maharashtra are much better;

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.560
it is something funny.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.480
Vibrations in Maharashtra are very good.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.160
The people in the north India are very good Sahaja Yogis

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.480
and they are many, many, many in number.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.160
We can' t say, even in Bombay we get about 12000 people for my programmes,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:01.320
but still the way it is spreading in North India is very surprising.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.360
Also it is spreading.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:15.920
This is Satara because it was blessed by Ramdasa, this district.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.280
I think everywhere there is a flower there has to be thorns

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.920
and this district has got some really very bad culprits.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.360
Ahmednagar is much better.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.040
Aurangabad we are doing much better;

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.520
it will work out in Aurangabad much better.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.080
And then if you go to the other side Berhar-

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.520
from where I come is going to work out very fast.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.400
Things are moving very fast there.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.200
I was amazed so many people have told me that

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.120
in Amravati so many are Sahaja Yogis and in Akola, so many are there.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.760
I was surprised, I have never been there.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.520
So that is how it is spreading in Maharashtra.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.200
So your song of Maharashtra Desha is working out. It’s not failing.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.200
But I think Satara is the most difficult place.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.080
Where we worked out yesterday I gave them left and right as to what they are.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.880
It has helped them a lot,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.200
because those who came to opposes at down and got their Realisation.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.120
So they are misleading people

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.920
to start some sort of a new culture, like you started hippism.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.920
And they are collecting young people,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.880
that young people are leaving their schools.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.040
Some parents come and complained to me about it.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.120
They are not paying attention to their studies,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.960
they are failing in their classes

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:53.000
and these people are stupidly using them.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.680
I asked some of the boys "what is your policy?"

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.520
He said "We have no policy".

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.800
"Then what is your aim?".

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.920
"We have no aim".

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.440
"Then why are you doing this nonsense?"

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.240
They said because whatever the elders tell us, we do it."

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.800
I said: "Have you no personality? Nothing?"

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:21.280
It’s exactly what happened when this hippy movement started.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.560
Some so-called intellectuals started this horrible hippy movement in the West

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.880
and when they found they cannot do anything about it,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.360
they found it’s going to fail.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.920
So many children lost their education.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:47.240
So many children I know became pregnant girls and boys started squatting.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:55.560
All that took them to the extreme that they became violent.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.880
But unless and until there is a change within yourself,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.120
how can you change anything outside?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.200
You cannot.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.480
And the first 7 people I fought, were all hippies; very difficult.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.200
They called themselves hippies but they used to honk like a pig.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.000
They wanted all the comforts, everything free,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.720
extremely dominating and quarrelsome people.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.120
But the foundation was laid on them.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.800
Very surprising.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:39.040
But I had to work on them for at least 4 years regularly.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.520
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:11.400
and today you know how much it has spread, how far it has gone.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.360
Only in Maharashtra this problem is there of so-called intellectuals,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.040
they call themselves, but they have no intelligence.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.200
I talked to one man. I got fed up.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.440
He didn't know anything about spirituality,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.800
he didn't know anything about medicine, he didn't know anything about science.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.400
I said “Now what do you know?”

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.280
It was impossible.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.920
So such people who are jobless, we call them ‘recanting', they have no work.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.960
They are starting all such things and we should not be upset with them.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.360
They are trying to create problems

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.960
and they are getting money from some sources.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.320
They are afraid. I think the politicians are afraid,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:02.120
perhaps that Sahaja Yoga may turn their tables down,

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.000
because we believe in honesty

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.520
and maybe a day may come when these honest people might harm them,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.320
perhaps. I do not know why.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:20.440
This may be one of the reasons these people are frightened of us.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.000
Whatever it is we have to understand that for doing any great work,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.240
one has to sacrifice.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.280
Of course you are not going to be crucified like Christ, no.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.760
Nor do you have to sacrifice as my parents

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.640
sacrificed for the independence of this country.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.200
Nor are you going to be tortured.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.680
But little inconveniences you may have.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.600
But I must thank you very much because of your coming here

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.080
and singing Marathi songs. They are quite impressed

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.120
and they think it's only possible because you are all Sahaja Yogis

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.840
otherwise you could not have done it.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:11.800
So if there are any inconveniences, think that it is a joke, that's all.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.960
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja of Shri Chakra and Lalita Chakra

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.160
which we have never done.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.960
This is the right place to do these two chakras today.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.080
A lot has been written about Shri Chakra, and about Lalita Chakra,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:48.600
but to understand fundamentally, the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:56.240
then it uses on the right side the Shri Chakra,

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.560
on the left side the Lalita Chakra, to manifest itself.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:14.120
These two chakras are the ones who manifest all that you see.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:24.480
But these chakras are the ones who emit vibrations of different kinds

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:35.200
and because of their angularities, like if you have some sort of a cardboard

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.240
attached with small-small holes of different colours

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.120
which rotates all the time,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.240
you get different colours, also you can get

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.400
different permutations and combinations.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.240
In the same way different permutations and combinations are created,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.680
and that is how you get all the advantages of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.480
So these two chakras are very important.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.760
I do not know if you know of any mantras about Shri Chakra

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.720
but I'll give you a book. Later on I'll translate it to you

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.520
and you can compose something for Shri Chakra.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.880
Shri Chakra on the right side, Lalita Chakra on the left side.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.640
So what we are really worshipping today is

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.680
Maha Saraswati Power and Maha Kali Power both put together.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.680
So now we've started combining things, not individually.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.960
Now these two energies are very important.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.920
Without the energy, without the power, nothing exists,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:57.760
for example if this light had no power to give light or to burn it is useless.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:08.440
In the same way without getting your realisation, you are useless,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.920
because your power is not awakened.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.920
At least not completely.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:28.680
But these two powers, give us lots of benefits even without realisation.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.240
Whatever you see in this world created,

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.200
is done by these two chakras of the Adi Shakti.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.280
But here the power doesn't move, it's not moving.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:57.040
But in the human being the power starts moving, and when it starts moving

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:06.120
then we can say it is creating another world.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.240
But movement is not the only thing.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.920
This power acts, gives you intelligence, gives you all kinds of things

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.440
which you have as human beings.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.720
But later on, this power itself becomes enlightened within you.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:34.720
In the left and right side both become enlightened.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:40.800
This enlightenment, you get it when you get yourself realisation,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.120
but not immediately, not immediately, this one should understand.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:54.320
For example, if you have pain, or if your chakra is catching,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.880
you have to use your hands.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.720
You cannot say that, 'the energy is flowing within me,

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.880
it's alright, I can manage', it's not like that.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.520
You have to use your hands to impart that power to yourself or to others.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.760
If you have pain in the stomach, then you can say that if there's energy

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.960
in my stomach why should I have pain in the stomach?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.040
But the play of these chakras have to come,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:40.240
and that is why you have to use your power of your hands.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:50.080
If you cannot use your hands, then you cannot impart this energy.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.520
Many people have asked me,

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:58.560
that Mother, when will it move horizontal?

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.000
It will move horizontal no doubt, it does,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.080
but even that horizontal movement

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:14.320
is to be guided by these two very important chakras.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.520
So you must understand the importance of these two chakras within yourself.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.040
That's why I have told many a times, don't move your head too many times,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:31.320
and this way many people talk, this style of talking, "no, this, that,"

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.920
very common with French especially.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.640
That's another way you are not respecting your chakras,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.320
shouldn't move your shoulders too much.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:51.000
Mostly they talk like this, it's anti-chakras, anti-chakras.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.680
Should keep your shoulders straight.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.000
When you are singing you can move your whole upper part,

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.200
is all right, but not your shoulders.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.720
This is the thing, one has to understand,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.040
that these two centres are to be looked after.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.920
You can move your neck, your body when you are singing,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.680
is important, that helps,

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.080
but not your shoulders.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.400
Shoulders are to be kept intact,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.560
but while saying just yes, you need not go on "yes, yes, yes, yes."

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.240
Is very very simple thing, but it can have a very bad effect,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.000
and those who move their shoulders too much do not feel vibrations much

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.080
because the chakras are not alright.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.120
It's a very simple thing to be understood

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.840
that they are the most important chakras we have

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.720
and whatever is to be used out of this Paramachaitanya,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.040
they have to be used by these two centres.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.800
Even supposing your some chakra is catching on your spinal cord,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.240
you have to use your hands.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.040
Somebody can say, "I can just put my attention."

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.160
Doesn't work out, that good.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.920
Because yet your attention has not that,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.800
reached that stage where these chakras,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:42.160
like Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra obey your attention, they do not.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.800
So you have to work out with your hands, be careful,

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.920
don't move your shoulders too much.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.480
And, if you see now Indians when they sing bhajans, they move the whole body.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.480
They'll do like this, but never their shoulders.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.080
The shoulders will move in the same way as the neck is moving.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.960
They might move their neck also.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.680
But they'll never move their shoulder like this,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.360
and it's regarded as inauspicious according to Indian standards.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:24.760
Because of this culture, based on what the saints have told,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.280
and also about many seers have told,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.440
it is more related to spiritual life than to materialistic life.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.520
Now the materialistic life,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.240
unless and until there is the foundation of the spiritual life,

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:47.600
takes you to a very partial development, we can say.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:58.360
But to get a full development, you must have your foundation on spirituality.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.440
That's why spirituality being the foundation has to be deep,

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:09.840
has to be fully equipped, has to be absolutely perfect.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.240
Then the whole building can be built.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.800
It's gone wrong in the West, doesn't matter, now you can build it up,

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.960
and then, you'll be surprised how you become really solid people.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.000
This is a very short talk about Shri Chakra.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.000
I think I should sit down and write all about it,

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.440
and it will be nice handy thing for you to read.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.400
But you must know, that, beyond thought when you go,

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.440
these chakras become extremely efficient,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.320
because the thought puts a pressure on them,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.960
and because of the pressure the movement of these chakras

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.080
is very slow and ineffective.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:13.160
But once you can get out of your thoughts and go into thoughtless awareness,

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.760
then these chakras start working it out

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.800
and you start moving much deeper into your own being.
