00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.760
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.880
Definitely it is evident today

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.799
that you have come here all the way in the rain

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.840
to seek the truth, that you are real seekers.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.399
And the real seekers

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.800
will find the real way.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.698
Whatever they may do, whatever wrong path they may take,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.884
they may identify themselves with wrong things also,

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.812
and may oppose in the beginning the truth,

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:57.400
but ultimately they will all find the real path,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.735
as long as they do not try to deceive themselves.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.158
The awakening of the Kundalini

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.839
is not a new thing as you people may be thinking.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.439
It has been done since

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.351
sixteenth century back,

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:31.089
when it is said Indra, the God King,

00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:33.719
was given Realization.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.694
So you can imagine,

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:39.113
that is called as Siddhendra,

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:44.840
means the Indra first made a hole here.

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:49.399
And there’s a place where it was done in India.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.246
It’s a very ancient thing,

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:53.719
and at the time of Rama also,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.996
there was a fellow called Nachiketa

00:01:56.197 --> 00:02:00.748
who came to Rama’s father-in-law, Janaka,

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:05.590
and asked Him if he could get his Self Realization.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.919
And the father-in-law said that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.519
“You can ask anything but not for your Realization.”

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.989
He said, “No, I don’t want anything else but Realization”.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.496
And they say that He put him to test, many a times, for years,

00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:24.799
and then he was the first who got Realization,

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.775
at the time of Shri Rama.

00:02:28.557 --> 00:02:34.614
It is very interesting that how this system of Self Realization,

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:38.928
was kept more or less exclusive, and rather secretive,

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.010
because the people would like always

00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:47.310
to use this method to make some money out of it;

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:51.081
that they would not respect the reality,

00:02:51.282 --> 00:02:56.299
and would learn, say about your chakras, Kundalini,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.920
this, that, few words and start selling books

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.320
or posing that they are born again,

00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:05.638
and impressing others with it,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.798
and try to make some cults or some sort of groups,

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.359
just forming into some falsehood.

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:18.199
And that is the reason this was kept quite a secret.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.799
But on the right hand side of the seeking,

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.799
they tried to find out the ways and methods

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.559
how to initiate the elements within us, the casual of elements,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.519
first to initiate the causal of the elements,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.959
by which we could control the elements for our own purpose.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.319
This was one way where they called it as the Yagnya and all that.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.536
And that’s how the Vedas were written.

00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:48.999
Veda means vida, means to know.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.653
These were written to say that you have to know.

00:03:52.854 --> 00:03:55.880
And at the very beginning of the Vedas, it is written

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.022
that after reading this book, throughout,

00:03:59.223 --> 00:04:02.654
if you have not known the truth,

00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:05.679
it is of no use to you.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.439
The very first stanza says so.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.310
So the whole thing was done with that idea,

00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:15.627
and in the ancient country of India,

00:04:15.828 --> 00:04:17.963
they started working on the right side

00:04:18.164 --> 00:04:21.688
to know this subtle body

00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:25.184
or the subtle Deities of all the elements

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:28.760
so that they could master the elements; this was first idea.

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.713
On the left hand side, they started another kind of a search,

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:36.800
in believing that there is God,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.440
and we have to ask the help of God.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.773
And they started praying,

00:04:42.972 --> 00:04:45.039
first to Primordial Mother,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.399
because in every religion there is a place for the Mother.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.519
There’s no religion which does not believe in the Primordial Mother.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.440
You can say that at the time of Mohammed Sahib,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.159
He didn’t talk much about it, because the time was such.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.229
But His own daughter

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.467
was an incarnation of the Primordial Mother,

00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:08.439
whose name was Fatima Bi.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.931
And the two sons that were born to Her, are the sons

00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:19.166
who came on this earth also as Mahavira and Buddha.

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:21.393
And they were born even earlier.

00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:24.045
Like that, they were born again and again,

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:28.400
as these two elements, as the disciples, as two disciples.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.061
And you can see if you read their life,

00:05:32.262 --> 00:05:35.559
their character, their behavior, you’ll be surprised,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.199
how these two characters have been born again and again,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.640
in different times, to suggest two personalities

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.919
of two types, who have been seeking God,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.562
and who have been trying to understand God

00:05:50.763 --> 00:05:53.121
through their personality as disciples;

00:05:53.323 --> 00:05:56.599
and how they reached a conclusion

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.560
after taking a kind of a position in life.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.360
Now for example Buddha preached that

00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:07.159
there should be complete non-violence,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.626
and also Mahavira said so, there should be non-violence.

00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:14.160
But they carried it to such an extent.

00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.931
that Mahavira’s disciples started saving the bugs.

00:06:18.132 --> 00:06:21.243
They would get some bugs from the village,

00:06:21.498 --> 00:06:23.267
put them in a hut

00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:27.479
and put a Brahmin inside that – fanaticism at that stage -

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.580
and the bugs would eat,

00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:35.999
or take, take out the blood of that poor brahmin,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.319
and when they would be all filled with blood,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.359
then they would give money to this brahmin.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.079
Such extreme vegetarianism or extreme type of ahinsa!

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.998
Or another type of Buddha’s ahinsa that started

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.799
that Buddha was not the one who was a vegetarian,

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.520
because He died, at the end you know that,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.719
He ate the meat of a boar which was not properly cooked.

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:04.942
So this kind of extreme type of

00:07:05.143 --> 00:07:08.998
food-oriented religion started out of them,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.618
so they got themselves born again,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.957
as Hassan and Hussein and (unclear)

00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:21.718
that when it come to righteousness,

00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:25.611
when it comes to the (fight) for righteousness, you have to fight.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.102
That time the one who doesn't fight

00:07:28.324 --> 00:07:32.039
is not a person who is a religious person.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.907
So the idea of all these people was in such a way

00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:44.057
that the time at that period was such and such,

00:07:44.258 --> 00:07:48.359
and at that period this was the proper thing to be done.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.440
Now we can see the example of Christ is.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.312
Christ came at a time

00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:57.159
where the Son of God had to manifest.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.840
And He came at a time where He had to forgive,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.960
and He had to show to people how stupid they were, to crucify Him,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.960
so that they could repent for what stupidity they have done.

00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:15.320
And that’s how He came on this earth.

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:18.170
But when He will come again,

00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:21.199
He’s not going to come in that way.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.974
The Second Advent of Christ,

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:27.359
is going to be a very serious one.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.640
When He will come, He will have eleven destroying powers.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.999
With that He will destroy all that is useless,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.560
all that has gone wasted, all those fanatics

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.256
or "Whom they'll call Christ, Christ>>, I won’t know,

00:08:41.457 --> 00:08:42.920
He’s told that, very well.

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:46.360
All these things He’s going to absolutely finish off.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.280
And those who are realized souls,

00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.799
who have entered into the Kingdom of God, will be only saved.

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:57.560
And this is what is described in all the Scriptures.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.947
Of course somebody calls them, say Islam calls it “Mahdi”

00:09:02.148 --> 00:09:04.640
in India He is called as “Kalki”,

00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:08.320
in the Bible He is called as “the Christ on the white horse”.

00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:10.120
He is called by various names,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.840
but it is definite that He is going to come,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.485
and when He comes,

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:19.414
then He is not going to bother as to tell you, and convince you,

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:24.634
and to counsel you or to redeem you and give you Realization.

00:09:24.928 --> 00:09:27.999
That time, He is not going to bother about it.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.960
He is going to come in pure destructive form,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.771
where He will destroy all that is useless.

00:09:33.972 --> 00:09:38.483
And to understand this, if you see
the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo,

00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:41.640
you can see Him clearly standing, at the Agnya chakra,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.599
with a robust body, throwing people up and down.

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:47.320
Those who call, “Christ, Christ”, He throws them down,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.287
because they did not do anything what Christ has asked for.

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:54.898
Now the people should know

00:09:55.099 --> 00:09:58.160
what we have got out of anything whatsoever.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.880
You may be identified with any cult, with any idea,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.840
with any group, or anything,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.358
but always must know what you have you got out of it.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.719
For example, I would say for Christians it is necessary to know

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:14.720
that Christ has said a very strong thing,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.480
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.320
Let us find out, do we have innocent eyes?

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.638
If we don’t, we are not Christians.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.840
How do we have innocent eyes?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.998
How do we develop our innocence, is the problem.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.279
And to develop our innocence we have to awaken the Kundalini.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.465
When the Kundalini is awakened, the first center

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:40.799
of innocence is awakened.

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:46.319
At that time all the excretion work of the body just stops,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:53.014
and this center of Mooladhara, informs the Kundalini,

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:57.280
that “There is somebody who knows the job and You can rise.”

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.560
Then only the Kundalini rises.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.781
This center of innocence is first awakened within us.

00:11:03.983 --> 00:11:09.319
If this center finds that the person is anti-God,

00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:11.640
he is anti-Christ,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.120
he is a man who is a devil, or any sort of a thing,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.880
it just does not allow the Kundalini to rise.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.120
I have seen people with absolute frozen Kundalini;

00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:25.760
I have seen people who have nothing to do with Kundalini,

00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:27.925
we can say they are just like devils

00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:31.959
and they have no way that they can be realized.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.545
But ninety-nine percent people in this world

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.200
are excellent people, good people,

00:11:39.402 --> 00:11:41.680
and out of them I think at least

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.719
thirty to forty percent people are seeking God.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.320
Not all; some are seeking money, some are seeking power

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.680
and some are seeking some personal indulgences.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.600
But there are definitely true seekers on this earth,

00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:00.727
and this thirty percent people are, or forty percent people,

00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:04.319
are the most important people from the God’s point of view.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.120
You might be anything. You might be having any organization,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.799
you might be having any position in life,

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:14.560
you might be any great personality, makes no difference to God.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.999
What is important is that are you seeking?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.880
If you’re not, the door will be opened has been promised.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.400
But if you think you have already achieved it

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.439
and that you are there, how can it be worked out?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.960
So one has to be humble about it, and allow the Kundalini to rise

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.848
in Its own glory, giving you your real beauty.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.719
Now the thing we have to know that

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.999
as the Kundalini ascends, we also start getting powers.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.799
The first power is that of innocence.

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:55.107
Innocence has a power above all other powers.

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:57.319
It’s the most powerful thing,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.102
but in the human beings it takes time

00:13:00.303 --> 00:13:03.555
for innocence to be awakened in the full way.

00:13:03.756 --> 00:13:07.079
It takes time. As a child they have the innocence;

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.240
and in childhood, if they get their awakening

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.799
that’s the best thing that can happen to human beings

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:16.320
that in the childhood only they become, get their Realization.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.439
But as soon as you start growing

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.559
your attention starts going either to the left or to the right.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.520
You start indulging into all kinds of things

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.600
as far as your sex is concerned,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.408
as far as your seeking is concerned,

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:34.459
and you then jump on to some sort of a wrong thing

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.322
which you should not have done.

00:13:36.523 --> 00:13:39.172
And that’s how the first center gets lost.

00:13:39.373 --> 00:13:43.440
An innocent person is looked after by angels.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.622
Such a person has no fear of anything.

00:13:46.824 --> 00:13:50.930
He’s not bothered, he’s never violent, he’s never hasty,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.079
he’s never in a temper, he’s so peaceful,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.520
and he knows that what he is doing is the right thing.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.998
Such a person stands by righteousness.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.319
Like you can see in the life of Christ is a very good example

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.925
that when Mary Magdalene was stoned by people, He stood up,

00:14:11.127 --> 00:14:14.159
and He said, “Among you who has done no sin

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.999
can throw the stone at her.”

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.160
Actually Christ had nothing to do with a prostitute.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.920
He had no relationship of any kind with her.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.999
She is a prostitute and He is the Son of God.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.999
But at that time He did feel that she has a right to exist,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.080
because those who are stoning her

00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:36.760
are the people who have committed also sins.

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:40.799
Only she is a person who’s exposed, and He stood by her.

00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:43.572
And that is what happens to a person who is innocent

00:14:43.773 --> 00:14:44.958
he is fearless.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.880
He has no fear of anything,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.400
because he knows that he stands on truth and on innocence.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.600
Such a person also has a capacity to bear up lots of nonsense,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.520
to laugh at lots of tortures and troubles people bestow upon him.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.173
And the greatest thing of innocence is,

00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:07.279
that it gives you discretion.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.974
Such a person is immensely discreet. He’s so wise.

00:15:11.175 --> 00:15:14.359
He may be a little child, he may be a grown-up person,

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.479
he may be a villager, he might be educated,

00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:20.759
he might be uneducated, but he’s so wise

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.006
that he sees what is right and what is righteous.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.799
And this is the greatest quality of an innocent person,

00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:31.680
that he’s very discreet about everything.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.240
His discretion is just like a straight forward hit.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.519
He doesn’t have to think, he doesn’t have to bother.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.999
Whatever he decides is absolute discreet,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.079
and he doesn’t have to have choices.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.510
He doesn’t go on choosing people, he doesn’t go on choosing things.

00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:50.639
He said, “This is the thing” – finished.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.799
So, such a person becomes absolutely dynamic

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:57.799
because he doesn’t waste any energy, he doesn’t waste his brains,

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.880
he doesn’t waste his arguments with anyone.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.640
If he thinks a person is worth arguing, he’ll argue,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.399
otherwise he’ll say, “All right, you are clever. Go ahead.”

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.909
This is the understanding of a person,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.880
who is completely discreet.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.600
Like there was a very big joke about it, that

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.160
there was a man who was going up the road,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.159
up the stairs, and another one was coming downstairs.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.400
The one who was going up the road was a wise man

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.199
and the one who was coming down was not a wise man.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.519
So he tried to be aggressive, so, and he told him

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.279
that “I will not move for you, because I don’t move for fools.”

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.940
So the other one moved on one side and he said, “I do.”

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.480
Meaning, “I move out for fools,”

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.798
you see, but he said, “I do.” And he moved out.

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:57.119
So he has such a discretion – how far to go and how far not to go.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.360
Now, I will give you an example how

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.120
in nature you can find this very easily.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.479
See, the root has a little root cap.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.640
It’s a very, very small minute thing,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.799
you have to see through the microscope.

00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:12.725
Now this root cap is a wise thing.

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:16.329
It goes in the soil, it sees there are some stones,

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.118
so it goes around the stones.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:21.398
Then it finds there are boulders. It goes around the boulders.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.935
It has to find its way, so it's not bothered.

00:17:24.137 --> 00:17:25.839
“You are a boulder? All right, doesn’t matter,

00:17:26.047 --> 00:17:27.473
I am not going to fight with you.”

00:17:27.674 --> 00:17:31.069
It passes through that, it goes directly

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.080
to that place where it has to arrive,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.610
and when it reaches that place, when he arrives that place,

00:17:37.812 --> 00:17:41.332
what happens, he finds that he has tied up these boulders

00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:45.040
around himself to support the whole tree.

00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:50.720
This is the wisdom of a little bit, small little cell

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.840
which is the root-end.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.960
So you can imagine how much there is wisdom

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.799
in a little cell like that.

00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:04.960
And God has given us such a good brain

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.400
and if we do not have discretion

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.799
we are like people who are blind,

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:13.439
who walk without knowing where they have to go.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.720
So the first power of your innocence is awakened.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.560
Innocent men cannot be harmed.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.798
Those who try to harm the innocent men are harmed ultimately.

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:31.600
They are very severely harmed, and it is amazing sometimes

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.240
that the harm can be too much, too severe

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.360
and that’s why the compassion of Christ thought of it,

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.120
and He said, “Oh God, please forgive them,

00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:43.760
for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:45.999
Because it could have been that

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.960
with the Father who is so wrathful,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.799
they would have been all destroyed completely.

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:53.798
So the way He said, “Forgive them,

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.360
because I do not want

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.800
that these people, who are ignorant people,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.440
who have tortured Me like this, should be destroyed.”

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.450
This is the sign of innocence.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.039
Then the second chakra, when it is awaken within you,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.711
you have a special quality of creativity.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.799
Because when the second chakra is awaken,

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:24.888
you are actually thoughtless, there’s no thought in your mind.

00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:29.579
So you start looking at anything, without thinking.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.760
You start looking at anything that is created

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:38.279
without any ripple of thought in your mind.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.559
Like all that is created round the lake of your mind

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.928
is completely reflected in that ripple-less lake,

00:19:49.129 --> 00:19:54.799
and you see the complete reflection of that creation,

00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:59.799
as well as the joy that is bubbling in that creation.

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.799
So your creativity becomes tremendous.

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:06.382
You start seeing things, but not thinking about it.

00:20:06.583 --> 00:20:09.799
Now, see if you come to this hall,

00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:12.399
and you start seeing something, you like it,

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.320
then you start thinking, “Oh God, this is a beautiful thing,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.799
but how much it must have cost? And now how old it is?

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:21.999
Is it going to last or not? Is it insured or not?”

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.080
All sorts of funny ideas will come to you,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.264
and you’ll never enjoy what it is.

00:20:26.465 --> 00:20:28.879
But supposing you have no thought about it,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.799
you just watch it, you just see it.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.880
What happens? The creation that of the artist

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.919
who has created this beautiful thing,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.639
the joy of that creation that the artist had -

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.097
who might be dead now - you start enjoying that joy.

00:20:43.298 --> 00:20:48.097
The whole thing can be filled in you with that bubbling joy

00:20:48.298 --> 00:20:51.931
that he wanted to put there with his own heart.

00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:55.040
And that’s what happens because there is no thought.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.799
So the creativity becomes tremendous.

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:01.240
But it’s not only that the creativity is tremendous,

00:21:01.441 --> 00:21:02.999
but your techniques even.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.440
For example, a musician can become a tremendous musician.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.320
People who have never done any work, can become extremely powerful.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.399
We have somebody here from India.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.198
The other day he was telling people,

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.577
because he gave one of the lectures,

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.226
that “I had never seen what is wood is.

00:21:21.427 --> 00:21:24.799
I did not know what was teak, what was other wood and all that.”

00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:26.799
And he had no job when he came to Me.

00:21:26.999 --> 00:21:29.490
And he said, “Now, after Realization what job should I take?”

00:21:29.691 --> 00:21:32.202
I said, “You take to interior decoration”, and he got a shock.

00:21:32.403 --> 00:21:33.999
He said, “I don’t know what (to do).

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.867
How am I to take interior decoration?”

00:21:36.068 --> 00:21:38.280
I said, “You can start feeling the vibrations.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.160
You just do it on the basis on vibrations.”

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.999
And he did it, and he made a big money out of it,

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.120
because as I told you the other day,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.240
whatever is absolutely beautiful you think,

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.080
has nothing in it but has vibrations.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.399
It has a coefficient which gives you vibrations.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.040
Like Mona Lisa now. We like her, Mona Lisa.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.639
According to modern standards she cannot be a beauty

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.860
because she was a very plump lady, an elderly lady.

00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:07.560
But today also, if you go there, you cannot see her painting,

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.720
it’s so crowded, everybody’s anxious to see Mona Lisa.

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:12.799
And if you go and feel the vibrations,

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:14.799
from distance you’ll get vibrations,

00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:18.800
because the coefficients of her body, face and everything

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.999
is made so well, that you get the vibrations.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.998
Now people are very anxious to create new ideas,

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.287
new type of things, and these,

00:22:28.488 --> 00:22:30.714
but these things do not sell

00:22:30.915 --> 00:22:34.440
and even if they sell temporarily, they have no eternal values.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.320
So the people with this chakra enlightened,

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.935
start creating things of very eternal values,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.248
of universal values.

00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:49.463
Anywhere you take such a thing, you will take it to India,

00:22:49.664 --> 00:22:53.040
you take it to China, you take it to Japan or you take it to America

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.999
anywhere, any human being who sees that,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.799
sees the beauty of the Spirit,

00:23:00.999 --> 00:23:03.760
because it gives you joy in your Spirit.

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:07.799
So the pure art is produced (through you).

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:09.220
That’s the purity,

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:12.280
or I would say the holy art is produced through you.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.234
When you start producing that holy art, then you should believe

00:23:16.435 --> 00:23:20.799
that you have got an enlightenment on that chakra.

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:23.011
This chakra has another capacity,

00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:26.892
to transform your fat, for the use of your brain.

00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:30.880
And it works very hard for that, when you start thinking too much.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.922
And by that over thinking,

00:23:33.123 --> 00:23:35.566
what happens, that you develop all the diseases

00:23:35.767 --> 00:23:38.520
of the organs which it has to look after.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.760
Like, it has to look after the liver,

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:43.799
it has to look after the pancreas, it has to look after the spleen,

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:48.000
it has to look after the parts of the intestine and the uterus.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.967
So what happens that when you use this chakra

00:23:52.168 --> 00:23:55.879
only for the use of thinking and thinking and thinking,

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.360
all these things go out of order.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.615
And one by one you start developing diseases like diabetes,

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:07.434
and then you start developing diseases of the stomach,

00:24:07.635 --> 00:24:11.071
and sometimes the spleen, and all other diseases

00:24:11.272 --> 00:24:13.299
which are very dangerous, that the,

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.196
as you can call the blood cancer and all those things,

00:24:16.397 --> 00:24:18.759
out of this kind of mad thinking.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.040
Now to tell you that you shouldn’t think too much,

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.432
you shouldn’t bother too much, you should not be wobbly,

00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:28.226
you should take things easy, be light-hearted,

00:24:28.427 --> 00:24:30.274
is not possible in the modern times

00:24:30.426 --> 00:24:32.319
because we are slaves of the watch.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.679
But what happens, that when you get Realization,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.200
your thinking process becomes regulated.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.120
You only think when you have to think.

00:24:41.321 --> 00:24:43.799
You just go on thinking, thinking, like horns coming out.

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:47.119
You don’t think like that. You only think when you have to think.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.158
And whatever you think comes from you inspiration as such.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.120
Now for time, you see, My watch is always out of order.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.998
I deliberately keep it out of order, because the time is

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.040
in your hands.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.840
Supposing these people will hurry Me up too much,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.142
“Mother we have go now, we’ll miss
the plane, this thing, that thing.”

00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:12.131
I said, “All right, if you say I’ll go.”

00:25:12.332 --> 00:25:14.028
I go to the airport

00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:16.439
and there they find the plane is three hours late.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.799
Then they said, “Mother, why didn’t you tell us?”

00:25:18.999 --> 00:25:21.120
I said, “I was telling you, no need to hurry up.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.879
Why didn’t you telephone and find out?

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.240
If you had telephoned, we would not have been there earlier.”

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.256
So you see, you start seeing

00:25:29.457 --> 00:25:33.929
that this time is best for this, this time is best for that.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.411
You don’t have to become a slave of the watch.

00:25:36.612 --> 00:25:38.947
Like this, people become such slaves

00:25:39.148 --> 00:25:43.999
that they arrive at a point where there can be

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.240
some sort of a wrong thing happening

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.999
or maybe that you reach the place
and you have to wait for four hours,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.026
you have to do all kinds of arrangements

00:25:54.227 --> 00:25:55.938
to make yourself comfortable.

00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:59.080
Or sometimes it so happens that you quarrel with your wife,

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.471
quarrel with your husband, quarrel with your children,

00:26:01.672 --> 00:26:03.413
“Oh, we are getting late, we are getting late

00:26:03.614 --> 00:26:04.730
we have to be on the time.”

00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:06.798
All this madness comes to people

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:09.400
because they have not got their Realization.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.320
Once you get Realization, you station down.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.360
You are very much at ease with yourself.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.719
You don’t hurry others and you don’t trouble others.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.239
Like small, small things, how much we trouble by our worries.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.000
You see, human beings will go on saying, “I’m worried.”

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.920
But what’s the use of worrying? Now if I tell you, “Don’t worry”

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.304
you cannot stop it.

00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.520
But once the hole is made here,

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.720
which we call the Brahmarandhra is opened,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.280
then there’s a hole out of which the worry comes out,

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.520
and then you just cannot worry.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.760
Even if you want to worry, you won’t worry;

00:26:41.999 --> 00:26:46.800
because somehow or other you go beyond that nonsense of worrying.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.440
In any way, mentally I cannot convince you that you don’t worry.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.920
But once you get Realization, you’ll be amazed,

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.120
you’ll be just enjoying yourself.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.840
Even if you are late, you are not going to bother about

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.040
or trouble others and you will find

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.200
that you’ll be are always in time for things,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.160
because there is a force,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.680
this All Pervading Power of God looks after you.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.280
You start believing in it, how it works out.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.120
You won’t believe how much it helps,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.600
how much it works out, how it can operate

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.999
just beyond description.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.646
I mean, I’ll tell you a story which you won’t believe.

00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:26.635
Did I tell them yesterday about the boy who fainted?

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.559
SY: I don't think so, Mother.
SM: No.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.799
SM: A story about Myself,

00:27:30.999 --> 00:27:33.799
and then a story about Warren I can tell you.

00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:36.720
It’s in the newspaper, so you can believe it.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.200
I was giving a lecture in Bedford

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.480
and that was from seven to ten

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.240
and about eight o’clock a boy fell down somewhere,

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.799
about I don’t know ten-fifteen miles from a bridge.

00:27:48.999 --> 00:27:52.280
Very deep down he fell down from his motorbike.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.650
And they sent for an ambulance.

00:27:54.851 --> 00:27:57.170
They got frightened; they thought this boy must be dead,

00:27:57.371 --> 00:27:59.399
to fall down to this extent.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.800
So the ambulance came in and when the ambulance came in,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.160
this boy just walked up, and he came up

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.920
and he sat in the ambulance.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.799
So they said, “How are you?”

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:10.799
He said “I’m all right, nothing wrong with me.”

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:12.601
So they said, “But nothing happened to you.”

00:28:12.802 --> 00:28:14.480
He said, “No, I broke lots of things

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.086
but a Lady came in a white clothes,

00:28:17.287 --> 00:28:19.652
in a white Mercedes (that’s My car),

00:28:19.853 --> 00:28:22.999
and She walked down up to me and She cured me.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.040
And only She left the lower portion of my bone,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.480
and She said that, You come for this to Me,

00:28:30.681 --> 00:28:32.680
and the rest is I’m perfectly all right, see."

00:28:32.999 --> 00:28:34.720
They couldn’t believe it, you see.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.320
And the police was there, and everybody was there.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.447
And the next day he saw My photograph in the newspaper,

00:28:41.648 --> 00:28:43.520
and he informed them, he informed the police,

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:45.444
“This is the Lady Who came and cured me.”

00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:47.520
So they telephoned our people, and ask them,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.840
“Did She pass this way that day?”

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.240
They said, “That time She was just giving lecture

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.639
before six hundred people. She was not there.”

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.799
So they were quite amazed, how it has happened. But it can happen.

00:28:56.999 --> 00:28:59.240
It’s nothing new. I mean it has happened many a times.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.200
But one of these that has appeared in the newspaper is like that.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.999
Now, how does this happen?

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.640
God has got wonderful television also, perfect,

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.080
it’s so systematic, it’s so scientific.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.919
How it works, that for that you have to just see and wonder.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.719
He has got telecommunication, He has got computers,

00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:21.120
He has got everything that you have created,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.993
but extremely efficient and methodical.

00:29:25.194 --> 00:29:27.879
You don’t have to worry, it just works out.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.439
There are so many things that have happened,

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.720
like you have heard that Christ gave bread,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.799
five bread and fish to so many people.

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:39.240
It’s nothing new to now Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.999
They have seen this many a times happening,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.840
in our groups and in our camps.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.879
But another thing which is not believable

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.120
but it has happened to one Mr. Warren,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.998
Dr. Warren, who is here from Australia.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.799
When he came to India and he got his Realization,

00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:55.266
and when he went back he said,

00:29:55.425 --> 00:29:58.375
“I must now start talking about Sahaja Yoga

00:29:58.576 --> 00:30:00.160
and giving Realization to people.”

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.360
And when he went back to Australia there was a petrol crisis.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.439
And there was no petrol in his car, about to finish,

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.333
so they thought, “Now, what to do?

00:30:10.534 --> 00:30:13.080
We’ll not have any petrol. How to do Mother’s work?”

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.649
So they said, “Lets try.

00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:18.520
We’ll just go wherever we want, we’ll not look at the petrol.”

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.480
And they did this for twenty-one days, continuously,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.622
and when they went to the petrol pump after twenty-one days,

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:28.639
because the petrol pumps had opened out,

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.879
the petrol pump fellow said that,

00:30:31.081 --> 00:30:35.799
“There is hardly one liter space there. What am I to fill in?”

00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:39.280
And they were amazed, they did it twenty-one days. It can happen.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.798
You do not know when you say God is Almighty,

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:45.800
when we say that He can do whatever He wants to do.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.160
He does everything.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.880
When we say that we are not aware that what He can do.

00:30:51.152 --> 00:30:55.078
We just think that at the most He can make flowers into fruits,

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:57.799
at the most He can make our heart beat,

00:30:58.038 --> 00:31:01.879
at the most He can make us from amoeba to human being.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.799
But just think of it,

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:06.319
how far He can go,

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.560
and how capable He is

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.309
and how full of compassion He is for His own creation.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.400
Now you have to enter into that area.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.760
First of all, unless and until you are there,

00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:21.680
you are really blessed by God,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.069
you cannot believe it how it helps.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.999
Thirdly, the third center, is the center of your seeking,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.560
as he has told you, is the center of your seeking.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.680
Now the seeking gets satisfied

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.080
in the sense that you feel you are no more to seek,

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.000
now you have to give.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.600
You are asking for the light,

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.799
you have got the light, and you have to give the light.

00:31:50.999 --> 00:31:54.292
But you do not develop the fanatic attitude

00:31:54.493 --> 00:31:58.034
that, “I am the right person, and you are the wrong person”

00:31:58.236 --> 00:32:01.022
and that kind of a violent nature,

00:32:01.223 --> 00:32:04.760
but you develop a very gentle and a kindly

00:32:04.999 --> 00:32:07.200
and affectionate nature towards that person.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.040
Because you have gone through that kind of an experience,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.560
so you know that this person is ignorant.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.600
Gradually when he will see the light, he will understand.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.680
So you don’t force your way onto him, at all.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.877
On the contrary you allow that person to slowly

00:32:23.078 --> 00:32:27.639
take to it, and awaken his Kundalini and see for himself

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.680
so that he should certify himself.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.040
You don’t force him to say things,

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.876
you do not organize him,

00:32:34.077 --> 00:32:37.487
you do not make him a member,

00:32:37.688 --> 00:32:39.798
you do not take money from him, nothing.

00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:43.040
You leave him alone. If he wants to come, he can come.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.923
If he does not want to come, he need not come.

00:32:46.124 --> 00:32:49.120
In Sahaja Yoga, we have made it compulsory

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.959
that all the centers we are running,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.320
no young boys should come who are below age

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.080
without the permission of their parents,

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.480
even to visit, leave alone living there.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.040
So that, that’s how we allow only those people

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.599
who are grown up, adults, to come with their own wishes.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.132
They are not to be forced.

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:12.803
If they want to go today, we’ll say, “All right, go just now.”

00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:16.640
There is no compulsion on anyone,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.880
because one thing you must know, that you cannot compel

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.799
as far as your Self Realization is concerned.

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:24.880
Because it is of no use.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.840
It has to come through your freedom,

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.159
through your asking, otherwise we cannot work it out.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.120
Unless and until you ask for it, we cannot do it,

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.600
it is an impossibility.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.966
So you must understand that

00:33:39.157 --> 00:33:41.992
I cannot force you to get Realization.

00:33:42.193 --> 00:33:43.480
It has to work out.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.534
If it works out, you are a lucky person. I cannot guarantee it.

00:33:47.735 --> 00:33:50.679
If it works out that means it is your own,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.280
and if it has not worked out and if you want to work Me out

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.920
or anybody to work it out, they’ll work it out.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.799
But it cannot be guaranteed, it cannot be promised.

00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:04.200
So your seeking stops and what happens

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.869
that you start looking at yourself

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.523
and seeing your own glory,

00:34:10.714 --> 00:34:13.719
and understanding your own powers,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.960
get yourself cleaned out,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:21.013
and you want to give others that solace that you have got,

00:34:21.214 --> 00:34:23.560
that Realization that you have got.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.120
So, I always say that I’m the greatest capitalist,

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.695
because if I have all the powers I’m the greatest capitalist,

00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:32.799
and I’m the greatest communist

00:34:32.998 --> 00:34:35.600
because I cannot live without distributing you.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.720
I must distribute. When we talk of capitalism,

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.998
what do you have? These stones? What do you have?

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.879
What do you distribute? The stones?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.840
And what are you a communist? What are you distributing?

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.239
Only stones.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.998
So there is nothing to be proud of these worldly possessions.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:51.879
What you are to be proud of,

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.159
or to be conscious of, is your Spirit.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.320
Spirit is the only thing that can kindle another Spirit.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.799
I have not seen any matter can kindle that joy in anyone.

00:35:03.999 --> 00:35:07.287
At the most if you give some matter to somebody, at the most,

00:35:07.488 --> 00:35:10.814
that is the only advantage of having some material thing is

00:35:11.015 --> 00:35:12.558
that you can give away,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.080
that you can express your love through some material things.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.320
But otherwise the matter has no value of any kind.

00:35:19.999 --> 00:35:22.200
But Spirit has absolute value,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.440
because it can kindle light into another’s life,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.960
and there cannot be anything better than to be given to anyone else.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.200
No amount of money, no amount of empires,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.080
nothing can give that which is the Spirit,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.360
because the Spirit is the ultimate.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.007
After that you don’t seek anything.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.720
That’s what is the Kundalini, is the true desire

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.800
which wants to become the reality,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.799
which wants to become the divinity.

00:35:50.999 --> 00:35:54.160
To get divinity within you is the highest thing,

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.160
and that’s what once you get,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.760
you don’t want anything else.

00:35:58.999 --> 00:36:01.640
So the seeking starts improving.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.679
Around the seeking are the Ten Commandments, you can say,

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.182
or the ten primordial masters.

00:36:07.383 --> 00:36:10.600
There are many others, but the primordial masters, the ten,

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.799
who came on this earth, one after another,

00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:14.984
to teach us how to balance ourselves.

00:36:15.185 --> 00:36:18.279
After Realization I’ve seen people automatically balance.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.040
I don’t tell them anything about Ten Commandments.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.400
I don’t say “Don’t”, I never say.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.386
I said, “You get your Realization.”

00:36:25.588 --> 00:36:28.798
Once they get Realization they just start

00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:32.799
behaving in such a manner that is extremely righteous,

00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:36.759
extremely balanced, extremely holy.

00:36:36.999 --> 00:36:39.399
Such a person becomes immediately

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.160
rid of all the horrible habits they have,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.587
all the enslavement of passion, and lust and greed.

00:36:49.788 --> 00:36:51.519
Everything drops out just like that,

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:57.131
and like a beautiful lotus they come out of that mire,

00:37:00.478 --> 00:37:02.799
that darkness, into light.

00:37:02.999 --> 00:37:07.038
And then in the light they see it so clearly,

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.359
that this is not the thing that I can have,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.799
this is not the thing that I can wear,

00:37:12.999 --> 00:37:14.720
and immediately they give it up.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.560
That’s how you become a new personality.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.826
This religion is born within you.

00:37:20.027 --> 00:37:23.370
Now we talk of religion, this religion that religion, that religion.

00:37:23.571 --> 00:37:25.319
Everybody is talking of different religions

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.920
and dogmas, and this and that,

00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:29.120
and only fighting everywhere you go.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.720
They are fighting among each other, it’s still going on.

00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:35.439
It’s endless; they are all fighting morning till evening.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.440
Then I have seen also some people who try to unite religions

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.919
and there also they have nothing but all the devils put together,

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.799
all devils joined together to unite.

00:37:43.999 --> 00:37:46.240
There is nothing of reality in them.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.999
So the people are puzzled, “What is happening to religion?”

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.520
These organized religions also can be very dangerous.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.600
They can put you into such norms that you can really

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.520
get absolutely brain-washed,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.320
and you start believing that what you are doing is correct,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.120
without understanding why are you doing it.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.560
Most of the things tell, “This is a mystery, that is a mystery.”

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.360
Then why, what are you doing there?

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.397
If it is a mystery, it is better you give up.

00:38:12.598 --> 00:38:15.291
But they’ll just brand you that “This is mystery, that is mystery”.

00:38:15.492 --> 00:38:16.679
You have to accept.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.920
But what is the advantage of that kind of a life,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.319
nobody wants to see.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.759
As I told you, that Christ has asked for one thing,

00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:26.600
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.729
and let us see which religious organization

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.520
has granted that to people.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.975
It’s only your Spirit, when It is awakened and reborn,

00:38:37.176 --> 00:38:39.239
you can have that innocence within you.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.640
As it is today, it’s getting late,

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.160
but I have to tell you that the chakras

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.720
as he explained, I am just giving you the powers of every chakra.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:55.746
And the power of the chakra of heart is tremendous.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.499
It gives you the fearlessness.

00:39:01.188 --> 00:39:03.840
When the child is about twelve years of age,

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.798
in this sternum bone, the antibodies are created by this chakra.

00:39:08.999 --> 00:39:11.134
And they are sent all over the body

00:39:11.335 --> 00:39:15.798
to fight the disease or any kind of an attack on the personality.

00:39:16.068 --> 00:39:20.880
Now, these are actually looked after by the deity in that center,

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.640
and this deity, when gets the message,

00:39:25.999 --> 00:39:31.799
She informs all the antibodies that “You have to fight.”

00:39:31.999 --> 00:39:35.649
And all of them will go at that point, join together,

00:39:35.851 --> 00:39:39.999
to fight the enemy of life, enemy of God.

00:39:40.621 --> 00:39:44.439
Like now we are having, now I’m here,

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.999
and Americans are to be realized,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.759
and we have to do something about America.

00:39:50.999 --> 00:39:54.319
Then knowing that how America is important -

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.798
I’ll tell you where America is in this body -

00:39:57.999 --> 00:40:01.600
people from Australia, from India,

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:05.359
from France, from all over,

00:40:05.999 --> 00:40:07.999
have come down here.

00:40:08.819 --> 00:40:11.000
All the way they have come,

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.039
just to give Realization to Americans.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.919
All of them. I never forced anybody, I never asked anybody,

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.880
they just came forward, “Mother, we are going to go with You,

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.754
and we are going to do this great work of Realization

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:28.359
to people of America who are seekers.”

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.840
They all have come on their own, spending their own money,

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.105
and they are doing this work with Me.

00:40:34.306 --> 00:40:40.804
So you can image what a great attraction it must be,

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:45.200
what a great attachment it must be, for the seekers of America,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.760
that they have come all the way. They are all people on big jobs

00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:51.928
one is a doctor, another is an architect, another is this,

00:40:52.129 --> 00:40:55.799
all of them sacrificing their money, everything, time

00:40:55.999 --> 00:40:59.718
have come down here to be with Me for these two months

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.130
to work for America, from all over.

00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:04.847
We have some people who are actresses

00:41:05.048 --> 00:41:11.129
in the English drama

00:41:11.331 --> 00:41:14.360
or some are directors and things like that.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.080
They all have come here.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.960
In your Boston we have at least,

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.799
I think, ten people from ten countries.

00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:26.788
So you can imagine how is the whole attention, the priority.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:30.160
This is the important thing. They must get Realization.

00:41:30.451 --> 00:41:32.520
They do not get any money out of it;

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.799
they do not get any reward out of it,

00:41:34.999 --> 00:41:38.919
only the satisfaction that so many have got Realization.

00:41:39.234 --> 00:41:42.360
The more, the merrier. When they see more people coming

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.798
getting Realization, you must see their faces, they lit up.

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:49.240
This kind of a personality people have not seen.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.399
I had one bishop

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.558
who came to stay with Me in My house in London,

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.960
and when he saw Sahaja Yogis, he said,

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.999
“This is a rare caste and community. I have never seen such a...

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.240
So I’ve been telling people to do little things

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.880
in life, they cannot do it and look at these people,

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.160
how beautiful they are. I can’t believe how can they be so nice.”

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.560
Because your Spirit is beautiful,

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.600
the Spirit is glorious,

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.640
and when you become that,

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.920
automatically it starts manifesting its beauty.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.999
You don’t have to tell yourself, you’ll be amazed at yourself

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.359
how you have become so beautiful,

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.920
and so good and so nice.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.560
So this quality of fearlessness comes to you

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.799
because your antibodies

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:38.359
are completely charged with the power of the Spirit.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.080
And you start understanding what sort of a disease is coming,

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.560
what sort of an attack is coming,

00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:46.923
and your body knows how to fight it.

00:42:47.124 --> 00:42:50.240
You know how to fight it, and when you know that,

00:42:50.441 --> 00:42:52.631
you are not afraid of any disease whatsoever,

00:42:52.832 --> 00:42:54.279
even it is cancer, anything,

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.159
people know how to fight it themselves and for others.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.439
Now the higher chakra is of Vishuddhi chakra

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.920
and this chakra is what America is.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.359
In the Universe this is the chakra,

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.938
Vishuddhi chakra, is what America represents.

00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:16.520
Because America has a responsibility,

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.664
this center has the responsibility.

00:43:18.905 --> 00:43:21.307
When they raise the head,

00:43:23.177 --> 00:43:25.920
human beings, then this center developed

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.028
the responsibility to be human beings.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.799
And the responsibility of spirituality

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:35.823
lies on the shoulders of Americans.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.970
You had great people like Abraham Lincoln,

00:43:41.171 --> 00:43:45.399
very great people here professing about

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.200
freedom of your country and big ideal things.

00:43:50.563 --> 00:43:54.240
But to My dismay I find: where are those gone?

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.110
Where are those people

00:43:56.311 --> 00:43:59.040
who will take the responsibility of spirituality?

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.320
They are lost with fake gurus, they are lost with cults,

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.679
they are lost with all kinds of things and where are they?

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.999
It’s such a sad thing that the responsibility

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.279
which was on the shoulders of Americans

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.480
has been not properly tackled, at all.

00:44:16.681 --> 00:44:19.920
But now the time is – though we start slowly,

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.240
let us take up the responsibility and see for ourselves,

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.799
what we can do for our countrymen, for our people,

00:44:26.999 --> 00:44:29.399
and on the hole for the whole world.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.839
You can do a lot, because that is your specialty

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.232
that is your job, which has to be done.

00:44:36.999 --> 00:44:41.040
Now this chakra gives you the power to be the witness.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.080
First power you get that you become the witness

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.480
– witness of everything. The whole thing becomes like a drama,

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.319
like you are in the water, and then you suddenly come in a boat

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.400
and you start seeing the play of all these waves.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.386
You are no more afraid, you just start seeing it as a drama;

00:44:58.588 --> 00:44:59.973
you become a witness.

00:45:00.174 --> 00:45:02.448
The second thing that happens to you with this,

00:45:02.649 --> 00:45:04.960
that you become collectively conscious.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:09.359
Your hands, if this chakra is good, start feeling the cool breeze,

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.719
start feeling the chakras of yourself and chakras of other people.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.239
With your hands you can cure people,

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.560
with your hands you can raise the Kundalini,

00:45:18.761 --> 00:45:20.480
with your hands you can give Realization.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.642
These hands become powerful things.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.160
Even the movement of these hands has a meaning;

00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:29.167
everything has a meaning.

00:45:29.368 --> 00:45:32.999
Whatever it does, little fingers, they all have a meaning

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.319
and because they get enlightened.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.680
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

00:45:37.881 --> 00:45:41.288
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:45:42.296 --> 00:45:45.439
Now if you talk to any Muslims,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.038
they will say, “We have never heard of Resurrection day.”

00:45:49.239 --> 00:45:51.225
Find in the Koran, if you see,

00:45:51.426 --> 00:45:53.928
most of it is dealt with the resurrection day,

00:45:54.129 --> 00:45:57.189
and the doomsday is very little.

00:45:57.813 --> 00:45:59.999
But people will talk about the doomsday

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.520
because they can frighten others with that

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.080
and have their own cults and own things.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.680
But actually the resurrection day is the most important thing.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.145
And for which Mohammed Sahib has clearly said the future.

00:46:14.346 --> 00:46:17.320
He didn’t say that, “I’m the last, now nothing is going to happen.”

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.960
He said, “At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.”

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.960
And that’s exactly what happens,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.359
that you start feeling others on your fingertips.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.404
You know through your fingertips

00:46:29.606 --> 00:46:33.320
what centers are catching in another person or in yourself also,

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.200
and immediately you start improving it, if you know how to do it.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.480
And that’s what you have to learn: is the divine technique,

00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:46.276
the true knowledge, of how to handle this power of Divine Love,

00:46:46.477 --> 00:46:48.576
that is flowing through you.

00:46:49.067 --> 00:46:52.799
So this center is very important, I think, for Americans.

00:46:52.999 --> 00:46:56.839
It has one side by which people are aggressive.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.054
When they talk they’re bumptious, they are ego oriented,

00:47:02.255 --> 00:47:04.600
they try to suppress others by their speeches

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.319
and try to dominate others when they talk

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.253
– these are the right sided people.

00:47:09.454 --> 00:47:12.880
The other side are the left sided people when they feel guilty,

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.560
they think they have done this wrong, and that wrong,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.320
they should not have done this wrong.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.360
Actually I’ve seen that in America

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.640
most of the people have problems here, most surprising,

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.591
They are all the time shaking their neck like this, all the time.

00:47:25.792 --> 00:47:28.960
In My program also I’ve seen, they have always a problem here.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.480
The thing is that they have a greater responsibility

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.383
to keep this center the best,

00:47:34.578 --> 00:47:37.348
by keeping the responsibility of spirituality

00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:40.799
quite the highest priority.

00:47:40.999 --> 00:47:43.200
They should have the highest priority.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.805
But what you find that all the people are coming

00:47:46.006 --> 00:47:48.199
from all over the world to help the Americans.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.765
A day should come when the Americans should go all over the world

00:47:51.966 --> 00:47:53.160
to give Realization.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.545
And I’m sure that day will come one day

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.384
when you will grow up to that sense of responsibility

00:47:58.585 --> 00:48:01.203
when this center will really stand up,

00:48:01.404 --> 00:48:03.802
as a spiritual personality.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.341
Now, the higher center is of Agnya chakra which

00:48:08.543 --> 00:48:13.101
he has told you about, is the center when you get Realization,

00:48:13.302 --> 00:48:15.439
and when the Kundalini rises above that,

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.497
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:48:18.953 --> 00:48:23.879
Now at this time you get the power first of all of curing people.

00:48:24.152 --> 00:48:25.920
If you touch somebody, he’s cured.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.920
If you say something, that happens.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.319
If you go in the house, something good comes in that house.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.757
Auspiciousness starts working through you,

00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:35.311
when this center is opened.

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:37.280
But one should not leave at that center,

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.503
because if you start moving onto the left, or to the right,

00:48:40.704 --> 00:48:42.519
you'll get into problems.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.520
If that center starts moving onto the right,

00:48:45.721 --> 00:48:48.760
then you start seeing visions, which is a very wrong thing.

00:48:48.999 --> 00:48:51.078
You go into the realm of supra-conscious

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.120
or into the collective supra-conscious,

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.760
by you can become a very ego oriented person.

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:59.798
You can be a very violent, hot tempered, quarrelsome person.

00:48:59.999 --> 00:49:02.120
Actually, Hitler used this.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.840
Hitler used this method from the lamas he learnt,

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.799
and he put people onto the right side of the supraconscious,

00:49:09.999 --> 00:49:13.678
into collective supraconscious and put the spirits, dead spirits,

00:49:13.879 --> 00:49:19.160
who were of the people who were extremely ambitious and cruel.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.799
That’s how this cruelty came into the Germans

00:49:21.961 --> 00:49:23.884
and they forgot what they were.

00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:25.560
They forgot they were human beings,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.799
the way they killed, the way they behaved,

00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:30.480
it’s impossible for any human being to do that.

00:49:30.681 --> 00:49:32.779
But he managed this, and is written down

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.120
that he got all this from lamas from Tibet.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.799
From there he got the knowledge how to put people

00:49:39.999 --> 00:49:42.439
onto the collective supraconscious.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.920
Now the people who can go to the left side,

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.440
also start curing people, they start...

00:49:49.776 --> 00:49:52.480
In such a company you might just get stunned.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.160
If you face such a person you might just get stunned.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:01.919
Or you might get a kind of a complete attraction for such a person

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.279
You might get completely under the domination of such a person.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.960
You might surrender completely to such a person,

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.874
and you will not know what you are doing,

00:50:10.075 --> 00:50:12.374
till that person has completely destroyed you.

00:50:12.575 --> 00:50:15.399
This type of people have these horrible powers

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.040
because they enter into the collective subconscious.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.582
And when they enter into the collective subconscious,

00:50:20.783 --> 00:50:24.920
they gather those spirits, which they use.

00:50:25.764 --> 00:50:29.799
But the people, who as it is, move to the left side,

00:50:29.999 --> 00:50:35.160
who cry, weep, emotional, feel guilty all the time

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.520
miserable people, they jump onto the left side.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.612
Now all the diseases, practically most of them,

00:50:41.813 --> 00:50:45.567
like AIDS, like cancer, like myelitis.

00:50:45.768 --> 00:50:48.560
All these diseases come from the left sided entry

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.840
and is accepted by the doctors;

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.680
because I’ve seen a very good film made by the doctors,

00:50:53.881 --> 00:50:55.399
who were researching on cancer,

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.480
that when the body is vulnerable to these diseases,

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.640
means when you are over-exerting yourself,

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.240
when there is too much of sympathetic activity in a person,

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.720
and when a person is absolutely fagged out with it,

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.061
at that time, they say,

00:51:12.262 --> 00:51:14.614
that these diseases are triggered into you,

00:51:14.757 --> 00:51:16.279
that somebody triggers it.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.090
And what is this they call, is the protein 52, and protein 58,

00:51:21.291 --> 00:51:23.542
and all these names they give because doctors don’t know

00:51:23.743 --> 00:51:25.011
that they are dead spirits.

00:51:25.213 --> 00:51:27.787
And these are the things when they enter into you

00:51:27.988 --> 00:51:29.136
then they trigger it.

00:51:29.338 --> 00:51:31.134
But they say something very right,

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.298
and that is that these things come

00:51:33.499 --> 00:51:36.471
from the area built in you since your creation,

00:51:36.672 --> 00:51:39.291
means your collective subconscious.

00:51:39.674 --> 00:51:41.720
And that I have been saying for so many years.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.559
Now recently I saw this film.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.560
So they are coming to the same point, but after such a long time,

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.480
that it is triggered by them.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.439
So those people who go too much to the left get this trouble.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:59.359
Those who go too much to the right get heart trouble, heart attacks;

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.519
but not the slow attack, because heart has double type of attacks,

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.959
it can a be slow heart or it can be a fast heart.

00:52:07.229 --> 00:52:09.960
The people who go on the right side have everything fast,

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.720
liver is moving fast, everything moving fast,

00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:15.968
it’s such a speedy temperament because they are so speedy.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:18.772
In the morning they’ll get up, “Now I have to go to the office”

00:52:18.915 --> 00:52:21.231
and they’ll be taking the breakfast in one hand,

00:52:21.432 --> 00:52:23.850
putting one foot in the trousers,

00:52:24.052 --> 00:52:27.280
and another hand into the coat, running to the car,

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.200
and there's a big another jam coming up

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.798
and then swearing at everything and it’s a mess throughout.

00:52:33.999 --> 00:52:35.680
And the whole body gets messed up.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.313
And when the whole body gets messed up,

00:52:38.424 --> 00:52:40.774
then what happens, that your speedometer

00:52:40.975 --> 00:52:43.319
which is the spleen also goes out of order

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.200
and you develop a funny type of temperament.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.960
If you say them that, “We have to go now to the airport”

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.520
you see them absolutely gone as they are wobbly.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.799
The whole machine goes off, you don’t know why,

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.169
if you ask them, “What’s the …?” “Oh! I have to go to the airport.”

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.440
So what? Even the name of the airport can put people like that.

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.120
So they become absolutely uneasy people,

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:08.560
and this kind of thing when happens, you see, you are in for trouble

00:53:08.761 --> 00:53:10.556
you are very much in for trouble.

00:53:10.763 --> 00:53:13.181
And this is to be balanced and put right

00:53:13.382 --> 00:53:15.943
through your Kundalini awakening.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.279
Now this center as you know, is the most important center

00:53:19.481 --> 00:53:22.999
because this is the gate to the Kingdom of God,

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.158
and is governed by our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.799
who is the embodiment of innocence.

00:53:28.999 --> 00:53:33.136
Here He does not incarnate, there He incarnates on this earth.

00:53:33.337 --> 00:53:37.868
Now, His crucifixion was fixed, and He was to be crucified

00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:42.853
to show that He is eternal life, which does not die.

00:53:43.054 --> 00:53:46.279
He is Chaitanya; He is made of all these vibrations.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.680
So He could walk on the water also,

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:53.721
and He could pass through that tight closeness

00:53:53.935 --> 00:53:59.199
of these two balloon-like structures, ego and superego,

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:03.160
and could settle there to establish that center for us,

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.400
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.319
which controls your ego and superego, both.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.240
But most surprising, the people who are, say, Catholics

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.680
are the people who use their superego.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.040
They get conditioned very much, this should not be done,

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:24.760
confessions, weeping, crying, unhappy...

00:54:24.999 --> 00:54:26.479
"We have to be miserable"… Why?

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.439
Christ has been crucified for you. He has suffered for you.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.480
Why? If you have accepted Christ, you should be joyous.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.191
Only to be awakened Christ,

00:54:35.374 --> 00:54:38.772
so that you get your Realization, that’s all. What is there to cry?

00:54:38.973 --> 00:54:41.799
If they are, say Protestants and all that...

00:54:41.999 --> 00:54:43.879
I took My birth in Protestant religion,

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.840
and many Hindus and Muslims ask Me,

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.799
“Mother, why did You take Your birth in Protestant religion?”

00:54:48.999 --> 00:54:51.799
So I said, “They are very sophisticated fanatics,

00:54:51.999 --> 00:54:53.799
because they rationalize everything.

00:54:53.999 --> 00:54:56.799
They rationalize God, they rationalize every dogma, everything

00:54:56.999 --> 00:54:58.799
it’s such a thinking going on there,

00:54:58.999 --> 00:55:01.279
So it is very difficult to push them back,

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.679
that God is not thinking, God is beyond thought,

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.360
God is beyond your mind. Mind is limited.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.004
You have to go beyond that,

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:12.319
and that’s why Christ crossed that limit by His resurrection.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.991
So His message is His resurrection

00:55:15.165 --> 00:55:19.420
and His resurrection has given us a special quality,

00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:21.417
that once He is awakened within us,

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:24.680
the both these ego and superego are sucked in by Him.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.840
That means He died for our sins,

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.480
so that He sucked our sins, our karmas,

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.895
everything sucked in and this opens out.

00:55:32.096 --> 00:55:35.040
Once this opens out, the Kundalini comes out.

00:55:35.241 --> 00:55:37.799
And this is what He has done such a great work

00:55:37.999 --> 00:55:39.560
that He has died for our sins

00:55:39.747 --> 00:55:42.250
and when He is awakened,

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.934
both these institutions are sucked in,

00:55:46.135 --> 00:55:48.000
and you become

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.960
egoless, superegoless,

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.799
you become de-conditioned automatically.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.999
Now this great incarnation was called as Mahavishnu

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.799
and is described in the ancient books

00:56:01.999 --> 00:56:05.238
about fourteen thousand years back, by Markandeya.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.799
But people could not relate it to that,

00:56:07.999 --> 00:56:09.799
because when Christians went from here,

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.503
they went in a different mode, it was a political stunt.

00:56:12.704 --> 00:56:15.798
You see, they carried a gun in one hand and a Bible in another hand.

00:56:15.999 --> 00:56:18.913
Such people could not communicate with other people,

00:56:19.115 --> 00:56:20.756
who had everything with them,

00:56:20.957 --> 00:56:24.160
and they never read those books to them, it was all prohibited.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.560
Bible is too small a book to contain a character like Christ.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.536
He was too great a man,

00:56:30.737 --> 00:56:32.798
and we should have gone all out to see

00:56:32.999 --> 00:56:35.040
what He’s described in other scriptures,

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.160
how He’s talked about, let us find out.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.160
We should have been open minded about it.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.800
Instead of that people just laughed

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.365
and mocked at all these old books, the Scriptures,

00:56:45.566 --> 00:56:47.087
and they thought they are the wisest.

00:56:47.289 --> 00:56:50.720
This is the worst part is that the ego thinks they are the highest,

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.920
they are the best, they can do what they like

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.560
and that is how they lived.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.760
But thank God, now, people are realizing

00:56:57.999 --> 00:57:01.319
that we have missed the point, we have definitely missed the point.

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.793
So we have to see what He was

00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:06.960
before He came on this earth,

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:11.799
in the Heaven, how He was created, how He was Alpha and Omega,

00:57:11.999 --> 00:57:15.399
what was His own nature, for what purpose He came,

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.560
and why He died, why He was resurrected,

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.039
why this drama was to be carried out?

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.240
For this, only three and a half years of Christ cannot explain,

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.920
and people cannot tell us why all these things happened.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.799
We have to keep a very open mind about Christ,

00:57:31.999 --> 00:57:35.359
and we have to see with our own eyes how it works out.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.799
In Kundalini awakening you’ll be surprised,

00:57:37.999 --> 00:57:39.799
when the Kundalini stops here,

00:57:39.999 --> 00:57:41.866
and this chakra is closed,

00:57:42.067 --> 00:57:45.999
then you have to say the Lord’s prayer, everywhere,

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.360
whether you are a Jew, you are a Muslim,

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.720
you are a Hindu or a Christian.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.799
From whatever community you become a yogi,

00:57:53.999 --> 00:57:57.359
you become a realized soul, you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.111
because the Kundalini won’t rise,

00:57:59.312 --> 00:58:03.960
and that is the one of the greatest proof

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.879
that Christ resides here.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.400
If you do not say the Lord’s Prayer, it doesn’t work out.

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.839
So Lord’s Prayer is a mantra, is a chanting,

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.316
but is to be said by a person who is a realized soul,

00:58:14.517 --> 00:58:15.879
who is authorized for you.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.080
Otherwise it is called as anadhikar cheshta,

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.159
means the person who has no right,

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.920
is trying to do something, is doing a wrong thing.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.999
So those who are realized souls, when they say

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.799
this mantra, then this center is opened up,

00:58:29.999 --> 00:58:32.399
Christ is awakened, and you are allowed

00:58:32.636 --> 00:58:35.581
to see, allow your Kundalini to pass through it

00:58:35.782 --> 00:58:39.799
and enter into the realm of this limbic area

00:58:39.999 --> 00:58:46.999
where is one thousand petaled Lotus remains.

00:58:47.494 --> 00:58:50.360
Now these petals then open up,

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.799
because of the pressure being reduced

00:58:53.999 --> 00:58:55.669
of the ego and super ego,

00:58:55.870 --> 00:59:00.920
and they are in different beautiful colored flames.

00:59:01.194 --> 00:59:04.880
The outside starts with a just like

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.984
from vibgyor if you take it, from

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.279
Vibgyor in the same way they start, but very slowly moving

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.293
and the end ones are like crystal, crystal,

00:59:15.494 --> 00:59:17.440
absolutely like crystal, they’re shinning.

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.759
And when the Kundalini comes out of it

00:59:19.999 --> 00:59:23.520
you see the whole thing opened out, the whole chakra opens out.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.080
This is a very important center which has to be opened out

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.040
because here all the seven centers are there.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.869
For example, we have got here at the back,

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:37.654
if you start here, from here if you start, is the Mooladhara,

00:59:37.855 --> 00:59:40.365
and then around it is the Swadisthana,

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:43.765
and here is the Nabhi, and then it is the Heart.

00:59:43.966 --> 00:59:47.310
See now. This is the hole which has to open,

00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:48.856
and this is the Heart,

00:59:49.057 --> 00:59:52.799
means if there is a dirty heart,

00:59:52.999 --> 00:59:55.999
if there is a closed heart, if it is a tired heart,

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.718
if there is a sick heart, then this doesn’t open.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.760
So in the heart resides the Spirit,

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.319
and that’s why this is the seat of the Spirit,

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.080
but it resides in the heart.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.440
So when this opens out,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.946
this flower-like lotus opens out,

01:00:15.169 --> 01:00:18.080
then the Kundalini rises in Her own glory,

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.720
and you get your Realization, as you got it.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.880
Now as I told you, it is the beginning.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.799
In the Bible it is said,

01:00:25.999 --> 01:00:28.799
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

01:00:29.007 --> 01:00:31.502
and you can see it. I see it every day,

01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:33.560
the beautiful tongues of flames.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.160
But you can’t see it because you are in it.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.079
Whatever you see, you are not, so you have to first become.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.880
Once you become and you grow into that,

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.480
then you can also start seeing, but just now you have to become.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.718
Supposing you see the light, means you are not the light.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.880
If you see anything, you are not that.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.235
So the question is of becoming, of actualizing and growing into it

01:00:57.436 --> 01:01:00.040
and knowing about everything that you do,

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.120
Everything should be knowledgeable and should be understood,

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.999
should be logical.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.880
I hope it works out in this place.
I have told you all about chakras.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.799
Tomorrow what to do after Self Realization I’ll tell you.

01:01:13.934 --> 01:01:16.090
And we'll have another session here in this hall,

01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:17.661
luckily we have got it,

01:01:17.862 --> 01:01:20.430
and we have decided to have one more program tomorrow.

01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:23.480
I hope it will be nice tomorrow and it won’t rain so much.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.279
So call all your friends. I will tell you what’s to be done

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.076
after Realization, what is the situation.

01:01:29.277 --> 01:01:32.480
So, may God bless you. Thank you.

01:01:36.032 --> 01:01:37.640
SY: Friday night, Shri Mataji.

01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:39.792
SM: We have tomorrow.
SY: Friday, Friday.

01:01:39.943 --> 01:01:43.944
SM: I'm sorry. I don't know, whatever it is, you tell them.

01:01:57.769 --> 01:02:00.720
Like yesterday you have to do. We'll do it again today

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.600
and it will work out I'm sure.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.039
Like yesterday we have to put our hands on our lap just like this,

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.799
in a very comfortable way.

01:02:09.999 --> 01:02:11.959
First of all, we must sit comfortably.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.799
There should be no discomfort and that is distractive.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.799
So just seat very comfortable.

01:02:17.999 --> 01:02:21.959
And everyone should do it. There is nothing special or anything,

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.524
but you must try to do it and achieve it

01:02:24.651 --> 01:02:26.799
because is not proper not to do it.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.691
When there is a chance you must do it,

01:02:28.892 --> 01:02:31.799
and it won't be good for others also if you don't want to do it.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:35.879
It's nothing, nothing too much for you to do it, it's very simple.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.319
So put your left hands towards Me like this

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.839
and the right hand you have to use,

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.592
because the left hand is the power of desire

01:02:43.772 --> 01:02:46.708
and the right hand is the power of action.

01:02:46.909 --> 01:02:48.998
And as I told you yesterday,

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:52.840
that in a village of 6000 people I did not do anything like that.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.360
Just when I stand up they get Realization

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.999
because they are very simple people in a village.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.031
But here people are quite complicated, they have problems:

01:03:01.232 --> 01:03:04.678
self-created, society-generated,

01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:07.558
the atmosphere generated, all sorts of things are there.

01:03:07.802 --> 01:03:10.390
Doesn’t matter. So we have to little bit nourish

01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:14.298
our different centers, which is a very easy thing to do,

01:03:14.498 --> 01:03:17.988
and I, as I told you, you try to follow it.

01:03:18.188 --> 01:03:20.864
Now, you have to close your eyes,

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:24.165
and not to open your eyes because of the Agya Chakra.

01:03:24.366 --> 01:03:25.420
That’s very important.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.274
Because if your eyes are opened

01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:30.457
I find it difficult to raise your Kundalini.

01:03:30.657 --> 01:03:32.647
You have to keep your eyes completely closed,

01:03:32.847 --> 01:03:34.353
it will help your eyesight also.

01:03:34.553 --> 01:03:36.298
So keep your eyes completely closed.

01:03:36.498 --> 01:03:40.147
You don’t have to open till you are told to open your eyes.

01:03:40.347 --> 01:03:42.976
So you don’t have to worry at all.

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:46.973
If there is anything tight in your body, somewhere,

01:03:47.173 --> 01:03:49.941
just loosen it a little bit, – will be a good idea,

01:03:50.141 --> 01:03:52.771
so that you don’t feel uncomfortable.

01:03:53.978 --> 01:03:56.827
There’s nothing dangerous happens, never has happened.

01:03:57.272 --> 01:04:00.056
At the most you may feel little hot in the hand,

01:04:00.256 --> 01:04:02.461
at the most, doesn’t matter.

01:04:02.983 --> 01:04:06.068
So now, please close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

01:04:06.268 --> 01:04:08.980
Put your both the hands on your lap towards Me.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.310
Strain your fingers, stretching towards Me.

01:04:12.511 --> 01:04:16.099
Just put your hands on your lap stretching.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.409
Now put the right hand...

01:04:18.609 --> 01:04:21.449
Left hand has to be fixed as it is, all the time.

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:26.306
Now the left hand is to be stretched towards Me,

01:04:26.506 --> 01:04:28.830
stretched towards Me, not towards your own hands,

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.222
but towards Me, straight.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:37.705
Now, the right hand has to be lifted and put on your heart.

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:41.454
Just put it on the left side, on your heart.

01:04:43.692 --> 01:04:46.839
At this point, with all sincerity,

01:04:47.442 --> 01:04:52.374
you have to say or ask a question three times:

01:04:52.575 --> 01:04:56.337
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" - with full confidence.

01:04:56.539 --> 01:04:59.082
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

01:04:59.283 --> 01:05:01.988
Forget the past. Forget the past!

01:05:02.188 --> 01:05:03.607
Please, forget the past.

01:05:03.807 --> 01:05:06.147
Just now we are talking about the present.

01:05:06.347 --> 01:05:12.026
So just say: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:21.944
Three times.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.997
With full confidence, ask the question.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:42.723
Now, put this right hand on your stomach,

01:05:42.924 --> 01:05:44.852
on the left-hand side,

01:05:45.053 --> 01:05:49.104
the center of Swadishtana on the left-hand side.

01:05:51.355 --> 01:05:55.670
Nabhi Chakra, on the Nabhi chakra on the left-hand side.

01:05:58.185 --> 01:06:01.692
This is the center of the primordial master within you.

01:06:01.892 --> 01:06:06.504
And as you are the Spirit, you have to say with full confidence:

01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:11.220
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:06:11.442 --> 01:06:15.475
“I am my own guru” - you have to assert it.

01:06:16.684 --> 01:06:18.955
So that if you have been to wrong gurus,

01:06:19.156 --> 01:06:21.353
fake gurus, all kinds of cults,

01:06:21.553 --> 01:06:23.625
it will all disappear.

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:26.114
Please, say ten times:

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:30.956
"Mother, am I my own guide? Am I my own guru?"

01:06:31.157 --> 01:06:34.365
"Am I my own master?”

01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:46.782
Don’t feel guilty, please, don’t feel guilty.

01:06:46.982 --> 01:06:49.428
Don’t feel guilty.

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:55.430
Still you are feeling guilty - it’s very wrong.

01:07:01.459 --> 01:07:03.491
Candles.

01:07:05.575 --> 01:07:10.203
Now, put this right hand down below on the stomach.

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:14.946
Down below the stomach is the Swadishtana on the left-hand side.

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:21.716
At this point you have to say:

01:07:22.197 --> 01:07:25.988
“Mother, make me the master of the Divine art

01:07:26.189 --> 01:07:28.225
or Divine technique”.

01:07:28.427 --> 01:07:31.993
“Mother, I want to be the master of Divine technique”.

01:07:32.194 --> 01:07:36.919
This is the center of the mastery of Divine technique.

01:07:41.616 --> 01:07:44.087
Better.

01:08:03.857 --> 01:08:06.750
Please, say this six times.

01:08:11.457 --> 01:08:14.055
It's all right.

01:08:17.988 --> 01:08:22.999
Press this hand again onto the heart.

01:08:25.488 --> 01:08:27.312
Now assert here

01:08:27.514 --> 01:08:31.614
(unclear) you have to say it without feeling guilty.

01:08:32.014 --> 01:08:39.009
With full confidence you have to say: “Mother I am the Spirit”.

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:55.572
SY: Vishuddhi.

01:09:32.411 --> 01:09:35.868
SM: Still, the Hamsa is.

01:09:44.009 --> 01:09:48.654
Now, please put this right hand on the neck.

01:09:48.854 --> 01:09:53.488
Please, put your neck straight, don’t push it back too much.

01:09:53.886 --> 01:09:58.384
On the neck, on the left-hand side, near the shoulder,

01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:01.465
just put it there and..

01:10:02.838 --> 01:10:04.967
press it hard.

01:10:06.504 --> 01:10:09.122
At this point

01:10:09.323 --> 01:10:12.868
you have to say: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

01:10:14.133 --> 01:10:17.433
Please, say it: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

01:10:17.633 --> 01:10:22.853
Sixteen times you have to say: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:26.242
Heart.

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.369
It's better.

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:04.226
SY: Yes, it's good.

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:20.680
Now raise this hand higher onto your forehead across,

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.592
on your forehead across.

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:29.901
At this point you have to say: “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:11:31.761 --> 01:11:33.549
SM: Put the light there I think,

01:11:33.724 --> 01:11:37.537
because with this the right Vishuddhi is heated.

01:11:46.778 --> 01:11:49.107
Press it hard.

01:11:58.751 --> 01:12:00.324
Now without feeling guilty,

01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:03.268
put your right  hand to the back of your head,

01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:04.654
back of your head,

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:06.274
and try to press it hard,

01:12:06.474 --> 01:12:08.647
back of your head, just above, yes,

01:12:08.854 --> 01:12:11.658
back of your head. Now, try to pull it.

01:12:12.442 --> 01:12:14.587
Pull the head,

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:19.513
and push the head backwards and pull with your hand.

01:12:19.714 --> 01:12:24.814
At this point you have to say without feeling guilty -

01:12:25.014 --> 01:12:27.766
hundred times I say: without feeling guilty -

01:12:27.966 --> 01:12:30.489
you have to say:

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:37.139
"Oh Lord, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong".

01:12:38.974 --> 01:12:41.571
Again you feel guilty. Don’t feel guilty.

01:12:41.723 --> 01:12:44.901
Please, don’t feel guilty.

01:12:45.908 --> 01:12:48.108
SM: Better.
SY: Yes, it's passed.

01:12:48.309 --> 01:12:50.620
SM: It's the (unclear). Still there.

01:13:01.617 --> 01:13:05.163
Now, raise your hand on top of your head.

01:13:05.364 --> 01:13:10.022
SM: Just do that slowly. No, with the candle, means.

01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:13.809
Now, press it hard,

01:13:14.024 --> 01:13:16.420
in the center of it with your palm.
