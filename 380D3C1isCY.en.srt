1
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:36,860
So, this day is extremely important in a way
for Sahaja Yogis to observe and I'm happy

2
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:47,230
that I am here because it's very important
also for America. As I told you that, I have

3
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:58,890
already talked to you how the war between
Alexander and Poros was finished because of

4
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:08,240
a sister's intervention. And also how Shri
Krishna whose sister was Draupadi, Vishnumaya

5
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:21,350
was born as Draupadi and how He came to save
Her chastity by rushing all the way from Dwarika.

6
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:32,940
So, you can see that when we ascend in the
collective consciousness and we have collective

7
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:45,270
living, collective meeting at the Vishuddhi
Chakra, Shri Krishna establish this, or He

8
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:56,460
manifested this pure relationship of a sister.

9
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:07,150
In a collective life that we have, in the
Ashram where we live, where we move about

10
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:18,650
as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic
principle within us, there will be a chaos,

11
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:28,950
complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship
is established, that apart from my wife, all

12
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:54,090
the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot
be 
a proper society and the chaos of the social

13
00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:05,450
system of America is because they have no
sense of pure relationships.

14
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,950
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister.
And once you call somebody a brother, she's

15
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,860
(FYI -Mother does say She's - we double checked)
a brother. It's not only that you should be

16
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:25,400
born of the same parents, it's not necessary,
but this is a very important principle to

17
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:36,200
have a very pure society where everybody can
live peacefully. It's a common thing I have

18
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:45,990
seen in the West, that a lady comes as a friend
of the wife of the house. So, she's there

19
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:55,420
and she is a sister of the husband, has to
be. But on the contrary, next day you find

20
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:12,200
that this man starts having bad eyes towards
this lady, because, from very childhood, if

21
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,900
you have not fixed your attention on your
sister, with all that purity, you cannot have

22
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:29,620
that pure feelings for another woman.

23
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:38,920
The starting point is your own sister. The
son is born and then the daughter is born

24
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:46,370
or first the daughter is born and the son
is born. From that small age, when they are

25
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:55,950
innocent, this is a dimension of sisterly
pure relationship is developed, even when

26
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:04,230
the society is so corrupt and bad. But at
a very young age, say, at the age of eighteen

27
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:16,380
years, because of the social relations here
and the social ideas, the second part, which

28
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:26,260
is a brother's duty towards the sister, is
to respect the chastity of his sister and

29
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:42,830
to protect it, and also it is the sister's
duty to keep the brother moral, morally all

30
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,060
right.

31
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:52,420
So once it becomes freedom after the eighteen
years of time, eighteen years of age, then

32
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,760
the sister goes with any man, lives with any
man, the boy is not supposed to say anything,

33
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,800
or if the brother goes and stays with anyone,
the sister cannot say anything, she cannot

34
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:16,589
interfere. On the contrary, like India anywhere
or I was told also in China and Egypt, even

35
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:25,820
Islamic countries, if they find their sister
going with another man, they'll shoot that

36
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,720
man, in the Islamic countries. In India they
may not shoot, but they will see that the

37
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:42,690
sister is put right. Same with the brother,
in India I can say, in China also. If the

38
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:50,000
brother is immoral, he's going the wrong way,
then the sister tries her level best to bring

39
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,120
him back to normal morality.

40
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,620
It's very common that if a man is doing wrong,
then the wife goes to the sister and she's

41
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:13,050
very anxious, and she becomes very upset about
it. She goes all out to correct her brother.

42
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:25,330
And this innate understanding exists within
us. In every person, whether you are born

43
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:32,400
in America or anywhere, that if the brother
is doing the wrong thing, if he is smoking,

44
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,120
if he is doing wrong things, more than the
mother, the sister feels it, more than the

45
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:47,940
mother, the sister wants that it should be
corrected, and she goes all out, to fight

46
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:55,779
it out. Mother may start crying, weeping,
give up, but the sister will go on fighting

47
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:05,740
her brother. In her, all efforts, she will
see to it that the brother comes around. Also,

48
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:14,040
other things like, if the brother is doing
something illegal, something wrong, something

49
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,750
which is detrimental to the society, it is
the sister, who has a right, divine right,

50
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,190
to go and correct.

51
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:32,850
In a society, where this relationship is very
pure and where societies are quite settled

52
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,690
down, the question doesn't arise, mostly,
that the sisters do wrong. But supposing a

53
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:46,190
sister does something wrong, supposing a sister
goes out of the family, she tries to give

54
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:57,170
up her family for somebody else, or she tries
to dominate her husband or to do something

55
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:14,089
wrong in the family, then the brother will
go and tell her off, what he thinks of her,

56
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,750
and will try to correct her.

57
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:23,000
So this right to correct between brother and
sister does exist, not because it is some

58
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,830
sort of an outward thing but innately from
within ourselves. This is the Ganesha Principle

59
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:39,790
which acts, on Vishuddhi Chakra where, whatever
communications we have, we have a sister's

60
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:47,350
relationship and a mother's relationship.
Krishna also had a Foster Mother, as you know,

61
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:56,420
and the relationship with Him was exactly
like Her Own Son. So, if you call somebody

62
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:05,959
as a mother, it has to be absolutely pure
relationships. So there are three types of

63
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:13,830
relationships with a woman, is one, is that
of a mother, another of a sister or a daughter,

64
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,649
and another is of a wife.

65
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:25,800
Daughter cannot correct the father. Daughter
has no right to correct the father and she

66
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,620
will not correct the father. On the contrary,
even if he does wrong, she'll support him.

67
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,779
She'll stand by him. Always. She will even
go against the mother to support father. It's

68
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:45,680
nature. It's natural. But the son will correct
the father, if he is doing something against

69
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:53,709
the mother. It's a natural thing. It's a male
force supporting the female's force or the

70
00:16:53,709 --> 00:17:03,170
female force correcting the male force in
such a manner that the society is kept clean

71
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,470
and there is proper growth.

72
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:13,069
Only among barbaric people, according to Shastras,
only the Rakshas indulge into such impure

73
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:24,489
relationships all the time. Because there
is no purity in the society, it crawls up

74
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:35,330
into our mind and mentally we accept these
things as norms. Otherwise, there is no need

75
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:43,169
to look at every woman with lust and greed,
at every man with some lust. This abandonment

76
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:50,909
has basically started, when like Freud has
said it also, when the relationship with the

77
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:56,710
mother, relationship with the father, the
relationship with the brother and sisters

78
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:04,940
are basically spoiled in childhood, due to
the atmosphere, due to so many things, whatever

79
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:12,860
it is. And once it is ruined, this principle
of Ganesha is ruined on your Vishuddhi Chakra.

80
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:20,690
It' very, very difficult in Sahaja Yoga to
keep such people going on.

81
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:31,269
Now we have had problems in Ashrams of this
kind, which you know of, that they are living

82
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:40,200
in the Ashram and misbehaving. There are married
women also, we had experience of this, I mean

83
00:18:40,200 --> 00:19:05,590
it was such a horrifying thing, having 
relations in the most impure manner. Even
the unmarried, can do like this. I had a very

84
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:12,450
bad experience in Austria once, once here
also. It is such a horrible experience for

85
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:18,200
Me, I don't know what to do with them, because
I know they are Sahaja Yogis, they are seekers,

86
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,330
but this kind of weakness, we cannot have
in collectivity. It is like one really, a

87
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:35,299
bad apple, which will ruin all of them. So
even a one example like that cannot be tolerated,

88
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:41,619
not that, because it is so very venomnous,
(FYI _The correct word is Venomous but Mother

89
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:53,580
uses Venomnous) but because this kind of relationship
will ruin our collectivity.

90
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:03,200
In India we had a system called "Gotra", which
meant, that whatever university we studied,

91
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:11,200
is that your Gotra. For example, My forefathers',
forefathers', forefathers, all of them studied

92
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:22,340
in one university, which was started by Shandily
Muni. So they all went to his Ashram in different

93
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:32,330
places and did this, what you can say, a studies
and all those things together, but in one

94
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:41,340
Gotra, you cannot marry. Now so many years
have passed. Because we belong to Shandilya

95
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:52,999
Gotra, we cannot marry anyone in that Gotra.
So to that extent it is, and when to that

96
00:20:52,999 --> 00:21:03,200
extent it comes in our mind, we don't think
the other way round and doesn't come into

97
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,309
our minds like that.

98
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:12,340
Now we have societies like Islam, this Muslim
societies also. In the Muslim society because

99
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:21,539
of Pardha system, they are always suspicious
and they can never trust that a woman is having

100
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:28,059
a good relation with brothers or not, because
they have no Gotra system at all. They are

101
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:33,879
so suspicious, because there's no freedom
to talk and I have seen in India, where also

102
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:40,480
we can see that is quite a pure relationship
idea between the Muslims, but Muslims have

103
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,129
this problem. The women are suspicious, men
are suspicious, and everything is done secretly

104
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:49,320
and in a funny manner.

105
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,879
So another thing should be, that we should
be absolutely free in an Ashram. But there

106
00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:03,879
should not be a particular interest in one
person. If somebody gets a particular interest

107
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:11,389
in one person, then it is wrong. But in general,
we should be free as brothers and sisters.

108
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:18,049
I mean, we should be very free. The suspicion
should not come in, at that time. Suspicion

109
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:26,700
can only come in when one person is interested
only in one person and that is the time we

110
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,749
have to correct. Very important. Because,
it's all right, supposing somebody is a leader,

111
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:42,090
you are looking after the leader, is all right.
If somebody is your Rakhi Brother, is all

112
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,789
right, you are looking after Rakhi Brother.
But if you go beyond a certain limit, then

113
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:53,999
you better correct yourself, it's wrong. And
then if you really want to deceive yourself

114
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:58,299
and say, ' No, no, no, nothing's wrong,' then
know that this is not the way. You have come

115
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:03,919
to Sahaja Yoga, giving up all these nonsensical
things to ascend, and now this again crawling

116
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,210
upon you.

117
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,739
So the relationships should be of the same
type with everyone. Now what is the difference

118
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:16,759
in a society which is supposed to be elite,
where people flirt with each other. They'll

119
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,480
freely freely flirt, they flirt with this
person, that person that person that person,

120
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:31,739
like that. Not interested in anybody, this
thing. But, when they talk and when they have

121
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:40,980
any communication, what is behind this? Because
we have to search our own souls. We have to

122
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:49,210
find out ourselves. That's very important.
Soul-searching is important to see, why am

123
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:58,460
I so friendly with such and such person? If
you think that you are friendly with such

124
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,830
and such person for some other purpose, like
somebody might say that, ' Oh, I am all right,

125
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:11,019
because I am working with her,' or something
like that, but why interested?

126
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:17,220
Because soul-searching is very important in
these countries specially, because here there

127
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:26,549
is no norms about how you behave with other
women. So we have to be absolutely free as

128
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,549
I said with each other in the sense like that
brothers and sisters are. And whatever are

129
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:37,119
the limitations of a woman must be observed,
like you see, say, if My brother is sitting

130
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:46,369
with Me, I cannot watch a romantic picture.
Cannot. If My daughters are there, My husband

131
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:55,090
will not sit there to watch a romantic picture.
It's very subtle. With the brother you won't

132
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:01,979
discuss something, normally, say about sex
or about things like that, because it is such

133
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:09,559
a private thing that you can only have this
with your husband. So, if he is a brother

134
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:16,779
and you find him that he is trying to attract
the person in a way that you should not, then

135
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:23,659
you have to place yourself, against yourself,
and see for your sake, why you are doing it?

136
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:32,989
It's such a frivolous, nonsense thing, it's
a joyless pursuit! So why should I do it?

137
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:38,470
Once you understand the importance that Sahaja
Yoga, you can only achieve your ascent through

138
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:46,159
purity. There's no other way round. Anything
which is hanging on to you, will keep you

139
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:53,989
down. And whatever you go, start dropping
it out, whether it is ego, superego, anything.

140
00:25:53,989 --> 00:26:03,580
But the highest of all is the purity of your
mind as far as the sex is concerned. I will

141
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:15,200
give it the highest part. That's what we call
as innocence. That's the only thing that will

142
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:23,320
take you ahead. And so we all should try to
search our souls.

143
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,539
Now there are men and women who doubt each
other, all the time, and go on doubting each

144
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:37,330
other. But it is another joyless pursuit.
We have to watch ourselves and not others.

145
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:44,639
By doubting others we ruin our lives and the
lives of others. But, is the duty of the wife

146
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:53,499
and the husband to correct each other, if
they find anything wrong in that relationship.

147
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:59,830
Now this discrimination has to be there. Mostly
I have seen that if they are crazy people,

148
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:11,259
they'll go on doubting everyone. It's a kind
of a possession. If they are doubting their

149
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:17,820
wife they'll go on after her life. If they
are doubting about the husband, they'll go

150
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:27,429
on after. This again spoils your collectivity.
Such people cannot be collective and cannot

151
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:35,009
be Sahaj. And I would say such people should
be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. Or else they

152
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:44,499
should be separated. Because, this is a very
subtle type of an aggression can take place

153
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:54,220
or a subtle type of a torture can take place
and a very bad type of relationships can develop,

154
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,519
between the Sahaja Yogis.

155
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:05,359
I have seen one case in Australia, which was
very, very serious for Me. There was an Indian

156
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:13,369
girl and she got after her husband about these
things and so many people she hurt and so

157
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:19,559
many people left Sahaja Yoga and nobody could
discover why they are leaving. Because, she

158
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:29,840
used to do, very subtly. And it came out of
her inferiority complex, or whatever it is

159
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,989
and when she came to India, her husband left
her and when I talked to her, the person whom

160
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:44,779
she was suspecting is one of the gem of a
persons I know. I was shocked, how she could

161
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:50,489
think like that. Now I discovered that her
mother was like that also.

162
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:59,470
So one has to know that the purity of mind
has to be there, has to be very clean and

163
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:12,590
open. But in that openness, you should see
the freshness of mind. If you are not fresh,

164
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,349
in your mind, and you do then think, then
know, that is not correct. Today I am touching

165
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:23,509
these subjects because we have had problems
like this in America. And also America is

166
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:27,609
a place which is seething with this nonsense.
And I don't know when are they going to stop

167
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:36,379
it. There is no end to it. But for you people
to establish proper, proper collectivity,

168
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:44,879
it is extremely important to understand, that
you should do soul- searching about it. You

169
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:53,099
have to understand through your vibrations,
through your own understanding. Because I

170
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,539
cannot say, "You are wrong, you are wrong."
You have to find out, if there is something

171
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:06,320
wrong within you to establish this pure relationship.
If you people really strive to do that, and

172
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:16,859
really pray, I tell you half of the problems
of this country will be solved. Solved forever.

173
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:23,029
You see, people are suffering from this disease,
that disease. I mean, I ask them, " Why do

174
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:28,399
you do that?" He said, 'Because women are
not dependable; You go home, there is a play

175
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,989
with another man. It's better to stay with
a man than to stay with a woman.' I mean,

176
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:40,330
absurd, unnatural, nonsensical thing they
do. Same with the women.

177
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:51,679
Now if fidelity is between husband and wife
in the real sense of the word, again we come

178
00:30:51,679 --> 00:31:01,389
to reality, real sense of the word, then the
man and women should become free like birds.

179
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:15,899
They know. So, it is the childhood relationship
between brother and a sister. I would say,

180
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:20,159
with everybody else in the childhood whatever
relations you have. You see the child goes

181
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,469
to an uncle, to another uncle, to her, everybody
is an uncle, to another aunt, it is that.

182
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:33,840
So he develops all his dimensions of purity,
in childhood. But if you keep the child all

183
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,379
the time, ' No, no, this is my child, can't
go to this person, can't go to that person,'

184
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:47,159
then the child develops those corners. Then,
when the child is exposed, later on, gradually,

185
00:31:47,159 --> 00:32:00,229
you don't have to give any ideas; he would
not do immoral things automatically. You don't

186
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:05,729
have to teach them about sex, you don't have
to do anything. Because, after all in India,

187
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:09,399
we don't tell children anything. We never
talk to them about anything. Just grow. I

188
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:16,309
mean, you leave them alone anywhere, no question.
I mean, I know, now say I have My two daughters,

189
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:21,979
now they have their husbands, they might fight
with each other sometimes, whatever it is.

190
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:28,599
But left to themselves, I cannot think it
is possible that any other man can attract

191
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:35,950
their attention, on a wrong way. They'll be
free with anyone, talk to everyone, they cannot!

192
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:42,019
But I have never told a word about sex or
anything. I mean I feel shy even to say this

193
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:49,109
word to them. How is it they have got this
innately built in within themselves, because

194
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:57,409
the society, the Indian society is such that
brothers', sisters' relations are beautiful.

195
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:05,039
In Greece, which is a very ancient country
also, but now they are becoming modernized.

196
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,899
So we have, our Stamatis is there, is an interesting
person, as you know, Stamatis is very interesting

197
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:17,309
person, he's a lawyer and he is in Athens.
So he told Me a joke. He said, 'Mother, when

198
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:22,729
we became young,' I mean he is already young,
but according to Me, he became young much

199
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:28,509
earlier, ' so when we became young, we all
boys decided, let's have some good time with

200
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:33,749
the girls to be modern. But immediately they
all started, 'But not my sister, ah, spare

201
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:39,389
my sister, spare my sister. Don't touch my
sister.' So I said, " Which, which is the

202
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:45,679
girl who has no brother? All girls have brother."
I said, "No, you see, this won't work out.

203
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,729
In Greece it won't work out. I told her."
You see exactly, see, they are suggested that

204
00:33:52,729 --> 00:34:00,359
no brother likes his sister to be exploited
by any man.

205
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,889
And this is the principle. How you please
your brother by remaining chaste and how you

206
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:11,950
please your sister by remaining chaste. So
there's a mutual controlling power, which

207
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:17,059
is innate, again I'll say: "It is innate,
it is not forced by society, innate." But

208
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:22,889
in a society, which is so artificial, where
all the time the ideas are put into your heads,

209
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,619
there's brainwashing going on. You just start
thinking there is something wrong, this is

210
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:36,779
not proper, this is being something absurd.
But even among animals I have seen, this works

211
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:52,690
for quite sometime. So what about human beings?
So all these qualities, that we have within

212
00:34:52,690 --> 00:35:10,119
us, which are innate, are beautiful. The societies
which are spoiled, ruined, or we see these

213
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:21,099
decadent societies, that's what you can call
them, are the societies which have got a very

214
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,910
good system built in, of brainwashing.

215
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:33,089
Even about say one hundred years back in this
country, the society was not like this. Even

216
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:38,420
fifty years back it was not like this. If
you see the films and things you will know,

217
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,740
that the innate value system was the same,
but now people are so much brainwashed, that

218
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:50,490
all their innate qualities have been destroyed,
and there are all artificial qualities are

219
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:57,520
there. Now Sahaja Yoga is the innate religion
within us, and one of the innate religion,

220
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:14,430
or we can say one of the innate religious
quality, is that we understand the purity

221
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,809
and the beauty of brothers' and sisters' relations.

222
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:32,339
Like, say for example, A is a sister of B.
Now, B has a friend. Now, this friend comes

223
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:39,740
to the house and A starts getting friendly
with B, take it like that. In American way,

224
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,589
I don't know how far they go or whatever way.
That troubles the brother. He doesn't like

225
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:52,650
it. That troubles the sister also, because
she, she doesn't know how she stands, she

226
00:36:52,650 --> 00:37:02,950
becomes nervous. She's not sure as to how
to go far with it. So the all the relations

227
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:12,589
become confused and they don't know how to
how to deal with each other, how to express

228
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:27,279
themselves, how to behave in a manner, that
the relationship between these three is again

229
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:40,460
normal. And most of the society, societies,
which are so abandon, if you go and really

230
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:47,670
examine these people you'll be surprised that
they're extremely nervous people. They say

231
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:53,529
that if you have to make out an American among
thousands, is very easy. His nose will be

232
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:59,150
twitching, his eyes will be going like this,
his hands will be going like that, of course

233
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:06,049
not Sahaja Yogis, and it's very easy to make
it out. The reason is: he's all the time on

234
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:13,260
tentacles. He doesn't know what his sister
is doing, what his mother is doing, what his

235
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,980
wife is doing or the other way round also
for a woman. That's why the maximum number

236
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:26,109
of breast cancers are in America. With all
this advancement, if you see the statistics,

237
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:31,640
the maximum number of patients are here.

238
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:38,599
So apart from ego and superego, the worst
thing that has happened to these modern societies

239
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:47,910
is that, that they have lost their innate
understanding of purity. That innate understanding

240
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:57,039
in Sahaja Yoga now you have got it. So try
to develop it and flower it, so the fragrance

241
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:08,279
of that innocence will make each other very
happy and such a kind of a security. One feels

242
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:16,220
so secure. And that's why it is a Raksha Bandhan,
that the protection of a brother and a protection

243
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:22,770
of a sister. All the time you know, my brother
is there, after all, my sister is there. A

244
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:34,829
kind of a very pure, beautiful feeling, that
I have somebody to protect me. And this beautiful

245
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:43,990
feeling, if it's nurtured, looked after, in
a wider way in Sahaja Yoga, then you feel

246
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,170
absolutely, absolutely secure.

247
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:57,440
Like one lady went to Sicily, she is a Sahaja
Yogini and there's another one from another

248
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:07,480
corner went down to Sicily. They were sitting
apart from each other in a restaurant. And

249
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,720
she just looked at her and she looked at her
and they just felt they were both Realized

250
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,640
Souls. So she just came on by, she said, ' By
the way, have you heard about Shri Mataji

251
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,589
Nirmala Devi?' She said, 'Are you a Sahaja
Yogini?" She said, ' I am.'

252
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,910
'I'm also Sahaja Yogini.'
They hugged each other, kissed each other.

253
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:34,119
See normally, if it is done with a woman,
here they will call her something else. But,

254
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:44,400
they described, 'Mother, we started crying.
We both we are feeling lonely there, and we

255
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:52,349
started crying.' Such beautiful relation.
But if any such I mean I was surprised that

256
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,750
ah.. maybe some people came to India and said,
' Oh my God, here all the girls are holding

257
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,970
each other's hands!' I said, " Why? What,
whose hands they should hold then?" First

258
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:08,460
I couldn't understand and they were surprised.
How are they holding each other's hand? So,

259
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:15,920
I mean, at everybody is a target. Everybody
is looked into as if he is a dirty fellow.

260
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,400
Whether it's a man or a woman, whether it
is a relationship between man and man or woman

261
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:31,279
and woman. I mean it's filth. It's dirt. So
we have to get out of it. And to get out of

262
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:43,650
it we must understand that, relationship are
only enjoyed if they are pure.

263
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:51,369
And also, say in a sap of the tree is rising.
Now the sap has to give something to the leaves.

264
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:59,880
Instead of giving that to the leaves, it starts
giving that green chlorophyll, say to the

265
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:08,490
flower. The flower will become green and the,
I don't know if the leaves will also survive

266
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:21,880
this kind of misplacements. So, whatever relationship
you have to give to anyone, has to be pure

267
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,789
and meticulous about it, that what relationship
you have to give.

268
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:34,069
For example, I am your Guru. So, the relationship
between you and Me is precise. So, supposing

269
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:45,289
you say, ' What does it matter, I can go and
sit in Mother's lap?' You cannot. You cannot

270
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:51,430
do it. Though I mean, it's a pure relationship,
still you cannot, or, ' I might put my feet

271
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:57,779
towards my Mother.' I cannot, because these
all relations must be understood in its pure

272
00:42:57,779 --> 00:43:04,500
forms. Even in electricity you see now, supposing
this is a fan running here, and you got a

273
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:14,700
plug, now supposing you put that plug in your
nose, will it run? It looks absurd, but that

274
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:20,640
is what it is. All these modern ideas are
like this, that you are putting the plug into

275
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:31,950
the nose. And the handkerchief, instead of
the nose, it goes into that plug. It is so

276
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:40,599
absurd and it is so useless. And it shows
how idiotic people have become.

277
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:48,549
So, we should know what is the relationship
we have with this, with each other, what is

278
00:43:48,549 --> 00:44:04,410
the relationship we have in the collective,
how do we behave. Of course, in the collective

279
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:08,829
way, always, the girls will pull the legs
of boys and boys will pull the legs of the

280
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:14,380
girls, is all right, and can go on among themselves
also, is all right. But as long as there is

281
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:21,260
purity, nobody will mind. They' ll all enjoy.
But as soon as it becomes perverted, then

282
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:27,970
the problems start and, in Sahaja Yoga, these
useless problems has taken away so much of

283
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:34,430
My energy that I am now fed up with it. Really
fed up!

284
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:39,319
Somebody writes to Me from there, ' Mother,
I have suddenly fallen in love with somebody.'

285
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:52,329
Now recently, there was a boy, he was married,
from England, married to a girl, a girl from

286
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:57,890
India. And there was a lady, who was married,
maybe I don't know quite what should I call

287
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:03,250
her, she's not a lady anymore, married to
French man. She went to France, lived with

288
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:12,539
him and came back. Now, he's an English boy.
They, before marriage, they were just friends

289
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:19,260
and all right, and after they got married,
both of them started living together. And

290
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:27,869
I can't understand. Before marriage, it never
entered into their head. After marriage, why

291
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:29,859
this has entered into their head?

292
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:35,700
'Mother, we don't know what to do now.' You
see, that, that French boy is fed up, he said,

293
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,390
' I have nothing to do with this but for this
Indian girl, what to do, what am I to tell

294
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:44,690
her?' Because for her, he's her husband. Because
Indians are not like this, to put the plug-

295
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:51,950
in- the- nose- type, you see. So she cannot
understand. And, she does not know what to

296
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:57,460
say and I don't know what to tell her. How
to solve his problem? It is such a funny problem

297
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:07,099
now. This French boy found her out in no time,
is just given up. But now, such a headache,

298
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:15,720
such a ...This boy came to see Me, this English
boy, discussing with Me till 2:30 in the night

299
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,599
and then directly I said, " Now if you don't
get away now, I'll beat you," so he ran away.

300
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,000
He came inside, directly inside. " Now, it's
2:30, will you please get out from there?"

301
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,339
And what he was telling Me, ' I know, I know.
This is wrong. I know this is wrong. I know

302
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:39,299
I am putting the plug into my nose. '
"All right then?"

303
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:44,029
'But, I have been struggling with myself for
six months. I don't know what to do with myself.'

304
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:52,920
I said, "But are you possessed?"
He said, ' No, but I know.'

305
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,619
They think, in these Western societies, that
once they say, ' I know, I am doing wrong,

306
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:03,420
I know, I am doing,' then finished! You have
confessed to God, you have confessed to everyone.

307
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:13,910
'I know this is wrong, but I am doing it.'
But till 2:30 was just saying this to Me.

308
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,410
I said, " But what is the solution?"
'I know there is no solution, I know, and

309
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:25,509
whatever I did, I understand, I know.'
"What do you understand? Now, give Me the

310
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,309
solution."
'I don't know.'

311
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:41,569
So I told him that, "Really I am so fed up
with you that I have decided I'll have no

312
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:47,049
more marriages, because you have no sense
of marriage. Till you got married, you were

313
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:51,710
all right. You were nice to her. You wrote
one letter to her and suddenly now, how have

314
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:55,980
you fallen together?"
He said, ' It was spontaneous, got spontaneous.

315
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:07,769
This girl came to place where I was working
for something and I met her. Finished. That's

316
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:14,029
all.' He knew this girl before, they were
together, everything was there, nothing happened.

317
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:17,039
Suddenly, what has happened?

318
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:29,059
Now, what I gather that Western society is
built up against marriages, against families.

319
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:38,859
To be married, according to them, is a sin.
And once you are married, to get out of the

320
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:45,650
sin you must do something like that. Because
they live together, for days together, and

321
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:53,670
once they marry, immediately they think of
divorce. Because marriage is now so much connected

322
00:48:53,670 --> 00:49:00,380
with property, money, this, that, nonsense.
That the whole thing has become so gross,

323
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:05,750
and after marriage, there's no question of
love, because how much money goes, how much

324
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,190
part of the house goes, how many things are
mine, how many? The whole thing has become

325
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:20,410
so materialistic, such marriages can never
be successful.

326
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:26,500
But in Sahaja Yoga we marry for our ascent.
And we have to respect our marriages and to

327
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:35,150
respect our chastities with our brothers and
sisters. Those people who try, to somehow

328
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:47,190
or other ruin the purity of collectivity,
I assure you, will be in very great trouble,

329
00:49:47,190 --> 00:50:00,190
henceforth. I think every sort of divine punishment
comes after every period. And now, I've started

330
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:16,630
feeling with My experience that any such absurd
manifestation of impurity, I need not say

331
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:24,470
anything about it. There is a divine punishment
and of a very horrible nature. Now I've got

332
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:29,980
three to four] experiences and I think it
has already started. It's nice, there is today

333
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:37,220
is a day when I can talk to you about it.
I can't help it. I think periodically some

334
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:43,750
new ideas of punishments have been started
by this divine power. And for people who behave

335
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:53,079
like this, I have seen there are terrible
things. So, please do your soul- searching.

336
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:59,680
Find out if there are any impure feelings,
try to throw them away. And know that you

337
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,119
are not possessed by such funny ideas.

338
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:15,769
If you start developing a deeper understanding,
then you will not be attracted by superficial

339
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:32,829
things. And you won't be distracted from your
path. There was one girl in India, was very

340
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:43,299
dark, say, I couldn't call her in anyway beautiful.
She's tall but she's very, very dark. There's

341
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:51,990
somebody who was all right for her age, so,
I asked him, I said, "She's not suitable for

342
00:51:51,990 --> 00:52:00,450
you. But, you can have a look at her." He
saw her and he said, 'Mother, I want to marry

343
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:05,279
her. I feel so tranquil in her company. Such
beautiful vibrations!'

344
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:09,759
So once you develop your deeper side, then
you do not see all the superficial thing,

345
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:16,660
but you see the vibrations of the person and
once you start seeing the vibrations, you'll

346
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:28,950
be surprised that if these relationships are
not all right, your vibrations will stop.

347
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:37,660
You won't feel the vibrations. You must know,
that Chaitanya is a living energy which thinks,

348
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,750
which knows, which understands, everything!

349
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:48,579
So if you are getting wrong ideas about somebody
and if you try to see vibrations, you'll get

350
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:55,269
heat, automatically. It's a computer which
thinks, the information that is filled into

351
00:52:55,269 --> 00:53:07,710
this computer, it refills itself. Such a computer.
As soon as you start feeling the vibrations

352
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:16,799
of such a person, immediately you feel that
there are no vibrations or there's heat. But

353
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:25,480
supposing you are unnecessarily suspicious
and unnecessarily you are trying to trouble

354
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,180
yourself, then also, same thing will happen.

355
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:38,970
You have got, of course Realization, you have
got great qualities. You are not even aware

356
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:44,339
as to what you've got so easily. You've got
the knowledge also so easily and didn't have

357
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:52,980
to go to college or anything and you are capable
of so many things, but remember, that the

358
00:53:52,980 --> 00:54:02,000
power that is within you is cleverer than
you and anything you try to do, which is not

359
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:11,960
correct, which is not righteous, which is
not holy, it will try to correct you. So,

360
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:29,180
try to be a deeper person. Try to understand
what is behind this person, what is the spiritual

361
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:45,660
quality of this person and then only you will
know that pure relationships are so fragrant

362
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:45,680
and so beautiful.

363
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:52,069
I really enjoy you people because you have
such pure relationships among yourselves and

364
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:52,119
such understanding.

365
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:52,230
May God bless you.

366
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:52,690
Today, so much Puja has been done, but for
this thing there is never a Puja as such.

367
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,200
Today we'll do the Puja, so what we have to
do is just a Ganesha Puja on My feet. That's

368
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:53,390
the only thing we can do because it's the
quality of Ganesha. The quality of Ganesha,

369
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:53,769
Puja, it's sufficient because He stands for
purity. I wish I could show you a photograph

370
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:53,970
that I have of Shri Ganesha Himself.

371
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,390
Actually He's behind Me, actually He's there
as He is, because you see it was a, it was

372
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:54,799
a Shiv Puja, Shivratri and they had done all
kinds of Himalayas and all that behind Me

373
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:55,170
and this is the only photograph, He really
appeared, so sweetly. See His eyes, when they

374
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:55,579
said Niranjan. He is just so innocent and
He has pulled out His trunk also little bit,

375
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:55,980
so that I should not be in anyway hurt by
any possibility. [Unclear word] I didn't see

376
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,309
Him. But it's on (Mother corrects Herself)
only in this photograph He is there.
