00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:05,341
Hello Anne, how are you?

2
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:12,416
Seminar in Mill Farm – Sherborne, Dorset (UK), 2 August 1981.

3
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,162
What a beautiful place we are all in.

4
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:26,858
It’s a real blessing of Sahaja Yoga for all of you to relax,

5
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:34,629
relax well. Because in relaxation only you realize that,

6
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,112
we are now realized souls.

7
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:44,641
That we have entered into the kingdom of heaven.

8
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:49,753
That we can see the beauty what God has created around us.

9
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:52,558
That we have become sensitive to His grace

10
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:56,891
and to His kindness and to His love.

11
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:09,680
It’s a seminar that you have arranged and I’m very happy.

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,063
I always wanted you to arrange seminars

13
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:16,212
and that you all should meet together and live together,

14
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:20,249
and understand each other.

15
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:24,398
The seminars on the gross level

16
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:28,919
they work out many things no doubt.

17
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,740
But on subtler levels, seminars of the Sahaja yogis,

18
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,345
means a lot.

19
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:45,438
It means that a strong nucleus is being consolidated

20
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,254
in various places in a country.

21
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:53,316
And these strongholds

22
00:01:53,516 --> 00:02:00,500
or we can say the strong nucleus which is created like this,

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,338
can form a mechanism by which

24
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:13,111
beams of strong vibrations could flow

25
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,065
or could be thrown all over the places.

26
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:25,227
It’s a very great task to build up these mechanisms,

27
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:34,204
these divine mechanisms in different parts of your country.

28
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,237
Please, take her out for a while.

29
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:49,349
For example, Mother Earth has done Her job.

30
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,779
Wherever it was possible for Her, She has created

31
00:02:54,979 --> 00:03:01,389
living deities

32
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:05,643
to show that God exists.

33
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:09,455
That you can now test their vibrations and see for yourself

34
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,769
how She has worked very hard.

35
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:18,566
She has created all this beautiful universe.

36
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:23,155
She has created you also.

37
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:28,214
She has created the kundalini within you.

38
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:34,222
She represents the beautiful nature we can say.

39
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:41,247
In Her company, in Her bounties when you are drenched

40
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:45,603
and you all meet each other,

41
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:47,761
you see for yourself

42
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,414
that how She blesses all of you just the same.

43
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:57,266
There is no difference

44
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:00,362
between you and any other person for Her.

45
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,721
But those who are sensitive, are subtler people,

46
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:09,117
enjoy Her much more than you people do.

47
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:15,283
Now the problem that exists in every country

48
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:18,471
has its own style I have seen.

49
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:23,862
And as in this country also we have a style of problems

50
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:27,914
which comes. Gradually it’s changing its form.

51
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:32,899
In the beginning I found that people were overaggressive,

52
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:40,322
sceptical and also could be rude also sometimes.

53
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:43,720
It’s all right. Makes no difference to Me.

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,433
Now gradually they started changing over.

55
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:55,090
Now they are becoming aware of what they have got,

56
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,052
what role they are playing, how important it is to be an Englishman.

57
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,019
And when I say English I mean all the English people,

58
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:07,006
not Wales or anything different,

59
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:13,375
and how they have to become

60
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:17,061
part and parcel of the heart of the universe.

61
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,344
I wondered how many of you really realize

62
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:23,473
how important it is to be an Englishman.

63
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:29,110
That everything that happens in this country circulates.

64
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,807
For example if this royal wedding had taken place

65
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:37,269
in any other royal family it would not have circulated so much.

66
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,353
Everything circulates from this country.

67
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,889
Maybe you may not think much of yourself.

68
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:44,701
You may think that what is so great

69
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:48,168
after all this England is like any other country.

70
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:53,913
But you see why people accept so many things from you?

71
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:56,133
Like even a monarchy,

72
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:01,016
I mean most of the countries have thrown away their monarchies.

73
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:06,612
And in this country it exists and it has a respectable position.

74
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:11,368
And the symbol of a monarchy

75
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:16,880
is still lingering here in a very proud way.

76
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,752
Then the marriage itself,

77
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:22,022
the marriages of royal families are always detested

78
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:26,073
and protested and nobody is interested.

79
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:29,479
And such a auspicious thing should take place here

80
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:33,284
and that everybody should see it.

81
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:37,135
So many countries should watch it and appreciate it

82
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:40,667
and enjoy it of all the things.

83
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,492
It’s something surprising.

84
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,026
It transcends all rationality,

85
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:53,465
all understanding of even logic

86
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,511
we can say that what is the logic behind it?

87
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,530
But if you are enjoying it you just enjoy.

88
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,574
You don’t want to think about it why you are enjoying.

89
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,870
So, one has to understand that you are part and parcel

90
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,180
of the heart of the universe.

91
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,390
One thing is essential

92
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,743
that you have to be very flexible people.

93
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,871
You have to have

94
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:33,033
the flexibility of the heart cells we can say.

95
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:40,440
Now heart has to pump.

96
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,265
It has to be strong.

97
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:50,488
And surprisingly lion is your emblem.

98
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:54,441
So you have to have a lion’s heart.

99
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,743
And lion’s heart means he is not afraid.

100
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:01,662
He is the king. He knows he’s the king and he lives like a king.

101
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:08,876
Like a lion and Leo as in astrology

102
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:14,392
or if you say is a man who is extremely generous,

103
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,807
lion hearted, not afraid of anyone.

104
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:21,187
There should be no fear.

105
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,082
But English language if you read anyone

106
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:27,144
or if you listen to anyone,

107
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:30,169
every third sentence he’ll come with the word,

108
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,802
“I’m afraid.

109
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:36,177
I’m afraid to say, I’m afraid this is so”…

110
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:40,911
This word must be dropped out from the vocabulary of Sahaja yogis.

111
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:44,798
What is there to be afraid of?

112
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,512
Some people say that this is said because we do not want

113
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:51,071
to hurt other people. There are so many other ways

114
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:53,332
of saying things without hurting others.

115
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,894
But what is there to be afraid of?

116
00:08:57,094 --> 00:09:01,183
A man who is weak cannot love.

117
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:05,832
Only a strong person can love.

118
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,043
If you talk of love first of all see

119
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:11,045
whether you are strong enough to love or not.

120
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,115
Loving is not a easy thing, even carnal love,

121
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:17,635
even loving your beloved of in the ordinary sense.

122
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,252
It’s not a easy thing.

123
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:25,299
You have to have a very strong moral concept,

124
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:30,604
otherwise every third minute people start changing their loves.

125
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:33,353
That kind of a love has no meaning.

126
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:42,483
You have to have a very firm ideas.

127
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:47,183
Not only ideas in your brain but built within you.

128
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:54,045
Very few people can really have a love as Romeo had,

129
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,232
I can tell you this.

130
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:59,643
It’s easy to think that you are a Romeo, it’s different.

131
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:02,854
You can think you are you are the King of England,

132
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:06,651
it’s all right. But you don’t become that way.

133
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:10,690
So to be Romeo itself

134
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,026
you have to have a tremendous character.

135
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:22,048
A tremendous sense of sacrifice and love

136
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:26,634
and understanding of what you want.

137
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:33,343
You want to love, that’s all nothing beyond or before.

138
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:37,869
I mean a man when he falls in love

139
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,326
he falls in love forever and ever and ever.

140
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:45,736
If he falls in love many a times it cannot be love.

141
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,009
So that experience also

142
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:54,732
is sort of is a forbidden fruit for most of them.

143
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:07,686
So to love God is even more difficult,

144
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:11,415
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

145
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:16,118
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

146
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:20,143
It is very difficult.

147
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:24,820
But today that is not the case.

148
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:32,983
But still you have to have

149
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:37,092
no fear in your mind, trust,

150
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,947
you trust yourself and trust others.

151
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:45,358
First of all try to trust yourself.

152
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,754
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

153
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:53,339
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right so what?”

154
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,698
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

155
00:11:56,898 --> 00:12:01,406
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

156
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:05,203
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

157
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:10,762
I can improve. I can do better.”

158
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:17,340
Some people think that if you trust yourself

159
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,504
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

160
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:24,842
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

161
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:32,046
This is a wrong idea. You have to trust yourself by saying that,

162
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:36,564
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

163
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,736
I have been faltering but I can correct.

164
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,759
I have that strength within me.

165
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,728
I can rise above all these things.

166
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:51,477
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

167
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:59,514
Trust yourself. Trust that you are realized souls.

168
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,714
Trust that God loves you.

169
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:06,759
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

170
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,709
Love yourself.

171
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:16,125
You are unique no doubt.

172
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:20,719
As it is human beings, every individual is an unique person.

173
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,010
But after realization

174
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,468
you are definitely unique person.

175
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:37,380
It never means ego trip. One has to use

176
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,255
discretion about understanding. It never means ego trip.

177
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:47,931
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

178
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:56,683
Yes you are not perfect.

179
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:03,168
You are unique but you are not perfect. You have to perfect yourself.

180
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:08,517
These words can be very confusing. When I say you are unique

181
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,428
immediately, you think you are perfect.

182
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:14,784
These are two words, unique and perfect.

183
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,931
Somebody can be unique

184
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,042
but he can have imperfections.

185
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:23,901
So you have to perfect yourself.

186
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,878
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

187
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,648
through your kundalini awakening, clearing your charkas.

188
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:36,028
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

189
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:43,009
You have to perfect. I have so many ways I tell you;

190
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,468
directly, sometimes indirectly, through friends,

191
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:52,972
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

192
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:57,258
You should think that I am within you.

193
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:02,290
I am that part within you which is discretion.

194
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,219
When you do not understand your own discretion,

195
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:12,339
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

196
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:17,549
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

197
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,971
or, some of them accept it.

198
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:24,105
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

199
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,824
you are definitely unique,

200
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:31,026
one specially blessed.

201
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:33,567
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

202
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,181
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

203
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:46,207
So you have to discriminate between ego

204
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:51,264
or ego trips as they call it

205
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:55,230
and ascent.

206
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:02,981
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

207
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,679
It would be something like throwing you in the air

208
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,938
and again you come back with a bump and break

209
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:13,219
one of your necks or something like that.

210
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,042
That’s what ego trip is.

211
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:20,384
But ascent is where you really rise above.

212
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:23,306
Not only that you rise

213
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:27,137
but with you,

214
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,379
you make others rise.

215
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:35,704
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

216
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,558
The higher you ascend the better it is.

217
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:42,795
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

218
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:46,629
never so.

219
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:54,286
There’s a story of a teacher and a student.

220
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,028
The teacher was very kind to the student

221
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,701
and he would come and show him his creations.

222
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,424
He was very kind to him.

223
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,391
And every time he would say that,

224
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,352
“I have done this good

225
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:15,015
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

226
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:18,550
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

227
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,502
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

228
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:25,709
you better correct this part, then do this.”

229
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:32,790
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

230
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,205
He said, “You are no more student now.”

231
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:45,546
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

232
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:52,814
There was another

233
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:58,669
student who was coming every day and correcting himself.

234
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,295
And he told to his teacher that,

235
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:08,487
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

236
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,585
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

237
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:19,084
The third one was a student who came

238
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:25,572
and he was always trying to see what was the mistake

239
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,822
and how he has to correct and how he worked very hard,

240
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:32,991
very assiduous, very hard working.

241
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:42,379
And he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

242
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,184
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

243
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:49,860
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

244
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:59,401
That is what one has to understand.

245
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,956
You ascend.

246
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:04,526
You will become humbler.

247
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,721
It is just the other way around people understand.

248
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:10,605
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved some special powers.

249
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:14,714
I don’t know. Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

250
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:17,151
I am very good in spirituality.

251
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:20,822
I am very high up and all that, this self-certificate starts.

252
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:24,856
And then it can reach such a point

253
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:29,923
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

254
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:35,342
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

255
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,875
Actually the people who ascend

256
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:43,856
there are certain qualities that show on them.

257
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:48,296
The first thing is your collectivity.

258
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:52,418
How collective you are.

259
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,908
With how many people you can carry on.

260
00:19:56,108 --> 00:20:00,006
At how many things you can laugh.

261
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:05,187
That is one of the biggest qualities.

262
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,066
The second quality is that

263
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:12,537
how much you accept another’s domination

264
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:16,450
who, cuts down your collectivity.

265
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:20,382
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

266
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:26,274
If you allow others to cut your personality,

267
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:31,689
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

268
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:34,382
you are the employee.

269
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:38,469
And the boss is not realized soul and you are an realized soul.

270
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,403
Or maybe both are realized souls. Take it like that.

271
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:50,229
And one of them is ascending.

272
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,018
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

273
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:58,015
there are congenial relationship, but to a point.

274
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:00,931
He will never compromise with his boss

275
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:03,790
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

276
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,609
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

277
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:16,518
On that point he’ll never have any domination because

278
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:19,908
how much you feel responsible about yourself

279
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:24,642
is the second point.

280
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:29,167
How much you are responsible to be there,

281
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,817
to be a cell in the heart.

282
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:36,713
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

283
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,371
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

284
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:53,826
and extremely obedient to the Self, to the Spirit.

285
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,845
It has to activate, work harder when there is need,

286
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:03,744
there emergency.

287
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:08,803
That it enjoys the most.

288
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:18,603
And no impurity should be allowed, the third point now.

289
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:26,688
As I told you first is collectivity, secondly your responsibility

290
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,393
and third point is purity.

291
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:33,833
Purity of your own heart first of all,

292
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:39,857
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

293
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:45,285
As I am saying this you will be realizing that all Englishmen

294
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:50,754
believe in the contrary,

295
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:55,872
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

296
00:22:56,072 --> 00:23:00,590
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

297
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,403
Trust others.

298
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:08,840
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

299
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,321
Trust others.

300
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:16,623
Why do you doubt? If you do not doubt yourself,

301
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:19,586
you’ll not doubt others.

302
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:22,101
What are they going to take away from you?

303
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,621
What have you got?

304
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:29,118
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

305
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:35,410
It’s all quite intact. It’s all nicely glued down.

306
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,098
So nothing is going to disappear.

307
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:49,519
What are they going to hurt to a person who is a realized soul?

308
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,774
If your heart is clean,

309
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,780
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

310
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,875
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

311
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:04,190
such a powerful thing that even a glance

312
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,608
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

313
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,229
Purity of heart, actually when the heart becomes impure

314
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,856
the impurity flows down to other places.

315
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,392
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

316
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:29,869
Many people believe that it’s the body

317
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,995
that becomes impure. I think it is the heart,

318
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,441
which becomes really impure,

319
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,683
and then it starts trickling down to the body

320
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:42,571
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

321
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:52,011
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart. Open heart.

322
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:57,279
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

323
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:01,386
What is there not to trust anyone?

324
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,300
What is there to be angry with anyone?

325
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:13,022
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

326
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:17,480
be nice to everyone. On the way you find somebody’s difficulty,

327
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,849
give him a hand. If somebody cannot sit properly e.

328
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:25,872
or has a problem you try to remove the problem.

329
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:30,541
If the person cannot stand, give the place.

330
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:35,345
Try to give from your clean heart.

331
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:40,100
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

332
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:47,938
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

333
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:50,344
which Felicity wanted me to discuss,

334
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:52,064
is how to clean the heart.

335
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:57,439
There is no broom available for that in the supermarket.

336
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:05,792
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

337
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:18,510
But there is a way.

338
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,276
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

339
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:26,281
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

340
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,770
I trust you.

341
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,714
People laugh at Me sometimes. Some of these saints

342
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:34,926
who are supposed to be very great people,

343
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,973
they can’t understand how I trust you.

344
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:41,030
They’d say that oh these are all lost races?

345
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,546
These are horrible people how do you trust them.

346
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:49,212
They are not sanyasis, they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

347
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:52,276
They are ordinary people.

348
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:56,026
For them I mean your value is nothing.

349
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,035
They’ll if you go to them

350
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:02,352
they will make you stand on your head for three months.

351
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,299
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

352
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,940
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

353
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,972
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

354
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,222
The day you came to me I trusted you.

355
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:18,776
And I worked on you from the very first day,

356
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:23,712
knowing what you are but I trust your Spirit

357
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:27,948
that it would shine, in the same way, trust.

358
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:32,776
We laugh at others. I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

359
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:37,656
make fun of them when they come to Me.

360
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,840
Trust them.

361
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,376
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

362
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:50,597
So you have to believe

363
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:58,850
in yourself and enjoy the way

364
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,504
gently you are sweeping

365
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:06,795
into the current of your Mother’s love.

366
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:10,736
Just enjoy that.

367
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:17,231
Like a flower that falls into the current

368
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:23,796
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

369
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:27,640
In the same way,

370
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,226
you should enjoy.

371
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:39,492
When that enjoyment comes into you, you will start trusting.

372
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,296
And trust your Mother.

373
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:50,192
I try many things to correct you.

374
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:54,177
But trust in one thing, that whatever I try for you

375
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:58,116
or do anything,

376
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:03,992
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

377
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:07,692
That’s My job.

378
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,039
May sometimes you might feel I am publicly saying things for you.

379
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,642
May be your images are being ruined by that

380
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:21,992
or whatever you may think. That’s not the way,

381
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:30,608
is for your hitha, is for the well-being of your Spirit.

382
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:39,885
And that is the most difficult job.

383
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,725
With all this,

384
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:51,489
trust in your heart.

385
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:55,937
First trust yourself,

386
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:58,422
trust others,

387
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,215
other Sahaja Yogis.

388
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:03,965
Love thy neighbour as thyself. Who is your neighbour?

389
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:07,097
He is a Sahaja Yogi.

390
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:10,297
Stand by him.

391
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,220
And trust your Mother.

392
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,493
As I have trusted you, you have to trust Me,

393
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,798
and it will work out.

394
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:34,778
Open your heart to this trust.

395
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,299
You should not worry whether it would be

396
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,832
protocolish all right or not,

397
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:52,107
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

398
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:55,380
because heart knows. Whatever your heart will do

399
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,096
in its genuine form will be respectable,

400
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:04,494
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

401
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:08,744
That will look after you. By outer forms,

402
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:13,339
whatever you try is not going to work out.

403
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:18,317
It is that trust in your loving heart

404
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:20,754
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

405
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:23,733
You see today she brought some flowers.

406
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:27,336
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

407
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,793
She went to the station

408
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:33,183
and there she was taking some flowers out.

409
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:36,715
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

410
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:39,742
and they said, “Oh go ahead. They are only weeds you can have them.”

411
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,500
And they are so fragrant.

412
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,773
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

413
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:46,884
They are just weeds.

414
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:50,105
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

415
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:55,977
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

416
00:31:57,352 --> 00:32:01,920
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

417
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,057
and all the breeding that is required.

418
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:12,835
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

419
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,772
is most enjoyable.

420
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:23,241
Today I wanted to tell you something good about Greece

421
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,510
before we start off with the Puja for about ten minutes.

422
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,531
Very interesting things have happened.

423
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:35,647
When I went to Greece, I knew that I had to go to Greece.

424
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:40,733
And they told me that they believed in the beginning in one Mother,

425
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:43,750
in one Primordial Mother.

426
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,054
But after sometime there were some Indo-Aryan people,

427
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:50,281
Indo-Aryan who came down to them.

428
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:52,499
And they said, “Yes there is one Mother

429
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,548
but She has many aspects

430
00:32:54,748 --> 00:32:58,728
and these aspects are expressed as different Gods.”

431
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:02,339
And then they told about all the Gods, which you know of.

432
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:05,519
But they, they later on

433
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:10,456
made them absolutely human type of Gods and they spoilt it.

434
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,574
But still there are certain things so amazing it was.

435
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:17,971
Like Athena is the name of the Goddess, the Primordial Mother.

436
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:23,465
But Athena Atha, Atha in Sanskrit means the primordial.

437
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,432
And they got the word from Athena. And to the water they call

438
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:34,192
Neeru, Nero. And in Sanskrit it is Nira.

439
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:38,038
My name is at home is I am called as Nira,

440
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:41,387
means from water.

441
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:49,302
It’s very surprising how many words there are,

442
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:52,746
like I said – told them about the centers. They said, “Kendro,”

443
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:56,115
in Sanskrit it is Kendra.

444
00:33:56,315 --> 00:34:01,180
But the best was in Delphi when I went,

445
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,680
we were surprised at something they said,

446
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,449
“That it is the navel of the universe”.

447
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:18,625
I said, “Europe is the liver and Greece is the navel.”

448
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:22,669
They showed a point that is the navel it was vibrating.

449
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:26,507
And not only that but they showed the most remarkable thing

450
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:30,163
was that this is the mound,

451
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:36,803
which is actually the expression of the navel is the mound

452
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:39,349
which is actually has come out the Mother Earth

453
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:41,489
is the one this one.

454
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:44,405
And this is actually Athena according to them.

455
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:48,266
This is that has come out of the Mother Earth.

456
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:51,298
I saw the vibrations were tremendous.

457
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:54,462
And next to that there were lot of vibrations coming

458
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:57,980
so I turned round and what I find? Is a Ganesha,

459
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:05,092
absolute Ganesha there sitting down with a beautiful trunk,

460
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:10,103
the face and the ears and the eyes, and the stomach!

461
00:35:10,303 --> 00:35:12,104
Can you believe it?

462
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:16,268
Sitting next to Her and absolutely the vibrations coming.

463
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:19,778
I mean I didn’t have a photograph I mean camera or anything

464
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:21,559
otherwise I would have taken a photograph

465
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,858
but now if you go and you can see.

466
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:27,787
Another thing is they showed the egg, just imagine,

467
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:32,599
and the eternal egg from where the other eggs come out you see!

468
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,037
And the eggs are shown divided the same way into spindles

469
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:40,176
as they do which doctors know they have seen under microscope.

470
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:44,754
But how did they see, those Greeks? God only knows.

471
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:47,940
But there’s another side to it.

472
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,538
First they use to get Amruta. t.

473
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:55,819
Is the one that was meant for the Gods

474
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:59,007
by which they were given eternal life

475
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:03,952
in the sense they were appointed as permanent features you see.

476
00:36:04,152 --> 00:36:08,176
But then the same thing they wanted everybody to have

477
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:11,723
so they started using some that was called as ambrosia.

478
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:14,059
They converted into something else

479
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,478
and they started calling it Ambrosia

480
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:19,814
and some sort of a LSD business.

481
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:22,425
So also, they went into trance

482
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:26,667
so the rest of it is all supra-conscious.

483
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:30,031
And that supra-conscious also side by side exists.

484
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:33,234
Now discretion has to be used

485
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:37,431
how around reality always supra-conscious

486
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:42,880
or collective subconscious works out, one way or the other.

487
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,106
And you have to go to the point where the reality exists.

488
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:49,606
But what happens you get lost into the supra-conscious

489
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:53,633
or you get lost into the superego or we can say the,

490
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,977
the collective subconscious area.

491
00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:59,341
So you see both things are to be found out,

492
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:01,571
Like an Indian temple, you go,

493
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:04,773
you’ll find all surrounded by collective subconscious.

494
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,244
Too much ritualism, ritualistic,

495
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:09,681
ritualism takes them to the left side.

496
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:17,895
With that they go to the problem of getting all these women

497
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:22,387
who get spirits, they go on, “hoohoohoo” before the deities,

498
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:28,025
and then they tell the name of the horse and all those things.

1
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:32,294
In Mahalakshmi’ s temple, which is a real temple,

2
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:35,059
where all the three deities have come out in Bombay

3
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:38,192
where I used to live very close to that place,

4
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:42,880
just imagine, and this is very common.

5
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,724
So to understand how human beings reacted to that

6
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:50,452
is very well shown in Delphi.

7
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:53,621
It’s a beautiful thing is so done.

8
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:57,077
But I was amazed at the Temple of Athena when we went there.

9
00:37:57,077 --> 00:38:00,405
It’s so much so near to the thing that

10
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:05,061
the Mooladhara is shown there where the Kundalini exists.

11
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,444
Now She is the one who has snakes around Her, see?

12
00:38:08,444 --> 00:38:11,764
And She has little, little snakes as Her children. Can you imagine?

13
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:15,200
And She is one, and She has a daughter,

14
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,595
which is the Kundalini in you and a God who is a child God.

15
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:25,103
And when She stands She has a Kundalini in her hand,

16
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:28,878
the snake coming out of Her hand. With all the charkas, she is made.

17
00:38:29,078 --> 00:38:31,291
It’s so beautifully shown.

18
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,516
The best was Her Sanctum Sanctorum

19
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:37,608
where nobody is allowed to go inside where She resides,

20
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:40,005
is the Adi Kundalini.

21
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:48,275
But they say that She came out of the head of Zeus,

22
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:53,636
the Primordial Kundalini. And Her place nobody can go inside,

23
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:57,895
nobody can reach except for Her son, the child son.

24
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:01,239
But Her,

25
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,676
Her steps are very large

26
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,604
also are roundish. She curved. Can you imagine?

27
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:12,638
They’re curved as if part of the Kundalas they are.

28
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:20,328
And they are 3 ½ in height,

29
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:24,364
you can see that, in height and in width also.

30
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:27,253
Like every place is made of big,

31
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:30,587
I mean the three are made of big stones and the last one

32
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:34,950
is made of the small, three and a half, and they go in a curve.

33
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:40,315
And that is Sanctum Sanctorum nobody can go inside.

34
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:45,753
Now what an expression it was. This was the early Expression

35
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:49,348
and Athens is after Her name Athena.

36
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:53,477
If you see the face also you will find your Mother very much there.

37
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:56,294
I’ve got the photographs and all that which I will show you later on.

38
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:59,509
But what I’m saying the Mother Earth has done Her job.

39
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:06,310
People have done their job. Christ or we can say Mohammed

40
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,969
or Buddha, Kabira, anyone of them;

41
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:15,981
they have done their jobs, alright. They have worked for you.

42
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:19,505
They have created places within you. They have done their job.

43
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:25,222
Now it is you who are on the stage, not Me.

44
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:31,531
Sahastrara has to work it out.

45
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:36,690
And Sahastrara always surrounds the heart.

46
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:43,428
You are enlightened by your Spirit, which resides in your heart.

47
00:40:43,629 --> 00:40:50,795
And the whole Sahastrara’s mandalas are around the heart.

48
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:02,633
So as you are now the temple of that Spirit,

49
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:05,351
you are the heart.

50
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:09,216
You have to be very, very assiduous.

51
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:15,304
This is the fourth point, which is again against all Englishmen.

52
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:19,589
They are holidaying permanently.

53
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:22,835
The whole attention is in holidays.

54
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:27,668
At the slightest pretext, they are on a holiday.

55
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:33,708
The word holiday comes from the word holy day,

56
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:38,993
is to do something holy on that day.

57
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:45,790
God took his leave from the whole world for one day

58
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,544
to cleanse Himself and to be in a holy condition.

59
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:51,036
Because you see when you clear other people,

60
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:54,282
when you create something,

61
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:58,749
then you want to have some time to yourself and to enjoy yourself.

62
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,328
That’s why He got this holiday.

63
00:42:01,328 --> 00:42:07,944
Here it is permanent holiday not holy day, holly means hollow.

64
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:10,444
It’s hollow day.

65
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,817
And this madness of holiday

66
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:18,935
is of course I am working out on my level to cut it down.

67
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:26,214
This is the time one has to really get into Sahaja Yoga,

68
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:33,286
to work hard, is the time to give up all your lethargies.

69
00:42:36,547 --> 00:42:41,039
You have to get out of your sleep.

70
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,063
I have seen people – I’ve told, she asked Me that,

71
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:46,466
“Mother we would like to have your puja”. I said, “I know

72
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:50,919
why you want to have puja is good because puja means flooding.”

73
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:55,863
The floods come in, ah everybody feels fine.

74
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:59,879
Some feel fine for a month, some for a week,

75
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:02,633
some for a day, some for an hour.

76
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:06,641
Again, as it is.

77
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:17,584
Because with flooding

78
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:20,870
you feel the water has come inside.

79
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,798
But it should be needed; there should be some depth.

80
00:43:24,798 --> 00:43:31,060
That is not done. Every Sahaja Yogi must do it every day,

81
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,748
is a part of his life.

82
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:39,502
Cleansing is a part of his life. Is just like brushing his teeth.

83
00:43:39,502 --> 00:43:44,193
Even if he does not brush his teeth does not matter.

84
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:49,485
I do not brush My teeth every night. You might have noticed it.

85
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:54,683
I need not brush. My teeth are still solid and I was asking My husband,

86
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:58,358
“When do the human beings lose their teeth?”

87
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:02,930
He said, “You have already passed that age.”

88
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,359
I said, “That means I will never lose My teeth?”

89
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,822
He said, “May not.” But I never brush My teeth in the night

90
00:44:09,822 --> 00:44:14,631
before sleeping as you people religiously do.

91
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:19,905
The most important thing is cleansing yourself every night.

92
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:24,858
Whether you cleanse it with water or rub it yourself with salt

93
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:33,777
or with butter or you do the tratrika, with the flame,

94
00:44:33,777 --> 00:44:35,991
do what you like

95
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:39,587
but you have to pay attention to your cleansing every night.

96
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:43,773
And morning time you have to surrender

97
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:45,972
before doing anything else.

98
00:44:45,972 --> 00:44:51,171
You have to get up early? All right get up early.

99
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:58,155
Do what you like but you have to work hard.

100
00:44:58,718 --> 00:45:05,244
And you have to think every day what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

101
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:13,631
It’s not the same cycle we are going to start you see.

102
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:17,877
Once you have denied materialism you became hippies,

103
00:45:17,877 --> 00:45:20,834
now after coming out of that we are not going to start

104
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:24,925
the same cycle of materialism.

105
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:32,574
This is a new way where we have to go,

106
00:45:32,574 --> 00:45:36,137
where we understand our detachments from things.

107
00:45:36,137 --> 00:45:39,387
It’s all right.

108
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:41,832
We are not going to run away from matter

109
00:45:41,832 --> 00:45:45,070
but we are going to master it. If we get it well and good

110
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:47,578
if we don’t get it well and good, it’s just the same,

111
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,316
makes no difference.

112
00:45:54,946 --> 00:45:58,375
And hard work is needed now, real hard work I tell you

113
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,343
because now I’m going to America.

114
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:03,113
When I am there, there is so much of lethargy;

115
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:08,058
when I don’t allow you to sleep after 6 o’clock even if you try.

116
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:11,042
I’ve done that if you notice,

117
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:15,964
rather difficult for people to sleep after six.

118
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:20,852
But, still,

119
00:46:20,852 --> 00:46:23,829
when I go away you have to really work very hard

120
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:26,423
and keep yourself clean every day

121
00:46:26,423 --> 00:46:29,439
and write it down on a piece of paper.

122
00:46:29,439 --> 00:46:34,106
By the time I come back again I find all my horses.

123
00:46:35,098 --> 00:46:38,576
That’s not going to be this time.

124
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:41,306
Today you have to promise Me that,

125
00:46:41,306 --> 00:46:44,108
that all of you are going to work very hard,

126
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:47,716
cleanse yourself completely. Go all out.

127
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:52,422
After all, this country is not so big to travel.

128
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:57,913
It makes a big impressive. You have seen Australian Times.

129
00:46:57,913 --> 00:47:03,254
I had only one Sahaja Yogi with me thank God, that was Mr. Regis.

130
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:07,930
I was only controlling him. Only one horse I had to control

131
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,017
and he was all right. He behaved very well,

132
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:13,120
otherwise he could have gone off you know.

133
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,509
Anything is possible under the sun.

134
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:20,491
But he behaved very well. He was quite under control

135
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:23,311
and they were impressed by his presence there

136
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:27,450
and they called him serene. Imagine Regis very serene.

137
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,878
And he was very sweet I must say

138
00:47:29,878 --> 00:47:32,926
and he explained to them very well because he is well educated,

139
00:47:32,926 --> 00:47:35,402
he is a doctor.

140
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:38,938
Today I played a trick on him though, I’m sorry for that.

141
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:42,576
It was too much, whatever it is,

142
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:47,263
but he, it worked out and he’s done it well.

143
00:47:47,263 --> 00:47:51,120
In the same way it is you people I have seen it

144
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,217
and said it again and again,

145
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:57,677
that you are the people who are going to

146
00:47:57,677 --> 00:48:00,487
bring Sahaja Yoga on this earth.

147
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:06,366
You are the people who are going to do it. I am nothing.

148
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:17,046
You see now when there is waterfall,

149
00:48:17,046 --> 00:48:21,863
what energy do you see? Nothing, it’s just a waterfall.

150
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:26,177
But when you put it to turbines

151
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:29,970
and take out that electricity from the turbines

152
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:35,700
and then you see them here then you say, "yes there is electricity".

153
00:48:39,018 --> 00:48:44,300
Whatever is potential has no meaning.

154
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:50,927
Whatever is kinetic, whatever is showing has a meaning.

155
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:54,866
And so it is for you

156
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:59,490
to be the showpieces of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

157
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,053
Because some will say

158
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:04,701
that, “Oh you may be, so what,

159
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:07,264
you are a different clan altogether.”

160
00:49:07,264 --> 00:49:12,352
Some may say that,

161
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:14,684
“Oh we can’t believe you.”

162
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:18,001
But they will believe you much more they will believe Me.

163
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:22,811
They will not believe Me at all. They’ll say I’m fantastic.

164
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:26,442
I, I cannot be understood, you see?

165
00:49:26,442 --> 00:49:29,529
So they won’t believe Me, they will believe you.

166
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:33,116
They will not trust Me, but they will trust you.

167
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:35,917
They would not trust Christ but they will trust you

168
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:40,077
because you are one of them.

169
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:45,875
That is why it is important that you should improve

170
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:52,836
in all sincerity, in all truthfulness to yourself.

171
00:49:53,598 --> 00:49:58,717
Become a perfect mechanism of God.

172
00:49:58,717 --> 00:50:01,344
No reservations, should be no reservation.

173
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:05,589
You see thinking, “All right, if I do this much

174
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:08,827
then it’s all right, then I come back.”

175
00:50:08,827 --> 00:50:10,907
This is not all out effort.

176
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:14,907
It seems to be very common you see, ‘cutting corners’ as they say.

177
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:18,918
“Oh this much, all right, should I do this much

178
00:50:18,918 --> 00:50:21,180
or should I do this much?”

179
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,148
I’ve seen very much discretion is used for all these things.

180
00:50:24,148 --> 00:50:29,640
It’s typical you see, “How many people so how many sandwiches?

181
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,064
They will eat at the most two or three

182
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:35,775
what’s the use of making more? So but everybody will not eat three

183
00:50:35,775 --> 00:50:40,314
so make it say two is all right, somebody will eat one.”

184
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:43,314
These calculations, see?

185
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:47,913
Who will eat one? The one who is calculating should not eat at all,

186
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:51,409
then that’s the best way.

187
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:54,648
But it’s all this calculations starts in the mind, you see,

188
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:58,282
and these calculations ruin you.

189
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:04,982
It’s a very tricky path. I know it’s very tricky.

190
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:12,308
But you have beacons before you. Really I tell you, ‘lit’.

191
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:14,752
Nobody had that.

192
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:18,593
And you have got the torches in your hand.

193
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:23,413
And you have a balancing way automatically in built.

194
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:28,714
Just trust in all those things, and if you walk straight forward,

195
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:32,954
straight forward, forget all that is past,

196
00:51:32,954 --> 00:51:37,843
all that is nonsensical. Forget it, you are a different person.

197
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:41,430
I’m sure you’ll rise very fast.

198
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:47,530
And you will be really a living, organized being.

199
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:53,040
All of you put together. Living, organized.

200
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,167
These two are not complimentary ever.

201
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:00,763
Because living is always disorganized,

202
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:03,104
according to human concept like

203
00:52:03,104 --> 00:52:05,312
they will say that this flower comes out this way t

204
00:52:05,312 --> 00:52:08,548
hat should come out that way. That human being’s thinking

205
00:52:08,548 --> 00:52:12,595
but God thinks that this is the wayit is organized.

206
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:19,055
So, living organized means organized in the will of God.

207
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:27,431
That’s how Sahaja Yogi are going to form that nucleus,

208
00:52:27,431 --> 00:52:33,931
that great nucleus, that powerful nucleus,

209
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:40,074
that tremendous source

210
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:45,383
which is going to overthrow all that is nonsensical.

211
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:50,970
It is tremendous, believe Me.

212
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:56,492
May God bless you
