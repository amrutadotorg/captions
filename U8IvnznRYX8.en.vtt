00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:50.761
Today we are celebrating the great event

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:56.087
of the resurrection of Christ.

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:04.883
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:15.469
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:42.524
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:53.891
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

00:01:54.821 --> 00:02:04.950
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:10.595
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:21.106
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:31.154
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:40.066
Of course people knew in India about it,

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:46.288
very few of them, very, very few of them,

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:55.845
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:10.453
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:15.911
and She gives you the second birth.

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:30.622
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:37.753
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:44.584
but people are given great ideas about it

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:57.156
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

00:03:58.024 --> 00:04:01.614
It is the greatest happening for you,

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:07.773
is the greatest event of your life,

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:16.937
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:25.278
All this because also because you desired for it.

00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:40.357
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:52.338
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

00:04:52.956 --> 00:04:56.966
That's already done by you.

00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:04.058
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:10.236
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

00:05:11.763 --> 00:05:20.707
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:28.740
You don't have to do anything about it,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.496
it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:44.965
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:50.573
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

00:05:50.788 --> 00:05:54.189
that how can you save these people?

00:05:54.705 --> 00:06:01.974
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:13.623
One has to understand that this Koran was written

00:06:14.024 --> 00:06:19.170
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:24.447
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:36.519
just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

00:06:37.678 --> 00:06:48.544
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:56.290
and was managed by a person who was not such a great

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:02.108
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

00:07:02.707 --> 00:07:10.635
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.823
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:24.432
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:29.406
I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:37.616
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:40.811
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

00:07:41.162 --> 00:07:43.868
In India we had the same problem.

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:48.780
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.637
and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

00:07:52.707 --> 00:07:59.624
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:05.571
About everything they can twist the words

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:14.594
according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:19.559
This exactly what has happened.

00:08:19.678 --> 00:08:27.385
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

00:08:27.964 --> 00:08:41.653
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

00:08:41.832 --> 00:08:52.563
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:58.910
and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:03.485
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

00:09:03.699 --> 00:09:07.509
All these things were in his mind

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:14.120
and so Thomas had to run away to India
and John refused to write anything.

00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:18.869
Because all such people take charge.

00:09:19.099 --> 00:09:20.974
They become in charge.

00:09:21.157 --> 00:09:28.292
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:32.207
They don't have the right to do it.

00:09:33.738 --> 00:09:38.597
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

00:09:38.686 --> 00:09:44.716
wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:55.850
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

00:09:56.383 --> 00:09:59.598
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

00:09:59.713 --> 00:10:05.254
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:09.777
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:17.195
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

00:10:17.806 --> 00:10:23.051
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:26.049
Books and books were written.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.859
They give big, big sermons.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.872
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:35.938
even My father felt the same way.

00:10:37.065 --> 00:10:43.049
Because all these books came much after,

00:10:43.462 --> 00:10:46.330
the authors of these books.

00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:53.118
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:55.591
They were not spiritual people.

00:10:55.991 --> 00:11:02.696
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:11.602
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:18.683
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:27.209
that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:37.470
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:41.303
who talked about reality, about the truth;

00:11:41.438 --> 00:11:48.681
though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

00:11:49.769 --> 00:12:02.075
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:06.273
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:14.369
to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

00:12:14.512 --> 00:12:26.816
have now coming together, understanding that
they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:36.269
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:46.520
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

00:12:46.782 --> 00:12:52.380
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

00:12:52.514 --> 00:12:55.996
Even among themselves there was no unity,

00:12:56.057 --> 00:13:03.750
and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.802
How can that be?

00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:14.806
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

00:13:14.987 --> 00:13:17.239
They were not collective.

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:22.145
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

00:13:22.392 --> 00:13:29.656
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

00:13:30.859 --> 00:13:38.504
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:45.178
the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:51.347
They had no idea as to what truth is,

00:13:51.633 --> 00:13:59.680
but still a seeker can never find consolation

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:02.862
with whatever exists.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:10.431
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:14.970
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

00:14:15.887 --> 00:14:18.603
In seeking they get lost.

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:25.293
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

00:14:25.555 --> 00:14:29.515
But they should see from their own lives.

00:14:29.634 --> 00:14:36.772
They should see from their own attainment.

00:14:37.207 --> 00:14:40.762
What have they achieved?

00:14:41.244 --> 00:14:44.552
Have they got any experience?

00:14:45.568 --> 00:14:54.766
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

00:14:55.657 --> 00:15:03.340
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

00:15:03.927 --> 00:15:11.459
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

00:15:11.932 --> 00:15:15.810
Now it’s said in the Koran,

00:15:16.065 --> 00:15:19.781
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:24.332
they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

00:15:24.586 --> 00:15:27.290
also many people don’t understand the difference.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.690
One is when the resurrection time comes,

00:15:31.774 --> 00:15:36.912
and the another is when your destruction comes in.

00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:43.312
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

00:15:43.463 --> 00:15:48.663
in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:55.475
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:16:08.281
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:22.996
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

00:16:23.506 --> 00:16:26.046
otherwise they are not Muslims.

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.459
I would not call them Muslims.

00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:33.121
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

00:16:33.876 --> 00:16:38.567
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

00:16:38.671 --> 00:16:44.716
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.455
He should feel the vibration.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:17:02.142
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:07.491
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:17.194
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

00:17:17.315 --> 00:17:20.992
through their vibrations on their hands,

00:17:21.112 --> 00:17:27.436
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:33.888
according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.769
They don't know.

00:17:35.997 --> 00:17:39.199
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:43.250
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

00:17:43.718 --> 00:17:48.334
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:55.668
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.571
clearly, why did He ask people to go round

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.719
that black square stone?

00:18:05.874 --> 00:18:08.154
What was the purpose of that?

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:14.188
Why was that stone so important?

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:22.745
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:27.616
but you can ask the question after all why?

00:18:27.647 --> 00:18:29.853
That's also just a stone.

00:18:29.878 --> 00:18:39.460
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:46.565
So many statues were there made of stone

00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:53.772
and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

00:18:54.179 --> 00:18:58.056
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:04.344
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Meccashwar Shiva.

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:11.500
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

00:19:11.697 --> 00:19:17.417
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

00:19:17.442 --> 00:19:22.482
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

00:19:22.775 --> 00:19:28.068
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Meccashwar Shiva

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:39.633
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:48.340
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

00:19:48.857 --> 00:19:51.417
Same thing with the Christianity.

00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:58.593
Why today is a day they are talking so big
about repentance

00:19:58.758 --> 00:20:06.505
and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:17.557
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
of virtues - so why did they do it?

00:20:17.778 --> 00:20:24.474
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

00:20:24.627 --> 00:20:29.203
Because they were not realized souls.

00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:32.245
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:32.348 --> 00:20:37.434
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.526
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:45.911
or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:50.217
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:50.808 --> 00:20:54.921
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

00:20:55.591 --> 00:20:57.089
Why?

00:20:57.114 --> 00:21:05.527
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

00:21:05.837 --> 00:21:13.068
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:24.612
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:30.998
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:35.368
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

00:21:36.035 --> 00:21:40.341
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

00:21:41.198 --> 00:21:47.533
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:54.119
wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

00:21:56.088 --> 00:21:59.794
I met one man from Kashmir.

00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:03.479
He said that, “Where is the peace?

00:22:04.566 --> 00:22:07.935
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.265
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:18.693
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.632
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

00:22:25.539 --> 00:22:27.917
So I said, it's not Islam.

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:30.942
Islam means surrender.

00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:34.580
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

00:22:34.818 --> 00:22:38.665
We have no protection.”

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:43.123
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

00:22:43.378 --> 00:22:47.306
how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:53.150
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

00:22:53.539 --> 00:23:01.150
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

00:23:01.358 --> 00:23:04.807
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.916
I have read them.

00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:16.968
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

00:23:17.348 --> 00:23:22.861
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

00:23:23.464 --> 00:23:31.372
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:36.647
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:40.027
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

00:23:40.289 --> 00:23:50.676
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

00:23:50.818 --> 00:23:55.601
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

00:23:55.849 --> 00:24:05.649
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

00:24:07.958 --> 00:24:13.052
War is absolutely like madness.

00:24:13.295 --> 00:24:16.174
Even animals won't fight like that.

00:24:16.301 --> 00:24:22.530
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:29.798
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

00:24:29.994 --> 00:24:40.189
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

00:24:41.684 --> 00:24:50.939
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

00:24:51.245 --> 00:24:57.096
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

00:24:57.237 --> 00:25:06.812
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

00:25:07.502 --> 00:25:10.632
Kama means sexual perversion.

00:25:10.835 --> 00:25:13.208
Kroda means anger.

00:25:13.816 --> 00:25:16.730
Moha means attraction.

00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:19.590
Mada means the pride.

00:25:19.939 --> 00:25:24.571
Mathsarya means jealously.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:36.264
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

00:25:36.579 --> 00:25:45.740
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:50.176
out of our reading, whatever it is,

00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:56.120
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

00:25:57.242 --> 00:26:03.741
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

00:26:03.845 --> 00:26:07.781
then you are on sound grounds.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.096
You realize that you have found the truth

00:26:12.302 --> 00:26:18.003
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:20.569
They just drop out.

00:26:20.967 --> 00:26:29.877
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.569
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:43.627
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:50.603
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

00:26:50.754 --> 00:26:55.394
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

00:26:55.951 --> 00:27:04.486
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.372
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

00:27:09.613 --> 00:27:12.174
Why should we offer an egg?

00:27:12.502 --> 00:27:21.047
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

00:27:21.514 --> 00:27:25.372
It can become a small chick;

00:27:25.606 --> 00:27:31.448
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:41.462
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:48.977
you can become a different person, a reformed person

00:27:49.064 --> 00:27:54.759
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

00:27:54.814 --> 00:27:57.079
Why do we give eggs?

00:27:57.132 --> 00:27:59.142
People don't know.

00:27:59.293 --> 00:28:01.313
I asked so many people.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.287
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

00:28:06.534 --> 00:28:10.619
They didn't know why they give eggs.

00:28:11.229 --> 00:28:22.844
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

00:28:23.008 --> 00:28:30.775
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

00:28:31.054 --> 00:28:39.100
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

00:28:39.466 --> 00:28:47.381
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

00:28:47.484 --> 00:28:53.904
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

00:28:54.245 --> 00:29:04.064
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

00:29:04.486 --> 00:29:09.597
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

00:29:09.803 --> 00:29:16.546
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.777
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:29.160
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:40.194
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

00:29:40.219 --> 00:29:43.707
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:49.685
and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

00:29:49.855 --> 00:29:55.852
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

00:29:56.043 --> 00:29:58.262
How clearly He does that.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:04.700
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:09.491
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:15.537
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

00:30:17.156 --> 00:30:29.519
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

00:30:29.723 --> 00:30:35.690
All these things are not put together as
I am telling you; separately,

00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:44.164
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

00:30:44.283 --> 00:30:55.476
that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

00:30:55.936 --> 00:31:05.046
and that was blessed that
“You will be the support of the whole universe.”

00:31:05.201 --> 00:31:09.050
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:19.301
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:26.687
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

00:31:26.782 --> 00:31:31.952
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

00:31:32.071 --> 00:31:39.641
it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

00:31:39.872 --> 00:31:48.805
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

00:31:49.281 --> 00:31:54.789
who is the support of the whole universe.

00:31:55.343 --> 00:32:02.324
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

00:32:02.547 --> 00:32:09.295
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:12.991
it's the moral basis of human beings.

00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:19.051
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.413
not all other nonsense that they have,

00:32:22.588 --> 00:32:31.270
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

00:32:31.494 --> 00:32:37.222
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

00:32:37.556 --> 00:32:45.970
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

00:32:46.446 --> 00:32:55.954
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

00:32:56.275 --> 00:33:07.156
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

00:33:07.514 --> 00:33:13.229
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

00:33:13.976 --> 00:33:20.866
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

00:33:21.341 --> 00:33:26.251
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

00:33:26.557 --> 00:33:31.314
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.435
and how do you have your second birth?

00:33:34.903 --> 00:33:39.788
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

00:33:39.973 --> 00:33:44.765
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

00:33:44.948 --> 00:33:49.578
to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

00:33:49.951 --> 00:33:53.285
and that creates a problem for children.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:57.236
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

00:33:57.348 --> 00:34:01.446
when they are being blessed by these priests,

00:34:02.255 --> 00:34:06.213
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.740
It's very interesting.

00:34:08.827 --> 00:34:13.094
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:17.855
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

00:34:18.092 --> 00:34:22.567
Christ stood for morality.

00:34:24.336 --> 00:34:32.287
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

00:34:32.528 --> 00:34:42.172
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:47.861
Morality is out of question.

00:34:48.473 --> 00:34:55.097
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

00:34:55.859 --> 00:35:01.598
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

00:35:01.801 --> 00:35:10.076
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.283
the support of the world as your leader -

00:35:14.403 --> 00:35:22.029
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

00:35:24.527 --> 00:35:33.996
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

00:35:34.455 --> 00:35:38.002
Out of question!

00:35:38.353 --> 00:35:43.234
He is the embodiment of morality.

00:35:43.378 --> 00:35:51.423
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

00:35:51.892 --> 00:35:56.400
to come to churches, to the temples,

00:35:56.824 --> 00:36:02.324
and allow them to have immoral life?

00:36:02.745 --> 00:36:07.414
What is the atonement for such people?

00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:19.569
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:28.918
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:37.207
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:45.609
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

00:36:45.688 --> 00:36:55.269
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.140
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

00:37:02.406 --> 00:37:09.447
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

00:37:10.105 --> 00:37:18.070
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

00:37:18.125 --> 00:37:22.025
and cannot show your inner light also.

00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:30.405
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

00:37:31.019 --> 00:37:35.256
But people say that we have to accept

00:37:35.368 --> 00:37:40.399
because if you have to have more people for your religion

00:37:40.473 --> 00:37:46.875
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

00:37:49.473 --> 00:37:51.811
And just think of it.

00:37:51.942 --> 00:37:56.709
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

00:37:56.979 --> 00:38:02.820
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

00:38:03.591 --> 00:38:11.682
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:20.699
If your eyes are clean and pure,

00:38:21.023 --> 00:38:30.325
then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

00:38:31.368 --> 00:38:38.790
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

00:38:38.873 --> 00:38:43.666
in completeness if your eyes are clean.

00:38:43.753 --> 00:38:46.169
Just imagine.

00:38:46.779 --> 00:38:56.470
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

00:38:56.828 --> 00:39:01.457
how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

00:39:02.412 --> 00:39:06.693
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

00:39:06.862 --> 00:39:14.231
because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

00:39:14.755 --> 00:39:22.761
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:28.798
that you enjoy your morality

00:39:29.307 --> 00:39:36.540
and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

00:39:37.883 --> 00:39:48.516
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
that the eyes are not clean.

00:39:48.651 --> 00:39:53.555
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

00:39:53.707 --> 00:39:55.977
How can that be?

00:39:56.009 --> 00:39:58.418
How can you do that?

00:39:58.443 --> 00:40:05.424
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:11.808
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

00:40:12.191 --> 00:40:20.252
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:25.791
cannot have lust and greed in them.

00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:32.967
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

00:40:33.547 --> 00:40:43.023
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

00:40:45.498 --> 00:40:49.201
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

00:40:49.289 --> 00:40:53.547
I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

00:40:54.409 --> 00:40:58.955
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

00:40:59.334 --> 00:41:07.115
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

00:41:07.274 --> 00:41:12.874
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

00:41:13.136 --> 00:41:18.525
like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

00:41:18.724 --> 00:41:26.890
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

00:41:27.181 --> 00:41:35.148
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

00:41:35.362 --> 00:41:41.893
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

00:41:42.235 --> 00:41:54.055
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

00:41:54.126 --> 00:42:02.794
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

00:42:03.023 --> 00:42:05.384
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:05.487 --> 00:42:11.184
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

00:42:11.343 --> 00:42:14.361
They think as we are like that, the others are.

00:42:14.414 --> 00:42:19.045
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

00:42:19.212 --> 00:42:30.732
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

00:42:30.859 --> 00:42:39.590
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:47.711
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:56.650
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

00:42:56.705 --> 00:42:59.670
They don't know reality.

00:43:01.177 --> 00:43:05.098
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

00:43:05.123 --> 00:43:08.442
when they said about the four stages that you have.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.309
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

00:43:14.611 --> 00:43:19.166
you have to get into the reality.

00:43:20.017 --> 00:43:22.219
Reality is what?

00:43:22.631 --> 00:43:25.712
It’s not a perception.

00:43:25.895 --> 00:43:31.441
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

00:43:33.982 --> 00:43:41.033
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

00:43:41.246 --> 00:43:50.290
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

00:43:50.607 --> 00:43:56.475
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:01.761
This is real life and you don't indulge into

00:44:01.825 --> 00:44:09.106
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

00:44:09.131 --> 00:44:10.677
No you don't do it.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:15.885
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

00:44:15.961 --> 00:44:22.418
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

00:44:22.474 --> 00:44:29.884
in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

00:44:32.463 --> 00:44:42.153
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

00:44:45.032 --> 00:44:53.457
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

00:44:53.989 --> 00:45:00.233
will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:07.452
It is absolutely part and parcel

00:45:07.658 --> 00:45:12.964
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

00:45:13.509 --> 00:45:19.128
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:21.951
Your hands are speaking - all right.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:33.855
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

00:45:34.176 --> 00:45:38.426
Now you are free, because you have the light.

00:45:38.528 --> 00:45:41.511
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

00:45:41.536 --> 00:45:50.526
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

00:45:50.621 --> 00:45:55.974
that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

00:45:56.101 --> 00:46:00.131
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

00:46:00.314 --> 00:46:05.580
You want just do it, if something wrong
you will not do; if you are doing it

00:46:05.614 --> 00:46:11.649
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

00:46:12.252 --> 00:46:18.243
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

00:46:18.483 --> 00:46:23.814
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

00:46:23.973 --> 00:46:31.306
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

00:46:31.442 --> 00:46:36.952
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

00:46:37.079 --> 00:46:46.163
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

00:46:46.354 --> 00:46:53.582
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

00:46:53.939 --> 00:46:57.140
the other people into a better life?

00:46:57.935 --> 00:47:00.350
That is what you are.

00:47:00.513 --> 00:47:06.008
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:13.890
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

00:47:14.145 --> 00:47:16.955
What you have to know what you are.

00:47:17.043 --> 00:47:24.564
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

00:47:24.939 --> 00:47:29.590
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

00:47:29.689 --> 00:47:35.506
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:41.501
Purity is the basis of your existence.

00:47:42.357 --> 00:47:48.490
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:54.391
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

00:47:54.550 --> 00:48:00.970
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:06.177
that is created out of beautiful minds,

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.078
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

00:48:11.373 --> 00:48:16.888
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

00:48:16.942 --> 00:48:22.470
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

00:48:22.745 --> 00:48:26.094
As I love you, you will love you also.

00:48:26.142 --> 00:48:32.996
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

00:48:33.283 --> 00:48:42.431
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

00:48:42.572 --> 00:48:48.574
and the love that you have flows,

00:48:48.685 --> 00:48:55.335
flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

00:48:55.652 --> 00:49:01.941
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:07.136
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

00:49:07.335 --> 00:49:12.525
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

00:49:12.626 --> 00:49:15.207
Why should we worry about them?

00:49:15.278 --> 00:49:17.720
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:22.535
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

00:49:22.688 --> 00:49:32.390
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

00:49:32.457 --> 00:49:35.177
it's not only a few people.

00:49:35.495 --> 00:49:40.218
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

00:49:40.313 --> 00:49:44.929
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

00:49:44.956 --> 00:49:52.851
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

00:49:53.505 --> 00:50:01.676
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.012
but you can't create that kind.

00:50:05.096 --> 00:50:15.119
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:21.632
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

00:50:21.878 --> 00:50:24.504
It’s a global movement all over.

00:50:25.044 --> 00:50:32.083
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

00:50:32.369 --> 00:50:35.480
They have ruined every religion.

00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:43.744
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

00:50:44.257 --> 00:50:47.287
In Buddhism you give up everything -

00:50:47.462 --> 00:50:54.740
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

00:50:55.169 --> 00:51:02.657
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

00:51:03.496 --> 00:51:10.052
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:16.130
misleading others just taking away everything.

00:51:17.157 --> 00:51:20.718
Then same thing about Christianity

00:51:20.821 --> 00:51:23.824
that you all become Nuns,
you become Fathers, you become

00:51:23.849 --> 00:51:27.602
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

00:51:27.859 --> 00:51:31.379
But there's no change within.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.789
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

00:51:38.878 --> 00:51:41.588
He said, “Because I was jobless.

00:51:42.945 --> 00:51:44.690
I had no job.”

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.690
Baba?

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:48.132
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

00:51:48.211 --> 00:51:49.671
Can you imagine?

00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:57.236
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

00:51:57.563 --> 00:51:59.793
Then what did you do?

00:51:59.967 --> 00:52:06.437
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

00:52:06.855 --> 00:52:11.347
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

00:52:11.471 --> 00:52:18.383
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:24.019
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

00:52:24.154 --> 00:52:30.820
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

00:52:31.001 --> 00:52:38.232
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

00:52:38.598 --> 00:52:46.105
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

00:52:46.859 --> 00:52:50.842
Is that what religion gives you?

00:52:51.057 --> 00:52:53.710
Is that what should happen to you?

00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:56.713
No, it's not that.

00:52:56.857 --> 00:53:03.020
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

00:53:03.045 --> 00:53:05.319
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

00:53:05.319 --> 00:53:11.402
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

00:53:12.581 --> 00:53:17.140
So that changes the whole picture.

00:53:17.687 --> 00:53:24.440
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

00:53:24.697 --> 00:53:32.194
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

00:53:32.358 --> 00:53:37.192
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

00:53:37.217 --> 00:53:40.609
if your husband dies then how many days?

00:53:41.543 --> 00:53:46.931
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

00:53:47.302 --> 00:53:51.653
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

00:53:51.678 --> 00:53:55.364
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:04.113
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

00:54:04.253 --> 00:54:12.705
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

00:54:12.893 --> 00:54:20.017
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

00:54:20.064 --> 00:54:25.007
in charge of higher life.

00:54:25.578 --> 00:54:31.121
They lead such a mundane useless life.

00:54:33.206 --> 00:54:36.400
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

00:54:36.484 --> 00:54:42.524
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

00:54:45.794 --> 00:54:47.501
And I was surprised.

00:54:47.526 --> 00:54:56.749
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

00:54:57.323 --> 00:55:04.843
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

00:55:05.129 --> 00:55:08.257
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

00:55:08.282 --> 00:55:11.792
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

00:55:12.054 --> 00:55:16.064
How much money you earn out of it?”

00:55:16.167 --> 00:55:18.776
He said, “Quite a lot.”

00:55:19.038 --> 00:55:21.293
“And then what do you do with this money?

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:24.162
Do you do anything for the society?

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:26.712
Do you try to improve their lives?

00:55:26.737 --> 00:55:33.274
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

00:55:33.429 --> 00:55:39.901
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.946
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

00:55:44.446 --> 00:55:49.188
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

00:55:49.498 --> 00:55:52.574
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

00:55:52.717 --> 00:55:56.148
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

00:55:56.267 --> 00:56:01.535
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.379
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

00:56:07.338 --> 00:56:10.369
But how can they?

00:56:11.813 --> 00:56:14.193
They are not realized souls.

00:56:14.296 --> 00:56:19.566
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

00:56:19.606 --> 00:56:20.606
What?

00:56:20.797 --> 00:56:27.926
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:30.947
I can't understand.

00:56:31.215 --> 00:56:37.175
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

00:56:37.374 --> 00:56:39.247
So they must respect.

00:56:39.272 --> 00:56:42.984
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

00:56:43.009 --> 00:56:50.609
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

00:56:52.023 --> 00:56:54.153
That is your job.

00:56:54.256 --> 00:56:55.875
You don't have to fight with them.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.749
You don't have to denounce them.

00:56:57.749 --> 00:57:00.870
You don't have to describe them.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:04.710
No need, but understand that you are different.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:08.585
You have the right. You are the authority

00:57:08.799 --> 00:57:11.954
and so with that authority and confidence

00:57:11.979 --> 00:57:15.049
you have to go about and save people.

00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:18.498
You are realized souls.

00:57:18.651 --> 00:57:21.352
You got your resurrection.

00:57:21.384 --> 00:57:27.414
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.091
Why, why this has happened?

00:57:30.178 --> 00:57:36.971
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:42.911
in your hands and take them towards the light.

00:57:43.149 --> 00:57:47.026
This is what is your resurrection for.

00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:56.536
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:01.718
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

00:58:01.803 --> 00:58:04.742
How many people have you given realization?

00:58:04.822 --> 00:58:06.856
How many people you have talked to them?

00:58:06.881 --> 00:58:10.283
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

00:58:10.403 --> 00:58:13.927
and there was some lady traveling with Me

00:58:13.952 --> 00:58:18.875
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:22.532
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

00:58:22.809 --> 00:58:28.357
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:28.584 --> 00:58:34.348
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:58:34.538 --> 00:58:38.866
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

00:58:39.378 --> 00:58:43.760
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

00:58:44.127 --> 00:58:48.913
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:52.356
or to be lost to the whole world.

00:58:52.381 --> 00:58:58.230
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:01.669
That's what you are there for

00:59:02.233 --> 00:59:04.823
and you can do it. Many have done it.

00:59:04.864 --> 00:59:07.185
So many of you have done it,

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:13.834
and I would say that all of you, whether
you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

00:59:15.517 --> 00:59:25.980
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

00:59:26.618 --> 00:59:33.083
And the attention should be only on realization.

00:59:33.468 --> 00:59:38.621
How many people you are going to give realization to?

00:59:38.858 --> 00:59:42.745
How many people you are going to save?

00:59:43.626 --> 00:59:46.690
Is a very simple job for you.

00:59:46.747 --> 00:59:48.728
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

00:59:48.826 --> 00:59:49.876
You can.

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:54.535
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.240
and give them their resurrection.

00:59:57.642 --> 00:59:59.888
You don't have to do anything.

00:59:59.913 --> 01:00:03.157
The life is not that difficult for you.

01:00:03.196 --> 01:00:07.355
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.831
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:18.709
just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

01:00:20.106 --> 01:00:24.624
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

01:00:24.712 --> 01:00:27.565
you are all realized souls,

01:00:27.733 --> 01:00:31.335
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
