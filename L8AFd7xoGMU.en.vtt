00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.480
[FRENCH]

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.480
I was just Shri Mataji, explaining a bit the chakras.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.720
So I explained, I explained the different two sides

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.720
SM:- Two sides
SY:- The right and left side,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.280
the centers of energy

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.280
and that's all I've told.
SM - All right. Thank you.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.280
SY - But we made a beautiful introduction before.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.720
SM - All right.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.680
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.600
The truth can be realized

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.480
if you love someone.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.480
But it should be pure love,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.720
without any lust and greed

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.880
which is a Divine love.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.920
Divine love doesn't expect anything.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.480
You cannot sell it,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.280
you cannot force it on anyone.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.400
It is the purity

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.480
of your being, that starts emitting that love.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.800
For example there's a lamp, which is dirty,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.800
and even if you put a light inside that

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.480
it won't give any light at all.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.520
So the first process that starts in you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.360
of the awakening of the Kundalini

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.720
gives you the feeling of the All-pervading power

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.760
and also gives you a kind of a peace within and a security.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.680
But above all you develop

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.480
a new awareness called as collective consciousness.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.080
This new consciousness is where

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.680
you can feel another person on your finger tips

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.760
and you start emitting yourself

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.480
in vibrations of Divine Love.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.440
But these vibrations are very dim in the beginning.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.480
The Kundalini comes, again falls down,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.920
again attends to the problems in the being.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.720
The problems could be physical,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.400
could be mental, could be emotional.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.720
But the main problem is the spiritual problem

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.560
which is very difficult to eradicate.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.480
But as you start seeing your own problems and blockades

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.800
and feeling on, feeling them on your fingertips,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.600
you yourself correct your own being

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.760
as if you have become your own guide and your own master.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.400
In your own light you start seeing what's wrong with you.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.560
I don't have to tell you that this is wrong, that is wrong.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.480
You yourself correct yourself.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.840
When this process starts of cleansing the purity improves within.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.360
That is your attention becomes very pure.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.280
When you look at something as I told you yesterday

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.320
there's no thought that comes into your mind,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.800
but you become a witness.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.680
But it's not only that.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.120
In collective consciousness

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.600
when you look at something, you pay attention to something,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.600
it gets purified.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.480
That's why Christ has said "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.360
That means in your eyes there should not be any lust or greed.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.800
When you look at people

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.160
then there should not be any lust

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.240
or feeling of greed but just you look at them

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.320
and the purity of your eyes is purifying them.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:18.480
You all are capable of becoming that kind of a strong personality,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.360
the light of Spirit, now enlightened within you.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.840
Spirit first of all gives you the truth,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.920
the absolute,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.760
because the Spirit is absolute.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.640
It gives you the absolute truth into such an extent

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.640
that even if you have ten children and tie up their eyes

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.800
and ask them "What's wrong with this person?"

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.360
they will all raise this finger,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.000
means this finger is burning.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.920
That means that that person is suffering from guilt.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.480
That means this is the center which is catching, here.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.880
So much is the absoluteness of the truth is.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.960
That means our brain captures the absolute truth.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:05.480
Now, our attention becomes collectively conscious as I told you.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.440
Like we see the television,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.640
the play is going on somewhere in the central place,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.480
and we see the television.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.480
So, say I am sitting here and My attention has gone somewhere else

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.000
to some person, maybe to some problem to anything.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.480
But it's not like television, it's more than that,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.480
because this acts through the subtle of the ether,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.480
that when this attention goes to the other end, it acts.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:17.480
It works, it organizes, it sends information everywhere

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.320
and the whole cosmos works it out.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.840
And then the action takes place, instantaneously.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.480
And you are amazed how it works.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.440
You might say it's a miracle

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.320
but everything that is Divine is miraculous to human beings.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.480
It acts in so many ways.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.960
There was - there are so many stories,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.480
Sahaja Yogis will be able to tell you about the miracles.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.560
So this attention has got vibrations in it.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.280
These vibrations are the ones which

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.280
themselves are knowledgeable.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.160
They have the knowledge

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.680
and they know what to do

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.280
and they are connected with the whole.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.880
So the message from them goes into the cosmos

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:52.120
and it's such a beautiful, efficient

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.160
machine, we can say - it's not a good word though,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.880
of energy that

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:06.440
it acts instantaneously in the proper way.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.640
Some people ask Me, "Mother if these powers come into us,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.480
we can use it for wrong things."

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.480
You cannot. If you try, your vibrations will stop.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.560
If somebody falsely says that

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.920
"I am a Sahaja Yogi. I have this power",  is not accepted.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:54.280
He talks about something like that, it is of no avail.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.600
As you cannot force Sahaja Yoga or anyone

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.880
you cannot force yourself upon us.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:19.840
And we don't want dishonest hypocritical people.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.800
You have to become the genuine, the pure,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.640
otherwise how will you emit these vibrations.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:44.000
You are the one who has to do this new revolution.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.040
For any other revolution people had to sacrifice,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.600
had to die, there were massacres

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.720
but in Sahaja Yoga you are blessed all the time, blessed.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.600
And you have to just count your blessings one by one.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.280
You are all the time blessed,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.640
all the time you are given support and help and security.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.360
Every moment you have the sensation of tremendous joy

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.480
and enormous confidence in your righteousness and virtues.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:57.960
But as we are coming from the crowds

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:06.480
suddenly we cannot accept, to be on a hill-top watching the crowds.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.840
Because in modern times we live in Hell.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.640
Like our one foot is in the mouth of a crocodile

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.920
and here you are pulled into a boat,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.920
but if you want to be on the crocodile, or in the crocodile's mouth,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.760
nobody can help you.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.640
If you want to put back your foot into it what can anybody do?

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.480
If you like that way, nobody can force you.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.360
But once you start enjoying yourself,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.680
enjoying the bliss of Divine

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.520
then seldom you want to go back to the crocodile.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:32.680
The conditioning in human beings sometimes can be very strong.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.440
Specially the conditioning of the ego is horrible.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.480
Like to say, "I don't like this, I like this".

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.480
or, "I hate this, I love this."

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.000
When you say that 'I' where is this 'I?'

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.360
You have not known yourself so far.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.360
When you become yourself, you'll never say like that,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:31.840
because you do not react in that manner.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.880
You just watch and see,

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:43.280
absorb whatever is good and discard whatever is bad.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.680
But this discretion has to be established.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:02.280
As there are two energies within us as told by him

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.800
on the left and the right,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.840
we have a tendency to go towards the left or towards the right,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.280
and go to the extremes.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:28.840
In France I think is people want to go to the left all the time.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.920
That is they follow people like Egyptians who think of their death

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.360
and miserable and unhappy, this that.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.320
Such people take to self-destruction.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.280
They do not destroy others

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.600
but in self-destruction they can  do things

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.000
which they know are bad but will go on doing it.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.280
I don't want to say all of them otherwise

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.760
may be half of you might go away.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
As you know too much drinking, smoking, you know it's bad for you.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.360
You see a person coming out of a pub and fainting

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.440
and you want to go in the same pub

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.040
to get the same feeling of fainting.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.720
But nobody dare say "Don't drink".

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.440
It's sinful.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.560
Now, when you get your Realization I don't have to tell you.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.280
You become so powerful

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.480
that you decide for yourself and you never try to destroy yourself.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.480
Overnight people have given up drugs,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.760
overnight people have given up bad habits.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.320
All kinds of nonsensical habits they have given up

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.400
because now they have become the Spirit.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.440
They see themselves

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.680
The left-side is very dangerous in a way.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.480
Beyond the left side resides your subconscious,

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:17.480
then resides the subconscious of your previous lives

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.720
and beyond that resides the collective subconscious.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.400
Beyond that resides all that is gone out of

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.320
the evolutionary process.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:47.360
From there comes the triggering of all these diseases like cancer,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.560
like myelitis - all these muscular disabilities,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.240
muscular dissipation,disability,

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.000
then impotency,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.560
AIDS,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.680
madness, lunacy, epilepsy,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.760
all psychosomatic diseases,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.440
all psychological diseases.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.800
That is the psyche on the left-hand side.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:44.960
And a person like Freud, who was a half-baked man,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.800
himself was a complicated person

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.840
- he had bad relation with his own mother -

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.640
and who died of cancer,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.360
and he practiced on the pathological cases.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.760
Pathos means suffering.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.240
So all left-sided diseases

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.000
which are, which were very few in those days,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.360
and he generalized it

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.720
and he propagated his Freudian theories.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.920
He was given a higher position than that of Christ.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.360
Maybe the Christianity was going on the other side

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.360
of putting too much restrictions,

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.440
calling human beings "sinners".

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.080
Whatever may be the reason

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.760
- one side the dogma another side the licentiousness -

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.560
both are wrong, both are self-destructive

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.600
and they are not going to give you any help.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:40.760
And these two things acted upon the Western people more,

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.000
and they got lost into the left side.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.640
To go to the extreme they started taking drugs,

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.000
and now the Aids.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.880
In Sahaja Yoga what happens that your attention comes to the center.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.000
You come on the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.760
You can see like this My attention is supposing,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.520
is going this side and something pushes it upward like that.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.840
So, when the Kundalini rises

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.840
She brings your attention collected from everywhere,

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.880
brings it upward and pierces through your fontanel bone area.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.640
But also we have very many right-sided people.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.240
They went in other countries and tried to dominate them.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.760
I sometimes say thank God Columbus

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.480
did not come to India, otherwise I would not have been here.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.480
He went to America and finished off all of them.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.400
So this is the right-sidedness when we destroy others.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.920
In that we have a kind of a ego ,

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.360
we think we are better than others.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.560
This is falsehood.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.480
God has not created anybody higher or lower.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.800
God created only one world and human beings.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.520
Only according to the climate we are varied -

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.680
we are different from each other.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.640
And variety is so important

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.480
otherwise we'd all would be just the same,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.840
like military regime of human beings,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.480
or maybe like robots.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.680
But He made us so separate and different

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.440
because we bring beauty in this world.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.800
That life is interesting.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:05.400
One leaf of a tree is not just the same as another leaf.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.000
Just see the tremendous work of art.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.440
In the same artistic way

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.360
He has created human beings in different manners.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.840
But we think we are different,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.000
they are different - this is our own conditioning.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.480
These are all flowers on one tree.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.720
But we haven't got the sense of collective

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.400
that's why we think like that.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.920
We cannot feel the connection with others.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.560
It's like you may form a club.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.720
Like you have club of people who use fork and spoon

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.240
in a different manner.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.760
There are all sorts of funny clubs.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.720
We try to club together,

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.480
artificially.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:48.440
Whatever is artificially we are doing exists in reality also.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.720
We are part and parcel of one whole.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.000
The microcosm belongs to the macrocosm, no doubt,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.480
but it's not the reality with us yet.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.760
It's just an idea.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.560
So under anything you can have a league

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.480
- like somebody has a "red hair league" -

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.800
and then we try to classify them.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:38.000
It's all so artificial and so stupid.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.480
You are part and parcel of the whole

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.480
and you cannot classify yourself as separate.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.600
Like this hand and this hand belongs to this body.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.960
Now if this hand wants to soothe the other hand

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.720
is it doing any obligation on this hand?

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.960
So after Realization you feel who is the other?

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.480
We don't aggress with our hands our nose, do we?

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.880
We don't put our finger into our eyes to aggress it, do we?

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.560
Because the eye is whiter than the finger

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.480
- do we put our finger into it?

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.400
All this aggressiveness is that stupid.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:10.520
If you are aggressing each other you are aggressing the whole.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:19.480
Anywhere you try to do that, you harm the other part of the whole.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.600
Then we start having organization for the whole-

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.640
The Whole World International Organization - this and that.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:44.000
But the people inside that, are they collectively conscious?

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.560
Is that their inner understanding

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:03.400
on their central nervous system that other doesn't exist?

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.000
So this problem also gets solved after Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:23.960
You forget that you are only a Frenchman and nothing more.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.800
Like a drop falls into the ocean and becomes the ocean

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.400
the heart of a Sahaja Yogi becomes so great.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.280
He doesn't see the color of your skin,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.480
color of your hair or your body.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.920
He doesn't see how you sit and talk, what language you know.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.480
He just sees "do you know the language of love?",

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:16.120
of pure love, of Divine love, of vibrations.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.760
He talks in the terminology of vibrations,

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.480
of different centers.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.520
That's what happened to the disciples of Christ,

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:36.360
of they started talking in the language of chakras,

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.840
and started moving their hands

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.400
to raise the Kundalini of other people.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.720
But how this one is also now misused!

00:35:54.200 --> 00:36:01.880
They started a religion everywhere where a person gets possessed.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:10.840
Even in Hindu religion we have people going to the temple

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.880
and get possessed and saying, "ho, ho, ho", like that

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.480
- stupid people.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.800
And they say that Goddess has come in their body.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.480
Mostly they are maid-servants.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.840
That Goddess must have some brains to go into these people

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.840
and all the time they go on making gestures

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.800
of a such a ridiculous nature.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.520
It's not only there, it's happening in all religions.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:06.280
Even among Catholics you find the charisma, charismatic.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.920
Same thing, it is the same thing, it's the possession.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.880
Then the Pentecostals now,

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.440
they are going to Guatemala to poor- these poor people,

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.400
are getting them possessed.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.880
SY - They are going to?

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.600
Guatemala to get them possessed - all these Pentecostals

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:40.840
and they all becoming abnormal people crying, weeping, so annoying.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.560
They look so miserable.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.520
So it is a mass mesmerism.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.880
Is it religion?

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.320
They said, "No, we have become like disciples of Christ."

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.960
They are not even in their own senses.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.280
We had an interesting thing in India once,

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.120
in a village, Indian village.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.480
We had a Pentecostal visitor from America.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:29.000
And we have a Pentecostal church in villages.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.280
And they had given a notice to the teachers saying that

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.560
"If you don't get the blessings of the Holy Ghost this Sunday

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.800
you will have to give up the job".

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.800
And the blessing of the Holy Ghost means you go mad.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.480
You just go on screaming, shouting, going into gesticulations,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.640
all kinds of funny actions.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.720
Now this fellow had no moral courage to act

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.280
this teacher, poor thing,

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.640
had no moral courage to act like a Holy Ghost's blessing.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.120
But he was worried about his job, you see.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:42.000
So, when the sermon was over he got into a big fright,

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.720
and he caught hold of that American old lady

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.480
and put her into a round and round and round and round

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.480
and saying words in our language,

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.240
"You see, now you dance my lady, you dance my lady"

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.480
and the old lady got exhausted and she fainted.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.760
But the surprising thing is

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:23.320
that the gentleman got confirmed as a Pentecostal and got his job.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:37.000
All this kind of stupidity brings bad name to God.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.480
This is not God.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:50.760
God makes you a righteous, virtuous, sensible, dignified person.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.520
He gives you a very subtle sense of humor

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:07.320
and a very magnetic personality which is very enjoyable.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.520
He doesn't make a fool out of you, He doesn't make you insane

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.920
that you land up in a lunatic asylum.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.320
We've got Christ before us.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.280
We've got real gurus

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.800
who were real, not these fake ones in the market,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.480
real gurus, whose lives you can see how sensible they were.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.600
How powerful they were,

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.560
and what they achieved,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.840
how they loved the world, created peace,

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:10.640
how they gave proper laws and regulations to the whole world.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.800
Even sometimes people criticized them

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.840
but they do not know, what is the essence behind their life.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.880
Say for example people say, Mohammad Sahab married so many times.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.000
Because at that time they were on war path,

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.400
people were killing them and there were hardly young people left

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.480
to be married to ladies.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.840
But Mohammad Sahab did not believe in prostitution

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.440
and extra-marital relationships.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.480
So He said "Whatever it is, you marry".

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.720
In America people said "We don't like Mohammad Sahab,

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.800
because He insists on marriage,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:35.000
and we want to have an experience of sex before marriage".

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.720
I said, "Absurd why do you want to have an experience

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.480
before marriage"?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.120
Supposing you have to shift to a house do you say,

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.960
"I must have an experience of the house before I go there"?

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.480
But now the situation is different after

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.480
AIDS have shown their teeth.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.200
They want now people to have virgin husbands

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.440
and virgin wives.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.480
They want to have men and women who are pure.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:37.360
They may not talk about it but they are in a great danger.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.560
And as you know that I'm not afraid of anyone,

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.920
and I very frankly told them in the year 1973

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.600
that if they don't give up these nonsensical ideas about sex,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.480
they are going to have a horrible disease.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.400
And they got very angry with Me

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.400
and nobody would come to Sahaja Yoga

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.640
but they wanted to go to all the false gurus,

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.400
paying them lots of money.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.880
Also they didn't like Me because I said, "You can't pay Me",

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.240
because I could not satisfy their ego.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.480
But today is different.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:43.960
They realize that I had the real concern for their good.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:55.000
When this Kundalini rises within you

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.280
then you see the chakra, the red chakra down below

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.480
which is called as the Mooladhara,

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.760
is the center of your innocence.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.920
Kundalini doesn't go through that.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.400
That chakra is below it.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.400
So one has to understand

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.480
that to achieve God you don't have to go to sex.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.000
There were another type of gurus who came

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:39.160
to say you must take to sex, mass sex to go to God.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.440
What happens to the brains of people,

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.400
when they hear such stupid ideologies!

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.360
If that is the case, all animals must go to Heavens first,

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.640
before than human beings.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.040
If this kind of a nonsense is good

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.880
then why is it people get into diseases?

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.480
The another side is that you shouldn't have any sex.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.840
This is absurd.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.280
It's a natural thing which one must have

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.200
in a very sane and a healthy manner.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.600
It's like saying you don't eat food at all and you'll go to God.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.840
If you fast then you'll go to God immediately.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.800
I mean there are many people who are fasting

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.120
in this world because they haven't got sufficient food.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.400
They must have all gone to God immediately.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.680
In Ethyopia you have so many people who died of starvation.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.480
Are they gone to God?

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:30.480
So (the) another side of it is also another extreme of a nonsense.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.440
And both these things have never helped us.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.360
Once you are a Spirit

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:49.800
you become completely in control of yourself.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.480
No temptations can invade you,

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.880
no one can dominate you

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.160
nor you dominate anyone.

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:11.400
You respect the privacy and

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.200
the liberty of another person as you respect yours.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:30.480
In this we have no sense of privacy and no self-respect.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.400
We have something very private and secret with us,

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.480
which should not be shared on the street and the roads.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.240
People just want to take advantage

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.480
and want to make you into an animal or into a sex point.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:12.720
You are a human being above all the creation of the world.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.440
You are not animals.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.160
You don't have to learn anything from animals.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.480
They have to learn from you if they have to evolve.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.640
You must assume your own powers as Spirit

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.520
and you can see here clearly that the Kundalini rises

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.480
and without any guidance

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.760
from anything else but the Mooladhara,

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.040
the center of innocence.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.800
That's an eternal childhood, the innocence within us,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.160
that's something eternal that does not die.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.000
It may sleep off

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.480
but is awakened as soon as your Kundalini rises.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:31.800
That is the reason why Christ did not die.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:41.560
Because He is the incarnation of that innocence.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:49.520
And innocence is the first thing that was created

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:57.480
and that is the first center in which we have been built.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.240
SY: - Bathed?
SM: - Built.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.480
That's our blessing.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.480
That's what is the biggest auspicious thing we have.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:24.440
The Kundalini rising itself will give you back your innocence.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.520
It will be awakened

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:37.560
and you will know what you have so respectable within you.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.840
You will develop your self-respect,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.960
and your security,

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:54.480
and all the courage that is needed,

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.240
through this power of Divine love.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:10.800
You have to know that the subject is too vast

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.800
and I must have given thousands of lectures

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.600
in the West in English language also

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.800
and many more in India.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.960
So, in these two days I cannot go too far.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.680
But when you get your Realization you become the knowledge.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.760
And you become the joy.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:56.760
But one has to understand that it is a collective growth,

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.400
like on a tree,

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.720
there are many leaves,

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.480
and are nourished by the sap of the tree.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.440
Supposing one leaf wants to be separated,

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:26.360
then a bark develops between the tree and the leaf.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.200
It happens in the autumn,

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.480
and the leaf falls off.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.480
So you have to keep to the collective to grow together.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:51.280
Many people who get Realization stay away from the collective,

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.280
and say, "Mother, we love you very much. We had your photograph,

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:03.920
we were meditating, still we got cancer."

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.480
You have to have nourishment all the time.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.240
You have to be collective.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.400
Firstly, as we don't take money, we don't have

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:29.280
very big palatial places for you to come in.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:41.920
We have humble houses where you can come and meet everyone,

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:50.440
and become a part and parcel of the whole,

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.600
and develop yourself.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.560
You should forget you come from a rich family

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.920
or you are a very big personality. Forget all that.

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.880
Here you are a yogi.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.120
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.880
and all of you are part and parcel of the whole,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.440
and all these ideas of ego must go.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:39.360
All these ideas that I am something, will disappear.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:46.760
Then we'll have a new type of humanity

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:54.800
which will have no wars, no hatred,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.320
but would be completely bathed

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:03.920
in the beauty of bliss, of Divine love.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:12.720
You'll have no problems with your children, with your families

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.240
and you'll reside into the calmness

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:25.800
and the beauty and glory of Divinity.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.280
That has to come,

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.480
that's, is there already coming.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.480
Please, you're invited.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.480
Thank you very much.

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.760
Now we have some time

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:59.520
and yesterday you asked lots of nice questions, very encouraging.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.360
I hope today again you can ask some questions to Me.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.600
Thank you.

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:26.880
-There is a tradition in the Christianity

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.600
to pray with the chapelet (rosary in French).

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.000
and is there a connection with the central canal?

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.960
So, you want to count?

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.760
Only once you take the name of God, is sufficient.

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.840
Because you are not connected

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:56.400
and you are telephoning, you may try. No use.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.480
What's he saying?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.360
He can ask like that only. Just ask.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.520
[Will mot], it's all right, need not be broadcasted. You just tell.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.880
Just tell, please.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.520
He said that everybody has heard a very nice

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.120
and wonderful message tonight

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:08.560
but how can it help somebody who is unemployed?

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.280
SM: - Who is?
SY: - Unemployed.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.480
and who has finished with this aid.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.600
SM: - Finished?
SY: - With the social aid,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.000
which is given and which has started to be depressed.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.760
All right! Now you get employed by God.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:44.200
Firstly I've seen, in England where unemployment is the maximum

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.400
it's difficult to get now any Sahaja Yogi unemployed.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.880
All right.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.600
Because you improve in everything.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.960
You improve in your intelligence, improve in your

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.040
work and in your style, in your technique

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:21.320
in every way you improve so much. You become such a dynamic person.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.240
But apart from that you want to be unemployed

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.360
because you want to be employe yourself to God.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.480
You want to be unemployed so that you can be employed to God.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:53.440
You feel so happy with it, because you have powers to cure others,

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.240
to give them Realization.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.360
You don't think about yourself anymore, you think of others.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.120
You are no more depressed.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.600
There are so many people

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.200
who didn't have the chance to be here yesterday.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.440
But they are not here, what to do?

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.640
You see, it is such a thing that

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.480
for reality there are very few people.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.360
They should be all here to be employed.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.600
You better tell them, all of them, if you meet

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.480
to come next time when I come to Paris,

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.800
and can go to our centers.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.800
So many who were unemployed came to our centers

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.640
and are perfectly all right.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.600
Yes, please. Yes, please.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.040
Yes, please.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.280
Please ask, please. All right, [unclear].

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.800
First of all he want to thanks for this wonderful message , and

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.960
SM: Thank you very much
SY: add a personal question saying but

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:17.800
for somebody who is still on the way

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.520
and on the road for, to God, how can he

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.360
follow the Sahaja Yoga?

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:35.600
If you desire it will all be worked out through cosmos.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.400
But desire has to be honest.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.120
As I told you that vibrations understand everything,

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.480
they will guide you to the right path.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.400
Now, there's a gentleman here. You can speak as it is.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.480
Even if you cannot, just talk to him. Yes.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.280
It's a question and answer together Shri Mataji.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.600
I will repeat it in French because it's very important what he said.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.000
First of all,

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.000
in the introduction I said that the main major religion

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.600
introduced fanaticism and his question is

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.200
that at the origin, base religion,

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.000
wasn't a very pure thing?

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.120
SM: - Of course.
SY: - At the base.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.800
and isn't it the human beings who make

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.640
or build this fanaticism?

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.480
SM: - Absolutely.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.600
I, I will say this as an answer to it.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.360
I always say that all these great incarnations

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.720
and all these prophets were born on the tree of life.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.960
They were living things working the living work of God.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.400
But people took away the flowers.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.640
Said, "This is mine, this is mine." This is fanaticism.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.120
and they are fighting for these dead flowers,

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.920
even out of one flower they picked up

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.480
petals by petals and fighting for these dead petals

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.360
But there's one thing good about all this is fanaticism,

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.480
that they fight among themselves

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.320
and you see how useless they are.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.760
If there is one God why should they fight?

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:37.960
Is very good for you people to see it clearly - it's nonsense.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.600
Anything else now? This lady.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.720
You stand up now. I think there's no need. Is it [unclear]?

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.720
What's he say?

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.280
What's he say?

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:43.000
So he said his question was connected with the question before.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.640
If the...

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.560
So if there are different paths to God

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.520
in the different religions, isn't it the same also,

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.920
which is in this [situation, combining the different paths]?

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.720
But I think that perhaps he thinks too, that everything is the same.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.360
You see I answered you in the second way,

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.480
that if there's a difference, it must create beauty.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:22.360
Variety is to create beauty not ugliness and quarreling.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.920
Also you see they were born at a time, say, samayachar,

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.240
as they call it in Sanskrit language- means at that time,

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.920
according to time they had to mould things.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.960
Now, say at the time of Shri Krishna, He talked of karma,

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.520
that you'll have to pay for your bad deeds.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.480
But at the time of Christ it is no more.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.640
It is no more. At the time of Christ, He died for our sins.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.240
So at the time of Mohammad Sahab

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.920
there's no question of mentioning it.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:31.120
At this time I have to give you Realization

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:38.640
and I have to tell you, counsel you all about Kundalini.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.480
I have to comfort you.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.560
These are My three jobs.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.840
So I'm doing that.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:13:00.440
Whatever was in those days, was discussed and told.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.880
At the time of Mohammad Sahab there was no smoking,

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.800
so He did not talk against it.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.600
But at the time of Nanaka,

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.120
He saw smoking, so He prohibited people smoking,

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.120
as well as drinking.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.800
So the Muslims think there is no harm in smoking.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:47.960
And now, Christ touched the water and it tasted like a grape juice,

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.880
and grape juice is called as wine in Hebrew language.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:05.360
He didn't make wine, the alcohol.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.800
You see, you have to rot it otherwise you cannot make it.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.240
Whatever He made was instantaneous.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.840
Whatever He made was instantaneous.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.840
So how can it be wine? In the wine the fungus has to go in,

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.920
to spoil your livers.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.880
How can He make wine for human beings?

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.000
So the Christians believe there's no harm in drinking.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.760
We have a church next door.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.600
The only activity I see is that the beer barrels are brought

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.680
and emptied and taken away,

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.600
and nobody comes to the church on a Sunday.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.480
Only on Sunday they don't do this activity.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.320
Sunday they don't do this activity.

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.800
Such a mess of God they have made, you don't know!

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.920
In every religion.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.480
-I have a simple technical question.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.480
I noticed that many people here, put off their shoes,

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.440
and they look like your disciples or like

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.640
the Sahaja Yogis.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.560
- Are you an Englishman?

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.040
- No, I am not Englishman but French language

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.480
is for me a foreign language.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.600
What is your nationality, please?

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.920
I'm Lithuanian.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.320
I've been to Lithuania, I've been there.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.440
I've been, Tallinn I've been.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.440
I, I'd like to follow my question,

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.280
its not, not, I'd not (unclear) from question.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.680
I would like to know if that gesture or other technical,

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.080
other form, what is it?

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.400
I'll tell you, it's...

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.120
All right! Everything in Sahaja Yoga has a meaning

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.840
and everything has some great influence, it is.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.640
Now why do we take out our shoes, you see, is a thing.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.200
You see,

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.760
the Mother Earth has a great capacity to suck in our problems.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.520
All the elements have.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.960
Yesterday you must have seen so many of you

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.760
that how from a candle you were getting a cool breeze.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.280
Specially the Mother Earth has got the greatest capacity,

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:43.240
to take out our lethargy, to take down our negativity.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.400
So, when we take out our shoes

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.280
first of all, the feet are little free.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.480
And also the shoes go everywhere

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.680
so they might be carrying some negativity in it.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.800
It has helped a lot,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
wherever people have taken shoes - it works much faster.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.040
That's why we have to take out our shoes.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.320
Gradually you will understand that everything

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.160
that is done in Sahaja Yoga is for your benevolence.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.120
Now, put a logic to it.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.520
Why should Mother ask to take out our shoes?

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.160
I am not going to have a sale of your shoes.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.240
I am not going to gain by that.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.720
So why should She ask?

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.960
Now, there must be some reason as you say.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.120
So you must have that attitude, open attitude of a scientist,

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.760
"I do not know what it is,

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.680
but as a scientist I would like to know."

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.480
Neither you should have blind faith in Me,

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.280
nor you should have

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:42.600
a sort of an adamant view about that "I don't care".

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.720
Adamant view that "I don't care".

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.000
Adamant is - you don't know English - adamant.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.200
What's the...? Anybody translate adamant?

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.960
So, there should not be a denial.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.880
Keep your mind open.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.640
I'm so happy you are from that country,

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.400
because in Russia Sahaja Yoga has started officially.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.280
And especially in Tallinn I met the Mayoress.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.000
she was a, she was a lady who was a Mayor,

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.400
and she told Me that she wants to come to India

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.880
because she wants to know the Spirit.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:01.440
Now I must say I went to Russia and now I know why they denied God.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.720
Actually My, as you know My husband is a VIP

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:19.800
and they wanted us to go to some place wherever we wanted to.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.640
So, we said "We'd like to see some church", because churches

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.480
still have lot of architecture and beauty.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:49.960
So these Russian officers took us to a church of the Orthodox.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:00.080
There was this black order orthodox person - the head of it.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:11.880
He received us all right and we were having our lunch

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.920
and while having the lunch he told us that

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.960
"These are our fasting days and we do not eat meat".

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.600
I said "It's all right".

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:39.360
So we were having lunch, but this fellow was just drinking,

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.040
and he was drinking and drinking and we were amazed.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.800
Now Me and My husband don't drink at all.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.760
So under the protocol, the officers also did not drink.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.440
Ultimately in the fasting,

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.320
the gentleman drank so much that he dropped off.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:20.440
So, these Russian officers said, "Now let's go".

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.200
And he would not even see us off,

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.440
I mean he was just dropped down on the table like that.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.960
And then officers came out and they said, "With due apologies

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.480
let us laugh, because we feel like laughing now."

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.800
So they said, "Now we must tell you the history behind all this".

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:55.720
That the Czar of Russia wanted to have a religion.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.400
So first he sent for the Catholic church.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.040
The Catholic church said that, "See you can drink

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.480
as much as you like, because Christ made water into wine.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.400
Even if you are alcoholic you'll be saved,

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:28.360
but you cannot marry again. You can have only one wife."

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.880
So the Czar said, "That's not possible. We have to have many wives,

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.640
for our political treaties.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.960
So this won't work out".

01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.360
So they sent for the Islam religion.

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.880
Islam said, "Marry many as much as you like but you can't drink".

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.320
They said, "This won't work out with us either".

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.160
So they asked them, "All right,

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.600
then we should have some other religion".

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.000
So they sent for these Orthodox.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.840
They are the most unorthodox people.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.200
They said, "See, you can marry as many women you like,

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.040
you can drink as many times as you like.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.840
As long as you give us sufficient money it's all right".

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.040
So they adopted this religion.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.920
That's why, is this man a godly person, you see him,

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.800
the one who didn't even have decency to see you off.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.040
How can we believe in God?

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:27.480
I said, "Despite all this, God exists". Despite all this God exists.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.480
He said, "Yes, if somebody can give us God of that kind,

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.360
who exists, we'll accept".

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:48.000
And Sahaja Yoga is accepted [instead ?], in Russia.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.280
This is the reaction to the stupidity of religion.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.440
But both are just the same.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:07.440
Whether you accept or don't accept, God exists.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.320
He doesn't disappear because of your non-acceptance.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.560
SY: - Madame

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.280
P: - She would like to ask a question in English.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.320
SM: - In?
SY:  - In English because it's easier for her.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.480
All right.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.280
My question is that, when one achieves

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.480
Self Realization through Sahaja Yoga,

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.720
is it a permanent state or can one loose it?

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.200
Yes, that's a good question.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.160
And I had this question when I had the pleasure

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.720
of hearing You talking, London in April,

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.920
and at that time I wanted to ask this question,

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:28.720
and somehow I couldn't get the opportunity,

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.280
though I wanted [unclear].

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:41.640
You see, as I told you, is the light of your Spirit.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.000
It's about the light of your Spirit.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.080
So when you enlighten the candle,

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.720
in the beginning you have to steady it.

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:09.120
Once you steady it well - it may take only eight days or a month

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.760
then there's no problem.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.640
But that part is very important

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.080
where most of the people fail.

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:31.200
First they feel very nice,

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.600
and then they think, "Oh, it's all right, we'll have it forever".

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.440
And they go back.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.880
But that's why you have to settle into Sahaja Yoga.

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:56.200
You have to master it.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:04.360
Don't have to give anything, except little time to yourself.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:12.680
And you have to come to the centers,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.600
and enjoy the company of other people.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.440
Why sometimes we can feel the vibration very fast

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:45.080
and sometimes it's coming very slowly or it's not coming.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.720
If you start thinking about them they'll stop.

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:50.600
Shouldn’t think about them.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.600
They are there, but you start thinking so you come down,

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.560
your attention comes down to your thinking.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.320
Gradually it grows and steadies itself.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:20.120
Gradually it grows and steadies itself.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:33.400
Now you better get your Realization, you are a powerful person.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.400
You'll get your Realization.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.320
You are a very powerful person. What country you come from my child?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.200
What country he comes from?

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.280
Which one?

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.720
He's coming from Antilles.

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.040
Algeria?

01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:59.520
SM: - What is?
SY: - Antilles, the island near the [unclear].

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.400
SM: - Near where?

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:04.920
The islands near Cuba.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.360
Near Cuba?

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.800
Near Cuba, yes, islands under Cuba.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.200
It's good, good.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:20.680
Vibrations are important for everybody.

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.880
It's good, that's a good area.

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:30.720
Yes, what is it, what did you say? Please.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.640
He wanted to say that

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:48.840
all the priests, even orthodox or Christian are not all alcoholics,

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.320
and some might drive you to God.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.960
They do not.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:02.320
You see, if it's a real religion of Spirit,

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.240
nobody drinks,

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:12.160
nobody is unrighteous.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.560
You are bound by the wisdom of your Spirit.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:25.800
You are bound by the wisdom of your Spirit

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:33.960
You see clearly what is a snake and what is a rope.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:42.040
So, you see, that's the sign, even one person

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.960
who professes to be Sahaja Yogi

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:51.440
and does all these things is no more a Sahaja Yogi.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.280
And imagine, imagine a priest,

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:11.440
that to the head priest. That means there's no Spirit in his heart

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.480
shining, no Spirit shining in his heart.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.120
Yes?

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:42.280
What's it?

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:46.720
Another person who is doing another kind of meditation like TM.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.200
SY: - Can she come?
SM: - C.M?

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.680
T.M., T.M.

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.680
- Can she get her Realization?

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.320
She can, but she has to little bit work it out.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.640
Like by mistake,

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.640
like by mistake instead of coming to this hall

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.920
we go in the direction of the Bastilles,

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:24.320
then you have to take a U turn to come back.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.000
That's all.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.680
Now...

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.920
SY:- When we speak about Realization,

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.240
is there only one time of Realization or are there many?

01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.800
Is there only one way to get it,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.120
or is there a I-way to get it?

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.400
Only one way.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:09.400
I'm sorry, in that God has not differentiated.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.840
That's a living way of sprouting the Kundalini.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.120
There's one more. Now, it's endless.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.760
Now, we'll ask this lady. And see, we'll finish off

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.920
because otherwise what about your Realization?

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.080
Yes, please.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:53.960
SY: - What do you think about Krishnamurti and

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:57.320
about the conditioning, spiritual conditioning.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.960
SM: - Who?
P: - About spiritual conditioning

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.800
SM: - Spiritual what?
P: - Conditioning.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.480
- Conditioning?

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:08.640
Krishnamurti has done it.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.120
I must say

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:18.800
it's better not talk about all this people.

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:26.120
All this talking and talking.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.480
They have really ruined people.

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.560
There are many who can talk like him now.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:49.960
They cannot get Realization, they are not realized.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.160
We have to be honest

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.760
and we have to worry about ourselves.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.480
Supposing your diamond is lost,

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.120
and you have searched it everywhere.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.680
You have wasted your time,

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.200
you have conditioned yourself,

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.720
but the diamond is within.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:30.680
You should find your diamond,

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.440
you should not be identified by all these things.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.640
As a Mother I will just ask one question,

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.840
"My child what did you find?"

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.840
Don't listen to tall stories.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.920
One, achcha now, one more. You ask now. One.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.400
He is a Muslim and he asked,

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.520
just knowing about Sahaja Yoga tonight,

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.200
what is Your advice

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.960
to Muslim, to Christian, to Jewish because in fact

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:04.240
we are coming from the same Adam.

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:10.800
Muslims must know that Mohammad Sahab has talked about Kayama.

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.280
This is the Resurrection time of Kayama today,

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:24.480
- this is Sahaja Yoga,

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.760
which He's talked about, "your hands will speak".

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.880
And why they are fighting among themselves?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.400
What about Christians? Christ has said,

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.600
"I'll send you the Holy Ghost,

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:46.720
who will redeem you,

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.560
who will redeem

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.160
and tell you all about it, counsel you, comfort you".

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.640
What are the Christians doing?

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.920
Are they looking out for a Holy Ghost?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.440
Hindus are told long, long time, 14000 years back, prophesized

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.840
that such a time is going to come,

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.960
that Kundalini will be awakened like this,

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:30.160
because they knew about Kundalini

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.000
and people will be spontaneously cured.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.960
And what stupid thing they are doing.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.560
Nanak Sahab told about Khalistan

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.720
to be established.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:55.160
Khalis means pure people.

01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:59.760
Khaalis means pure.

01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.560
Who are these pure people violent, drinking?

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:14.920
We are making the khaalistan here.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.600
So what should I talk to these people? They are so conditioned.

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.280
They don't want to listen.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.120
- What is the fundamental difference between

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.440
Sahaja Yoga and

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:51.960
Buddhism by the lamas?

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.760
Tremendous.

01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.200
Just the opposite.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:07.400
There is no more reality in their ritualism.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:13.000
Their ritualism. Rituals.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:24.960
What Buddha said was that you must get your Self-Realization first.

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.280
He did not even want to talk of God.

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:36.000
For this reason that unless and until

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.040
you get Realization no use talking of God.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.600
Same with Mahavira.

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.320
So both of them can we call as atheist in a way.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.400
Both of them can be called as atheist

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.880
because they did not talk of God.

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.920
Because they said, you must first get Realization.

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.400
Lamas are just the opposite.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:23.000
They have made statues of Buddha,

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.120
they are worshipping Buddha in a ritual way.

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:34.080
They missed the point completely.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.040
They are not even connected with Buddha.

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:44.480
He gave three mantras, mantras to chant, three,

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:47.920
mantras what is in English I don't know.

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.720
Three, first is,

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:58.040
"Buddham sharnam gachchami",

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.800
that means "I surrender myself to the enlightened".

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.640
Buddha means a realized soul. Buddha means the one who has known,

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:14.080
who is known.

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.960
Zen also means the same.

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.560
Then the second one He said, "Dhamam sharanam gachchami."

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.200
That is the Dharma, that is the sustenance within us,

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:35.600
the ten valencies which exist within us.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:43.800
That's the human sustenance.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.120
And then He says

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:54.840
"Sangham sharnam gachchami", I surrender myself to collectivity.

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.880
These lamas have accumulated so much money with them.

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.480
They have got gold goblets to take their beers,

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.480
and gold plates to eat their food.

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.360
How can they be near Buddha?

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:29.560
Such a person won't take anything from you, nothing.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.600
It's done now. Let's have it.

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.000
Now should we have Realization Madam ?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.240
One thing I must say, any amount of questioning and answering

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:27.200
doesn't give you Realization.

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:37.400
It's a mental acrobat,

01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:42.360
and your Realization is beyond that.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:47.480
Keep your mind open.

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.000
I just allow you to ask questions

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.720
because when I'm trying to raise your Kundalini

01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.160
I don't want your attention to go to a question

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.440
which is not not needed.

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.120
But this is no guarantee.

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:22.880
May be, may not.

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:28.760
It will work, I am sure but still

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:32.720
it's not a mental activity.

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.720
It's a living process.

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.000
If the seed has to sprout it will sprout.

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:57.400
But we cannot force it to be germinated.

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.400
Whatever acrobats we may put, it may, may not.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:19.080
So we should ask for Realization,

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.160
desire for it from our heart.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.040
Because that is our property,

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:36.640
hidden from us, hidden from us

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:41.480
and is in within your reach,

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.440
is within your reach.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:51.480
I'm just here to give you your key,

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:57.360
so you should desire for your Realization.

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:04.400
Then Mohammad Sahab has also said you have to become the pir.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:10.160
Pir, Pir. Pir means realized soul.

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.200
That's what everybody has said

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:25.360
and that's what is the essence

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.440
of all these real religions.

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.120
Now, can I request you to take out your shoes

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.080
if it is not too much of a trouble?

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:55.880
That way French are much humble people, I must say.

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:04.280
All right. Now, those who do not want to meditate

01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:09.760
and don't want to have their Self-Realization,

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.680
should leave the hall,

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.720
to be civil to others,

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.560
because we cannot force it on anyone.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.960
It has to work out on people only who desire it.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:39.240
Is in your own freedom you have to ask it.

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:48.960
So, I would request you, to leave the hall in case

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:53.520
you do not want to have your Realization.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:01.880
And you all have to, for 10 minutes,

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.920
little bit co-ordinate with Me.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:17.440
There isn't much to be done

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:20.240
as I told you.

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.760
Those who got Realization yesterday will consolidate it.

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:35.720
And those who haven't got it, might get it today.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:43.360
Those who have come for the first time also will get Realization.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:51.520
Whether you get it here or not,

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:59.800
you must go to our centers to establish it.

01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:07.640
You have to respect yourself and your Realization.

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:13.000
This is very important.

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:16.920
This is where people fail.

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:23.280
You don't have to pay anywhere, anything.

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:36.320
Now, please put both your feet on the Mother Earth, like this,

01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:46.000
and keep them separate.

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:50.680
Please keep them separate.

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:55.920
Now,

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:04.800
you have to put your left hand towards Me.

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:13.320
You could keep it comfortably on your lap, if you want.

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:22.400
This represents your desire to get your Realization.

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:29.560
The right hand is for the action.

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.440
So we are going to use the right hand,

01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:40.120
for facilitating the Kundalini to rise.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.440
And for that

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:51.880
you have to just follow what I tell you.

01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:02.280
We are working on the left-hand side of your centers.

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.240
So, first of all we put our hand -

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:11.240
- this I'm telling you what we have to do, but you follow Me -

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:15.280
right hand on the heart.

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:27.520
Now, in the heart is the reflection of God Almighty.

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:32.120
Then we take down our hand

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.320
in the upper part of our abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:46.720
Here resides the center of our mastery.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.040
All the great masters, prophets who came on this earth

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.360
have established and substantiated this center.

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.920
Then we put our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen,

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.960
in the left-hand side.

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:26.000
Now, this is the center which is for our true knowledge,

01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:32.080
to be manifested within us of the Divine power.

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:42.440
Now again we go back

01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:46.840
onto the upper portion of our abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.440
Then we take our right hand again on the heart.

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:05.360
Then we take this right hand in the corner of your neck, here,

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:10.280
and put your head to your right side.

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.040
Turn your head to your right.

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:35.240
This center catches when we are feeling guilty.

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:42.560
Today also most of you are catching this center.

01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:48.240
Now, take out this hand

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:54.040
and put it on your forehead across and press it on both the sides.

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:03.600
So, this is the center of forgiveness,

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:08.480
the power of forgiveness.

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.520
Take this hand on the back of your head

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:18.520
and put your hand in such a manner

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:23.680
that you can hold your head which is reclining on it.

01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:33.040
Now, stretch your hand,

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:45.200
and place the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:57.520
and push back your fingers.

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:01.720
Press the scalp

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:08.560
and slowly you move it in a clockwise manner, seven times.

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:23.760
Now, that's all we have to do.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:27.360
But you have to keep your eyes shut.

01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:31.640
Both the feet on the ground

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:35.360
and the left hand towards Me like this, little higher,

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:39.840
little higher like that.

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:46.840
Now, we start off by closing our eyes.

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:52.280
But we are not to open our eyes till I tell you,

01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:59.080
because the attention has to go inside.

02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:03.440
Now don't fight with your thoughts,

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.800
just leave it alone.

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:12.160
Kundalini will take charge of everything.

02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:20.520
All right. Now put your right hand on your heart.

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:28.800
And you must put all your worries aside.

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.720
Also you should forgive yourself

02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:38.440
and should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.520
Now, when your hand is on your heart,

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.680
you have to ask Me a fundamental question.

02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:53.040
If you want, you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother,

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:56.120
whatever suits you, and the question is

02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:02.120
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:22.480
Ask this question three times.

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:42.920
Now with this another question comes in

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.400
that if you are the Spirit you become your master.

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:51.440
So put your right hand on the right side,

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:56.120
on the left side of your abdomen, in the upper part.

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:12.600
Now, so ask another question here three times,

02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:17.040
"Mother, am I my own master?"

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:24.760
Keep your neck straight.

02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:29.320
Please keep your neck straight and sit straight

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:33.120
and do not droop forward or backwards.

02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:10.160
Now put this right hand on the lower part of your abdomen

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:14.760
- on the left hand side.

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:20.640
Here I cannot cross over your freedom,

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:26.160
so you have to ask.

02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:34.720
Please ask, "Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?"

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:41.920
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:49.320
Please say this six times because this center has got six petals.

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.720
Now,

02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:12.200
the Kundalini starts moving with this asking.

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:21.960
To facilitate Her movement in the upper centers,

02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:28.960
we have to put our right hand

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:35.160
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:43.480
Here you have to say

02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.440
with full confidence,

02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:52.040
to facilitate the Kundalini to move

02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:56.960
in this center of mastery.

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:05.960
Please say it ten times "Mother, I am my master".

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:15.600
Say it with full confidence.

02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:44.200
Now we have to know that we are the Spirit.

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:48.880
We are not this body,

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:54.960
not this ego, not this conditioning,

02:05:55.640 --> 02:06:00.320
but in reality we are the Spirit.

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:05.520
Now put your right hand on your heart again

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:11.440
and say with full confidence twelve times,

02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:17.560
"Mother, I am the Spirit."

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:51.080
Now, we have to know also that the Divine is the ocean of

02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:59.640
bliss, grace and compassion.

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:10.440
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:24.360
And we cannot do any mistake that it cannot engulf it.

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:32.960
So, please forgive yourself first of all.

02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:41.400
Put your right hand on the left - hand shoulder

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:49.800
and turn your head to your right,

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.880
fully.

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.520
Now here you have to say with full confidence,

02:07:55.720 --> 02:08:01.560
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.520
Say it sixteen times

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:17.400
and if you still feel guilty

02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:23.640
better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.840
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:40.080
You are entering into the kingdom of God.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:07.920
Now, put your hand on your forehead across

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:13.840
and press it hard.

02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:17.120
Here you have to say,

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:21.120
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:26.920
On your forehead please.

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:31.640
They are not putting it. On your forehead, not on your head,

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:34.920
and press it hard.

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:39.640
Now some may say it's difficult to say,

02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:45.760
but whether you forgive or you don't forgive it's a myth.

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:50.080
But if you don't forgive you play into wrong hands,

02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:55.800
so say, "Mother, I forgive everyone", from your heart.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.440
Now take your hand on the back of your head

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:16.840
and raise, turn your head on it, to rest on it.

02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:28.480
Here for your own satisfaction you can say,

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:32.560
"Oh Divine, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me",

02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:34.400
but for your own satisfaction,

02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:38.040
not to feel guilty, not to count your mistakes.

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.840
You have to love yourself, you have to respect yourself.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.040
You have been created into human-being with great difficulties.

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:13.600
Now, stretch your hand, right hand.

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:22.640
Put the middle of center of your palm, on top of the fontanel bone,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.440
and now press it hard and move it seven times slowly.

02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:46.920
Here also I cannot force you to Self-Realization.

02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.280
So you have to ask,

02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:59.960
"Mother, please give me my Self-Realization."

02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:04.520
Seven times.

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:08.680
Press it hard.

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:16.600
Move it clockwise. They are not moving.

02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:22.520
Seven times. Press it hard.

02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.400
Now, take down your hands.

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:16.800
Open your eyes slowly.

02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:20.160
Put your neck straight

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:26.880
and see for yourself.

02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.760
Now, put your right hand towards Me like this,

02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:38.920
and put your left hand on top of your head,

02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:49.880
and see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:00.840
Higher.

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.560
Little bit here on the center.

02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:07.720
You can bend your head, would be better.

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:19.560
Now, put your left hand towards Me,

02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:24.880
and see with your right hand.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.640
Here, here, here. Put down your head. It's better to bend it.

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:36.960
Some people get it very far also, like a jet.

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.440
Now again put your right hand and see. Bend your head.

02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:03.680
Now, raise your both the hands,

02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:08.880
and ask a question,

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:13.480
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:20.480
"Is this the Brahma shakti or the Ruh?"

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:24.560
Or the Ruh.

02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:31.720
"Is this the all-pervading power of God's love?"

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.080
Put up your head and ask the question three times.

02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.480
Now, please put down your hands.

02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:56.880
Now, those who have felt

02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:02.400
cool breeze on their finger tips or out of their heads,

02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:07.360
or all around them,

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:20.320
please raise your both the hands.

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:33.480
It's good, very good, excellent!

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:36.760
Some people didn't get it.

02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:41.880
Questions should not have been asked so many I think, some of you.

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:46.400
It's too much of mental activity.

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:49.560
But it will work out when you come here.

02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:55.480
I'll work it out.

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:57.960
All right, no more mental, yes.

02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:04.440
Just now, those who want to see Me, can come here.

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:22.040
She's got her Realization, all right.

02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:28.320
Put there the candle. Put this candle...

02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:45.000
SM: - You had, just now?

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.840
P: - Yesterday I felt [big desire] and today [no desire as such].

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:53.520
There was very, very confusing. Also translation problem is there.

02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:56.920
All right, now all right. So now you don't think about.

02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:00.520
Just, just put your hands towards Me,

02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:03.840
and you just say, "Mother You are thoughtless awareness."

02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:05.880
You just say that.

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:26.280
I told you, it is beyond. If you have mental activity, it will stop.

02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:37.200
See!

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:39.440
Better. On the left?

02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:42.440
SM: - On the left?
P:- I'm feeling it in the [bottom] of the hand.

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.360
That's the [bottom] of the hand.

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:49.960
How do I do it to get it up on the head?

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:51.960
That's why you have to come to the center.

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:54.360
They'll make you an expert, all right?

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:59.040
May God bless you! That's happening. Now what about you?

02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.760
Just say "Mother come in my head".

02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:12.960
Keep your eyes open.

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:31.600
Seven times. Say it from your heart.

02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:40.320
What work you do?

02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:48.600
- Academic. Research.

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:50.680
SM: - In what?
P: - In the university.

02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:53.160
Anthropology. Anthropology.

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.920
Anthropology.

02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:00.320
She should ask the question,

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:03.600
"Mother, are You the source of the anthropology?"

02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:07.560
Put your left hand here. Left, left.

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:11.440
This side.

02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:32.080
Better?

02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:37.560
Now you say "You are ", you say "You are", then you'll feel better.

02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:42.040
Say, "You are the source of anthropology."

02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:43.920
SY: - "You are the source."
P: - I ask what?

02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:45.320
SY: - No, you don't ask.

02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:48.640
SM: Now, you state it.

02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:53.560
Then it will work faster.

02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:56.760
That's My place and you, because you doubt Me,

02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:59.720
that's why it doesn't work out there and you need it there.

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:03.120
You shouldn't doubt.

02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:08.520
She always doubts, she can't stop.

02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:11.240
She says that she always doubts,

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.240
and she can't help, she said.

02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:15.800
So that's it. She's catching here.

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:17.520
What can I do to [unclear]?

02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:19.760
Just see, "Mother, You are the source", just see that.

02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:23.760
You just say, just say, "You are the source of anthropology".

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:26.480
So many... Are you all right now?

02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:29.640
How are you feeling?

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:36.040
SM: - He's looking much better now.
SY: - Yes.

02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:38.560
He came at the beginning and he is fine.

02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:41.760
Yesterday night he has been crying a lot.

02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:45.560
That's a, that's a, tears of joy.

02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:48.560
They are tears of joy.

02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:52.080
And he told me that he see it come up

02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:53.560
here on the Agnya.

02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:55.800
Same for yours.

02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:01.000
Thank you very much.

02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:07.440
You felt it? Yes?

02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:11.760
You are all right? [unclear]

02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:16.520
What he's saying?

02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:19.360
I would like You to take this.

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:22.360
Give vibrations to this...

02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:26.400
SY: - To hold this in your hand.
SM: - I've given you vibrations.

02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:28.880
it will get vibrated itself.

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:32.040
Now you are vibrated, all right?

02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:34.440
Are you all right?

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:37.120
Let them say.

02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:40.640
Too much of mental activity, too much.

02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:47.160
Better now?

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.400
You are feeling the cool breeze.

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:54.440
I thought that heat is generated inside my head.

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:57.120
It's getting out or not?

02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:59.760
Yes, therte is activity.

02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:01.680
It will get out. You sit down here.

02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:05.400
You put your right hand towards Me. Too much mental activity.

02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:08.320
Now, who else?

02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.440
She feels a lot of heat.

02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:17.000
Yes, see, it will go.

02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:20.520
Heat has to come out of your head

02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:23.840
You yourself you are vibrated madam,

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:27.280
you don't need any more vibrations.

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:35.160
You are your Self. You are yourself a Spirit.

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:38.680
Ha, now better?

02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:43.600
What's she saying?

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:48.200
You got heat?

02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:52.480
Too much of mental.

02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:55.240
Too much mental activity.

02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:59.080
What's she saying? Yesterday she was all right.

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:04.760
You were all right yesterday.

02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:15.880
What's the thing? What's the thing?

02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:19.600
She wants to thank You, because You always begin in bowing

02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:22.280
to all the seekers of the truth. And she feels herself

02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:25.280
to be such a seeker so she thanks You to bow at her.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.240
Your left hand on you hold like that.

02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:33.160
On the liver, on the liver.

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:36.080
Left hand on the liver, yes, like that.

02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.600
That's it. You are all right.

02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:42.600
You are not only a seeker but you've got it.

02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:53.800
And you have to tell everyone about it. Now, are you better?

02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:58.800
She's feeling cooler?

02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:06.480
On the hands, yes.

02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:10.120
SM: -Here?
SY: -On, on the hands.

02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:12.120
Good.

02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:14.800
On the head, no?

02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.440
And hot on the head.

02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:22.160
Now say that, "Mother, come in my head".

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.480
Liver ?

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:28.240
Come to the center, get your liver all right.

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.840
She is not troubled.

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:34.440
"Come in my head". Again.

02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:40.320
"Please come in my head".

02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:47.960
Cooling now?

02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:55.680
Good. May God bless you!

02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:59.360
She feels, this lady feels quite...

02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:03.000
She feels quite well in the hands but she feels pain here.

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:05.960
You just say, "Mother, please come in my head".

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:08.000
Here is the brother of that lady.

02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:10.960
He was ( unclear)

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:13.840
He is French?

02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:16.800
What's the matter with him?

02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:20.040
No, she wanted him to get his Realization,

02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:22.560
to feel the same joy that she felt yesterday.

02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:25.080
He is very proud.

02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:36.120
Heart is closed.

02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:43.920
Did you say so? "Please come in my head".

02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:47.240
Better now, much better.

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:49.440
Too much of... Are you Indian?

02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:51.240
No, I'm Iranian.

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:55.440
P: - Iranian
SM: - Iranian? Oh, we have so many Iranians.

02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:00.520
Now, better?

02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:02.520
It's not.

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.880
It's coming up.

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:08.640
She feels hot.

02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:11.080
Now you say the same thing.

02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:13.640
Oh, thank you very much, madam.

02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:18.080
SY: - No, from this young girl.
SM: - Oh, I see, thank you.

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.560
Better?

02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:36.240
He, he felt it very lightly,

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:41.480
but he's worrying if it's a mental projection.

02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:44.480
No, no not at all. That's why you are not feeling it.

02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:49.280
Now just ask, "Mother, is it a divine process?" Ask the question.

02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:11.800
Ask the question, "Mother, is this the divine process"

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:15.760
That's the answer.

02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:20.600
Better now?

02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:28.440
Now you have to say, "It is a divine process".

02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:35.640
Then it will work out.

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:44.120
All right?

02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:50.720
You have to recognize.

02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:55.640
Shri Mataji,

02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:59.120
this lady is the mother of Elise.

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:07.680
SY: - She feels very guilty and embarrassed.
SM: - Why ?

02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:13.800
She's struggled with her hands for the last ten years.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.320
What is the problem? What is the problem?

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.560
What is your problem?

02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:25.400
She doesn't feel well inside.

02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:28.400
Guilty you feel?

02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:32.560
She thinks she doesn't go [unclear].

02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:37.920
Just put your hand, left to Me.

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:42.640
- no, no, no just this left should be as this, this one.

02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:47.160
As it is, another on the Mother Earth.

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:49.360
No, no, no.

02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:52.840
There also.

02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:55.880
You put it fully.

02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:05.240
Better.

02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:15.960
She feels all her body warm.

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:30.120
Better now? It's cooling down.

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.320
What about her?

02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.600
What about her? Ask this lady.

02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:51.920
Now you must come to the center to get it permanently there.

02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:56.360
You get the address at the gate.

02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:14.920
So she had the Realization in august but she

02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:18.000
she believes in it but she couldn't feel properly.

02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:19.120
She cut out.

02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:21.600
But does she come to the centre?

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:29.600
Sometimes she came to the centre.

02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:33.520
If she comes, she'll be all right.

02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:40.200
Better now.

02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:46.680
And she? He won't go.

02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:54.080
What about this gentleman? How are you? All right?

02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:58.840
He is now smiling.

02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:17.880
She didn't, she didn't feel the vibrations.

02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:28.440
Left to the right. He's not all right? Not feeling anything?

02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:38.200
She feels peace inside.

02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:51.520
Right hand on the Mother Earth.

02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:54.720
Here. What did you say?

02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:04.880
He feels very ungraceful people and so on

02:33:05.080 --> 02:33:09.120
and he asks how it can help him in his day life.

02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:12.280
He has been to some guru or something?

02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:15.400
No, he said me no.

02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:25.560
He did it.

02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:28.400
All right. So you put your hand on the,

02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:32.440
on the left hand side of your stomach, here.

02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:39.280
Down below, down below. Yes, now, here you have to say

02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:44.800
"Mother, I'm my own master". Just say that ten times.

02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:54.880
He didn't feel anything.

02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:57.640
All right, now good?

02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:06.160
Did you go to some guru or something?

02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:13.000
Two years of Hatha yoga.

02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:16.800
Ask him to ask, "Mother, are You Hatha yoga?"

02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:19.720
The heart catching.

02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:24.680
Better now? Put to the light to him.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.040
Are you all right?

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:30.480
Not feeling well?

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:35.080
Just put your left hand to your liver.

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:37.120
He's badly caught up.

02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:40.440
No, no, left, left hand, left hand.

02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:43.280
That side, press it hard.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.200
Did you ask a question?

02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:03.160
Better now?

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:12.440
Shri Mataji at midnight there is an extra cost of 300 pounds.

02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:15.640
SM: What's the time now?
SY: - Twenty to midnight.

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:19.480
SY: - Twenty to midnight.
SM: - Watch has stopped.

02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:32.080
All right, you are o.k.

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:42.120
Did you say? Did he say that? "Mother, are You Hatha Yoga?"

02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:47.600
What about you?

02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:54.280
What she's saying, that is not cool?

02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:01.960
Come now to the centre.

02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.600
Ask him, that gentleman.

02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:13.520
This gentleman, he has been in TM for six months,

02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:17.480
and he, some friends told him to come here and now he would like

02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:20.560
to know if you want to give him a mantra or what to do?

02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.840
No, no mantra. Where is he come from?

02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:29.120
North of France.

02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:30.960
From where?

02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:36.960
That's so far, that's so far from this place.

02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:40.720
And he's got a Ekadesha Rudra, so ask him has he been to some guru?

02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:42.720
Yes, six months in TM, six months.

02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:44.240
You have been in TM?

02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:46.400
Yes, he has his mantras.

02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:51.960
Forget it. Horrible TM. That's why he's catching on liver.

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:59.560
You ask, "Mother, are You the source of all the mantras?"

02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:04.440
Put your right hand on your left Nabhi, left side.

02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:13.600
Better now?

02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:18.200
What sort of Hatha yoga is this?

02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:26.440
Aikido, Karate, aikido.

02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:29.880
And put your hand on your heart,

02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:34.920
inside, inside. inside the coat

02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.000
and you say, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:45.240
He's willing to ask You if You would like to see

02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:48.680
a picture of his son because he's schizophrenic.

02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:04.000
Will he listen to you?

02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:06.720
Will he listen to her?

02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:11.280
All right, you should come and see them.

02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:14.720
They will tell you what is to be done.

02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:18.960
Better now?

02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:27.480
Did you say that? Better?

02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:33.400
Little freshness in the head.

02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:36.320
All right, it's all right. You just go on saying, "I am the Spirit".

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:39.520
"Mother, I am the Spirit". Just go on saying.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:45.040
You are not the body, for her to know. You are the Spirit.

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:51.040
You should only do this when the Kundalini is rising,

02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:53.680
when there's a problem, in a particular centre.

02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:58.560
All right? Discriminate. Not all the way they do blindly.

02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:03.000
Tell, tell, tell him.

02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:10.840
Better now. He's better.

02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:14.720
Shri Mataji, here is another Columbian.

02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:17.000
You remember this man?

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:19.240
This one is another Columbian

02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:21.920
You got it.

02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:25.600
Columbia is tremendous, I tell you.

02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:29.120
And see, what they told Me, in Columbia,

02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:35.280
they have got the emblem of Garuda on the condor, for the Navy.

02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:44.400
That's on condor, condor.

02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:46.840
So I asked them why?

02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:50.440
So they said their own aboriginal people,

02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:54.080
their Indians, their old aboriginal people

02:39:54.680 --> 02:40:01.680
told them that a God called Vishnu came from India

02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:04.240
on a condor.

02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:12.720
And there's something called El Dorado they have got,

02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:17.240
where they have got all the gold, gold things made

02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:22.200
out of gold is made like Indians.

02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:31.920
And they told that Indian, Indian goldsmith used to come there,

02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:38.720
Indian goldsmiths.

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:50.920
You see, that's why I said Columbia will work out.

02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:01.760
He would like to share his love with You.

02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:13.760
Now, what is it you want child?

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:20.120
Yesterday he didn't feel it and today he didn't too.

02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:24.560
Yesterday you didn't feel? Today also you didn't feel? Really?

02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:27.600
So, you are seeking God?

02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:33.400
What are you wearing?

02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:40.720
St. Christopher.

02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.440
Can you take it out for one minute? One take it out, one minute.

02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:51.840
It's a, You know, here's a tradition,

02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:54.680
we have a chain and a medal for the baptism.

02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:57.800
When you get baptism, you get a chain.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:01.920
One minute take it, one minute.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.200
Look Shri Mataji. How do you feel? Better?

02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:07.040
He's all right.

02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:10.760
The first country I visited was Iran.

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:16.760
It will work out.

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:18.960
Mother, there are many Iranians in Sahaja Yoga,

02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:21.320
one in France and some in Austriaand in Zwitzerland.

02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:23.080
But only thing is you see...

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:25.440
In Italy too.

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:27.800
Now, you just ask the question saying,

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.720
"Mother, please give me the real baptism". Real.

02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:55.520
On his head.

02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:02.800
He's innocent. Now is there. He's got it.

02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:08.040
Now, all right? Got it?

02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:11.120
That's the real baptism.

02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:15.600
Now don't wear it, there's no need.

02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:19.400
You are a realized soul. Now you are really baptized,

02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:21.240
You are a....

02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.000
Thank you. Hello.

02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:25.680
She is the sister of Malika.

02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:28.840
I know, I know . She brought them.

02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:30.400
I'm glad to see You.

02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:33.760
May God bless you! I'm very glad to see you also.

02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:39.720
After such a long time she came back from Lille, you know.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.440
Now, what is it?

02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:49.840
Are you all right?

02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:55.200
Any Sahaja Yogi here?

02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:58.360
Please, please give him Realization - Hatha yoga. Ha, come along.

02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:01.240
Natalie, just take him down.

02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:08.720
He's done Hatha yoga

02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:13.120
Raise him left to the right. Left to the right, he'll be all right.

02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.760
What's he saying? What he is saying?

02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:22.960
Ah, he didn't feel anything yesterday nor today.

02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:29.680
Has he been to some guru or...? Zen Budism.

02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:39.200
Shri Mataji, here is the mother of a Sahaja Yogini,

02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:42.320
who is living in Austria.

02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:47.480
She didn't feel much.

02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:50.480
Zen.

02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:55.680
Ask him to ask, "Mother, is it Sahaja Yoga the zen itself?"

02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:06.240
They just talk and talk and talk. Talking is not. Zen is something,

02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:09.840
Got it?

02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:12.320
See it, see it yourself.

02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:25.200
Coming out, coming out. Just see on his head

02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:29.760
Because of Zen you didn't, you get mental activity.

02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:34.000
You got it, sir.

02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:38.680
This is real Zen, this is real Zen.

02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:41.880
P: - I cannot feel it.
SM: - No, no, it is.

02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.960
Now come and join them. Understand it fully.

02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.880
All right. So what? [unclear]

02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:13.760
What's he saying?

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:16.360
He wants me to ask a question.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:23.560
Backbone problem.

02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:25.960
What do you have?

02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:38.800
He has many problems with his backbone, and with Sahaja Yoga

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.040
it has really improved but he has still sometimes...

02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:43.840
You come and see Me there. I'll put you right.

02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:46.560
Where? In the ashram?

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:55.120
I'll see you tomorrow, in the evening.

02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:01.320
Tomorrow is a problem?

02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:02.480
No, no, no, no.

02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:06.040
Tomorrow evening. You are coming for the program there?

02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:09.040
Now what about you?

02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:14.560
Put your left hand on your liver. Ask her to put her left hand.

02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:18.200
We have to go. Left hand on your liver.

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:22.840
Just ask them to put her left hand on her liver.

02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:30.280
We have to go now, we are sorry.

02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:36.120
Please excuse Me.

02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:41.280
Why don't you all come to the center?

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.360
Get yourself done properly.

02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:54.800
You all become experts.

02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.440
You are all capable of getting it.

02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:08.880
So why not get it? Why? Come along.

02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:11.240
What's she saying?

02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:13.320
I've come to Los Angeles, You remember me?

02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:17.440
In August you gave me [unclear] ...

02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:19.400
Now how are you?

02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:21.560
I'm fine. How are you doing?

02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:24.080
I'm just having problems with my stomach.

02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:27.760
But you don't come to the center. You must come to the center.

02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:30.600
You'll have no problems. You'll solve other's problems also.

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.880
I've been travelling a lot but I've been, I went,

02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:39.880
when I was there in Los Angeles, not every day because [unclear].

02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:43.000
Los Angeles, you come to Worlikar's place.

02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:45.240
Dr. Worlikar, do you know him?

02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:46.400
Yeah.

02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:49.680

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:52.360

Yes, about 7 o'clock.

Thank You.
