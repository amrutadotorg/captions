00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,450
How to Meditate, Bombay
29 May 1976.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:16,500
I told you at Dadar, how in Sahaja Yoga, you first go into the state of Tadatmya(oneness with the Divine).

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:26,570
After the Tadatmya  one can attain the stage of Samipya(Nearness to God) and then Salokya(Companionship with God).

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,500
But on achieving Tadatmya,

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,520
a person’s interest itself changes.

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:44,250
Immediately on achieving the state of Tadatmya, due to his experiences,

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,900
a person does not wish to go down into the state of Salokya and Samipya.

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,250
That means, when vibrations start flowing into your hands

9
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,620
and when you feel other’s Kundalini

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,500
and can raise their Kundalini,

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,500
then your chitta (attention)

12
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,950
goes towards watching other’s Kundalini

13
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,000
and understanding your own.

14
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:25,720
You want to be alert about your chakras and understand other’s chakras.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,920
If you look up towards the sky, you may see – even if there are clouds

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,820
you will see many types of Kundalini.

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,320
Because, now  your attention has gone to Kundalini,

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,270
whatever you want to know about Kundalini, whatever you want to see,

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,600
whatever desires you have,

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
these will be revealed to you.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,220
 Your interest in Kundalini grows

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,020
and all other interests disappear by themselves.

23
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,970
Try to understand thus : As you enter into adulthood, leaving behind the childhood,

24
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,900
you have the interests of your adult life - your job, business, wife, family;

25
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,950
 you take interest only in these and all other childhood interests drop off,

26
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:45,470
old experiences fade away and your attention goes towards new experiences.

27
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Or try to understand this way: Say, a person is not interested in music,

28
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,870
and somehow he has become interested in music, in classical music,

29
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,500
then he is not going to enjoy

30
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,100
any other non-classical music concert.

31
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,550
Your condition in Sahaja Yoga should also be similar.

32
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,470
As regards your other habits and interests,

33
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,620
they are acquired gradually and intentionally cultivated

34
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,350
and hence those interests are deeply imbibed in you.

35
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:38,800
Sahaja Yoga has brought about a complete transformation in you,

36
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,100
– you have come into a state of new awareness,

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
you can now feel the vibrations and other’s Kundalini,

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,750
you can give realization to many people, you have cured thousands of people,

39
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,170
you have entered into a new power

40
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,600
and you are nourished by it.

41
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,500
But in doing all this there is only one shortcoming,

42
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,920
and that is that you have not made any effort and everything has happened by itself, effortlessly.

43
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,270
Perhaps that’s the reason why, although

44
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,950
many people receive vibrations in Sahaja Yoga and also rise to a very high state,

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,750
even then their attention

46
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,300
never stabilizes on Paramatma, Atma, or Kundalini

47
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,920
and it  repeatedly goes towards wrong things.

48
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,820
You had asked me, “What is to be done after getting realization”.

49
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,570
After receiving (realisation)you have to give.

50
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,320
It is absolutely necessary to give after receiving your realisation, otherwise receiving (it) has no meaning.

51
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,320
And while giving, one point – only one small point, must be kept in mind,

52
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,870
“That with this body, this mind (manas), this intellect (buddhi),—that means the ‘whole personality’

53
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,170
with which you are giving such an incomparable thing, that itself should be very beautiful;

54
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,320
your being should be very clean.”

55
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:13,770
There should be no disease in it. If you have any sickness – perhaps there may be many Sahaja yogis having diseases.

56
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:24,170
Before coming to Sahaja Yoga you must be getting worried and wishing that the disease should be somehow cured.

57
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,650
But thereafter the attention does not go onto your sickness and you start saying, “It will be alright, does not matter.”

58
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,300
But it is wrong Whatever may be your problem, even minor,

59
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,560
you can cure yourself by placing your hand on that spot, you can keep your physical side very clean.

60
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,520
There is not much to be done. Just meditate and keep yourself clean, keep your physical side clean.

61
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,050
However, for you I have told you one important thing.

62
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:02,670
As it is said, everyone must go to bathroom and clean oneself after getting up in the morning.

63
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,750
. Similarly, for Sahaja Yogis, it is extremely important to do foot-soaking for at least five minutes, before going to bed.

64
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,560
However highly evolved you may be and even if you may not be getting caught – but it does not matter.

65
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
You must do foot-soaking for at least five minutes. Even I do foot-soaking sometimes,

66
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,240
(although it is not necessary for me) so that my Sahaja Yogis will imbibe this habit. It is a very good habit.

67
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,260
All Sahaja Yogis must do foot-soaking for at least for five minutes,daily. All Sahaja Yogis,

68
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,000
should light a deep(lamp) before the photograph,

69
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,900
apply sindur (vermilion), dip their feet in water

70
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,020
and sit in this fashion opening out both the palms towards the photograph.

71
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,420
If you do this, more than half of your problems would be solved automatically.

72
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,720
Whatever happens, it is not difficult to spare five minutes.

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,350
All should sit like this before going to sleep.

74
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:55,900
That will stop more than half of your catches.

75
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,670
We must get up early in the morning.

76
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,220
Our sahaja yoga is a day time activity, not of night.

77
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
So one must sleep early at night.

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,650
I am not asking you to sleep at 6 pm but by 10 pm all must go to sleep.

79
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,970
You should not stay awake after 10. You must get up early in the morning.

80
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,020
In the morning after getting up early & taking your bath, one must sit for meditation.

81
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,150
In the morning one must sit for meditation.

82
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,070
Like, in our country, we have been getting up early in the morning

83
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,200
and washing up our selves since ages and have been doing it all our lives.

84
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,320
In the same way all sahaja yogis must get up early and meditate in the morning.

85
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,770
 It is a question forming a habit.

86
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,000
But I have seen that for many it is very difficult to get up early at 4am or 5am.

87
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,770
There is reason for that. I have done in-depth study about human beings. It is very joyful to study them.

88
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,600
It is very interesting to see how human beings runs way from himself and argues against himself.

89
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,880
It is quite interesting to see how he gives explanation about himself and makes himself an object of mockery.

90
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,800
Some people tell me, Mother we cannot get u early in the morning.

91
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,250
I say when did you go to sleep last night. 12 ‘O clock. But I had decided Mother, that I shall get up at 4 ‘O clock.

92
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,550
That is impossible. But you must sleep early one day and must get up early next morning.

93
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,550
Then you shall fall asleep early that day.

94
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,450
You do that for 2 or 3 days and your body shall get accustomed to it.

95
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,150
When you get up early in the morning, your receptivity is more.

96
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,050
Not only that, at that early hour in the world also extremely beautiful (vibrations?)

97
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,380
So from the point of view of body I have told you and also that one must meditate in the morning.

98
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,080
 Now how to meditate. Think about it, how to meditate early in the morning.

99
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:29,920
First bow down yourself in your heart. Humble down yourself.

100
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:38,620
If someone thinks that he has achieved a lot or „I am a very big saint”,

101
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,350
then take it for granted that he is a gone case. He is about to go out of sahaja yoga.

102
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:50,700
One should take permission and sit peacefully before the photograph with palms spread out

103
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,620
and with extreme humbleness one must bow towards one’s heart.

104
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,020
One has to ask for forgiveness repeatedly.

105
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,320
So even at that time one must ask for forgiveness that

106
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,800
„O God if have committed any mistake against yourself, please forgive us and take us into meditation".

107
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,840
Then we pray, we forgive all those who have done any harm to us and if we had harmed anyone

108
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,310
then please forgive us ‘O Lord. At this point bring pure emotions in your heart and then go into meditation. Now meditate with your eyes closed.

109
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,080
Now one should not ask for how many minutes.

110
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,020
It is very wrong to ask such questions.

111
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,850
Whether you meditate for 5 minutes or 10 minutes. For five or ten minutes one must meditate with complete oneness of attention.

112
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:18,950
umbly bow down yourself and meditate. But before meditation, one must understand it very carefully,

113
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,150
before meditating give bandhan to the place where you are going to sit for meditation.

114
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,300
Give yourself a bandhan,

115
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,170
give your body a bandhan, 7 times give your body a bandhan,

116
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,400
give that place a bandhan, give bandhan to photograph.

117
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,170
This is not be done in a mechanical way like many people do

118
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:58,720
but with humility and shraddha one must give bandhan as if one is doing a puja.

119
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,570
Do not do exactly like a Puja: ofering, etc.

120
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,700
After that give your ‘Mana’ a bandhan.

121
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,250
Now where is ‘Mana’.

122
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:21,850
You have never asked me, Mother where is ‘mana’.

123
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:32,060
Mana is here. It starts from here. Meaning you must give forceful bandhan to vishuddhi and agnya chakra. Mana has to be given a bandhan.

124
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:44,000
While giving bandhan one must have this thought that O Lord, let us remain in your bandhan and nothing untoward may happen to us.

125
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,200
Bow down with extreme humility. At that time, just assume that you are in witness state

126
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,700
and detached from everything.

127
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,770
Just make yourself detached from everything and meditate.

128
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,400
If you try this daily, it will become a habit.

129
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,820
With extreme shradhha one must meditate early in the morning,

130
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:14,720
may be for ten minutes or half an hour, it does not matter.

131
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,600
While meditating do not move your hands.

132
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:38,250
Just watch the photograph and slowly close your eyes

133
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,570
while meditating and do not move your hands.

134
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,520
At that time whichever chakra is having imbalance,

135
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,700
it can be corrected by just watching that chakra

136
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,520
because as I have said, Divine vibrations are more in the morning.

137
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,750
Now after having purified our chakras,

138
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,750
meditate on your Atma-tatva.

139
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,750
Take your attention to your Atma(Spirit).

140
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:14,150
Nobody has ever asked me,Mother where is Atma(The Spirit).

141
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:21,720
Atma is in our heart but its seat is on our sahasrara.

142
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,900
That is why I had said that bow down to your heart

143
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:36,570
and take your attention to your sahasrara and be surrendered to Atma.

144
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,420
With thought be surrendered towards the spirit. What is the essence of Atma-tatva.

145
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:49,200
Atma-tatva is purity.

146
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,520
One should say, complete Nirmal purity.

147
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,950
Take your attention towards that.

148
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,270
That is completely detached. It is not attached with anything.

149
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,800
Due to your identifications(attachments), you are away from your spirit.

150
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,420
Meditate on Atma-tatva. And this Atma-tatva is Love.

151
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,050
Meditate on this.

152
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:30,350
It is very Great – Atma Tatva is Love.

153
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:40,150
Many religions have established in this world, but nobody has been able to describe Love in any of those religions.

154
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,450
Love cannot be described but Love is that power that is flowing from your hands.

155
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:54,970
This is the ‘Chetna’ awareness that people know as awareness.

156
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,370
But they do not know that this is Love.

157
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,320
They comprehend awareness as any other power like electricity.

158
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,770
But no. Atma-tatva is Love.

159
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,820
By saying one word, LOVE,

160
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,500
you are librated from many bandhans(bondages).

161
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,700
Whatever is false, untruth is against Love.

162
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:36,820
Even if you are scolding someone and telling them about Truth, you are loving him.

163
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,170
You yourself have become Love(Prem),

164
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,170
that’s why by just meditating on Prem-Tatva

165
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,750
you can get into Atma-tatva.

166
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,450
While meditating do not get stuck into any one thought.

167
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:08,750
I am that Atma-tatva.

168
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:15,820
I am that power of God Almighty.

169
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,520
You can say like that.

170
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,500
This way, by just saying 2-3 times you shall feel blessed. Because you are saying the Truth,

171
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:31,370
vibrations start flowing from your being with great force.

172
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,670
Now what should be done in day to day life.

173
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,600
In your daily life, you must know

174
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,650
that the power within you is of Prem-tatva (Principiul Dragostei).

175
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,150
Whatever you do,

176
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,970
are you doing it in love or you are just trying to show off that you are a great sahaja yogi.

177
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,370
If I say something to anybody or if I get angry with someone

178
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,650
then i notice that they he speaks against Me to other sahaja yogis and then he asks me

179
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,550
„why have I lost my vibrations.”

180
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:17,850
If you are indulging in such foolishness then it is better that you leave sahaja yoga.

181
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,020
Only those who are desirous of taking something can stay in sahaja yoga.

182
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,520
He has no right to give Me anything, he only has to accept it from Me.

183
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,220
If he wants to give then when his powers are developed

184
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,800
then it would be very good.

185
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,020
But you can give only when you are able to absorb.

186
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,150
Therefore first learn to absorb.

187
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,170
Try to see your shortcomings.

188
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,200
For our benevolence we should see what we want to give.

189
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,050
We are giving love.

190
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,070
Are we standing in Love?

191
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,100
We fight with everyone,

192
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,750
we argue with everyone, we trouble others

193
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,350
and we think we are sahaja yogis.

194
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,650
We should not live with this falsehood.

195
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:11,150
We should live with ourselves like a mirror

196
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,120
meaning we should watch ourselves all the time.

197
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,520
Like if something is sticking on to my face and you inform me about that

198
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,720
and I can wipe it.

199
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,170
In the same way you should watch yourself

200
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,170
and wipe off anything that is sticking to you.

201
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,120
In your day to day life, you should live a brighter life.

202
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,620
There should be transformation in your face.

203
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:44,670
Your behaviour has to be beautiful. Love should flow from you. If you are an individual without love

204
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,300
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

205
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,000
You should know this.

206
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,900
You have become a sahaja yogi without any desire for it and without proving your worth and I am tolerating you and you are sitting here today.

207
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:03,150
If you cannot improve then please forgive me and stop coming to sahaja yoga.

208
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,240
Such people will themselves go out of sahaja yoga in a few days time.

209
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:14,420
şThose who are devoid of love, those who think they are highly evolved, are useless for sahaja yoga.

210
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,070
Such people should go to other ku-gurus(Fake gurus) and get kicked by them and feel the heat.

211
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,450
Here in sahaja yoga you have come to become instrument of God Almighty.

212
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,070
You should be extremely humble, extremely humble.

213
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,700
You should give up ego completely. Others say one has to take sanyaas(renunciation),

214
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,700
I say first give up your ego. Give up your anger.

215
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,200
By taking out your clothes you have not renounced anything.

216
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,470
Renunciation means giving up anger,lust,attachment,pride greed, jealousy etc.

217
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:58,700
giving up these shadripus(the six enemies) is called sanyaas – sanyast. We are not talking about superficial renunciation.

218
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:12,070
You should be extremely loving and peaceful while dealing with others.

219
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,100
You should be talking about sahaja yoga with your family,children and friends.

220
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,120
Change your friends and acquaintances.

221
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,870
They(sahaja yogis) are your real relations.

222
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:32,650
You should talk to them. They(sahaja yogis) will tell you that we have entered into a new world,

223
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,400
we have new vibratory awareness.

224
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,220
Whenever you travel anywhere ,

225
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,950
like someone was telling me he has come from Rahuri,

226
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,900
that just as we carry our personal items while travelling, we also carry ‘teertha’,

227
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,720
the water vibrated by my feet is called ‘teertha’, and other vibrated items like kum kum etc.

228
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,570
If we find any sick person on the way, we give him ‘teertha’ to drink.

229
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,450
If someone talks about religion we show him Mother’s photograph and tell him about Mother

230
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,320
and that she can give you your self realisation.

231
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,970
They apply kum kum to some and ask them how do they feel,

232
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,150
show them my photo and talk about me and tell them that they can get their realisation from this photograph.

233
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,800
All the time they only talk of sahaja yoga and only think how they can manifest sahaja yoga.

234
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,030
By doing this you shall find your depth.

235
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,820
There are also some people who come to sahaja yoga like they visit a temple

236
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,420
and then they are gone in no time. Due to this they face adverse results.

237
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,920
You will people sitting here, who used to be very sick earlier

238
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,670
but ever since they have received their realisation they have never fallen ill.

239
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,020
They have never visited a doctor after their realisation.

240
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:00,950
They have never taken any medicine either

241
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,070
and there are some old people too, who always used to visit doctors, hospitals and have stopped doing so ever since taking to sahaja yoga.

242
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,600
There are many such examples.

243
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,350
Not only this but they have also helped others.

244
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:24,150
The reason is that whatever is required to be done as a sahaja yogi for one’s health they kept on doing that and got cured.

245
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,370
You should all meet each other. Among yourself you are all doctors and all are patients.

246
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,400
Just as doctors do not take fees from one another. In the same way, you also do not take any fees from each other when you help one another.

247
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,660
You should treat other and discuss among yourself and you should not mind.

248
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,960
If someone tells you that your sahasrara is caught up then it is a matter of shame

249
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,000
because getting at sahasrara means being against Me.

250
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,770
Then you ask others to correct yourself and wonder how you got caught.

251
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,720
You should never have anything to do with any person who is against sahaja yoga.

252
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,400
If you do that then your sahasrara is caught up.

253
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,350
 Do not talk to him and advise him not to talk to you.

254
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,270
Do not talk to him and advise him not to talk to you.

255
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,150
Tell him that you are meeting him due to Mother and that he should keep quite.

256
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,350
If you keep talking to such a person

257
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,320
then your sahasrara is caught up and after a few days you will come to me and say, Mother I have got cancer.

258
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,770
One or two persons had it but now they are cured.

259
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,750
You must know that cancer is a disease of the sahasrara.

260
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:40,670
 If you have to be free from cancer then keep your sahasrara pure.

261
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,680
If your sahasrara starts getting caught up then know that it is the beginning of cancer.

262
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,030
You should always keep your sahasrara clean because

263
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,480
 if you do not do so then after a few years you will come and say that you have developed cancer.

264
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:58,800
Then why not keep yourself clean from now. Not only that why not work for sahaja yoga

265
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,750
for which we are in the kingdom of God.

266
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,540
Tomorrow when such people are chosen from this world

267
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,400
who belong to God’s kingdom then you shall be the chosen ones.

268
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,650
Why not do such acts. We are just wasting our time,

269
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,200
meeting friends, having food with relations, criticizing others.

270
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,770
Let’s leave all that and improve our ways.

271
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,370
We should lead such a life that we are remembered for that.

272
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,300
Lets think like that.

273
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:36,070
Nobody should think that he is left with very few years in life and it is difficult to achieve it now.

274
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,920
You shall not die.

275
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,700
When you die you are then reborn and this goes on.

276
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,800
The why not come out of this cycle(of births and deaths)

277
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,670
in a year’s time and if you wish you can do that in a week’s time.

278
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,600
You only have to decide once, just once.

279
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:05,000
You can be immensely benefitted by sahaja yoga just by deciding once like this.

280
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,900
You should be surrendered completely.

281
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,680
It is not necessary that you touch my feet but should be surrendered to me from your heart.

282
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,440
Some people touch my feet but are not surrendered in their heart.

283
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,220
One has to be completely surrendered to Me from within.

284
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:29,620
If you are completely surrendered from within then your kundalini remains established on your Atma-Tatva,

285
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,750
just like the flame of a lamp, without any flickering.

286
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,700
But one must remain surrendered for that.

287
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:53,070
In the surrendered state one experiences Joy, Bliss and God realisation.

288
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:09,320
Sahaja Yoga is a unparalleled, unique & special thing. Please try to understand this and be involved in it.

289
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:21,170
The more you identify yourself with Tadatma(oneness with the Divine) state, the more your Atma-tatva shines.

290
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:30,800
Nothing is important at all, except that you yourself become the Light.

291
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:40,970
 Those who are indulging in nonsense activities all the time are suggested to leave such things.

292
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:50,190
Those things are not for them. I am telling you one last time.

293
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:55,360
Please take note of it and act on it intelligently.

294
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:15,070
Within us lie many evil tendencies, and within us lie many negativities.

295
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,470
 These influence us to do evil deeds.

296
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:25,870
To act under their influence is like becoming Satana yourself.

297
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:32,170
Now it is upto you to either become a Satan or become God.

298
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,000
Now if you wish to become Satan then it is a different thing and I am not your Guru for that.

299
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,450
But if you wish to become God then I am your Guru.

300
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,600
But you should save yourself from becoming Satan.

301
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:53,400
First thing to note is that on the night of new-moon and full-moon,

302
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,020
always there are dangers on your left and right sides.

303
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:07,720
Specially on these two days, that is, the nights of new moon and full moon, you should sleep very early at night.

304
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:15,000
After singing bhajans, bow down before the photograph, meditate,

305
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,720
and keep your  attention on Sahasrara and go to sleep after taking bandhan.

306
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,300
 That means you go into the unconscious the moment your attention is at your Sahasrara.

307
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,650
There, give yourself a bandhan and you are saved.

308
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,620
During these two nights it should be observed particularly.

309
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,350
The night of new moon, you should meditate especially on Shri Shiva.

310
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,450
You should sleep after meditating on Shri Shiva

311
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,200
– that is the Spirit – and completely surrender yourself to Him.

312
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,860
On the night of full moon, you should meditate on Shri Rama and surrender yourself to Him for protection.

313
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:06,720
The meaning of the word Ramchandra is  “creativity”.

314
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,620
You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him.

315
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,850
Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days.

316
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:26,300
However on the seventh and ninth days of Lunar fortnights (according to the Indian Calendar “saptami” and “navami”)

317
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,170
you have my special blessings.

318
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:37,170
Remember that you are specially blessed by Me  on these two days.

319
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,950
Make some special arrangements so that you can have proper meditation on these days.

320
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:16,820
You must do collective meditation only at those places which have been purified by my Feet(where I have physically visited).

321
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:24,540
You should not be doing collective meditation at your home by inviting someone.

322
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:35,000
Even with your relations also you should not be doing collective meditation.

323
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,620
You should be doing collective meditation only wherever I have told you to do so.

324
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:49,700
You should also be discussing about sahaja yoga for a very long time at such a place where I have not put My Feet.

325
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:56,770
Because at such places, bhoots shall start talking thru yourself and you shall start fighting among your self.

326
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,710
I am saying this because even now you are not free from the clutches of Bhoots.

327
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,250
You are not able to know when the bhoot enters into your being and takes over.

328
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,120
This is how you should protect yourself. And whenever you are going out, leaving your home, give yourself a bandhan; always be in the bandhan.

329
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,570
If you come across someone having a catch on Agnya, give him a bandhan, even with your attention it can be done.

330
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,520
Never argue with a person who’s caught on Agnya; it is a foolishness to do so.

331
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,650
Can you ever argue with a person who is caught on Agnya, who is a bhoot ?

332
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:24,100
Do not argue with a person who is caught on Agnya. ‘Never’. Just agree with him for whatever he says.

333
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,220
Go on saying yes,yes, you are right.

334
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:33,020
Because whenever we have a mentally challenged person we only say yes, yes whatever you are saying it right.

335
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,970
Never argue with a person who is caught on agnya.

336
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,370
You should also not be arguing with a person who is caught on vishuddhi.

337
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,050
And never go near a  person who is caught on Sahasrara!

338
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,100
Have no contact with him. Tell him to improve his Sahasrara first.

339
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,270
You should not be hesitant in telling him, “Your Sahasrara is caught. Put it right.”

340
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,000
Sahasrara should be kept clean.

341
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,870
If anyone has started catching on Sahasrara, then he should immediately take help from other Sahaja Yogis,

342
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,300
“Do something and clear my Sahasrara”. If someone who is caught on Sahasrara talks to you, you should tell him, ‘you are my enemy’.

343
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,000
Never talk to him as long as he is caught on sahasrara.

344
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:24,300
As regards a person caught on Heart, you should help that person, as far as possible.

345
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:29,370
Put bandhan on his heart, put your hand on your heart

346
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,170
and take him to the photograph of Shri Mataji. You must take care of heart chakra.

347
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,270
May be, sometimes one may get a problem on the heart chakra.

348
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,970
 You must help others clear the heart chakra.

349
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,570
But many people have no heart ! They are very dry personalities.

350
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:52,500
And you cannot do anything for such dry persons, even if you wish to.

351
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:58,320
So you should leave them alone. However, if they come to you and ask for your help then advise them to first leave Hatha Yoga,

352
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:05,070
and then ask them to leave other unimportant things in life. They should be asked to learn to love others

353
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:10,670
and if they cannot love human beings then they should at least start loving dogs,cats.

354
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,050
Love everyone. Love children. Never aggress on to children. In fact one should never aggress on anyone.

355
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,220
Never hurt anyone.

356
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,270
Nobody should beat the children. No sahaja yogi should ever beat your children with your hands.

357
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,400
Never beat others with your hands, never.  Never get angry with anyone.

358
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,810
Particularly, Sahaja Yogis should never get angry. Without getting annoyed, they should improve everything tactfully and intelligently.

359
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,750
Never get angry.

360
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:39,650
 You must pray for, How should the day to day life of a sahaja yogi be. One should think about it.

361
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:49,250
I have told you in many ways. Similarly this organisation that we have of ‘Anant Jeevan’(Eternal Life),

362
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:58,190
for which eight to ten people should come together and think what is to be done.

363
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:06,270
You must all contribute to it and should give their services for it.

364
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:14,120
All those who still haven’t given their names should give them to Mr Pradhan,

365
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:23,570
and we are going to start a quarterly publication in which all my letters, messages, lectures will be printed

366
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,920
and apart from that if you have any experiences to be shared then do it so that these can also be printed in it.

367
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,350
Whatever experiences we get from all over India, some of them would be printed in that.

368
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:39,000
Therefore if you have any experiences keep writing to them.

369
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,340
Apart from that if you can write an article on sahaja yoga please write and send it for printing.

370
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:50,970
This way there shall be a quarterly in which there will be some articles in Hindi,

371
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:58,760
some in Marathi, some in English, and some in Gujarati.

372
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,350
So we shall be starting printing either together in all these languages or one by one.

373
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,390
Everything happens slowly in sahaja yoga.

374
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,890
For that you must contribute, give your subscription and take advantage out of it.

375
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,860
If you have any questions

376
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,870
on this then raise them and I shall answer all of them together.

377
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:22,220
We are first starting a quarterly which later be a monthly and then weekly and finally daily,

378
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,950
but for now it shall be a quarterly publication.

379
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,050
If you have questions, any problems

380
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,370
then please send a letter in my name to Mr Pradhan.

381
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:36,850
Please don’t write many letters to me as I do not have time.

382
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,100
 After that do not say Mother has written to him and not to me.

383
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:47,350
Do not talk in such foolish ways. Sahaja Yoga is not for such people.

384
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,270
You know that your Mother loves you all equally.

385
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,850
For some reasons I may not write to some people.

386
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,500
Sometimes She writes to you and sometimes not.

387
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,320
Sometimes I write to those whom I know will never mind if I don’t write to them.

388
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,800
And now I am not going to care about those who feel bad if I don’t write to them.

389
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:08,470
I have cared enough for such people and the result is that those evil people

390
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:14,500
have remained that way and never improved and we have been troubled.

391
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,300
All those with whom I have been patient thinking that one they shall improve have not shown any progress

392
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,600
and have remained wicked, they have not transformed even wee bit and we have got the pain.

393
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:28,600
Because I had decided that no human being shall be destroyed in this kaliyuga.

394
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,900
 I shall not torture any human being. I have given him complete freedom to go either to hell or towards God.

395
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,200
I have given you complete freedom.

396
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,690
 If someone wants to go to hell then I say take faster steps towards it,

397
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,080
so that I am free from you.

398
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,300
That arrangement also I have done.

399
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,300
If you wish to go to hell then I have made arrangements for that also

400
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,920
but if you wish to go at the Feet of God, that also is arranged for you.

401
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,800
So I am telling all those who have troubled me, disturbed me

402
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,450
 or tormented me that I have had enough patience

403
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,100
and now if anyone troubles me or disturbs me then I have to say very clearly to such persons

404
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,270
that now we have no relation with you and that you should leave sahaja yoga.

405
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,320
Such elements, while going out of sahaja yoga show their true colors and disturb us again.

406
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,000
Their true nature is exposed. But I have to tell you that you think about your well being.

407
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,420
There is no need to follow them and go to hell.

408
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,700
Think about your own well being. There is no need to argue with anyone.

409
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,500
They shall remain as they were earlier.

410
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,270
They are very difficult to get transformed.

411
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,520
Because they are evil.

412
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,300
Those who are good, they may initially behave like them but get transformed very easily.

413
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,500
Those who are evil are impossible to get transformed

414
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,670
and I have understood this. I have tried enough but such people shall remain as they were.

415
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,670
You can never transform them.

416
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,650
They shall never have wisdom.

417
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,900
That’s why there is no need to argue with such people.

418
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,170
I have to request you,

419
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,300
not to have any kind of relationship with such people.

420
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,420
Slowly they shall be out of sahaja yoga.

421
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:11,500
They are here because they want to destroy whatever you have accomplished.

422
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,920
You should save yourself from such people. Get your vibrations.

423
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,850
There was a person who wanted to give us a house.

424
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,100
This gentleman came to me and took Realization.

425
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,000
But after Realization, he got someone.

426
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,920
The visitor said that in Shri Mataji group are just delinquents.

427
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,820
He received his Realization, he felt vibrations and despite this, believed the visitor.

428
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:39,600
He said then: "I can not give you my house because some things were said ..."

429
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,770
I replied: "All right, give this gentleman the house" Poor fellow!

430
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:48,520
Nobody wants to buy the house now and he loses, called me daily: "Please buy my house. I'm sorry, forgive me."

431
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,650
I repeated: "Did you than to sell this gentleman the house. You are free to do so. "

432
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,070
Now he complains, complains: "Shri Mataji's mad at me."

433
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,850
I'm not mad at all, I said: "Sell your house person who told you all these things."

434
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,350
So all those who think they are very intelligent, if they want to go to hell

435
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:11,050
I can issue them ticket to hell. It is all under my control.

436
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:15,550
All those desirous of going to hell can have the ticket from me and I am willing to give it.

437
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Those who want to go the kingdom of God their ticket also I can issue.

438
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:24,170
 A ticket clerk can issue ticket for any destination

439
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:32,920
but ticket clerk will inform you that if you go this way there will be derailment

440
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,070
and immediately on reaching there your  .... will break,

441
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,400
there is no return from there, you cannot come back from there. Return ticket is not available from there.

442
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:47,050
That’s why I am informing you but I do not have to say much about hell, as you know all about it.

443
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:52,650
I have told you all this so that you can keep your own instrument clean.

444
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,000
And always keep your sight on higher level. You should not keep your sight low but on higher level.

445
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,070
You have to rise higher. Never look down. You have to rise higher.

446
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,950
I am with you at every step, at every place. Everywhere.

447
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,120
Wherever You are, at whichever  place you are, I am with you, completely, in person,

448
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,920
by my spirit and by my word completely.

449
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,170
This is my promise to you.

450
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,200
But those who wish to go to Hell, they will also be sucked down.

451
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,320
That is also arranged.

452
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,700
Therefore be careful. Take to higher life.

453
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,970
Now I am going to London

454
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:39,100
and when I come back I want to see that each one of you should have given realisation to at least ten persons.

455
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,900
Call others, talk to them about sahaja yoga openly. Don’t feel shy.

456
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,600
Tell them about sahaja yoga

457
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,500
how truthful it is. It is the religion of Truth. It is for real.

458
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,370
Gather people,

459
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,650
talk to them wherever you find them.

460
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,880
Everyone of you should take the photograph and each one should give photo in ten homes.

461
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,660
It is a very good way that each person contributes to take ten photographs.

462
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,640
Give these photos to ten such homes where there will be respect towards the photo,

463
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,880
where it will be worshipped and where sahaja yoga can be accepted.

464
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,720
By this way only we can spread sahaja yoga.

465
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,300
We do not want to have much publicity because

466
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,780
whenever we do publicity then dirty people are also attracted and the good people do not come.

467
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:32,970
Therefore it is better to serve sahaja yoga all the time

468
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,600
and make yourself wealthy(spiritually) by it.

469
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,550
May God Bless you.

470
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:44,970
My complete blessings are with you. My heart, mind,

471
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,270
body be always engaged in your service.

472
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,900
I am not away from you even for a moment.

473
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,520
Whenever you will remember me anywhere

474
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,350
 by just closing your eyes , at that moment I shall come to you with all my powers, ‘

475
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:01,800
‘Shankh,Chakra, Gada, Padma Garud  layee siddhari’ ( Just as Lord Krishana came riding on his Condour from Dwarika, with all his Divine weapons – Shankh, Chakra, Gada, Padma when Draupadi called Him – I shall be before you in no time)

476
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,320
Even for a moment I shall not be late

477
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,270
ut you will have to be Mine.

478
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,520
This is very important.

479
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,150
If you are Mine then I shall not be late even for a moment.

480
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,920
I shall be before you.

481
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,870
Let God bless you all and give you wisdom.
