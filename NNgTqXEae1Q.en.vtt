00:00.992 --> 00:05.226
Everybody was feeling very nice when
they came here,

00:05.251 --> 00:09.390
happy and they felt, their vibrations
were all right.

00:09.415 --> 00:13.922
But it was not so.

00:13.947 --> 00:20.186
So be on the alert, you see - ask
each other to check you,

00:20.211 --> 00:23.879
be humble about it. You must go on
checking.

00:23.904 --> 00:26.077
Unless and until you check yourself,
how will you know

00:26.102 --> 00:29.736
what's the thing you are catching?

00:29.761 --> 00:33.683
Ask others to check you and be humble,
very humble about it.

00:33.708 --> 00:41.454
Do not take things for granted because,
unless and until we transform ourselves,

00:41.479 --> 00:47.029
Sahaja Yoga has no meaning to you.
You see, it could be very

00:48.983 --> 00:52.786
material way of expression of Sahaja Yoga

00:52.827 --> 01:00.367
like this radio or this transistor
or this loudspeaker

01:00.392 --> 01:06.914
are just radiating.

01:14.385 --> 01:19.799
We have to know that Sahaja Yoga is not
just to pass energy through us

01:19.823 --> 01:24.106
like all other material things are passing
energy.

01:24.131 --> 01:30.456
This mike is passing the energy, this
transistor is passing the energy

01:30.481 --> 01:36.789
and all other such things are just passing
the energy. Nothing goes into them.

01:36.814 --> 01:44.477
Like a... an artist is singing and the,
nothing passes into the radio.

01:44.502 --> 01:49.684
In the same way, if our power starts
flowing because somehow

01:49.709 --> 01:53.133
the Kundalini has been connected
with the mains;

01:53.158 --> 02:01.356
it has not done its job neither you have
done any justice to yourself.

02:01.381 --> 02:07.124
So you have to absorb that flow
of the Ganges within you

02:07.149 --> 02:13.167
and assimilate it and transform yourself.

02:13.199 --> 02:19.562
The Ganges would be flowing, but if it is
flowing through the

02:20.539 --> 02:26.907
stony area, the stones are not going
to absorb anything from the river Ganges.

02:26.932 --> 02:30.084
But if it is flowing through fertile land,

02:30.109 --> 02:33.667
everybody will be making use of that water.

02:33.692 --> 02:39.496
So you have to make use of your Kundalini
by transforming yourself.

02:39.521 --> 02:42.813
Try to transform. See that how much
you transform.

02:42.838 --> 02:47.848
Now, the expectation about Kundalini
becomes,

02:47.873 --> 02:52.430
becomes so, so

02:56.253 --> 03:00.541
Sahaja - they call it in the very funny
manner -

03:00.582 --> 03:04.777
that people think that Kundalini should
work it out itself

03:04.802 --> 03:09.198
while we are stones on both the sides,
and the Kundalini is going to work it out,

03:09.223 --> 03:13.340
which is very, very wrong idea.
If the river Ganges is flowing,

03:13.365 --> 03:16.579
you have to go to the river. You have
to fill your pitchers,

03:16.604 --> 03:20.715
you have to have beautiful pitchers;
you have to carry them;

03:20.740 --> 03:25.102
you have to bring them home
and then use the water

03:25.127 --> 03:30.778
for enrichment of your food, of your
household.

03:30.803 --> 03:34.244
In the same way, if you cannot transform
yourself,

03:34.269 --> 03:36.641
if you do not, cannot change yourself,

03:36.666 --> 03:40.770
then this Kundalini will be just going
like a thin line

03:40.795 --> 03:46.130
and you'll be catching all the time
and there won't be much progress.

03:46.155 --> 03:49.225
The progress must be shown outside.

03:49.250 --> 03:53.841
Those who think that by saying mantras
morning till evening

03:53.866 --> 03:59.030
they are going to achieve much, they are
sadly mistaken; it's all mechanical then.

03:59.055 --> 04:04.689
So many people have a habit of all the time
shouting mantras. It's not habit.

04:04.714 --> 04:08.654
Mantras should open your chakras,
otherwise, it has no meaning.

04:08.679 --> 04:13.171
They should be used properly at key points,

04:13.196 --> 04:19.093
with great respect, with a great
understanding, and then allow them

04:19.118 --> 04:23.548
to open your chakras, by which you take
the water in

04:23.573 --> 04:27.213
of that great thing known as Kundalini.

04:27.238 --> 04:31.417
The greatest blessing will come to you
through Her love.

04:31.442 --> 04:36.072
But not the way, people are just taking
there should be no transformation.

04:36.097 --> 04:39.173
If you are identified with your ego
and think oh, you are all right,

04:39.198 --> 04:41.931
you are sadly mistaken.

04:41.956 --> 04:45.296
You have to transform completely within
yourself.

04:45.321 --> 04:48.298
Some people if their circumstances
are changed,

04:48.323 --> 04:51.933
then they feel very well and they think
oh, they have achieved the highest.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.770
It is not so, is only the circumstance
that has changed,

04:55.795 --> 04:59.492
only the atmosphere that has changed
and that makes you feel

04:59.517 --> 05:02.846
that you have achieved something great.

05:02.871 --> 05:05.942
You have to achieve it wherever you are.

05:05.967 --> 05:09.621
It should be retained and must be there.
But by coming

05:09.646 --> 05:14.393
to a quieter place, you can pay more
attention, that's why you are here.

05:14.418 --> 05:17.297
But by coming here, if you just feel nice

05:17.322 --> 05:19.867
and think that oh, you have achieved
everything, then it's...

05:19.892 --> 05:23.795
you are sadly mistaken. You have to grow
in this atmosphere;

05:23.820 --> 05:29.206
you have come here to grow and to be
changed, to be different person altogether.

05:29.231 --> 05:32.684
Do not be identified with your ego and
do not get satisfied

05:32.709 --> 05:36.134
with something that you feel...
"feeling nice and good."

05:36.159 --> 05:38.245
That's not the way to look at things.

05:38.270 --> 05:42.944
You have to transform yourself and see
for yourself: How are you behaving?

05:42.969 --> 05:48.525
How are you feeling about things? Are you
taking a new view of things or not?

05:48.550 --> 05:53.686
Now, the worst thing that comes in the way
of ego is obstinacy,

05:53.711 --> 05:56.607
of your own obstinacy.

05:56.632 --> 06:01.473
Obstinate people are extremely difficult
and they find pride in their obstinacy

06:01.498 --> 06:06.083
and they'll go on saying that, "Yes,
I'm obstinate." What to do?

06:06.108 --> 06:08.886
If you take pride in all such nonsensical
things,

06:08.910 --> 06:12.044
then you carry the load of these stones
on your head

06:12.070 --> 06:16.106
- this life, next life and many lives
to come that you are going to live.

06:16.139 --> 06:18.557
All such stones must be dropped
immediately

06:18.582 --> 06:24.694
and should shake them off because
you have to achieve your beauty.

06:24.719 --> 06:30.892
You have seen how a flower shakes off
all that is not needed,

06:30.917 --> 06:34.215
blooms out, pierces its head outwards,

06:34.240 --> 06:37.198
opens out just to give fragrance to others.

06:37.223 --> 06:40.714
If you want to give fragrance to others,
how far fragrance within you?

06:40.739 --> 06:45.059
Is there fragrance within you that you
are going to give fragrance to others?

06:45.084 --> 06:49.200
So that is what one has to find out
and has to do it.

06:49.225 --> 06:52.507
First and foremost thing: How far
you can love others?

06:52.532 --> 06:55.795
How far you can fulfill your duties

06:55.820 --> 07:01.713
as a husband, wife, child, father,
mother - everything?

07:01.738 --> 07:04.510
It is not the way people understand
Sahaja Yoga

07:04.535 --> 07:09.402
- is that you hang in the air somewhere
and then you say that, “I am all right”.

07:09.427 --> 07:13.695
Of course, there are difficult people
and difficult relationships,

07:13.720 --> 07:19.783
but a sahaja yogi must have a very
detached view of the whole thing

07:19.808 --> 07:24.561
and should be able to correct all those
problems that exist

07:24.586 --> 07:29.432
and should take a very strong and stern
view of the people who are not

07:29.457 --> 07:33.866
Sahaja in their family and around and tell
them off that, “What are you doing?

07:33.891 --> 07:38.078
Are you going to carry on like this
all your lives and are going to die

07:38.103 --> 07:42.727
with this... all this load on your heads
or are you going to get rid of it?”.

07:42.752 --> 07:46.135
But first of all, you have to be all right.

07:46.160 --> 07:51.690
Now in our being, we have manas on the,
from the left-hand side

07:51.715 --> 07:55.007
it comes to the right hand and goes
backwards,

07:55.032 --> 07:59.967
and we have also got ahankara, which is
the ego,

07:59.992 --> 08:03.248
which goes - comes up on
the right-hand side...

08:03.273 --> 08:05.927
from the right-hand side to the left-hand
side

08:05.952 --> 08:10.246
and in the brain it comes forward,
on the left-hand side it moves.

08:10.271 --> 08:15.063
So with these two things, two - ego
and superego,

08:15.088 --> 08:18.136
manas and ahankara we have got

08:18.161 --> 08:22.498
- in between these two is the buddhi,
is the intelligence is in between.

08:22.523 --> 08:29.839
But this intelligence if it is not, if it
is not balanced by wisdom

08:29.864 --> 08:34.660
- by subuddhi - it can be very dangerous,

08:34.685 --> 08:40.705
and it records all that you are doing.
It knows what you are doing.

08:40.730 --> 08:44.372
But if you are identified with your ego
or superego,

08:44.397 --> 08:47.482
the buddhi cannot go too far.

08:47.507 --> 08:50.218
In the beginning, it may try to tell you
that, "This is wrong,

08:50.243 --> 08:52.512
you should not go there, you should not
do that,"

08:52.537 --> 08:54.714
but then it becomes silent.

08:54.739 --> 08:58.023
So you have to be very careful about
your intelligence also.

08:58.048 --> 09:01.762
Your intelligence becomes suddenly silent;
it doesn't help you.

09:01.787 --> 09:04.918
Then, the ego takes over or the superego
takes over.

09:04.943 --> 09:08.669
Then all your thinking, all your
understanding

09:08.694 --> 09:13.344
goes according to the...according to the
lines of ego, and you go ahead with it,

09:13.369 --> 09:18.124
and you just don't know where you are
going, what you are doing.

09:18.524 --> 09:23.647
So when we are in this place, we are...
decided to have a very good

09:23.672 --> 09:28.944
session of Sahaja Yoga, it is important
for all of us to know

09:28.969 --> 09:32.607
when we go from here, how much changed
are we going to be.

09:32.632 --> 09:37.039
Otherwise, there's a puja, there's a havan,
there's this... every time;

09:37.064 --> 09:41.036
and what is the progress within ourselves
- we should see.

09:41.061 --> 09:45.621
Is it as much as a little ant moves

09:45.646 --> 09:50.194
in one minute or is it something much more?

09:50.219 --> 09:53.986
The progress is slow because we do not
want to transform ourselves.

09:54.011 --> 09:57.552
Every moment try to see that you transform
yourself.

09:57.577 --> 10:02.189
I have seen people who have been
living like

10:02.214 --> 10:05.651
hippopotamus - have been living like
hippopotamus.

10:05.676 --> 10:13.243
Those who are living like hyenas
will remain like hyenas.

10:13.268 --> 10:18.304
They go on remaining with their own
identification,

10:18.329 --> 10:22.555
feeling very happy about it, which is
a very wrong thing.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.674
You have to bloom out, bloom out
like flowers.

10:26.699 --> 10:32.612
Change yourself, transform yourself!
This transformation is going to help you.

10:32.637 --> 10:37.879
This is like triggering into a new
dimension of life.

10:37.904 --> 10:42.721
Unless and until this triggering shows,
your life has no meaning,

10:42.746 --> 10:47.638
Sahaja Yoga has no meaning to you.
So try your level best

10:47.663 --> 10:53.129
to trigger this transformation - every
minute of your life -

10:53.154 --> 10:56.602
then you will be amazed at the enrichment
of life.

10:56.627 --> 10:59.949
Whatever I may try, just now I've cleared
you out quite a lot, I think.

10:59.974 --> 11:03.919
I have cleared you out up and down
- quite a lot, isn't it?

11:03.944 --> 11:07.799
But despite that, now it is for you
to keep it there.

11:07.824 --> 11:11.571
First of all, your attention, I don't
think, is that all right.

11:11.596 --> 11:15.494
That's why you catch on the right Nabhi
and on the liver.

11:15.519 --> 11:19.502
Attention has to be on one side, but if you
go on moving your head,

11:19.527 --> 11:22.865
moving your attention, then you cannot be
on Nirvichara.

11:22.890 --> 11:28.185
So to keep on Nirvichara, you have to keep
your attention first steady,

11:28.210 --> 11:30.803
and once this steadiness is achieved,

11:30.828 --> 11:36.098
then you just have to see that you are
Nirvichara.

11:36.123 --> 11:39.646
Put all your thoughts in that stream
of Nirvichara

11:39.671 --> 11:42.206
and it will solve your problem.

11:42.231 --> 11:45.576
But transformation is definitely
a positive stage

11:45.601 --> 11:48.626
where you see yourself. You see, you see
yourself; you call yourself,

11:48.651 --> 11:51.593
say, you call yourself Nirmala. Then
you say,

11:51.618 --> 11:55.945
"Oh, Nirmala, now, is this the way
to look at things?"

11:55.970 --> 12:01.953
Transformation is identifying yourself
with that Self which sees you.

12:01.978 --> 12:05.960
So that, once you start identifying
with that Self

12:05.985 --> 12:10.258
and expressing something to this self,
which is Nirmala,

12:10.283 --> 12:13.856
then you are separated; then
the transformation takes place.

12:13.881 --> 12:18.522
Because first, you should see and then
you should be identified with that self,

12:18.547 --> 12:20.763
so there's a transformation within
yourself.

12:20.788 --> 12:25.212
Otherwise, only you'll be carrying some
energy within you,

12:25.237 --> 12:28.858
by which you may do little miracles
- you may raise Kundalinis.

12:28.883 --> 12:34.817
But what about you? You will be where
you were.

12:34.842 --> 12:38.169
So it is important when we come to a place
like that,

12:38.194 --> 12:43.596
that we must not be carried away
by something very outward

12:43.628 --> 12:48.295
and absolutely of no value to Sahaja Yoga.

12:48.663 --> 12:54.269
Now in the later day, I will tell you
how to raise your

12:54.294 --> 12:59.352
different powers, but just now, I think,
we must decide,

12:59.377 --> 13:03.452
we'll go from here absolutely transformed
into new persons.

13:03.477 --> 13:06.444
May God bless you.
