19850705 Shri Trigunatmika

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.160
Are, you can open the window a little bit, I think.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.999
It will be better. One window will do.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.999
They are all closed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.999
One window you can.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.320
They are opened as much as they will, Shri Mataji.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.920
Really? That's all that can be opened?

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.480
They have all arrived, so we'll wait for two minutes for them.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.280
Tell them to come from the other side.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.320
Can somebody go and tell?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.480
When you are taking photographs I'll not have this.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.000
Better, then I'll have it later.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.320
You must take the right angle and right time.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480
I find, some people take exactly the wrong angle and the wrong time.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.999
Yes, where you get the vibrations, that’s the point you must click.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.960
That's it.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.280
And because you just take it at a wrong time,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.400
photographs do not come out well for some people.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.999
Vibrations will tell you when to take.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.240
I took photographs of some people

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.240
and their vibrations stated flowing.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.840
It’s all related.

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.480
Come along, we've been waiting for you!

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.160
[unclear] has not come?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.480
That's o.k. Shri Mother. Actually we left her

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.480
or otherwise we would have been too late.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.840
Oh, God !

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.480
But she will do a little Puja at home by herself, she said.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.240
S.M. - But where is she?
Y - At home.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.440
And I had to go to fetch Warren in Gent and

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.320
I learned the Puja was earlier...

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.999
Why didn't you take with you? Take her...

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.280
Poor thing, she'll feel very bad.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.480
We came straight away, to be here faster.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.240
Now the people from Brussels and from Gent

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.999
and from Holland should come forward.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.480
Can you move this side a little?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.160
So she can sit there.

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:14.840
They are so beautiful Shri Mataji in these saris.

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.280
Looking very beautifully.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.999
This is the sari you had in Venice, Shri Mataji.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.999
I gave them to ware as a present but I am left

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.280
with no sari to give them. So i don't know what to do...

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.440
Well I have only white saris left,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.999
so I thought I'll send them some nice saris.

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.400
All right.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.480
You want to take, take photograph now.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.840
You see, the thing is, in between you should not.

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:58.480
Just a minute she is taking.

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.840
You must take the photograph at a particular time, you see?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.999
Now, say supposing I am talking, that time you should not.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.400
Or I am treating somebody, then you should not.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.999
So we are in Holland,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.920
which is the holy land of Europe.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.280
And the holy land of Europe

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.840
has got lots of water in it, flowing.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.480
It's at a lower level than the Mother Earth

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.999
and the sea flows through it.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.320
So it's a good combination of the sea and the earth here.

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:20.480
So sea cleanses

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:27.999
and the Mother Earth blesses the people of Holland,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.000
But if they have lost their moorings

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.840
and they are flying in the wrong direction,

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:45.440
then the same holy land can become a hell land.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.999
So we have to be very careful

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.480
to see that we create more and more Sahaja Yogis in this place.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:02.400
In My reading of the character of the western people

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.320
I find they are extremely aggressive by nature

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.999
and very egoistical on the whole.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.240
One should not feel that I am saying about you, but I'm saying.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.000
You are Sahaja yogis, you belong to the Kingdom of God

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.999
but I'm telling about in general now.

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:25.840
While I'm talking keep your eyes open.

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:30.480
I don't know why people close the eyes, this I can't understand.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.200
Now when we are in the holy land,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.999
we find that the Mother Earth has allowed the sea to flow in,

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:52.200
and is a very good place for Me to say something to you.

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:59.320
Here the sea has taken refuge in the Mother.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:06.480
The guru has bound itself with the motherly qualities.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.480
A person feels more safe on the ground

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:15.999
than on the sea or in the air.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.480
So today is the best opportunity for Me to say

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:24.320
that after the Guru Puja,

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:28.999
we have to understand that to be holy means

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.240
you must allow

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.840
the guru tattwa to circulate

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:39.200
in the Mother principle.

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:45.480
Or the guru tattwa is to be controlled and guided and beautified

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:49.999
by the Mother principle.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.960
It's only the Mother Earth that is beautiful

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.999
because it can create so many varieties,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.480
so many dramas, so many places.

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:04.999
Any other element, if you see, has nothing in it.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.320
So it is She who can create.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.360
So we should take to the motherly quality more

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:18.999
and try to bind our guru principle

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.400
through that Motherly, beautiful, creative power,

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:31.440
so that we make our presence very agreeable,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.840
very congenial, very beautiful,

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:40.000
full of interest and varieties;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.840
every time new flowers, every time new fruits,

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:48.480
every time a new, new design.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
As Kundalini is made of Mother Earth,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.240
we are quite capable of doing that.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.320
There are gurus and gurus and gurus but no one so far

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.480
is such a master as you are of the Kundalini.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.240
If they were they would have given Realization to thousands.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:17.999
Why? Because your Mother has penetrated into your guru principle.

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:22.840
And has risen your Kundalini,

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:24.999
has given you powers to raise Kundalini,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.999
breaking your seventh chakra, so clearly.

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:32.480
That never happened with anyone.

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:37.999
Even incarnations could not do that to the masses, as you are doing.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.999
Kundalini is flowing from your hand;

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.440
the Ganesha is active in you,

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:49.840
but it should never give you the ego,

00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:56.240
or the sternness or the heaviness of the sea.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.999
But it should give you the beauty of the Mother Earth.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.999
Mother Earth is always bigger than the sea,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.840
because She has to contain the sea.

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:13.480
Sea can never be bigger than the Mother Earth.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.840
Sometimes it looks, sea, bigger

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:19.240
but sea is contained in the Mother Earth.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.960
It cannot go beyond.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.999
So Mother Earth is always greater, bigger, wider than the sea.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.999
So one has to understand that when Kundalini has risen,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.200
you have become all of the seven chakras

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.999
and not only the guru chakra.

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:41.840
And when you have become the guru chakra

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:47.320
it is also bounded on all sides by the Mother Earth.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.999
Under these circumstances,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.480
when we are so capable,

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.480
we are giving Realization to so many people,

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:00.840
when we are achieving so many things,

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:07.480
if we could just become humble, congenial, beautiful,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.480
we can master the whole world.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:16.440
But I find in the styles of Sahaja yogis, especially in the west,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.000
and westernized Indians,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.999
there is so much of ego still expressed

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.999
in their talks, in their behavior.

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:30.480
They are not capable of it, to see I think sometimes,

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:33.999
but better see it.

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:38.999
First you may have to act as sweet people, maybe,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.920
but you must learn that way.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.320
If you do not understand that all your leadership,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.440
all your guru tattwa depends entirely

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.480
on the loving capacity of your Mother, Her patience.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.999
I get angry but perhaps once in a ten years or twelve years,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.000
something like that, seldom.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.320
That's better, then the anger has some meaning.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.840
But all the time if you are in a temper or you try to show off

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:15.840
or if you have so much of ego

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:18.840
that you go on asserting on wrong things,

00:14:18.999 --> 00:14:21.240
then you cannot be effective.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.240
Another thing I've seen, that ego has no discretion.

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:30.840
Ego has no discretion of any kind.

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:34.999
If you are egoistical, first thing you lose is discretion.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.200
Then what's the use of having this nonsense of a ego?

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.960
which doesn't give you discretion?

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.999
And people who have greater ego always then assert

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.000
and you have to agree to that.

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:51.320
You are more impressed by the people

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.999
who have greater ego than yours.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.840
And you like the people who are without any ego

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:02.480
so you can oppress on them.

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:05.840
But the discretion part is very poor, that you can see.

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:09.320
The other day one guru had come, the one gentleman had come,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.920
and he has given some mantra by his guru.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.840
Now, he can't hear anything against his guru.  Why?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.480
Because his ego has chosen that guru.

00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:23.320
Because the ego has chosen how can the ego be wrong?

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.999
And ego is always wrong, invariably it is wrong.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.999
Everything is upside down with the ego-orientation.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.280
Gradually you will learn that in the west

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.000
people lack common sense,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.320
completely they lack common sense, in everything.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.999
I mean if they had common sense

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.000
there would have been much less problems.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.840
But common sense is lacking

00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:52.840
and also I find the same thing in Sahaja yogis.

00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:54.840
They lack common sense.

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:59.840
You have to become so wise, that common sense should be your nature.

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:02.200
But common sense we lack.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.840
Like today, (I`ll have some water)

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:11.999
today I was discussing about say, the labor problem,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.960
which is a very general problem,

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:26.120
which is a very general problem.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.240
You have a labor problem.  For example you have unemployment.

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:33.480
Now the whole system that is built in here

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.280
and we too have adopted some of it but not to that extent,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.999
of working hours, is very absurd.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.440
For example, supposing you get up at four o'clock.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.999
I mean that's very big supposition, of course, but

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.999
supposing we get up at four and we take our bath.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.000
Morning time is very peaceful, we can meditate,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.480
we can do what we like.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.200
Then we finish all the other work we have to do,

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.320
get yourself ready, have yourself ready,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.320
have your breakfast or tea or whatever you want to have.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.840
Then by eight o'clock you are ready for work.

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:18.400
Supposing you go at eight o'clock for your work.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:27.400
So you can work from eight up to one o'clock very easily,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.999
very easily, no problem.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.320
Then one o'clock you come back home,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.999
have your lunch and have a siesta.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.480
If you can have siesta for about two hours,

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:50.400
say three, till four o'clock , by five o'clock you again go to work.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.280
Then you can work from five to eleven without feeling tired at all.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.480
After eleven you might be.

00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:00.999
So you put in much more work,

00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:07.280
much less sleep and you keep fresh and young.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.999
But it is, it requires common sense.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.000
Now the, how unemployment can be solved;

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.920
some people can work in the morning, some can work in the evening.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.320
Now those who are working in the morning,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.480
the ladies could be in the house, men could be outside.

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:29.320
Then the men come out in the evening,

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.999
they can do the household work.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.440
Ladies can do in their house

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:39.360
or when they are in the house, men can do creative work,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.999
like making statutes, hand work,

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:46.440
hand-made things.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.200
So everybody gets employment.

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:55.999
They became more creative,  much happier people

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.999
and so easy to solve the problem.

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:04.840
But there is unemployment;

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:07.480
Because of unemployment there are so many problems.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.840
Very easy to solve the problem of unemployment.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.840
You don't give any social security or anything.

00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:18.999
You give them their pay and let them work for shorter time.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.840
If you make them create things and sell them,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.480
they have more money

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.999
or they can have nice things around them.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.999
Otherwise you can have horrid things like that.

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:42.200
So you can have lots of things which are hand-made,

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:45.080
plus machine-made things, whatever you want to have.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.320
There should be a balance. With common sense we should know

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.480
how far to go, how far to have balance.

00:19:52.999 --> 00:19:56.480
Like machine goes on like mad; we cannot control machines.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.840
Because we think we get money, we do not.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.200
After some time machines have to stop.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.480
So you have to go up to...

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:14.240
This, I'm trying to put the guru tattwa into the Mother tattwa,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.480
as practical.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.120
So common sense should be applied

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.480
and that can only come when there is no ego.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.000
With ego that cannot be common sense

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.400
"Because I like it, I do it".  But this "I" is a ego who is blind,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.480
who is indiscreet, who is stupid.

00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:50.999
So ultimately we do stupid things.

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:55.320
There should be common sense,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.000
which one can learn by getting rid of this ego.

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:06.999
Now people say, "Mother, how to get rid of ego?"

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.840
It's very simple, you have to move left to the right 108 times,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.240
in Sahaja yoga.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.440
You have to forgive people, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:21.840
And you can watch yourself.  First of all, see,

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:25.400
do you watch others or you watch yourself?  First of all.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.200
Like there was a lady traveling with Me, very old lady.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.840
And she said, "This man is handsome.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.480
This man is not handsome.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.480
This woman is good looking, she is pretty", that way.

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:47.480
I was looking at her.  I said "This mad woman,

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:50.960
she will go really crazy by the time we get down.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.240
She goes on looking into every person, judging everyone,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.200
who is handsome, who is not."

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.000
And everybody whom she called handsome I found him ugly.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.480
So I gave up. I said "You better decide I never tried these things".

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.840
Then, "That man is not good, he is very hot tempered,

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:14.320
he is this thing, he is that,

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.999
he talks like that, he walks like that,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.280
he shouldn't do, look like that",

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.000
worried about other people.

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:26.240
You tell them anything, they'll go on shaking their neck like that,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.240
"Oh, how could you do it?"  But you do it yourselves.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.999
If they have to say yes, they'll do it ten times, "yes, yes, yes".

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.999
If they have to say no, they'll go on saying: "no, no, no, no, no".

00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:46.999
There is no common sense.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.840
Why to move your neck so many times.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
See if somebody is saying that, you need not react all the time.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.240
So this is another thing, is internal reaction.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.840
First is external, seeing everyone, judging everyone,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.320
"Oh, I don't like this station; this is too much dusty".

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.320
"This bathroom is not good, that room is not good,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.160
that thing is not good", like that go on,

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:18.000
as if you are the Queen of England.

00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:21.999
Even that could be even more than that

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.320
because she is not even allowed to choose her dress;

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.999
Parliament has to decide.

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:37.960
Poor thing cannot have any ego at all, poor thing.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320
She has to choose what dress she has to wear

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.480
for a particular occasion;

00:23:42.999 --> 00:23:47.480
If the Parliament says yes, she wears.  She says no, no.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.840
big problem, for them.

00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:57.320
But for us, who are free people, we must have common sense

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.840
to understand what to do, where to do, what to talk, how to talk.

00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:04.999
But when there is ego, you cannot have common sense.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.200
And this is the reason I think

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.440
the western people have become so stupid in so many things.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.240
Whatever I see, I see it's upside down.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.320
Indians, we may be poor people, in the villages.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.840
They are not so educated. You are all very well educated people,

00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:25.999
everything is there, but all has come out of ego.

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:29.999
So the common sense is lacking.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.320
So those who deal with the Mother Earth, like farmers are,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.400
have tremendous common sense.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.320
Now in Holland I used to think people will have

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.480
lot of common sense, because they are farmers you see.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.960
When I had come in '65, they were better off, much better people,

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.400
not so nonsensical.

00:24:52.999 --> 00:24:57.240
They were well dressed, nice, sensible, solid people.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.999
Of course I met quite elderly people also, I should say,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.320
but I was surprised that in the market

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.999
you could not get a transistor made in Holland ,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.999
could not get anything made in Holland.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.320
So I said, "How is it? You don't make anything, machines?"

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.000
They said, "Why should we? For our twenty-five bulbs of tulips,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.840
- in those days - we get one transistor from Japan.

00:25:20.999 --> 00:25:24.999
So why should we make a transistor?"  Common sense.

00:25:25.999 --> 00:25:28.240
"We send from here twenty five bulbs".

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.960
And they had fields and fields of all kinds of tulips,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.840
all over, I mean when I came here. So they said,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.320
"For twenty-five bulbs we get one transistor so why should we?

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.999
We export our bulbs to them and get their transistors.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.999
Why should we make transistors?"

00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:53.000
Then they said "We export our cheese to a particular country,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.320
our eggs to Italy , our chicken to this country

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.999
and we get all that we need."

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.840
I was amazed you see. They are so, so proud of their agriculture

00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:07.840
and so much doing that way,

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:10.240
which was a very sensible thing and because

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.999
they were dealing with the land I thought I'll find

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.960
Holland people to be the best.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.320
But then I got reports that people are

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.000
absolutely gone off their heads.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.999
They have become like bullocks now

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.120
Working with the land they have become

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.999
like bullocks who plough the land.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.999
I was surprised "How have they become like bulls?"

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:43.400
They were very sensible people, very sensible.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.999
Farmers, sensibly dealing with things

00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:52.480
and working out things

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.999
in such a beautiful manner,

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.960
very innocent and simple people and naive,

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.320
up to a point of sweetness, very sweet.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.320
When we came here they wanted to please us,

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.480
so they wanted to put a flag for us or for our country.

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:15.999
And they put Pakistan's flag in front of us.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:28.840
So I was very happy to see that.

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:31.280
And they were talking of vegetarianism.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.280
But when we came, my daughter had suddenly become vegetarian

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.320
because she had developed a funny nausea

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.960
in the, in the ship, you see.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.000
So she was not eating any meat or like that.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.840
So she said "We are, I am vegetarian".

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.999
So they said, "All right, then will you have chicken?"

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.999
They were that simple you know, very simple people.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.840
And now they are talking about vegetarianism.

00:27:54.999 --> 00:27:58.280
I am surprised. Since '65 and '85 only,

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.480
these twenty years, how much they are changed.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.960
Very nice. And they were not busy doing all these exercises,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.840
and reducing weight or increasing weight and jogging on the road.

00:28:12.999 --> 00:28:16.840
Just now, yesterday, I was walking, everybody was jogging like mad.

00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:22.999
Very sensible, but they have lost their common sense.

00:28:23.999 --> 00:28:26.840
Because perhaps they do not come in contact with Mother Earth,

00:28:26.999 --> 00:28:30.960
they are using machines too much, maybe that is one of the reasons.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.240
And must be the air from other outside countries coming

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.999
and they think "They are rustic", so they must accept

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.480
that is all that is modern, sophisticated, perhaps, maybe.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.999
There is a story about a farmer, who was traveling by train.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.320
And there were some naughty boys who came from the city

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.999
so they wanted to pull the legs of the farmer.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.840
So one of the boys asked him that "If the eggs

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.440
are selling here

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.480
in this station for 20 p

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:14.960
and in the next station the chicken is selling for one pound,

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.320
what is my age?"

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.960
Just to tease him.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.480
So immediately the fellow says "You must be twenty-two".

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.320
He said "How do you know exactly if I am twenty-two?"

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.200
He said "Because my brother who is full mad, is forty-four."

00:29:47.999 --> 00:29:51.840
Can you see? They are so practical, so "brass".

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:54.840
You see, as you call in American language "brass tacks", you see.

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:59.480
They know what is it. He looked at him and he said, "Twenty-two".

00:29:59.999 --> 00:30:06.240
He said, "How? Why?" "My brother, who is 44, is full mad".

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.999
And these boys didn't know where to look, you see,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.999
because they wanted to tease him.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.999
And the farmers have great sense.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.480
Like we had one minister who had developed a bad neck, you see,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.240
wild Vishuddhi. He was Chief Minister.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.960
He used to go on like this, his head used to go like this.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.840
So some farmers came to see him.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.240
They saw him and they looked at him.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.840
They said, "Oh, he's saying no already,

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:42.240
what's the use of telling him anything?"

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.480
We have lots of stories of farmers in India,

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:48.999
which shows how much they understand life.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.840
I had a very nice gardener.

00:30:51.999 --> 00:30:53.840
He was from a village.

00:30:53.999 --> 00:30:58.280
So there was one fellow, old fellow,

00:30:58.999 --> 00:31:00.840
another gardener.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.480
He says, "No use talking to this old fellow". I said, "Why?"

00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:08.160
He said "If he is a Hindu,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.920
then an old man is a gone case."
I said "Why?"

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.920
"Because in young age they live like

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.480
ascetics and in old age they become like bhoots.

00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:21.840
But if he is a Muslim, they don't live like ascetics in young age.

00:31:21.999 --> 00:31:24.840
They enjoy life and in old age they are satisfied souls.

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:29.480
So you better talk to a Muslim old man than to a Hindu old man."

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.200
I mean their reading is so correct about things, you know.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:41.200
Everything that he said was so practical and so sensible.

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:44.999
I was really surprised how he could say these things

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.120
with such sweetness and with such goodness

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.999
and how he understood so many things so well.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.840
And he was a very young fellow;

00:31:55.999 --> 00:31:58.999
about I would say thirty, thirty-two years of age.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.999
So he came to, he came to Bombay to see us.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.360
He didn't know our full address, he only knew Marine Drive.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.840
So he told the fellow, his taxi fellow,

00:32:10.999 --> 00:32:12.840
"You drive me at Marine Drive ".

00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:14.320
He said "Marine Drive is a big place".

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.840
He said, "Drive me anywhere in Marine Drive "; he drove.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.840
So he went and asked "Is there a very tall

00:32:19.999 --> 00:32:22.840
gentleman staying in Marine Drive somewhere?"

00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:26.840
And you see, my husband is one of the tallest in Indians, you see.

00:32:26.999 --> 00:32:28.840
So he went to the servants, asked

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:30.840
"Have you seen any tall sahib anywhere?"

00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:33.120
He said "There's one tallest staying there, you see".

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.840
So that's how he came to our house.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.840
And he showed them his shoes, "These shoes

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:39.480
given to me by my sahib. He is also very tall, you see".

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.840
So he said "This shoe, he has given me,

00:32:41.999 --> 00:32:43.999
and he wears the same style of shoes".

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.280
So servants noticed all these things and they were practical people.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.480
So another gardener who met him, he said

00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:52.920
"Yes, there's a tall fellow and he wears the same type of shoes".

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.000
So he came to our house.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.840
How they are sharp and how their eyes are so penetrating,

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:04.920
how they know everything about everything.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.840
It is remarkable,

00:33:07.999 --> 00:33:11.480
very remarkable and that is what we have to be.

00:33:11.999 --> 00:33:17.400
We have to be gurus with the Mother's influence on us.

00:33:17.999 --> 00:33:20.840
All the time the Mother controlling us, the Mother guiding us,

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.840
the Mother making our banks, Mother making our maryadas.

00:33:23.999 --> 00:33:26.480
So the motherliness is your blessing.

00:33:26.999 --> 00:33:29.999
Today you are raising your Kundalini because your guru is a Mother.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.480
Otherwise you could never have done it.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.280
And that is why motherliness is so important.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.360
One of the reasons, perhaps, why the Sahaja yogis run away

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.840
from the leaders and sometimes from the people

00:33:46.999 --> 00:33:50.840
who want to have follow-on may be that we do not know

00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:54.360
that they are just entering in, just opening out.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.999
So try to be kind, just hatching

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.960
The little chicks, you see, will die very fast.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.320
You have to handle them very, very carefully.

00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:09.400
I am saying this after so many years of not saying this,

00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:13.400
and I am requesting all of you, try to develop.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.320
Sit before the mirror and try to act like a Mother.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:23.920
Let us see, practice it, try to be nice, kindly, gentle, patient.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.200
If you want to spread Sahaja Yoga in the west,

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.000
we have to do that way. Not in Maharashtra,

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.320
Maharashtra 's mothers are quite strict

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.840
and they are straightforward, and children are used to it.

00:34:36.999 --> 00:34:39.840
You might find that our, you will say that My,

00:34:39.999 --> 00:34:42.999
My Mother was a very strict lady but I think I like her very much

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.999
because she's taught me so many things.

00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:50.120
Other my sisters are expert cooks, we are very good in the life,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.240
we are doing so well in life, we don't trouble anyone".

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.480
All these things have come from our mother,

00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:57.200
because She was a strict lady

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.840
as she would not tolerate any nonsense.

00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:02.120
She would never tell a lie herself and if you tell her

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.320
"All right, if this gentleman is coming,

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.480
you tell that I am not in the house", "Don't tell me to tell lies.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.000
I'll tell him that you told me to tell the lies".

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.840
That's how she was

00:35:13.999 --> 00:35:15.999
and that's how she treated us.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.840
And we lived with that but we didn't mind it

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.840
because what she did was for our good.

00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:24.999
We knew that she was doing it for our good.  Not in this country;

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.840
people don't understand this fact.  They have ego.

00:35:27.999 --> 00:35:30.320
They never understand that this is for your good.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.840
They will always understand this is aggressiveness

00:35:32.999 --> 00:35:35.999
because they themselves are aggressed or they are aggressive.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.440
If they are aggressed, they are even worse.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.400
So try to understand what is the situation is in this country.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.440
I have adjusted Myself; you also should adjust yourself here,

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:49.999
to the way it is. And that's how I should not hear

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.440
any more any complaints about.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.960
Now, again the guru tattwa has to go inside, the mother tattwa.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.440
So next time I will not have any complaints

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.400
but they should all say "Oh, Mother, what a nice man,

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.440
he's so kind, he's so gentle, he's so very sweet".

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.999
It doesn't take at all, anything, to be that.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.999
Now in this good atmosphere when the nature is so abundant

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.000
and the sun also is hiding its own sharpness,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.840
where everything is so beautiful,

00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:35.240
we should decide that we will behave in a manner

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.960
that will behoove our Mother.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.000
and not fight, not quarrel, not say things.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.999
Like somebody in the train now, supposing going,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.320
will go and quarrel with the ticket collector?

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.480
"This is my seat, that is mine". A Sahaja Yogi does not do that.

00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:56.200
A Sahaj Yogi, "All right you don't want? All right, I'll sit here.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.999
All right, whatever is legal I'll do that, whatever is proper I do.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.480
You want it? All right, doesn't matter. You don't allow? All right".

00:37:02.999 --> 00:37:05.999
Immediately the person melts away.

00:37:06.999 --> 00:37:10.999
But if you, "No, this is my seat.  I've booked it, this, that".

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.320
And then your Mother plays tricks there, on top of that.

00:37:16.999 --> 00:37:20.400
So ultimately you find that the seat was not yours.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.320
And you, you feel very upset about it,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.999
"how a Sahaja yogi is insulted"?

00:37:43.999 --> 00:37:46.999
So that is how it is going to work out

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.080
in this beautiful manner

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.320
if we understand the beauty of sweetness

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.840
and beauty of your Mother Earth,

00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:02.920
how She beautifully creates everything.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.999
And even She is so sweet, I tell you

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.999
that if you are sleeping under a coconut tree, can you imagine now?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.999
A coconut is so big, if it falls on anybody's head, finished;

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.320
stomach, also, terrible.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.120
It can break your bone. But it will never fall

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.200
on any human being or any animal. Can you believe it?

00:38:27.999 --> 00:38:30.840
It's a fact. That is the  ritambhara pragya.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.320
That's the quality of the Mother Earth.

00:38:33.999 --> 00:38:38.999
It never falls on any human being or animal.

00:38:41.999 --> 00:38:43.920
How does She manage that?

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.999
And you have seen how the flowers also form gentle.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.240
You never see the flowers growing,

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.240
How the Mother does that? Otherwise we'll have problems, you see.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.480
Suddenly, you see a flower....

00:39:00.999 --> 00:39:06.240
So She, slowly She does it and suddenly you find oh!

00:39:07.999 --> 00:39:10.840
She makes the leaves so beautifully arranged

00:39:10.999 --> 00:39:14.999
that they all get the sun.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.960
How She manages?

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.840
Then She creates a beautiful shade for you,

00:39:22.999 --> 00:39:26.320
the color scheme, everything so beautiful.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.440
And then how She nourishes that

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.999
because all the leaves drop down

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.840
and they give nitrogen again to the Mother Earth

00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:38.480
and then She again nourishes them up and they will...

00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:40.280
But the leaves have to fall down

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.999
if the Sun has to come to the Mother Earth.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.840
It is all Her doing but She does it so beautifully

00:39:47.999 --> 00:39:51.440
that we are not even aware of what She is doing to us.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.840
We don't know.  If you notice it, the one thing

00:39:55.999 --> 00:39:59.960
about the Mother Earth's beauty that She creates

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.480
and how sweetly She does it,

00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:07.999
you will say that even one billionth of that, if we have,

00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:14.480
we could be somewhere, already, ruling,

00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:19.280
in the Kingdom of heaven, this is what it is.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.920
So as you have got your Kundalini,

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.999
you must develop that sweetness in you,

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.480
in such a manner that people see you and think

00:40:32.999 --> 00:40:35.999
that you are great mothers.

00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:41.000
But as you know in the west the mothers are so horrible,

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.840
the women are so dominating,

00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:49.999
that people do not have a proper image of a mother also.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.480
Women are extremely dominating.

00:40:52.999 --> 00:40:55.840
Women must learn to dominate, it's so easy.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.999
A bull can dominate anybody, but can they be like Mother Earth,

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.840
which can bear up all kinds of troubles,

00:41:06.999 --> 00:41:10.480
all kinds of problems.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.480
Can we do that way?

00:41:16.999 --> 00:41:20.320
Especially that's why I request women of this country

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.320
to develop those beautiful qualities and not of domination.

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:27.840
Domination, it doesn't behove a woman,

00:41:27.999 --> 00:41:30.480
it doesn't look nice on her.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.320
It's like a bull, she is wearing as a

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.240
diamond piece around her neck.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.240
It's not beautifying.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.999
So we must give up that idea of dominating

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.840
or trying to oppress the husband.

00:41:46.999 --> 00:41:50.999
He says something, we'll say "no", to children we say "no",

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.960
to everyone we try to dominate.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.080
That's not our character.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.320
Even, I think Roosevelt once said that -

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.360
of course he must have met real Indian women -

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:10.840
that an Indian woman, she is like a magnolia in an Indian forest.

00:42:10.999 --> 00:42:14.440
Of course, here the magnolias are useless but in Indian forest,

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.960
even one flower in the forest,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.480
it is hidden, you can't see it.

00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:25.999
But you can smell it. The whole forest is fragrant.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.400
you can't see it anywhere, it's hidden, a one flower,

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.999
you can know there is magnolia.

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:36.480
And this is the greatest quality

00:42:36.999 --> 00:42:40.400
because love is the most attractive thing in the world.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.999
Why do you hang around Me?

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.200
Just ask yourself.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.480
Because I have vibrations, My photograph has got.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.999
No. You feel that you are loved, that I love you.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.999
It's a very great quality but I have that innate within Me,

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.480
I don't have to have it from anywhere.

00:43:10.999 --> 00:43:14.960
And you too have it.  Just expose it and manifest it.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.120
May God bless you.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.480
So today we should do actually the Puja of the Bhoomi,

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.840
would be a better idea.  We'll do the Ganesha's Puja

00:43:29.999 --> 00:43:31.840
and then you worship Me as the Mother Earth,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.480
as the ritambhara pragya, which we have not done so far

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.480
in the holy land. All right?

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.440
And we have to thank all these Sahaja yogis

00:43:44.999 --> 00:43:47.840
who are so few here, who have arranged all this

00:43:47.999 --> 00:43:50.480
and have done such good work.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.320
We are thanking you, we are thanking Patricia,

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.840
and we are thanking these girls, Dominique,

00:44:12.999 --> 00:44:16.440
and we are thanking these two and we are thanking this gentleman.

00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:19.999
We are thanking you people. All right?

00:44:30.999 --> 00:44:33.840
And also Natalie, who is not here.

00:44:33.999 --> 00:44:35.999
She is a very solid Sahaja Yogini.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.999
I hope she will choose her fiancé also with that understanding.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.480
And Robert is here who is another Sahaja Yogi,

00:44:44.999 --> 00:44:49.840
who has done, I mean who is the one who brought me here.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.480
Now, of course, she has some problems, he had some problems,

00:44:53.999 --> 00:44:55.840
which are to be cured, which can be cured,

00:44:55.999 --> 00:44:58.840
and everything can be done very well.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.080
All of you have to work hard because if you people have problems,

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.999
other people won't accept it.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.080
So try to be aware of yourself, that's all.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.840
Otherwise everything is fine. May God bless you very much.

00:45:13.999 --> 00:45:18.000
You have more and more Sahaja Yogis, and you enjoy their company,

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.840
live with harmony, do not fight with each other.

00:45:20.999 --> 00:45:23.840
If you have to fight, fight with non Sahaja Yogis

00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:26.999
but not with Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.200
Now,

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:42.999
so, first thing should be to wash My Feet, which they can wash.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.160
Somebody should read and somebody should do [jadab].

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.080
Now, you can come and help them.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.480
And now you can start reading the Ganesha tattwa, this thing.

00:45:55.999 --> 00:46:02.080
I would like to know what things you have got for your Puja

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.080
because I would like to give you the things you don't have.

00:46:07.999 --> 00:46:10.040
All right.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.200
Y: Let's take the mantra of Shri Ganesha.
S.M.: Yes.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.840
Two, two of you should come. Come along, you come.

00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:30.999
Two, two each, yes.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.040
Wash it.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.440
Here.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.840
Let our ears hear that which is truth.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Let our eyes see that which is pure.

00:51:49.999 --> 00:51:52.280
Let our beings praise that which is divine,

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.240
and let those who listen hear not my voice

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.400
but the wisdom of God.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.840
Let us worship with the same song, the same strength

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.040
and the same knowledge.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.920
And let our meditation enlighten and enrich.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.999
Let there be among us compassion and peace.

00:52:18.999 --> 00:52:21.160
And now the prayer.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.160
Salutation Shri Ganesha, sakshat Shri Jesus.

00:52:25.999 --> 00:52:29.480
Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.

00:52:30.999 --> 00:52:34.920
It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.480
It is You who is the doer of all deeds that have been done,

00:52:38.999 --> 00:52:41.480
are being done and will be done.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.999
It is You who supports all things that are supported.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.240
It is You who protects all things that are protected.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.840
It is You who is the complete, all-pervading Spirit,

00:52:54.999 --> 00:52:57.960
God's divine energy.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.999
Think clearly brain; speak only the truth.

00:53:02.999 --> 00:53:05.999
Let Your presence in us speak.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.200
Let Your presence in us listen.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.880
Let Your presence in us bless.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.999
Let Your presence in us protect.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.240
Let Your presence in us, Your disciple, be the disciple.

00:53:20.999 --> 00:53:22.960
You are all the literature

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.400
and You are the ability to understand the literature.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.480
You are the divine combination of complete truth,

00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:34.400
complete happiness and complete energy. And You are more.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.080
You are all the knowledge

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.999
and You are the use to which the knowledge is put.

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.080
You exist until the end of all things,

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:46.999
and after the end of all things You are.

00:53:47.999 --> 00:53:49.960
You create the end of all things,

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:54.240
and after the end of all things You remain indifferent.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.400
You are the earth and You are the water.

00:53:58.999 --> 00:54:01.160
You are the fire and You are the air,

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.000
and You are the space above the air.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.840
You are the gunas and You are beyond the gunas.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.840
You are the body and You are beyond the body.

00:54:10.999 --> 00:54:14.040
You are the essence of time and You are beyond time.

00:54:14.999 --> 00:54:18.999
You and only You exist at the Mooladhara chakra.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.120
You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.999
All those who would join God meditate upon You.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.400
You are Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra; You are Indra, Agni, Vayu.

00:54:32.999 --> 00:54:36.000
You are the sun at noon, You are the full moon

00:54:36.999 --> 00:54:38.840
through all these and more and more.

00:54:38.999 --> 00:54:42.999
You are the all-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.999
You are the divine servant who stops to wash the feet of saints.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.480
You are the tiny core of all things without which

00:54:54.999 --> 00:54:57.000
the larger have no purpose.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.880
You are the key to the libraries of all the Scriptures,

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.999
without which the truth is hidden.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:08.040
You are the full stop which completes the sentence

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:12.000
and without which the sentence loses its meanings.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.000
You are the crescent moon, You are the stars,

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.240
and You are beyond the stars.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.080
All things from tiny dot to universe it's You.

00:55:24.999 --> 00:55:29.999
You are in the future and beyond the future. You are in all forms.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.999
You are where the sounds combine.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.160
You are the silence between the sounds.

00:55:37.999 --> 00:55:41.999
You are the rhythm of all music and all prayers.

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.840
This is the knowledge of Nirmal Ganesh.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.920
And You Nirmal Ganesh are the master of that knowledge

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.840
and all the knowledge.

00:55:52.999 --> 00:55:55.999
You are the God and You are the Goddess.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.360
Aum Gam Nirmal Ganapataye.

00:55:59.999 --> 00:56:03.440
To Your powers, Ganesha, let all surrender.

00:56:04.999 --> 00:56:06.840
Let the left side of memory

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.999
and the right side of action surrender to You.

00:56:10.999 --> 00:56:14.040
And let Your enlightenment prevail.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.360
Your first tooth you have and four hands,

00:56:17.999 --> 00:56:20.040
one holding a rope, the second a goad,

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.080
the third is raised in blessings and the forth offers sustenance.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.200
Your banner is that of a humble mouse.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.999
You have long ears and are clothed in red;

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:36.240
red decorates You and You are worshipped with red flowers.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.400
You have compassion for those who love You

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.999
and it is for those who love You, that You came to this earth.

00:56:44.999 --> 00:56:46.840
You are the first that creates,

00:56:46.999 --> 00:56:50.160
the energy that pervades and the Spirit that protects.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.120
Those who seek union with God pray to You.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.920
Those who seek union with God worship You.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.999
Om Gam Nirmal Jesus.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.999
To Your powers, Aum Jesus let all surrender.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.920
Let the left side of memory

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.999
and the left side of action surrender to You,

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.320
and let Your enlightenment prevail.

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:16.040
You are the Word that was at the beginning.

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.480
You are the Word that will be the ending.

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:26.200
You are He who was born of a virgin and died on the cross.

00:57:26.999 --> 00:57:32.999
You are He who absorbs all sins and who died to live again.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:38.040
You are God in man and You are worshipped with red flowers.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.040
You have compassion for those who love You

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:45.160
and it is for those who love You that You come on this earth.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.840
You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades,

00:57:48.999 --> 00:57:51.000
and the Spirit that protects.

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.200
Those who seek union with God pray to You.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.999
Those who seek union with God worship to You.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.480
Shri Ganesha salutations to You.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.040
Shri Jesus salutations to You.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:09.960
He who is the beginning of all worship, salutation to You.

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.120
He who destroys all powers of evil, salutations to You.

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:21.040
Sakshat Son of Lord Shiva who is unending bliss salutations to You.

00:58:21.999 --> 00:58:27.280
Sakshat Son of Mary Mataji who is unending Love salutations to You.

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:31.360
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.999
who is unending joy salutations to You.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.999
We can take now the mantra three times, Shri Adi Bhoomi.

01:00:56.999 --> 01:01:02.080
Now, you have to say the Mother's mantras.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:07.400
and then, we can say, after the [Puja],

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.840
we can go out and then Havan is has to be, Havan, all right?

01:01:13.999 --> 01:01:17.280
Better. And first we have to do the Havan

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.480
with the thousand names of, what we have? Ganesha's have you got?

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.080
Well, we don't have so much, we have hundred and eight.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.920
Of Shri Ganesha?

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.840
Shri Ganesha, yes, maybe we have, I have it somewhere.

01:01:31.999 --> 01:01:36.040
So hundred and eight names of Shri Ganesh you we must [do].

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.280
Better, to establish first of all Shri Ganesha.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.200
Then we can talk of the [unclear] time.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.440
Ganesha and Gauri go together.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.080
Yes, Shri Mataji.

01:02:02.999 --> 01:02:06.999
So we can start with the washing of the Hands,

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.440
[Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu you say]

01:02:09.999 --> 01:02:14.320
and hundred and eight names of Mother after that.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.360
Yes, Shri Mataji.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.999
The Devas said, "Salutation to the Devi, to the Mahadevi.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.999
Salutations always to Her who is ever auspicious.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.280
Salutations to Her who is the primordial cause

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.240
of the sustaining power.

01:02:39.999 --> 01:02:43.280
With attention we have made obeisance to Her.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.960
Salutations to Her who is terrible, to Her who is eternal.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.280
Salutations to Gauri, the supporter of the universe.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.240
Salutations only to Her

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.240
who is of the form of the moon and moonlight, and happiness itself.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.040
We bow to Her who is welfare.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.160
We make salutations to Her who is prosperity and success.

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:13.480
Salutation to the consort of Shiva,

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:18.120
who is Herself the good fortune as well as misfortune of kings.

01:03:19.999 --> 01:03:21.880
Salutations always to Durga.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.999
Fortune for Her children and misfortune for Her enemies.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.360
Salutations always to Durga who takes one across in difficulties,

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.000
who is essence, who is the holder of everything,

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.200
who is knowledge and discrimination,

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.240
and who is blue black and also smoke light in complexion.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.120
We prostrate before Her

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.080
who is at once most gentle and most terrible.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.880
We salute Her again and again.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.160

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.840

who abides in all beings in the form of error, bhranti.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.120
Bhranti means confusion not....

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.840
She creates confusion because without confusion

01:11:45.999 --> 01:11:49.280
ego cannot be all right.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.920
Again.

01:13:05.999 --> 01:13:08.440
Now, there are so many things they have not said.

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:10.920
That shakti rupena samstitah.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.320
SY: Shakti we said, Shri Mataji.
SM: Shakti rupena.

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.840
Viveka rupena, viveka it's discretion, viveka rupena.

01:13:16.999 --> 01:13:19.480
SY: Yes.
SM: Everything comes from Her only.

01:13:20.999 --> 01:13:23.480
God is just a witness.

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:26.320
He's just a witness.

01:13:26.999 --> 01:13:31.999
All other things belong to us from the Mother.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.920
Good. It is done.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.999
Now, you can describe how the Devi is made.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.280
What, what God gives what things to the Devi.

01:14:28.999 --> 01:14:31.240
S.M.: That's a good one.
S.Y.: Absolutely.

01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:35.240
And that you are giving Me now the saris and everything.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.280
You are also Gods now, who are giving Me saris.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.920
Nobody gave Me a sari, right?

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.999
just a little bit more yoghurt and ghee.

01:15:09.999 --> 01:15:13.080
I would like to request maybe Warren to read it,

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.999
S.Y.1: which has better pronunciation than myself.
S.Y.2: No, no yours is good.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.440
It's beautiful.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.999
It's all right? It's all right.

01:16:15.999 --> 01:16:19.000
Put it. Put all the milk now.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.840
SY1: So we do meditation for Mahalakshmi.
SY2: Yes.

01:16:30.999 --> 01:16:33.440
Meditation on Mahalakshmi.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.360
I resort to Mahalakshmi, the destroyer of Mahishasura,

01:16:53.999 --> 01:16:58.160
who is seated on the lotus, is of the complexion of coral

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.280
Now who is this One? Is the Mother of Christ can you imagine?

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.320
She killed Mahishasura

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.960
and She allowed these people to crucify Christ.

01:17:09.999 --> 01:17:15.840
and who holds in Her eighteen hands rosary, axe, mace, arrow,

01:17:15.999 --> 01:17:20.840
thunderbolt, lotus, bow, pitcher, rod,

01:17:20.999 --> 01:17:26.440
shakti, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup,

01:17:26.999 --> 01:17:30.999
trident, noose and the discus Sudarsana.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.999
Now, with all that. All right?

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.999
The Rishi said:

01:17:43.999 --> 01:17:47.440
From yore when Mahisasura was the lord of asuras

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.999
and Indra the lord of devas,

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.840
there was a war between the devas and asuras

01:17:52.999 --> 01:17:55.040
for a full hundred years.

01:17:55.999 --> 01:18:00.360
In that the army of the devas was vanquished by the valorous asuras.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.160
After conquering all the devas,

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.920
Mahishasura became the lord of Heaven.

01:18:08.999 --> 01:18:12.840
Then the vanquished devas headed by Brahma, the lord of beings,

01:18:12.999 --> 01:18:16.920
went to the place where Shiva and Vishnu were.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.160
The devas described to them in detail,

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.880
as it had happened, the story of their defeat wrought by Mahisasura.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:33.880
Mahisasura himself has assumed the jurisdictions of Surya,

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.960
Indra, Agni, Vayu, Chandra, Yama and Varuna and other devas.

01:18:39.999 --> 01:18:44.080
Thrown out from heaven by that evil-natured Mahisha,

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.320
the hosts of devas wander on the earth like mortals.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.840
All that has been done by the enemy of the devas,

01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:57.920
has been related to you both,

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.840
and we have sought shelter under you both.

01:19:01.999 --> 01:19:04.360
May both of you be pleased to think

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.999
out the means of his destruction.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.200
Having thus heard the words of the devas,

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.080
Vishnu was angry and also Shiva,

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.999
and their faces became fierce with frowns.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.240
The issued forth a great light from the face of Vishnu

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.160
who was full of intense anger,

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.840
and from that of Brahma and Shiva too.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.240
From the bodies of Indra and other devas

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.960
also sprang forth a very great light.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:40.160
And all these lights united together.

01:19:41.999 --> 01:19:45.040
The devas saw there a concentration of light

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.999
like a mountain blazing excessively,

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.480
pervading all the quarters with its flames.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.400
Then that unique light, produced from the bodies of all the devas,

01:19:58.999 --> 01:20:01.960
pervading the three worlds with its luster,

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.280
combined into one and became a female form.

01:20:10.999 --> 01:20:13.840
By that which was Shiva's light,

01:20:13.999 --> 01:20:17.120
Her face came into being;

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.999
by Yama's light Her hair,

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.840
by Vishnu's light Her arms;

01:20:23.999 --> 01:20:25.400
You just draw the line, and tell them.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.360
and by Candra's light her two breasts.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:34.000
By Indra's light her waist,

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.840
by Varuna's light her shanks and thighs

01:20:38.999 --> 01:20:39.920
Varuna's?

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:44.160
by Varuna's light her shanks, shanks.

01:20:44.999 --> 01:20:47.840
Varuna's light. The light of Varuna.

01:20:47.999 --> 01:20:50.999
SM: What, what is it?
SY: It creates shanks.

01:20:53.999 --> 01:20:56.160
The upper part of the leg, that [binds].

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.240
SM: Shanks.
SY:  Shanks.

01:21:00.999 --> 01:21:05.240
Varuna is, is the Lord of the sea.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.840
and thighs

01:21:15.999 --> 01:21:20.999
and by earth's light Her hips.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.999
By Brahma's light her feet came into being;

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.240
by Surya's light Her toes,

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:34.999
by Vasus's Her fingers, by Kubera's light Her nose;

01:21:35.999 --> 01:21:39.999
by Prajapati's light Her teeth came into being

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.000
and similarly by Agni's light Her three eyes were formed.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.840
The light of the two sandhyas became her eye-brows,

01:21:50.999 --> 01:21:54.400
the light of Vayu her ears;

01:21:54.999 --> 01:21:58.960
the manifestation of the lights of other devas too

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.080
contributed to the being of the auspicious Devi.

01:22:04.999 --> 01:22:08.160
Then looking at Her, who had come into being

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.040
from the assembled lights of all the devas,

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:16.440
the immortals who were oppressed by Mahisasura experienced joy.

01:22:18.999 --> 01:22:21.999
The bearer of Pinaka

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:27.440
drawing forth a trident from his own trident presented it to Her;

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:33.999
and Vishnu bringing forth a discus out of his own discus gave Her.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.480
Varuna gave Her a conch, Agni a spear;

01:22:39.999 --> 01:22:45.920
and Maruta gave a bow as well as two quivers full of arrows.

01:22:47.999 --> 01:22:51.999
Indra, lord of devas, bringing forth a thunderbolt

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.840
out of his own thunderbolt

01:22:54.999 --> 01:22:58.999
and a bell from that of His elephant Airavata, gave Her.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.360
Yama gave a staff from his own staff of Death

01:23:04.999 --> 01:23:08.999
and Varuna, the lord of waters, a noose;

01:23:09.999 --> 01:23:12.360
and Brahma, the lord of beings,

01:23:12.999 --> 01:23:17.999
gave a string of beads and a water-pot.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:25.200
Surya bestowed His own rays on all the pores of Her skin

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:31.240
and Kala gave a spotless sword and a shield.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.999
The milk-ocean gave a pure necklace,

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:45.200
a pair of garments, a divine crest-jewel, a pair of ear-rings,

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.120

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:53.840
armlets on all arms, a pair of shining anklets,

01:23:53.999 --> 01:23:58.880
a unique necklace and excellent rings on all the fingers.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.840
Visvakarman gave her a very brilliant axe,

01:24:03.999 --> 01:24:09.280
weapons of various forms and also an impenetrable armour.

01:24:09.999 --> 01:24:15.040
The ocean gave her a garland of unfading lotuses for Her head,

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.360
and another for her breast,

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:22.240

The mountain Himavat gave her a lion to ride on a various jewels.

01:24:31.999 --> 01:24:34.160
The lord of wealth Kubera

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.360
gave Her a drinking cup ever full of wine.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.840
Sesha, the lord of all serpents,

01:24:42.999 --> 01:24:47.440
who supports this earth, gave Her a serpent-necklace

01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:51.120
bedecked with best jewels.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:58.080
Rustom has given Me something, bracelet but I haven't brought it.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:06.480
Brought it from, he's brought it from Riad.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.960
From the Arab countries.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.400
All right.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:21.000
Honored likewise by other devas also with ornaments and weapons,

01:25:21.999 --> 01:25:28.000
the Devi gave out a loud roar with a defying laugh again and again.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.999
What's that?

01:25:32.999 --> 01:25:34.999
[Weakening].

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.280
Honored likewise by other devas

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.480

01:25:43.999 --> 01:25:46.999
the Devi gave out a loud roar

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.999
with a defying laugh again and again.

01:25:53.999 --> 01:25:58.400
By her unending, exceedingly great, terrible roar

01:25:58.999 --> 01:26:01.840
the entire sky was filled,

01:26:01.999 --> 01:26:03.000
What are you saying?

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.120
The entire sky was filled by Her roar.

01:26:08.999 --> 01:26:12.200
and there was great reverberation.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.999
All worlds shook, the seas trembled.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.360
The earth quaked and all the mountains rocked.

01:26:22.999 --> 01:26:29.999
"Victory to you", exclaimed the devas in joy to Her, the lion-rider.

01:26:30.999 --> 01:26:35.999
The sages, who bowed their bodies in devotion, extolled her.

01:26:36.999 --> 01:26:41.840
Seeing the three worlds agitated, the foes of devas,

01:26:41.999 --> 01:26:45.840
mobilized all their armies and rose up together

01:26:45.999 --> 01:26:49.400
with uplifted weapons.

01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:55.160
Mahishasura, exclaiming in wrath, 'Ha! What is this?'

01:26:55.999 --> 01:27:01.160
rushed towards that roar, surrounded by the innumerable asuras.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.240
Then he saw the Devi pervading the three worlds with her lustre.

01:27:06.999 --> 01:27:09.040
Lustre? I don't know.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.880
Making the earth bend with Her footstep,

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.999
scraping the sky with Her diadem,

01:27:24.999 --> 01:27:29.480
shaking the nether worlds with the twang of Her bowstring,

01:27:29.999 --> 01:27:32.960
and standing there pervading all the quarters around

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.240
with her thousand arms.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.840
Then began a battle between that Devi and the enemies of the devas,

01:27:41.999 --> 01:27:45.360
in which the quarters of the sky were illumined

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.960
by the weapons and arms hurled diversely.

01:27:51.999 --> 01:27:57.840
Mahisasura's general, a great asura named Chiksura and Chamara,

01:27:57.999 --> 01:28:03.240
attended by forces comprising four parts, and other asuras fought.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.200
A great asura named Udagraha with sixty thousand chariots,

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.999
and Mahahanu with ten millions

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:14.999
Must be the one with so many Rolls Royces.

01:28:19.999 --> 01:28:22.160
Can be.

01:28:29.999 --> 01:28:35.400
and Mahahanu with ten millions of chariots gave battle.

01:28:36.999 --> 01:28:41.840
Asiloman, another great asura, with fifteen millions of chariots,

01:28:41.999 --> 01:28:47.160
and Bashkala with six millions fought in that battle.

01:28:48.999 --> 01:28:53.000
Privarita with many thousands of elephants and horses,

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.920
and surrounded by ten millions of chariots, fought in that battle.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.280
Just imagine. So you can understand these rakshasas

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.000
in modern times also are having so many Rolls Royces,

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.840
so many people following them,

01:29:06.999 --> 01:29:08.800
thousands and thousands, look at that.

01:29:08.999 --> 01:29:10.960
And only one Goddess to fight.

01:29:19.999 --> 01:29:22.920
An asura named Bidala

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:29.200
fought in that battle surrounded by five crores of chariots.

01:29:29.999 --> 01:29:32.920
Crores.

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:40.960
I mean a chariot I think is equal to the price of a one hundred

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:46.880
or maybe one thousand of Rolls Royces. So it's all right.

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.480
They have completed their amount.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.920
And other great asuras, thousands in number,

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.280
surrounded with chariots, elephants and horses

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.400
fought with the Devi in that battle.

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.840
Now you should understand how the asuras had such a powerful army,

01:30:08.999 --> 01:30:10.440
had so many people to fight,

01:30:10.999 --> 01:30:14.840
had such big elephants and all those things

01:30:14.999 --> 01:30:18.040
showing how much money they must be having.

01:30:18.999 --> 01:30:22.320
And that's what you see today also, same thing.

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.840
They have all the money, they have all the chariots,

01:30:25.999 --> 01:30:29.400
they have everything, elephants and everything to fight,

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.840
but they are not successful.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.840
Mahishasura was surrounded in the battle

01:30:48.999 --> 01:30:53.960
with thousands or crores of hordes, horses, elephants and chariots.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:59.480
Other asuras fought in the battle against the Devi

01:30:59.999 --> 01:31:04.240
with iron maces and javelins, with spears and clubs,

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:08.999
with swords, axes and halberds.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:13.999
Some hurled spears and others nooses.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:19.999
They began to strike Her with swords in order to kill Her.

01:31:20.999 --> 01:31:25.160
Showering Her own weapons and arms, that Devi Chandika

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:30.440
very easily cut into pieces all those weapons and arms.

01:31:33.999 --> 01:31:36.880
Without any strain on Her face

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.280
and with gods and sages extolling her,

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.999
the Ishvari threw Her weapons and arms at the bodies of the asuras.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.920
And the lion also which carried the Devi

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.920
shaking its mane in rage,

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.920
stalked among the hordes of the asuras

01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:00.480
like a conflagration amidst the forest.

01:32:01.999 --> 01:32:05.960
The side which Ambika, engaged in the battle,

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:10.999
heaved became at once her battalions by hundreds and thousands.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.160
Energized by the power of the Devi,

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.240
these battalions fought with battle-axes, javelins, swords

01:32:19.999 --> 01:32:22.920
and destroyed the asuras.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:27.840
All these battalions, some beat drums,

01:32:27.999 --> 01:32:31.920
some blew conches and others played on tabors

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.400
in that great martial festival.

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:41.160
Then the Devi killed hundreds of asuras with Her trident, club,

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:45.840
showers of spears, swords and the like,

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:51.400
and threw down others who were stupefied by the noise of Her bell;

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:58.080
and binding others with Her noose, She dragged them on the ground.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:04.240
Some were split into two by the sharp slashes of Her sword,

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.840
and others, smashed by the blows of Her mace,

01:33:07.999 --> 01:33:09.960
lay down on the ground;

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:15.920
and some severely hammered by Her club vomited forth blood.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:24.880
Pierced in the breast by her trident, some fell on the ground.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:29.840
Pierced all over by Her arrows and resembling porcupines,

01:33:29.999 --> 01:33:33.160
some of the enemies of devas gave up their lives

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.960
on that field of battle.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:41.320
Some had their arms cut off, some, their necks broken

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:44.920
the heads of others rolled down;

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:50.880
some others were torn asunder in the middle of their trunks,

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:57.280
and some great asuras fell on the ground with their legs severed.

01:33:59.999 --> 01:34:03.320
Some rendered one-armed, one-eyed,

01:34:03.999 --> 01:34:07.999
and one-legged were again clove in twain by the Devi.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.920
And others, though rendered headless, fell and rose again.

01:34:15.999 --> 01:34:18.320
Headless trunks fought with the Devi

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.400
with best weapons in their hands.

01:34:21.999 --> 01:34:26.000
Some of these headless trunks danced there in the battle

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.120
to the rhythm of the musical instruments.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.840
The trunks of some other great asuras, with their swords,

01:34:34.999 --> 01:34:37.840
spears and lances still in their hands,

01:34:37.999 --> 01:34:43.840
shouted at the Devi with their just severed heads, 'Stop, stop'.

01:34:43.999 --> 01:34:46.920
That part of earth where the battle was fought

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.999
became impassable with the asuras,

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.120
elephants and horses and chariots that had been felled.

01:34:55.999 --> 01:35:00.400
The profuse blood from the asuras, elephants and horses

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.999
flowed immediately like large rivers amidst that army of the asuras.

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.280
As fire consumes a huge heap of straw and wood,

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.920
so did Ambika destroy that vast army of asuras in no time.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:28.080
And her carrier-lion, thundering aloud with quivering mane,

01:35:28.999 --> 01:35:32.840
prowled about in the battlefield,

01:35:32.999 --> 01:35:35.200
appearing to search out the vital breaths

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.480
from the bodies of the enemies of devas.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.240
In that battlefield the battalions of the Devi

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.880
fought in such a manner with the asuras

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.999
that the devas in heaven, showering flowers, extolled them.

01:36:06.999 --> 01:36:10.160
Now, you may say hundred and eight names.

01:36:22.999 --> 01:36:25.160
And the translation?

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.999
I have the translation only in German, Shri Mataji.

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.000
Get seven married ladies.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.960
Married ladies, seven.

01:37:12.999 --> 01:37:15.880
Two are there. Five more.

01:37:33.999 --> 01:37:36.840
She is the Holy Mother.

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.440
She does not only give what a loving Mother gives to Her children,

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.440
but She also gives the highest knowledge,

01:37:45.999 --> 01:37:48.840
the purest knowledge, the Brahma vidya,

01:37:48.999 --> 01:37:53.920
the knowledge about the holy, divine vibrations to Her devotees.

01:37:59.999 --> 01:38:02.400
She is the Great Empress.

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.999
She appears for a divine purpose.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.360
She is beyond kula, which is the

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.960
countable dimension in us.

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.999
She resides in the Sahasrara.

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.999
She cuts the knots of the maya, the granthis.

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.200
All of them have to say.

01:38:42.999 --> 01:38:45.360
You take the name.

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.120
You say the name first.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.999
Married lady, one more.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.880
One minute. There are three saris now, because last time

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.960
I didn't take a Mother's sari from the French Sahaja Yogis.

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.840
and the Guru's sari also so they have now said that

01:41:38.999 --> 01:41:43.160
"Mother in this Puja, we'd like to give you".

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.360
So that's how we have now three saris for Trigunatmika.

01:41:47.999 --> 01:41:53.800
So the first one is for the Mahakali Shakti.

01:41:53.999 --> 01:41:55.400
This is the Bhoomi.

01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.040
See how correctly it has come the colour of the Bhoomi.

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.240
That's Mahakali. Then you have got the Mahasarawati sari,

01:42:07.999 --> 01:42:11.960
which is the color of the

01:42:13.999 --> 01:42:16.880
what we call the actual color of the prithvi tattwa

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.840
because matter, of the matter.

01:42:19.999 --> 01:42:23.160
The second, third one is the Mahalakshmi's color

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.840
which Mary used to wear very much

01:42:25.999 --> 01:42:27.960
So that's how we have got three colors.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.400
But I was amazed when I was coming from the program

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.080
the whole sky was filled Mahalakshmi's color.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.840
I saw it myself, everybody saw the sky.

01:42:35.999 --> 01:42:39.080
So this is what it is that we have now got,

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.960
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,  in this place

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.400
because it's a holy land, and we got all the three centers,

01:42:46.999 --> 01:42:51.240
three nadis being represented. This is the first time

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:55.800
we have got three nadis represented in a place.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.800
But that happened because I didn't accept it for the Guru Puja,

01:43:00.999 --> 01:43:04.840
so they have sent it here. See this one.

01:43:04.999 --> 01:43:06.920
Now, open this out.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.040
Seven or four. Just tell them to get up.

01:43:35.999 --> 01:43:37.999
Show it to everyone.

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:49.080
Here, Mr.[Vadha's] sari is containing the guru sat.

01:44:49.999 --> 01:44:53.480
Here also. This is the guru sari has come.

01:44:53.999 --> 01:44:56.999
Guru is the Brahmadeva, is the One, the Creator

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:02.040
and His power is that of Mahasaraswati. And this is what is the sari

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.840
they were going to give Me for Guru Puja. Now it has come.

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:09.240
It has got five lines, which shows the five

01:45:11.999 --> 01:45:15.240
elements that the Brahmadeva has.

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.840
So this is the Mahasaraswati's. How correct it is, see.

01:45:18.999 --> 01:45:21.240
Now, open it.

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.240
And five and five makes ten.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.080
That's how the guru has got ten principles,

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.999
five on the right and five on the left.

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.840
Now, this is Mahalakshmi.

01:46:30.999 --> 01:46:36.120
This is the color I saw in the sky which I had never seen before.

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.240
This is the sari from Holland.

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.800
Mangalasutra is not there?

02:05:02.999 --> 02:05:05.999
Now you take the photographs.

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:35.840
O Devi, you who remove the sufferings of your suppliants,

02:05:35.999 --> 02:05:37.999
be gracious.

02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.999
Be propitious, oh Mother of the whole world.

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:48.160
Be gracious, oh Mother of the universe. Protect the universe.

02:05:48.999 --> 02:05:54.360
You are, oh Devi, the ruler of all that is moving and unmoving.

02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:58.840
You are the sole substratum of all the world,

02:05:58.999 --> 02:06:02.400
because You subsist in the form of the earth.

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:05.840
By you, who exist in the shape of water,

02:06:05.999 --> 02:06:09.320
all this universe is gratified, oh Devi.

02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:20.999
You are the power of Vishnu, and have endless valor.

02:06:21.999 --> 02:06:27.200
You are the primordial maya, which is the source of the universe;

02:06:27.999 --> 02:06:33.999
by you all this universe has been thrown into an illusion, oh Devi.

02:06:35.999 --> 02:06:39.200
If you become gracious, you become the cause

02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:42.960
of final emancipation in this world.

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:46.999
Ha, I'm already that.

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:13.999
Take the whole, you see.

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:20.960
I will be [unclear]you to start because you can take at the Feet

02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:23.999
the whole [thing] of salutations.

02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:59.999
Salutations be to You, oh Nirmala Devi,

02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:04.400
oh You who abides as intelligence in the heart of all creatures,

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:08.999
and bestow enjoyment and liberation.

02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:14.800
Salutations be to You oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:08:14.999 --> 02:08:18.080
oh You, who in the form of minutes, moments,

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:22.240
and other divisions of time bring about change in things

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.999
and have thus the power to destroy the universe.

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.960
Salutations be to You oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:35.440

Salutations be to You, oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:08:47.999 --> 02:08:50.840
You who have the power of creation,

02:08:50.999 --> 02:08:55.080
sustentation and destruction and are eternal.

02:08:55.999 --> 02:09:00.920
You are the substratum and embodiment of the trigunas.

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:04.840
Salutations be to You, oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.999
oh You, who are intent on saving the dejected and distressed

02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:13.080
that take refuge under You.

02:09:13.999 --> 02:09:18.840
Oh, You, Devi who remove the sufferings of all.

02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:22.960
Salutations be to You, oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.200
oh You, who ride in the heavenly chariot,

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:30.120
yoked with swans and assume the form of Brahmani.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:35.200
Oh Devi, who sprinkle water with kusha grass.

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:40.880
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.040
oh You, who bear the trident, the moon and the serpent,

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.440
and ride a big bull and have the form of Maheshvari.

02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:54.240
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:58.120
oh You who are attended by the peacock and cock

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.480
and bear a great spare,

02:10:00.999 --> 02:10:05.320
oh You, who are sinless and take the form of Kaumari.

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:09.999
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:14.400
oh You, who hold the great weapons of conch, discus, club and bow,

02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:18.280
and take the form of Vaishnavi, be gracious.

02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.200
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:26.320
oh You, who grasp a huge formidable discus,

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:29.880
and uplift the earth with thy tusk,

02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:35.480
oh, auspicious Devi, who has a boar-like form.

02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:39.999
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.840
oh You who is the fierce form of a man-lion,

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.240
put forth your efforts to sly the daityas,

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.480
oh You who possess the benevolence of saving the three worlds.

02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.880
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:02.999
you who have a diadem and a great thunderbolt,

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:08.320

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.160
oh Aindri!

02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.160
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:18.960
oh You who in the form of Shivaduti,

02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:23.080
slew the mighty hosts of the daityas,

02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:27.440
oh You of terrible form and loud throat!

02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.360
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:11:33.999 --> 02:11:37.400
oh You who have a face terrible with tusks,

02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:41.480
and are adorned with a garland of heads, oh Chamunda,

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.200
oh slayer of Munda!

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:48.080
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.960
oh You who are good fortune, modesty, great wisdom, faith,

02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:57.280
nourishment and Svadha,

02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.960
oh You who are immovable, oh You, great Night and great Illusion.

02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:07.320
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:10.999
oh You who are intelligence and Sarasvati,

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:15.400
oh best One, prosperity, consort of Vishnu,

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:20.200
dark One, nature, be propitious.

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:26.360
Oh Queen of all, You who exist in the form of all,

02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:28.999
and possess every might,

02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:32.880
save us from error, oh Devi.

02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:36.080
Salutation be to you, Devi Durga.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:44.440
May this benign countenance of Yours adorned with three eyes,

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:47.440
protect us from all fears.

02:12:47.999 --> 02:12:51.800
Salutation be to You, Nirmala Devi.

02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:56.840
Terrible with flames, exceedingly sharp

02:12:56.999 --> 02:12:59.160
destroyer of all the asuras,

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:02.999
may your trident guard us from fear.

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:08.080
Salutation be to You, Shri Nirmala Devi.

02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.800
They haven't got, there, some of them. They haven't got yet.

02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:14.720
You must give it to a small boy, because she can see.

02:14:15.999 --> 02:14:18.999
SM: Give it to her.
SY: Matin.

02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.480
The main Pujari hasn't got it.

02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:01.720
Here's the one.

02:15:27.999 --> 02:15:30.960
Give it to the children.

02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:35.880
I think they have it all, the children.

02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:55.240
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be, let it be.

02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:58.800
Let it be. She's always like that, let it be.

02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:03.320
She's been always.... Forget it, forget it.

02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:09.240
She's always caught up child. She is a caught up child.

02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:12.920
Comes up, goes down, comes up, goes down.

02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:22.880
Arti, all the children have got it.

02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:27.280
Then I will not take flowers from you.

02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:30.680
All right?

02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:41.480
She's always a caught up child.

02:16:43.999 --> 02:16:47.080
They have been always worried about her. It's all right.

02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:52.760
She'll be all right.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:03.240
You want to do the aarti?

02:17:04.999 --> 02:17:07.320
You were forgetting all.

02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:16.880
I think the Feet should be taken on this one.

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:30.240
Take out.

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:36.960
Put the flowers. It's all right.

02:18:54.999 --> 02:18:58.480
Take one photo. Close. Get one photograph.

02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:03.720
Now it's all right.

02:28:11.999 --> 02:28:14.920
May God bless you all.

02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:57.999
May God bless you. May God bless you.

02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:03.760
You too have got three colors.

02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:30.360
Very fine, except little [unclear].

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:34.999
And here you have to put a line.

02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:42.000
If you put a line these My eyes come up, you see.

02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:46.999
You put a line like that. And like this, this much.

02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:50.120
All right?

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:53.999
Little smaller lips, lower lip smaller, upper one is all right.

02:32:55.160 --> 02:32:57.840
This one is to be stretched a little.

02:32:57.999 --> 02:33:01.999
This is smaller and these eyes have got a little line here.

02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:04.920
All right?

02:33:17.999 --> 02:33:22.000
Eyes is to be brought out little more that side. Little more.

02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:25.440
They look small, you see. They are bigger than that.

02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:32.999
Oh, what is that?

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:34.999
French Sahaja Yogis?

02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:38.760
But they have already given Me a beautiful thing.

02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:43.999
He's not come, here? Patrick?

02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:47.999
SY: He's coming at [Christmas].
SM: He wants a break.

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:50.999
SY: He may come to weekends Mother.
SM: I see.

02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:54.440
But I wanted to meet him. All right.

02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:59.280
SY: He may come tonight.
SM: May come.

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:09.999
He would have been happy to see that I took the saris. [unclear].

02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:22.960
There should not be anything better than that.

02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:37.840
How did you make these hands?

02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:41.960
SM: You ordered?
SY: No, I found them somewhere.

02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:46.480
You found them? They are just like My hands.

02:34:57.800 --> 02:34:59.680
It's beautiful.

02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:07.960
Our heart is in Your hands Shri Mataji.

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:12.880
Thank you very much. It's beautiful.

02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:26.999
This is a heart, it's made of the glass. So one has to be careful,

02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:31.080
in handling it, look out.

02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:34.160
Out of these two.

02:35:39.999 --> 02:35:42.320
Thank you very much.

02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:23.760
Hello. Look at them.

02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.280
Such nice girls, aren't you?

02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.800
Thank you, thank you.

02:36:31.999 --> 02:36:34.480
But Arti why are you afraid?

02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:39.960
See now, they are not afraid.

02:36:49.999 --> 02:36:54.800
You know, I've been to them.

02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:11.320
Beautiful. Oh, you got it, Ann, from there?

02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:15.720
How?

02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:44.840
Thank you very much.

02:37:44.999 --> 02:37:49.840
Now, see, all the children are giving Me flowers. May God bless you.

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:52.999
Nobody's crying.

02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:56.360
All right?

02:37:57.360 --> 02:37:59.840
Keep somewhere. One person.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.320
See now. Who has done that?

02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:22.760
This is you have done? Oh, great.

02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:32.999
Good.

02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:37.400
That's a good one.

02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:48.999
What is this?

02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:52.480
That is from English [with all heart] for Dutch Sahaja Yogis.

02:38:52.999 --> 02:38:54.840
English Sahaja Yogis?

02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:58.880
For the Dutch Sahaja Yogis. For the Dutch Sahaja Yogis he said.

02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:03.080
SY: From the English?
SM: From the English to the Dutch?

02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:07.440
All right. I'm opening for you, you don't mind.

02:39:09.999 --> 02:39:12.880
Ha. Now you open.

02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:16.920
Take out but this is quite a big opening. Beautiful.

02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:23.360
I'll take out and see. There must be a photograph.

02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:08.160
With a smile, just imagine. Fantastic.

02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:13.920
Actually first time I saw it.

02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:17.160
I said "What a face".

02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:24.040
Smile becoming a light.

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:25.760
Shri Mataji, this is a present

02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:29.040
from all the present Sahaja Yogis here.

02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:32.720
Oh, it's too much [indeed]. Too much.

02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:42.040
This is the present of the presents.

02:40:42.999 --> 02:40:47.200
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:53.800
Was there the painting like this?

02:40:53.999 --> 02:40:57.999
I think this is the original image, [after watching this also].

02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:02.240
This is the painting. Beautiful. You must see this.

02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:23.999
This is made in Holland?

02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:25.840
SY1: No, it's made in West Germany, Mother.

02:41:25.999 --> 02:41:28.400
SY2: Austria.
SY1: West Germany.

02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:31.440
West Germany? I see.

02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:34.999
May God bless West Germany.

02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:47.960
I saw this work in New Zealand, you'll be surprised.

02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:52.440
But maybe, it might be Japanese, I don't know, but I saw it.

02:41:57.999 --> 02:42:00.999
And this is a present from the Sahaja Yogis here

02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:05.040
for the Dutch Sahaja Yogis.

02:42:18.999 --> 02:42:20.960
It will have double purpose.

02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:23.480
To save a lot of money for Sahaja Yoga.

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:28.200
Also double purpose. Shoes, you see.

02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:31.680
The bhoots run away from shoes. Good idea.

02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:47.920
SM: From where?
SY: From Milan.

02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:53.120
It's from you? Or from Milan?

02:42:53.999 --> 02:42:57.080
From Italy.

02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:11.320
That's a painting? This is a painting?

02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.240
Yes, Mother, I think.

02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:21.480
It's painted by Adolf Eberle. [unclear]

02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:25.360
Because it's the real, this is the real important [start]

02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:27.840
for our crusade now, the young crusade

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.640
because this is all the people, yes?

02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.760
And you see they protest but there is [unclear].

02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:42.320
and there is a lady with her child and whole looking is on the lady.

02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:49.080
And she is also moving and sees really the people who are going...

02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:51.480
Forward.

02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:56.760
SM: Forward.
SY: Forward.

02:43:58.080 --> 02:43:59.480
Who has done the painting?

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:04.080
It is painted by Adolf Eberle and the painting is in Milano.

02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:13.680
The name of the thing is not there.

02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:18.240
SY: I'll write it.
SM: You write it down here. Thank you very much.

02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:23.400
You must have the painting of all the Sahaja Yogis like this,

02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:26.880
it would be a good idea.

02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:40.680
Shri Mataji, [unclear]

02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:44.080
and we would like You to give it to destination.

02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:45.840
You feel the vibrations.

02:44:45.999 --> 02:44:49.640
Give it to destination, Mother. Give it to some center.

02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:02.680
I would say we should give it to Australia.

02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:19.999
It's  a responsibility.

02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:23.160
Very big responsibility.

02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:27.320
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:29.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:33.240
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:40.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:44.640
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:46.680
Very beautiful.

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:50.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:45:53.999 --> 02:45:56.240
So kind of him.

02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:06.160
So the ladies who have washed My Feet

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.920
and the ones who gave Me saris, please come along.

02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:21.320
Now, you should go and have your lunch I think.

02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:26.480
Noodles, in half an hour you will starve, you see.

02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:40.400
I think I'll give them too. Better.

02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:51.760
SM: I give. You, Esther, got it?
SY: No, Shri Mataji.

02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:54.680
Then you take it.

02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:57.040
Now, take it.

02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:00.440
So if everyone has got it, I am sorry.

02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:27.440
SM: What's that?
SY: Present for You, Mother.

02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:30.040
From you?

02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:37.400
So many hearts. All right, open it.

02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.920
So we have eight and this is the ninth.

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:13.400
We really needed the ninth one.

02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:27.080
Oh, this is the tenth one.

02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:36.840
This is Alsatian, na?

02:48:36.999 --> 02:48:39.160
We will have. And we didn't have this one either.

02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:41.920
SY: Dalmatian, Mother.
SM: What that was?

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:45.400
Dalmatian? Good. Thank you.

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:50.280
SY: Now we have ten Mother.
SM: Now, I have ten.

02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:53.320
One more I must get. I'll buy Myself.

02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:57.640
Let My husband buy something for Me.

02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:00.840
These are the bangles for the ladies who are here.

02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:03.840
Very graciously.

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:06.840
Yogi Mahajan has come all the way from India.

02:49:06.999 --> 02:49:09.880
We have to thank him very much.

02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:23.840
And he has brought these beautiful bangles for the ladies.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:27.560
Please, give one each to anyone.

02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:34.480
All right, go ahead for your food. I don't want you to starve.

02:49:34.999 --> 02:49:37.800
What does he want? A doggy?

02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:40.640
Daddy, daddy, Shri Mataji.

02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:42.080
He wants to go to daddy.

02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:45.120
Daddy? Why to daddy?

02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:50.720
You better have some chana.

02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:54.999
All right? Take some chana.

02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:58.240
Daddy doesn't have any chana. Nothing he has.

02:49:58.999 --> 02:50:02.120
You come the other way round.

02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:04.999
Now, take some chana. Come. Little more.

02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:09.320
He can come. Let all the children have the chana.

02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.160
All those children who want chana, come here, all right?

02:50:16.999 --> 02:50:21.600
All want chana. That's it.

02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:32.080
That is too small. Which one is there? Come along.

02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:47.280
Here is the chana.

02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:53.920
Child is not well, Rajan. You have to see her. All right?

02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:59.720
SM: Father has come?
SY: Oh, yes, he's come Mother.

02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:03.480
SY: He's feeling well now.
SM: What all the doctors are saying?

02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:06.720
We don't know. Expecting answers.

02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:08.840
Is she all right? I mean, out of danger?

02:51:08.999 --> 02:51:12.640
Yes, she's out of danger now. Just she'll maybe go home today.

02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:13.840
Oh that's good.

02:51:13.999 --> 02:51:15.560
Just, just five minutes ago,

02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:17.840
someone has phoned from the hospital Shri Mataji,

02:51:17.999 --> 02:51:20.720
that they can be fetched in a car from there.

02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:24.480
She can be fetched. That's good. That's like a Sahaja Yogini.

02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:27.999
All right, but now I would suggest that when she goes back

02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:31.360
let her stay here for a while and then go all the ladies,

02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:32.999
let them go by train.

02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:36.240
And [if it's somebody's] little van is too small.

02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:38.720
And next time it should be a law,

02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:42.720
anybody carrying a child in the lap is not allowed to come.

02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:45.120
All right? That is the status to be able to walk around

02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:46.760
and not in such a way.

02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:48.760
One should not do this way.

02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:51.680
And pregnant women are not allowed at all to come.

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:55.800
You know that. That's not to be agreed to

02:51:55.999 --> 02:51:57.560
at any cost, whatever it is, you see.

02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:00.280
It's very dangerous, it worries Me.

02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:02.960
Thank God she is all right because of Sahaja Yoga.

02:52:03.120 --> 02:52:05.320
She's perfectly all right and she comes back home.

02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:08.680
So that's a good thing. Come.

02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:14.400
But next time make it a point, please make it a point.

02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:22.640
Only flowers.

02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:30.280
SM: Have I given you already.
SY: Yes.

02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:36.080
So, try to understand that, you see, the pregnancy,

02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:38.720
you have to be very careful.

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:43.160
If you have your own car, all right, if you can have [unclear]

02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:46.999
if you can travel with someone else, it's all right.

02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:49.880
That too in early pregnancy

02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:52.400
not in the very advanced pregnancy.

02:52:52.680 --> 02:52:56.920
Because you have come here to help Me in a way,

02:52:57.999 --> 02:53:00.160
and also to get help from Me.

02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:04.320
But if you come during pregnancy at a very advanced stage

02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:07.600
it can create a problem, you see.

02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:12.360
So be careful not to do such a thing anymore.

02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:15.960
And if there are ladies travelling,

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:18.960
it's better they travel by train with small children,

02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:22.320
but never a child who is not yet walking.

02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:27.160
If the child is not walking the ladies must stay at home.

02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:32.320
Please remember that, it's a law, that we do not allow

02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:34.999
anybody to come to India with the children.

02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:38.560
Now, if you have got children, and you want to come to India,

02:53:38.760 --> 02:53:40.800
then do only one small thing.

02:53:40.999 --> 02:53:44.880
You notify that you want, "we have got children" and

02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:49.400
we could find out some crèche in Switzerland,

02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:54.240
in Rome, in England, anywhere,

02:53:54.760 --> 02:53:59.000
for these children to be left there. And you can come free,

02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:01.960
freely there. That is important.

02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:05.960
But if the child is very small, I would say, don't come.

02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:09.400
But even children are not to be brought to India.

02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:13.280
So all the children can be kept there. It is during holiday time,

02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:15.440
we are having this time the program.

02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:18.760
So please do not bring children to India.

02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:22.999
Try to keep the children. They can be kept somewhere, not difficult.

02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:27.960
We can form some crèche in the ashrams and we can manage that.

02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:32.200
All right. So now and have your food.

02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:34.240
Somebody must go and keep the door open.

02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:36.240
Please put your hand in the door.

02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:40.200
Shri Mataji, this is the last Puja, for the whole tour of Europe.

02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:43.640
From all the Sahaja Yogis we want to thank you for the tremendous,

02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:48.360
beautifully, enjoible tour that you gave us all. Jai Shri Mataji.
