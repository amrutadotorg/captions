WEBVTT

00:02.710 --> 00:07.066
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

00:07.226 --> 00:11.085
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

00:11.327 --> 00:14.311
I don’t know what to say.

00:16.827 --> 00:20.534
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

00:20.694 --> 00:25.472
because most of you come from a culture

00:25.632 --> 00:29.402
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

00:29.562 --> 00:33.500
They never realised how important it was that,

00:33.999 --> 00:37.849
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

00:39.522 --> 00:44.593
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

00:46.937 --> 00:54.804
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

00:55.155 --> 01:00.468
And also the desire to know the Divine

01:09.310 --> 01:12.382
vanishes also in the thin air

01:13.015 --> 01:18.937
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

01:20.179 --> 01:24.405
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

01:25.030 --> 01:33.733
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

01:34.038 --> 01:38.804
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

01:39.304 --> 01:47.764
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

01:49.170 --> 01:54.035
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

01:58.292 --> 02:08.382
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

02:08.542 --> 02:14.327
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

02:17.163 --> 02:22.846
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

02:23.006 --> 02:26.933
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

02:27.093 --> 02:29.605
and entertained us the most.

02:29.765 --> 02:33.042
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

02:33.202 --> 02:38.028
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

02:38.303 --> 02:41.929
and they think that you are laughing at them.

02:45.663 --> 02:53.101
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

02:53.584 --> 02:59.651
was more than what one would expect

02:59.811 --> 03:04.921
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

03:05.081 --> 03:10.945
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

03:11.105 --> 03:13.402
that made us so happy.

03:14.183 --> 03:20.039
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

03:20.199 --> 03:27.004
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

03:27.941 --> 03:32.867
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

03:33.027 --> 03:36.949
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

03:38.019 --> 03:43.445
His manifestation within you is so evident.

03:43.605 --> 03:48.785
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

03:49.230 --> 03:51.777
so very different from other people.

03:52.870 --> 03:56.238
One day I was travelling from London

03:56.964 --> 04:02.624
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

04:02.784 --> 04:08.007
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

04:08.167 --> 04:15.909
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

04:16.581 --> 04:21.460
I asked her, “Who are you?”

04:21.620 --> 04:25.491
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

04:25.756 --> 04:31.273
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

04:31.433 --> 04:34.308
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

04:36.464 --> 04:40.808
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

04:41.863 --> 04:47.226
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

04:47.386 --> 04:50.581
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

04:51.394 --> 04:59.230
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

05:00.331 --> 05:04.253
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

05:04.597 --> 05:07.406
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

05:07.566 --> 05:12.499
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

05:12.659 --> 05:15.425
He’s not talked about the source.

05:18.995 --> 05:21.949
I said, “Better find out,

05:22.495 --> 05:26.874
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

05:27.034 --> 05:32.734
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

05:32.894 --> 05:36.855
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

05:37.917 --> 05:44.636
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

05:44.980 --> 05:46.609
and not by the Father.

05:46.769 --> 05:49.703
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

05:49.863 --> 05:55.124
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

05:55.284 --> 05:58.570
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

05:58.730 --> 06:10.339
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

06:10.753 --> 06:15.417
also about the Jews.

06:16.472 --> 06:21.851
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

06:22.011 --> 06:24.409
nor about Shri Ganesh.

06:26.190 --> 06:33.578
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

06:33.738 --> 06:41.398
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

06:41.558 --> 06:47.199
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

06:50.534 --> 06:54.835
So now, when we deal with our children,

06:54.995 --> 07:00.882
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

07:01.042 --> 07:05.323
they are very innocent, very simple;

07:05.761 --> 07:11.343
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

07:11.503 --> 07:14.198
and they lose their moorings.

07:18.058 --> 07:25.070
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

07:25.230 --> 07:30.136
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

07:30.574 --> 07:37.871
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

07:38.667 --> 07:43.011
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

07:44.291 --> 07:50.265
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

07:50.425 --> 07:53.722
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

07:54.495 --> 07:58.151
But you should know He is on every chakra.

07:59.261 --> 08:08.718
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

08:08.878 --> 08:11.151
specially the spiritual one.

08:12.191 --> 08:16.675
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

08:18.386 --> 08:22.730
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

08:23.511 --> 08:30.261
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

08:31.136 --> 08:40.019
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

08:41.605 --> 08:48.727
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

08:48.887 --> 08:50.581
It was Sahaj.

08:51.206 --> 08:57.710
The life before Self-realisation was different.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.225
You got your transformation

09:00.385 --> 09:10.276
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

09:11.312 --> 09:13.812
But here now we have to see

09:13.972 --> 09:19.062
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

09:19.222 --> 09:24.001
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

09:24.161 --> 09:32.382
you have to cure people, you have to love them

09:32.542 --> 09:35.148
and you have to be compassionate

09:35.308 --> 09:43.109
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

09:43.269 --> 09:47.914
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

09:48.074 --> 09:57.521
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

09:57.692 --> 10:00.411
You can project it to others.

10:00.700 --> 10:08.723
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

10:09.809 --> 10:15.747
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

10:16.614 --> 10:20.905
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

10:21.065 --> 10:25.725
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

10:25.885 --> 10:29.256
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

10:29.416 --> 10:33.913
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

10:34.073 --> 10:37.014
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

10:37.174 --> 10:39.358
This is what you have to practise,

10:39.518 --> 10:45.932
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

10:46.103 --> 10:51.685
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

10:52.559 --> 10:55.241
Now, for example, say

10:59.763 --> 11:05.285
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

11:05.445 --> 11:09.202
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

11:09.362 --> 11:14.905
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

11:15.065 --> 11:19.299
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

11:20.729 --> 11:28.518
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

11:29.409 --> 11:36.639
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

11:36.799 --> 11:43.369
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

11:44.439 --> 11:46.370
Not very difficult.

11:46.721 --> 11:51.499
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

11:51.659 --> 11:57.464
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

11:59.915 --> 12:02.788
The energy will diminish.

12:02.948 --> 12:09.901
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

12:11.002 --> 12:16.849
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

12:17.009 --> 12:19.333
you are not ordinary people

12:19.493 --> 12:24.806
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

12:25.548 --> 12:34.552
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

12:34.712 --> 12:38.204
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

12:39.571 --> 12:43.325
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

12:43.485 --> 12:49.381
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

12:49.541 --> 12:52.817
or how to deliberately do this.

12:52.977 --> 12:56.052
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

12:56.212 --> 12:59.669
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

12:59.829 --> 13:12.005
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

13:12.165 --> 13:16.212
but just your majestic personality.

13:17.227 --> 13:21.071
This personality is here now, you see,

13:21.969 --> 13:25.711
is sitting in such a majestic manner

13:26.899 --> 13:32.997
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

13:33.157 --> 13:42.462
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

13:44.784 --> 13:49.591
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

13:49.751 --> 13:52.954
I don’t think is alright.

13:53.259 --> 13:58.528
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

13:58.688 --> 14:02.055
so much ego, so much conditioning.

14:02.602 --> 14:09.872
But something within you can rise above others

14:10.032 --> 14:20.454
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

14:20.891 --> 14:23.122
where you stand with yourself.

14:23.282 --> 14:27.059
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

14:27.219 --> 14:31.864
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

14:32.024 --> 14:40.071
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

14:40.320 --> 14:45.338
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

14:45.498 --> 14:52.107
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.718
But the innocence that you have,

14:56.601 --> 15:01.745
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

15:01.905 --> 15:08.967
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

15:09.127 --> 15:12.935
you are not properly dressed up

15:13.095 --> 15:16.471
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

15:16.631 --> 15:19.737
that they expect every other person to be.

15:19.897 --> 15:22.931
It’s a funny thing that in this world

15:23.092 --> 15:26.440
all human beings expect others to be very good.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.917
Everybody should be a hero or something

15:29.077 --> 15:31.768
– what about themselves they never think!

15:31.928 --> 15:35.120
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

15:35.280 --> 15:39.183
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

15:39.343 --> 15:44.800
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

15:44.960 --> 15:49.651
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

15:49.811 --> 15:52.854
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

15:53.014 --> 15:58.472
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

15:58.632 --> 16:04.737
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

16:04.897 --> 16:06.866
as a child does.

16:07.319 --> 16:12.995
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

16:13.155 --> 16:17.347
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

16:17.507 --> 16:23.276
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

16:23.436 --> 16:27.823
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

16:27.983 --> 16:36.428
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

16:36.936 --> 16:42.339
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

16:42.499 --> 16:46.483
the whole world get worried about it,

16:46.741 --> 16:50.581
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

16:50.741 --> 16:56.917
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

16:57.077 --> 17:01.065
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

17:01.225 --> 17:05.308
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

17:05.468 --> 17:11.214
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

17:11.374 --> 17:15.808
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

17:15.968 --> 17:20.335
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

17:20.850 --> 17:29.112
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

17:29.272 --> 17:31.631
but just spontaneously.

17:32.499 --> 17:39.714
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

17:39.874 --> 17:43.612
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.612
You can’t run away from the society.

17:46.772 --> 17:54.663
You start getting all the rapport with such people

17:55.022 --> 17:59.410
who are talking about things

17:59.570 --> 18:03.565
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

18:03.725 --> 18:07.733
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

18:09.186 --> 18:12.972
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

18:13.132 --> 18:18.976
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

18:20.858 --> 18:27.745
In the sense that – when I was in London

18:27.905 --> 18:32.339
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

18:32.499 --> 18:36.339
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

18:36.499 --> 18:38.467
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

18:38.628 --> 18:42.222
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

18:42.382 --> 18:45.347
all the married women have to wear this.

18:45.507 --> 18:50.831
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

18:50.991 --> 18:52.573
So I said that,

18:52.733 --> 18:57.089
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

18:57.249 --> 19:00.542
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

19:00.702 --> 19:06.952
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

19:07.975 --> 19:12.886
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

19:13.046 --> 19:18.151
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

19:18.311 --> 19:22.850
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

19:23.397 --> 19:26.659
For the innocence, I think

19:26.819 --> 19:31.889
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

19:34.045 --> 19:38.175
And that’s how it is a society, today,

19:38.335 --> 19:44.620
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.636
Every individual is separate,

19:46.796 --> 19:51.050
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

19:51.210 --> 19:57.417
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

19:57.577 --> 20:01.831
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

20:01.991 --> 20:05.276
or greed behind the whole thing.

20:05.436 --> 20:10.933
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

20:11.093 --> 20:16.472
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

20:16.632 --> 20:19.987
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

20:20.147 --> 20:24.991
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

20:26.108 --> 20:30.979
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

20:31.139 --> 20:34.464
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

20:34.624 --> 20:37.354
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

20:37.514 --> 20:39.198
“What will they misunderstand?”

20:39.358 --> 20:43.425
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

20:43.585 --> 20:46.261
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

20:46.421 --> 20:49.987
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

20:50.147 --> 20:54.526
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

20:54.686 --> 20:59.425
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

20:59.585 --> 21:01.987
But then I noticed it’s too much

21:02.147 --> 21:06.050
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

21:06.210 --> 21:09.198
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

21:09.358 --> 21:13.018
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

21:13.178 --> 21:16.487
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

21:16.647 --> 21:26.159
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

21:26.319 --> 21:33.702
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

21:33.952 --> 21:38.854
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

21:39.014 --> 21:41.081
I just can’t understand how they accept.

21:41.241 --> 21:46.811
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

21:47.444 --> 21:51.831
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

21:51.991 --> 21:55.487
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

21:55.647 --> 22:00.245
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

22:00.405 --> 22:06.073
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

22:06.233 --> 22:11.503
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

22:11.663 --> 22:16.733
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

22:18.709 --> 22:21.657
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

22:21.817 --> 22:23.986
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

22:24.146 --> 22:27.440
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

22:27.600 --> 22:31.886
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

22:32.046 --> 22:35.076
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

22:35.236 --> 22:39.951
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

22:40.403 --> 22:45.577
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

22:45.737 --> 22:49.745
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

22:49.905 --> 22:57.998
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

22:58.158 --> 23:02.065
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

23:02.225 --> 23:08.078
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

23:08.238 --> 23:12.042
but every time you see something you find

23:12.202 --> 23:16.706
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

23:16.866 --> 23:20.433
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

23:20.593 --> 23:27.741
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

23:28.991 --> 23:34.019
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

23:34.179 --> 23:36.183
I don’t understand.

23:36.343 --> 23:40.425
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

23:40.585 --> 23:43.870
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

23:44.030 --> 23:46.050
“So what? What’s wrong?”

23:46.210 --> 23:49.995
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

23:50.155 --> 23:53.800
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

23:53.960 --> 23:59.229
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

23:59.389 --> 24:04.315
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

24:04.475 --> 24:10.620
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

24:10.780 --> 24:15.581
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

24:15.741 --> 24:21.179
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

24:22.334 --> 24:23.839
you should be very careful,

24:23.999 --> 24:26.775
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

24:26.935 --> 24:31.085
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

24:32.561 --> 24:41.128
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

24:41.288 --> 24:47.515
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

24:50.046 --> 24:54.308
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

24:54.468 --> 25:01.702
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

25:02.780 --> 25:07.854
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

25:08.014 --> 25:11.940
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

25:12.100 --> 25:16.464
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

25:16.624 --> 25:21.362
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

25:21.522 --> 25:26.518
how He has made their attention so beautiful

25:26.678 --> 25:30.854
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

25:31.014 --> 25:34.350
all the innocent things of the world.”

25:34.686 --> 25:39.409
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

25:39.569 --> 25:42.769
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

25:42.929 --> 25:44.495
There are many who are struggling

25:44.655 --> 25:49.972
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

25:50.132 --> 25:54.021
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

25:54.180 --> 25:57.728
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

25:57.889 --> 26:01.175
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

26:01.335 --> 26:05.913
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

26:07.647 --> 26:11.808
That shows that there are so many people still

26:11.968 --> 26:17.503
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

26:17.663 --> 26:19.262
and they want to enjoy it.

26:19.422 --> 26:22.761
But a society has to be created of that kind.

26:22.921 --> 26:28.151
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

26:28.311 --> 26:35.522
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

26:35.944 --> 26:38.739
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

26:38.899 --> 26:41.806
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

26:41.966 --> 26:46.894
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

26:47.054 --> 26:50.835
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

26:51.343 --> 26:55.620
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

26:55.780 --> 27:00.339
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

27:00.499 --> 27:04.214
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

27:04.374 --> 27:10.933
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

27:11.093 --> 27:14.753
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

27:14.913 --> 27:17.125
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

27:17.285 --> 27:20.370
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

27:20.530 --> 27:22.886
And one of them then turned around and said,

27:23.046 --> 27:26.487
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

27:26.647 --> 27:28.729
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

27:28.889 --> 27:31.558
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

27:31.718 --> 27:36.847
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

27:37.007 --> 27:40.683
you have to project now, to project towards others.

27:40.843 --> 27:44.581
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

27:44.741 --> 27:47.573
just with one glance you can put that person right,

27:47.733 --> 27:53.073
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

27:53.233 --> 27:56.374
In a way that’s a projection.

27:57.249 --> 28:01.261
Around your society, around where you are working,

28:01.421 --> 28:06.565
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

28:06.725 --> 28:09.894
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

28:10.054 --> 28:15.729
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

28:15.889 --> 28:19.573
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

28:19.733 --> 28:23.729
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

28:23.889 --> 28:26.995
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

28:27.155 --> 28:30.940
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

28:31.100 --> 28:35.456
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

28:35.616 --> 28:39.222
You have those qualities within you

28:39.382 --> 28:42.698
because potentially you had them before

28:42.858 --> 28:47.097
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

28:47.257 --> 28:51.226
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

28:52.804 --> 28:58.620
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

28:58.780 --> 29:02.870
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

29:03.030 --> 29:07.690
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

29:07.850 --> 29:11.425
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

29:11.585 --> 29:15.261
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

29:15.421 --> 29:21.245
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

29:21.405 --> 29:25.026
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

29:25.186 --> 29:30.222
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

29:30.382 --> 29:33.851
It is not a coincidence we should say.

29:34.725 --> 29:39.776
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

29:39.936 --> 29:43.362
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

29:43.522 --> 29:47.065
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

29:47.225 --> 29:50.329
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

29:50.489 --> 29:54.069
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

29:55.155 --> 29:58.221
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.683
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

30:00.843 --> 30:03.984
He put them under the seat and did all that.

30:05.210 --> 30:10.979
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

30:11.139 --> 30:14.912
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

30:16.389 --> 30:20.370
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

30:20.530 --> 30:23.094
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

30:23.254 --> 30:27.964
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

30:28.124 --> 30:30.979
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

30:31.139 --> 30:33.425
You see, it is the power that you have.

30:33.585 --> 30:38.405
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

30:38.702 --> 30:45.975
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

30:46.241 --> 30:49.913
You see, how children understand love.

30:50.248 --> 30:55.826
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

30:55.986 --> 31:01.764
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

31:02.241 --> 31:07.003
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

31:07.163 --> 31:11.714
and they were very troublesome to begin with

31:11.874 --> 31:14.661
and the parents were worried about them.

31:14.821 --> 31:17.163
They sent them to Dharamsala

31:18.124 --> 31:22.198
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

31:22.358 --> 31:25.870
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

31:26.030 --> 31:30.581
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

31:30.741 --> 31:33.558
they came back and the parents asked them,

31:33.718 --> 31:36.496
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

31:36.656 --> 31:39.646
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

31:39.806 --> 31:42.667
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

31:42.827 --> 31:48.710
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

31:49.991 --> 31:52.708
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

31:52.868 --> 31:57.573
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

31:57.733 --> 32:01.104
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

32:01.264 --> 32:02.472
We are not bothered.”

32:02.632 --> 32:05.511
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

32:05.671 --> 32:07.933
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.644
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

32:10.804 --> 32:14.683
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

32:14.843 --> 32:18.808
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

32:18.968 --> 32:22.801
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

32:22.961 --> 32:28.109
Very much satisfied, dignified.

32:29.046 --> 32:33.496
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

32:33.656 --> 32:36.417
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

32:36.577 --> 32:39.319
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

32:39.479 --> 32:42.102
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

32:42.262 --> 32:46.831
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

32:46.991 --> 32:50.468
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

32:50.976 --> 32:53.378
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

32:53.538 --> 32:57.160
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

32:57.320 --> 33:05.130
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

33:05.913 --> 33:08.839
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

33:08.999 --> 33:11.199
but I have not been with them for a long time,

33:11.359 --> 33:13.709
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

33:13.869 --> 33:18.187
but look at the love that they have.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.699
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

33:21.859 --> 33:24.777
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

33:24.937 --> 33:26.988
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

33:27.148 --> 33:30.230
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

33:30.390 --> 33:34.800
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

33:34.960 --> 33:41.574
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

33:41.734 --> 33:47.871
and so much they admire, they want it.

33:48.031 --> 33:53.956
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

33:54.116 --> 33:58.934
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

33:59.094 --> 34:03.061
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

34:03.221 --> 34:06.550
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

34:06.710 --> 34:10.714
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

34:10.874 --> 34:12.563
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

34:12.723 --> 34:15.535
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

34:15.695 --> 34:21.406
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

34:22.812 --> 34:25.792
and we enjoyed all that very much.

34:25.952 --> 34:32.468
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

34:33.967 --> 34:39.433
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

34:39.593 --> 34:44.445
creating something sweet of this kind.

34:44.656 --> 34:49.550
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

34:49.710 --> 34:56.722
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

34:56.882 --> 35:01.660
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

35:01.820 --> 35:05.245
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

35:05.405 --> 35:08.449
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

35:08.609 --> 35:11.167
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

35:11.327 --> 35:15.456
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

35:15.616 --> 35:20.480
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

35:20.640 --> 35:25.035
so they got equipped from within.

35:25.195 --> 35:29.761
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

35:29.921 --> 35:33.644
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

35:33.804 --> 35:41.128
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

35:41.288 --> 35:44.058
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

35:44.218 --> 35:47.308
also know that we have to give it to others.

35:47.468 --> 35:51.831
We have to pour this into others.

35:51.991 --> 35:55.316
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

35:55.476 --> 35:59.269
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

35:59.429 --> 36:04.597
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

36:04.757 --> 36:09.542
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

36:09.702 --> 36:13.808
And Shiva had to cut His head

36:13.968 --> 36:18.456
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

36:18.616 --> 36:24.478
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

36:24.638 --> 36:28.660
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

36:28.820 --> 36:33.269
because in innocence you become a person

36:33.429 --> 36:36.839
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

36:36.999 --> 36:41.137
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

36:41.297 --> 36:46.906
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

36:47.710 --> 36:53.519
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.089
There was a king in China.

36:55.249 --> 36:58.910
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

36:59.070 --> 37:09.410
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

37:09.570 --> 37:13.843
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

37:14.429 --> 37:17.800
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

37:17.960 --> 37:22.933
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

37:23.093 --> 37:25.035
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

37:25.195 --> 37:31.074
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

37:31.234 --> 37:35.826
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

37:35.986 --> 37:38.662
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

37:38.822 --> 37:42.662
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

37:42.822 --> 37:46.396
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

37:46.556 --> 37:54.501
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

37:54.837 --> 37:57.939
So all the cocks were together.

37:58.486 --> 38:02.685
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

38:02.845 --> 38:06.068
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

38:06.228 --> 38:09.298
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

38:09.458 --> 38:11.560
he was just standing straight.

38:11.720 --> 38:16.224
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

38:16.384 --> 38:21.545
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

38:21.705 --> 38:25.873
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

38:26.033 --> 38:29.552
where they were having these fights.

38:29.712 --> 38:34.025
And this was the only cock which stood up.

38:34.197 --> 38:39.888
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

38:40.048 --> 38:44.560
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

38:44.720 --> 38:48.926
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

38:49.087 --> 38:52.311
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

38:52.471 --> 38:56.771
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

38:56.931 --> 39:01.513
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

39:01.673 --> 39:07.275
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

39:07.435 --> 39:16.869
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

39:17.029 --> 39:20.092
if you take to your innocence.

39:20.521 --> 39:25.416
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

39:25.576 --> 39:30.959
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

39:31.404 --> 39:34.923
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

39:35.083 --> 39:37.322
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

39:37.482 --> 39:40.181
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

39:40.341 --> 39:42.455
It rained so much so that they said,

39:42.615 --> 39:47.509
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

39:47.669 --> 39:49.906
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

39:50.066 --> 39:55.540
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

39:55.700 --> 40:01.740
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

40:02.271 --> 40:09.267
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

40:09.427 --> 40:14.560
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

40:14.802 --> 40:18.572
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

40:18.732 --> 40:24.095
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

40:24.255 --> 40:30.178
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

40:30.338 --> 40:35.422
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

40:35.582 --> 40:40.470
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

40:40.630 --> 40:54.225
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

40:54.385 --> 40:56.719
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

40:56.879 --> 41:01.876
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

41:02.036 --> 41:08.619
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

41:09.684 --> 41:14.890
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

41:15.050 --> 41:18.632
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

41:18.792 --> 41:22.429
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

41:22.589 --> 41:27.421
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

41:27.581 --> 41:31.905
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

41:32.065 --> 41:37.179
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

41:37.339 --> 41:40.468
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

41:40.628 --> 41:45.077
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

41:45.237 --> 41:52.784
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.536
How He guides you and how He helps you.

41:56.696 --> 41:58.941
How He takes you to [the] right path.

41:59.101 --> 42:01.550
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

42:01.710 --> 42:06.925
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

42:07.085 --> 42:11.519
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

42:11.679 --> 42:16.644
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

42:16.804 --> 42:21.011
He takes you to the righteous road.

42:21.171 --> 42:25.206
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

42:25.366 --> 42:27.917
You always meet friends here and there.

42:28.077 --> 42:30.331
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

42:30.491 --> 42:32.933
And that is how He works.

42:33.093 --> 42:42.667
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

42:42.827 --> 42:45.308
because you are His ganas.

42:45.468 --> 42:48.351
But the ganas have to work!

42:49.694 --> 42:55.092
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

42:55.279 --> 43:03.737
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

43:03.897 --> 43:09.847
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

43:10.007 --> 43:12.917
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

43:13.077 --> 43:16.378
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

43:16.538 --> 43:19.452
He gives you all the good time.

43:20.397 --> 43:22.816
Then what are we doing about it?

43:22.976 --> 43:28.144
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

43:28.304 --> 43:31.906
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

43:32.468 --> 43:36.331
What can we do as antibodies?

43:36.491 --> 43:48.243
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

43:48.845 --> 43:55.266
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

43:55.453 --> 44:01.888
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

44:02.048 --> 44:04.474
You may melt away many people.

44:04.634 --> 44:11.646
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

44:11.806 --> 44:16.458
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

44:16.618 --> 44:20.214
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

44:20.375 --> 44:25.073
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

44:25.234 --> 44:27.932
Because you are so powerful.

44:28.093 --> 44:31.184
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

44:31.345 --> 44:36.622
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

44:36.782 --> 44:40.052
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

44:40.212 --> 44:44.216
And all that works out so well.

44:44.376 --> 44:47.896
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

44:48.056 --> 44:53.912
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

44:54.072 --> 44:57.095
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

44:57.352 --> 45:02.240
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

45:02.400 --> 45:05.400
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

45:06.751 --> 45:10.201
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

45:10.361 --> 45:14.025
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

45:14.767 --> 45:18.654
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

45:18.814 --> 45:22.193
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

45:22.353 --> 45:24.990
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

45:25.150 --> 45:29.865
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

45:30.025 --> 45:35.229
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

45:36.533 --> 45:39.537
But you are not to feel any strain.

45:39.697 --> 45:43.943
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

45:44.103 --> 45:46.873
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

45:47.033 --> 45:49.318
– confidence and faith in yourself.

45:49.478 --> 45:54.435
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

45:54.595 --> 45:58.329
which is nothing but compassion and love.

45:59.532 --> 46:01.412
If you have that faith

46:01.572 --> 46:06.908
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

46:08.446 --> 46:16.486
of having [a] relationship with others.

46:18.150 --> 46:25.634
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

46:26.704 --> 46:30.165
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

46:31.337 --> 46:35.029
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

46:35.189 --> 46:38.412
I have never got into a fury or a temper

46:38.572 --> 46:40.755
because I think I can manage without it.

46:40.915 --> 46:44.779
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

46:44.939 --> 46:49.857
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

46:50.017 --> 46:54.443
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

46:54.603 --> 46:57.365
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

46:57.525 --> 47:00.708
it is such an energy-giving thing,

47:00.868 --> 47:10.368
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

47:11.821 --> 47:14.396
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

47:14.556 --> 47:20.646
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

47:20.806 --> 47:25.427
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

47:25.587 --> 47:29.513
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

47:29.673 --> 47:31.540
that you can’t leave.

47:32.197 --> 47:37.787
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

47:37.947 --> 47:39.970
they don’t know how the child is lost.

47:40.130 --> 47:46.405
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

47:46.565 --> 47:51.841
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

47:52.001 --> 47:54.693
But when they are young, they are innocent

47:54.853 --> 47:59.341
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

47:59.501 --> 48:04.880
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

48:05.040 --> 48:09.060
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

48:09.220 --> 48:15.700
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

48:15.860 --> 48:20.278
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

48:20.438 --> 48:24.107
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

48:24.267 --> 48:30.232
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

48:30.392 --> 48:33.427
that your children are looked after.

48:33.587 --> 48:36.802
But you are also a child of your Mother.

48:36.962 --> 48:41.318
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

48:41.478 --> 48:47.708
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

48:47.868 --> 48:51.310
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

48:51.470 --> 48:56.271
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

48:56.431 --> 48:58.294
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

48:58.454 --> 49:01.810
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

49:01.970 --> 49:03.825
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

49:03.986 --> 49:07.469
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

49:07.630 --> 49:16.032
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

49:16.954 --> 49:20.943
Today is to celebrate His birth

49:21.103 --> 49:26.529
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

49:26.689 --> 49:32.556
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

49:33.212 --> 49:37.990
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

49:38.150 --> 49:44.619
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

49:45.267 --> 49:48.533
And that’s why He was first created.

49:49.283 --> 49:54.396
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

49:54.556 --> 49:57.947
so that He can look after all the people

49:58.361 --> 50:05.986
who are going to come from ages to ages,

50:06.408 --> 50:10.971
to guide them always on the right path.

50:11.157 --> 50:15.912
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

50:16.072 --> 50:20.240
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

50:20.400 --> 50:22.951
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

50:23.111 --> 50:25.060
That I should have not done.”

50:25.220 --> 50:30.552
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

50:30.712 --> 50:33.896
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

50:34.056 --> 50:37.388
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

50:37.548 --> 50:41.318
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

50:41.478 --> 50:45.177
“Why did you give up your land?”

50:45.337 --> 50:49.388
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

50:49.548 --> 50:53.870
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

50:54.030 --> 50:58.053
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

50:58.213 --> 51:00.130
So I thought it’s better to give up.

51:00.290 --> 51:02.701
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

51:02.861 --> 51:07.056
And he so innocently was telling me that,

51:07.493 --> 51:13.263
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

51:13.423 --> 51:16.365
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

51:16.525 --> 51:20.763
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

51:20.923 --> 51:22.769
But I said, “What about your brother?”

51:22.930 --> 51:26.415
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

51:26.575 --> 51:29.505
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

51:29.665 --> 51:33.888
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

51:34.048 --> 51:37.044
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

51:37.204 --> 51:39.873
Later on I might become a bad man.”

51:40.033 --> 51:43.684
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

51:43.844 --> 51:46.396
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

51:46.556 --> 51:51.114
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

51:51.274 --> 51:55.623
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

51:55.783 --> 51:57.201
I don’t know what to do.

51:57.361 --> 52:00.537
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

52:00.697 --> 52:06.510
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

52:07.103 --> 52:09.974
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

52:10.134 --> 52:14.138
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

52:14.298 --> 52:18.443
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

52:18.603 --> 52:24.458
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

52:24.618 --> 52:28.154
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

52:28.314 --> 52:32.521
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

52:32.681 --> 52:35.365
So he can save me from the smoking.”

52:35.525 --> 52:39.888
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

52:40.048 --> 52:42.763
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

52:42.923 --> 52:46.318
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

52:46.478 --> 52:50.974
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

52:51.134 --> 52:55.599
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

52:55.759 --> 53:00.216
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

53:00.376 --> 53:04.473
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

53:04.633 --> 53:09.861
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

53:10.423 --> 53:15.404
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

53:15.564 --> 53:20.193
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

53:20.353 --> 53:25.826
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

53:25.986 --> 53:31.544
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

53:31.704 --> 53:35.365
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

53:35.525 --> 53:38.513
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

53:38.673 --> 53:43.029
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

53:43.189 --> 53:47.490
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

53:47.650 --> 53:50.474
For example, I have never seen such honest people

53:50.634 --> 53:54.294
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

53:54.454 --> 53:58.076
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

53:58.236 --> 54:01.107
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

54:01.267 --> 54:04.029
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

54:04.189 --> 54:07.779
but most of you have become so honest.

54:07.939 --> 54:10.638
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

54:10.798 --> 54:14.650
and to see people who are so honest.

54:15.055 --> 54:18.596
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

54:18.756 --> 54:23.474
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

54:23.634 --> 54:29.431
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

54:29.641 --> 54:35.255
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

54:35.415 --> 54:39.821
how you people are so much fond of me.

54:41.414 --> 54:51.404
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

54:51.564 --> 54:54.607
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

54:54.767 --> 54:58.138
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

54:58.298 --> 55:00.294
Because He’s so attached to me

55:00.454 --> 55:04.201
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

55:04.361 --> 55:06.123
That’s what you are.

55:06.283 --> 55:08.466
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

55:08.626 --> 55:12.482
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

55:12.642 --> 55:17.333
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

55:17.493 --> 55:24.099
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

55:24.259 --> 55:27.208
But the another quality, as I said, is that

55:27.368 --> 55:32.130
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

55:32.290 --> 55:37.857
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

55:38.017 --> 55:44.654
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

55:44.814 --> 55:52.208
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

55:52.368 --> 55:55.683
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

55:55.843 --> 55:59.373
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

55:59.533 --> 56:04.787
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

56:04.947 --> 56:09.982
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

56:10.142 --> 56:12.388
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

56:12.548 --> 56:16.279
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

56:16.439 --> 56:22.177
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

56:22.337 --> 56:26.224
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

56:26.384 --> 56:28.505
Nobody makes a mistake.”

56:28.665 --> 56:32.068
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

56:32.228 --> 56:36.560
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

56:36.720 --> 56:40.720
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

56:40.881 --> 56:44.998
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

56:45.158 --> 56:50.154
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

56:50.314 --> 56:54.193
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

56:54.353 --> 56:58.779
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

56:58.939 --> 57:06.482
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

57:06.642 --> 57:17.970
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

57:18.736 --> 57:23.208
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

57:23.368 --> 57:28.068
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

57:28.228 --> 57:31.779
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

57:31.939 --> 57:34.364
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

57:34.524 --> 57:37.833
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

57:37.993 --> 57:44.740
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

57:44.900 --> 57:50.646
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

57:50.806 --> 57:58.287
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

57:58.447 --> 58:03.193
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

58:03.353 --> 58:10.927
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

58:11.087 --> 58:17.638
with such speed and with such lightness:

58:17.798 --> 58:20.224
they were lifting their legs and hand.

58:20.384 --> 58:25.759
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

58:26.868 --> 58:31.966
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

58:32.126 --> 58:36.044
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

58:36.204 --> 58:39.958
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

58:40.118 --> 58:42.833
They earn their living, they are farmers,

58:42.993 --> 58:47.943
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

58:48.103 --> 58:51.896
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

58:52.056 --> 59:00.255
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

59:00.415 --> 59:03.537
or another bad things that people think

59:03.697 --> 59:07.141
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

59:07.301 --> 59:10.387
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

59:10.547 --> 59:16.130
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

59:16.290 --> 59:18.271
in a very beautiful manner.

59:18.431 --> 59:24.318
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

59:24.478 --> 59:27.662
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

59:27.822 --> 59:33.662
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

59:33.822 --> 59:39.966
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

59:40.126 --> 59:45.318
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

59:45.478 --> 59:48.052
and think of violence and killing people?

59:48.212 --> 59:50.849
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

59:51.009 --> 59:54.857
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

59:55.017 --> 59:59.873
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

01:00:00.033 --> 01:00:06.365
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

01:00:06.525 --> 01:00:10.599
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

01:00:10.759 --> 01:00:16.513
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

01:00:16.673 --> 01:00:18.794
There is no need for us to fight.

01:00:18.954 --> 01:00:23.349
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

01:00:23.509 --> 01:00:27.130
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.310
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:33.021
He’ll either become a transformed person

01:00:33.181 --> 01:00:37.197
or he will not be there to trouble you.

01:00:38.032 --> 01:00:43.154
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

01:00:43.314 --> 01:00:45.556
and our powers.

01:00:47.025 --> 01:00:51.357
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

01:00:51.517 --> 01:00:56.540
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

01:00:57.181 --> 01:01:01.435
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

01:01:01.595 --> 01:01:05.095
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

01:01:05.368 --> 01:01:06.883
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

01:01:07.044 --> 01:01:10.246
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

01:01:10.407 --> 01:01:12.466
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

01:01:12.626 --> 01:01:15.474
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:20.865
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:26.794
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:29.302
You can do it, everything. You can.

01:01:29.462 --> 01:01:33.693
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

01:01:33.853 --> 01:01:38.537
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

01:01:38.697 --> 01:01:40.888
you are not going to spoil anybody,

01:01:41.048 --> 01:01:45.919
but your power itself will show that this power

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:54.474
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

01:01:54.634 --> 01:01:57.669
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

01:01:57.829 --> 01:02:03.595
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

01:02:03.797 --> 01:02:09.185
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

01:02:09.345 --> 01:02:16.845
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

01:02:17.626 --> 01:02:23.302
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

01:02:23.462 --> 01:02:27.333
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:30.568
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

01:02:30.728 --> 01:02:34.623
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

01:02:34.783 --> 01:02:38.396
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

01:02:38.556 --> 01:02:41.458
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

01:02:41.618 --> 01:02:44.164
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:47.497
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

01:02:47.658 --> 01:02:50.748
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

01:02:50.908 --> 01:02:54.474
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

01:02:54.634 --> 01:02:56.677
and they are sitting there and fighting,

01:02:56.837 --> 01:03:00.513
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

01:03:00.673 --> 01:03:04.817
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

01:03:04.977 --> 01:03:07.990
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:09.724
So there were four tiers.

01:03:09.884 --> 01:03:13.724
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

01:03:13.884 --> 01:03:16.083
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

01:03:16.243 --> 01:03:21.188
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:25.693
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

01:03:25.853 --> 01:03:33.681
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

01:03:34.547 --> 01:03:40.451
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

01:03:40.611 --> 01:03:45.884
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

01:03:46.688 --> 01:03:49.162
He’s the one who worked it out.

01:03:49.322 --> 01:03:50.724
That’s why they say always,

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:54.638
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:57.599
because then it gives you that peace,

01:03:57.759 --> 01:04:03.310
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:06.603
that you never thought it would.

01:04:09.618 --> 01:04:14.216
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

01:04:14.376 --> 01:04:19.138
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

01:04:19.298 --> 01:04:22.302
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

01:04:22.462 --> 01:04:24.677
We are still hoping to get the land

01:04:24.837 --> 01:04:28.084
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

01:04:28.244 --> 01:04:30.818
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

01:04:30.978 --> 01:04:35.099
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

01:04:35.259 --> 01:04:39.200
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:45.345
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

01:04:46.212 --> 01:04:49.919
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:53.279
But all that has worked out so well and now

01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:57.154
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

01:04:57.314 --> 01:04:59.393
May God Bless you.
