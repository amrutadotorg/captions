00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.161
1991-0410 Virata Puja, Melbourne, Australia

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:08.905
Because of distances and

00:04:09.034 --> 00:04:12.714
also that we have no ashram  in Melbourne all these days;

00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:17.434
I've found that the collectivity is no yet

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:19.794
properly woven here.

00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:22.234
So I think that the best thing is today

00:04:22.354 --> 00:04:26.274
we must worship the Virata.

00:04:26.394 --> 00:04:31.114
Virata is the primordial father, you can say,

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:37.194
or the one who is in our brain acts

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:39.514
for our collectivity.

00:04:50.994 --> 00:04:55.754
As the Kundalini rises ultimately she ends up

00:04:56.914 --> 00:05:00.754
by piercing through the fontanel bone area.

00:05:00.994 --> 00:05:03.794
Before entering into that

00:05:04.714 --> 00:05:09.274
she enters into the Sahasrara.

00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:12.474
Sahasrara is the area

00:05:12.594 --> 00:05:15.274
which is surrounded by

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:17.554
one thousand nerves

00:05:17.674 --> 00:05:20.834
and in the medical terms

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:23.834
it is called as limbic area.

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:28.714
Now one thousand nerves

00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:32.594
are all connected

00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:38.434
to the sixteen important nerves of the Vishuddhi.

00:05:38.794 --> 00:05:41.154
That's why they say that Shri Krishna had

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:44.394
sixteen thousand wives, that is,

00:05:44.514 --> 00:05:48.434
He had all His powers as His wives

00:05:48.554 --> 00:05:52.834
and I have all My powers as My children.

00:05:57.994 --> 00:06:01.754
So when we are growing in our ascent,

00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:03.874
in our dhyana,

00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:09.754
we have to go to our Sahasrara.

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:18.394
If the Sahasrara was not opened out,

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:23.474
we could not have done this en masse realization.

00:06:23.794 --> 00:06:25.474
How it is connected,

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:28.274
the collectivity is so connected

00:06:28.394 --> 00:06:32.834
with the present-day Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:35.474 --> 00:06:40.034
Before that it was just

00:06:41.594 --> 00:06:44.274
up to the Agnya chakra

00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:49.634
but when it reaches the Sahasrara

00:06:49.754 --> 00:06:52.994
it enlightens all the nerves,

00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:56.754
and all the nerves look like

00:06:56.874 --> 00:07:00.074
flames which are very silent,

00:07:00.194 --> 00:07:03.954
beautifully colored in all vigor colors.

00:07:04.074 --> 00:07:05.954
The

00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:11.154
appearance of these is so soothing and so beautiful

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:15.754
that there's no better view in the whole world, I think,

00:07:15.874 --> 00:07:18.994
that human beings can see.

00:07:19.554 --> 00:07:23.274
So when this Sahasrara was opened out,

00:07:23.394 --> 00:07:26.434
which we are having now a puja as you know,

00:07:26.554 --> 00:07:29.634
in Rome

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:34.354
before that it had to go to the collective,

00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:38.194
that is, I had to pay My attention to the collective.

00:07:38.314 --> 00:07:41.074
I had to see the people,

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:44.314
their different problems,

00:07:44.434 --> 00:07:47.714
the permutations and combinations

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:51.434
by which they are all suffering.

00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:57.594
They can all be brought to the seven major

00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:01.474
notes, we can say,

00:08:01.594 --> 00:08:07.114
but they are also divided into twenty-one -

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:10.754
one on the left, one on the right and one in the center.

00:08:10.874 --> 00:08:13.394
So we have also gather twenty-one

00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:16.114
really basic problems,

00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:18.234
fundamental problems within us

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:20.514
which we have to solve.

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:22.754
We have, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:22.874 --> 00:08:26.354
I tried only to cure people of their physical problems,

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:30.194
mental problems, their family problems, financial problems,

00:08:30.314 --> 00:08:34.554
all kinds of problems have been solved

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:36.874
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:40.634
and we have had some very great mishaps in between.

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.754
As you know that when they came up to the Agnya

00:08:43.874 --> 00:08:46.954
they started taking over

00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:49.594
the whole atmosphere

00:08:49.714 --> 00:08:52.634
by some sort of a authority

00:08:52.754 --> 00:08:55.674
which was not God's authority.

00:08:55.794 --> 00:09:00.994
As a result, many people went out at the Agnya

00:09:01.114 --> 00:09:05.754
but those who have come to Sahasrara have to understand

00:09:05.874 --> 00:09:11.354
that collectivity is the basic of your ascent.

00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:14.074
If you are not collective,

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.754
if you do not come to the center,

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:20.754
if you do not meet each other,

00:09:20.874 --> 00:09:25.634
then you are like a nail which is cut out of the finger and

00:09:26.474 --> 00:09:29.634
the Divine has nothing to do with you - you are out of the tree,

00:09:29.754 --> 00:09:36.234
like the flowers which have come out of the tree

00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:39.354
can exist for a while, no doubt,

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:43.154
but after some time they are dead and finished.

00:09:43.274 --> 00:09:46.474
So it is important for all of you to understand

00:09:46.594 --> 00:09:51.554
that collectivity, if it is not established in Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.314
Sahaja Yoga will die out.

00:09:54.434 --> 00:09:58.634
I am now going to America where collectivity

00:09:58.754 --> 00:10:01.994
has to be really of the maximum nature,

00:10:02.114 --> 00:10:04.354
but it is not so.

00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:08.954
There are so many problems on collectivity in America,

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:12.714
but still I would say that they realize one thing,

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:15.194
that they have to be very collective.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:18.234
The problems are like there are very few people

00:10:18.354 --> 00:10:20.394
who are Sahaja Yogis there,

00:10:20.514 --> 00:10:22.554
but among themselves

00:10:22.674 --> 00:10:26.354
they understand responsibility. They are all working very hard.

00:10:26.474 --> 00:10:28.874
They are spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:32.794
Now you see the have this ''Cool Breeze'' started from there,

00:10:32.914 --> 00:10:36.714
there are so many activities they are doing in America

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:39.594
with such a small number that it is amazing

00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:41.954
how they are managing these things,

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.154
and they do it very beautifully

00:10:44.274 --> 00:10:47.874
because they feel joined together; they are so far away,

00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:51.474
from Honolulu to New York is such a long distance.

00:10:51.594 --> 00:10:54.914
But there's such a lot of understanding,

00:10:55.034 --> 00:10:57.234
such a lot of love

00:10:57.354 --> 00:10:59.714
and sense of responsibility.

00:10:59.834 --> 00:11:03.634
Because they are a small number they feel extremely responsible

00:11:03.754 --> 00:11:06.594
that we have to be absolutely collective

00:11:06.714 --> 00:11:09.594
- no question of having groups.

00:11:09.714 --> 00:11:12.194
Even if somebody makes mistakes or something,

00:11:12.314 --> 00:11:17.114
they never talk about it to anybody else but to Me.

00:11:17.354 --> 00:11:20.274
They never discuss about each other,

00:11:20.394 --> 00:11:22.874
they never talk ill about each other,

00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:25.274
they never form any groups.

00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:29.234
The children are outside. Who are? Just they can came here, there is space.

00:11:29.354 --> 00:11:33.274
Can you have little bit up in there?

00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:38.114
Just make them space in between. Come along!

00:11:55.914 --> 00:12:00.674
Children can sit in the front they don't occupate much space.

00:12:02.914 --> 00:12:06.514
Children can even sit on your laps.

00:12:09.514 --> 00:12:11.114
Can you move?

00:12:11.234 --> 00:12:14.074
You can make a gap in between.

00:12:15.074 --> 00:12:18.714
Now, this is question of collectivity.

00:12:22.834 --> 00:12:25.354
Bring the children up here.

00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:29.314
All the children can come along, they can help me in puja

00:12:29.434 --> 00:12:31.874
they are very good at helping.

00:12:31.994 --> 00:12:32.954
yes.

00:12:45.594 --> 00:12:48.474
Yes, yes, come along.

00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:54.794
Poor children were kept out, can you imagine?

00:13:01.394 --> 00:13:04.234
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:13:09.034 --> 00:13:13.074
Sit down, sit down, here, sit down. Now.

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:18.154
Come along, come along, come here, come here.

00:13:26.674 --> 00:13:30.034
Now, who are outside now?

00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:40.074
See if small children are there.

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:47.234
Come along, come along.

00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:55.594
I think if you could sit little, not with such a big

00:13:55.714 --> 00:13:58.074
assan, little smaller assan

00:13:58.194 --> 00:14:00.714
People can come.

00:14:02.314 --> 00:14:05.674
And I think open a window also is important

00:14:11.634 --> 00:14:13.874
Yes there is some space

00:14:14.114 --> 00:14:16.074
if there are tree cameras,

00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:18.554
then how can't there be space.

00:14:20.714 --> 00:14:23.114
I think you can have one camera in there

00:14:23.234 --> 00:14:25.114
and they can sit inside.

00:14:25.234 --> 00:14:27.354
All right.

00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:35.154
All right.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.024
You all should sit with one

00:14:58.634 --> 00:15:01.474
one knee up like that so there is more space

00:15:01.754 --> 00:15:03.714
just like Babamama is sitting.

00:15:20.914 --> 00:15:23.114
Give it to in Chaaya's lap.

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.154
Don't spread out your self, little bit

00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:40.034
pull your one leg like that on top.

00:16:40.394 --> 00:16:42.874
Yes, one straight one like this

00:16:42.994 --> 00:16:45.274
even easier to sit that way.

00:16:50.714 --> 00:16:52.634
Easier to sit.

00:16:58.234 --> 00:17:01.034
Now this is the sense of collectivity,

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.794
that it's in a small hall - doesn't matter -

00:17:04.914 --> 00:17:07.034
we are all together,

00:17:07.714 --> 00:17:10.674
and how are we going to get all of them inside,

00:17:11.794 --> 00:17:13.674
because you can't enjoy it

00:17:13.794 --> 00:17:17.034
unless and until all of you are together.

00:17:21.914 --> 00:17:24.474
Now, everybody has to keep quiet, all right children

00:17:24.594 --> 00:17:28.194
all of you, otherwise they will ask you again to go out.

00:17:30.394 --> 00:17:34.874
So now, let us see how do we

00:17:37.074 --> 00:17:40.514
miss out on collectivity.

00:17:43.394 --> 00:17:46.354
There's a very practical down-to-earth

00:17:46.714 --> 00:17:48.434
understanding.

00:17:49.594 --> 00:17:54.194
First we must know without collectivity we cannot exist.

00:17:55.754 --> 00:18:01.074
As the body has to be in connection with the brain,

00:18:01.554 --> 00:18:04.034
in the same way without collectivity

00:18:04.154 --> 00:18:06.674
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

00:18:11.034 --> 00:18:12.474
Once you understand that,

00:18:12.594 --> 00:18:15.234
then you have to work it out that collectivity

00:18:15.354 --> 00:18:19.874
is absolutely established within and without.

00:18:21.074 --> 00:18:23.914
It is more within that you have to establish,

00:18:24.034 --> 00:18:25.554
than without.

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:32.274
Whatever you have within is manifested outside.

00:18:33.794 --> 00:18:38.114
Now how do we establish it within ourselves?

00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:43.954
First of all,

00:18:45.314 --> 00:18:49.594
we have to understand

00:18:49.714 --> 00:18:54.154
that now we are the relations of each other.

00:18:55.314 --> 00:18:58.834
Gyaneshwari said, "TechiSoyarikhoti."

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:29.234
So the first thing is that within ourselves

00:19:29.594 --> 00:19:33.954
we have to see introspection, with introspection,

00:19:34.234 --> 00:19:39.114
what are we doing against collectivity in our mind,

00:19:40.114 --> 00:19:42.954
how our mind is working.

00:19:46.154 --> 00:19:47.754
I do not know

00:19:48.314 --> 00:19:51.314
what thing comes first in the human mind

00:19:51.554 --> 00:19:53.874
about another person,

00:19:54.274 --> 00:19:56.234
but the first thing is that

00:19:56.354 --> 00:19:59.354
these are your real relations

00:20:00.674 --> 00:20:06.114
and nobody else are your relations.

00:20:06.714 --> 00:20:09.514
These children are your children

00:20:11.154 --> 00:20:14.114
and these men are your brothers,

00:20:14.234 --> 00:20:16.434
and these ladies are your sisters,

00:20:16.754 --> 00:20:20.354
and we are one big family together.

00:20:23.194 --> 00:20:26.314
We are part and parcel of one body,

00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:31.874
and this hand cannot hit another hand,

00:20:32.074 --> 00:20:35.274
thank God it doesn't think, otherwise as human beings

00:20:35.394 --> 00:20:39.154
they might start thinking against another hand,

00:20:39.314 --> 00:20:40.554
but they don't

00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:45.234
because they are connected to one brain activity.

00:20:47.674 --> 00:20:50.754
So the first thing one has to understand

00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:55.754
that do not try to see the defects of another person,

00:20:56.434 --> 00:21:00.034
but goodness of another person.

00:21:03.434 --> 00:21:06.194
That is really going to help you the most.

00:21:06.314 --> 00:21:08.154
Like in India, you see, I don't know,

00:21:08.274 --> 00:21:14.034
here maybe the same: if you, if they know you,

00:21:14.154 --> 00:21:17.674
supposing, immediately they'll find out,

00:21:17.794 --> 00:21:21.154
now what work can we take out of this person.

00:21:21.274 --> 00:21:23.114
If somebody is a minister's brother,

00:21:23.234 --> 00:21:25.554
immediately they'll approach the minister's brother.

00:21:25.674 --> 00:21:28.034
All right, "Will you do this work for me?"

00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:30.514
Then somebody says, "l am such-and-such .. ."

00:21:30.634 --> 00:21:32.514
immediately people will think,

00:21:32.634 --> 00:21:36.194
"Oh, so what, what work can we get out of this person?"

00:21:37.914 --> 00:21:40.714
In the same way you can go little further

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:42.754
in the language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:42.874 --> 00:21:44.954
As soon as you come to know about someone,

00:21:45.074 --> 00:21:48.794
you should not think what business I can do with him.

00:21:48.914 --> 00:21:51.114
I have seen immediately if somebody has money

00:21:51.234 --> 00:21:54.954
people will jump at him, all right, let's have the business together,

00:21:55.074 --> 00:21:57.314
even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.594
Or if there is anything like that immediately they

00:22:00.714 --> 00:22:03.874
start employing that person for your purpose.

00:22:07.314 --> 00:22:10.434
On the contrary, what you have to do

00:22:10.554 --> 00:22:13.074
as soon as you know about somebody,

00:22:13.394 --> 00:22:17.274
then you have to think what goodness he has got,

00:22:17.394 --> 00:22:21.354
how can I imbibe that goodness within myself?

00:22:22.434 --> 00:22:27.234
Because we are here to enrich ourselves spiritually.

00:22:30.274 --> 00:22:33.314
So you must think as first and foremost thing,

00:22:33.434 --> 00:22:36.794
"What can I do to get

00:22:36.914 --> 00:22:40.714
the goodness of that person within myself?"

00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:43.594
So you'll be looking out

00:22:43.714 --> 00:22:45.394
for the goodness of that person

00:22:45.514 --> 00:22:49.434
than instead of looking out for bad qualities,

00:22:49.754 --> 00:22:53.674
because bad qualities are not going to nourish you at all.

00:22:53.994 --> 00:22:57.274
Also if somebody has bad qualities,

00:22:57.394 --> 00:23:00.274
no use thinking about you yourself

00:23:00.394 --> 00:23:02.634
because if you start thinking about it

00:23:02.754 --> 00:23:05.194
they are not going to be improved,

00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:08.034
it is somebody else's problem.

00:23:08.154 --> 00:23:12.514
The best thing is to look at another person

00:23:12.634 --> 00:23:15.234
with adoration and understanding,

00:23:15.354 --> 00:23:20.154
with love that he is one of us and what can I use?

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:22.434
Now if I have the hand I don't have to think

00:23:22.554 --> 00:23:24.554
because we are programmed that way.

00:23:24.674 --> 00:23:26.714
If I have to hold this, automatically

00:23:26.834 --> 00:23:30.754
I use My hand, not My feet, I know My hands are holding,

00:23:30.874 --> 00:23:34.434
but when I have to walk, I don't walk with My hands

00:23:34.554 --> 00:23:36.754
because I know My feet have to walk.

00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:42.074
In the same way, you have to know which Sahaja Yogi

00:23:42.834 --> 00:23:49.194
is going to help you to nourish yourself.

00:23:49.874 --> 00:23:55.394
Immediately your mind will become very clear.

00:23:56.794 --> 00:23:59.994
Like now I saw some boy in

00:24:01.594 --> 00:24:03.194
New Zealand

00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:07.234
who was really about to be dead,

00:24:08.554 --> 00:24:14.594
and when he came back I found the
attitude towards him was not kind,

00:24:16.914 --> 00:24:18.794
as it should have been,

00:24:19.754 --> 00:24:22.634
but this is the best chance when you should see

00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:26.314
how you can practice your compassion.

00:24:27.834 --> 00:24:29.714
We talk of compassion, compassion.

00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:33.034
Now let us see how we can practice our compassion

00:24:33.154 --> 00:24:35.074
when this boy is so sick.

00:24:35.194 --> 00:24:37.914
On the contrary, everybody was harsh on him,

00:24:38.034 --> 00:24:42.714
they were passing remarks at him, doing things like that.

00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.754
Because we have to have compassion,

00:24:47.874 --> 00:24:50.754
now Mother has said we have to have compassion,

00:24:50.874 --> 00:24:53.034
well now where do we have our compassion, on the walls?

00:24:53.154 --> 00:24:55.314
Where do we use our compassion?

00:24:55.434 --> 00:24:58.034
Where do we use our compassion?

00:24:58.274 --> 00:25:02.194
So Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced, doesn't mean that you sit down

00:25:02.314 --> 00:25:05.994
with My photograph all the time, doesn't mean that.

00:25:06.114 --> 00:25:10.074
It means you practice compassion;

00:25:10.194 --> 00:25:12.754
you practice that.

00:25:15.234 --> 00:25:17.274
Then you have to practice love.

00:25:17.394 --> 00:25:20.354
Now how do you practice love with others?

00:25:20.474 --> 00:25:23.354
If you love someone, what do you do?

00:25:23.474 --> 00:25:25.874
You try to please that person.

00:25:27.314 --> 00:25:30.994
Small things can make people very happy.

00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:33.194
I know, you all try to please Me very much,

00:25:33.314 --> 00:25:34.634
you give Me presents,

00:25:34.754 --> 00:25:36.994
you find out things which are good for Me,

00:25:37.114 --> 00:25:39.994
you go out of the way buy sweet flowers for Me,

00:25:40.114 --> 00:25:42.074
beautiful things you do to please Me.

00:25:42.194 --> 00:25:44.674
I am over-pleased, I must tell you,

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:49.754
but I am more pleased, much more pleased

00:25:49.874 --> 00:25:51.994
if you understand collectivity

00:25:52.114 --> 00:25:55.354
and try to please each other.

00:25:55.474 --> 00:25:58.194
Such a person pleases Me the most

00:25:58.314 --> 00:26:02.994
that the attention is more on pleasing each other.

00:26:05.114 --> 00:26:07.714
As soon as you decide you have to please others,

00:26:07.834 --> 00:26:09.874
your tongue will become different.

00:26:09.994 --> 00:26:12.554
It will become much sweeter.

00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:16.314
The tongue which was like a pair of scissors

00:26:16.434 --> 00:26:19.794
becomes such a beautiful thing of honey.

00:26:20.394 --> 00:26:22.114
Then you talk little but

00:26:22.234 --> 00:26:24.314
you really pour honey on another person,

00:26:24.474 --> 00:26:28.034
so to the another person really enjoys it.

00:26:28.154 --> 00:26:31.794
So now the practice love where do you practice?

00:26:32.074 --> 00:26:34.954
Ask you a question: where do I practice love?

00:26:37.314 --> 00:26:39.394
What do I love?

00:26:39.914 --> 00:26:41.994
We live, love our house,

00:26:42.114 --> 00:26:44.194
we love our photographs,

00:26:44.314 --> 00:26:46.194
our decorations, everything,

00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:49.354
but do I practice this love on my wife,

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:53.474
or on my husband,

00:26:53.874 --> 00:26:56.914
or on other Sahaja Yogis?

00:27:00.194 --> 00:27:01.914
In our Sahaj culture

00:27:02.034 --> 00:27:06.594
we have to practice compassion and love,

00:27:10.274 --> 00:27:13.194
and thirdly we have to practice patience.

00:27:14.714 --> 00:27:17.434
I know some children are maybe

00:27:17.554 --> 00:27:20.914
little more mischievous ... and others less mischievous,

00:27:21.314 --> 00:27:23.754
maybe some people are very talkative,

00:27:23.874 --> 00:27:27.114
sometimes really they give Me also headache;

00:27:27.594 --> 00:27:30.234
they go on talking, talking, talking, talking, so much!

00:27:31.554 --> 00:27:33.274
Sometimes I think it's good

00:27:33.394 --> 00:27:35.714
because it's a rest for My mouth:

00:27:38.074 --> 00:27:39.674
one way of looking at it.

00:27:39.794 --> 00:27:42.754
Another way of looking at it is just switch off your mind,

00:27:42.874 --> 00:27:45.594
let him talk, take it out whatever it was.

00:27:46.914 --> 00:27:49.754
Once he is finished with it and fagged out

00:27:49.874 --> 00:27:53.594
then he won't bother you much

00:27:53.714 --> 00:27:55.394
and also he'll feel satisfied

00:27:55.514 --> 00:27:58.594
that somebody has listened to his prattles.

00:27:59.074 --> 00:28:00.794
So patience is needed

00:28:00.914 --> 00:28:03.394
and patience is needed

00:28:04.154 --> 00:28:08.634
in such a way that others should see your patience.

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:11.474
Yesterday for example, I was sitting for about I think

00:28:11.594 --> 00:28:15.234
three hours shaking hands with all sorts of people

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:18.794
and all types of problems,

00:28:19.314 --> 00:28:22.434
and the person who came last, he said,

00:28:22.554 --> 00:28:26.554
"Looking at Your patience, I develop my own patience."

00:28:29.994 --> 00:28:33.034
And love gives you patience.

00:28:34.114 --> 00:28:37.234
This love nourishes you.

00:28:37.994 --> 00:28:42.754
I'm telling you, it's absolutely down-to-earth method:

00:28:42.874 --> 00:28:45.554
here I've not mentioned that you trust God,

00:28:45.674 --> 00:28:48.074
I am just saying trust yourself.

00:28:48.594 --> 00:28:50.154
Absolutely down-to-earth

00:28:50.274 --> 00:28:53.434
because we are talking about your brain.

00:28:54.354 --> 00:28:56.554
Now we have been saying

00:28:56.674 --> 00:28:59.274
that we have to forgive everyone,

00:28:59.594 --> 00:29:02.114
but we don't practice that.

00:29:02.954 --> 00:29:06.914
Small, small things like mad people we remember,

00:29:07.034 --> 00:29:10.634
that only I have heard that snake has this capacity

00:29:10.754 --> 00:29:13.114
to remember if somebody has hurt him,

00:29:13.234 --> 00:29:16.834
but here I find human beings have no less capacity.

00:29:16.954 --> 00:29:19.074
Whatever has happened 13 years back,

00:29:19.194 --> 00:29:20.834
15 years back, they all remember

00:29:20.954 --> 00:29:23.754
- each and every thing: whatever has hurt them,

00:29:23.874 --> 00:29:27.674
but how they have hurt others they don't remember,

00:29:27.794 --> 00:29:29.594
how they have been nasty to others

00:29:29.714 --> 00:29:31.474
they don't remember,

00:29:31.594 --> 00:29:34.274
because this is a human

00:29:34.434 --> 00:29:36.954
mind which has got the ego

00:29:37.074 --> 00:29:40.674
it can go on hurting others, it doesn't feel anything,

00:29:40.794 --> 00:29:44.234
and the superego which goes on receiving all the hurts

00:29:44.354 --> 00:29:47.954
and always complaining about it.

00:29:51.234 --> 00:29:54.594
So it is for you to realize

00:29:55.634 --> 00:29:58.914
that you are the one who is breaking

00:29:59.034 --> 00:30:02.674
the collectivity.

00:30:03.954 --> 00:30:06.274
First of all, we had horrible leaders here,

00:30:06.394 --> 00:30:09.194
that's how our collectivity was very poor

00:30:09.314 --> 00:30:14.074
but now we are getting soberer people, better people.

00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:18.554
Also for Melbourne I am thinking of getting

00:30:18.674 --> 00:30:21.874
somebody elderly for you to be the leader

00:30:21.994 --> 00:30:27.074
because I think Greg is full with responsibility.

00:30:27.194 --> 00:30:29.274
So, I thought of Henshaw

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:32.034
and I asked him and he has agreed.

00:30:32.154 --> 00:30:34.634
So now in Melbourne we'll have somebody

00:30:34.754 --> 00:30:38.314
staying in the ashram, who is a retired man, who'll look after you,

00:30:38.434 --> 00:30:41.274
will do everything that is possible

00:30:41.394 --> 00:30:45.154
to look after the collectivity of Melbourne.

00:30:47.034 --> 00:30:50.554
But you have to know that

00:30:50.674 --> 00:30:53.794
I have one connection with you

00:30:53.914 --> 00:30:57.754
through your leader.

00:30:59.154 --> 00:31:01.754
That doesn't mean you cannot connect.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:05.114
Like supposing there's a pin

00:31:05.234 --> 00:31:07.914
and you put the pin to Me, immediately My hand will go off

00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:10.434
- means there's a reflex action also,

00:31:10.554 --> 00:31:13.034
but mostly everything is reported to the brain.

00:31:13.154 --> 00:31:17.274
In the same way, everything should be reported to the brain

00:31:17.394 --> 00:31:21.154
but from the very beginning if you develop a kind of

00:31:21.274 --> 00:31:24.914
a criticizing attitude towards your leader,

00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:28.394
then it becomes very difficult

00:31:28.514 --> 00:31:31.314
- for the leader as well as for you.

00:31:31.434 --> 00:31:33.554
First you should not criticize.

00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:35.954
Don't use your brain for criticism,

00:31:36.074 --> 00:31:40.474
already criticism has been too much in the West.

00:31:40.594 --> 00:31:44.634
I mean, now they have got now technique of criticizing.

00:31:45.354 --> 00:31:48.594
All the art is finished because of the critics.

00:31:48.714 --> 00:31:51.274
The artists are afraid to show their paintings,

00:31:51.394 --> 00:31:53.794
artists are afraid to show their creations

00:31:53.914 --> 00:31:55.674
because they will be criticized.

00:31:55.794 --> 00:31:59.914
Now the only thing that is left are critics, critics, critics,

00:32:00.034 --> 00:32:03.954
and the critics are criticizing critics, that's all.

00:32:04.874 --> 00:32:07.874
There is no creativity, nothing.

00:32:07.994 --> 00:32:10.554
So try to appreciate everything.

00:32:10.674 --> 00:32:14.514
Children are producing pictures, paintings anyway.

00:32:15.634 --> 00:32:19.314
They make sometimes My faces very funny

00:32:19.434 --> 00:32:22.274
when they draw - not the children, even grownups.

00:32:22.394 --> 00:32:24.034
Doesn't matter, I appreciate it,

00:32:24.154 --> 00:32:27.034
it's very good, wonderful, very nice,

00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:29.474
to encourage that person.

00:32:29.594 --> 00:32:32.434
So criticism should go out of our mind,

00:32:32.554 --> 00:32:35.994
but appreciation should be practiced:

00:32:37.514 --> 00:32:40.234
appreciation of others' children,

00:32:40.354 --> 00:32:44.914
appreciation of other people is very important

00:32:45.034 --> 00:32:48.394
but that doesn't mean that you appreciate all others

00:32:48.514 --> 00:32:52.274
and torture your wife or torture your husband

00:32:52.394 --> 00:32:54.794
- that also is an imbalance.

00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:58.034
First responsibility is your family

00:32:58.154 --> 00:33:01.114
but you should appreciate others,

00:33:01.234 --> 00:33:05.914
and this comes when you have no jealousies about anyone.

00:33:06.394 --> 00:33:08.754
This jealousy I don't know from where it comes,

00:33:08.874 --> 00:33:13.634
I don't know this quality of jealousy, why there is jealousy.

00:33:14.394 --> 00:33:17.434
So, also if you have jealousy you have to use it

00:33:17.554 --> 00:33:19.834
for the right purpose,

00:33:19.954 --> 00:33:21.554
and what is the right purpose

00:33:21.714 --> 00:33:23.874
is that you should be jealous of a person

00:33:23.994 --> 00:33:26.074
who is spiritually higher than you,

00:33:26.194 --> 00:33:29.554
and you practice it that you become better.

00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:31.834
If jealousy is for competition,

00:33:31.954 --> 00:33:34.074
then you compete with the person

00:33:34.194 --> 00:33:38.994
who is more compassionate, more loving,

00:33:39.114 --> 00:33:42.154
more sacrificing, more patient.

00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:48.834
So this competition becomes a very healthy competition

00:33:48.954 --> 00:33:52.754
and the collectivity becomes very nourished.

00:33:53.914 --> 00:33:58.674
Now try to feel that you are all
part and parcel of one personality.

00:34:00.674 --> 00:34:04.354
Try to understand this and practice this.

00:34:04.474 --> 00:34:07.234
This will help you a lot.

00:34:08.034 --> 00:34:12.754
Little things like buying a little present for someone.

00:34:13.474 --> 00:34:14.874
You see something, "Oh,

00:34:14.994 --> 00:34:18.354
this will be very nice for this person."

00:34:18.994 --> 00:34:21.154
We have officially decided

00:34:21.274 --> 00:34:23.394
that the men should not give presents to women

00:34:23.514 --> 00:34:26.234
and women should not give presents to men,

00:34:26.354 --> 00:34:29.514
but if she is your sister, rakhi sister you can give

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:32.634
and the rakhi sister can give to the brother,

00:34:32.754 --> 00:34:34.554
but otherwise one should not do that.

00:34:34.674 --> 00:34:38.834
We have done it because I have seen it creates problems,

00:34:38.954 --> 00:34:41.674
but that doesn't mean you hate women or hate men.

00:34:41.794 --> 00:34:46.114
But a distance has to be maintained of purity

00:34:47.034 --> 00:34:49.274
till you become completely innocent

00:34:49.394 --> 00:34:52.674
is better is to keep that distance.

00:34:58.034 --> 00:35:00.954
This purity is to be practiced

00:35:02.954 --> 00:35:05.994
and this practice of purity is that

00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:12.154
you try to develop your innocent feelings towards others.

00:35:13.274 --> 00:35:16.194
In innocence everything comes,

00:35:16.834 --> 00:35:19.514
everything comes in innocence.

00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:21.834
If you are innocent

00:35:21.954 --> 00:35:25.874
you will immediately become

00:35:25.994 --> 00:35:28.594
a very good Sahaja Yogi

00:35:28.994 --> 00:35:31.394
but it has so many facets.

00:35:31.514 --> 00:35:34.714
Like the other day there was one girl she was fighting

00:35:34.834 --> 00:35:38.794
for getting some sort of a sweet,

00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:43.754
and they were distributing the prasads.

00:35:43.874 --> 00:35:46.674
So I gave her one of the small plates, I said, "You distribute."

00:35:46.794 --> 00:35:49.114
Immediately she forgot what she wanted,

00:35:49.234 --> 00:35:52.634
she started distributing very sweetly with little, little hands

00:35:52.754 --> 00:35:56.074
the prasad to everyone, very sweet.

00:35:57.634 --> 00:36:00.794
So this has to be practiced from childhood,

00:36:00.914 --> 00:36:03.394
with your children you have to tell them, "Alright,

00:36:03.514 --> 00:36:06.474
let's do these things, distribute this to people,

00:36:06.594 --> 00:36:08.954
go and put kumkum on their heads"

00:36:09.074 --> 00:36:11.314
- they may not do it well, but doesn't matter.

00:36:11.434 --> 00:36:13.634
They will learn how to meet others,

00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:17.194
how to talk to them, how to be with others.

00:36:17.474 --> 00:36:22.634
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is aggressiveness.

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:25.514
Some people are basically aggressive;

00:36:25.634 --> 00:36:28.794
their style of talking is extremely aggressive.

00:36:28.914 --> 00:36:31.594
The way they say things is aggressive,

00:36:31.714 --> 00:36:36.474
maybe because anything, maybe they are better educated,

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:40.554
maybe they come from a very aggressive family,

00:36:40.674 --> 00:36:45.914
maybe they are having a kind of a superiority complex

00:36:46.034 --> 00:36:49.874
or an inferiority complex or a sense of insecurity,

00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:52.994
or maybe they are possessed.

00:36:53.514 --> 00:36:57.554
They try to dominate and show their very strong

00:36:57.674 --> 00:37:04.554
feelings towards people of superiority.

00:37:05.114 --> 00:37:09.954
They may be inferior, it's not necessary, but they do

00:37:10.474 --> 00:37:13.194
and this is something is to be curbed.

00:37:13.674 --> 00:37:18.554
So what you have to practice here is humility:

00:37:18.674 --> 00:37:20.394
try to be humble.

00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:24.434
There was a joke like this, that

00:37:24.554 --> 00:37:27.794
one gentleman was going on the staircase

00:37:27.914 --> 00:37:31.074
and another was coming from the top.

00:37:34.074 --> 00:37:38.154
So this gentleman who was going up there

00:37:39.394 --> 00:37:42.394
said to the other that, "Please move."

00:37:42.514 --> 00:37:45.954
So he said, "l don't move for fools."

00:37:46.074 --> 00:37:48.394
The person who was climbing up, he said,

00:37:48.514 --> 00:37:52.154
"But I do" and he moved out.

00:37:54.234 --> 00:37:56.474
That's how the humility works.

00:37:56.634 --> 00:38:01.634
You have to be humble in your approach to others.

00:38:02.634 --> 00:38:06.274
I mean, English language is outwardly very humble,

00:38:06.394 --> 00:38:09.514
like you must say "please" you must say "thank you" ten times,

00:38:09.634 --> 00:38:12.874
please, please, please, thank you, thank you, thank you,

00:38:12.994 --> 00:38:14.874
but not in the heart.

00:38:14.994 --> 00:38:17.354
Like supposing somebody doesn't say thank you,

00:38:17.474 --> 00:38:19.234
the other person may even beat you.

00:38:19.314 --> 00:38:21.834
"Why didn't you say 'thank you' to me?"

00:38:23.354 --> 00:38:25.194
This is not humility.

00:38:25.834 --> 00:38:31.994
Humility is that in no way you try to aggress others,

00:38:32.114 --> 00:38:34.074
and if others are aggressive

00:38:34.194 --> 00:38:37.074
you accept it as a childish thing,

00:38:37.194 --> 00:38:41.874
as a stupid thing, as a foolish thing, it has no meaning:

00:38:41.994 --> 00:38:45.914
because you are so powerful, you can bear it.

00:38:46.874 --> 00:38:49.874
That is humility which you have to practice

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:53.554
and all these qualities if you have,

00:38:56.154 --> 00:38:58.594
you will really be surprised

00:38:58.714 --> 00:39:01.474
that you will lose your selfishness.

00:39:01.594 --> 00:39:03.994
Your selfishness will start dropping out

00:39:04.114 --> 00:39:09.394
because selfishness how ugly it is

00:39:09.674 --> 00:39:11.674
you start realizing very soon

00:39:12.314 --> 00:39:15.154
when you become generous.

00:39:15.274 --> 00:39:18.714
So you practice your generosity.

00:39:18.914 --> 00:39:21.674
You are all willing to spend lot of money on Me, I know.

00:39:21.794 --> 00:39:24.034
You want to give Me presents - I've stopped it now -

00:39:24.154 --> 00:39:27.114
that individually you cannot give Me any presents or anything,

00:39:27.234 --> 00:39:30.394
but generosity is a general term:

00:39:30.514 --> 00:39:33.514
generosity of kindness,

00:39:33.634 --> 00:39:36.394
generosity of compassion,

00:39:36.514 --> 00:39:39.114
generosity of patience,

00:39:39.234 --> 00:39:42.914
and generosity of material things.

00:39:44.514 --> 00:39:47.034
If I see something, immediately I think,

00:39:47.154 --> 00:39:49.954
"Oh, I should take this because I know l can give it

00:39:50.074 --> 00:39:52.194
to this lady or to this gentleman this thing,

00:39:52.314 --> 00:39:54.674
or I could give it to this purpose

00:39:54.794 --> 00:39:56.354
or for this organization

00:39:56.474 --> 00:39:58.954
or for this kind of a work we are doing."

00:39:59.074 --> 00:40:00.714
Immediately it comes to Me.

00:40:00.834 --> 00:40:05.074
You'd be surprised that if I'm in the market

00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:07.994
and if I'm thirsty, I don't even think

00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:12.714
that I should go and buy some soft drink for Myself

00:40:12.834 --> 00:40:15.074
- doesn't come into mind.

00:40:15.474 --> 00:40:19.674
Even I have never opened My 'fridge in My lifetime,

00:40:19.794 --> 00:40:23.474
but for others I'll run about, I'll cook for them,

00:40:23.594 --> 00:40:26.874
but supposing I'm in the house and there's no cook,

00:40:26.994 --> 00:40:31.514
I'll not cook for Myself - it's all right. If there's nobody in the house,

00:40:31.634 --> 00:40:34.234
if My husband is not there, I will not eat for two/three days

00:40:34.354 --> 00:40:37.194
and then servants, servant will complain to My husband

00:40:37.314 --> 00:40:40.554
then I remember, really, I didn't eat any food? I didn't know.

00:40:40.674 --> 00:40:43.074
If I am eating I am just eating because he is there,

00:40:43.194 --> 00:40:44.874
so I have to eat with him.

00:40:45.434 --> 00:40:47.194
I never used to take tea

00:40:47.314 --> 00:40:50.274
but because he is so much fond of tea,

00:40:50.394 --> 00:40:52.594
I started, so I keep the practice

00:40:52.714 --> 00:40:55.194
so that I should not give it the practice up.

00:40:55.314 --> 00:40:57.794
Later on it will be difficult

00:40:57.914 --> 00:41:00.754
it just adjusting yourself to others,

00:41:00.874 --> 00:41:02.674
it's not difficult.

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:07.474
Few things here and there that pleases, you should.

00:41:07.594 --> 00:41:09.714
There's no harm in trying to please.

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.514
It's not only for the wife to do it,

00:41:11.634 --> 00:41:15.194
even the husband has to do something to please the wife

00:41:15.314 --> 00:41:17.194
- it's not only between husband and wife,

00:41:17.314 --> 00:41:18.994
it will be between children and you,

00:41:19.114 --> 00:41:21.154
between the whole family of Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:21.274 --> 00:41:25.234
it should be such that we should adjust.

00:41:25.354 --> 00:41:27.754
So practice your adjustments

00:41:27.874 --> 00:41:29.714
as you have to adjust your cameras.

00:41:29.834 --> 00:41:31.834
If you don't adjust the camera,

00:41:31.954 --> 00:41:34.314
you do not get the right picture. In the same way,

00:41:34.434 --> 00:41:36.754
unless and until you adjust yourself

00:41:36.874 --> 00:41:40.034
to the whole atmosphere, to a person,

00:41:40.154 --> 00:41:42.594
you cannot get the real picture,

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:46.714
and then you start fighting with that.

00:41:46.834 --> 00:41:51.194
It is actually the fight has to be within yourself.

00:41:51.314 --> 00:41:53.194
It's quite a long, long story, I mean,

00:41:53.314 --> 00:41:55.114
as far as I know human beings

00:41:55.234 --> 00:41:59.994
and the problems of collectivity,

00:42:00.914 --> 00:42:03.674
and certain problems are being solved now,

00:42:03.794 --> 00:42:07.714
I am happy about it, that people are not falling in love,

00:42:07.834 --> 00:42:11.034
I mean they are not falling and having a bump on their heads.

00:42:11.154 --> 00:42:15.114
But it's better now, they are taking it easy,

00:42:15.234 --> 00:42:18.954
thinking it over and are marrying a person

00:42:19.074 --> 00:42:23.274
for marriage sake and not for falling in love.

00:42:23.394 --> 00:42:25.274
There is something very great is happening

00:42:25.394 --> 00:42:28.314
because that would give you purification of mind

00:42:28.474 --> 00:42:31.154
and a mind which doesn't

00:42:31.234 --> 00:42:34.594
hover over nonsensical things.

00:42:36.154 --> 00:42:39.994
So as I said, practice all these things

00:42:40.114 --> 00:42:43.794
and your collectivity will be beautiful,

00:42:44.794 --> 00:42:49.194
and the best is to practice your meditation together.

00:42:49.314 --> 00:42:52.114
In Delhi we have started an ashram,

00:42:52.234 --> 00:42:54.754
every morning I find people coming,

00:42:54.874 --> 00:42:56.354
sitting together to meditate,

00:42:56.474 --> 00:42:58.834
it's like a temple, it's like a church.

00:42:58.954 --> 00:43:01.314
They come there and so many of them

00:43:01.434 --> 00:43:04.794
are sitting and meditating together.

00:43:05.434 --> 00:43:10.954
Meditating together is the best way to feel the collectivity.

00:43:12.154 --> 00:43:15.594
You can meditate at home, of course, you also cleanse it for your depth,

00:43:15.714 --> 00:43:17.794
but also you must meditate together

00:43:17.914 --> 00:43:19.634
and when you meditate together

00:43:19.754 --> 00:43:23.634
then the strength that you have

00:43:23.754 --> 00:43:25.274
strengthens others,

00:43:25.394 --> 00:43:29.794
and the strength of the whole collectivity improves so much.

00:43:29.874 --> 00:43:33.234
You are meditating together is a very big thing.

00:43:33.474 --> 00:43:37.314
Everyone has to understand that whenever you get time

00:43:37.474 --> 00:43:39.754
you find out in the morning times, for example,

00:43:39.874 --> 00:43:42.554
we'll go to the ashram and meditate.

00:43:42.674 --> 00:43:46.074
Say, Sunday morning, we'll just go and meditate in the ashram.

00:43:46.194 --> 00:43:48.034
Just for meditation you have to come.

00:43:48.154 --> 00:43:49.834
Meditate and go away

00:43:49.954 --> 00:43:52.514
because I reside in this ashram,

00:43:52.634 --> 00:43:55.154
I am here, so leave your homes,

00:43:55.274 --> 00:43:57.594
come here and meditate.

00:43:57.714 --> 00:43:59.874
Meditation will help you a lot.

00:43:59.994 --> 00:44:03.474
Wherever you are together, I am with you

00:44:03.594 --> 00:44:08.434
but when you are away from each other, I am not with you.

00:44:09.034 --> 00:44:12.794
Only in difficulties, when you are pushed into some places

00:44:12.914 --> 00:44:17.714
where I am not there, where you think I am not there, I am there.

00:44:17.794 --> 00:44:19.194
But

00:44:19.354 --> 00:44:22.714
if you deliberately are keeping out of collectivity,

00:44:22.834 --> 00:44:24.234
I am not with you,

00:44:24.354 --> 00:44:26.274
so try to grow your collectivity

00:44:26.394 --> 00:44:31.594
otherwise you cannot go deep into your own depths,

00:44:31.714 --> 00:44:33.514
you cannot become a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:44:33.634 --> 00:44:37.714
you cannot really be called a Sahaja Yogi.

00:44:37.994 --> 00:44:42.914
Those who have a sense of collectivity can only become that.

00:44:43.994 --> 00:44:48.354
So we have before us in Melbourne so many people

00:44:48.474 --> 00:44:52.434
and when the quantity increases, the quality should not fall down

00:44:52.554 --> 00:45:00.794
and the quality of collectivity has to be very strong

00:45:00.914 --> 00:45:03.474
by having very strong bonds.

00:45:03.554 --> 00:45:05.954
I like when you praise someone.

00:45:06.074 --> 00:45:08.634
Normally I have seen whenever I am anywhere,

00:45:08.754 --> 00:45:10.834
people only talk about people who are negative,

00:45:10.954 --> 00:45:12.754
nobody talks about positive people,

00:45:12.874 --> 00:45:16.314
so I don't know about them, mostly I know who are negative.

00:45:16.434 --> 00:45:19.594
So I would love to know about people who are very positive,

00:45:19.714 --> 00:45:22.594
who are great, who are doing good things

00:45:22.714 --> 00:45:26.354
and forget about the negative - they'll drop out anyway.

00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:31.194
So best thing is to tell about the people who are positive,

00:45:31.314 --> 00:45:34.474
who are doing good work,

00:45:34.594 --> 00:45:38.274
who are real Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:38.914 --> 00:45:41.314
I bless you all in Melbourne

00:45:41.434 --> 00:45:43.954
that you have a beautiful collectivity

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:47.434
and enjoy yourself and every, every meeting

00:45:47.554 --> 00:45:50.834
should be a festival for you and an enjoyment.

00:45:50.954 --> 00:45:53.114
May God bless you!

00:45:58.794 --> 00:46:02.554
So thus today we have to worship Virata.

00:46:02.674 --> 00:46:04.234
He is nothing but Akbar

00:46:04.354 --> 00:46:08.754
who is Shri Krishna Himself becoming Virata.
