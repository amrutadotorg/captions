00:00.120 --> 00:05.759
Sahaja Yogi: This is the recording of the
advice given by Her Holiness Shri Mataji on

00:05.759 --> 00:13.519
the occasion of three days seminar held at
Cowasji Jehangir Hall [Mumbai] from 19 to

00:13.519 --> 00:16.110
21st March 1976.

00:16.110 --> 00:26.490
This is a recording of the first day that
is of the 19th March 1976.

00:26.490 --> 00:46.249
Shri Mataji: After a very long time, we are
again assembled in this hall.

00:46.249 --> 01:11.910
When Sahaja Yoga was just in its infancy,
we had arranged a program in this hall.

01:11.910 --> 01:40.220
Since then, by God’s grace, Sahaja Yoga
has settled, in the minds of the Sahaja Yogis.

01:40.220 --> 01:54.430
As if the rain has been absorbed by the hungry
Earth.

01:54.430 --> 02:04.580
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for people who are
superficial and are not seeking within themselves

02:04.580 --> 02:10.899
and with all the earnestness and the hankering
of all seekers.

02:10.899 --> 02:20.390
It is not meant for people who are seeking
God in the books.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.159
Because God is not there.

02:24.159 --> 02:33.599
It is also not meant for people who think
they can achieve God.

02:33.599 --> 02:45.680
That they can by their efforts, by their extreme
‘hatha‘ as we call it, ‘obstinacy’,

02:45.680 --> 02:48.480
win the grace of God.

02:48.480 --> 03:01.109
It is meant for those people who are, from
the heart, all the time asking for Him.

03:01.109 --> 03:06.230
And looking for Him, for the genuine and for
the reality.

03:06.230 --> 03:22.459
‘Sahaja’ – I have told you many a time,
‘saha’ means ‘within’ and ‘ja’

03:22.459 --> 03:25.780
means ‘born with you’.

03:25.780 --> 03:31.359
I have elaborately told you many a time what
is ‘sahaja‘.

03:31.359 --> 03:39.700
It is a ‘spontaneous’ growth of your being
into that infinite realm of God’s grace.

03:39.700 --> 03:44.950
We have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

03:44.950 --> 03:52.109
Not by words, not by deeds, but it has to
be the actualisation of the experience.

03:52.109 --> 04:03.840
If you are satisfied by the tomfoolery and
the spiritual jugglery that is going on, it

04:03.840 --> 04:09.930
is better that you take to that course and
be lost.

04:09.930 --> 04:14.830
But for Sahaja, you have to be an earnest
and genuine seeker.

04:14.830 --> 04:24.200
Whatever mistakes you have committed in your
search will be forgiven by God, because He

04:24.200 --> 04:30.410
knows that it was in ignorance that all these
mistakes were committed.

04:30.410 --> 04:37.080
We have here some Sahaja Yogis who know this.

04:37.080 --> 04:48.310
But when I see people, and I have experience
of them, I am sometimes surprised the way

04:48.310 --> 04:50.729
they are contradictory to themselves.

04:50.729 --> 04:56.979
How they live with those contradictory ideas;
it is something beyond the imagination of

04:56.979 --> 04:59.960
God Almighty also.

04:59.960 --> 05:13.419
It has been since ages, one simple question,
“How to reach the Infinite, through this

05:13.419 --> 05:19.660
finite mind, through this rationality which
God has given us."

05:19.660 --> 05:29.280
This is the eternal problem which has been
there from the times of Socrates, Confucius,

05:29.280 --> 05:30.560
Kant, Hegel.

05:30.560 --> 05:38.659
All these great philosophers have been only
asking this question in all their findings

05:38.659 --> 05:48.850
and searches, “How to reach the Infinite
through this finite?”

05:48.850 --> 05:54.409
As it is, the human being is made that way,
that he has to worry for himself and also

05:54.409 --> 05:55.439
worry about God’s knowing.

05:55.439 --> 06:00.330
He is also worried about how God is going
to give him this blessing.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.830
Who has created you?

06:02.830 --> 06:05.960
Who has created this Universe?

06:05.960 --> 06:12.789
Who has created this beautiful heaven for
you here?

06:12.789 --> 06:18.560
But you are worried how He is going to give
you that blessing by which you will know the

06:18.560 --> 06:22.349
heaven within yourself.

06:22.349 --> 06:30.900
You are worried how He is going to bestow
upon you the bliss of self-knowledge.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.470
You need not worry.

06:33.470 --> 06:40.160
It is His job.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.780
But He has made you like this.

06:45.780 --> 06:50.840
He has made you this way, especially, with
a purpose.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.659
The articulation of your personality came
into being.

06:53.659 --> 07:02.889
Just like any egg develops a shell around
itself to grow, in the same way, you also

07:02.889 --> 07:12.879
develop a shell in which you have to develop
your personality, your being in such a manner

07:12.879 --> 07:22.061
that ultimately you become the proper instrument
to receive that knowledge that is God, that

07:22.061 --> 07:23.469
is Divine.

07:23.469 --> 07:28.419
And then to emit it to others.

07:28.419 --> 07:30.810
And to see it.

07:30.810 --> 07:31.810
To be aware of it.

07:31.810 --> 07:32.810
To be a Sakshi.

07:32.810 --> 07:35.940
To be a witness.

07:35.940 --> 07:43.510
Of that Divine flowing through you.

07:43.510 --> 07:50.750
Of course, some of these philosophers never
had any inkling of that Divine.

07:50.750 --> 07:57.900
Some of them did have; that is why there is
such a disparity to what they say.

07:57.900 --> 08:02.699
But then have been really genuine people,
most of them.

08:02.699 --> 08:08.499
And they have been honest about not finding
it or finding it.

08:08.499 --> 08:18.180
But today, it is the worst time of hypocrisy,
known as Kali Yuga, in which every Dick, Tom,

08:18.180 --> 08:24.220
Harry has started claiming that he is the
person who is going to introduce you to Him.

08:24.220 --> 08:32.590
And he has formed his own ideas and his own
imagination to give you that, this is how

08:32.590 --> 08:38.050
you are going to receive Him, “I have got
it, all right."

08:38.050 --> 08:45.740
There is one good thing about Kali Yuga I
think – that all the ancient scriptures

08:45.740 --> 08:48.899
are for you written down a long time back.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.440
And you have to tally.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.080
If it is the Bible, it is there.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.180
If it is Koran, it is there.

08:57.180 --> 09:01.150
And if it is anyone of the Vedas, it is there.

09:01.150 --> 09:06.680
But when you start your new scriptures and
new ideologies and try to fit in everything

09:06.680 --> 09:22.670
according to that, when you try to mould God
into your own sorts of weaknesses, then how

09:22.670 --> 09:25.620
can you be sahaj, spontaneous?

09:25.620 --> 09:29.750
So, the problem today is Kali Yuga.

09:29.750 --> 09:34.470
Is much worse than it was ever before.

09:34.470 --> 09:47.850
Because apart from the original articulation
we have had, we have many more articulations

09:47.850 --> 09:50.200
on us.

09:50.200 --> 09:57.740
The worst of all is the mental articulation,
that we think by reading books, by talking

09:57.740 --> 10:04.510
about it, by giving lectures and receiving
lectures, you are going to achieve it.

10:04.510 --> 10:06.860
You are sadly mistaken.

10:06.860 --> 10:13.260
This is the greatest maya or illusion, I think,
of the present.

10:13.260 --> 10:23.490
Other mayas can be conquered, but this is
one of the most elusive temptations for the

10:23.490 --> 10:34.490
modern man, that he thinks by reading, by
listening about God, he is going to achieve.

10:34.490 --> 10:37.690
It is spontaneous.

10:37.690 --> 10:40.839
Let us understand what is spontaneous.

10:40.839 --> 10:46.550
Spontaneous is a natural, living thing that
happens to us.

10:46.550 --> 10:52.089
For example, if you see a seed – if you
plant it, it spontaneously grows.

10:52.089 --> 10:56.019
Do you stand on your head in front of that
seed?

10:56.019 --> 10:57.810
Or do you read books?

10:57.810 --> 11:04.530
Or does the seed have to read books of germination,
to get germinated?

11:04.530 --> 11:05.530
Not that.

11:05.530 --> 11:06.530
Never!

11:06.530 --> 11:17.600
But it is only a human being who thinks foolishly,
which an ordinary dog also does not do that.

11:17.600 --> 11:27.459
You may say that; there are books which are
Truth, there are books which are pouring reality.

11:27.459 --> 11:32.550
But have you got the measure to know which
are the books which are pouring reality, and

11:32.550 --> 11:34.630
which are not?

11:34.630 --> 11:43.279
There are gurus, who are of course prospering
materially better because they tell you to

11:43.279 --> 11:49.470
take sanyasa, “You take sanyasa, you renounce
and bring all the money to me”.

11:49.470 --> 11:52.010
And foolishly so many human beings are attached
and attracted towards such people.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.010
Why?

11:53.010 --> 11:56.579
Because our articulation has given way to
this darkness that we go to something false

11:56.579 --> 12:00.540
much faster than to reality.

12:00.540 --> 12:05.279
We are shaken up within ourselves.

12:05.279 --> 12:21.260
We do not have the strength to hold onto the
reality, to ask for the reality.

12:21.260 --> 12:23.230
They have to give us reality!

12:23.230 --> 12:30.930
So, anybody who speaks, you see, in a bombastic
manner, quotations over quotations, reading

12:30.930 --> 12:36.880
this, reading that, giving big lectures; people
are very much fascinated.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.800
They think by listening to lectures, you are
going to have it.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.800
Never, never.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.070
It is going to happen to you.

12:47.070 --> 12:50.339
You have been to so many lectures before.

12:50.339 --> 12:52.040
You have listened to so many people.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.360
There have been many gurus – good and bad.

12:56.360 --> 13:06.759
Have you been able to make out who is a real
guru and who is not?

13:06.759 --> 13:11.900
How will you know that this man is talking
from the seventh heaven?

13:11.900 --> 13:15.350
It may be a rakshasa, talking to you.

13:15.350 --> 13:21.449
It may be a devil incarnated in these horrible
days.

13:21.449 --> 13:30.620
He could be anything who is talking to you.

13:30.620 --> 13:40.270
What makes you believe that some person who
is behaving like a godman is a real godman

13:40.270 --> 13:41.579
or not?

13:41.579 --> 13:44.190
There is a way.

13:44.190 --> 13:57.910
And that is why, when is more necessary, the
things happen by which you know.

13:57.910 --> 14:03.040
You have to become something else to know
what is wrong.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.730
You have to be reborn.

14:05.730 --> 14:07.930
You have to be baptized.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.040
You have to become a Brahmin.

14:10.040 --> 14:15.070
You have to become a Mussalman.

14:15.070 --> 14:21.139
You have to become a Christian.

14:21.139 --> 14:22.139
You are to be reborn.

14:22.139 --> 14:24.267
You are born with a body; you are born with
a mind which is articulated.

14:24.267 --> 14:33.430
You have to jump into that Infinite Love of
God to know Who is emitting that Love.

14:33.430 --> 14:37.690
And then the knowledge comes to you.

14:37.690 --> 14:43.900
Unless and until your eyes are opened, don’t
believe into any personality because he knows

14:43.900 --> 14:51.620
how to impress you people, and even not Me,
unless and until I give you everything, I

14:51.620 --> 14:59.860
give you that which you are seeking.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.069
You must ask for the Reality.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.750
Ask for that from Me.

15:05.750 --> 15:09.709
I cannot give you anything else but that.

15:09.709 --> 15:20.579
Unless and until you have had that experience,
the actualisation of that, of the Sahaja Yoga

15:20.579 --> 15:27.330
by which you receive the blessings within
yourselves and you feel it and it emits through

15:27.330 --> 15:28.330
your extremities.

15:28.330 --> 15:34.149
And you see that power flowing through you
which is known as the Chaitanya Lahari [Waves

15:34.149 --> 15:39.649
of Bliss] which was very well described by
Adi Shankaracharya, whom nobody reads these

15:39.649 --> 15:40.649
days.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.350
They want to read somebody who talks of sex.

15:43.350 --> 15:51.690
The mind is so much attached to sex, that
everything must come through sex; otherwise,

15:51.690 --> 15:54.060
nothing goes here.

15:54.060 --> 15:58.550
These people who try to impress you try to
work on your weakness.

15:58.550 --> 16:02.500
But a Mother is not going to do that.

16:02.500 --> 16:10.190
A Mother is going to give you the real that
is there and is going to tell you that, “My

16:10.190 --> 16:30.149
child, this has been wrong and you have to
get detached from that idea.

16:30.149 --> 16:31.149
And stand within yourselves."

16:31.149 --> 16:35.360
Every one of them, those who have been great,
has been saying, “Na yoga, na sankya”

16:35.360 --> 16:36.610
[neither yoga nor reasoning] – Shankaracharya’s.

16:36.610 --> 16:39.860
But Hindus are the first who will go to yoga
– to hatha yoga.

16:39.860 --> 16:44.560
When Shankaracharya never did anyone of these
yoga’s.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.779
Yoga’s are meant for very, very few people.

16:48.779 --> 16:54.920
For very few people who live with a guru,
in the jungles.

16:54.920 --> 17:01.540
You have to do six things simultaneously under
the guidance of an evolved soul.

17:01.540 --> 17:06.880
But everybody is trying to do yoga because
they want to slim down.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.750
God is not to be used for these frivolous
things.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.630
All right, you do exercises.

17:12.630 --> 17:15.819
But this is not yoga.

17:15.819 --> 17:18.240
Yoga means ‘union with God’.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.140
It is union with God.

17:22.140 --> 17:36.910
It is not union with the worldly things that
you think so important.

17:36.910 --> 17:49.300
Those who go to the extremes of things are
also no good for Sahaja Yoga.

17:49.300 --> 17:53.020
Extreme takes you away from reality which
was said by Gautama Buddha.

17:53.020 --> 17:57.670
He said, “Take to the middle path, keep
to the middle path."

17:57.670 --> 18:02.130
But His disciples have gone to the extreme
path.

18:02.130 --> 18:03.130
Of foolishness.

18:03.130 --> 18:11.950
He said, “Do not worship any Gods or Goddesses
at that time”, because He was in sahaja.

18:11.950 --> 18:17.080
So, His disciples started worshipping his
tooth, nail, everything.

18:17.080 --> 18:21.070
Of course, that too has a meaning.

18:21.070 --> 18:23.590
But not for people who are not realised.

18:23.590 --> 18:33.710
How can you make out that the hair of Mohammad
Saheb is in that place in Kashmir or it is

18:33.710 --> 18:35.450
of some imposter?

18:35.450 --> 18:40.780
Have you got any method by which you can detect?

18:40.780 --> 18:44.280
I can say that it is the hair of Mohammad
Saheb.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.280
I say that.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.690
But why should you accept me also?

18:48.690 --> 18:55.780
With all your brains and intelligence, why
should you accept anything which is not actually

18:55.780 --> 18:58.510
focused within your awareness?

18:58.510 --> 19:03.960
Which is not actually brought within your
awareness.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.680
There is a method.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.280
There is a way.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.010
There is an education.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.700
But it is a spontaneous one.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.840
It happens to you.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.520
You just become.

19:18.520 --> 19:29.860
This education comes to you in such a manner,
in such a way, that even a child knows.

19:29.860 --> 19:35.300
It is a subjective knowledge that comes to
you.

19:35.300 --> 19:43.220
When you jump into that Divine Love through
Sahaja Yoga, then you become one with the

19:43.220 --> 19:48.980
collective consciousness.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.850
It is not that I tell you that you are collectively
conscious, but you become conscious.

19:52.850 --> 20:03.549
For example, now, for Me, when I say that
this sari has got a border, you will say,

20:03.549 --> 20:04.499
“Yes of course we know."
