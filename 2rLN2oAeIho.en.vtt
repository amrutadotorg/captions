00:03.600 --> 00:08.915
I believe you all say these things,

00:13.278 --> 00:15.278
and you listen to it,

00:25.269 --> 00:27.269
and you say it from your heart.

00:30.449 --> 00:36.673
Only the one who are united with God can worship Shri Ganesha.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.920
And Shri Ganesha worships your Mother.

00:57.510 --> 00:59.510
First of all

01:01.421 --> 01:03.421
one must to understand

01:06.037 --> 01:09.034
that there is a combination of a Mother and a Guru.

01:12.484 --> 01:14.484
Because Guru is a very hard task master.

01:17.260 --> 01:19.260
He does not allow any liberties to be taken.

01:22.325 --> 01:24.325
And Mother is very kindly.

01:30.724 --> 01:34.245
But you don't have feelings for the Mother, do you?

01:47.955 --> 01:50.781
Is it all a lip-service that you listen,

01:51.281 --> 01:54.792
goes into your head, and you think you have become

01:56.510 --> 01:58.870
the surrendered Sahaja yogis?

02:00.364 --> 02:04.271
Like all Islam people believe they are surrendered to God,

02:04.322 --> 02:07.322
like Christians believe they are surrendered to God.

02:08.656 --> 02:12.103
It's just a lip-service that you are this, you are that.

02:13.082 --> 02:17.858
Or do you know it him, what is said, is a fact.

02:21.436 --> 02:23.695
Have you not seen the Sun in my hand?

02:24.868 --> 02:26.517
What more proof you want?

02:48.552 --> 02:53.166
Anybody who misleads you is of course sinful no doubt,

02:55.409 --> 02:57.824
but to fall a trap to such a person!

03:01.035 --> 03:05.247
If you had told a child that the Mother is coming, he would have fought,

03:05.747 --> 03:06.534
"I'm going".

03:09.994 --> 03:11.994
He would have cried and wept.

03:16.976 --> 03:18.976
What about your vibrations?

03:20.195 --> 03:22.195
You don't use your vibrations?

03:23.940 --> 03:26.770
You have come all the way for Guru Puja here,

03:27.381 --> 03:30.143
who is your Guru? Whom are you going to worship?

03:31.777 --> 03:36.217
Anybody comes from anywhere becomes suddenly important. How?

03:43.440 --> 03:45.440
It was never done before,

03:46.327 --> 03:48.994
first time I see such a horrible thing.

03:51.514 --> 03:55.445
In my living time if you are doing like this, after my death so many gurus will rise,

03:56.402 --> 03:57.087
to mislead you.

04:05.389 --> 04:07.389
Are you going to accept all that?

04:27.007 --> 04:31.727
All the Deities refused for me to do this.

04:31.923 --> 04:35.482
They tortured my life, they would not accept

04:36.540 --> 04:41.139
to allow you to have the Puja. Absolutely, nothing doing.

04:46.093 --> 04:48.684
Because they love me, they respect me.

04:49.184 --> 04:51.184
They have the proper protocol.

04:51.241 --> 04:53.241
They don't want to become gurus themselves,

04:53.741 --> 04:55.741
and misbehave in this manner.

05:11.956 --> 05:18.141
Last time when I came I really was very strong, with the French.

05:21.435 --> 05:27.565
I've told so many times that France is the Hell of the Universe.

05:34.539 --> 05:38.465
And you should fall a trap to something like that?

05:39.076 --> 05:43.207
It's very supra-conscious, extremely supra-conscious.

05:44.744 --> 05:45.762
And arrogant.

05:56.997 --> 06:00.897
I've never known of such a Guru Puja. Never.

06:02.448 --> 06:05.595
Indians had only one Guru Puja, and they are praying that

06:05.901 --> 06:08.682
they should have at least one more Guru Puja.

06:10.012 --> 06:13.580
With all these Guru Pujas if you have achieved this kind of surrendering,

06:14.135 --> 06:16.871
it's better you do not have any more Guru Pujas at all.

06:17.371 --> 06:20.154
Don't deserve it. You cannot become Gurus,

06:20.654 --> 06:21.924
I can see that clearly.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.420
Without surrender how will you?

06:59.564 --> 07:02.931
All the Blessings of the Divine

07:04.870 --> 07:06.096
have been showered upon you.

07:08.892 --> 07:10.892
And what have you given back?

07:16.787 --> 07:18.787
Such ego?

07:19.287 --> 07:22.538
That you act to somebody because he has greater egos?

07:42.211 --> 07:44.211
It is a very bad example.

07:51.296 --> 07:55.031
You have to wash the feet of the Indians and drink that water.

07:55.531 --> 07:58.659
May be then you might realize where you are.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.353
You may be very developed and all that.

08:02.572 --> 08:04.572
And the Indians who are of your type,

08:06.151 --> 08:08.151
all of them have to do that.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.204
Why didn't you see your vibrations?

08:21.028 --> 08:24.848
When the blind gets his eyes, he doesn't close his eyes to see things, does he?

08:29.498 --> 08:31.498
And what has happened to your leaders also?

08:40.039 --> 08:42.039
All of them put together could not

08:42.111 --> 08:44.539
say that we will not have this nonsense at this time?

08:55.542 --> 08:59.700
Just coming to the airport, so many people have risen higher in life.

09:00.695 --> 09:01.930
What are you doing here?

09:08.529 --> 09:10.529
You should have protested.

09:13.431 --> 09:17.057
I would like to know how many wanted to go to the airport and asked for it.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.277
Raise your hands. Honestly.

09:22.367 --> 09:23.234
Honestly.

09:35.178 --> 09:37.178
These are the only people who love me.

09:41.418 --> 09:42.304
May God Bless you.

10:02.909 --> 10:05.993
Tomorrow somebody tells you to insult me, will you do that?

10:17.183 --> 10:21.567
You know that if a king arrives from a small little place somewhere,

10:23.292 --> 10:26.651
or a prime minister from a very small island,

10:31.470 --> 10:33.602
from lardy and muddy island

10:34.102 --> 10:35.304
the prime minister came,

10:36.118 --> 10:39.907
and the prime minister of England had to go receive him.

10:49.177 --> 10:50.824
And if your Guru has come,

10:50.927 --> 10:52.927
all the gurus have to come to receive me,

10:55.529 --> 10:57.679
or to listen to something nonsensical here?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.846
I felt like going back from the airport only,

11:05.346 --> 11:07.346
the kind of vibrations I felt.

11:12.943 --> 11:14.943
How do you get into this kind of a maya?

11:19.183 --> 11:22.346
How you join hands? Except for a few.

11:32.411 --> 11:34.411
“Your quality will be known:

11:36.417 --> 11:39.146
how much you are surrendered to Me".

11:40.440 --> 11:41.552
Christ has said that.

11:47.099 --> 11:48.830
And today I say to you that.

11:52.491 --> 11:55.058
On all other things Sahaja yogis will protest.

11:56.121 --> 11:58.951
"This was not good, that was not good, this was done”.

11:59.069 --> 12:01.517
Against each other, against everything they will protest.

12:07.759 --> 12:10.094
"Sahaja yogi took this much money from us, and

12:10.131 --> 12:12.131
this should not have happened," they always tell me.

12:12.168 --> 12:14.901
Complaints and complaints, and complaints, and complaints!

12:21.723 --> 12:25.814
And for this kind of a nonsense they have no protest, nothing!

12:36.855 --> 12:39.202
You are all ego-oriented people and you like

12:39.421 --> 12:41.421
egoistical supra-conscious nonsense.

12:41.441 --> 12:42.790
That's what it is.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.193
You have all come for Guru Puja or for what have you come for?

12:55.424 --> 12:56.448
It is beyond me.

13:02.122 --> 13:05.363
This I'm talking to you as your Mother, and not as your Guru.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.880
As a Guru I’ll do what I have to do.

13:12.581 --> 13:15.446
I'm talking to you as a Mother. Is this the way to respect Her?

13:20.266 --> 13:23.165
I told you, this is the last Guru Puja you'll be having,

13:23.270 --> 13:26.004
the last Puja you will be having, perhaps may be.

13:34.736 --> 13:36.736
It's shocking!

13:48.158 --> 13:50.158
You have to respect your Guru.

13:50.476 --> 13:51.788
Surrender to your Guru.

13:53.182 --> 13:55.347
It is said that the Guru is

13:55.384 --> 13:59.070
the Param Chaitanya, but it is: the Param Chaitanya itself is your Guru.

14:05.685 --> 14:11.159
"Agata Parama Chaitanya, Dhanyoham Tava Dharshan -

14:12.756 --> 14:15.859
When the Paramchaitanya itself will come on this earth,

14:16.623 --> 14:18.539
I will feel myself so gratified

14:18.609 --> 14:20.958
to see the darshan of that Maya.

14:23.808 --> 14:25.808
In what world are you living?

14:26.308 --> 14:27.277
Where are you?

14:30.408 --> 14:31.371
Taking for granted?

14:41.270 --> 14:44.010
I know Mother has a right to punish you, very well.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.939
Even Krishna could be punished by His Mother.

14:53.992 --> 14:55.231
But I'm not interested.

15:01.308 --> 15:03.441
The children who want to disrespect me,

15:03.577 --> 15:05.577
and insult me, I have nothing to do with them.

15:09.271 --> 15:11.271
They have no love for me, I have nothing to do.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.057
Only those

15:20.838 --> 15:24.517
who protested and wanted to go to the airport should come forward to do my Puja.

15:28.757 --> 15:29.752
Honestly.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.379
You should be ashamed of yourself.

15:44.404 --> 15:47.220
You have insulted your Mother, who has given you Realization,

15:48.680 --> 15:51.157
who has done so much for you. Selflessly I've been working

15:52.203 --> 15:53.053
day in and day out,

15:58.319 --> 16:01.301
neglecting my own children, my own family,

16:02.827 --> 16:03.769
my grandchildren.

16:04.269 --> 16:05.294
For you?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.995
Only those people who wanted to go to the airport

16:31.495 --> 16:34.078
and said, and did not go, please come forward.

16:36.415 --> 16:36.912
Please.

16:52.305 --> 16:52.745
Come.

17:02.363 --> 17:04.363
He is meeting Me after so many years.

17:06.187 --> 17:07.037
When did you come?

17:10.913 --> 17:11.797
Just imagine,

17:12.247 --> 17:14.565
they come all the way from here and there, and there.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.399
And nicely you are telling them to listen to some nonsense?

17:18.346 --> 17:20.763
They have not come here to listen to anybody’s nonsense.

17:34.039 --> 17:36.039
Come forward, this side.

17:38.856 --> 17:41.735
Yes, of course, those who could not come,

17:41.788 --> 17:43.788
because they arrived late, I told them

17:44.040 --> 17:45.319
there is no program in the evening.

17:48.516 --> 17:49.490
All the Spanish,

17:50.685 --> 17:51.666
how sweet they were.

17:53.275 --> 17:55.275
Those who were here and did not come,

17:56.371 --> 17:57.249
otherwise.

18:08.059 --> 18:10.507
/?/

18:11.603 --> 18:14.127
/?/

18:14.468 --> 18:15.217
When did you come?

18:18.183 --> 18:18.842
/?/

18:22.701 --> 18:24.701
/?/

18:26.397 --> 18:27.333
/?/

18:28.909 --> 18:30.909
/?/

18:43.622 --> 18:46.004
/?/

18:53.655 --> 18:54.653
/?/

18:59.208 --> 19:01.048
Yes, you can come along Swiss people…

19:39.261 --> 19:41.587
Those who were here and did not come,

19:50.444 --> 19:53.563
should understand that you are living

19:56.380 --> 19:57.809
in the Kingdom of God.

20:02.066 --> 20:06.548
And when the Goddess of that Kingdom arrives,

20:07.098 --> 20:08.536
you have to be there.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.823
I'm sorry I have to do that,

20:26.909 --> 20:28.909
this is the promise I had to give to all the Deities.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.508
Know that you have to have all and more,

20:47.100 --> 20:49.100
you have to work hard. You have to meditate.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.858
Shows, that there is no discipline.

21:01.914 --> 21:05.272
I will also forgive Austrians, because their leader wanted to go.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.732
Austrians should be forgiven,

21:09.381 --> 21:11.381
because their leader wanted to go.

21:13.619 --> 21:15.619
They could come up too.

21:24.575 --> 21:27.273
One man can save and one man can destroy.

21:30.487 --> 21:32.801
Your leader is alright till it comes to Mother's point,

21:33.301 --> 21:35.301
but when you reach that point,

21:37.390 --> 21:39.390
then, you have to protest against your leader.

21:45.285 --> 21:47.088
Come along, come, sit here.

21:47.191 --> 21:48.560
All the rest should go at the back,

21:50.285 --> 21:51.319
just go at the back.

21:54.285 --> 21:58.447
Please go back. All others, go back,

22:00.734 --> 22:01.725
and sit down there.

22:06.263 --> 22:10.328
I had to promise this. I had to promise this to the Deities.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.560
They would not accept, they would not accept!

22:33.168 --> 22:36.442
You must know there are Deities and Ganas and everyone is sitting here.

22:36.479 --> 22:39.805
They came forward before me, to France.

22:49.092 --> 22:51.624
24 hours they are working, you know that very well.

22:51.677 --> 22:53.677
You know it, it's not a story. You know that.

22:54.326 --> 22:57.724
They are working for you, helping you in every way, solving all your problems,

22:58.075 --> 22:58.547
don't they?

23:08.132 --> 23:10.132
Gavin also should not do my Puja.

23:10.136 --> 23:11.322
Because he should have said that.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.568
So Gavin should go back.

23:14.409 --> 23:16.263
And all the English, who came here early,

23:16.472 --> 23:18.750
just to attend everything, to attend what, the nonsense?

23:23.151 --> 23:25.516
Gavin said he did not know, there was going to be a lecture

23:25.524 --> 23:26.816
otherwise he would of object it.

23:27.048 --> 23:28.668
But what about coming to the airport_

23:36.177 --> 23:38.177
English know how much I have worked with them.

23:45.474 --> 23:48.110
All the leaders who did not protest should also go back.

23:56.134 --> 23:57.241
All should go.

23:58.290 --> 23:59.898
Those who have not protested.

24:14.181 --> 24:15.267
Guido you protested?

24:16.305 --> 24:18.337
Yes, Italians could be there.

24:25.192 --> 24:26.406
Guido protested,

24:26.634 --> 24:29.895
he could not understand: what was happening? Where is our Mother?

24:32.904 --> 24:35.936
Come this side. All the rest go at the back.

24:40.691 --> 24:42.775
What courage is needed for that kind of a thing?

24:50.991 --> 24:51.744
Of course.

24:58.399 --> 25:00.413
Otherwise there is a protest for everything,

25:00.658 --> 25:02.658
every day I'm receiving letters from people:

25:04.378 --> 25:06.921
"This is not good, that is not working out in Australia,

25:06.928 --> 25:09.079
is not working out here, that is not happening”.

25:09.380 --> 25:11.370
Everybody has a right to criticize everyone.

25:47.182 --> 25:50.545
French have been stupid in the past, and they are stupid even now.

25:51.492 --> 25:52.153
That's what they are,

25:53.090 --> 25:54.196
think knowing no end of themselves.

25:55.299 --> 25:57.775
Spanish people were, once upon a time, very aggressive,

25:58.056 --> 26:00.056
but in Sahaja Yoga they are not like that.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.230
You must learn how to respect.

26:13.061 --> 26:14.638
You've had no good training.

26:15.138 --> 26:17.910
“Very bad breeding” - that's what God is going to say about you.

26:21.861 --> 26:23.973
I've done my level best to tell you how to behave.

26:41.581 --> 26:43.947
No protocol, any sense of protocol you have.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.075
It's like beggars.

26:59.881 --> 27:01.881
Today you have to resolve,

27:04.955 --> 27:06.955
and ask the forgiveness of all the Deities,

27:08.423 --> 27:12.744
that you are going to use your vibrations all the time. Resolve.

27:14.869 --> 27:18.909
And that no more such a thing we are going to repeat again. This is the last,

27:19.938 --> 27:20.695
never like this.

27:21.524 --> 27:23.787
I am very suppressed that English,

27:23.794 --> 27:26.686
they come even in sleet, in snow, this, that.

27:26.857 --> 27:29.729
And here what happened, as soon as they came to hell they became hellish?

27:31.179 --> 27:33.179
What have happen to the English?

27:39.065 --> 27:41.065
They have no personality of their own?

27:42.533 --> 27:46.155
Always they followed the French, and now go with them to the ditch.

27:46.655 --> 27:49.150
Is that the principle now maintain?

27:53.612 --> 27:56.104
“French Sahaja yogis said, French Sahaja yogis said”.

28:00.584 --> 28:03.668
Tomorrow French Sahaja yogi said: “Go and kill your Mother”. We’ll kill it.

28:03.912 --> 28:04.319
Is it?

28:05.988 --> 28:07.988
Because French Sahaja yogi have said.

28:23.588 --> 28:27.529
No individuality, no understanding of anything, stupid.

28:29.529 --> 28:30.673
/?/

28:34.187 --> 28:35.042
/?/

28:52.734 --> 28:53.563
/?/

28:56.320 --> 29:00.339
/?/

29:02.217 --> 29:04.830
/?/

29:06.633 --> 29:08.633
/?/

29:10.102 --> 29:11.178
/?/

29:21.645 --> 29:23.645
/?/

29:26.265 --> 29:28.265
/?/

29:29.613 --> 29:32.552
/?/

29:35.551 --> 29:38.920
This Yashi has come to Me from her childhood.

29:39.269 --> 29:41.208
And as children they used to come all the way.

29:41.209 --> 29:44.691
Do you know where this Old Delhi is,

29:44.826 --> 29:46.960
and where her father was working for the university.

29:48.137 --> 29:52.236
Whether I came at 6 o’clock, or 8 o’clock, or 10 o’clock,

29:52.489 --> 29:54.489
or in the night of a 12 o’clock.

29:54.584 --> 29:58.391
Her father with all his three daughters used to be there.

30:00.688 --> 30:03.255
And so much bubbling and joy that Mother has come.

30:27.578 --> 30:29.578
/?/

30:30.166 --> 30:31.689
/?/

30:34.092 --> 30:35.157
/?/

30:36.238 --> 30:38.238
/?/

30:39.654 --> 30:41.654
/?/

30:47.335 --> 30:48.655
/?/

30:49.155 --> 30:51.333
/?/

30:51.833 --> 30:53.833
/?/

30:55.725 --> 30:57.725
/?/

31:09.573 --> 31:13.762
/?/

31:26.896 --> 31:29.129
/?/

31:31.708 --> 31:34.845
Many people have not seen me for month together.

31:36.420 --> 31:37.832
Whether you have seen me or not.

31:48.270 --> 31:51.354
As I'm angry with you,

31:52.365 --> 31:54.365
also I'm pleased with some people,

31:56.680 --> 31:59.087
those who have love for me.

32:06.653 --> 32:10.899
And as a symbol of that I want to give this ring to Guido.

32:37.425 --> 32:40.173
What surprises me, the gurus who lynch you,

32:45.166 --> 32:46.373
the one who wanted this,

32:50.291 --> 32:53.442
Rolls Royce. They starved themselves for one year,

32:54.206 --> 32:55.538
bought a Rolls Royce,

33:00.866 --> 33:03.571
and went to receive him, and such a crowd

33:03.578 --> 33:05.807
that people could not get to the airport.

33:06.624 --> 33:08.624
That sort of a guru you need,

33:09.882 --> 33:11.882
who'll take you to hell!

33:17.175 --> 33:19.175
You don't want to go to heaven.

33:19.675 --> 33:22.946
You don't want to be the citizen of God's realm.

33:53.419 --> 33:54.848
Now whatever mantra you say,

33:56.934 --> 33:58.121
please listen.

33:59.749 --> 34:01.749
Put it in your heads what you are talking.

34:05.861 --> 34:08.805
What you are saying from your lips, listen.

34:09.939 --> 34:12.255
Put it in your heart what you are saying.

34:16.191 --> 34:17.549
Don't be hypocrites.

34:24.481 --> 34:26.062
No explanation is needed.

34:26.174 --> 34:29.338
"I've been to a guru, I've done this, I've done"- nothing of the kind.

34:33.098 --> 34:35.098
Even if at this stage, after so many days,

34:36.303 --> 34:39.380
if you have not realized that whatever we believe into

34:40.972 --> 34:42.054
should be

34:43.100 --> 34:44.580
part and parcel of ourselves.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.833
I mean these wretched people like

34:46.875 --> 34:48.768
Christians and other people, these

34:48.810 --> 34:50.582
Hindus and Muslims and all that,

34:50.677 --> 34:53.474
they've not seen God, they've not got realization, nothing

34:53.674 --> 34:55.902
but to them it becomes a faith, they fight for it.

34:57.213 --> 34:59.972
And for you people who have seen the reality - it is not,

35:01.283 --> 35:02.428
what's wrong with me?

35:14.346 --> 35:16.684
People are afraid of the police, afraid of this.

35:16.743 --> 35:18.743
You have entered into the Kingdom of God.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.138
You have seen what has happened

35:21.607 --> 35:24.446
with people who have tried to trouble me.

35:32.558 --> 35:33.626
Aren't you afraid of that?

35:45.227 --> 35:46.574
Don't become frivolous:

35:48.572 --> 35:51.411
"What was there to go to the airport, after all doesn't matter".

35:55.682 --> 35:57.808
All the Ganas went there, with me.

36:01.110 --> 36:03.374
They have all noted down, and they are here too.

36:07.962 --> 36:11.060
I am so cautiously taking you out, because you don't see them.

36:11.119 --> 36:12.873
But you'll see them very soon.

36:22.818 --> 36:25.436
It's not easy to control them also, you must know that.

36:26.993 --> 36:29.242
I do not control you, neither I control them.

36:38.993 --> 36:43.362
So now, I don't want to be unkind to people

36:43.757 --> 36:46.971
who have been desiring to come and see me, who love me so much.

36:48.493 --> 36:52.085
And I want to forgive you all, all of you,

36:52.990 --> 36:54.990
because this was the first mistake.

37:19.913 --> 37:22.442
Nobody should fix my program without asking me.

37:23.523 --> 37:25.034
Nobody should take such liberties.

37:25.710 --> 37:28.554
From next time I will not do anything of the kind,

37:28.560 --> 37:29.898
I'm telling you very clearly!

37:30.696 --> 37:32.696
You fix my program, and I'll let you down!

37:34.023 --> 37:36.371
Without asking me you are not to fix me anywhere.

37:40.989 --> 37:43.524
Without taking my permission, written permission.

37:45.612 --> 37:48.938
If you ever try to do such tricks with me, I'll put you right.

37:55.028 --> 37:58.494
You know I have all the powers to correct you.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.533
Don't take liberties with me anymore.

38:04.686 --> 38:06.252
I'm telling you, I am warning you.

38:09.795 --> 38:11.795
Try to understand, you are facing

38:13.138 --> 38:15.420
Someone, Who has all the Powers.

38:22.122 --> 38:22.883
You know that,

38:25.384 --> 38:28.105
know well, within yourself.

38:32.657 --> 38:36.452
It's not even like Mohammad. Mohammad just talked.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.430
He never gave realization,

38:41.977 --> 38:42.723
He warned.

38:44.464 --> 38:45.826
None of them, none of them.

38:47.930 --> 38:51.847
But after seeing, none of them have photographs as you have seen of mine.

38:51.926 --> 38:52.492
Have they?

39:01.562 --> 39:04.228
What more proof you want to know what I am.

39:06.099 --> 39:08.099
Now behave yourself. I'm warning you!

39:10.188 --> 39:10.964
Mahamaya -

39:14.128 --> 39:16.128
the other side of it is horrible.

39:17.687 --> 39:18.344
Be careful.

39:25.917 --> 39:27.013
Only for those

39:28.728 --> 39:30.728
who are my children I come on this earth.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.111
Not for those who are not,

39:35.340 --> 39:36.450
I've nothing to do with them.

39:44.553 --> 39:45.566
I did try

39:46.253 --> 39:48.331
to save you, as a prodigal son has to be saved,

39:48.426 --> 39:50.426
that's different. That's very different.

39:53.310 --> 39:56.628
But don't take liberties with me, I must tell you and warn you.

40:26.283 --> 40:28.264
I do not need any. The heat is just

40:29.465 --> 40:30.506
drying up everything.

40:46.732 --> 40:49.505
I feel like a Mother who is insulted, abused,

40:50.254 --> 40:52.254
ill-treated by her own children.

40:57.814 --> 40:59.526
You can take interest from others,

40:59.548 --> 41:01.655
not from your own children. You cannot.

41:02.049 --> 41:03.253
Very difficult.

41:11.549 --> 41:13.462
If you do not understand any protocol,

41:13.809 --> 41:15.040
because you are so naive,

41:15.425 --> 41:18.116
you have never known anything, you don't know how to respect.

41:22.691 --> 41:23.607
Then you better learn it.

41:32.276 --> 41:33.200
There is no Shraddha,

41:34.542 --> 41:37.455
because it was never there. You don't know how to respect anyone.

41:38.828 --> 41:41.552
You only have respect for yourself, perhaps may not be that even.

41:54.248 --> 41:58.925
Today is a day of a very great event.

42:02.544 --> 42:03.221
And

42:06.706 --> 42:11.331
“Guru" is a word as I told you, comes from the word "Gravity".

42:14.341 --> 42:17.283
The gravity. And the gravity,

42:18.422 --> 42:21.526
that's what I felt, that I have no gravity to attract you people.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.923
Or you people have no weight at all in you, that I should gravitate you.

42:35.548 --> 42:37.548
Anything that has weight

42:40.261 --> 42:43.832
gravitates, automatically.

42:46.575 --> 42:50.261
It does not gravitate towards itself, but it gravitates.

42:53.063 --> 42:56.705
There's also gravity between the matter.

42:59.849 --> 43:04.661
But what it has towards Mother Earth is incomparable.

43:06.617 --> 43:08.617
You throw any stone out, it comes back.

43:15.162 --> 43:17.162
Impossible to fight the gravity.

43:22.252 --> 43:26.656
And that gravity is the integration

43:27.423 --> 43:29.423
of your Shraddha,

43:30.755 --> 43:32.875
of your Dedication, and your surrender.

43:45.569 --> 43:50.640
Without that gravity you cannot nourish yourself, you cannot grow.

43:52.299 --> 43:54.299
Just imagine, the roots

43:56.403 --> 43:58.403
go towards the gravity.

44:00.195 --> 44:03.285
And when they are nourished, then only, the tree rises above.

44:05.760 --> 44:09.098
If your roots are not deep, if your roots are so flimsy,

44:09.880 --> 44:11.179
you cannot go down.

44:15.318 --> 44:17.948
Unless you go down in that gravity,

44:19.533 --> 44:20.382
you cannot come up.

44:22.174 --> 44:23.328
You cannot nourish yourself.

44:23.632 --> 44:25.853
Now my talk should not be a waste again.

44:26.353 --> 44:27.267
Please listen to me.

44:28.466 --> 44:31.323
I'm addressing to you, all of you. Remember that.

44:33.193 --> 44:36.416
Do not think that I'm addressing to somebody else. It is to you all.

44:39.181 --> 44:42.237
So the only way one can ascend in Sahaja Yoga is through

44:42.737 --> 44:43.607
putting the roots down.

44:44.498 --> 44:46.052
Allow the roots to grow.

44:47.670 --> 44:50.166
Unless and until roots grow, the tree cannot grow.

44:50.199 --> 44:53.199
I have seen many Sahaja yogis who talk big about Sahaja Yoga,

44:53.209 --> 44:55.672
they can write books, they can write things.

44:55.858 --> 44:59.060
The other day I saw somebody writing a big pamphlet about Sahaja Yoga,

45:00.104 --> 45:01.403
nothing inside the person!

45:06.861 --> 45:08.401
That's not the sign of a Sahaja yogi.

45:08.737 --> 45:11.292
A Sahaja yogi has to gravitate inside.

45:14.270 --> 45:15.097
How do we do it?

45:16.946 --> 45:22.190
In the year 1982 I told you the eightfold ways of doing it,

45:22.198 --> 45:23.700
and I said: I will tell you later.

45:24.984 --> 45:26.984
And I was about to tell you. But not now,

45:30.310 --> 45:33.165
there are other eight ways by which you can rise.

45:34.868 --> 45:39.088
Because, you are not yet grounded in Sahaja Yoga, you are not yet grounded.

45:45.093 --> 45:48.214
I thought you would be grounded, you're not.

45:50.665 --> 45:52.665
You have to nourish

45:54.787 --> 45:59.198
the other way around. The roots are in the head,

46:03.344 --> 46:09.441
by becoming thoughtless, by not making the cells to think.

46:12.840 --> 46:16.968
By resting them, by peace within. It is not a show of a peace,

46:17.614 --> 46:21.916
or just some people look very peaceful for a show.

46:22.726 --> 46:24.726
You have to work it out here in your head.

46:26.721 --> 46:28.721
The grounding - it has to go into your awareness.

46:32.211 --> 46:34.211
How? - Meditation.

46:36.680 --> 46:38.680
There's no discipline I'm told.

46:39.964 --> 46:42.458
Hounslow, I'm told, there's no discipline of any kind.

46:43.104 --> 46:45.306
I'm surprised Hounslow people have no discipline

46:45.478 --> 46:47.607
of getting up early in the morning and doing meditation.

46:53.722 --> 46:54.436
What are you doing?

46:57.853 --> 46:58.938
How are you going to grow?

47:02.610 --> 47:05.013
How does the tree grow? It does not grow in the day time.

47:06.224 --> 47:09.234
It grows in the morning, early in the morning, you never see that.

47:15.877 --> 47:18.249
How these roots are going to grow into the head?

47:19.114 --> 47:23.858
Into your brain, into that Jada (gross).

47:27.913 --> 47:31.461
You have to meditate. That's the only way you can do it.

47:31.724 --> 47:35.021
Those who do not meditate will become superficial.

47:36.341 --> 47:38.692
They'll not achieve anything, they create problems /?/.

47:39.575 --> 47:42.448
If they are right sided, they'll become supra-conscious, they'll become bhoots.

47:43.714 --> 47:46.425
If they are left-sided, they'll become left sided they will be thrown out!

47:46.466 --> 47:48.306
You've seen it, in the Sistine Chapel,

47:48.480 --> 47:50.724
you see Christ throwing them out one by one.

47:51.777 --> 47:55.225
And then you should not blame me. Just listening to me is not sufficient.

47:56.530 --> 48:00.812
It must grow. Actualization of the growth of the thing is needed.

48:00.951 --> 48:01.705
Do you follow that?

48:06.784 --> 48:09.920
You've read all kinds of nonsensical things before.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.649
All kinds of horrid things, I know what you have read.

48:14.760 --> 48:18.353
You have read in this horrible French country all kinds of

48:19.694 --> 48:21.001
sadists, like Sade,

48:24.446 --> 48:26.095
or Sade whatever you call him.

48:28.999 --> 48:30.244
And there were many like this,

48:31.456 --> 48:32.925
who wrote horrible books for you,

48:33.425 --> 48:35.425
which you have read. But they have not read "Advent".

48:35.925 --> 48:37.925
How many Sahaja yogis who have not yet read "Advent"?

48:39.499 --> 48:42.790
But only reading is not going to help, it must go into your brain.

48:43.806 --> 48:46.646
And brain means what? Into your Central Nervous System.

48:47.355 --> 48:49.355
Brain doesn't mean in the thinking.

48:50.078 --> 48:52.373
Into your central nervous system, into

48:53.836 --> 48:56.031
the cells of your central nervous system.

48:58.512 --> 49:00.512
That light has to come into the cells.

49:03.775 --> 49:05.775
You have to grow and grow, and grow!

49:11.173 --> 49:13.665
There's only way left out for you to go to Himalayas,

49:15.309 --> 49:17.309
and not to any Ashram or any place.

49:18.172 --> 49:20.506
But settle down somewhere where you don't eat anything

49:20.573 --> 49:23.666
or do anything, and take another birth. That's the only way I think.

49:30.822 --> 49:33.100
We can work it out, not difficult.

49:36.628 --> 49:38.628
If you have the seeking within your heart,

49:40.635 --> 49:42.024
and if you have understanding,

49:42.105 --> 49:44.049
sense, intelligence to understand that

49:44.061 --> 49:46.870
you have achieved something in life, you can do it.

49:50.286 --> 49:51.339
You all can do it.

49:56.067 --> 49:58.438
We don't forgive others, we forgive ourselves.

49:58.464 --> 49:59.955
This is the worst thing that we do.

50:01.906 --> 50:03.906
We all the time try to forgive others,

50:05.662 --> 50:06.708
that's the best way

50:09.455 --> 50:11.780
to work it out. But no, we try

50:13.215 --> 50:16.092
to forgive ourselves all the time and not to forgive others.

50:17.639 --> 50:19.639
Everything you do the other way around.

50:20.976 --> 50:25.704
We are Sahaja yogis. We're yogis, Saints.

50:28.771 --> 50:32.109
So, you have to be the guru.

50:35.190 --> 50:36.354
I'm a Guru myself,

50:37.552 --> 50:39.552
and what's the conveyance of a Guru?

50:41.071 --> 50:43.071
What is the animal he keeps? His dog.

50:45.901 --> 50:49.369
And do you know what a dog is? Do you know the qualities of a dog?

50:50.964 --> 50:52.792
He loves his master.

50:54.339 --> 50:55.974
He'll give his life for his Master.

50:58.386 --> 51:01.537
He'll not sleep till he sees his master return back.

51:07.158 --> 51:07.936
Any time!

51:10.180 --> 51:10.850
We had a dog,

51:12.159 --> 51:15.370
and every time I went out, every time

51:15.437 --> 51:18.563
he would come and sit at the door waiting for me.

51:25.747 --> 51:30.011
And some people tried very hard thing on him, some vegetarians

51:31.350 --> 51:34.863
and he was about to die. We put him in the hospital.

51:37.512 --> 51:39.512
When I went there, I sat before him.

51:39.789 --> 51:41.481
He just pulled all his body,

51:42.330 --> 51:46.196
put his head on my feet, and died peacefully.

51:46.783 --> 51:50.045
It's a dog, animal.

51:58.918 --> 52:01.238
When I went away, say, out of

52:02.436 --> 52:04.436
my house, he would not eat food till I came back.

52:05.159 --> 52:07.340
To any other country I went, he would not eat food

52:07.380 --> 52:09.380
for all these days. He would not eat his food,

52:09.768 --> 52:10.429
till I came back.

52:13.746 --> 52:16.675
He would not disturb me, but would sleep outside

52:17.500 --> 52:18.718
waiting for me to get up.

52:26.131 --> 52:29.267
That's a disciple. Unless and until you become good disciples

52:29.366 --> 52:30.749
how are you going to become the gurus?

52:32.470 --> 52:34.178
What's the use of my telling you anything about it?

52:35.190 --> 52:37.079
You don't have any discipline of your own,

52:37.126 --> 52:38.927
how are you going to give discipline to others?

52:40.427 --> 52:43.470
You yourself are tempted into all kinds of things,

52:44.155 --> 52:46.694
how are you going to make others

52:46.774 --> 52:48.960
understand you? What have you got, to become the guru?

52:50.153 --> 52:54.363
What can you give? All the Saints have spent their own money,

52:54.863 --> 52:57.116
all over the world any where it is.

52:59.401 --> 53:01.742
To spread Sahaja Yoga how much money have you spent?

53:04.401 --> 53:08.511
Of your own. How much money have you spent of your own to spread Sahaja Yoga?

53:14.455 --> 53:16.393
They used to starve themselves

53:16.675 --> 53:19.761
to get some. I have spent thousands, you know that very well.

53:19.955 --> 53:23.274
You know for definite how many thousands I have spent on you people.

53:25.289 --> 53:28.075
Even the Puja money that I get, you know, each and every money,

53:28.184 --> 53:31.135
I use it for buying some silver things for you.

53:32.221 --> 53:36.277
It should not be for you, it is for me I should say, but I do it.

53:43.505 --> 53:45.906
Every Saint used to spend money,

53:46.406 --> 53:49.789
Christ had to spend money to spread His Christianity,

53:50.022 --> 53:53.152
He never spread Christianity, His own message.

53:55.115 --> 53:56.369
Tukarama had to do it,

53:57.341 --> 53:59.341
Gyaneshwara had to do it. Whatever they had,

53:59.841 --> 54:02.619
they used that money, whatever they had, to spread

54:04.385 --> 54:08.104
Sahaja Yoga. Why? In Sahaja Yoga,

54:09.296 --> 54:11.943
the greatest thing I notice, everybody is so blessed.

54:13.780 --> 54:16.239
They have nice houses, nice ashrams,

54:16.377 --> 54:18.632
all conveniences, everything so well done.

54:20.705 --> 54:21.623
They are so blessed.

54:23.738 --> 54:27.075
God looks after them, all their problems get solved. They want

54:27.257 --> 54:30.225
marriages, so good marriages are done, everything is done well.

54:32.340 --> 54:34.340
Everything gets sorted out.

54:35.313 --> 54:37.158
Only blessings are there, no duties.

54:44.745 --> 54:46.581
How much money have you spent for Sahaja Yoga?

54:46.785 --> 54:48.634
First of all you should ask a question.

54:49.291 --> 54:50.960
How much time I have given for Sahaja Yoga?

54:51.855 --> 54:53.855
How many people I have given realization to?

54:56.411 --> 54:58.411
How much righteous and virtuous I have been?

55:01.187 --> 55:03.633
What have I done to bring the good name to Sahaja Yoga?

55:04.515 --> 55:06.769
What about my personal behavior, how I have lived?

55:15.519 --> 55:17.519
Arneau has spent lot of money I know,

55:19.349 --> 55:23.333
he and his wife. I know about everyone.

55:31.977 --> 55:33.977
You have to give time, money,

55:35.138 --> 55:37.138
everything, your job,

55:37.487 --> 55:40.065
everything you have to give up. People have given up jobs!

55:40.565 --> 55:42.565
I've told you the stories

55:43.402 --> 55:46.415
how people have sacrificed for ordinary things like

55:46.915 --> 55:48.915
freedom, fighting and all that.

55:53.595 --> 55:55.994
So today, as I told you, you have to resolve

55:56.494 --> 55:58.494
that we are going to have

55:59.789 --> 56:02.611
the growth within ourselves through our Shraddha

56:02.713 --> 56:03.923
and through our surrender.

56:04.980 --> 56:06.980
Only through Meditation you can do it.

56:10.204 --> 56:13.596
“We are all going to grow Mother into this”,

56:14.001 --> 56:17.510
this you have to promise me as I stand before you as a Guru.

56:19.245 --> 56:19.662
Alright?

56:28.329 --> 56:31.256
We'll have the Guru Puja now, not Mother's Puja I don't feel like having.

56:31.611 --> 56:33.611
Let’s start the Guru Puja. Come along.

56:34.633 --> 56:38.780
Bring the water, I have to wash My hands for the Guru Puja

56:50.683 --> 56:54.826
When I say something, you will smile and talk to me, giggle, laugh,

56:54.976 --> 56:56.118
in the program also.

56:57.143 --> 56:58.373
In the church you keep quiet.

56:59.094 --> 57:01.581
If there is a bhoot-of-a-pope sitting, you all keep quiet.

57:08.462 --> 57:12.454
No breeding at all, ill-mannered, badly brought up.

57:23.458 --> 57:25.458
It's better you give me only porcelain one.

57:25.750 --> 57:27.750
/?/

57:30.975 --> 57:32.975
It's like a dog becomes mad, you know.

57:35.347 --> 57:37.796
But such dogs are killed.

57:38.984 --> 57:40.652
They are not kept in the public.

57:46.136 --> 57:47.217
/?/

57:47.717 --> 57:49.717
Such sweet dogs. See one by one.

57:50.217 --> 57:53.944
See now Italians have brought such beautiful dogs for you to see.

57:59.350 --> 58:01.350
/?/

58:20.648 --> 58:25.666
(Sahaja Yogi: Those are the dogs chosen by Shri Mataji herself).

58:25.746 --> 58:27.746
I chose you also.

58:28.713 --> 58:31.994
I've chosen you also. But look at them how sweet they are.

58:34.642 --> 58:37.438
So pleasure giving, so joy giving.

58:40.927 --> 58:42.742
They are so timely they'll absorb

58:43.483 --> 58:46.538
all the anger of the Deities I'm sure,

58:46.629 --> 58:48.081
sitting down here like Deities.

58:49.063 --> 58:49.801
Beautifully.

59:37.455 --> 59:41.119
/?/ that is the one to keep it here, has to bark at people,

59:43.799 --> 59:46.408
for those who do not behave. Turn it out like that.

59:48.826 --> 59:49.802
German dog.

01:00:09.543 --> 01:00:11.543
So sweet they are. Beautiful.

01:00:22.721 --> 01:00:26.072
Do not forgive yourself, forgive others.

01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:31.396
Then you will become gurus.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.276
Life should be such,

01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:39.623
that those who come in close contact with you should feel respect for you,

01:00:41.857 --> 01:00:45.375
that you are so disciplined. You are very disciplined.

01:00:51.602 --> 01:00:54.604
I've seen this. My husband is coming,

01:00:56.054 --> 01:00:58.593
tomorrow, you'll be having program.

01:00:59.963 --> 01:01:02.424
And I've seen one thing about his life,

01:01:02.798 --> 01:01:06.542
one thing, which I have to tell you,

01:01:07.521 --> 01:01:10.966
which has made him such a great man. He's an extremely disciplined man.

01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:12.973
Extremely disciplined.

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:20.671
The one, who does not have discipline,

01:01:20.684 --> 01:01:22.684
is like a dog which is amuck,

01:01:25.347 --> 01:01:27.833
which has got rabies.

01:01:31.117 --> 01:01:33.780
After realization you have to be disciplined people.

01:01:35.771 --> 01:01:41.542
Discipline yourself. This is what I said in 1982, again I'm repeating it.

01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:47.507
But now, the second half of it which I said, I'll tell in India,

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:51.342
which I hope they will send it over to you.
