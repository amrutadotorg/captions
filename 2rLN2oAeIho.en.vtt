00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.915
I believe you all say these things,

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:15.278
and you listen to it,

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.269
and you say it from your heart.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.673
Only the one who are united with God can worship Shri Ganesha.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920
And Shri Ganesha worships your Mother.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510
First of all

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.421
one must to understand

00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:09.034
that there is a combination of a Mother and a Guru.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:14.484
Because Guru is a very hard task master.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
He does not allow any liberties to be taken.

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.325
And Mother is very kindly.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:34.245
But you don't have feelings for the Mother, do you?

00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:50.781
Is it all a lip-service that you listen,

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:54.792
goes into your head, and you think you have become

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.870
the surrendered Sahaja yogis?

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:04.271
Like all Islam people believe they are surrendered to God,

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:07.322
like Christians believe they are surrendered to God.

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:12.103
It's just a lip-service that you are this, you are that.

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:17.858
Or do you know it him, what is said, is a fact.

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:23.695
Have you not seen the Sun in my hand?

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:26.517
What more proof you want?

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:53.166
Anybody who misleads you is of course sinful no doubt,

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.824
but to fall a trap to such a person!

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:05.247
If you had told a child that the Mother is coming, he would have fought,

00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:06.534
"I'm going".

00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:11.994
He would have cried and wept.

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:18.976
What about your vibrations?

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.195
You don't use your vibrations?

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.770
You have come all the way for Guru Puja here,

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:30.143
who is your Guru? Whom are you going to worship?

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:36.217
Anybody comes from anywhere becomes suddenly important. How?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.440
It was never done before,

00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:48.994
first time I see such a horrible thing.

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:55.445
In my living time if you are doing like this, after my death so many gurus will rise,

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.087
to mislead you.

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.389
Are you going to accept all that?

00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:31.727
All the Deities refused for me to do this.

00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:35.482
They tortured my life, they would not accept

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.139
to allow you to have the Puja. Absolutely, nothing doing.

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.684
Because they love me, they respect me.

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.184
They have the proper protocol.

00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:53.241
They don't want to become gurus themselves,

00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:55.741
and misbehave in this manner.

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:18.141
Last time when I came I really was very strong, with the French.

00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:27.565
I've told so many times that France is the Hell of the Universe.

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.465
And you should fall a trap to something like that?

00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:43.207
It's very supra-conscious, extremely supra-conscious.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:45.762
And arrogant.

00:05:56.997 --> 00:06:00.897
I've never known of such a Guru Puja. Never.

00:06:02.448 --> 00:06:05.595
Indians had only one Guru Puja, and they are praying that

00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.682
they should have at least one more Guru Puja.

00:06:10.012 --> 00:06:13.580
With all these Guru Pujas if you have achieved this kind of surrendering,

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:16.871
it's better you do not have any more Guru Pujas at all.

00:06:17.371 --> 00:06:20.154
Don't deserve it. You cannot become Gurus,

00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:21.924
I can see that clearly.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.420
Without surrender how will you?

00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:02.931
All the Blessings of the Divine

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.096
have been showered upon you.

00:07:08.892 --> 00:07:10.892
And what have you given back?

00:07:16.787 --> 00:07:18.787
Such ego?

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:22.538
That you act to somebody because he has greater egos?

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:44.211
It is a very bad example.

00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:55.031
You have to wash the feet of the Indians and drink that water.

00:07:55.531 --> 00:07:58.659
May be then you might realize where you are.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:01.353
You may be very developed and all that.

00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:04.572
And the Indians who are of your type,

00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:08.151
all of them have to do that.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.204
Why didn't you see your vibrations?

00:08:21.028 --> 00:08:24.848
When the blind gets his eyes, he doesn't close his eyes to see things, does he?

00:08:29.498 --> 00:08:31.498
And what has happened to your leaders also?

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.039
All of them put together could not

00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:44.539
say that we will not have this nonsense at this time?

00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:59.700
Just coming to the airport, so many people have risen higher in life.

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:01.930
What are you doing here?

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:10.529
You should have protested.

00:09:13.431 --> 00:09:17.057
I would like to know how many wanted to go to the airport and asked for it.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.277
Raise your hands. Honestly.

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:23.234
Honestly.

00:09:35.178 --> 00:09:37.178
These are the only people who love me.

00:09:41.418 --> 00:09:42.304
May God Bless you.

00:10:02.909 --> 00:10:05.993
Tomorrow somebody tells you to insult me, will you do that?

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:21.567
You know that if a king arrives from a small little place somewhere,

00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:26.651
or a prime minister from a very small island,

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.602
from lardy and muddy island

00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:35.304
the prime minister came,

00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:39.907
and the prime minister of England had to go receive him.

00:10:49.177 --> 00:10:50.824
And if your Guru has come,

00:10:50.927 --> 00:10:52.927
all the gurus have to come to receive me,

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:57.679
or to listen to something nonsensical here?

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.846
I felt like going back from the airport only,

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:07.346
the kind of vibrations I felt.

00:11:12.943 --> 00:11:14.943
How do you get into this kind of a maya?

00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:22.346
How you join hands? Except for a few.

00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:34.411
“Your quality will be known:

00:11:36.417 --> 00:11:39.146
how much you are surrendered to Me".

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.552
Christ has said that.

00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:48.830
And today I say to you that.

00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:55.058
On all other things Sahaja yogis will protest.

00:11:56.121 --> 00:11:58.951
"This was not good, that was not good, this was done”.

00:11:59.069 --> 00:12:01.517
Against each other, against everything they will protest.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:10.094
"Sahaja yogi took this much money from us, and

00:12:10.131 --> 00:12:12.131
this should not have happened," they always tell me.

00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:14.901
Complaints and complaints, and complaints, and complaints!

00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:25.814
And for this kind of a nonsense they have no protest, nothing!

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:39.202
You are all ego-oriented people and you like

00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:41.421
egoistical supra-conscious nonsense.

00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.790
That's what it is.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.193
You have all come for Guru Puja or for what have you come for?

00:12:55.424 --> 00:12:56.448
It is beyond me.

00:13:02.122 --> 00:13:05.363
This I'm talking to you as your Mother, and not as your Guru.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.880
As a Guru I’ll do what I have to do.

00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:15.446
I'm talking to you as a Mother. Is this the way to respect Her?

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.165
I told you, this is the last Guru Puja you'll be having,

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.004
the last Puja you will be having, perhaps may be.

00:13:34.736 --> 00:13:36.736
It's shocking!

00:13:48.158 --> 00:13:50.158
You have to respect your Guru.

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:51.788
Surrender to your Guru.

00:13:53.182 --> 00:13:55.347
It is said that the Guru is

00:13:55.384 --> 00:13:59.070
the Param Chaitanya, but it is: the Param Chaitanya itself is your Guru.

00:14:05.685 --> 00:14:11.159
"Agata Parama Chaitanya, Dhanyoham Tava Dharshan -

00:14:12.756 --> 00:14:15.859
When the Paramchaitanya itself will come on this earth,

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:18.539
I will feel myself so gratified

00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:20.958
to see the darshan of that Maya.

00:14:23.808 --> 00:14:25.808
In what world are you living?

00:14:26.308 --> 00:14:27.277
Where are you?

00:14:30.408 --> 00:14:31.371
Taking for granted?

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.010
I know Mother has a right to punish you, very well.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.939
Even Krishna could be punished by His Mother.

00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:55.231
But I'm not interested.

00:15:01.308 --> 00:15:03.441
The children who want to disrespect me,

00:15:03.577 --> 00:15:05.577
and insult me, I have nothing to do with them.

00:15:09.271 --> 00:15:11.271
They have no love for me, I have nothing to do.

00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:20.057
Only those

00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:24.517
who protested and wanted to go to the airport should come forward to do my Puja.

00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:29.752
Honestly.

00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:40.379
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:15:44.404 --> 00:15:47.220
You have insulted your Mother, who has given you Realization,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.157
who has done so much for you. Selflessly I've been working

00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:53.053
day in and day out,

00:15:58.319 --> 00:16:01.301
neglecting my own children, my own family,

00:16:02.827 --> 00:16:03.769
my grandchildren.

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:05.294
For you?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.995
Only those people who wanted to go to the airport

00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:34.078
and said, and did not go, please come forward.

00:16:36.415 --> 00:16:36.912
Please.

00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:52.745
Come.

00:17:02.363 --> 00:17:04.363
He is meeting Me after so many years.

00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:07.037
When did you come?

00:17:10.913 --> 00:17:11.797
Just imagine,

00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:14.565
they come all the way from here and there, and there.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.399
And nicely you are telling them to listen to some nonsense?

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:20.763
They have not come here to listen to anybody’s nonsense.

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:36.039
Come forward, this side.

00:17:38.856 --> 00:17:41.735
Yes, of course, those who could not come,

00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:43.788
because they arrived late, I told them

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.319
there is no program in the evening.

00:17:48.516 --> 00:17:49.490
All the Spanish,

00:17:50.685 --> 00:17:51.666
how sweet they were.

00:17:53.275 --> 00:17:55.275
Those who were here and did not come,

00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:57.249
otherwise.

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:10.507
/?/

00:18:11.603 --> 00:18:14.127
/?/

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:15.217
When did you come?

00:18:18.183 --> 00:18:18.842
/?/

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:24.701
/?/

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:27.333
/?/

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:30.909
/?/

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:46.004
/?/

00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:54.653
/?/

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.048
Yes, you can come along Swiss people…

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.587
Those who were here and did not come,

00:19:50.444 --> 00:19:53.563
should understand that you are living

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.809
in the Kingdom of God.

00:20:02.066 --> 00:20:06.548
And when the Goddess of that Kingdom arrives,

00:20:07.098 --> 00:20:08.536
you have to be there.

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:26.823
I'm sorry I have to do that,

00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:28.909
this is the promise I had to give to all the Deities.

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:45.508
Know that you have to have all and more,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.100
you have to work hard. You have to meditate.

00:20:50.858 --> 00:20:52.858
Shows, that there is no discipline.

00:21:01.914 --> 00:21:05.272
I will also forgive Austrians, because their leader wanted to go.

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.732
Austrians should be forgiven,

00:21:09.381 --> 00:21:11.381
because their leader wanted to go.

00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:15.619
They could come up too.

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:27.273
One man can save and one man can destroy.

00:21:30.487 --> 00:21:32.801
Your leader is alright till it comes to Mother's point,

00:21:33.301 --> 00:21:35.301
but when you reach that point,

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.390
then, you have to protest against your leader.

00:21:45.285 --> 00:21:47.088
Come along, come, sit here.

00:21:47.191 --> 00:21:48.560
All the rest should go at the back,

00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:51.319
just go at the back.

00:21:54.285 --> 00:21:58.447
Please go back. All others, go back,

00:22:00.734 --> 00:22:01.725
and sit down there.

00:22:06.263 --> 00:22:10.328
I had to promise this. I had to promise this to the Deities.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.560
They would not accept, they would not accept!

00:22:33.168 --> 00:22:36.442
You must know there are Deities and Ganas and everyone is sitting here.

00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:39.805
They came forward before me, to France.

00:22:49.092 --> 00:22:51.624
24 hours they are working, you know that very well.

00:22:51.677 --> 00:22:53.677
You know it, it's not a story. You know that.

00:22:54.326 --> 00:22:57.724
They are working for you, helping you in every way, solving all your problems,

00:22:58.075 --> 00:22:58.547
don't they?

00:23:08.132 --> 00:23:10.132
Gavin also should not do my Puja.

00:23:10.136 --> 00:23:11.322
Because he should have said that.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.568
So Gavin should go back.

00:23:14.409 --> 00:23:16.263
And all the English, who came here early,

00:23:16.472 --> 00:23:18.750
just to attend everything, to attend what, the nonsense?

00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:25.516
Gavin said he did not know, there was going to be a lecture

00:23:25.524 --> 00:23:26.816
otherwise he would of object it.

00:23:27.048 --> 00:23:28.668
But what about coming to the airport_

00:23:36.177 --> 00:23:38.177
English know how much I have worked with them.

00:23:45.474 --> 00:23:48.110
All the leaders who did not protest should also go back.

00:23:56.134 --> 00:23:57.241
All should go.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.898
Those who have not protested.

00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:15.267
Guido you protested?

00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:18.337
Yes, Italians could be there.

00:24:25.192 --> 00:24:26.406
Guido protested,

00:24:26.634 --> 00:24:29.895
he could not understand: what was happening? Where is our Mother?

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:35.936
Come this side. All the rest go at the back.

00:24:40.691 --> 00:24:42.775
What courage is needed for that kind of a thing?

00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:51.744
Of course.

00:24:58.399 --> 00:25:00.413
Otherwise there is a protest for everything,

00:25:00.658 --> 00:25:02.658
every day I'm receiving letters from people:

00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:06.921
"This is not good, that is not working out in Australia,

00:25:06.928 --> 00:25:09.079
is not working out here, that is not happening”.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.370
Everybody has a right to criticize everyone.

00:25:47.182 --> 00:25:50.545
French have been stupid in the past, and they are stupid even now.

00:25:51.492 --> 00:25:52.153
That's what they are,

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.196
think knowing no end of themselves.

00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:57.775
Spanish people were, once upon a time, very aggressive,

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.056
but in Sahaja Yoga they are not like that.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.230
You must learn how to respect.

00:26:13.061 --> 00:26:14.638
You've had no good training.

00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:17.910
“Very bad breeding” - that's what God is going to say about you.

00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:23.973
I've done my level best to tell you how to behave.

00:26:41.581 --> 00:26:43.947
No protocol, any sense of protocol you have.

00:26:46.072 --> 00:26:47.075
It's like beggars.

00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:01.881
Today you have to resolve,

00:27:04.955 --> 00:27:06.955
and ask the forgiveness of all the Deities,

00:27:08.423 --> 00:27:12.744
that you are going to use your vibrations all the time. Resolve.

00:27:14.869 --> 00:27:18.909
And that no more such a thing we are going to repeat again. This is the last,

00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:20.695
never like this.

00:27:21.524 --> 00:27:23.787
I am very suppressed that English,

00:27:23.794 --> 00:27:26.686
they come even in sleet, in snow, this, that.

00:27:26.857 --> 00:27:29.729
And here what happened, as soon as they came to hell they became hellish?

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:33.179
What have happen to the English?

00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:41.065
They have no personality of their own?

00:27:42.533 --> 00:27:46.155
Always they followed the French, and now go with them to the ditch.

00:27:46.655 --> 00:27:49.150
Is that the principle now maintain?

00:27:53.612 --> 00:27:56.104
“French Sahaja yogis said, French Sahaja yogis said”.

00:28:00.584 --> 00:28:03.668
Tomorrow French Sahaja yogi said: “Go and kill your Mother”. We’ll kill it.

00:28:03.912 --> 00:28:04.319
Is it?

00:28:05.988 --> 00:28:07.988
Because French Sahaja yogi have said.

00:28:23.588 --> 00:28:27.529
No individuality, no understanding of anything, stupid.

00:28:29.529 --> 00:28:30.673
/?/

00:28:34.187 --> 00:28:35.042
/?/

00:28:52.734 --> 00:28:53.563
/?/

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.339
/?/

00:29:02.217 --> 00:29:04.830
/?/

00:29:06.633 --> 00:29:08.633
/?/

00:29:10.102 --> 00:29:11.178
/?/

00:29:21.645 --> 00:29:23.645
/?/

00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.265
/?/

00:29:29.613 --> 00:29:32.552
/?/

00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:38.920
This Yashi has come to Me from her childhood.

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:41.208
And as children they used to come all the way.

00:29:41.209 --> 00:29:44.691
Do you know where this Old Delhi is,

00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:46.960
and where her father was working for the university.

00:29:48.137 --> 00:29:52.236
Whether I came at 6 o’clock, or 8 o’clock, or 10 o’clock,

00:29:52.489 --> 00:29:54.489
or in the night of a 12 o’clock.

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:58.391
Her father with all his three daughters used to be there.

00:30:00.688 --> 00:30:03.255
And so much bubbling and joy that Mother has come.

00:30:27.578 --> 00:30:29.578
/?/

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:31.689
/?/

00:30:34.092 --> 00:30:35.157
/?/

00:30:36.238 --> 00:30:38.238
/?/

00:30:39.654 --> 00:30:41.654
/?/

00:30:47.335 --> 00:30:48.655
/?/

00:30:49.155 --> 00:30:51.333
/?/

00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:53.833
/?/

00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:57.725
/?/

00:31:09.573 --> 00:31:13.762
/?/

00:31:26.896 --> 00:31:29.129
/?/

00:31:31.708 --> 00:31:34.845
Many people have not seen me for month together.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.832
Whether you have seen me or not.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.354
As I'm angry with you,

00:31:52.365 --> 00:31:54.365
also I'm pleased with some people,

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.087
those who have love for me.

00:32:06.653 --> 00:32:10.899
And as a symbol of that I want to give this ring to Guido.

00:32:37.425 --> 00:32:40.173
What surprises me, the gurus who lynch you,

00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:46.373
the one who wanted this,

00:32:50.291 --> 00:32:53.442
Rolls Royce. They starved themselves for one year,

00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:55.538
bought a Rolls Royce,

00:33:00.866 --> 00:33:03.571
and went to receive him, and such a crowd

00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:05.807
that people could not get to the airport.

00:33:06.624 --> 00:33:08.624
That sort of a guru you need,

00:33:09.882 --> 00:33:11.882
who'll take you to hell!

00:33:17.175 --> 00:33:19.175
You don't want to go to heaven.

00:33:19.675 --> 00:33:22.946
You don't want to be the citizen of God's realm.

00:33:53.419 --> 00:33:54.848
Now whatever mantra you say,

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:58.121
please listen.

00:33:59.749 --> 00:34:01.749
Put it in your heads what you are talking.

00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:08.805
What you are saying from your lips, listen.

00:34:09.939 --> 00:34:12.255
Put it in your heart what you are saying.

00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:17.549
Don't be hypocrites.

00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:26.062
No explanation is needed.

00:34:26.174 --> 00:34:29.338
"I've been to a guru, I've done this, I've done"- nothing of the kind.

00:34:33.098 --> 00:34:35.098
Even if at this stage, after so many days,

00:34:36.303 --> 00:34:39.380
if you have not realized that whatever we believe into

00:34:40.972 --> 00:34:42.054
should be

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.580
part and parcel of ourselves.

00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:46.833
I mean these wretched people like

00:34:46.875 --> 00:34:48.768
Christians and other people, these

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.582
Hindus and Muslims and all that,

00:34:50.677 --> 00:34:53.474
they've not seen God, they've not got realization, nothing

00:34:53.674 --> 00:34:55.902
but to them it becomes a faith, they fight for it.

00:34:57.213 --> 00:34:59.972
And for you people who have seen the reality - it is not,

00:35:01.283 --> 00:35:02.428
what's wrong with me?

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:16.684
People are afraid of the police, afraid of this.

00:35:16.743 --> 00:35:18.743
You have entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:20.138
You have seen what has happened

00:35:21.607 --> 00:35:24.446
with people who have tried to trouble me.

00:35:32.558 --> 00:35:33.626
Aren't you afraid of that?

00:35:45.227 --> 00:35:46.574
Don't become frivolous:

00:35:48.572 --> 00:35:51.411
"What was there to go to the airport, after all doesn't matter".

00:35:55.682 --> 00:35:57.808
All the Ganas went there, with me.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.374
They have all noted down, and they are here too.

00:36:07.962 --> 00:36:11.060
I am so cautiously taking you out, because you don't see them.

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:12.873
But you'll see them very soon.

00:36:22.818 --> 00:36:25.436
It's not easy to control them also, you must know that.

00:36:26.993 --> 00:36:29.242
I do not control you, neither I control them.

00:36:38.993 --> 00:36:43.362
So now, I don't want to be unkind to people

00:36:43.757 --> 00:36:46.971
who have been desiring to come and see me, who love me so much.

00:36:48.493 --> 00:36:52.085
And I want to forgive you all, all of you,

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.990
because this was the first mistake.

00:37:19.913 --> 00:37:22.442
Nobody should fix my program without asking me.

00:37:23.523 --> 00:37:25.034
Nobody should take such liberties.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.554
From next time I will not do anything of the kind,

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.898
I'm telling you very clearly!

00:37:30.696 --> 00:37:32.696
You fix my program, and I'll let you down!

00:37:34.023 --> 00:37:36.371
Without asking me you are not to fix me anywhere.

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:43.524
Without taking my permission, written permission.

00:37:45.612 --> 00:37:48.938
If you ever try to do such tricks with me, I'll put you right.

00:37:55.028 --> 00:37:58.494
You know I have all the powers to correct you.

00:38:02.533 --> 00:38:04.533
Don't take liberties with me anymore.

00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:06.252
I'm telling you, I am warning you.

00:38:09.795 --> 00:38:11.795
Try to understand, you are facing

00:38:13.138 --> 00:38:15.420
Someone, Who has all the Powers.

00:38:22.122 --> 00:38:22.883
You know that,

00:38:25.384 --> 00:38:28.105
know well, within yourself.

00:38:32.657 --> 00:38:36.452
It's not even like Mohammad. Mohammad just talked.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.430
He never gave realization,

00:38:41.977 --> 00:38:42.723
He warned.

00:38:44.464 --> 00:38:45.826
None of them, none of them.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:51.847
But after seeing, none of them have photographs as you have seen of mine.

00:38:51.926 --> 00:38:52.492
Have they?

00:39:01.562 --> 00:39:04.228
What more proof you want to know what I am.

00:39:06.099 --> 00:39:08.099
Now behave yourself. I'm warning you!

00:39:10.188 --> 00:39:10.964
Mahamaya -

00:39:14.128 --> 00:39:16.128
the other side of it is horrible.

00:39:17.687 --> 00:39:18.344
Be careful.

00:39:25.917 --> 00:39:27.013
Only for those

00:39:28.728 --> 00:39:30.728
who are my children I come on this earth.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.111
Not for those who are not,

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.450
I've nothing to do with them.

00:39:44.553 --> 00:39:45.566
I did try

00:39:46.253 --> 00:39:48.331
to save you, as a prodigal son has to be saved,

00:39:48.426 --> 00:39:50.426
that's different. That's very different.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.628
But don't take liberties with me, I must tell you and warn you.

00:40:26.283 --> 00:40:28.264
I do not need any. The heat is just

00:40:29.465 --> 00:40:30.506
drying up everything.

00:40:46.732 --> 00:40:49.505
I feel like a Mother who is insulted, abused,

00:40:50.254 --> 00:40:52.254
ill-treated by her own children.

00:40:57.814 --> 00:40:59.526
You can take interest from others,

00:40:59.548 --> 00:41:01.655
not from your own children. You cannot.

00:41:02.049 --> 00:41:03.253
Very difficult.

00:41:11.549 --> 00:41:13.462
If you do not understand any protocol,

00:41:13.809 --> 00:41:15.040
because you are so naive,

00:41:15.425 --> 00:41:18.116
you have never known anything, you don't know how to respect.

00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:23.607
Then you better learn it.

00:41:32.276 --> 00:41:33.200
There is no Shraddha,

00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:37.455
because it was never there. You don't know how to respect anyone.

00:41:38.828 --> 00:41:41.552
You only have respect for yourself, perhaps may not be that even.

00:41:54.248 --> 00:41:58.925
Today is a day of a very great event.

00:42:02.544 --> 00:42:03.221
And

00:42:06.706 --> 00:42:11.331
“Guru" is a word as I told you, comes from the word "Gravity".

00:42:14.341 --> 00:42:17.283
The gravity. And the gravity,

00:42:18.422 --> 00:42:21.526
that's what I felt, that I have no gravity to attract you people.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.923
Or you people have no weight at all in you, that I should gravitate you.

00:42:35.548 --> 00:42:37.548
Anything that has weight

00:42:40.261 --> 00:42:43.832
gravitates, automatically.

00:42:46.575 --> 00:42:50.261
It does not gravitate towards itself, but it gravitates.

00:42:53.063 --> 00:42:56.705
There's also gravity between the matter.

00:42:59.849 --> 00:43:04.661
But what it has towards Mother Earth is incomparable.

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.617
You throw any stone out, it comes back.

00:43:15.162 --> 00:43:17.162
Impossible to fight the gravity.

00:43:22.252 --> 00:43:26.656
And that gravity is the integration

00:43:27.423 --> 00:43:29.423
of your Shraddha,

00:43:30.755 --> 00:43:32.875
of your Dedication, and your surrender.

00:43:45.569 --> 00:43:50.640
Without that gravity you cannot nourish yourself, you cannot grow.

00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:54.299
Just imagine, the roots

00:43:56.403 --> 00:43:58.403
go towards the gravity.

00:44:00.195 --> 00:44:03.285
And when they are nourished, then only, the tree rises above.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.098
If your roots are not deep, if your roots are so flimsy,

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.179
you cannot go down.

00:44:15.318 --> 00:44:17.948
Unless you go down in that gravity,

00:44:19.533 --> 00:44:20.382
you cannot come up.

00:44:22.174 --> 00:44:23.328
You cannot nourish yourself.

00:44:23.632 --> 00:44:25.853
Now my talk should not be a waste again.

00:44:26.353 --> 00:44:27.267
Please listen to me.

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:31.323
I'm addressing to you, all of you. Remember that.

00:44:33.193 --> 00:44:36.416
Do not think that I'm addressing to somebody else. It is to you all.

00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:42.237
So the only way one can ascend in Sahaja Yoga is through

00:44:42.737 --> 00:44:43.607
putting the roots down.

00:44:44.498 --> 00:44:46.052
Allow the roots to grow.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.166
Unless and until roots grow, the tree cannot grow.

00:44:50.199 --> 00:44:53.199
I have seen many Sahaja yogis who talk big about Sahaja Yoga,

00:44:53.209 --> 00:44:55.672
they can write books, they can write things.

00:44:55.858 --> 00:44:59.060
The other day I saw somebody writing a big pamphlet about Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:00.104 --> 00:45:01.403
nothing inside the person!

00:45:06.861 --> 00:45:08.401
That's not the sign of a Sahaja yogi.

00:45:08.737 --> 00:45:11.292
A Sahaja yogi has to gravitate inside.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:15.097
How do we do it?

00:45:16.946 --> 00:45:22.190
In the year 1982 I told you the eightfold ways of doing it,

00:45:22.198 --> 00:45:23.700
and I said: I will tell you later.

00:45:24.984 --> 00:45:26.984
And I was about to tell you. But not now,

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.165
there are other eight ways by which you can rise.

00:45:34.868 --> 00:45:39.088
Because, you are not yet grounded in Sahaja Yoga, you are not yet grounded.

00:45:45.093 --> 00:45:48.214
I thought you would be grounded, you're not.

00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:52.665
You have to nourish

00:45:54.787 --> 00:45:59.198
the other way around. The roots are in the head,

00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:09.441
by becoming thoughtless, by not making the cells to think.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.968
By resting them, by peace within. It is not a show of a peace,

00:46:17.614 --> 00:46:21.916
or just some people look very peaceful for a show.

00:46:22.726 --> 00:46:24.726
You have to work it out here in your head.

00:46:26.721 --> 00:46:28.721
The grounding - it has to go into your awareness.

00:46:32.211 --> 00:46:34.211
How? - Meditation.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.680
There's no discipline I'm told.

00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:42.458
Hounslow, I'm told, there's no discipline of any kind.

00:46:43.104 --> 00:46:45.306
I'm surprised Hounslow people have no discipline

00:46:45.478 --> 00:46:47.607
of getting up early in the morning and doing meditation.

00:46:53.722 --> 00:46:54.436
What are you doing?

00:46:57.853 --> 00:46:58.938
How are you going to grow?

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:05.013
How does the tree grow? It does not grow in the day time.

00:47:06.224 --> 00:47:09.234
It grows in the morning, early in the morning, you never see that.

00:47:15.877 --> 00:47:18.249
How these roots are going to grow into the head?

00:47:19.114 --> 00:47:23.858
Into your brain, into that Jada (gross).

00:47:27.913 --> 00:47:31.461
You have to meditate. That's the only way you can do it.

00:47:31.724 --> 00:47:35.021
Those who do not meditate will become superficial.

00:47:36.341 --> 00:47:38.692
They'll not achieve anything, they create problems /?/.

00:47:39.575 --> 00:47:42.448
If they are right sided, they'll become supra-conscious, they'll become bhoots.

00:47:43.714 --> 00:47:46.425
If they are left-sided, they'll become left sided they will be thrown out!

00:47:46.466 --> 00:47:48.306
You've seen it, in the Sistine Chapel,

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.724
you see Christ throwing them out one by one.

00:47:51.777 --> 00:47:55.225
And then you should not blame me. Just listening to me is not sufficient.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:00.812
It must grow. Actualization of the growth of the thing is needed.

00:48:00.951 --> 00:48:01.705
Do you follow that?

00:48:06.784 --> 00:48:09.920
You've read all kinds of nonsensical things before.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.649
All kinds of horrid things, I know what you have read.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.353
You have read in this horrible French country all kinds of

00:48:19.694 --> 00:48:21.001
sadists, like Sade,

00:48:24.446 --> 00:48:26.095
or Sade whatever you call him.

00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:30.244
And there were many like this,

00:48:31.456 --> 00:48:32.925
who wrote horrible books for you,

00:48:33.425 --> 00:48:35.425
which you have read. But they have not read "Advent".

00:48:35.925 --> 00:48:37.925
How many Sahaja yogis who have not yet read "Advent"?

00:48:39.499 --> 00:48:42.790
But only reading is not going to help, it must go into your brain.

00:48:43.806 --> 00:48:46.646
And brain means what? Into your Central Nervous System.

00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:49.355
Brain doesn't mean in the thinking.

00:48:50.078 --> 00:48:52.373
Into your central nervous system, into

00:48:53.836 --> 00:48:56.031
the cells of your central nervous system.

00:48:58.512 --> 00:49:00.512
That light has to come into the cells.

00:49:03.775 --> 00:49:05.775
You have to grow and grow, and grow!

00:49:11.173 --> 00:49:13.665
There's only way left out for you to go to Himalayas,

00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:17.309
and not to any Ashram or any place.

00:49:18.172 --> 00:49:20.506
But settle down somewhere where you don't eat anything

00:49:20.573 --> 00:49:23.666
or do anything, and take another birth. That's the only way I think.

00:49:30.822 --> 00:49:33.100
We can work it out, not difficult.

00:49:36.628 --> 00:49:38.628
If you have the seeking within your heart,

00:49:40.635 --> 00:49:42.024
and if you have understanding,

00:49:42.105 --> 00:49:44.049
sense, intelligence to understand that

00:49:44.061 --> 00:49:46.870
you have achieved something in life, you can do it.

00:49:50.286 --> 00:49:51.339
You all can do it.

00:49:56.067 --> 00:49:58.438
We don't forgive others, we forgive ourselves.

00:49:58.464 --> 00:49:59.955
This is the worst thing that we do.

00:50:01.906 --> 00:50:03.906
We all the time try to forgive others,

00:50:05.662 --> 00:50:06.708
that's the best way

00:50:09.455 --> 00:50:11.780
to work it out. But no, we try

00:50:13.215 --> 00:50:16.092
to forgive ourselves all the time and not to forgive others.

00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:19.639
Everything you do the other way around.

00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:25.704
We are Sahaja yogis. We're yogis, Saints.

00:50:28.771 --> 00:50:32.109
So, you have to be the guru.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.354
I'm a Guru myself,

00:50:37.552 --> 00:50:39.552
and what's the conveyance of a Guru?

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:43.071
What is the animal he keeps? His dog.

00:50:45.901 --> 00:50:49.369
And do you know what a dog is? Do you know the qualities of a dog?

00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:52.792
He loves his master.

00:50:54.339 --> 00:50:55.974
He'll give his life for his Master.

00:50:58.386 --> 00:51:01.537
He'll not sleep till he sees his master return back.

00:51:07.158 --> 00:51:07.936
Any time!

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:10.850
We had a dog,

00:51:12.159 --> 00:51:15.370
and every time I went out, every time

00:51:15.437 --> 00:51:18.563
he would come and sit at the door waiting for me.

00:51:25.747 --> 00:51:30.011
And some people tried very hard thing on him, some vegetarians

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.863
and he was about to die. We put him in the hospital.

00:51:37.512 --> 00:51:39.512
When I went there, I sat before him.

00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:41.481
He just pulled all his body,

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:46.196
put his head on my feet, and died peacefully.

00:51:46.783 --> 00:51:50.045
It's a dog, animal.

00:51:58.918 --> 00:52:01.238
When I went away, say, out of

00:52:02.436 --> 00:52:04.436
my house, he would not eat food till I came back.

00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:07.340
To any other country I went, he would not eat food

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.380
for all these days. He would not eat his food,

00:52:09.768 --> 00:52:10.429
till I came back.

00:52:13.746 --> 00:52:16.675
He would not disturb me, but would sleep outside

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.718
waiting for me to get up.

00:52:26.131 --> 00:52:29.267
That's a disciple. Unless and until you become good disciples

00:52:29.366 --> 00:52:30.749
how are you going to become the gurus?

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:34.178
What's the use of my telling you anything about it?

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.079
You don't have any discipline of your own,

00:52:37.126 --> 00:52:38.927
how are you going to give discipline to others?

00:52:40.427 --> 00:52:43.470
You yourself are tempted into all kinds of things,

00:52:44.155 --> 00:52:46.694
how are you going to make others

00:52:46.774 --> 00:52:48.960
understand you? What have you got, to become the guru?

00:52:50.153 --> 00:52:54.363
What can you give? All the Saints have spent their own money,

00:52:54.863 --> 00:52:57.116
all over the world any where it is.

00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:01.742
To spread Sahaja Yoga how much money have you spent?

00:53:04.401 --> 00:53:08.511
Of your own. How much money have you spent of your own to spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:53:14.455 --> 00:53:16.393
They used to starve themselves

00:53:16.675 --> 00:53:19.761
to get some. I have spent thousands, you know that very well.

00:53:19.955 --> 00:53:23.274
You know for definite how many thousands I have spent on you people.

00:53:25.289 --> 00:53:28.075
Even the Puja money that I get, you know, each and every money,

00:53:28.184 --> 00:53:31.135
I use it for buying some silver things for you.

00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:36.277
It should not be for you, it is for me I should say, but I do it.

00:53:43.505 --> 00:53:45.906
Every Saint used to spend money,

00:53:46.406 --> 00:53:49.789
Christ had to spend money to spread His Christianity,

00:53:50.022 --> 00:53:53.152
He never spread Christianity, His own message.

00:53:55.115 --> 00:53:56.369
Tukarama had to do it,

00:53:57.341 --> 00:53:59.341
Gyaneshwara had to do it. Whatever they had,

00:53:59.841 --> 00:54:02.619
they used that money, whatever they had, to spread

00:54:04.385 --> 00:54:08.104
Sahaja Yoga. Why? In Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:09.296 --> 00:54:11.943
the greatest thing I notice, everybody is so blessed.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.239
They have nice houses, nice ashrams,

00:54:16.377 --> 00:54:18.632
all conveniences, everything so well done.

00:54:20.705 --> 00:54:21.623
They are so blessed.

00:54:23.738 --> 00:54:27.075
God looks after them, all their problems get solved. They want

00:54:27.257 --> 00:54:30.225
marriages, so good marriages are done, everything is done well.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.340
Everything gets sorted out.

00:54:35.313 --> 00:54:37.158
Only blessings are there, no duties.

00:54:44.745 --> 00:54:46.581
How much money have you spent for Sahaja Yoga?

00:54:46.785 --> 00:54:48.634
First of all you should ask a question.

00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:50.960
How much time I have given for Sahaja Yoga?

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:53.855
How many people I have given realization to?

00:54:56.411 --> 00:54:58.411
How much righteous and virtuous I have been?

00:55:01.187 --> 00:55:03.633
What have I done to bring the good name to Sahaja Yoga?

00:55:04.515 --> 00:55:06.769
What about my personal behavior, how I have lived?

00:55:15.519 --> 00:55:17.519
Arneau has spent lot of money I know,

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:23.333
he and his wife. I know about everyone.

00:55:31.977 --> 00:55:33.977
You have to give time, money,

00:55:35.138 --> 00:55:37.138
everything, your job,

00:55:37.487 --> 00:55:40.065
everything you have to give up. People have given up jobs!

00:55:40.565 --> 00:55:42.565
I've told you the stories

00:55:43.402 --> 00:55:46.415
how people have sacrificed for ordinary things like

00:55:46.915 --> 00:55:48.915
freedom, fighting and all that.

00:55:53.595 --> 00:55:55.994
So today, as I told you, you have to resolve

00:55:56.494 --> 00:55:58.494
that we are going to have

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:02.611
the growth within ourselves through our Shraddha

00:56:02.713 --> 00:56:03.923
and through our surrender.

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.980
Only through Meditation you can do it.

00:56:10.204 --> 00:56:13.596
“We are all going to grow Mother into this”,

00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:17.510
this you have to promise me as I stand before you as a Guru.

00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:19.662
Alright?

00:56:28.329 --> 00:56:31.256
We'll have the Guru Puja now, not Mother's Puja I don't feel like having.

00:56:31.611 --> 00:56:33.611
Let’s start the Guru Puja. Come along.

00:56:34.633 --> 00:56:38.780
Bring the water, I have to wash My hands for the Guru Puja

00:56:50.683 --> 00:56:54.826
When I say something, you will smile and talk to me, giggle, laugh,

00:56:54.976 --> 00:56:56.118
in the program also.

00:56:57.143 --> 00:56:58.373
In the church you keep quiet.

00:56:59.094 --> 00:57:01.581
If there is a bhoot-of-a-pope sitting, you all keep quiet.

00:57:08.462 --> 00:57:12.454
No breeding at all, ill-mannered, badly brought up.

00:57:23.458 --> 00:57:25.458
It's better you give me only porcelain one.

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.750
/?/

00:57:30.975 --> 00:57:32.975
It's like a dog becomes mad, you know.

00:57:35.347 --> 00:57:37.796
But such dogs are killed.

00:57:38.984 --> 00:57:40.652
They are not kept in the public.

00:57:46.136 --> 00:57:47.217
/?/

00:57:47.717 --> 00:57:49.717
Such sweet dogs. See one by one.

00:57:50.217 --> 00:57:53.944
See now Italians have brought such beautiful dogs for you to see.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:01.350
/?/

00:58:20.648 --> 00:58:25.666
(Sahaja Yogi: Those are the dogs chosen by Shri Mataji herself).

00:58:25.746 --> 00:58:27.746
I chose you also.

00:58:28.713 --> 00:58:31.994
I've chosen you also. But look at them how sweet they are.

00:58:34.642 --> 00:58:37.438
So pleasure giving, so joy giving.

00:58:40.927 --> 00:58:42.742
They are so timely they'll absorb

00:58:43.483 --> 00:58:46.538
all the anger of the Deities I'm sure,

00:58:46.629 --> 00:58:48.081
sitting down here like Deities.

00:58:49.063 --> 00:58:49.801
Beautifully.

00:59:37.455 --> 00:59:41.119
/?/ that is the one to keep it here, has to bark at people,

00:59:43.799 --> 00:59:46.408
for those who do not behave. Turn it out like that.

00:59:48.826 --> 00:59:49.802
German dog.

01:00:09.543 --> 01:00:11.543
So sweet they are. Beautiful.

01:00:22.721 --> 01:00:26.072
Do not forgive yourself, forgive others.

01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:31.396
Then you will become gurus.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.276
Life should be such,

01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:39.623
that those who come in close contact with you should feel respect for you,

01:00:41.857 --> 01:00:45.375
that you are so disciplined. You are very disciplined.

01:00:51.602 --> 01:00:54.604
I've seen this. My husband is coming,

01:00:56.054 --> 01:00:58.593
tomorrow, you'll be having program.

01:00:59.963 --> 01:01:02.424
And I've seen one thing about his life,

01:01:02.798 --> 01:01:06.542
one thing, which I have to tell you,

01:01:07.521 --> 01:01:10.966
which has made him such a great man. He's an extremely disciplined man.

01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:12.973
Extremely disciplined.

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:20.671
The one, who does not have discipline,

01:01:20.684 --> 01:01:22.684
is like a dog which is amuck,

01:01:25.347 --> 01:01:27.833
which has got rabies.

01:01:31.117 --> 01:01:33.780
After realization you have to be disciplined people.

01:01:35.771 --> 01:01:41.542
Discipline yourself. This is what I said in 1982, again I'm repeating it.

01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:47.507
But now, the second half of it which I said, I'll tell in India,

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:51.342
which I hope they will send it over to you.
