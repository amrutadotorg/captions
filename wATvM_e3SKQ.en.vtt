00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.480
Better?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.800
Good.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.440
You came before, did you, no?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:26.880
So to continue with the same topic we had,
about the infrastructure of a human being,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.360
about which I told you, that God has made
this infrastructure very beautifully.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.600
Even in nature if you see

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.200
anything that is living, see a tree if
you look at the tree, you’ll be amazed,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:03.200
how the different channels that takes the
sap upwards are so beautifully placed that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.840
there’s no problem for water to rise.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.680
The suction in the water takes place because
the sun shines and the water is sucked in.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.800
The nature is so nicely built
up, absolutely harmonious.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.200
When it is winter time the leaves drop out
because the Mother Earth requires the nutrition

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.320
and the leaves are not getting so much of
sunshine, so there should be less surface exposed.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.920
The same nutrition is taken up again,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.120
and again, in the spring, you find again
the beautiful leaves breaking through.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.040
It’s so beautifully worked out, the whole

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.360
situation, the whole Universe is so
beautifully made, and the infrastructure

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.240
is so made that it receives all the blessings
of the Divine without any difficulty.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.840
It rains and the nature receives it.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.440
If you’ve ever been to a forest, to a densest
forest that you could think of, you’ll be

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:09.680
amazed how clean it is; and the fragrance of
that place is so clean, nothing stagnates.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.200
How it operates and how it works out through
sunshine, through rain, through wind.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.520
In this whole Universe,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.840
now man is created, which is a problem.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.760
The infrastructure of man can be
ruined by him; it’s only he can do it.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.840
The trees cannot ruin themselves, can they?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.760
They stand up like witnesses,
they just give, just give.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.160
Even when they die they give their wood.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.640
When they live they give their flowers,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.520
they give their shade, they give their beauty,
they are giving, giving, giving, all the time.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.480
And the one who takes is this great
epitome of creation – the human being.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.680
He’s the recipient of all that.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.080
Then, he has got intelligence to receive

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.960
everything from that and to
use it for one’s own purpose.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:50.400
That’s how we are exploiting – I would
say exploiting – the blessings of nature.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.560
That’s good, that’s what God wanted that we
should really have the blessings of nature; that

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:13.360
you are the monarchs of this Universe, so [that]
everything stands in attention for your needs.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.320
While man, on his own,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.800
goes mad with his extreme behaviour.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.040
He doesn’t think of his
infrastructure which he can ruin.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.240
The problem is, only the man can ruin that;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.760
not only that but also the outer
structure which is the atmosphere.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.600
You send one man to a forest, it’s alright.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.080
If you send two hundred tigers
to a forest, it’s alright.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:05.840
But if you send ten men to a forest –
finished! All the beauty is finished.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.440
On one side, the sense of beauty,
only human beings have got.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.560
The sense of understanding cleanliness
only human beings have got.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.160
So they are the only enjoyers, they
are the only enjoyers of all this.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.080
They are supposed to enjoy all
this but there is something lacking

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.560
in them which doesn’t give the full enjoyment.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:53.200
When you look at a tree – today cherry blossom
everywhere – then the thought starts coming,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.040
“How much they must have paid for this tree?

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.200
How many years it must have taken?” All these
mundane type of questions come to your mind.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:21.200
But supposing, by any chance, if no thoughts
come into your mind, you just see, witness, could

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:29.840
witness, then the joy that they are trying to give
you and express would be complete within yourself.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:43.840
That state we have not yet achieved: Always we
have thoughts, thoughts which are all artificial.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.240
Thoughts that make you

00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:02.800
some sort of a imaginary person or, if you don’t
go to the subtler side, a very gross person.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.640
It’s not reality.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.320
Imagination is not Reality
and also the grossness is not.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.480
Like a poet might say that, “What a flower is
there and its beautiful,” and that and that.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:25.840
And all sort of stories he may build up about
a flower, and a person who is not imaginary

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:35.200
might say, “I don’t know how much it will cost,
how to put it down, what is the use of this,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.840
how it can be economic."

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.480
Poetry is, of course, touches,
subtler side of life, no doubt.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.080
And thank God Hampstead had so many great poets.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.400
But still is imaginary for other people.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.640
What you look at, and you think,
may not be true for others.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.400
For example a person like Blake, who
wrote all poetry, nobody understood Him.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.240
To understand Him also you
have to have Realisation

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.840
otherwise you can’t understand Him at all.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.360
So, whatever is rendered, on
gross level or on imaginary level,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:36.000
by the nature, cannot be enjoyed by human
beings to its full extent, cannot be.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.720
We think so.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.680
Look at the economic laws as they are that
– “Wants in general are not satiable."

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.200
Means that’s not satisfying at all.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.400
I mean it says, it confesses.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.720
Today you want to have a car?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.080
Alright, you have a car.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.440
Then you want to have an aeroplane?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.880
Alright, you have an aeroplane.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.880
Then you want to have some sort of a thing.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.480
There’s no end to it.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:12.560
So it proves that the joy that you get out
of material things also are not satisfying.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.880
Because at the state at which
human beings are they cannot enjoy.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.240
They cannot enjoy anything, though
they are supposed to enjoy everything,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.200
because they only have the capacity to enjoy.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.720
But there is something lacking in them
by which they cannot enjoy anything.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.560
And what is that quality?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.240
What is that state?

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:50.960
Because the connection for extracting
joy has to be with the Spirit.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.040
Spirit is the connection which emits joy.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.480
There’s no other way to
enjoy life without remorse.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.080
To be connected,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:18.960
first, with Spirit is the only way that we
enjoy because joy doesn’t have double side.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.640
Like people go for a ballroom dancing.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.640
Supposed to be enjoying.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.080
They come home and a big fight starts with them.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:37.440
God knows what they have enjoyed for!
The enjoyment of life is only possible

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.720
if we could get connected to the Spirit.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.600
And that connection to the Spirit,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:56.560
is only possible if you sprout
into that, you become the Spirit.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.320
As Christ has said in very simple
words that, “You are to be born again."

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.840
Very simple.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.080
Looks very simple.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.840
But how?

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.880
You are to be baptised, but how?

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.960
Say I go to a theosophical college or
some sort of a college and they say,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.840
“Now you have got a right to baptise."

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.720
Now to any intelligent man
does it appeal that way?

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.680
Can it be possible?

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:38.400
Baptism, if it’s a living process, in which you
have to get connected, connected with the Spirit,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.920
then what do you do about it?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.840
That means you have to achieve a state
of mind, where you become the Spirit.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.080
That connection has to be established.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:05.840
If that connection is not established, then you
cannot be a twice-born by certifying yourself.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.280
I have seen many people they
said, “Mother, I am twice-born."

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.840
I said, “How do you say you are twice-born?”

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:21.280
“What is the certificate you have got of being
twice-born?” You cannot just certify yourself.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.040
This is not a self-certification.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.520
Supposing a dog says: “I am a human being."

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.240
Will you accept?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:35.920
No, I mean, he can go about, he can go
about and say that, “I am a human being."

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.920
But he doesn’t become.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:48.000
It’s a state, is a quality, which
is, in evolution, has to be shown.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.520
It’s an evolutionary quality.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.520
A fish, which has to become a
tortoise has to become a tortoise.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.360
She can’t just say that, “Oh! I am a tortoise.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.920
Oh! I am a tortoise."

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.760
This is where human ego comes in.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.680
By saying something you do not become.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:23.440
And this is one of the basic things we must know,
that we have to become in actuality, in reality.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.760
We have to face up to it.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.680
And not believing in something because it is said.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.680
Anybody can say anything, what does it matter?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.560
You see, you raise this tongue and put it
under your palate and say what you like!

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.840
What does it take to write a book?

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.080
You take some printer and you give him
something to write, you can write any trash,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.840
any thing so-called, you can write
about God, this, that and talk big,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.280
give sermons, have big organisations
– but it’s nothing of the kind.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.480
Even supposing you have some animals,
like dogs specially, I would say that.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.040
Now you make them dress up like

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.040
little babies and this and that, make them
dance and in a circus you might find they may

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.640
become little bit like human beings, they might
carry letters or may bring your children from the

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.920
school – I mean they can do lots of such things –
but will you call them human beings by any chance?

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:42.320
I’m not saying the difference is so much
but one has to understand one thing:

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.040
that we have not yet become the Spirit.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:54.320
In all humility, let us accept this
fact that we have to become the Spirit.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.960
Now, supposing that is the only source of joy,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.160
if that is your real property within you,
if that is the thing you have to achieve,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.840
supposing for that you have become a human
being, then must you not all do that?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.120
It’s logical that life has no
meaning without it, you see.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.920
You make a candle and you put a wick in that and
do everything with it and when there is darkness,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:31.680
you say, “What are we to do now?”
Enlighten that light! It’s so simple.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.360
The whole Existence itself will have no
meaning if we do not become the Spirit.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.760
We all have to become the
Spirit otherwise we are useless.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.360
We are good for nothing.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.080
Our lives has no meaning.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:59.360
Now when somebody says like that, I could be
another what you call hypocrite, or could be what

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.600
you call them false, fake guru, I could be
like that myself, telling you big stories.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.560
Could be possible.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:07.680
Alright?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.160
Anybody could be like that.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.840
But why cheat yourself, is the point.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.960
Let anybody try to cheat you,
but you don’t cheat yourself.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:31.840
You accept one simple point that you have
to become the Spirit, in all humility,

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:45.840
and that is one wish a seeker should have.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.760
I have known seekers, they
try all kinds of things.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.760
Like a gentleman had a very
bad this centre and asked him,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.440
“What have you been doing?” He
said, “There’s some Rompashompa man.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.600
He’s written some books, of the
third eye and I’m going to operate,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.600
and my third eye is going to come out."

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.840
I said, “What?

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.760
Who has told you that?” He said,
“There are books after books on this."

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.960
I said, “Really?” And how dare
this fellow do that thing.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.840
By operating here if you get
the third eye…(laughing).

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.320
And he was doing all kinds of nonsensical
things believing in that man, and his,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.840
this centre itself was ruined.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.960
I said, “But see the fellow what is he doing
himself?” You see, that’s the best part of it.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.520
You see God has given us
not only brains, but wisdom.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:54.240
God has given us wisdom and we should
use that wisdom, and judge these people

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.960
on these lines to see what they are telling us.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.200
Most of them are ruining your infrastructure.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.240
I would not care for anyone of them
if they were just smuggling money

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.760
or making you poor, doesn’t matter,
in the Kingdom of God, doesn’t matter.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.200
Alright, if they want money, give them
away – finished! There are many smugglers,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.200
thugs and robbers and swindlers.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.440
All sorts of people are in this world, you see.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.720
There are thousand and one words to describe them.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.320
But they are spoiling your
infrastructure is the problem.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.160
And when they spoil that infrastructure,

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:40.320
then this happening of Kundalini
awakening takes time, there’s the problem.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.000
People develop diseases, they develop

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.480
emotional problems, mental problems, all
kinds of problems with all these things.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.640
Actually you must know that, if you are a seeker,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:06.000
and if you seek, you have to
become absolutely a normal person.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.240
All your abnormalities must drop out.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:19.840
If they don’t drop out then you should know
that you still have some horns coming out!

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.120
But people don’t understand that
being abnormal is (means) going down.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.880
Anybody who thinks that he can paint his hair, or
wear a funny dress, walk about, he’ll achieve God,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.720
I don’t know how to tell them
that this is not the way.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:49.840
Or anybody who thinks that [if] he behaves in
a funny manner or shouts and screams and says

00:20:49.840 --> 00:21:01.840
the prayers very loudly on the street and do all
these shows, will go to God – is not possible.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.200
Only way is to keep your wisdom intact:

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:18.240
your steadfast faith that you are the Spirit and
God is compassion and He will make you the Spirit.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.600
This is the only thing that is needed in a seeker.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.400
But without wisdom when you
try any one of these things

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.800
then you have to go [in] a very round circle to
come to the same point but completely bruised,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.840
wounded, and sometimes absolutely sick to death.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:57.840
The problem today is very complex.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.600
Your infrastructure is spoilt not only by these

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:17.080
pseudo people [but] also by so many
other things which we have taken to:

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:29.440
the society, the family life, the addictions, the
habits, and so many things have crawled into us

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:44.160
and have woven such a net that
to get out of it is not possible.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.960
There’s only one way to get out of it.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:01.520
Once, as a child, I had read a story
about some birds: A net was cast,

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.640
and so many birds, doves,
they were caught in the net.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.400
And they discovered that,
“We are misled, misguided."

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.280
They saw some grains and they were misguided.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.800
So how to get out of the net?

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.000
Was impossible for them.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.600
Is an impossibility.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.360
One person cannot get out.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.000
One person tries to get out, others get
more entangled and he gets even worse.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.520
So what to do?

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:49.840
They all said, “Why not we all
fly out with the net itself?

00:23:51.920 --> 00:24:02.880
And then with our beaks we’ll cut out this net,
and we’ll be freed, but first get out from here.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.880
Put our energy together, all
of us and let’s fly out."

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.360
And that’s what they did.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.840
They spread their wings, all of
them put together, and took off.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.880
And off they went and they were freed.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.520
Today’s Sahaja Yoga is that kind of a trick.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.160
One person cannot work it out – is impossible.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:45.280
If one person has to do it, it’s an impossibility.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.040
He has to go and live in a cave permanently.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.880
Any one person even endowed
with powers like Christ,

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.200
comes on this earth is crucified –
finished! Three years, He’s crucified.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.880
Nobody understood Him.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:23.360
So we have to have many more, to get out of
this net, which is created through the efforts

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:36.760
of these pseudo people, through our
stupidity, our wrong doings, misguidances –

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.760
all kinds of problems which are against evolution.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:52.880
One has to become a whole group
to lift up the society higher

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:02.000
so that you can really get rid
of the shackles of this bondage.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:15.040
Could be there are some gurus in India who
are good gurus who are Realised souls, who

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:24.000
have taken many lives to be Realised and they are
very clean people, all that is there, no doubt.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:37.840
But they are very few and they all live in the
forest hiding in the caves, and even I told them,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.720
“Why don’t you come down from your hidings?”
They said, “It’s better we are safe here."

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.520
Their legs are broken, hands are broken.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.400
You see people have never tolerated them.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.440
So, according to them, after twelve years, I
think during all My stay in England perhaps,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.760
they’ll be better off to come down
– people won’t hurt them so much.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:10.800
One fellow was beaten up so much
that all his backbone was finished.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.560
So real gurus are just hiding.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:27.000
And the ones who out are just moneymaking
propositions – simple thing as that –

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:41.440
because they know how to pamper your ego, to
play upon your weaknesses, to make you more

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:49.960
embedded into that net, into that mire, and take
full advantage of you, that’s why they are here.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.080
People don’t like it [if I say that].

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.360
People get identified with that kind
of a chain, but that’s not freedom.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.800
Freedom is when you really get your
own powers which are within you.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.080
You have got your own powers.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.160
You have to be your own guru.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.680
You must reach that point
from where you guide yourself,

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:29.840
in such a way that the guiding
lines become part and parcel of you.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.600
That means in your central nervous system,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.840
in your conscious mind you must
feel the existence of the Spirit.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.880
This is what is the evolutionary process.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:57.840
This is what you have to achieve and all
other talks are absolutely of no value.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:06.080
Let us face it! There’s no flowery talk
needed for it, nothing of the kind.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.800
It’s a doing.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.040
Supposing I tell you, alright, if you have to

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:17.920
make such and such cake, you mix this,
mix that, mix that, mix that, is alright.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.240
But when you mix that you find
a poison is created out of that.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.320
Another person can say, “Alright I’ll mix this,

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.880
mix that and you have the cake,” and there’s
no cake nothing, then what do you eat?

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:43.840
So all these talks and all these organisations
and everything has no meaning of any kind.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.160
It doesn’t empower you to be the Spirit.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.560
I am not here to denounce anybody
or to make anybody low or anything

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.480
but what I think that they are wasting their
energy and your energy and their energy.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.960
Why don’t they accept that for years together
they have been doing all this nonsense

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.320
and they have achieved nothing.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.840
My main concern is that why don’t they see it?

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.720
Why are they so mass-minded?

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.280
Why don’t they see it clearly that these people

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.480
haven’t achieved anything and
what are we going to achieve?

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.720
“What my father did my grandfather did, my
great-grandfather did, I am doing the same thing

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.240
and I have not achieved anything
as they have not achieved anything.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:46.800
Why not?” Every scientific-minded
person should think like that.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.720
Every religious person should think that

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.000
this religion, if it has any meaning, it’s not
giving any fruits [from] what is written in there.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.520
In the Islam, if you read, I don’t
know if you people have read Koran,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.840
but is written that there
will be a day of Resurrection.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.080
That Resurrection has to take place,
has been said by every one of them.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.240
But what about that?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.600
Nobody wants to talk.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.320
They’ll only talk about the day of the doom

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.240
because then they can have a nice
money you see frightening you.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.160
“The day of the Doom is coming better give money."

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.440
As if God understands your bank accounts.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.280
You haven’t paid any money so far.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.480
Every such artificial type of thing

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:51.360
is accepted by reasonably wise,
sensible, educated, mature people

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.000
and they find it impossible to get out of it.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.880
This is a clubbing, it’s a mass thing.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.480
Know you are an individual just
now, to think for yourself.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.240
God has made you an individual.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.920
You are like an egg which is
an individual, we can say.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.120
You have to think about it.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.680
You have to judge about it to find out.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:34.480
And then you become the collective and that means
you become aware of your collectivity – aware.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.440
Collectivity doesn’t mean mass reaction.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.640
Like ten people start dancing, “Oh
that’s a very good cult you know."

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.280
What do they do?

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.080
They just stand up and dance.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.120
I mean for that, how much do you have to pay?

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.400
Only ten pounds, that’s all?

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.280
You just go there, take out your
clothes and dance, finished.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.080
You get to God.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.320
Very simple method, and people believe in it.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.760
I tell you people believe in it.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.360
They believe in all these tall stories.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.080
The simple thing they have to
see, “Have we become our Spirit?”

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.240
A simple question we should ask
ourself, “Is it for our Spirit?

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:28.320
Is there any rapport established with that Divine
Power?” Have you felt that Divine Power anywhere?

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:42.800
And when we are not keeping our minds
steady on this point, we can be ruined.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.480
This all this structure gets spoiled,
which is a very delicately made,

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:57.200
beautifully made, God has made it the best of
all, better than all the trees put together,

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:07.040
all the animals put together, everything,
is the epitome of His creation is man.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:15.680
Except for one thing: that he
has been given freedom to choose.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.800
It had to go.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.840
That had to be done.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.920
If you don’t give freedom at this stage,
how can you enter into complete freedom?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.880
If you do not know how to use
your freedom…supposing a man

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.720
who doesn’t know how to use his
freedom he goes about [with] daggers,

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:44.560
killing this killing that killing that person
or starts killing himself, it can be both ways.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.840
There are some who start killing
others or start killing themselves.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.880
Will you give him a freedom?

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.520
Even in a normal way we don’t give him freedom
to go about killing others, or killing himself.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:07.040
So he has to have idea of using his
freedom towards himself and towards others,

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.680
and that freedom we have to use.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.400
And if we have used it properly, wisely,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.440
then there’s no problem because
it’s made so beautifully.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.000
I told you how Kundalini is placed.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:38.680
How She is placed, at the safest
point and how She’s coiled up

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.560
and how these centres are kept so subtly within
your medulla oblongata in your spinal chord.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:55.840
How it is protected and how this Agnya Chakra
is placed between pituitary and pineal on the

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:04.800
optic chiasma point and how the Sahasrara
is made so beautifully – is amazing.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.040
Only thing [is] the light of Spirit
has to come to enlighten all that,

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.840
that’s all, nothing more needed.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:26.160
You have to just choose that, sensibly,
that you have to become the Spirit.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.840
You cannot force on the
organisation of God anything.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.320
He is on His own.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.000
His organisation on His own.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:46.560
Only thing you can do is to enter into His Kingdom
and become a part and parcel of that blissful

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.520
domain.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.200
You would never like to change
it either, it is so wonderful.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.600
It is so protective, is so loving, is
so gentle, so kind, so compassionate,

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.160
that you would hate to change that organisation.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.080
But we do! We try to organise God even.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:21.840
For people who think that that
is the ultimate you have to seek,

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.800
it’s all arranged to enter
into the Kingdom of God.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.760
The time has come.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.960
This is the Day of Resurrection.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.800
These are the Days of Resurrection.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.040
What Christ did,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.040
there are many people…I read the other day one
book saying that He never resurrected Himself.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.080
These human beings, I must say!
They scientifically they ‘proved’.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.440
‘Scientifically’, can you imagine?

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.800
Now how can you prove scientifically?

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.600
I don’t understand.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.080
According to them He didn’t die.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.840
Of course, He cannot die, He’s an Eternal
Being I know that part is correct.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.360
But He never died.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.000
He died the way a Divine has to die

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.560
but He resurrected Himself as
the Divine has to resurrect.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.040
He definitely resurrected Himself.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.520
But these scientists were not there to see.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.120
Then He descended again, that’s
a different point altogether.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.280
But He definitely resurrected His Divine Body.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.840
And He had such a beautiful,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:45.840
confident personality after that, that wherever
He went, He left a great imprint on people.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.600
And this is the trouble, that they try
to prove everything scientifically.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.760
You cannot prove Christ’s
resurrection scientifically.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.440
That’s why you cannot deny it either.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:14.320
What He did it on the gross level, at that time,
has to happen, in a subtle level within you.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.000
That, he has done, that’s why they
say, “You have to pass through Him."

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.960
He has done that for you.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:28.640
He has really done it, and we have
to see that happening within us.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.320
Not by saying that, “Now we follow Christ."

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.960
Alright, you have one big
flag: “Followers of Christ,”

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.880
“We are all Christian soldiers walking and we
believe in Christ and we are all resurrected."

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.400
No you are not.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.000
You are not.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.520
At the most if you are a good Christian
or a good Hindu or a good Muslim, good,

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.080
again I say, then you are well
balanced for your resurrection.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:15.200
But if you are not even that,
then it’s a problem for me,

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.440
problem for you.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:30.240
But if you have been a good Jew, or a good
Christian, or a good Hindu in the sense that

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.720
you have kept your sustenance alright you have
been a normal person, you have gone through the

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:41.360
central path and you have kept to the central path
of life, you are not an extremist, not a person

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:47.920
who does anything abnormal, is a normal
person, then you are very good for Realisation.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.840
It’s as simple as that.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:59.840
But the way people have carried
this simple method of organising

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:09.840
people into ‘better’ life, into something
so absurd like hating each other,

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.040
killing each other or all
sorts of things, you know.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.600
I mean it has nothing to do with God, believe Me.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.000
And “We are the chosen ones and we
are the best and we are the selected."

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.200
This is self-certificate.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.160
You see if I say, “I am the graduate
of the Cambridge University,”

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.240
how long can I befool Myself and others?

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.840
Which I am not.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.960
In the same way we have to really, really

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:57.920
get our certificate from ourselves that
we are reborn, not from anybody else.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:05.360
So we boil down to this point: that we have to
be really, really very honest with ourselves,

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:16.160
because it is our loss, nobody else’s, that so
far we have not achieved that state of Spirit

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.200
and that, in all humility
we are going to achieve it,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.880
we have to achieve it and we have to
accept that this should happen to us.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:35.200
This is so simple, it’s so simple, and so natural.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.800
It’s just in the event, that
at this time it had to happen.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:49.280
It’s a very simple thing, there’s no complication,
if you have not complicated yourself much.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.600
But even if you have,

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:00.160
the Divine Power knows how to
disentangle you and work it out.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:14.320
This is the blessing of the Divine
where you become the Spirit and then you

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.080
reach your absolute from where
there is no doubt about anything.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.640
If you want to know what happens
is that you just start feeling

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:32.160
a cool breeze flowing into your hands,
or from your hands, and then [if] you ask

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.160
a question, “Is there God?”
and the breeze is much more.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:45.440
If you ask about a thug, “Is
he a good man?” it stops.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:54.640
The rapport is established with your Spirit,
which speaks to you as cool breeze in the hand.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:04.560
This cool breeze in the hand is the energy of your
Spirit flowing by which your diseases get cured,

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:13.600
you can cure the diseases of others, you can raise
the Kundalini of others and give them Realisation

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.840
and you can enjoy the beauty of nature,

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:32.400
not thinking about it, or grossly valuing
it but just enjoying it in a full way.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.160
This is the short and sweet [version].

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:45.520
But it’s such a long story,
started thousands of years back,

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.520
and today, it is just reaching its climax.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.560
The fruit is just going to be formed.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:08.160
It’s just the blossom time has come for
this story and if the seekers co-operate,

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.440
I am sure it will work out.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.120
I have all the hopes.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.840
May God bless you all.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:31.840
Have you any questions for me

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:45.840
today?

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:59.840
No questions?

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:10.160
Why don’t you come, there are lots of seats here,
all of you can come and sit down, come along.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.840
Need not stand all the way.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.880
Children should sit in the first row.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.560
That’s your child?

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.640
It’s good.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:41.840
It’s born-realised.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.800
So many great children are born in this country.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.880
I don’t know how many understand it.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.120
He, or it is she?

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:55.840
Hello.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.000
She wished Me outside.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.840
Now there’s was a gentlemen poor thing
he has to look after the child, is it?

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.600
Let him bring the child.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.960
Children don’t trouble.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.920
Just bring them in.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.920
We like them to be in, they just keep quietly.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:24.840
They enjoy it.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.520
Yes.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.160
Why keep the child?

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.080
These are all born-realised children to you.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.800
They won’t trouble you, sit
down, they’ll be very happy here.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.520
Leave them alone.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:48.240
Hello, yes, come along, let them play.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.080
Just let them play.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.400
You see they know what to do they are busy people.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.480
They know what to do, they’re busy people.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.840
They’re relaxed.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:08.880
Alright.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.680
No question really?

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.520
Sure?

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.320
No questions?

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:20.720
Alright.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.960
So now only one question
could be, that how to do it?

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.200
Who’ll bell the cat?

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.840
It’s very simple.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.120
How do you sprout a seed?

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.280
In the same way, it is done.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:55.840
As you have seen there, that the hands denote
all the centres: five, six and seven centres.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.840
There’s a handbook also which you
can take it and see for yourself.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.920
Now some of the people I’ve seen when
they take the book you see, they read it

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.520
and they get worried about something.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.000
Whatever is written in that book is the truth.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.680
Now we have tried to keep away lots of it,

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.360
from people because they want to have
the truth, what to see themselves.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.960
Like some people only hear
what they want to hear you see.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.720
The rest they don’t hear.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.680
But whatever was necessary to be
told, has been told in that book,

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.320
which should not frighten you in
any way or should not bother you.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:49.440
You just see the book and read it if you want,
and see for yourself whether it is true or not.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.600
But just do not get worried about that.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:59.520
Is a wrong attitude, because I’m talking about
the realm which you have never known before.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.800
This is the area which is unknown to you,

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.640
so if you are entering into that area which
is unknown to you, you need not just get upset

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.320
about it, but see for yourself whatever
is written in that book is true or not.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.040
Though we have kept out lots
of things from there, not to

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.320
upset you because people get upset with anything.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.960
Even if they see a candle they get
upset, “Why there’s a candle?”.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.720
I said, “Now, what to do?” If electric
light is there is alright, but no candle.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.720
If they see this they’ll say, “Why this?”

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.080
See everything can make you upset.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.360
You have ideas you see, that a person
who is going to give you Realisation

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:53.840
should be sitting in some black place, you
see, all covered with two horns coming out.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.400
That’s not the thing.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.360
I have to be the most normal person,
isn’t it, otherwise you won’t accept.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:12.240
So all these ideas you have about people,
or some people think that a person who’s

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.800
such and such should be of this height,
of this width, this face, of this, that.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.880
All this is your own imagination.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:28.640
So we have to keep ourselves open because this
realm you have to get into and see for yourself.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:35.840
Just keep yourself open and see for yourself.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.640
Now you have got these five centres,
six and seven centres in your hand.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.120
Now I’m telling you this, but it doesn’t
mean that I’m forcing on you something

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.400
or a brainwashing is there, but
these centres are there, you see.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.800
If you go to a doctor he’ll tell you about things

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.560
and the same way I’m telling you
that there are seven centres.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.880
These are the basic centres within us, basic.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.320
And these centres are shown here,
did you somebody talk here, Gavin?

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.840
So they are shown on here.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:15.760
Now when you put your hands towards Me like this,
these sympathetic centres get activated, just like

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:22.800
as you put the seed in a particular manner it
sprouts, it’s just like that, there’s nothing,

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.480
so you have to just put the hands.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.560
Now some people have an objection even for that.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.200
Now you have come all the
way for your Realisation.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.120
What is the harm for putting hands like this?

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.880
What is the harm?

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.560
But even they have objection for that.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.200
But if a guru is there they’ll bow
to him one thousand and one times,

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:47.120
give him five hundred pounds and again bow
to him and go back into lunatic asylum.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.520
I mean I have met many like that.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:58.160
But if you tell them just put your hands like
this, because after all the energy has to flow.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.920
Apart from that, you have to ask for it.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.640
It cannot be forced, because
you are a free person,

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.640
you are free person not to
have it or to have it, alright?

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.240
But if you have to have it, I
mean if you don’t want to have it,

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.920
well and good, then we don’t
have anything to do with you.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.480
We don’t want to waste our energy
with people who don’t want to have it.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.200
Just we do not want to waste our
energy, because why should we?

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.840
If you don’t want to have it,
it cannot be forced, you see.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.560
It’s not a horse that you can put
in the mouth and the horse eats,

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.800
it’s not like that, because the
taste of this you have never known.

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:40.720
You see is a new area into which you
have to that is your spiritual area,

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.600
for that you have to understand how to get to it.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.960
And for that even a small
thing like putting the hands,

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.160
if people don’t want to do it
means they are not seekers at all.

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.320
There’s nothing to be frightened.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.800
Kundalini doesn’t trouble anyone.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.800
We have had thousands of people realised,
nobody had any problem, nothing.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.840
On the contrary, you feel much better and cured.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.440
Just close your eyes, put
both the feet on the ground.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.520
That also has a meaning because when I
say put both the feet, it has a meaning.

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.240
I won’t tell you anything that is not necessary,
because I have to gain nothing out of it.

00:54:26.667 --> 00:54:29.840
Is better to take out if possible
but if they are there doesn’t matter.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:34.160
But you see they just little bit
you know too many reasons they are.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:39.200
Then sometimes they do, and even
the tight things in the waist.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.760
If the waist is very tight,

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:48.960
physically, then this is not proper,
you can just loosen it a little bit.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.720
But with some people the Kundalini shoots
off so fast that whatever may be the type

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:59.120
of way you are sitting or the way you are,
whatever you are doing just shoots off.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:19.840
Now, put your hands towards Me
like this, and close your eyes.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.720
Keep your eyes shut, that is very important
to keep your eyes shut, because the Kundalini

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:47.840
when She rises, over the Agnya She dilates your
pupils and if it is not closed She won’t rise.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.880
Just keep your eyes shut, it will work out.

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.600
Keep your eyes shut please,
just keep your eyes shut.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:04.720
This is the chance of lives,
not of one life, know that.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:12.000
This is what you have been seeking in all your
lives and you have to have it, you have to get it.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.840
You must get your own power.

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:26.320
Close your eyes.
