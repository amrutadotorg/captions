00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:42.941
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:57.511
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
truth is what it is.

00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:04.351
You cannot change it; you cannot transform
it; you cannot conceptualize it.

00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:14.891
It is what it is; it was what it was and it
will be what it will be.

00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:30.471
Whatever, I want to tell you today, I have
to request you, to keep your mind open, like

00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:31.591
scientist.

00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.561
You need not believe into what I say.

00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:39.001
We have had enough of problems with blind
faith.

00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:50.821
But keep your minds open in case this proves;
then you have to believe, believe in it.

00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:54.161
If you are honest people, you have to believe
in it.

00:09:54.161 --> 00:10:04.021
Because it is for the benevolence of your
individual self, for the benevolence of your

00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:10.180
city, your country and world at large.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:17.411
Most of the problems of this world come from
human beings; humbly we must admit.

00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:24.391
There something wrong somewhere that we create
problems.

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:31.451
And these problems come to human beings when
there is a problem with these centres here

00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:35.531
as explained to you.

00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:37.481
Now these centres do exist.

00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:40.231
These are energy centres within you.

00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:46.491
And when they are, (Mother speaks aside, Thank
you, (Lawrence?)

00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:59.171
thank you, its cold, I don’t like, I like,
just ordinary (glass of water)) these centres,

00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:11.261
when they go into jeopardy, we have this problem
of human beings behaving in funny manners.

00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:25.771
When this power, which is within us, which
is in three and a half coils; that’s why

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:28.581
it is called as kundalini; “kundalini”
means a coil.

00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:30.961
It’s a mathematical thing.

00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:44.481
It rises like a primule in a seed and rises
upward against the gravity, and pierces through

00:11:44.481 --> 00:11:55.371
your fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

00:11:55.371 --> 00:12:04.890
(Mother speaks aside, Thank you very much,
(referring to glass of water) thank you)

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:16.110
Now the truth is that you are not this body,
you are not this mind, you are not this ego,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.461
you are not these conditionings.

00:12:20.461 --> 00:12:27.451
What we say, “This is my house, this is
my car, this is my wife, this is my husband,

00:12:27.451 --> 00:12:35.821
my children” but who is this ‘my’ which
owns it?

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:46.341
So that ‘my’ which owns it is the ‘I’
the “self”; is the ‘pure spirit’ within

00:12:46.341 --> 00:12:47.791
you.

00:12:47.791 --> 00:13:01.151
The second truth is, that there is all-pervading
power of Divine Love, of love, which does

00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:03.641
all the living work.

00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:07.981
Now you see beautiful flowers all over since
I’ve come to Australia.

00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:12.871
I’ve been seeing all kinds of flowers, beautiful
flowers.

00:13:12.871 --> 00:13:15.171
Who does this miracle?

00:13:15.171 --> 00:13:18.511
They’re different, of a different shape,
different colour.

00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:19.511
“Who” does that?

00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:25.701
Who runs our heart, we never ask this question
to ourselves.

00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:28.321
We take all living work for granted.

00:13:28.321 --> 00:13:38.141
We never bother to find out who does that.

00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:44.101
The third question that should come to us
really, which cannot be answered by anyone:

00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.390
“Why are we on this Earth?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:53.341
What is our purpose of coming to this Earth,
to be born as human beings, to be evolved

00:13:53.341 --> 00:13:56.071
as human beings, what is the purpose?”

00:13:56.071 --> 00:14:01.201
Is it just to insure our self and die?

00:14:01.201 --> 00:14:03.361
Is that?

00:14:03.361 --> 00:14:05.351
What is the purpose of life?

00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:07.081
What is our identity?

00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:16.011
And when we start asking these questions,
we find that nobody has been able to answer

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:27.471
this question.

00:14:27.471 --> 00:14:31.231
Science cannot answer this question.

00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:35.511
Science has its own limitations.

00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:42.461
So this all-pervading power, which does all
the living work, we have never felt it.

00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:47.521
We have read it in Scriptures that there is
all-pervading power of God’s love, there’s

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:49.231
the ‘Ruh’, is there.

00:14:49.231 --> 00:14:55.241
They call it Paramchaitanya or also they say
it is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:57.801
But where is that?

00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:00.991
Nobody has felt it, nobody has known about
it.

00:15:00.991 --> 00:15:10.531
Another problem is this that our civilizations
grew too big in the West, even in Australia,

00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:11.531
everywhere.

00:15:11.531 --> 00:15:18.561
Like a big tree but what about the roots?

00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:23.651
If you do not find the roots, the result is
as you have now recession; this problem, that

00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:26.381
problem.

00:15:26.381 --> 00:15:29.521
So where are the roots?

00:15:29.521 --> 00:15:36.351
If the knowledge of Science comes from West,
this knowledge comes to you, say from India,

00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:40.700
or from East, what’s the harm.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:46.111
Because it is important that we should know
our roots.

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:51.661
And these are the roots, this is the knowledge
of the roots that is within us.

00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:57.541
When there is problem outwardly, we should
know there must be some problem inside us

00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:02.771
and we don’t know anything about ourselves;
nothing.

00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:05.181
What we know; about outside.

00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:16.071
But we don’t know what’s wrong with us;
where do we go wrong?

00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:24.841
So it is very important to understand that
if there is a way of going through the last

00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:30.481
breakthrough of our evolution, if there’s
a way that we can find out our identity, if

00:16:30.481 --> 00:16:36.471
there’s a way we can know our inner self
fully, why not do it?

00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:39.171
For which you don’t have to pay.

00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:42.781
You can’t pay; it’s an evolutionary process.

00:16:42.781 --> 00:16:44.631
It’s a living process!

00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:51.071
For example, how much do we pay for these
flowers to Mother Earth?

00:16:51.071 --> 00:16:53.601
Who’s done the job?

00:16:53.601 --> 00:17:07.860
It’s built-in in a seed, to germinate and
built-in in the Mother Land that it will germinate.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.981
We don’t pay for that.

00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:10.221
It’s already built-in there.

00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:14.671
In the same way if it is built-in within you,
you can’t pay for it.

00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:20.831
One thing, if you realize that you can’t
pay for your evolutionary process, for anything

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:29.971
that is Divinity, for anything that is pure;
half of the problems will be solved of this

00:17:29.971 --> 00:17:34.841
guru shopping that you have been doing all
these days.

00:17:34.841 --> 00:17:42.521
Because if you are not going to pay for it,
and these people are asking for money, that

00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:44.151
means something wrong with them!

00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:46.161
You cannot market it!

00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:58.211
Thus, we reach a point where we realize that
something spontaneous living process has to

00:17:58.211 --> 00:17:59.561
take place.

00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:08.961
And that has become very, very easy in modern
times.

00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:14.711
Because it is described already, prophesized
in the Bible, it is the Last Judgment and

00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:18.991
otherwise in the Koran it is “Qiyamah”,
means the Resurrection.

00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:24.421
Even in Indian scriptures they have described
about these special times when people who

00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:32.351
will get so much disillusioned in the illusion,
they will be born and they will be disillusioned

00:18:32.351 --> 00:18:35.641
that they take to reality, and this thing
will happen.

00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:44.250
It’s already predicted and this is the time,
such a fortunate time when we are all born.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.201
And it has to work out.

00:18:47.201 --> 00:18:48.891
It is your own power.

00:18:48.891 --> 00:18:57.861
It’s your own Mother, it’s your individual
Mother, and She knows everything about you.

00:18:57.861 --> 00:18:59.721
It’s all tape-recorded.

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:02.831
And She is anxious to give you this Second
Birth.

00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:05.051
She is anxious.

00:19:05.051 --> 00:19:06.831
And She does it very beautifully.

00:19:06.831 --> 00:19:13.401
I’ve read some books which says that Kundalini
Awakening is very dangerous and all that.

00:19:13.401 --> 00:19:14.401
I can’t understand!

00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:16.750
It has never happened before like that.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:23.310
I’ve been working like this for the last,
I think, I don’t know how many years now;

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:29.791
at least twenty-five years and I’ve never
seen anybody being harmed.

00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:33.621
On the contrary, everybody’s helped; physically,
mentally, emotionally.

00:19:33.621 --> 00:19:47.371
Now there are three doctors who have got M.D.
in Delhi University for Sahaja Yoga, in various

00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:48.371
subjects.

00:19:48.371 --> 00:19:53.500
Now there’s a fourth doctor who is trying
on blood cancer and all that.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.141
For medical science, if you ask them who does
all these things they will say “autonomous

00:19:58.141 --> 00:19:59.561
nervous system”.

00:19:59.561 --> 00:20:04.911
But who is this “auto”, who is this “auto”
that does this work?

00:20:04.911 --> 00:20:09.001
They can’t answer; they’re honest; they
can’t answer.

00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:17.771
So this autonomous nervous system, which is
parasympathetic and sympathetic, the parasympathetic

00:20:17.771 --> 00:20:24.441
nervous system will take over and we can control
our parasympathetic through this.

00:20:24.441 --> 00:20:32.881
Of course, I don’t know how far the doctors
here are sensitive to a subject like that

00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:35.231
but in Russia I was surprised.

00:20:35.231 --> 00:20:40.521
There are two hundred doctors who are practicing
Sahaja Yoga in Russia.

00:20:40.521 --> 00:20:46.141
Russian people are not so materialistic because
they have never known materialism much.

00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:48.841
About 30% of them are funny type.

00:20:48.841 --> 00:20:55.241
They’ll ask for Marlboro cigarettes but
70% are so sensitive to Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:55.241 --> 00:21:01.401
I was amazed the way they took to me and threw
away all absurd gurus from them.

00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:03.331
Not one person could prosper.

00:21:03.331 --> 00:21:10.351
And no religion is allowed to be practiced
there where they have now started taking to

00:21:10.351 --> 00:21:11.351
Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:18.571
It’s very amazing how these people who don’t
know even English, who don’t know about

00:21:18.571 --> 00:21:24.681
God; they were not supposed to know about
any religion, they’re so clean, like a clean

00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:30.241
slate and they have taken to Sahaja in such
a big manner; I’m surprised.

00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:37.671
In thousands and thousands of people, so sensitive,
so open-minded and scientifically so equipped.

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:44.371
There were 300 scientists, I think maybe more,
who invited me.

00:21:44.371 --> 00:21:49.211
Started telling them about I…I thought,
better start from science.

00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:52.231
So they said, “Mother, no, don’t tell
us science; we know everything about science.

00:21:52.231 --> 00:21:54.971
No we don’t, You tell us the science of
God.”

00:21:54.971 --> 00:22:04.381
Such eager, intelligent, educated people.

00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:11.091
Now, this democracy of ours ‘so-called’,
today also in the newspaper.

00:22:11.091 --> 00:22:15.381
I read the same thing: “so-called democracy”.

00:22:15.381 --> 00:22:20.831
Because it looks sometimes like a demonocracy
you see, like you go to America; you can’t

00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:24.001
even wear your wedding ring.

00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:27.871
They might take away your wedding ring also
and kill you for that.

00:22:27.871 --> 00:22:32.011
That’s supposed to be democracy!

00:22:32.011 --> 00:22:34.491
You have to be extremely careful.

00:22:34.491 --> 00:22:35.971
I was surprised in Perth.

00:22:35.971 --> 00:22:40.631
We were going in the night for about thirty-five
kilometres.

00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:43.271
No gangsterism on the way, I was surprised.

00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:46.551
How this country is still saved.

00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:52.981
But it happens that this kind of democracy
without being in connection with that all-pervading

00:22:52.981 --> 00:22:56.531
power can take you to anything.

00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:58.690
Same with religions.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.791
You take any religion, whether you are Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, anything.

00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:05.781
One can commit any sin.

00:23:05.781 --> 00:23:11.671
What’s the use of denouncing others; everybody
does the same I thing; no difference.

00:23:11.671 --> 00:23:23.561
All are only convinced they are something
excellent but they are not, in no way!

00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:30.351
And so many things like this, when we start
seeing, we get disillusioned and we start

00:23:30.351 --> 00:23:36.851
thinking, “Where is the truth, where is
the reality, what are we doing?”

00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:42.870
At this time, I see; I call them ‘the seekers
of truth’.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:54.351
These are special category of people, as described
by so many poets.

00:23:54.351 --> 00:24:06.171
And when it works out, they are the ones who
jump into themselves.

00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:11.830
Jump into this beautiful era, of what we call
the New Age.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.101
It’s a happening.

00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.901
It’s not just branding yourself New Age;
somebody calls themselves by some other name,

00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:19.521
it’s not that.

00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:22.750
It’s another Christian, Hindu, Muslim branding.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:29.451
But something that has to happen and that
happening is awakening of the kundalini.

00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:37.171
William Blake has said that men of God will
be born in those days, men of God.

00:24:37.171 --> 00:24:41.271
And they will become divine and they will
have powers to make others divine, exactly

00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:48.771
that is Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:48.771 --> 00:25:00.041
Moreover it’s such an internal happening
that, all outside things are not needed.

00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:05.590
For example, some people go to Himalayas,
stand on their heads.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.481
Or they starve themselves, fast, do all kinds
of things.

00:25:10.481 --> 00:25:11.481
And they find nothing.

00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:13.960
They can’t understand how it happens.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:21.121
They go on telling me; Mother we did this,
we did that and we never found anything within

00:25:21.121 --> 00:25:23.001
ourselves.

00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:31.351
So first you are to be connected to that all
pervading power, this is the power that’s

00:25:31.351 --> 00:25:38.141
extremely dynamic no doubt, but it’s the
power of compassion.

00:25:38.141 --> 00:25:40.001
So you also become very dynamic.

00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:42.201
I know poor people becoming very rich suddenly.

00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:47.070
I have seen people who are sick becoming all
right.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:55.101
We have a very nice place in Perth, where
a boy who was already married, had children,

00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:56.280
two children.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:03.101
He was in an accident and whole his brain
as if came out; a terrible condition.

00:26:03.101 --> 00:26:06.580
And doctors gave it up that he will die.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.940
Not that he was saved, but he is absolutely
normal now.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:18.450
I was in tears to see him so beautifully cured.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:30.830
So this all-pervading power, which is the
Ocean of Bliss, Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:39.050
of Compassion, is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.710
This power starts flowing through you.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.801
You become a vehicle of that power.

00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:56.491
And once you learn how to make others the
same way, how to raise their kundalini, you

00:26:56.491 --> 00:27:00.090
can create thousands of people who are self-realized.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:08.400
Surprisingly, in Australia many children are
born who are realized souls, very surprising.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:16.041
Maybe because in other European countries
children are killed by the parents.

00:27:16.041 --> 00:27:20.420
So maybe they are taking to you people who
are kind to children and your government is

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.991
also very kind to them.

00:27:22.991 --> 00:27:32.991
And these children are not understood by parents
sometimes because they’re very different.

00:27:32.991 --> 00:27:35.940
And they are very moral.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:43.801
So all the problems that we have created out
of our ideas of sort of modernism or any kind

00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:45.320
of thing.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:53.521
And that we see that our children are going
to dogs is all stopped through this awakening.

00:27:53.521 --> 00:28:02.460
It’s like this, that if I tell some children
don’t take to drugs, they’ll never listen

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.261
to me.

00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:10.491
If, supposing I’m carrying a snake in my
hand and there’s darkness all over, I can’t

00:28:10.491 --> 00:28:14.030
see anything and somebody says, “you have
a snake in your hand”, I’ll never give

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.881
up if I’m very obstinate, I will never give
up.

00:28:16.881 --> 00:28:18.921
I’ll say, “No, it’s just a rope.”

00:28:18.921 --> 00:28:25.540
But when there’s little light I will myself
give it up.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:31.281
In the same way it happens; it works this
way that you yourself become powerful.

00:28:31.281 --> 00:28:40.180
Throw away all that is destructive, all that
is to be given up.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.551
I don’t have to say “Don’t do this;
the Ten Commandments we don’t talk about

00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:49.540
in Sahaja Yoga, but only in you, the religion
is born.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:55.520
The innate religion, which keeps you religious,
righteous, compassionate and dynamic.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.852
You don’t have to change your dress, you
don’t have to change your lifestyle, you

00:29:00.852 --> 00:29:06.001
don’t have to give up your wives and children,
but you get it just where you are.

00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:10.030
It’s so simple, made so simple.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:15.180
I would say, if you are hungry, you can have
it.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:21.210
Like, if I’ve done the cooking, and if you
are hungry and you will say otherwise “mother

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.390
just lets have the food.”

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.601
But if you are not, then you will go on discussing,
arguing, this, that.

00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:30.710
These are all mental feats.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:35.680
I mean if you want to ask me a question, you
can ask me any number and I am quite an expert

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:43.021
now 25 years I have been facing all of you
and I can answer you, but its all a mental

00:29:43.021 --> 00:29:44.021
feat.

00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:45.401
It doesn’t give you realization.

00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:50.840
You are here for your realization, by which
you are helped so much that physically, mentally,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.970
emotionally, and spiritually you become all
right.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:03.390
Firstly, you become peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.751
The peace within you, you achieve.

00:30:05.751 --> 00:30:07.161
How?

00:30:07.161 --> 00:30:09.460
You live with your thoughts.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:16.940
The thoughts rise, fall, rise, fall and in
between these thoughts, there’s a little

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.950
space.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.020
Mostly, you are thinking about the future
or the past.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.430
You cannot be in the present.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.470
In the present, there is no thought.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.001
You are with reality.

00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:35.671
So when the kundalini rises, these thoughts
elongate and the space in between, of the

00:30:35.671 --> 00:30:38.871
present is established.

00:30:38.871 --> 00:30:47.190
When that space is established, you become
peaceful, absolutely peaceful within yourself.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:59.381
I have met many people, elite people, I should
say, very elite, who have got Peace Prizes.

00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:05.920
They’re so hot-tempered people, I tell you,
that you have to touch them with a barge pole.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.840
I mean you cannot go near them.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.601
It is horribly hot-tempered people, and they
have got peace awards I don’t know how.

00:31:12.601 --> 00:31:13.601
No peace within.

00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:16.761
At the slightest thing, they just shoot off.

00:31:16.761 --> 00:31:18.801
No patience, nothing.

00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:27.590
And then I realize that it’s so outside;
the whole thing is.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:33.210
They don’t understand if you don’t have
peace within, how can have a Peace Award?

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.210
Well you can.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:38.080
That is our life.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:44.421
Now this peace is established within you and
you become, it’s a new dimension of existence,

00:31:44.421 --> 00:31:45.931
where you become “thoughtlessly aware”.

00:31:45.931 --> 00:31:49.391
You are absolutely aware, but no thoughts.

00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:51.041
Just in peace.

00:31:51.041 --> 00:32:02.101
But you are aware; you are not fainted down
or you are not in some sort of a trance.

00:32:02.101 --> 00:32:11.611
You are absolutely aware and very much more
aware because, you are in Reality.

00:32:11.611 --> 00:32:16.420
Then the second dimension you achieve is that
you start feeling on your fingertips this

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.881
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:32:19.881 --> 00:32:21.930
Sometimes you feel it hot, also.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:29.420
On these fingertips are your sympathetic centres.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:34.720
And these Sympathetic Centres are from left
and right.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.940
They join together to make the Parasympathetic.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:46.401
So we have the left side and the right side
within us, and these left and right side,

00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:49.101
indicates on our right and left side.

00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:56.010
On the left side we get our emotional and
the right side our mental.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:00.881
I mean English Language, “mental” means
something different, but I mean whatever we

00:33:00.881 --> 00:33:02.910
do with our brain.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:09.790
And also you receive your physical problems
on the right hand side.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:13.690
These problems are indicative on your fingertips.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:22.900
Said it by Hazrat Mohammed that at the time
of Qiyamah your hands will speak and will

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.351
give witness against you; means they will
tell you what’s wrong with you.

00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:32.700
But not only that; they also tell you what’s
wrong with others.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:39.560
Now somehow if you know how to correct these
centres, you’re all right, and correct the

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.090
centres of others you can also make them all
right.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.391
It’s so simple, it’s all within you, all
the mechanism is within you.

00:33:48.391 --> 00:33:50.101
It’s all there.

00:33:50.101 --> 00:33:54.300
Only thing you have to understand the importance
of it.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.580
Without that you can never be happy.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.690
This power, which is there, is the power of
pure desire.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:05.371
All other desires are not pure.

00:34:05.371 --> 00:34:08.501
Today we want to have say; some flowers.

00:34:08.501 --> 00:34:11.891
Tomorrow we want to have a house; the day
after tomorrow we want to have helicopter.

00:34:11.891 --> 00:34:15.281
I don’t know; we go on and on.

00:34:15.281 --> 00:34:20.241
So every desire, which is fulfilled, is never
satisfied!

00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:21.481
Once we get it, it’s finished.

00:34:21.481 --> 00:34:27.440
Then again of course, it’s a law of economics
also, that in general, wants are not satiable.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.910
It’s a fact.

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:32.710
But this desire, whether you know it or not,
is within you.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:38.741
Whether you are aware of it or not, is the
desire to be one with this all-pervading power.

00:34:38.741 --> 00:34:44.481
And all the powers that you have within you
start manifesting.

00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:50.391
You have no idea at all what powers you have.

00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:55.920
I always say about a television taken to a
very remote village in India where they have

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.190
never seen electricity.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:02.981
And if you tell them that in this box you
can see some films, they’ll say, “What,

00:35:02.981 --> 00:35:04.901
this is just a box!

00:35:04.901 --> 00:35:06.470
What are you telling us stories?”

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:11.420
We also feel we are just a box, nothing more
than a box.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.550
But do you know what powers you have within
yourself?

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.751
What you can do for this world?

00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:22.710
What can you do for yourself, to your family,
to your children?

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:32.270
How you can really be a great force of reforms
and transformation without troubling anybody?

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:37.280
Because, after this you know the absolute
truth.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.030
You know them on your fingertips.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.920
If a man from India comes from the jail, he’ll
directly come either to Australia or he will

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:54.511
go to America, wear a dress of a what you
call this saddhu baba dress in saffron colour,

00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:58.330
and go and sit in any place and become a big
guru.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.090
Earn a lot of money.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:10.251
How will you know if this fellow has been
to jail, or is he a real person or not?

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:16.530
So on your fingertips you can find out the
absolute truth.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:26.781
A new dimension in you, that on your fingertips
you know not only your centres, but the centres

00:36:26.781 --> 00:36:27.840
of others.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.751
Everybody feels the same way, knows the same
way.

00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:36.671
Then where is the quarrel, where is the argument,
where is the war?

00:36:36.671 --> 00:36:43.651
Now we have in India sometimes, people coming
from sixty nations because Sahaja Yoga is

00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:45.181
now practised in sixty nations.

00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:49.531
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, fighting,
of course they pull each other’s leg and

00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:56.361
have a little humor about it, but never have
I seen fighting, never!

00:36:56.361 --> 00:36:59.241
No question, no question of argument.

00:36:59.241 --> 00:37:04.690
Because, you do not know the absolute truth,
so somebody says that Christianity is good,

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:10.720
somebody says this Islam is good, somebody
says that is good or democracy is good, or

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.881
communism is good.

00:37:11.881 --> 00:37:12.881
How?

00:37:12.881 --> 00:37:17.280
How do you know that?

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.170
Because you have got yarn in your heads, and
that’s how you’re formed your own ideas

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.881
and you’re all fighting with each other.

00:37:24.881 --> 00:37:27.690
It’s all mental, which is all limited.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:34.070
But, with this, you know the Absolute and
is tangible.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.710
You can diagnose people.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:45.780
One fellow went to Huston and he said “Mother,
I was half dead with diagnosis only.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.590
But I said, “You don’t have to do anything
in Sahaja Yoga like that.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.621
You can diagnose about yourself, you can diagnose
about others.

00:37:51.621 --> 00:37:55.790
There’s no need to go through all that.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:38:01.080
This is what it is that you have to have your
own powers manifesting.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.830
And you must have the full knowledge about
it.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.440
It should not be half way.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:16.411
Your attention becomes extremely innocent
and powerful.

00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:22.380
The attention, when it is diverted everywhere;
you see you get confused and people get schizophrenia,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.380
this, that; all that.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:32.450
But here the attention is very innocent and
such a person, even if he radiates or even

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:40.481
if he looks at or glances at somebody; he
can give peace; he can give redemption; he

00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:46.880
can do so many things, he can do, because
his attention has become enlightened.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.810
Sitting down here you can know about anybody
you want to know.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:56.320
You can know about the people who are dead,
or the people who are very far away.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:03.960
You can find out sitting down.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.291
This is what we can call as “collective
consciousness”.

00:39:07.291 --> 00:39:13.560
A new dimension of consciousness comes to
you about which Jung has written, collective

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.040
consciousness.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.180
So you develop this collective consciousness
within yourself.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.391
For that you don’t need any education, you
don’t need anything.

00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:23.391
Even villagers can do it.

00:39:23.391 --> 00:39:27.400
Even small little children can do it, because
they know this power.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:33.050
As all of us have the power to see something,
as you all can see me sitting down here, in

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:43.580
the same way you can know about others; know
about yourself; without doing any acrobats.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:49.410
So simple as that, all these powers are your.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:55.871
But above all, you jump in the Sea Of Joy.

00:39:55.871 --> 00:40:03.060
The whole problem is taken over by this all-pervading
power of God.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.391
We say we leave it to God, all right, leave
it to God.

00:40:05.391 --> 00:40:06.930
But you are not connected.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:10.481
When we pray also we are not connected.

00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:15.970
You know a telephone, which is not connected,
you go on moving it, it will get spoiled but

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.611
you are not connected.

00:40:17.611 --> 00:40:24.700
After realization, even to, just a problem
comes to you and it gets solved, because you

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.420
get out of your problem and you can see it
clearly and the Divine helps you.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:36.940
There have been so many blissful miracles
of Sahaja Yogis that now we have given up.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.372
We wanted to print them, but in one month
they became so much high and we didn’t know

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:42.560
what to do.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:50.941
So, all over we have to not believe in God,
but you have to feel the bliss of God; how

00:40:50.941 --> 00:40:53.330
He looks after you.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:59.530
It’s not just a talk or a sermon, but it’s
a happening and the happening has to take

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:04.501
place; otherwise our attention, which is outside,
will not be taken inside.

00:41:04.501 --> 00:41:10.750
It’s a question of understanding our own
value, respecting ourselves.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.000
And it works.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.810
As you all are here I know you are all seekers.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.111
Otherwise you would not be here.

00:41:18.111 --> 00:41:21.810
And it is your right to get this realization.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.601
Sahaja means “born”: ‘sah’ is with
you; ‘jah’ is “born”.

00:41:26.601 --> 00:41:28.520
“With you” is “born”.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.530
This right to get to this yoga, means the
union with the Divine.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:39.021
And is your right and you should assert and
all those who will ask for it have to have

00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:40.021
it.

00:41:40.021 --> 00:41:41.211
It is their right.

00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.631
The whole thing has built in our evolutionary
process.

00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:51.810
And now, the last bit has to happen and it
will work out.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.231
I have to tell you one thing more; that it
is not an individual happening.

00:41:56.231 --> 00:41:58.561
It’s a collective happening.

00:41:58.561 --> 00:42:02.071
It works better when there are many people.

00:42:02.071 --> 00:42:07.621
Also when you have to know about it, learn
about it, take advantage of it, you have to

00:42:07.621 --> 00:42:08.780
come to the collective.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:14.221
It’s not like other organizations where
they have an introductory lecture and after

00:42:14.221 --> 00:42:15.861
that they start marketing it.

00:42:15.861 --> 00:42:17.770
You cannot market it.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.101
For definite, you cannot market it.

00:42:21.101 --> 00:42:22.751
It is divine love.

00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:26.621
And love you can never market.

00:42:26.621 --> 00:42:31.391
In the same way this is Divine Love; how can
you market it?

00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:37.551
So, if you have respect for yourself, if you
really love yourself, and you care for yourself,

00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:45.191
you are not self-centered because after all,
you are a human being; epitome of evolution.

00:42:45.191 --> 00:42:52.691
So, only thing you have to give some time
and come to the collective and progress in

00:42:52.691 --> 00:42:53.691
Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:55.061
It’s not difficult at all.

00:42:55.061 --> 00:43:01.231
Nothing is to be done as I told you; it’s
not to stand on your head or anything.

00:43:01.231 --> 00:43:03.181
Just wherever you are, you’ll get it.

00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:05.441
It’s so simple.

00:43:05.441 --> 00:43:08.441
Because the time has come.

00:43:08.441 --> 00:43:11.301
And you are not obliged to me buying for anything.

00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:18.551
It’s just happening, happening all over
and happens to everyone.

00:43:18.551 --> 00:43:22.241
So I would request you to pay attention to
it.

00:43:22.241 --> 00:43:27.031
And once you get your realization, you should
really come to the collective because it would

00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:34.751
be like what Christ has described as sprouted,
seeds which were thrown somewhere and were

00:43:34.751 --> 00:43:39.211
lost, so you have to grow, and that growth
is important.

00:43:39.211 --> 00:43:44.801
Once it happens, if you have any concern for
your country, for yourself and for the world,

00:43:44.801 --> 00:43:48.381
you should try to keep to it and understand.

00:43:48.381 --> 00:43:50.841
It’s as simple as that.

00:43:50.841 --> 00:43:56.571
So the last thing as I told you, jump in the
ocean of joy.

00:43:56.571 --> 00:44:03.301
That is, when your ego is pampered you feel
happy and when the ego is punctured, you feel

00:44:03.301 --> 00:44:04.441
unhappy.

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:06.501
It is joy, has no duality.

00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:09.931
It’s just a witness state in which you witness
everything like a drama.

00:44:09.931 --> 00:44:17.451
And you lose your age very much.

00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:21.161
You feel very dynamic; at the same time very
compassionate.

00:44:21.161 --> 00:44:26.031
As you know I’m seventy-one years of age
and I’m traveling practically every third

00:44:26.031 --> 00:44:27.031
day.

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:28.031
And it’s all right.

00:44:28.031 --> 00:44:29.511
People said “Mother, don’t you feel you
are traveling too much?”

00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:31.891
I said, “I’m not traveling, I’m just
sitting everywhere.

00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:34.861
Where am I traveling?”

00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:37.361
In the same way, it happens to you.

00:44:37.361 --> 00:44:44.081
And the ageing and all that never comes into
your mind.

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:48.631
You just live; live in the present.

00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:54.131
And you just enjoy life; enjoy the company
of all other realized souls.

00:44:54.131 --> 00:44:55.451
All over the world you have relations.

00:44:55.451 --> 00:45:01.051
Wherever you go they’ll be all there to
help you, to look after you.

00:45:01.051 --> 00:45:05.941
Something happens to one person, all over
the world they will try to help, the doctors

00:45:05.941 --> 00:45:13.931
will run to that place, people will pray,
and I mean they will see to it that the person

00:45:13.931 --> 00:45:14.931
is saved.

00:45:14.931 --> 00:45:21.801
It’s such a big family, such a beautiful
family into which I would request you to join.

00:45:21.801 --> 00:45:31.241
May God bless you!

00:45:31.241 --> 00:45:40.951
Now, I cannot force self realization, cannot
be done, because I respect your freedom.

00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:48.541
You are given freedom at a human level because
you have to ascent with your own, with your

00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:53.421
own desire, I cannot force on you anything.

00:45:53.421 --> 00:46:01.931
As you have to accept it that you want to
have it.

00:46:01.931 --> 00:46:06.971
I would request people who don’t want to
have it, they should leave the hall and leave

00:46:06.971 --> 00:46:12.611
others, but those who want to have it are
very welcome, and they can have it.

00:46:12.611 --> 00:46:18.381
Even the knowledge they can have it without
any difficulties.

00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:26.741
So all those who want to go away should leave
the hall, please, I will be very thankful,

00:46:26.741 --> 00:46:30.171
because it cannot work on people who do not
want it.

00:46:30.171 --> 00:46:35.121
On the contrary it doesn’t help others also
to have such people among you who don’t

00:46:35.121 --> 00:46:44.751
want to have it.

00:46:44.751 --> 00:46:54.601
It will take hardly ten minutes and I would
request you not to disturb others when we

00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:57.211
are in the process of it.

00:46:57.211 --> 00:47:04.011
Actually it happens spontaneously without
anything but as there are little problems

00:47:04.011 --> 00:47:09.921
on the centers, you have to nourish your centers
yourself as I’ll tell you, its very simple

00:47:09.921 --> 00:49:27.351
and will show you how we do it.
