00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:16.882
But this is what auspiciousness is: that
you to feel it from your heart

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:21.695
which is awakened. The heart must be
awakened.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.691
In the heart resides the Spirit,

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:32.226
which is not yet flowing in our
consciousness,

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:41.196
in our central nervous system.
It resides there, the joy itself.

00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:46.675
I don’t know if you have ever seen
phosphorus taken out of the water

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:52.510
and how it just gets ignited -

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:59.542
it is like that: inside the maya,
the illusion, that spark is sitting down,

00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:04.697
and when this Kundalini rises and touches
that spark,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:10.281
it starts emitting its joy,
its auspiciousness.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:12.632
Unless and until you have that within you,

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:17.511
you cannot feel the auspiciousness
of others.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.167
Take a coconut, for example:

00:01:22.368 --> 00:01:26.875
put it the other way round, you won’t
get vibrations.

00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:33.150
If you put it this way [with] the coconut
coming up you will get more vibrations.

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:36.987
There are certain coconuts who give you
very good vibrations,

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:40.339
some give horrible vibrations.

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:46.852
And you know human beings also have
coconuts!

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:57.339
Some of the coconuts give such beautiful
vibrations and some of them do not.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.137
Some of them are tired.

00:02:00.338 --> 00:02:08.561
Some of them are nothing but like
a balloon of Mr Ego.

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:12.381
Or some of them have nothing but superego
in them.

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:18.140
So this coconut is to be made auspicious.

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:26.138
Now, how it is connected with Spirit,
that is a very important point:

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:31.178
how our brain is connected with Spirit.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.755
Whatever I am telling you, you need not
believe Me,

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:42.285
but you will find it out for yourself that,
whatever I am saying is the Truth.

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:47.610
Your heart has the Spirit, the light,

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:54.729
and the heart has got seven auras
around it.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:06.968
And these seven auras get enlightened
by the Spirit.

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:17.716
But before that it’s a very instantaneous
or we can say a simultaneous happening.

00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:22.018
When the Kundalini rises there are seven
centres

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.857
also in our brain, in the sense [that]
there are the seats of the centres.

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:31.868
These seven centres are represented again
on the seat, you know that very well.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.935
All the Sahaja Yogis know where they are.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:47.132
So when these centres are enlightened,
the auras start shining in the heart.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.135
And this centre (Brahmarandhra) is actually
the seat of the Spirit.

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:58.918
The Spirit has moved from there and
has gone to the heart:

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:03.157
that’s why in childhood you will find
there’s an opening here.

00:04:03.358 --> 00:04:11.574
It’s a very soft bone, called as fontanelle
bone, talu, is here.

00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:16.112
Because the Spirit comes out from there
and is settled on the heart.

00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:22.332
You know, Spirit also comes out in the
night sometimes, goes round and sees.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:30.018
It’s so. When these centres in our brain
get enlightened by Kundalini,

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:36.741
one by one, first they are enlightened
here, then in the brain,

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:41.719
then the auras in the heart start getting
enlightened.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.566
Ultimately when this centre - which is
the centre of the heart here,

00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:54.056
Sahastrara, in this point -

00:04:56.104 --> 00:05:06.616
when this one gets enlightened, then
the Spirit also gets enlightened, fully;

00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:13.473
and then these auras become doubly shining.

00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:22.075
Then the auspiciousness is in many
dimensions starts expressing itself.

00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:29.384
But to keep that light on, one has to keep
the Kundalini over here.

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:39.951
Then what happens? Then we are ruled
by our heart’s indication

00:05:40.152 --> 00:05:46.490
[rather] than by our brain. How?
Because the heart has the Spirit,

00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:51.966
which emits vibrations, it’s not the brain.

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:57.393
And you depend on your vibratory awareness
after Realisation.

00:05:57.594 --> 00:06:00.258
The more you depend on your vibratory
awareness,

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:05.928
the more you use your heart, your Spirit,
not your brain.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.078
The more you use your brain, again you
go down,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.891
because it is taken over now by the Spirit.

00:06:14.092 --> 00:06:17.741
For example: after Realisation when you
start thinking about it…

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:20.802
I mean, people can think of anything!
I mean, I can tell you,

00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:24.695
I have had such experiences that they
would think that,

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:26.670
“Why Mataji is wearing a sari like this?”

00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:30.570
Even to this extent you see they can
go [to]!

00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.792
But if you can just leave your heart
to work it out and don’t think,

00:06:34.993 --> 00:06:37.235
because you are in thoughtless awareness
after Realisation.

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:39.203
If you try to maintain that state,

00:06:39.404 --> 00:06:43.959
pay attention to your heart and let your
Spirit emit itself,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.406
so that it clears out completely the
confusion of the brain and everything;

00:06:51.622 --> 00:06:56.549
then you will be amazed that you cannot
lose your vibrations.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.349
You cannot lose your Realisation.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.221
The simplest way is - I mean, we have
found like this -

00:07:05.422 --> 00:07:09.913
that after Realisation if you go for seven
days treatment

00:07:10.114 --> 00:07:12.726
with soaking feet before My photograph
it works out.

00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:16.706
But immediately when I say,
“My photograph”: finished!

00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:23.506
The ego comes up: “Why her photograph?”
First thing comes up: “Who is She?”

00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:27.625
I may be nothing - all right, agreed,
I am nothing -

00:07:27.826 --> 00:07:32.961
but I have raised your Kundalini! I have
given you Realisation!

00:07:33.162 --> 00:07:37.019
I must be something after all.

00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:45.739
So why worry? I am not taking away anything
from you.

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:53.400
Then you start establishing your
auspiciousness, the sense of auspiciousness.

00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:59.266
Once you have established it, then you
do not lose it very easily.

00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:02.097
You don’t like then inauspicious things,
normally.

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:07.365
If there is somebody inauspicious you say,
“Mother, no.

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:10.685
We can’t do anything about this gentleman”.
All right.

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:16.314
Afterwards when you become very strong you
don’t mind working on anyone whatsoever.

00:08:16.515 --> 00:08:20.245
But gradually you have to grow up to it.
I understand that.

00:08:20.446 --> 00:08:24.751
But I can’t understand people using their
rationality to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:24.952 --> 00:08:35.145
How can you understand this great power
with your limited rationality?

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:42.619
I can explain to an ant about your
politics,

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:49.455
but I cannot tell you how this divine power
works.

00:08:52.831 --> 00:09:04.599
One day he asked Me, Djamel, numerically:
to what extent it goes, to what dimension?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.696
And when I told him he said,
“It is incalculable.”

00:09:07.897 --> 00:09:11.125
I said, “It is an infinite! You cannot
calculate.”

00:09:11.326 --> 00:09:17.790
If you put two mirrors facing each other
and put some object in between,

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:27.701
you cannot calculate how many reflections
you will get.

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.579
Even that you see, but you cannot
calculate.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:38.035
But here I am talking about something that
does that, which creates these things.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:47.590
You cannot calculate all the molecules
and the atoms of one element,

00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.105
but I am talking about Somebody who has
created them

00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:57.174
and who, in every molecule, pulsates.

00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:03.456
How can you understand with this brain?

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:07.225
You can only become one with It and enjoy
yourself! Why worry?

00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:11.547
Why do you want to count the molecules?

00:10:14.073 --> 00:10:17.267
Why this madness?

00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:27.754
It would be like a madman going to
the seashore to have a nice bath,

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:37.280
starts counting the small little pebbles
and the grains of the sand.

00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:43.015
Get in! Enjoy! You become that.

00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:49.548
This is advaita, where you become one.
All religions teach advaita.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:54.366
Advaita means where there is not
the other, ananya.

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:59.044
You become one with that. With the whole
ocean you become one.

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:04.871
[When] a drop becomes the ocean, all the
powers of the oceans are there for the drop.

00:11:05.072 --> 00:11:07.511
That’s what it is.

00:11:09.513 --> 00:11:12.848
But there are some people who say,
“We believe in dvaita (duality),

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:18.557
No, why, we don’t want to get lost.”
Then you are not lost!

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:21.968
You become the whole!

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:26.203
But they want to keep their small
limitations, you see.

00:11:26.404 --> 00:11:31.242
Now what is that small limitation they
want to keep?

00:11:33.461 --> 00:11:39.924
It’s called as Mr E-G-O,

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:49.364
which is a myth, which is a myth.
It’s such a big myth this ego:

00:11:49.565 --> 00:11:54.341
because what do you do, human beings?
Let’s see now.

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:58.528
What do you do? You make a chair,
all right.

00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:02.565
[You] see, people are even proud if they
can make a chair these days,

00:12:02.766 --> 00:12:05.274
because nobody can use their hands these
days, you know that,

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.357
with everything done by machines.

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:14.198
I don’t know, they cannot create human
beings, otherwise they may try that also.

00:12:15.328 --> 00:12:21.239
So what do you do? You create something
dead out of dead.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.077
Everything is dead. Whatever you have
created is dead!

00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:30.984
Have you done any living work? So one
lady got very angry with Me.

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.430
She said, “Yes, we have created a tube
baby.”

00:12:33.631 --> 00:12:37.675
I said, “You have not created,
it was all there. The life was there.

00:12:37.876 --> 00:12:41.145
You just brought it together and it worked
out that way. It’s nothing!”

00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:45.814
It’s just like [an] egg being -

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:50.376
what do you say that? Egg that put
in the - incubator.

00:12:50.777 --> 00:12:53.165
It is that! [A] simple thing! You have done
nothing!

00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:56.743
You have put life into it, have you?

00:12:56.944 --> 00:13:01.653
Let us confess it now. We cannot convert
even one flower,

00:13:01.854 --> 00:13:07.956
transform one flower into a fruit.
Let us admit it.

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:12.098
So what is this ego, then? “I do this
and I do this,”

00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:16.979
“I would like that and I would have this”
and “I, I, I.”

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.049
Who is this ‘Mr I’ who cannot do one living
thing?

00:13:25.314 --> 00:13:29.525
Just ask yourself. [It’s a] very simple
question.

00:13:29.956 --> 00:13:35.887
So, you reach a conclusion, it’s a myth!
We do not do anything!

00:13:36.088 --> 00:13:39.045
As many times I have told you that,
some people going by train

00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:41.259
put all their luggage on their heads.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.997
So they said, “Why are you carrying
so much luggage on your head?”

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:50.084
They said, “Because we want to reduce
the weight of the train.”

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:56.994
This ego is like that: put it on your head!
“I do it! I do it! I do it!”

00:13:57.195 --> 00:14:02.318
But by brainwashing you I cannot reduce it.
How [then]?

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:06.171
The myth has to be broken.

00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:11.697
The myth breaks when Kundalini rises.

00:14:11.898 --> 00:14:15.342
Then how you talk is a very different
language:

00:14:15.543 --> 00:14:20.299
“It is not coming.” “It is not going.”
It is ‘it’. It becomes a third person.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.953
Then your power, which is flowing through
your hands,

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:26.036
you see that going through your hands,
which you are manoeuvring.

00:14:26.237 --> 00:14:30.778
You don’t say, “I am giving you Realisation!”
you don’t say.

00:14:30.979 --> 00:14:34.351
You just say, “It is going.” “It is rising.”
“It is not coming.”

00:14:34.552 --> 00:14:39.823
Even if it is your son you will say,
“I cannot give, now what to do?”

00:14:40.154 --> 00:14:43.051
Like a lady came with Me to America
once and

00:14:43.252 --> 00:14:46.568
she was very anxious that I must give
Realisation to her son and all that.

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:52.591
So I told her, “Look at this. Now you have
come all the way, I know, for this purpose.

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:56.804
But now if the Kundalini doesn’t rise,
should you want Me to say

00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:59.324
that he is realised?” “No, no, no, no,
Mataji, I know it doesn’t rise.”

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:03.327
Then I said, “You give him a Realisation.
I cannot give him. All right, you try.”

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:06.141
Then, “But it doesn’t rise!” I said,
“Then what to do?

00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:09.777
If the Kundalini is not coming up, what
can we do about it?”

00:15:09.978 --> 00:15:15.342
So, the Kundalini has to come
spontaneously. It’s a living process.

00:15:15.543 --> 00:15:20.490
But after Realisation you start doing
living things.

00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:26.711
You can raise the Kundalini. You can
pulsate the Kundalini.

00:15:26.912 --> 00:15:30.514
I don’t know about pulsation: so far I have
not seen any Sahaja Yogi doing it.

00:15:30.715 --> 00:15:35.628
But you can raise it all right. You can
give Realisation:

00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:39.920
with My photograph it works better.

00:15:40.121 --> 00:15:45.461
You can give vibrations now to the plants,
to the fruit,

00:15:45.662 --> 00:15:52.664
or to any, any flower like this. If it is
dying, it will come to life.

00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:59.727
If you give vibrations say, to a field of,
or seeds of, say wheat,

00:15:59.928 --> 00:16:05.824
they can be multiplied: they can be ten
times more than what they were.

00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:13.696
Now you have started giving vibrations
to the trees, to the people,

00:16:13.897 --> 00:16:20.415
you are doing the living work. Now you
have become the ocean of life.

00:16:20.616 --> 00:16:25.738
So far you were not. Because the power
of life

00:16:25.939 --> 00:16:30.483
[which] is to give life, has come in you.

00:16:33.751 --> 00:16:39.997
Now you are living. Before this you were
dead,

00:16:40.198 --> 00:16:45.210
in the sense that you were worshipping
a dead god called ‘ego’,

00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:50.158
now it’s the living God within you -
is the Spirit.

00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:56.038
Once you start accepting your Spirit,
all your priorities change just like that,

00:16:56.239 --> 00:17:00.028
because Spirit is joy and happiness.

00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:06.148
Spirit is everything, so you start losing
all your interest into other things.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:13.007
If this is what is, then your auspiciousness
is of the greatest height,

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:19.212
that even your name can create something
great,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.654
and photograph can do wonders.

00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:30.155
If you become auspiciousness, you are
the holiest of the holy.

00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:36.731
For that we have to get rid of some
of the dirt and the dust,

00:17:36.932 --> 00:17:40.999
we have to get rid of some of the false
notions we have and the myths of being -

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.960
some people have a myth that they
are guilty and some people,

00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:49.964
as I told you, have so many myths. But
for giving up, this Kundalini works out.

00:17:50.165 --> 00:17:56.084
You allow Her to work it out, that’s all.
It works.

00:17:57.107 --> 00:18:00.225
May God bless you.
