SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,270
CABELLA

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:25,099
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

5
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:46,810
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

6
00:00:46,810 --> 00:01:01,949
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

7
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,100
you have achieved we have to see it.

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:25,899
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

9
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:37,260
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

10
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:46,149
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

11
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,850
It’s established.

12
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,270
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

13
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:04,790
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

14
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:12,630
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

15
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,030
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

16
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:29,480
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

17
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:37,300
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

18
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:48,140
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

19
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,599
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

20
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:05,090
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

21
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:18,540
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

22
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:32,319
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

23
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,790
also starts flowing with it.

24
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:44,930
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

25
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:55,290
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

26
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,180
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

27
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,500
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

28
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,090
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

29
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,080
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

30
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,340
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:32,699
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

32
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,180
go to them.

33
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:47,180
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

34
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,500
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

35
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:59,910
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

36
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:10,210
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

37
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,360
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

38
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:26,830
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

39
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:36,889
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

40
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,590
No one can harm you.

41
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,830
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

42
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:56,930
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

43
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:05,000
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

44
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,449
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

45
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,210
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

46
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:25,430
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

47
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,710
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

48
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:40,380
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

49
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,860
He is a religious man.

50
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,640
He should also put stones on her.

51
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,940
But He was standing on truth.

52
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:58,449
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

53
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,370
that you stand on truth.

54
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:10,740
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

55
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:20,000
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

56
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,950
to the left.

57
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:33,349
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

58
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:38,389
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

59
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,690
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

60
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:50,880
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,789
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

62
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,880
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

63
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,759
way do that way.

64
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,750
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

65
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:21,580
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

66
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,080
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

67
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:38,979
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

68
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,979
religion even about Sahaj religion.

69
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:50,910
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

70
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,910
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

71
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:04,510
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

72
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,120
he is in that truth.

73
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:17,120
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

74
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,160
to all of you.

75
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,950
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

76
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:34,040
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

77
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,190
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

78
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,360
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

79
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:55,380
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

80
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,650
on truth or untruth.

81
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:04,980
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

82
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:12,320
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

83
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,620
branches in the body.

84
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,610
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

85
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,450
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

86
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:39,310
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

87
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,560
we have taken.

88
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,450
We have now become dharmic.

89
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,980
What is the root of dharma?

90
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,400
Why should we be dharmic?

91
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,820
What is the need to be dharmic?

92
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,280
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

93
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,350
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

94
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:14,430
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

95
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,950
enjoyments of these people.

96
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:29,830
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

97
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,900
standing on truth.

98
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:38,250
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

99
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,080
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

100
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:55,350
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

101
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,300
even their language improves.

102
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:08,040
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

103
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,210
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

104
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,370
This consciousness has to disappear.

105
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:37,190
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

106
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,810
is truth.

107
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:46,460
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

108
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,480
As you know the pita of heart is here.

109
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:59,640
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

110
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,170
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

111
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:14,460
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

112
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:20,430
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

113
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:31,730
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

114
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,320
love, the pure love.

115
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:44,060
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

116
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:52,520
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

117
00:13:52,520 --> 00:14:06,760
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

118
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,690
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

119
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:23,720
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

120
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,160
- that’s the personality you have to become.

121
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:37,940
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

122
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:44,830
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

123
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,200
person.

124
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,160
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

125
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
things.

126
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:07,360
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

127
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,540
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

128
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,520
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

129
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,250
here you are talking like this.

130
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:29,130
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

131
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:36,180
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

132
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:45,480
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

133
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:55,630
to say things by which they become one, united.

134
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:03,250
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

135
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:14,490
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

136
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:21,191
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

137
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:31,570
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

138
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,810
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

139
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:47,410
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

140
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,670
collective consciousness.

141
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,000
Now people talk of peace.

142
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,410
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

143
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:12,709
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

144
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:24,290
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

145
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,290
fulfilling.

146
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:35,360
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

147
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:44,920
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

148
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:54,090
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

149
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:02,800
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

150
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,910
we can change this world.

151
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:17,310
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

152
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:23,510
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

153
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,740
Why do you hate someone.

154
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:33,470
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

155
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,920
sake.

156
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:42,390
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

157
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,930
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

158
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:56,450
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

159
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:05,880
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

160
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,320
This doesn’t stop.

161
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,510
By dividing us what has happened?

162
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:17,490
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

163
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:23,390
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

164
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,660
this that.

165
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,250
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

166
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,140
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

167
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:42,780
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

168
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,060
country being divided.

169
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:54,160
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

170
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:05,190
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

171
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:13,730
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

172
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:22,390
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

173
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,130
Why?

174
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,870
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

175
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,030
separate houses?

176
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,790
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

177
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:47,160
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

178
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,260
houses.

179
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:55,070
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

180
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:03,780
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

181
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,850
are catching.

182
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,930
Isn’t it?

183
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,160
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

184
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,590
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

185
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,590
understand.

186
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:25,130
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

187
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,820
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

188
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:37,740
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

189
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
to do.

190
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:46,660
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

191
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:55,290
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

192
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:01,870
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

193
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:09,660
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

194
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
that.

195
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:16,350
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

196
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,840
So there is nothing like that.

197
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,270
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

198
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,610
who tries all kinds of tricks.

199
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:40,330
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

200
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:52,260
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

201
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,590
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

202
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,690
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

203
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:10,150
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

204
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,700
common disease with Indians.

205
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,560
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

206
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,420
separate bathrooms.

207
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,030
In a collective life there is no need.

208
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:31,040
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

209
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,500
just go there come back, finished.

210
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,960
I have no time for all that.

211
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:48,770
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

212
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,580
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

213
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
union?

214
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,530
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

215
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:06,800
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

216
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,950
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

217
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:22,590
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

218
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,200
of Himalayas I should say.

219
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,250
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

220
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,370
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

221
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:49,800
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

222
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,620
of it.

223
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,180
So we have to be very, very careful.

224
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:11,330
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

225
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:21,930
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

226
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:28,220
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

227
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,840
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

228
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,530
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

229
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:53,281
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

230
00:25:53,281 --> 00:26:01,210
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

231
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:15,530
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

232
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,250
huge earthquake.

233
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:28,520
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

234
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,280
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

235
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,620
under protection.

236
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,590
You are all the time protected.

237
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,700
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

238
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,420
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

239
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,300
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

240
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:01,140
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

241
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,370
is protecting you and helping you.

242
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:11,559
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

243
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:17,000
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

244
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,940
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

245
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,320
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

246
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,810
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

247
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,070
All these topics will fall.

248
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,240
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

249
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,500
No question.

250
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,570
What do I like?

251
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:57,200
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

252
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
to be this way.

253
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Who are you?

254
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,650
Ask yourself the question.

255
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,200
Who are you?

256
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:16,200
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

257
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,470
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

258
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,920
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

259
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,020
This is what you have to reach.

260
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,980
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

261
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:46,410
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

262
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,270
You have to work it out.

263
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:55,800
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

264
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,600
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

265
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,640
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

266
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:11,080
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

267
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,350
what about my country.

268
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,660
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

269
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,530
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

270
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:37,980
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

271
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,330
I, I.

272
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:48,309
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

273
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:52,380
for the cleaning of the cotton.

274
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:59,059
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

275
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:05,110
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

276
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,380
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

277
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:17,950
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

278
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:24,870
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

279
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:34,630
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

280
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:43,480
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

281
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:52,080
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

282
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,050
they plan something very bad.

283
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,809
They can do anything.

284
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,320
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

285
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,810
they don’t do it.

286
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,920
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

287
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:15,800
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

288
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,410
fuss about food.

289
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:24,140
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

290
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,390
- that we are like this, we are that.

291
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:34,940
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

292
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,120
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

293
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,200
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

294
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,950
I said ‘What?’

295
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,840
I couldn’t understand the question.

296
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,611
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

297
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:57,250
is there to be proud?

298
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:03,300
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

299
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,370
of.

300
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:11,900
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

301
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:20,880
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

302
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,270
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

303
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:33,049
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

304
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:36,250
it, not at all conscious.

305
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,170
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

306
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,770
But it is so, what to do.

307
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:47,320
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

308
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,100
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

309
00:32:53,100 --> 00:33:00,280
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

310
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:09,970
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

311
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:19,809
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

312
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:20,809
gold’ - gold is gold.

313
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:24,130
Why will it be proud of that?

314
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:33,500
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

315
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:40,020
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

316
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,660
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

317
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,590
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

318
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:53,480
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

319
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,179
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

320
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:07,059
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

321
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:14,179
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

322
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,730
left in me.

323
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:22,110
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

324
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:28,780
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

325
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:39,649
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

326
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:49,960
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

327
00:34:49,960 --> 00:35:03,710
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

328
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:11,960
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

329
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,520
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

330
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:25,510
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

331
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:32,650
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

332
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,530
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

333
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:44,580
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

334
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,100
false, so how to make these two things meet.

335
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:58,260
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

336
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
primamvadeth.

337
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:06,820
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

338
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:15,430
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

339
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:21,950
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

340
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:28,420
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

341
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:36,550
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

342
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,520
said to me that I have done something perfect.

343
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:48,210
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

344
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:54,340
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

345
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,100
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

346
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,300
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

347
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,010
All this is the play of ego.

348
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,070
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

349
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,300
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

350
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:20,540
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

351
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:28,730
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

352
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,171
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

353
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:37,900
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

354
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,880
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

355
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
do?

356
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,690
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

357
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,490
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

358
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:01,610
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

359
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,510
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

360
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:11,220
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

361
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,470
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

362
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,450
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

363
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:28,109
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

364
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:34,020
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

365
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,280
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

366
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,730
all the knowledge.

367
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:47,220
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

368
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:56,820
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

369
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:05,440
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

370
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,270
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

371
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,300
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

372
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,200
We have to think of the whole world.

373
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,251
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

374
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:25,841
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

375
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:29,890
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

376
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:35,430
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

377
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,220
So I am trying to do something for them.

378
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,100
You have problems in your countries.

379
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,080
You should find out what problems there are.

380
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:50,609
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

381
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:57,490
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

382
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:03,050
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

383
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,200
to do it.

384
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,030
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

385
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,030
up.

386
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:15,609
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

387
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:18,700
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

388
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,610
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

389
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:30,080
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

390
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,450
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

391
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,560
You are powerful.

392
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,570
You have powers.

393
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,440
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

394
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,070
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

395
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:55,800
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

396
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,599
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

397
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:09,680
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

398
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,570
that we are chosen.

399
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:20,690
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

400
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:25,850
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

401
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,800
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

402
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,180
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

403
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,270
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

404
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:54,470
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

405
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,960
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

406
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,640
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

407
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:15,970
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

408
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:22,130
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

409
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:30,080
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

410
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:40,570
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

411
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,770
is jealousy.

412
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:51,460
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

413
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:59,790
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

414
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:07,630
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

415
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:13,980
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

416
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:21,510
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

417
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:28,560
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

418
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,560
We should not.

419
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:39,540
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

420
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:47,220
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

421
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,990
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

422
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:58,250
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

423
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,170
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

424
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,920
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

425
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,520
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

426
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,050
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

427
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:23,580
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

428
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:30,950
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

429
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:31,950
bad.

430
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:39,790
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

431
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:47,080
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

432
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,090
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

433
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:59,560
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

434
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:06,080
dominating others, without showing off.

435
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:14,090
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

436
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:23,210
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

437
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:32,160
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

438
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:40,740
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

439
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,220
and get it.

440
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:52,090
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

441
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,130
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

442
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,920
Nothing!

443
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:12,300
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

444
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:21,940
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

445
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:28,520
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

446
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:34,810
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

447
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:43,200
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

448
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,760
That is not the idea.

449
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:52,770
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

450
00:46:52,770 --> 00:47:09,470
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

451
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:18,440
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

452
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:29,599
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

453
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,170
realm of God.

454
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,540
That is what you are here for.

455
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,540
May God bless you.
