00:12.412 --> 00:16.203
Gauri is the Mother of Shri Ganesha

00:22.236 --> 00:25.361
and She produced Shri Ganesha because

00:26.954 --> 00:29.370
She was having a bath,

00:30.203 --> 00:32.704
and to protect Her

00:34.036 --> 00:37.453
chastity She created Shri Ganesha.

00:39.912 --> 00:42.120
In the same way,

00:46.412 --> 00:49.162
Kundalini is the Gauri

00:49.662 --> 00:53.203
and we have got Ganesha sitting

00:54.996 --> 00:57.579
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:58.036 --> 01:01.579
So we have Mooladhara as

01:03.412 --> 01:08.620
the abode of the Gauri, of Kundalini,

01:09.871 --> 01:15.203
and the protection of the Kundalini is done by Shri Ganesha.

01:16.454 --> 01:19.704
As you know, Shri Ganesha is the deity

01:20.495 --> 01:24.787
which is for our innocence.

01:26.787 --> 01:33.620
Only Shri Ganesha could be there in that position

01:35.370 --> 01:37.537
because as you know the pelvic plexus looks after

01:37.746 --> 01:41.829
all the excretory functions,

01:42.078 --> 01:47.579
and it is Shri Ganesha only who can really stay there

01:49.120 --> 01:51.287
without getting

01:56.287 --> 01:59.704
dirtied by the surroundings

02:00.036 --> 02:06.078
He is so pure; He is so innocent â€“

02:09.954 --> 02:14.746
while the Kundalini is the virgin,

02:16.746 --> 02:20.036
the virgin Mother of Shri Ganesha.

02:21.203 --> 02:25.829
People have started talking against

02:27.036 --> 02:30.370
Mary by saying that there was something wrong:

02:30.787 --> 02:33.787
"How could a virgin get a child?"

02:35.912 --> 02:39.454
Because we do not understand it is God

02:41.036 --> 02:45.245
and in the area of God anything is possible.

02:47.037 --> 02:49.996
They're above all these things

02:51.912 --> 02:54.579
and they can create anything

02:57.162 --> 02:59.287
and in any way

02:59.495 --> 03:02.662
Ganesha had to be born out of a virgin

03:02.871 --> 03:06.871
because He was so pure.

03:10.412 --> 03:14.537
So Kundalini has to be supported by Shri Ganesha.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.620
If Shri Ganesha is weak,

03:17.954 --> 03:21.495
then Kundalini cannot be supported.

03:23.662 --> 03:27.245
Shri Ganesha has to support Her

03:29.579 --> 03:32.912
in the awakening part first of all.

03:33.412 --> 03:37.078
When the Kundalini is getting awakened,

03:38.412 --> 03:41.537
Shri Ganesha stops all the functions

03:42.162 --> 03:44.037
that it has to perform.

03:44.328 --> 03:47.036
All the functions are stopped

03:49.245 --> 03:50.829
so that

03:51.954 --> 03:53.871
you must have seen, I sit for nine hours,

03:54.078 --> 03:58.120
ten hours sometimes - I don't get up,

03:59.245 --> 04:01.203
because all functions of Shri Ganesha,

04:01.412 --> 04:05.829
everything stops when the Kundalini is rising.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.912
She is fully supported

04:09.537 --> 04:12.662
and looked after by Shri Ganesha.

04:20.829 --> 04:23.829
The Kundalini is the energy that you know

04:24.245 --> 04:26.578
which gives you your ascent,

04:27.746 --> 04:30.162
but it's a virgin energy.

04:31.036 --> 04:34.912
It's a energy that is detached;

04:36.036 --> 04:40.287
it doesn't get attached to any center,

04:41.829 --> 04:45.287
to any function.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.036
Only one function it has to do,

04:49.662 --> 04:51.203
is to

04:53.746 --> 04:56.245
slowly and steadily

05:00.328 --> 05:03.119
pass through all these centers,

05:04.036 --> 05:07.662
nourish them, give them whatever they like,

05:07.871 --> 05:10.829
whatever they want, whatever they can bear,

05:11.912 --> 05:15.996
and slowly and steadily open the Sahasrara.

05:17.454 --> 05:19.412
She is coiled up in three and a half

05:21.162 --> 05:23.078
coils.

05:23.328 --> 05:25.328
It has a mathematical significance

05:25.579 --> 05:29.494
why three and a half coils she is

05:30.036 --> 05:33.037
- I think in My book I have described about her.

05:35.245 --> 05:36.245
But

05:46.454 --> 05:48.995
though she's a virgin energy,

05:49.328 --> 05:51.036
still she is so wise,

05:51.245 --> 05:53.037
so sensible,

05:53.662 --> 05:56.620
so loving and so caring

05:57.287 --> 05:59.078
that when she rises

05:59.287 --> 06:02.120
She doesn't give any complications to you.

06:06.245 --> 06:10.287
She doesn't even make you feel that she's rising up.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.704
In some people she does,

06:11.912 --> 06:14.287
when the people are not normal,

06:14.495 --> 06:17.704
and some obstruction is there, then you do feel it;

06:18.579 --> 06:20.537
but normally

06:21.537 --> 06:24.454
you do not even feel how she is rising.

06:26.162 --> 06:28.954
She goes up in a way

06:30.787 --> 06:32.495
automatically,

06:33.454 --> 06:36.704
supported by the whole mechanism

06:37.912 --> 06:41.412
when she rises from one center to another center.

06:42.954 --> 06:47.244
The lower center first opens for her to enter in

06:47.495 --> 06:51.579
and then it augments, it closes down

06:51.829 --> 06:54.579
so that it can keep the Kundalini in its place,

06:54.829 --> 06:56.829
then it goes higher,

06:57.370 --> 07:03.787
there again till it pierces through Sahasrara,

07:04.120 --> 07:10.078
this ascending of Kundalini goes on.

07:14.429 --> 07:19.970
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner

07:20.179 --> 07:24.803
that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.845
The chakras are cleansed out

07:29.137 --> 07:34.054
and ultimately you are in a state of meditation.

07:34.887 --> 07:39.095
It's not a question of how to go into meditation,

07:44.054 --> 07:46.137
but is the question

07:47.720 --> 07:51.845
how to be in meditation all the time.

07:53.220 --> 07:56.387
So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches

07:57.387 --> 07:59.387
the Agnya Chakra

07:59.596 --> 08:02.262
and when She opens Agnya chakra,

08:03.762 --> 08:08.054
then you can be in thoughtless awareness,

08:08.720 --> 08:11.845
then you don't think - thinking just stops.

08:12.054 --> 08:16.928
You watch everything, just watch,

08:17.636 --> 08:20.429
but you do not get involved into what you are watching,

08:20.636 --> 08:26.304
but you just watch and that watching itself

08:27.554 --> 08:30.596
gives you the growth within.

08:31.137 --> 08:35.762
Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil or

08:35.970 --> 08:39.970
during earthquake: it won't grow.

08:41.471 --> 08:43.387
When the earthquake stops,

08:43.596 --> 08:45.887
everything becomes quiet,

08:46.137 --> 08:47.637
everything is peaceful,

08:47.845 --> 08:49.636
then only the tree can grow.

08:49.803 --> 08:52.803
In the same way, our growth can only take place

08:53.054 --> 08:55.678
if we are peaceful within ourselves.

08:56.512 --> 09:01.762
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider

09:02.012 --> 09:04.262
and rising higher and higher,

09:04.471 --> 09:06.220
first thing is we must have

09:06.429 --> 09:08.636
peace within ourselves,

09:09.845 --> 09:12.887
but this peace is possible if you can make really

09:13.137 --> 09:14.637
peace with others.

09:15.387 --> 09:17.720
If you cannot make peace with others

09:17.928 --> 09:20.304
who are in Sahaja Yoga,

09:20.636 --> 09:22.387
who are in the collective,

09:22.636 --> 09:26.845
if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

09:27.429 --> 09:31.012
That is why collectivity is so important.

09:31.636 --> 09:35.262
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open,

09:36.012 --> 09:37.845
and without collectivity

09:38.095 --> 09:42.637
you cannot have the growth of your spirituality.

09:44.554 --> 09:46.636
It's the growth of the spirituality

09:46.845 --> 09:50.802
as they say the Tree of Life is upside down

09:51.012 --> 09:53.803
and the roots are in the brain,

09:54.137 --> 09:58.429
and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

10:00.095 --> 10:02.636
as we water the roots.

10:02.887 --> 10:05.429
Then it starts growing downward

10:05.636 --> 10:08.220
and that's how you start expanding.

10:08.429 --> 10:11.220
When you start expanding, then you touch

10:11.471 --> 10:13.471
the depth of your divinity.

10:13.678 --> 10:16.346
And once you have touched the depth of your divinity,

10:16.596 --> 10:21.262
then you start working it out in such a manner

10:21.471 --> 10:25.553
that people will know that you are yogiji:

10:25.720 --> 10:28.636
you are people of higher realm,

10:28.803 --> 10:30.678
you have something great.

10:30.928 --> 10:35.054
It's not how many times you read something,

10:35.262 --> 10:38.054
it's not how many times you talk about Sahaja Yoga,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.970
it's not even how many times

10:41.179 --> 10:43.512
you just go on reciting names;

10:43.928 --> 10:47.678
but how many times from your heart

10:48.054 --> 10:51.095
your pure desire is to ascend.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.303
If this pure desire cuts upon you,

10:54.554 --> 10:56.720
then the first thing and the last thing you'll do

10:56.970 --> 11:00.012
is to meditate - you can't do without it.

11:00.596 --> 11:02.635
Even if you try, you can't do without it.

11:02.845 --> 11:06.637
If you will sleep without meditating, you'll think: "Oh,

11:07.220 --> 11:09.596
I have not meditated" - not out of guilt,

11:09.762 --> 11:11.596
but "I have missed something,

11:11.845 --> 11:12.927
I have missed something."

11:13.262 --> 11:14.845
That should happen to us.

11:15.095 --> 11:18.553
So this power of Gauri has to be respected

11:18.762 --> 11:20.637
because she's our mother,

11:20.928 --> 11:22.803
she's our individual mother.

11:23.054 --> 11:25.387
She has given us second birth.

11:25.636 --> 11:28.887
She is the one who knows all about us;

11:29.095 --> 11:31.512
she's so gentle, so kind.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.802
How she slowly rises.

11:34.054 --> 11:35.471
She doesn't give us trouble;

11:35.637 --> 11:37.803
she takes all the trouble of penetrating

11:38.054 --> 11:41.845
through these centers and she gives us this second birth.

11:44.429 --> 11:46.596
Because she understands everything,

11:46.762 --> 11:49.803
she knows everything, she organizes everything,

11:50.054 --> 11:54.887
she brings forth all the beauty that you are.

11:55.137 --> 11:58.387
Once you start developing that beauty within yourself,

11:58.803 --> 12:01.554
then you'll be surprised how powerful you are;

12:01.762 --> 12:05.636
that all these things are of the same nature

12:05.803 --> 12:07.762
is the truth that you discover,

12:08.054 --> 12:13.845
is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy.

12:14.220 --> 12:16.970
You don't have to think that joy is separate,

12:17.262 --> 12:19.429
truth is different, beauty is different.

12:19.678 --> 12:22.346
Because we are not yet at that point

12:22.554 --> 12:25.137
we just take one facet,

12:25.471 --> 12:28.512
but once we reach that point then

12:29.012 --> 12:32.220
the whole thing seems to be one.

12:32.596 --> 12:36.845
There is no differentiation at all.

12:37.262 --> 12:38.637
It's all one.

12:38.887 --> 12:41.346
Many facets of a diamond

12:41.596 --> 12:42.970
but it's one diamond

12:43.220 --> 12:46.887
and that diamond is your self, your spirit.
