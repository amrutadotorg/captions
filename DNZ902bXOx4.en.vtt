00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:16.203
Gauri is the Mother of Shri Ganesha

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:25.361
and She produced Shri Ganesha because

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:29.370
She was having a bath,

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:32.704
and to protect Her

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:37.453
chastity She created Shri Ganesha.

00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:42.120
In the same way,

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:49.162
Kundalini is the Gauri

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:53.203
and we have got Ganesha sitting

00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:57.579
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:01.579
So we have Mooladhara as

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:08.620
the abode of the Gauri, of Kundalini,

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:15.203
and the protection of the Kundalini is done by Shri Ganesha.

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:19.704
As you know, Shri Ganesha is the deity

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:24.787
which is for our innocence.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:33.620
Only Shri Ganesha could be there in that position

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.537
because as you know the pelvic plexus looks after

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:41.829
all the excretory functions,

00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:47.579
and it is Shri Ganesha only who can really stay there

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.287
without getting

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:59.704
dirtied by the surroundings

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:06.078
He is so pure; He is so innocent â€“

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:14.746
while the Kundalini is the virgin,

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:20.036
the virgin Mother of Shri Ganesha.

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:25.829
People have started talking against

00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:30.370
Mary by saying that there was something wrong:

00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:33.787
"How could a virgin get a child?"

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:39.454
Because we do not understand it is God

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:45.245
and in the area of God anything is possible.

00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:49.996
They're above all these things

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.579
and they can create anything

00:02:57.162 --> 00:02:59.287
and in any way

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:02.662
Ganesha had to be born out of a virgin

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:06.871
because He was so pure.

00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:14.537
So Kundalini has to be supported by Shri Ganesha.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.620
If Shri Ganesha is weak,

00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:21.495
then Kundalini cannot be supported.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:27.245
Shri Ganesha has to support Her

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.912
in the awakening part first of all.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:37.078
When the Kundalini is getting awakened,

00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:41.537
Shri Ganesha stops all the functions

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:44.037
that it has to perform.

00:03:44.328 --> 00:03:47.036
All the functions are stopped

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:50.829
so that

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:53.871
you must have seen, I sit for nine hours,

00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:58.120
ten hours sometimes - I don't get up,

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:01.203
because all functions of Shri Ganesha,

00:04:01.412 --> 00:04:05.829
everything stops when the Kundalini is rising.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.912
She is fully supported

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:12.662
and looked after by Shri Ganesha.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.829
The Kundalini is the energy that you know

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:26.578
which gives you your ascent,

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:30.162
but it's a virgin energy.

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:34.912
It's a energy that is detached;

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:40.287
it doesn't get attached to any center,

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:45.287
to any function.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.036
Only one function it has to do,

00:04:49.662 --> 00:04:51.203
is to

00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:56.245
slowly and steadily

00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:03.119
pass through all these centers,

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:07.662
nourish them, give them whatever they like,

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.829
whatever they want, whatever they can bear,

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:15.996
and slowly and steadily open the Sahasrara.

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:19.412
She is coiled up in three and a half

00:05:21.162 --> 00:05:23.078
coils.

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:25.328
It has a mathematical significance

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:29.494
why three and a half coils she is

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:33.037
- I think in My book I have described about her.

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:36.245
But

00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:48.995
though she's a virgin energy,

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:51.036
still she is so wise,

00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:53.037
so sensible,

00:05:53.662 --> 00:05:56.620
so loving and so caring

00:05:57.287 --> 00:05:59.078
that when she rises

00:05:59.287 --> 00:06:02.120
She doesn't give any complications to you.

00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:10.287
She doesn't even make you feel that she's rising up.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.704
In some people she does,

00:06:11.912 --> 00:06:14.287
when the people are not normal,

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:17.704
and some obstruction is there, then you do feel it;

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.537
but normally

00:06:21.537 --> 00:06:24.454
you do not even feel how she is rising.

00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:28.954
She goes up in a way

00:06:30.787 --> 00:06:32.495
automatically,

00:06:33.454 --> 00:06:36.704
supported by the whole mechanism

00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:41.412
when she rises from one center to another center.

00:06:42.954 --> 00:06:47.244
The lower center first opens for her to enter in

00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:51.579
and then it augments, it closes down

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:54.579
so that it can keep the Kundalini in its place,

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:56.829
then it goes higher,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.787
there again till it pierces through Sahasrara,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.078
this ascending of Kundalini goes on.

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:19.970
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:24.803
that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated.

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:28.845
The chakras are cleansed out

00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:34.054
and ultimately you are in a state of meditation.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:39.095
It's not a question of how to go into meditation,

00:07:44.054 --> 00:07:46.137
but is the question

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.845
how to be in meditation all the time.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.387
So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches

00:07:57.387 --> 00:07:59.387
the Agnya Chakra

00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:02.262
and when She opens Agnya chakra,

00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:08.054
then you can be in thoughtless awareness,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.845
then you don't think - thinking just stops.

00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:16.928
You watch everything, just watch,

00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:20.429
but you do not get involved into what you are watching,

00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:26.304
but you just watch and that watching itself

00:08:27.554 --> 00:08:30.596
gives you the growth within.

00:08:31.137 --> 00:08:35.762
Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil or

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.970
during earthquake: it won't grow.

00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:43.387
When the earthquake stops,

00:08:43.596 --> 00:08:45.887
everything becomes quiet,

00:08:46.137 --> 00:08:47.637
everything is peaceful,

00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:49.636
then only the tree can grow.

00:08:49.803 --> 00:08:52.803
In the same way, our growth can only take place

00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:55.678
if we are peaceful within ourselves.

00:08:56.512 --> 00:09:01.762
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider

00:09:02.012 --> 00:09:04.262
and rising higher and higher,

00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:06.220
first thing is we must have

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:08.636
peace within ourselves,

00:09:09.845 --> 00:09:12.887
but this peace is possible if you can make really

00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:14.637
peace with others.

00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:17.720
If you cannot make peace with others

00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:20.304
who are in Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:22.387
who are in the collective,

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:26.845
if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:31.012
That is why collectivity is so important.

00:09:31.636 --> 00:09:35.262
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open,

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:37.845
and without collectivity

00:09:38.095 --> 00:09:42.637
you cannot have the growth of your spirituality.

00:09:44.554 --> 00:09:46.636
It's the growth of the spirituality

00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:50.802
as they say the Tree of Life is upside down

00:09:51.012 --> 00:09:53.803
and the roots are in the brain,

00:09:54.137 --> 00:09:58.429
and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

00:10:00.095 --> 00:10:02.636
as we water the roots.

00:10:02.887 --> 00:10:05.429
Then it starts growing downward

00:10:05.636 --> 00:10:08.220
and that's how you start expanding.

00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:11.220
When you start expanding, then you touch

00:10:11.471 --> 00:10:13.471
the depth of your divinity.

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:16.346
And once you have touched the depth of your divinity,

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:21.262
then you start working it out in such a manner

00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:25.553
that people will know that you are yogiji:

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.636
you are people of higher realm,

00:10:28.803 --> 00:10:30.678
you have something great.

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:35.054
It's not how many times you read something,

00:10:35.262 --> 00:10:38.054
it's not how many times you talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.970
it's not even how many times

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:43.512
you just go on reciting names;

00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:47.678
but how many times from your heart

00:10:48.054 --> 00:10:51.095
your pure desire is to ascend.

00:10:51.346 --> 00:10:54.303
If this pure desire cuts upon you,

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:56.720
then the first thing and the last thing you'll do

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.012
is to meditate - you can't do without it.

00:11:00.596 --> 00:11:02.635
Even if you try, you can't do without it.

00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:06.637
If you will sleep without meditating, you'll think: "Oh,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.596
I have not meditated" - not out of guilt,

00:11:09.762 --> 00:11:11.596
but "I have missed something,

00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:12.927
I have missed something."

00:11:13.262 --> 00:11:14.845
That should happen to us.

00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:18.553
So this power of Gauri has to be respected

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.637
because she's our mother,

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:22.803
she's our individual mother.

00:11:23.054 --> 00:11:25.387
She has given us second birth.

00:11:25.636 --> 00:11:28.887
She is the one who knows all about us;

00:11:29.095 --> 00:11:31.512
she's so gentle, so kind.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.802
How she slowly rises.

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:35.471
She doesn't give us trouble;

00:11:35.637 --> 00:11:37.803
she takes all the trouble of penetrating

00:11:38.054 --> 00:11:41.845
through these centers and she gives us this second birth.

00:11:44.429 --> 00:11:46.596
Because she understands everything,

00:11:46.762 --> 00:11:49.803
she knows everything, she organizes everything,

00:11:50.054 --> 00:11:54.887
she brings forth all the beauty that you are.

00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:58.387
Once you start developing that beauty within yourself,

00:11:58.803 --> 00:12:01.554
then you'll be surprised how powerful you are;

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:05.636
that all these things are of the same nature

00:12:05.803 --> 00:12:07.762
is the truth that you discover,

00:12:08.054 --> 00:12:13.845
is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.970
You don't have to think that joy is separate,

00:12:17.262 --> 00:12:19.429
truth is different, beauty is different.

00:12:19.678 --> 00:12:22.346
Because we are not yet at that point

00:12:22.554 --> 00:12:25.137
we just take one facet,

00:12:25.471 --> 00:12:28.512
but once we reach that point then

00:12:29.012 --> 00:12:32.220
the whole thing seems to be one.

00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:36.845
There is no differentiation at all.

00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:38.637
It's all one.

00:12:38.887 --> 00:12:41.346
Many facets of a diamond

00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:42.970
but it's one diamond

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.887
and that diamond is your self, your spirit.
