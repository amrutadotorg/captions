00:18:27.098 --> 00:18:34.497
Talk about all Chakras Errol Douglas, London (England), 2000-0928

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:38.498
I thank Mr. Emro

00:18:38.698 --> 00:18:44.698
for inviting Me to such a unique type of gathering.

00:18:48.978 --> 00:18:53.352
The subject is very interesting

00:18:53.553 --> 00:19:00.336
that how Sahaja Yoga can help beauty.

00:19:00.537 --> 00:19:03.917
Now Sahaja Yoga, as you know, here it is shown

00:19:04.118 --> 00:19:11.020
that there is a power in your triangular bone, here, as you see.

00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:17.221
And this is in every human being - every.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:29.058
And this power, has to be awakened.

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:31.819
Then it passes through these six centers.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.711
The seventh one low below there, the number one,

00:19:36.912 --> 00:19:42.951
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:19:43.152 --> 00:19:49.152
and connects you to the Divine.

00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:51.834
As a result of that,

00:19:52.035 --> 00:19:56.115
all these centers who are responsible, they are responsible

00:19:56.316 --> 00:20:01.076
for our physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual being,

00:20:01.277 --> 00:20:06.902
all of them are enlightened and integrated.

00:20:07.103 --> 00:20:09.803
It, this power is in everyone,

00:20:10.004 --> 00:20:14.468
but to talk about it, people don't believe in it.

00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:16.909
You must have the experience of it.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.550
And once you have the experience, you'll be amazed,

00:20:20.751 --> 00:20:26.956
how many things happen to you,
which you cannot even imagine.

00:20:27.157 --> 00:20:29.823
It's very kind of him to have called me here,

00:20:30.024 --> 00:20:33.358
that way I've met many people of that kind

00:20:33.558 --> 00:20:37.678
but nobody has tried to invite others

00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:41.598
who could share this experience.

00:20:41.798 --> 00:20:47.129
Now coming to the point of beauty,

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:51.105
I must tell you the Divine is the most beautiful thing,

00:20:51.305 --> 00:20:53.998
because it creates all beautiful things.

00:20:54.198 --> 00:20:59.229
You see in the nature, every leaf is different from another.

00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:03.912
Such a variety. Also, if you see,

00:21:04.112 --> 00:21:09.857
all leaves are so arranged that they all get sunshine.

00:21:10.057 --> 00:21:15.026
Such a consideration, such an understanding.

00:21:15.227 --> 00:21:19.664
In the same way, when Divine works in you,

00:21:19.864 --> 00:21:24.111
you also have that capacity

00:21:24.312 --> 00:21:28.716
to share it with others, understand with others

00:21:28.916 --> 00:21:32.043
and to be part and parcel of the whole.

00:21:32.244 --> 00:21:38.118
Not just yourself, single personality.

00:21:41.347 --> 00:21:45.606
Now, one thing is there

00:21:45.807 --> 00:21:49.478
that people are now conscious of their beauty.

00:21:49.678 --> 00:21:55.678
But perhaps they don't know, how do we spoil our beauty.

00:21:55.878 --> 00:22:01.113
First, let us see, how our beauty spoils.

00:22:01.314 --> 00:22:05.549
It is spoiled sometimes,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:10.832
showing lots of wrinkles on the face.

00:22:11.033 --> 00:22:16.145
Now, I am 77 years of age. I'll be 78 very soon.

00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:20.578
And I am grand-grandmother. I don't have wrinkles.

00:22:20.778 --> 00:22:24.138
Nor my daughters have.

00:22:24.338 --> 00:22:27.840
The reason is this,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:35.298
that normally human beings specially ladies, react very much,

00:22:35.498 --> 00:22:37.774
react to everything.

00:22:37.974 --> 00:22:41.898
Whatever happens in their life, they react,

00:22:42.098 --> 00:22:45.640
whatever happens in others lives they react,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:54.222
whatever is happening on the other planes, they react.

00:22:54.422 --> 00:22:57.532
By reacting, you do not get to anything.

00:22:57.732 --> 00:23:01.954
You do not achieve anything.

00:23:02.155 --> 00:23:04.142
So, the first thing,

00:23:04.343 --> 00:23:08.823
I would say that when it happens, you don't react.

00:23:09.023 --> 00:23:11.555
You just watch, you become a witness.

00:23:11.755 --> 00:23:17.258
You become the witness of the whole thing.

00:23:17.458 --> 00:23:22.178
And when these things happen, then the creativity

00:23:22.378 --> 00:23:25.298
starts coming from somewhere unknown,

00:23:25.498 --> 00:23:29.575
and you are amazed how you can create things

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:32.938
without reading any book, without taking any help,

00:23:33.138 --> 00:23:36.893
and suddenly you become very, very creative.

00:23:37.093 --> 00:23:42.978
I've seen in Sahaja yoga, how people have achieved

00:23:43.178 --> 00:23:47.076
great heights in creativity,

00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:49.978
in sports, in everything

00:23:50.178 --> 00:23:54.889
because they get this energy, divine energy within them.

00:23:55.089 --> 00:23:58.917
So, they also understand,

00:23:59.117 --> 00:24:05.452
that they have to be more patient,

00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:13.100
more loving, more caring towards themselves and towards others also.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.658
Once that happens -

00:24:15.858 --> 00:24:19.008
I've seen this one is so beautifully done -

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:23.378
is that you start caring for people.

00:24:23.578 --> 00:24:28.370
You start caring for your customers, understanding them,

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:33.978
plus your creativity.
You do not borrow ideas from others,

00:24:34.178 --> 00:24:37.298
you don't learn by your own mad thinking,

00:24:37.498 --> 00:24:42.858
but you actually become creative
under the influence of the Divine.

00:24:43.058 --> 00:24:48.663
And when the Divine starts working, it's perfect.

00:24:48.863 --> 00:24:51.029
Perfection.

00:24:51.229 --> 00:24:53.258
There's no competition.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:57.999
You create not out of competition, but just to create.

00:24:58.199 --> 00:25:01.638
Freely. There's no compulsion.

00:25:01.838 --> 00:25:05.716
And when you start creating, you are amazed at yourself,

00:25:05.917 --> 00:25:11.565
how can you create all these things with whatever knowledge

00:25:11.766 --> 00:25:14.939
you have, whatever experience you have?

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.402
All these things happen.

00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:21.947
I'm happy it has happened in the case of Mr. Emro

00:25:22.147 --> 00:25:28.497
and that he has taken that he should pass this to you people.

00:25:28.697 --> 00:25:35.938
Now in modern times,
fashion has become very popular.

00:25:36.138 --> 00:25:42.825
So it's alright. But the fashion that you (use)

00:25:43.025 --> 00:25:50.676
how far it is helpful to you in your
health, that you should see to it.

00:25:50.876 --> 00:25:53.971
Now if I reveal certain things, you should not be shocked

00:25:54.172 --> 00:25:57.035
and should not be unhappy about.

00:25:57.241 --> 00:26:06.487
All these centers are expressed
in our different parts of the body.

00:26:06.687 --> 00:26:10.043
For example, this green one that you see.

00:26:10.243 --> 00:26:17.254
It's here in the Nabhi, is expressed on these two knees.

00:26:17.455 --> 00:26:21.738
Very important - two knees are very important.

00:26:21.938 --> 00:26:26.725
So, if you want to keep your knees
in perfect health, I would say

00:26:26.926 --> 00:26:32.378
one should not expose the knees. If you
expose the knees, everybody sees that.

00:26:32.578 --> 00:26:35.222
And there are lots of negative forces around.

00:26:35.422 --> 00:26:38.912
What's the use of exposing the knee? I don't understand.

00:26:39.112 --> 00:26:42.258
About twenty years back, nobody used to do that.

00:26:42.458 --> 00:26:47.351
But now suddenly the fashion has
started, that you expose your knees.

00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:52.516
And exposure of knees, you will end up with very bad knees,

00:26:52.716 --> 00:26:58.258
you won't be able to even walk. At My age -  you may not reach also.

00:26:58.458 --> 00:27:01.012
So it has to be covered.

00:27:01.212 --> 00:27:04.412
Now if you wear a covered knee thing in England,

00:27:04.612 --> 00:27:12.058
or anywhere in the west,
they'll ask you, "Are you Turkish?"

00:27:12.258 --> 00:27:16.938
Now, because in Turkey they know this.
Turkish people are still traditional -

00:27:17.138 --> 00:27:20.058
they know, they will not expose their knees.

00:27:20.258 --> 00:27:24.185
And exposure of knees is very dangerous.

00:27:24.385 --> 00:27:29.407
This is a very, very important chakra - we call as a Nabhi chakra.

00:27:29.607 --> 00:27:34.538
It is related to our

00:27:34.738 --> 00:27:39.258
Lakshmi tatwa also - Lakshmi means the goddess of money.

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:45.498
It is expressed in so many ways
within us: our digestion, everything.

00:27:45.698 --> 00:27:49.338
Apart from that, the main thing is,

00:27:49.538 --> 00:27:56.010
it gives a very different expression to your body.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.698
Supposing there's somebody who is very greedy -

00:27:59.898 --> 00:28:03.286
you can make out from the face.

00:28:03.486 --> 00:28:08.128
Somebody who is very jealous - you can make out, from the face.

00:28:08.328 --> 00:28:14.014
Somebody who is very cunning - you can make out from the face.

00:28:14.214 --> 00:28:19.487
In the same way, when you have this first center

00:28:19.687 --> 00:28:22.498
it's very, very important,

00:28:22.698 --> 00:28:27.871
which is too much, maybe, to tell you, but it's very important.

00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:34.071
This is the center of your innocence.

00:28:35.239 --> 00:28:41.713
This innocence is there, always. It
cannot be destroyed, it is indestructible.

00:28:41.913 --> 00:28:45.458
Whatever you may do, whatever wrong you may commit,

00:28:45.658 --> 00:28:48.831
whatever immoral thing you may do, this center is there

00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:51.224
and innocence is there.

00:28:51.425 --> 00:28:54.113
It might be covered with some clouds - it's different -

00:28:54.313 --> 00:28:58.106
but nobody can destroy this center.

00:28:58.306 --> 00:29:03.438
Now the face that is innocent, is always
very beautiful. You see the children,

00:29:03.639 --> 00:29:07.178
what love you have for children, because they have innocent faces.

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:09.991
This center has to be looked after.

00:29:10.191 --> 00:29:17.443
And this center gets distorted and
spoiled

00:29:17.643 --> 00:29:21.458
while, not that you become cunning and all that,

00:29:21.658 --> 00:29:26.298
but it gets spoilt when you don't respect your chastity.

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:29.926
That's a very important thing. You may do whatever fashion you like,

00:29:30.126 --> 00:29:34.418
but your chastity is very important - that's your power.

00:29:34.618 --> 00:29:39.715
If you respect your chastity, nobody can destroy you.

00:29:39.915 --> 00:29:43.467
That's the greatest boon human beings have,

00:29:43.668 --> 00:29:47.661
whether they are men or women. Chastity is very important

00:29:47.862 --> 00:29:49.898
and this center will start showing its results.

00:29:54.164 --> 00:30:00.108
With innocence, your face becomes very innocent

00:30:00.308 --> 00:30:06.298
and loving, lovable, like that of children.

00:30:06.498 --> 00:30:12.258
Cunningness, you can see on the face. At least, I can see.

00:30:12.458 --> 00:30:17.527
You can understand persons being exploiting you,

00:30:17.727 --> 00:30:20.130
making use of you.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:27.765
But if this center is alright,
then you're so powerful.

00:30:27.965 --> 00:30:33.887
You're so powerful, that nobody can destroy your innocence.

00:30:34.087 --> 00:30:38.743
And that is to be respected very much for the beauty, I think.

00:30:38.944 --> 00:30:43.898
I have seen women who are very
beautiful, have innocence in them.

00:30:44.098 --> 00:30:47.158
They may not be sexually attractive and all that,

00:30:47.358 --> 00:30:50.794
but the face is so innocent

00:30:50.995 --> 00:30:54.140
so innocent, lovable.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.387
Whatever may be your age, is not
the point, but you respect yourself.

00:30:58.587 --> 00:31:04.154
First of all, if you don't respect
yourself, who is going to respect you?

00:31:04.354 --> 00:31:07.995
Then another thing is that, the second chakra is

00:31:08.195 --> 00:31:12.138
above that, the green one, is this red chakra.

00:31:12.338 --> 00:31:17.488
This is for your heart. We call it the center heart.

00:31:17.688 --> 00:31:21.058
When you are insecure, then this thing catches.

00:31:21.258 --> 00:31:27.338
And this chakra has got a quality
by which it produces angels.

00:31:27.538 --> 00:31:31.123
You can call them as anything - they call them antibodies.

00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:35.418
These angels are created for your protection.

00:31:35.618 --> 00:31:39.128
For everything. If you have any disease they'll fight it,

00:31:39.328 --> 00:31:42.098
if you have any problems, they will fight it.

00:31:42.298 --> 00:31:44.258
If you have any fear -

00:31:44.458 --> 00:31:48.269
say suddenly you see a dog, tiger or something -

00:31:48.469 --> 00:31:51.498
this center will start pulsating like that.

00:31:51.698 --> 00:31:55.058
And this pulsation creates

00:31:55.258 --> 00:31:59.658
a kind of a emotion among these people whom I call angels.

00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:06.578
And these angels know that there's
a danger and they try to protect you.

00:32:06.778 --> 00:32:13.058
So this center is very important.
You must have security.

00:32:13.258 --> 00:32:20.322
Your sense of security is disturbed,
when this center goes into jeopardy.

00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:21.893
It is...

00:32:22.093 --> 00:32:25.287
Modern times is full of insecurities.

00:32:25.487 --> 00:32:29.118
Especially for ladies - full of insecurities.

00:32:29.318 --> 00:32:34.568
They're always feeling, "God knows what's going to happen to me,

00:32:34.768 --> 00:32:37.618
what is going to be against me".

00:32:37.818 --> 00:32:41.537
All this is on this center, a little bit.

00:32:41.737 --> 00:32:44.886
This is the Mother's center.

00:32:45.086 --> 00:32:50.778
And if you understood the meaning of your mother's heart,

00:32:50.978 --> 00:32:55.626
or your heart as a mother, you have understood that part,

00:32:55.827 --> 00:32:59.898
then this center settles down,
you feel secured.

00:33:00.058 --> 00:33:04.239
You have to be absolutely secure within yourself.

00:33:04.439 --> 00:33:08.423
This is a very important point. These days I find

00:33:08.624 --> 00:33:12.442
women are having so many breast cancers and all that.

00:33:12.642 --> 00:33:15.734
That is also due to this center. Why?

00:33:15.935 --> 00:33:23.445
Because if the husband is very dominating, and very exacting,

00:33:23.646 --> 00:33:26.285
then women develop this.

00:33:26.485 --> 00:33:29.972
And in America, you'll be amazed, in a place where women are

00:33:30.172 --> 00:33:35.224
so well placed, so many women have this trouble.

00:33:35.424 --> 00:33:38.092
I couldn't explain. I couldn't understand.

00:33:38.292 --> 00:33:41.708
While in Indian women don't have.

00:33:41.908 --> 00:33:52.397
Surprisingly. Because in India, the
children are the power of the mother.

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:56.919
Her power is not with anything else but with her children.

00:33:57.119 --> 00:34:01.538
And she'll see to it that her children get proper education,

00:34:01.738 --> 00:34:04.178
they are brought up well for anything,

00:34:04.378 --> 00:34:08.072
that she has to sell her ornaments and sell everything,

00:34:08.272 --> 00:34:12.193
but she would see that they are well educated.

00:34:12.393 --> 00:34:16.978
And she will look after them first than
anything else, when she's a mother.

00:34:17.178 --> 00:34:22.359
That doesn't mean that you give up your
profession, doesn't mean that you don't go out,

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:26.698
but you have to put full attention to your children - very important.

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:30.818
I show the result of that is this today:

00:34:31.018 --> 00:34:37.292
that all the software people are coming from India. Why?

00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:41.020
Why not from England and why not from other countries,

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.778
who are supposed to be so developed?

00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:49.537
When I came here, I was surprised so many of my disciples,

00:34:49.737 --> 00:34:53.858
they were not worried about their studies.

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:57.544
They said: "We want to be big, we want to become garbage cleaners.".

00:34:57.744 --> 00:34:59.398
I said "Why?"

00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:03.341
"Because you can get a lot of money
in that way. But what a student?

00:35:03.542 --> 00:35:06.080
Even if you are a graduate you don't get much money."

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.031
I said, "You don't understand your dignity,

00:35:10.231 --> 00:35:14.058
you don't understand you have to progress
in your thinking and understanding."

00:35:14.258 --> 00:35:17.698
They said, "No, we want to do something where we can get money.

00:35:17.898 --> 00:35:21.903
We can take to anything that can give us money." "It will give you money",

00:35:22.104 --> 00:35:26.178
I said, "but it will not give you
education and concentration."

00:35:26.378 --> 00:35:30.359
That is the main point you should have, is your concentration.

00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:33.458
And this concentration if it doesn't come,

00:35:33.658 --> 00:35:37.060
then you cannot work out anything.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.498
Thank God, I told them, "You better take to some education."

00:35:40.698 --> 00:35:43.538
They all got admissions into good colleges, schools.

00:35:43.738 --> 00:35:46.937
Now they're doing very well.

00:35:47.137 --> 00:35:50.245
It's alright. You may earn later. Money is not everything.

00:35:50.445 --> 00:35:54.548
You may earn little less but at least you have the education.

00:35:54.748 --> 00:35:58.982
Now there's such a dearth of education
in America, among you people.

00:35:59.182 --> 00:36:03.577
First of all, the education is extremely, extremely expensive

00:36:03.777 --> 00:36:07.489
and those schools which are available otherwise are of no good.

00:36:07.689 --> 00:36:11.035
So, what we find we can have better carpenters,

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:16.648
we can have better windows,
but no education.

00:36:16.848 --> 00:36:21.572
So, people are pouring from India for software-ing

00:36:21.772 --> 00:36:25.120
Because the concentration is gone.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:30.576
So this concentration power comes from the mother, to the children,

00:36:30.776 --> 00:36:34.346
and they have very concentrated mind.

00:36:34.546 --> 00:36:42.928
It's very important to have that
concentration and the faith, as a mother.

00:36:43.128 --> 00:36:45.458
So many people, why do they get

00:36:45.658 --> 00:36:50.350
ladies, specially get this breast cancer - I can't understand.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:54.126
Because they are insecure. A husband cannot make you insecure,

00:36:54.326 --> 00:36:59.376
if you have children and if your children are to your support.

00:36:59.561 --> 00:37:03.769
If you are even alone, you should have faith in your mother.

00:37:03.969 --> 00:37:09.338
Such mothers if there are, who will look
after you, who will always support you,

00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:14.618
will give you that security which is
very important for these antibodies.

00:37:14.818 --> 00:37:18.318
Even the cancer and all these diseases are caused by

00:37:18.519 --> 00:37:22.178
the lack of antibodies within us.

00:37:22.378 --> 00:37:26.607
So these antibodies are like little, little, we can call angels

00:37:26.807 --> 00:37:29.978
which look after you, which worry about you.

00:37:30.178 --> 00:37:35.029
This is the treasure you have within
yourself which should not be exploited.

00:37:35.229 --> 00:37:39.219
Your security should not be allowed to challenge anyone.

00:37:39.419 --> 00:37:44.403
This is, that's why I said, it's a
very, very important center is this one,

00:37:44.603 --> 00:37:50.099
what you call, it's the heart chakra.

00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:54.128
Now outside without Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:54.328 --> 00:38:01.138
I don't know how one can achieve the stability of the heart.

00:38:01.338 --> 00:38:07.174
Heart becomes weak because people lose tempers.

00:38:07.374 --> 00:38:12.698
Those who are very hot tempered people,
they have problems on their heart.

00:38:12.898 --> 00:38:17.174
And I have seen people they get a heart attack

00:38:17.374 --> 00:38:19.778
and get it all kinds of heart problems

00:38:19.978 --> 00:38:26.618
because of this chakra in danger - heart chakra.

00:38:26.818 --> 00:38:31.578
So, insecurity on one side, and heart attacks on another side.

00:38:31.778 --> 00:38:34.938
To get angry is very wrong.

00:38:35.138 --> 00:38:40.178
To get angry is absolutely ruining yourself, it's self destructive.

00:38:40.378 --> 00:38:44.303
But by telling it will not happen. You have to have Realization,

00:38:44.504 --> 00:38:50.451
you must have Self Realization, by which you become absolutely peaceful,

00:38:50.652 --> 00:38:53.217
absolutely peaceful.

00:38:53.417 --> 00:38:57.276
Then the last chakra is this one, Vidshuddhi chakra is at the last (???).

00:38:57.476 --> 00:39:01.018
This chakra, Vishuddhi, is here -

00:39:01.218 --> 00:39:05.336
it's important. This gets spoiled by many things.

00:39:05.536 --> 00:39:12.395
Supposing you use abusive words, if
you are aggressive with your tongue.

00:39:12.595 --> 00:39:16.006
Like in America, they use very abusive words, I was surprised.

00:39:16.206 --> 00:39:21.188
All the time they're using stupid
words which I don't even understand.

00:39:21.388 --> 00:39:27.972
All that is causing this trouble.
And this can go up to any limit.

00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:32.559
Because it controls 16 of your...

00:39:32.759 --> 00:39:37.551
16 of your, I should say, organs, right?

00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:41.994
It controls your eyes, it controls your nose, it controls your tongue,

00:39:42.194 --> 00:39:46.257
it controls your teeth, it controls your ears,

00:39:46.457 --> 00:39:52.304
everything are controlled, 16 things
are controlled by this Vishuddhi chakra.

00:39:52.504 --> 00:39:58.152
And on the both sides we have the most important, very great chakras,

00:39:58.353 --> 00:40:04.418
which we can call, it says they rule
ourselves and the whole world.

00:40:04.618 --> 00:40:07.908
These are 2 chakras, on the sides.

00:40:08.108 --> 00:40:15.707
And they are,
we call them as...

00:40:15.907 --> 00:40:21.098
I don't need other Indian names, but they
are very important chakras, these two.

00:40:21.298 --> 00:40:27.778
And when you expose them, then you have problems with these.

00:40:27.978 --> 00:40:31.624
So they should not be exposed. You can have small sleeves.

00:40:31.825 --> 00:40:33.823
But never expose them.

00:40:34.023 --> 00:40:37.144
Then you can get any kind of problem,

00:40:37.344 --> 00:40:43.293
any kind of problem,
combined with this chakra.

00:40:43.493 --> 00:40:50.004
I'm sorry, I have to warn you people.
Alright. But it's a fashion now.

00:40:50.204 --> 00:40:53.736
What is the need to expose? To please men?

00:40:53.937 --> 00:40:56.632
Why should you care?

00:40:56.833 --> 00:41:00.005
Why should you care for men so much? I can't understand.

00:41:00.206 --> 00:41:02.885
Women are the shakti, they are the power.

00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:06.986
Why should you try to please men?

00:41:07.187 --> 00:41:13.851
So why have this kind of a inferiority complex about yourself

00:41:14.052 --> 00:41:16.644
all the time trying to please men?

00:41:16.845 --> 00:41:24.302
And they are very funny, I tell you.
What has killed romance is this.

00:41:24.503 --> 00:41:31.550
See a man falls in love with say - I'm
sorry to say this - with our hair dress.

00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:34.151
There's a hair dress, a particular hair dress,

00:41:34.351 --> 00:41:38.363
so Mr. X falls in love with that hair dress.

00:41:38.564 --> 00:41:46.427
But then she goes to hairdresser, changes
her dress. It's over, romance is over.

00:41:46.627 --> 00:41:48.800
They're so superficial.

00:41:49.001 --> 00:41:53.622
They're so superficial that they can fall for your hair dress.

00:41:53.823 --> 00:41:56.325
And the women feel so disappointed

00:41:56.525 --> 00:42:02.658
the way the men treat them and
behave. So, I would suggest that

00:42:02.858 --> 00:42:07.761
it's very important that you should not try to please men.

00:42:07.961 --> 00:42:10.818
You be yourself, in your self esteem.

00:42:11.018 --> 00:42:15.498
You are women, after all, and you have special qualities.

00:42:15.698 --> 00:42:20.221
Stand in your own dignity. Stand in your own power.

00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:25.401
And in this, when it happens, women get more power than men can get.

00:42:25.601 --> 00:42:31.699
It's very surprising. And it works out so beautifully for women.

00:42:31.899 --> 00:42:34.803
And it should. Now, for example,

00:42:35.004 --> 00:42:39.738
you are you are yourself hairdresser or anything you are,

00:42:39.938 --> 00:42:46.816
you become so creative. If you are a
musician, you become very creative.

00:42:47.016 --> 00:42:49.898
If you are anything, whatever profession you are following,

00:42:50.098 --> 00:42:53.886
you become so very creative when this thing happens to you,

00:42:54.086 --> 00:42:56.778
because all your centers are cleared out.

00:42:56.978 --> 00:43:00.721
And the power of the Divine is pouring through you.

00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:05.050
This is what you should achieve, that is what you should have,

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:09.455
then nobody can dominate you.

00:43:09.655 --> 00:43:12.618
Not only that, it goes higher,

00:43:12.818 --> 00:43:16.851
this is the most important chakra, which is called,

00:43:17.051 --> 00:43:20.538
we call it Agnya chakra between the optic chiasma like this.

00:43:20.738 --> 00:43:23.538
And if it is not open, it is very, very constricted

00:43:23.738 --> 00:43:26.308
if it doesn't open then Kundalini won't pass through.

00:43:26.509 --> 00:43:30.978
Now this is the chakra of Jesus Christ where we crucified Him.

00:43:31.178 --> 00:43:36.237
Now what did he do, He first gave forgiveness

00:43:36.437 --> 00:43:40.925
to all the people who tried to torture Him, and crucified Him.

00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:45.098
So only the way you forgive people, it opens out.

00:43:45.298 --> 00:43:48.738
You have to forgive. No use to remember him.

00:43:48.938 --> 00:43:52.399
Somebody has hurt you, alright. So what?

00:43:52.599 --> 00:43:56.818
It's finished. It's not today. Whatever has happened has happened.

00:43:57.018 --> 00:44:01.335
Why worry about it? But if you
don't forgive, then all the time

00:44:01.535 --> 00:44:06.131
you'll be thinking about it and will be torturing yourself for nothing at all.

00:44:06.332 --> 00:44:09.353
Instead of that you just forgive. Forgive everything.

00:44:09.554 --> 00:44:14.551
Forgiving is a very great quality by which nobody can torture you,

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:18.378
nobody can trouble you, because
you do not pay any attention to.

00:44:18.578 --> 00:44:22.576
You don't know people are trying to trouble Me so much

00:44:22.776 --> 00:44:26.998
so much they have done to make Me, sort of hurt,

00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:31.254
or do all kinds of things. But somehow, I forgive them.

00:44:31.455 --> 00:44:34.789
And I am finished. Because once you forgive them,

00:44:34.989 --> 00:44:39.218
you don't remember what they have done
to you, and you never torture yourself.

00:44:39.418 --> 00:44:42.748
But if you don't forgive, then you torture yourself thinking,

00:44:42.949 --> 00:44:47.738
"Why did he do this? Why did she
do this?" Nothing - you just forgive.

00:44:47.938 --> 00:44:52.858
The very great present of Jesus - that you should forgive everyone.

00:44:53.058 --> 00:44:57.010
That gives you a great peace here.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:04.755
But this peace also is very important.
If you don't have peace within you,

00:45:04.955 --> 00:45:08.338
then you start becoming old very soon.

00:45:08.538 --> 00:45:13.978
I have seen many young girls having wrinkles, worried, upset,

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:18.378
tension, this that, all the time irritated.

00:45:18.578 --> 00:45:24.724
The reason is that they have not yet
forgiven those people who have troubled them.

00:45:24.924 --> 00:45:28.850
So if you can develop this witness state, as I said,

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:33.409
you are not bothered.
You just witness the whole thing,

00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:36.836
and you'll be amazed that this center will be opened,

00:45:37.036 --> 00:45:41.763
and by that you will not react. You will not react.

00:45:41.964 --> 00:45:45.578
You'll just see, "Alright.
This is so, so this is so."

00:45:45.778 --> 00:45:48.330
And the life becomes full of humor

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.662
and anything absurd you see, just smile and laugh.

00:45:51.862 --> 00:45:56.489
There's no time for you to think about these nonsensical things

00:45:56.689 --> 00:46:00.672
that people say about you, or try to harm you,

00:46:00.873 --> 00:46:05.733
or try tocreate a problem. You shouldn't worry.

00:46:05.933 --> 00:46:11.933
You shouldn't worry about that. Now they...

00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:21.414
With this happening,

00:46:21.615 --> 00:46:27.526
you don't try to think what others are thinking about you.

00:46:27.726 --> 00:46:29.858
because you know, you are one with Divine,

00:46:30.058 --> 00:46:32.658
because you get vibrations on your hands,

00:46:32.858 --> 00:46:36.138
you are assured that you are alright, so you have confidence.

00:46:36.338 --> 00:46:42.626
But you don't with this confidence,
oppress others. It is confidence with love.

00:46:42.826 --> 00:46:47.298
I call it as the intelligence which is emotional.

00:46:47.498 --> 00:46:51.623
I call it as emotional intelligence.
Many children are born with it,

00:46:51.823 --> 00:46:54.499
but they are taught something else so they do it.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.583
I'll say my own great grandson,

00:46:57.783 --> 00:47:03.221
who is born with this, so as soon as we reached America,

00:47:03.422 --> 00:47:05.778
he was with us for only six months, he was a little boy,

00:47:05.978 --> 00:47:10.498
and after one, 7-8 months we went to America,

00:47:10.698 --> 00:47:15.252
immediately he brought the remote control and gave it to my husband.

00:47:15.453 --> 00:47:18.437
Because he is always seeing the television - immediately.

00:47:18.638 --> 00:47:21.315
Then he brought newspaper and gave Me to read.

00:47:21.516 --> 00:47:25.984
And to Me he brought a flower.
So, by his emotional intelligence

00:47:26.185 --> 00:47:28.768
he knows what one likes, what one has.

00:47:28.968 --> 00:47:32.482
If you come home or somebody visits us

00:47:32.682 --> 00:47:39.355
he'll immediately bring the things to
give them to eat or to please them -

00:47:39.555 --> 00:47:43.842
all the time, these things of entertaining.

00:47:44.042 --> 00:47:50.470
He'll start dancing, and he'll start
showing you dance. Have you seen it?

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:57.284
He's so careful, that he should express his love

00:47:57.484 --> 00:48:01.542
and with animals, everyone, he's so friendly.

00:48:01.743 --> 00:48:05.072
That is emotional intelligence we should develop.

00:48:05.272 --> 00:48:12.315
And depend on it, it helps you. You will
get lots of friends, you will gets lots of

00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:17.708
I should say, not only friends, but people who will help you in your work.

00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:23.838
They'll give you a great assistance in everything.

00:48:24.038 --> 00:48:30.273
It's a very, very great capacity to be emotionally intelligent.

00:48:30.473 --> 00:48:34.758
People think if you are emotional then people take advantage of you.

00:48:34.958 --> 00:48:38.507
Let them take. What's the harm?

00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:42.504
But you do no take advantage of yourself

00:48:42.704 --> 00:48:48.292
by being cruel or by being any way harsh to others.

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:51.336
Remember those days when somebody was sweet?

00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:55.547
Remember that time, that moment when somebody was very sweet,

00:48:55.748 --> 00:48:59.778
very nice to you, very kind, very helpful. Remember!

00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:03.678
Remember all these moments, not the moments when you are insulted

00:49:03.878 --> 00:49:06.244
not the time when you have suffered,

00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:11.488
but the time when somebody has given you
love, somebody has talked to you with love,

00:49:11.688 --> 00:49:15.259
and you'll be amazed such fragrance within you

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:22.558
will start blowing. So many
people have got this Realization,

00:49:22.758 --> 00:49:26.398
and they have forgotten all nonsense of fighting and all.

00:49:26.598 --> 00:49:32.167
Now we have sometimes people,
thousands of them in India sometimes,

00:49:32.367 --> 00:49:35.889
and I was surprised, they come from different countries,

00:49:36.089 --> 00:49:41.038
and Sahaja Yoga is working in 86 countries,
and they never quarrel, they never fight.

00:49:41.238 --> 00:49:44.927
I've never heard anybody quarreling or fighting.

00:49:45.127 --> 00:49:48.079
Ha, they pull each others legs, they're very humorous.

00:49:48.279 --> 00:49:53.398
That's they do. Now the another craze we have now in -

00:49:53.598 --> 00:49:57.469
I don't know why - that we should be very, very thin,

00:49:57.669 --> 00:50:02.558
that thinness is very attractive. It's not so.

00:50:02.758 --> 00:50:05.678
See you become thin sometimes automatically

00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:11.654
if your liver is out of order, which is a
very dangerous thing, to have a bad liver.

00:50:11.855 --> 00:50:14.283
I agree, you should not be fat.

00:50:14.483 --> 00:50:17.758
Also if you become fat very much you might develop something else.

00:50:17.958 --> 00:50:20.521
But If you are naturally thin,

00:50:20.722 --> 00:50:24.707
then understand that must be liver out of order.

00:50:24.907 --> 00:50:27.222
Now this liver when it is out of order,

00:50:27.422 --> 00:50:30.393
how many problems it can give, you don't know it.

00:50:30.593 --> 00:50:33.908
First of all it can give asthma.

00:50:34.108 --> 00:50:39.813
It can give you a...

00:50:40.013 --> 00:50:45.109
if it moves on the right side, it can give you diabetes.

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:49.930
It can give you, this heat, if it moves downward here,

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:54.287
it can give you also the spleen into trouble

00:50:54.487 --> 00:50:58.473
and that can ultimately give you a cancer,

00:50:58.673 --> 00:51:01.238
blood cancer, it can give you blood cancer.

00:51:01.438 --> 00:51:05.354
Then if it goes to the uterus, also it can harm you there.

00:51:05.554 --> 00:51:09.478
If this heat from the liver goes on passing throughout

00:51:09.678 --> 00:51:13.198
and creates problems all over. Not only that,

00:51:13.398 --> 00:51:18.030
but also it can give you a massive heart attack after some time.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:23.212
If you are young and if you are drinking
too much and playing tennis and all

00:51:23.412 --> 00:51:26.158
then suddenly the heart goes off.

00:51:26.358 --> 00:51:28.678
That is how many heart attacks come.

00:51:28.878 --> 00:51:33.430
So to preserve your health within yourself, first you should know what you are,

00:51:33.631 --> 00:51:36.841
what problems you have,
why these problems are there.

00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:41.438
And then also you should know why there are problems outside.

00:51:41.638 --> 00:51:45.296
This is very simple to understand if you become divine.

00:51:45.496 --> 00:51:51.724
This divine light can give you all the understanding of everything.

00:51:51.924 --> 00:51:54.282
I don't know, I've spoken about it so many times

00:51:54.482 --> 00:51:57.533
but never relating to beauty as such.

00:51:57.734 --> 00:52:04.598
But beauty is of course,
is within, you know.

00:52:04.798 --> 00:52:09.051
It's all within, it's not without. But
that I cannot convince you like this

00:52:09.252 --> 00:52:11.282
unless until you get your Realization.

00:52:11.482 --> 00:52:14.753
There's some people who may be very beautiful outside

00:52:14.953 --> 00:52:18.784
but inside would be like snakes. This can be.

00:52:18.984 --> 00:52:23.703
So best thing is to have the beauty
within. That attracts the people.

00:52:23.903 --> 00:52:28.518
See Me, I have so many disciples, now are so many all over the world.

00:52:28.718 --> 00:52:33.782
But now what do I do to them? Nothing. I just
connect them to the Divine as through this.

00:52:33.982 --> 00:52:37.861
And there are 1000 petals inside your brain,

00:52:38.061 --> 00:52:41.908
which gets enlightened and you become one with the Divine,

00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:46.503
and the divine power starts flowing through you. You become divine.

00:52:46.704 --> 00:52:54.195
Then you know what to wear, how to behave,
everything automatic. It is spontaneous.

00:52:54.395 --> 00:52:57.878
I don't have to tell you, "Do this" or "Do that", nothing.

00:52:58.078 --> 00:53:02.239
It just works out. You are your own
master. I don't have to tell you anything.

00:53:02.439 --> 00:53:05.838
You can find out what is good for you, what is bad for you.

00:53:06.038 --> 00:53:08.398
This is not only for longevity I am saying,

00:53:08.598 --> 00:53:11.918
but I am saying for the global peace.

00:53:12.118 --> 00:53:17.844
You want to have it spread to people through your endeavors,

00:53:18.045 --> 00:53:23.306
through your different ideas and
creativity, to all the people of the world.

00:53:23.506 --> 00:53:26.239
So the problems that are created by human beings -

00:53:26.439 --> 00:53:29.758
mainly they are the problems. And they can be solved.

00:53:29.958 --> 00:53:34.040
If a human being becomes so beautiful inside,

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.078
then outside also he looks beautiful,

00:53:37.278 --> 00:53:43.718
and also he can  create a
very beautiful loving world.

00:53:43.918 --> 00:53:49.918
So, I would say you can ask Me some questions.

00:53:51.174 --> 00:53:53.357
Eric? Come here.

00:53:53.557 --> 00:53:57.846
Q: Are you happy with the [unclear] people
who'd come to the Albert Hall this year?

00:53:58.046 --> 00:54:00.879
SM: Eric, you come here. It's all right.

00:54:01.079 --> 00:54:04.863
SY - Shri Mataji, were you happy with the
people who came to the Albert Hall this year?

00:54:05.063 --> 00:54:11.462
SM: Of course, why not? I was
very, very happy. Was very happy.

00:54:11.662 --> 00:54:16.177
I'm always happy otherwise.

00:54:16.377 --> 00:54:19.078
Whether they come or don't come makes no difference to Me.

00:54:19.278 --> 00:54:24.428
Q: How do you realize? How do you, how do you realize this?

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:27.972
SM: I was born like this.

00:54:28.172 --> 00:54:30.123
You see, how do you realize that you are a human being?

00:54:30.323 --> 00:54:34.078
Q: No that you, you are accepting...

00:54:34.278 --> 00:54:39.278
How do you realize that you are accepting
the change, the transition within yourself?

00:54:39.478 --> 00:54:41.478
How do you know that it's happening to you?

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:45.678
SY: Is "you", you or Shri Mataji?
Q: How does one realize?

00:54:45.878 --> 00:54:48.212
SY: How do we know when we're self realized?

00:54:48.412 --> 00:54:51.278
SM: Ah, that's a good question.

00:54:51.478 --> 00:54:57.426
That you know when you have in your
hands a cool or a hot breeze coming out.

00:54:57.626 --> 00:55:01.598
Hot breeze is there because if you
have not forgiven, there won't be any.

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:03.838
But if you put your hands like this,

00:55:04.038 --> 00:55:09.838
you should get cool breeze blowing
into you. What is this cool breeze?

00:55:10.038 --> 00:55:13.189
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. That you can feel.

00:55:13.389 --> 00:55:15.912
And also it comes out of your fontanel bone area.

00:55:16.113 --> 00:55:19.841
Yours it is, not mine, yours, and you can feel it.

00:55:20.042 --> 00:55:22.045
This is the first sign.

00:55:22.246 --> 00:55:26.518
Then you start seeing the miracles you can do with your hand.

00:55:26.718 --> 00:55:32.050
For hair dress also I should say,
that if there is one realized lady,

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.528
she will exactly know how to make the hair -

00:55:35.728 --> 00:55:39.123
because you become extremely creative.

00:55:39.323 --> 00:55:41.438
And not that you stick to one style,

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:47.525
or you copy somebody, but you have your own style.

00:55:47.725 --> 00:55:53.725
In everything you have your own style.

00:56:03.709 --> 00:56:05.656
SY: The only way is to experience it, then you know,

00:56:05.857 --> 00:56:08.398
so you may stay and ask Her to show you in a while.

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.838
Then you can feel it.

00:56:11.038 --> 00:56:13.438
The best way is to feel it yourself Shri Mataji,

00:56:13.638 --> 00:56:16.158
then you don't have to describe it, you just know it.

00:56:16.358 --> 00:56:22.998
SM: Self esteem and it's not overpowering, it's within yourself.

00:56:23.198 --> 00:56:27.518
Such peace and such joy - within yourself. It's not overpowering.

00:56:27.718 --> 00:56:30.519
On the contrary, it is so much spreading, so much

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:40.542
capturing other people, on a very higher level.

00:56:40.742 --> 00:56:46.878
Not on a mundane level, or on a very
low levels as people try to do.

00:56:47.078 --> 00:56:57.873
It's very, very divine
and extremely beautiful, I tell you.

00:56:59.687 --> 00:57:04.268
Ask the question!

00:57:04.468 --> 00:57:08.389
Have I answered all of your questions?
M: To my questions.

00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:11.164
Q: What he said?

00:57:11.364 --> 00:57:13.078
SY: Are there any other questions?

00:57:13.278 --> 00:57:20.135
SY: Mother, could the ladies and the people
here tonight experience Self Realization?

00:57:20.335 --> 00:57:22.522
SY: Can, can they experience it? Can You show us?

00:57:22.722 --> 00:57:27.918
Should I try? All right?
Then it's good. It's very good.

00:57:28.118 --> 00:57:31.636
And you will really become real professionals.

00:57:31.836 --> 00:57:37.420
As I know, Mr. Emro has been so kind to announce it,

00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:44.190
but there are so many who have got all
this but they are shy and they came quiet.

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:46.559
And they don't want to share it also,

00:57:46.759 --> 00:57:49.618
because they think that people think they are mad,

00:57:49.818 --> 00:57:52.158
there's something wrong with them.

00:57:52.358 --> 00:57:55.638
So it's very simple. It's very simple. You all can get it.

00:57:55.838 --> 00:57:57.718
Should be take out our shoes?

00:57:57.918 --> 00:58:02.393
SY: It's best to take for meditation
and to feel those energies inside.

00:58:02.594 --> 00:58:04.844
It's best to take the shoes off so that you can

00:58:05.044 --> 00:58:08.518
get a good grounding on the, on the earth, on the floor.

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:09.758
Q: Our socks as well?

00:58:09.958 --> 00:58:12.090
SY: Whichever you feel. If you feel more relaxed,

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:13.878
take your socks [as well].

00:58:14.078 --> 00:58:16.958
SM: The socks you can have, but... it's o.k.

00:58:17.158 --> 00:58:22.758
SY: Whatever you feel.

00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:26.836
SM: I'm very happy there are so many ladies.

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:29.358
Because, you now, the women are very powerful.

00:58:29.558 --> 00:58:35.558
They are very powerful - they don't know their powers.

00:58:37.971 --> 00:58:42.625
Of course. Now put both the feet on the ground, like this,

00:58:42.825 --> 00:58:48.825
little away from each other,

00:58:49.353 --> 00:58:51.968
and just put your both hands towards Me.

00:58:52.168 --> 00:58:56.754
I must tell you, this is your right to
have it. There's no obligation, nothing.

00:58:56.954 --> 00:59:00.518
It's your right to have it and you can all get it. No problems.

00:59:00.718 --> 00:59:06.718
You can get it in no time.

00:59:20.689 --> 00:59:24.385
As I've told you, you have to forgive everyone.

00:59:24.585 --> 00:59:30.763
Forgive everything, because that was past
and finished. We have to be in the present.

00:59:30.963 --> 00:59:37.278
So, forgive everyone,
and also forgive yourself.

00:59:37.478 --> 00:59:41.283
You shouldn't feel guilty about anything,
you should not be guilty about anything.

00:59:41.483 --> 00:59:45.439
Just forgive everyone, that's very important.

00:59:45.639 --> 00:59:53.539
For you to have the experience
it's important that you forgive.

00:59:53.739 --> 00:59:57.638
If you don't forgive, then you will feel hot breeze coming in.

00:59:57.838 --> 01:00:01.558
But If you forgive yourself and others,

01:00:01.758 --> 01:00:07.808
there will be nice cool breeze blowing in your hands.

01:00:12.332 --> 01:00:14.852
Now, just put your right hand towards Me,

01:00:15.053 --> 01:00:21.677
and see with your left hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

01:00:21.878 --> 01:00:25.616
which was a soft bone in your childhood. You can bend your head.

01:00:25.817 --> 01:00:35.294
And see for yourself, if there's a
cool or a hot breeze coming through.

01:00:41.357 --> 01:00:45.753
You can see it - maybe on the sides might be,

01:00:45.953 --> 01:00:49.478
but don't put it on top of the head, but above the head.

01:00:49.678 --> 01:00:52.918
You just move your hand little bit here and there,

01:00:53.118 --> 01:00:59.118
and just put your right hand towards Me.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:05.958
If it is hot that means you have not forgiven
yourself, or you have not forgiven others.

01:01:06.158 --> 01:01:12.158
So, now put your left hand towards Me

01:01:13.454 --> 01:01:17.213
and put your right hand on top of your head.

01:01:17.413 --> 01:01:20.638
Again, just see.

01:01:20.838 --> 01:01:24.398
Do not doubt yourself. Please don't doubt, have faith in yourself.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:30.598
Now it will rise, it will rise.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.597
Once more. Put your right hand towards Me,

01:01:36.797 --> 01:01:42.797
and put your left hand towards Me and see for yourself.

01:01:50.595 --> 01:01:56.399
Bend your head and close your eyes.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.192
Please close your eyes.

01:02:04.718 --> 01:02:12.863
That's all. Now, just put your hands like this,

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:17.703
and those who have felt cool breeze or a hot breeze,

01:02:17.903 --> 01:02:22.194
on these fingertips, or on the palm,

01:02:22.394 --> 01:02:28.394
or out of the fontanel bone, raise your hands.

01:02:29.749 --> 01:02:33.998
Oh, not yet? Yes, it will work out. B: What's that?

01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:37.220
Lady: I feel cool on my head and also my hands.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.006
SM: Hand you felt, not here?
SY: Cool on the head, Shri Mataji. She feels cool.

01:02:40.206 --> 01:02:44.471
SM: Then it's alright because your this center is little bit in trouble.

01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:48.608
It will be alright. If you have felt it on
your head it's alright, we will work it out.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:51.438
What about you?
Lady: Hot.

01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:55.031
SM: What is she saying?
SY: It's hot? Is it blowing hot?

01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:56.232
Lady: The hot.
SY: It's hot.

01:02:56.432 --> 01:02:58.518
SM: In the hands? Hot.

01:02:58.718 --> 01:03:01.638
SM: Alright, so please forgive. Please forgive.

01:03:01.838 --> 01:03:06.804
You see, now see, logic is like this. Wether
you forgive, you don't forgive, what do you do?

01:03:07.004 --> 01:03:12.438
Nothing. By not forgiving
you're torturing yourself.

01:03:12.638 --> 01:03:17.531
See the point? Now, so you
please forgive, really forgive.

01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:20.598
Put your hands towards Me.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:23.621
Now cooler?
Lady: No.

01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:28.267
SM: Not yet?

01:03:28.467 --> 01:03:32.808
I'll have to work on you.

01:03:33.008 --> 01:03:36.103
I have to work for your forgiveness.

01:03:36.304 --> 01:03:42.118
Anyone there? They all have felt it?

01:03:42.379 --> 01:03:46.673
Alright. So, come along.

01:03:46.873 --> 01:03:50.848
SY: Remove the chair with you.

01:03:51.048 --> 01:03:53.118
SM: Sit.
Lady: Where should I sit? here?

01:03:53.318 --> 01:03:57.741
SM: Can you sit?
Lady: I can sit...

01:03:57.941 --> 01:04:00.986
SM: Put your right hand towards Me.
Lady: Alright.

01:04:01.186 --> 01:04:03.113
Left hand on the earth.

01:04:03.313 --> 01:04:09.313
SY: On the earth.
SM: Now forgive.

01:04:11.512 --> 01:04:14.356
Liver. You have a liver problem.

01:04:14.556 --> 01:04:17.676
Lady: I do?
SM: Little bit.

01:04:17.876 --> 01:04:20.067
You think too much.
Lady: I work too hard.

01:04:20.267 --> 01:04:22.819
SM: Are you futuristic?

01:04:23.019 --> 01:04:24.670
Are you futuristic?
Lady: What?

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:27.632
SY: Planing, planing, getting worked up a lot.

01:04:27.832 --> 01:04:30.638
Lady: No, I live, I live with lot of [unclear] who think of the past

01:04:30.838 --> 01:04:33.759
but I'm not futuristic.

01:04:33.959 --> 01:04:38.365
SY: Not futuristic.

01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:44.130
SM: Forgive, please forgive.
Lady: It's hard.

01:04:44.331 --> 01:04:48.918
SY: Say it, say that, that "I forgive everybody" - just say it.

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:51.198
Lady: I don't know if I am ready.

01:04:51.398 --> 01:04:53.318
SY: Please say it. Then you've done it. It's easy.

01:04:53.518 --> 01:04:56.878
SY: But Chris she's not ready yet. Not ready yet.

01:04:57.078 --> 01:05:01.598
SM: You are all ready. Now don't have this diffidence within you.

01:05:01.798 --> 01:05:04.062
Otherwise you would not have come here. Alright?

01:05:04.262 --> 01:05:05.863
Lady: Okay, I'll forgive...

01:05:06.063 --> 01:05:08.376
SM: You are all ready. Come along, have it.

01:05:08.576 --> 01:05:14.156
Lady: Come on,  I forgive.
SM: Forgive, good. Very good idea.

01:05:14.356 --> 01:05:17.761
It's cooler?

01:05:17.961 --> 01:05:23.838
Lady: It's still hot, it's still hot!
SM: Still hot...

01:05:24.038 --> 01:05:27.842
SY: Keep say, "I'll forgive everybody" - you'll enjoy it.

01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:31.137
SY: Say that inside, inside. SY: Yeah, inside.

01:05:31.337 --> 01:05:35.679
SM: It's still. Liver?

01:05:40.158 --> 01:05:42.398
SM: Better now?
L: It's cool, yeah, it's cooler.

01:05:42.598 --> 01:05:45.058
Not so hot, not so hot.

01:05:45.258 --> 01:05:50.678
SM: It's an experience, it's not just telling
you, it's an experience. It's the truth.

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:54.613
Now she's feeling.

01:05:54.813 --> 01:05:56.525
Better now, much better.

01:05:56.725 --> 01:05:59.316
Lady: I see, yeah, not so hot, yeah, not so hot.

01:05:59.516 --> 01:06:03.131
SM: Good.

01:06:11.707 --> 01:06:15.922
Much better. You come along.

01:06:16.122 --> 01:06:21.238
You felt it in the head. Not in the hands.

01:06:21.438 --> 01:06:24.558
Can you face that side?
Lady: This side?

01:06:24.758 --> 01:06:27.078
SY: Towards her.
L: Towards her?

01:06:27.278 --> 01:06:33.278
SY: Like that? Move back. On the Vishuddhi.

01:06:34.234 --> 01:06:37.279
SM: Does she sing or?
SY: Do you sing?

01:06:37.479 --> 01:06:41.266
L: Yeah.

01:06:41.466 --> 01:06:45.424
SM: Come back, yes, come back, please. I'll give vibrations on Vishuddhi.

01:06:51.558 --> 01:06:57.738
She may develop spondylitis? Very bad.

01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:11.193
Don't feel guilty.

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:15.447
Do you feel guilty?

01:07:18.838 --> 01:07:21.192
SM: Are you a catholic?
L: No...

01:07:21.392 --> 01:07:27.275
SM: Then you should not feel.

01:07:30.038 --> 01:07:34.424
What work do you do?
SY: What work?

01:07:34.624 --> 01:07:38.918
L: What work do I do?
SY: She runs my desk.

01:07:39.118 --> 01:07:41.958
SY: She's at his desk. SY: Receptionist.

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:46.358
SY: Reception, yes.
SM: She's at the desk.

01:07:46.558 --> 01:07:50.644
SY: Busy

01:08:07.966 --> 01:08:09.766
SM: Now, are you feeling in your hands - just see.

01:08:09.966 --> 01:08:14.111
SY: Put your hands up and tell Her.

01:08:15.629 --> 01:08:19.389
SM: Turn now.

01:08:52.038 --> 01:08:55.078
Now, feel?

01:08:55.278 --> 01:08:58.960
Little bit? Alright.

01:09:00.238 --> 01:09:04.991
May God bless you.

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:14.205
Any other questions?

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.141
Have I answered all your questions?

01:09:32.076 --> 01:09:38.113
So now, you will have to understand how to meditate. That's all.

01:09:38.314 --> 01:09:42.733
And if you understand that,
you'll grow, grow very fast.

01:09:42.933 --> 01:09:45.379
I'm sure you will grow and then you'll
be amazed

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.639
at your the way you can do.
Because you will not feel disturbed.

01:09:49.839 --> 01:09:53.998
There will be no stress, strain again. Very happy you will be.

01:09:54.198 --> 01:09:58.479
Because what's the use of getting into stress?

01:09:58.679 --> 01:10:04.679
You cannot solve it, the problem you cannot solve.

01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:09.478
You can only solve the problem by solving yourself.

01:10:09.678 --> 01:10:12.878
Because the problem is within you, not without.

01:10:13.078 --> 01:10:17.998
If you think like that, it's alright.
And you all can feel very much better.

01:10:18.198 --> 01:10:22.808
You will sleep better, and you'll enjoy life much better.

01:10:23.008 --> 01:10:25.598
So, I would like to invite you all to India also,

01:10:25.798 --> 01:10:30.598
if possible, please come. We have a very
good session there, we have the seashore

01:10:30.798 --> 01:10:37.878
and enjoy yourself. She has been to one of
the Institutions of Sahaja Yoga for Music.

01:10:38.078 --> 01:10:40.363
And see how she has picked up! I was amazed the

01:10:40.564 --> 01:10:44.698
way she was playing. It's a very great thing.

01:10:44.898 --> 01:10:48.039
Indian music is not easy, you can't learn that easy.

01:10:48.239 --> 01:10:51.158
But I was surprised, in three months,

01:10:51.358 --> 01:10:55.278
the boys were singing bhajans. I said, "How did they picked up to bhajans"...

01:10:55.478 --> 01:10:58.813
Imagine, in three, three months only.

01:10:59.014 --> 01:11:02.516
I mean, you take years together to learn.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:04.767
So many things happened in...

01:11:04.968 --> 01:11:10.758
Because they have become realized souls,
and they can pick up things very fast.

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:15.319
I was amazed, really, how they have
picked up. She has picked up tabla very...

01:11:15.519 --> 01:11:19.558
in India also you wouldn't find any woman who can play at tabla.

01:11:19.758 --> 01:11:24.854
It's really remarkable.
Remarkable things happen.

01:11:25.055 --> 01:11:30.878
And you yourself will become remarkable, yourself.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:34.478
Alright, thank you very much. Thank you, may God bless you.

01:11:34.678 --> 01:11:36.718
So you can take help from Emro,

01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:39.838
he can help you I think in giving Realization.

01:11:40.038 --> 01:11:43.198
It's a very good thing you have done - I'm really thankful to you.

01:11:43.398 --> 01:11:46.905
Because I wanted to talk to ladies first

01:11:47.106 --> 01:11:52.798
because they don't know how powerful they are.

01:11:54.619 --> 01:11:57.129
Catherine!

01:11:57.329 --> 01:12:00.534
SY: So now, if anybody wants to know more about Sahaja Yoga

01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:04.358
or Self Realization

01:12:04.558 --> 01:12:07.158
there's a lot...

01:12:07.358 --> 01:12:09.878
SY: He's now got information there, if anybody wants

01:12:10.078 --> 01:12:12.485
to know a bit more about Sahaja Yoga

01:12:12.685 --> 01:12:16.464
SM: It's really great, I must say.

01:12:16.664 --> 01:12:18.630
SY: So we should do some sessions here also.

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:23.126
SM: Also there was, one actor who
came to see Me, he had a problema,

01:12:23.326 --> 01:12:26.998
I don't know where he is lost.
SY: Pardon? The actor?

01:12:27.198 --> 01:12:32.884
SM: Some actor.
SY: The actor

01:12:33.084 --> 01:12:37.464
SM: He knows him.

01:12:37.664 --> 01:12:40.599
You should try to get some actors and actresses, you see.

01:12:40.799 --> 01:12:44.838
It will be a good idea. Because they're all suffering and

01:12:45.038 --> 01:12:49.218
actually they die very fast.

01:12:56.238 --> 01:13:01.109
SY: Thank you very much. Thank you.
