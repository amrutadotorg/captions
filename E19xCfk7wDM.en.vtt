00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.310
So one would say that why Shiva, like a birthday
of Shiva you can say or something, how can

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.320
it be, because He is eternal, He is all the
time there.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:22.850
So what demarcates today's celebration, is
the establishment of Shiva on this earth.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.630
In the material self.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:37.159
Every matter has been created with a deity
and that deity is established in that matter

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.039
as you know.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:52.539
So when it was thought by Adi Shakti that
first you must establish Shiva, without Shiva

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.140
you cannot establish anything.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.329
First He is to be established, because He
is the absolute.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.609
So you have to establish Shiva, and now what
should we do?

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.609
How to establish Him?

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:05.609
He is the God of Tamo Guna.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:22.180
He is the cold, he is the God of all that
is not active.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:35.010
So first of all this earth when it receded
from the sun which was very hot was taken

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.340
very near to the moon.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.630
The moon is the brother-in-law of Shiva.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:53.140
So it was taken so close to moon that the
whole earth got covered with ice.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.760
And it was then gradually moved towards the
sun.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:05.730
When it was moved towards the sun, gradually
then it started melting.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.630
And the point that did not melt at all was
the point where Shiva was to be established.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.920
That was -- and is still that spot, and that
spot is the Kailash.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:32.690
The ice never melts there and if you see the
whole mountain is like the face of Shiva -- the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:41.300
eyes, the nose and everything you can see
clearly getting out -- and all the year round

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:57.160
it keeps its shape as it is.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.500
That is how Shiva was created, and He was
placed in a witness state, as a spectator

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.760
of all that happens on this earth.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.900
Facing towards the Kundalini of the universe,
which they were going to place in India, so

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.620
He is facing towards the South.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:31.239
He is looking at the South with both the hands
like this, like a spectator watching the spectacle

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.540
of the Adi Kundalini.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.880
That is how Shiva was created.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:57.620
So, so we'll say that the heart of the universe
is England, still Shiva resides on top of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.000
the Sahasrara: this is the seat.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.640
Like you have got the seat of Shiva on top
of your head, but He resides in your heart,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:18.069
in the same way Shiva belongs to this place
and He looks at the whole body from that,

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:26.860
this point -- so the Feet are the South, this
(top of head) is the North, this is the East...

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:38.340
the West (right arm), and this is the East
(left arm).

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.870
That is how we can see the whole map of the
universe, of the world that is created.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.220
So now...

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.919
[You can just sit.

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.480
Don't stand up.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
Listen to My lecture.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.330
Now don't take photographs.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.230
You must listen to My lecture attentively.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:10.660
In a meditative way you must listen to Me.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.900
You must make full use of Me, isn't it?

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.030
You should be meditative.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.060
Then you can hear Me very clearly, you don't
have to bother.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.120
You have to be meditative.]

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.419
So you are facing towards the south as a witness.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:44.530
Just now somebody told me that in the south
people put their head towards the south and

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.240
put their feet towards the north, I mean,
imagine.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.419
The feet are put towards Shiva, who is in
the north.

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.130
Kailasha is in the north, isn't it?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.930
It is not in the south.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.160
So why put your feet towards the north?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.670
I mean, one must use logic.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.770
These brahmins have told you all these stories
and you are doing just the opposite that should

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.770
not be done.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.910
Sometimes I feel God save this country from
brahmins.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.770
They're everywhere now: they're our rulers,
they're everywhere, and they have no idea

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.919
what Brahma is.

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:34.770
If they are real Brahmins, I'm sure one day
the real Brahmins will be in charge of this

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.820
country.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:44.210
So now when we understand that Shiva is the
first thing that is established in the matter,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.720
then in us also first the Shiva is established.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:07:00.860
When the fetus takes his form, the throb in
the heart is the establishment of Shiva.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:08.530
That is the sign that Shiva has been established.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:25.169
In case of people who are born with bad heart
or with troubles, one has to say that Shiva

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:26.169
is not fully established.

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:33.300
Not that they are bad people, but they are
not supposed to live for long, and have to

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.430
have another heart later on maybe.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:46.259
Or that there might be some sort of a problem
in their previous life, and if they pay attention

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.190
to Shiva tattwa, their heart can be cured.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.330
So the most important organ in the body is
the heart.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.600
If the heart fails, you cannot remain in existence.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.960
So the most important thing is to look after
your Shiva principle which is the Atma.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.760
We are worried about every sort of mundane
thing.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:21.180
Worried about this, worried about that, but
we are not worried about our Spirit.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.900
Which is the biggest problems with us.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:32.950
If you worry about your Spirit, if you pay
attention to your Spirit, the whole universe

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:39.830
then vibrates with Parabrahma which is nothing
but joy.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:51.890
So without, without any attention to Spirit,
if we think we can enjoy life you cannot.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:09:02.450
You cannot enjoy your life if you pay attention
to other nonsensical things and you do not

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:09.850
pay attention to your Spirit, the complete
silence comes into us only through Spirit.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:16.490
If the Spirit is awakened within us, this
silence starts working and you feel extremely

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.649
relaxed and absolutely one with yourself.

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:30.140
There is no problem, you don't seek other
things that normally people seek -- you seek

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.700
your own company and you want to be some time
with yourself.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:43.990
Only thing that you seek after finding your
Spirit is the company of other sahaja yogis

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.270
who also have found the Spirit, so that there
is a rapport established between Spirits,

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.060
that is in the heart.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:10:00.480
And this Spirit is the universal being within
us about which I have told you that once you

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.480
become one with the Spirit, you automatically
become universally conscious.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:11.120
There are so many qualities of the Shiva,
Shiva tattwa, of the principle of Shiva that

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.740
I need not tell you, but today I will tell
you another dimension which I have not touched

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.870
so far about Shiva tattwa.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:32.080
The physical aspect of Shiva tattwa is that
such a person is a more a cold type of a person.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:44.780
In the sense that such a person is not a person
who gives hot vibrations, but who has too

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:54.990
much of heat sometimes, not in balance, overdoes
it, develops a kind of a temperament which

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.750
can be extremely cold.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:05.360
Could be low blood pressure with it, could
be diarrhea also, diarrhea also one can get

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.560
with too much of spiritual strength.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.900
And also could be on the love side because
of the left side.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:23.230
Because left side is the kapha as you call
it, is kapha is the phlegm that is more.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:31.100
Because the left side is more, such a person
is always apt to catch colds and has problems

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.380
of the colds.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:41.110
So such a person has to protect oneself from
getting into colds and things like that and

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:46.610
the methods to be employed are to be learnt
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:54.630
But to give it a balance the Spirit itself
is beyond health problems.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:12:02.400
But the left sided person who always thinks
of the Spirit also can become one-sided, when

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.450
he has to live on this earth he has to be
a balanced person.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:13.230
So he has to take to another side and that
side is the activity of the spiritual growth

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.280
within himself.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:22.650
A person who is very spiritually developed
cannot exist as a Shiva tattwa on this earth.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.100
He has to exist as a balanced personality.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:33.350
And when he starts developing that balancing
within himself, the Spirit from his heart

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.450
starts rising and goes on top of his head.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:43.149
So this is the second stage where one has
to reach.

00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:49.730
Here is the whole collectivity (touches head)
-- so when you start taking your love and

00:12:49.730 --> 00:13:01.120
affection into your central nervous system,
you can say, and put it on top of your head,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.960
that means as soon as you put it in your Virat,
when it starts spreading through your Virata

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.350
shakti, through your collective being, then
only you are a complete personality.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:23.700
Otherwise you are Shiva tattwa -- Shiva tattwa
exists whether this universe exists or not.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:30.269
It exists even when the whole universe is
existing; even, even it vanishes it all goes

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:35.329
into that magnet, into that Shiva tattwa.

00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:46.120
So a person who has spiritual hankerings must
know that to raise your Shiva above the heart

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:55.860
level, he has to raise it gradually onto a
very detached method of existing on top of

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.639
the Sahasrara.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:06.379
Where there is a complete balance, complete
balance.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:11.790
Many people I have seen in Sahaja Yoga are
extremely loving, nice, very sweet persons.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:17.490
Like in Delhi, I would say people are not
so harsh as in Bombay.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:23.290
Bombay people could be harsh, Puna people
are little harsher also.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.990
But Bombay and Puna people are deeper.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:35.279
The reason is they have balanced themselves
a little, and they have gone above their heart

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:36.970
feelings like sympathies.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:43.700
"Don't be unkind to somebody, don't say anything
harsh to somebody," can be very, very funny

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:52.529
also sometimes -- like yesterday I was sleeping
in the place where you all were sleeping.

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:59.640
Now if I was in any Bombay or Puna center,
anywhere, you can't hear any voice, anywhere,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:07.300
nothing -- like a lion, you see, like a tiger
is in a forest, nobody will hear your voice.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:14.670
If there's a tiger, you can know for miles
together there's tiger somewhere, it's so

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.670
silent.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:21.230
But if I'm in Delhi, then everybody's talking:
somebody was talking about money, this that,

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.680
the whole kind of jabbering was [on], even
the sahaja yogis from foreign had become Delhi

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680
sahaja yogis.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.110
They were talking so much I was surprised,
how did they take to this talking so much

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:37.230
there: always talking, jabber, jabber -- On
the contrary if I'm sleeping there you all

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.889
should have been in meditation, sitting down
and doing meditation.

00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:46.079
Instead of that everyone was busy with all
the possible nonsensical talks, as if they

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.740
have no other chance to talk.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:55.170
And they were all jabbering, jab jab jab,
I didn't know what to say and I just I didn't

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.410
know what to do.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.300
(Inaudible)
But this is what one has to know, that unless

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:08.540
and until you raise your sympathetic attitudes
-- like you tell somebody something, "I have

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.580
had such a problem in this business", say
example like this.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.630
I mean, what a topic, but doesn't matter.If
you start, "I had a problem with this", another

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.870
will: "Yes I too had..." you see, the sympathies.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:27.459
"I too had such a problem, these people are
so bad, that happened, he had the same problem",

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:28.480
same talk.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:35.630
They are all, you see, talking about things
which are irrelevant to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.230
Even relevant to Sahaja Yoga you should not
talk when I'm there.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.230
I have to make a humble request to all of
you -- that the way you people sometimes behave

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:51.730
is not good and is not congenial to sahaja
yogis.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.190
Even to keep your mouth open in My front is
not a good thing.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:01.670
But I don't want to tell you in such details
but it is so many things are there that you

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.870
have to learn before you raise your Shiva
tattwa from your heart.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:13.149
You are good at pleasing people, at organizing
you are excellent, you organize very well,

00:17:13.149 --> 00:17:21.669
there are no quarrels; sahaja yogis in Bombay
quarrel quite a lot and even Puna sahaja yogis

00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:22.669
are quarrelsome.

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:27.199
But I must say Puna sahaja yogis are very
deep, and Bombay sahaja yogis are very deep

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:28.199
individually, they have achieved something.

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:33.130
Now they have to go further than that, is
to go little bit in the heart again.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:39.149
You see, the second essence (?)they have to
have to feel more that way, because that way

00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:43.539
they are very, very strict with people.

00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:46.259
But you see, certain amount of strictness
is to be accepted.

00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:52.960
For example, if somebody is told: "Don't touch
Mother's feet": one feels very bad.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.669
But this is a very mundane sort of an understanding
of the Mother.

00:17:57.669 --> 00:18:03.960
If She says: "Don't touch My feet" that's
what you are supposed to do, you have to do

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.659
exactly what pleases Me, and not what will
please you.

00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:14.149
So you must change your attention from pleasing
all the public -- some people say "Those who

00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:17.119
come first time Mother, we must not say this".

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.340
You must!

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:27.799
Certain things you must say to them, otherwise
you will make Me a-prasanna: that will cause

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:28.879
problems!

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:36.129
But when you say to others, you need not go
like Puna and Bombay people in their special

00:18:36.129 --> 00:18:42.729
Marathi language, but say it in a proper Urdu
style, that people don't feel bad, but you

00:18:42.729 --> 00:18:44.159
must say it!

00:18:44.159 --> 00:18:48.809
You should not put those people on My head;
instead of that you should tell them in such

00:18:48.809 --> 00:18:51.850
a way that people are alright.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:59.549
So to go deeper into you, you must do also
individual meditation and samori.

00:18:59.549 --> 00:19:06.269
I would not say all the sahaj yogis in Delhi
are like that, but... we are very good at

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:12.299
organizing, which our Bombay sahaja yogis
and these Puna sahaja yogis must learn.

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.630
They quarrel among themselves and I really
get fed up.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.279
And they treat each other shabbily, that I
don't like.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:24.429
But individually they are alright, so they
become individualistic.

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:30.080
Some people become individualistic and some
people become publicist, public... they'll

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.370
please the public, now they are two extremes.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.409
What should a sahaja yogi do?

00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:41.970
They have to become Mother addicts.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.159
They should do what your Mother likes.

00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:48.809
Do you understand?

00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:55.910
Need not please the public or need not please
the individual, but do what your Mother will

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.330
like, that's a very simple thing which Adi
Shankaracharya told you, that just keep the

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.340
Mother pleased.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.899
But nobody makes that study.

00:20:05.899 --> 00:20:08.470
Try to make the study: "What makes Mother
pleased".

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:14.509
Then you will see, I'm very easily pleased,
you see?

00:20:14.509 --> 00:20:17.919
As a Shiva tattwa.

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:23.019
Even if you make mistakes try to pull your
ears alright (laughter).

00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:28.409
But don't go too far with it.

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:37.169
You see, the mistakes to commit is alright,
but don't take it for granted that you can

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:38.509
go on committing mistakes.

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:43.639
Because you really get a big rope, but you
will hang yourself ultimately, isn't it?

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:49.710
So be afraid of the rope also which is given
to you, it will hang you much better otherwise.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.460
So one has to understand that you should not
be addicted to public opinion or to the opinion

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.460
of your own.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.460
Both things are wrong.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.110
You must behave in such a manner that it should
please all the deities within Me, as far as

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.909
I am concerned I don't exist.

00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:13.499
I have no existence, really believe Me, I
have no existence at all, I just, is an assemblage

00:21:13.499 --> 00:21:18.809
of so many existences.

00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:25.700
Otherwise I don't exist, I don't find Myself
anywhere in this body, anywhere I don't find

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.649
Myself, anywhere in the universe!

00:21:27.649 --> 00:21:30.429
I'm nowhere, I sometimes find, 'What is all
this?

00:21:30.429 --> 00:21:33.279
Is not Mine, is all foreign to Me".

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:47.360
But still I permeate into it, enjoy it, live
with it, but I'm not in it, nowhere.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.489
If you just try to understand what pleases
your Mother, you will develop your dignity

00:21:52.489 --> 00:22:04.559
because I want you to be dignified; it will
develop your joy because I want you to be

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:12.419
joyous; it will give you more capacity to
achieve more vibrations within yourself because

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:20.769
that is what I'm giving -- whatever is good
for you if you do that, it will please Me.

00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:27.049
But what I think is good for you, you may
not think, you may have your own ideas, individualistic

00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:28.049
again.

00:22:28.049 --> 00:22:35.359
Or maybe public-wise -- like I've told you
that please don't arrange My program before

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:37.259
7 o'clock in the evening.

00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:43.080
Then you may say, 'It won't suit our public'.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.389
Doesn't matter: it doesn't suit Me, that's
the main point.

00:22:45.389 --> 00:22:50.779
Because I have certain timings when only I
can really be very good.

00:22:50.779 --> 00:22:54.149
That time I have to give to somebody else,
is fixed!

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:59.159
So you don't fix My timings according to yours.

00:22:59.159 --> 00:23:02.359
Morning time before 11 o'clock no programs
should be fixed.

00:23:02.359 --> 00:23:07.032
Early in the morning if you fix, fix at five,
I don't mind.

00:23:07.032 --> 00:23:11.669
I have certain timings which I have to use
for some other purpose!

00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:18.509
So you have to understand that whatever suits
Me should be done, because that is for your

00:23:18.509 --> 00:23:19.509
good also.

00:23:19.509 --> 00:23:23.679
Because there are most beneficial.

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:30.019
I'm just telling you My own tricks so that
you take more advantage of Me.

00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:34.669
But they insist on that the people who are
going to the office won't be able to come-

00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:37.090
that's people should not come at all!

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:43.159
If there is a picture at 7 o'clock they'll
go at that picture or not?

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:52.649
Then why should you make your Mother so cheap
that it should suit their convenience -- if

00:23:52.649 --> 00:23:59.049
there are few people it is even better for
us: we'll have better accommodation in the

00:23:59.049 --> 00:24:00.879
Kingdom of God.

00:24:00.879 --> 00:24:03.929
So don't make Me cheap!

00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:06.059
That one should understand, not to cheapen
Me, keeping the dignity of your Mother.

00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:11.690
Whatever is to be achieved, I agree, that
all the brothers and sisters must be helped,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:20.549
all the public must be helped, but we can't
get rid of the kachras otherwise if you see:

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:23.749
there are lots of things which are to be just
thrown away.

00:24:23.749 --> 00:24:27.169
So we don't, should not worry about the kachra
part.

00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:33.519
Whatever is the best we'll have, but to have
that also one should not speak harshly.

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:37.109
Again I will say not to use harsh words.

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:41.120
The way people: "Get out, get out, get out"
like that one should not talk.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.409
Change your language.

00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:51.210
You must educate yourself how to talk to people
in a soft way, in a proper way.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.999
That is very important for Sahaja Yoga, because
if you go on insulting, maybe you might insult

00:24:54.999 --> 00:24:55.999
some saint!

00:24:55.999 --> 00:24:59.080
So you should not do in that way.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:09.180
Understand it, and try to make your individual
being so capable that, when you go to the

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:19.059
public, you are able to put the right concept,
the right concept, the right conduct, the

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:24.749
right behavior, and the right knowledge.

00:25:24.749 --> 00:25:29.899
Here I do not mean right rationally, right
which is absolute.

00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:34.236
The Shiva is the absolute, He is the giver
of absolute knowledge, He knows what pleases

00:25:34.236 --> 00:25:35.236
Me.

00:25:35.236 --> 00:25:50.110
The moment something will happen that will
really displease Me, He will shut the show.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.600
He is just watching this to please Me.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:26:01.789
The moment he'll find that this is not working
out, He'll stop the whole show and will say:

00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:04.379
"Shut it, finished".

00:26:04.379 --> 00:26:11.950
So though I may say the spectator is Shiva,
but He is just the judge, and He sees those

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:12.950
things.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:18.009
So try to be all right, a nice spectacle I
try to make, to please Shiva so He continues

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:24.639
to be there, and this let [let this?] universe
be a nice place to stay in, in which you rise

00:26:24.639 --> 00:26:32.999
and attain that eternal life which is promised
to you.

00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:35.210
But one has to understand what pleases Mother.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:43.669
Some people have a habit of just looking at
Me straight all the time: not the way to be

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:44.669
done!

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:51.969
Put your eyes down, all the time just you
cannot stare at Me, it's stupid!

00:26:51.969 --> 00:26:59.039
Apart from stupidity it will not please Me,
will it please you if I start staring at you

00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:01.009
all the time?

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:05.309
I don't stare at you, I try to please you
by doing all kinds of things: why don't you

00:27:05.309 --> 00:27:07.460
learn something from Me, how I try to please
you?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:14.080
You can't do all these things of course, I
know, because somebody says: "Mother, we went

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.499
there, the horse was given to us, this, that,"
this help you cannot achieve yourself.

00:27:19.499 --> 00:27:23.679
For Me, if I have a difficulty, you can't
solve My difficulty.

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:24.960
Isn't it?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.759
But I can solve your difficulties.

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:32.629
So I can please you very easily because I
have so many methods of pleasing you.

00:27:32.629 --> 00:27:35.349
For whatever methods are there, by which one
should not positively displease, that's the

00:27:35.349 --> 00:27:37.149
only thing is.

00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:42.409
You don't do anything special, but don't do
something extraordinary just to displease.

00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:52.619
If you understand this simple thing, that
don't try to do anything that will displease

00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:53.619
to please Me.

00:27:53.619 --> 00:27:54.619
It is so simple.

00:27:54.619 --> 00:28:01.559
Don't have to do anything extra, just try
to be loving, affectionate, dignified, and

00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:05.539
I'll be very happy with all that.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:07.789
As it is I'm overjoyed, I'm very happy with
you.

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:15.210
But I have to tell you what one has to achieve,
and how one has to go above these things.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:24.649
So it is necessary now for Delhi people to
rise from the heart to the Sahasrara.

00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:36.369
And it is necessary for Bombay and Puna people
to go from heart... to go from the Sahasrara

00:28:36.369 --> 00:28:38.929
to the heart.

00:28:38.929 --> 00:28:42.179
I would say Rahuri people are in between.

00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:44.929
Rahuri people are in between.

00:28:44.929 --> 00:28:47.850
They are very good organizers, and they don't
create problems for Me as far as individuals

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.850
are concerned.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:58.089
So I think Rahuri is a place, perhaps maybe
it is my Mecca, that it is so good whatever

00:28:58.089 --> 00:28:59.089
it is.

00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:00.720
But we all can be like that.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:12.460
We all can change and inform each other and
improve and educate ourselves.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:18.999
All this education can come to us, if we really
love ourselves, and care for our evolution.

00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:23.739
We don't have to bother about it much, if
we really care for.

00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:27.679
Gradually all these things will work out and
the balance can be established.

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:35.320
Those people who talk too much should not
talk so much.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.599
What I feel that when you talk too much when
you'll stop you just stop.

00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:50.200
In between: when it is necessary you must
talk, when it is not necessary you should

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.479
not talk.

00:29:51.479 --> 00:29:55.239
So that kind of personality gradually you
can develop with Sahaja Yoga, that you will

00:29:55.239 --> 00:30:00.279
develop that wisdom how far to go, how far
not to go.

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:03.179
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

00:30:03.179 --> 00:30:09.179
He doesn't do anything, He is just sitting
down there and watching the whole joke.

00:30:09.179 --> 00:30:20.619
He doesn't do anything, but He's the one who
has to watch: if He doesn't watch, then the

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:22.619
whole show is over.

00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:28.309
If you understand that in not doing anything,
how much He's doing.

00:30:28.309 --> 00:30:33.299
See the contrast: He's doing nothing as such.

00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:37.580
But He's making everybody dance, to please
Him.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:44.450
In the same way in one shot you have both
the natures, as sahaja yogis you can achieve

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:55.830
that kind of a balanced personality.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.989
It is for your good, for your evolution, for
your development.

00:30:57.989 --> 00:31:03.989
So today all of you have a great chance of
evolving individually within yourself with

00:31:03.989 --> 00:31:13.630
Shiva tattwa, which ultimately permeates into
the whole.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:18.440
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet,
I don't know if you people have understood:

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:28.159
(Hindi) The compassion of my heart I will
vibrate, I will bring it out; the compassion

00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:38.309
of my heart I will vibrate, I'll bring it
out; (Hindi) and put it into the five elements.

00:31:38.309 --> 00:31:42.309
See Kabira, do you follow him how great he
is?

00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:47.350
People talk of Kabirdas, see, he says that
take it out of the heart and put it into all

00:31:47.350 --> 00:32:06.359
the five elements.

00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:19.979
This 

00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:26.559
is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:39.119
If you understand that, then you don't have
to understand anything else.

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:46.200
You have got it in your heart, become the
capitalist in your heart, and become a communist

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200
outside.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:33:07.649
If you can achieve this balance properly,
you have done it, and we can do it, we all

00:33:07.649 --> 00:33:42.440
of us put together we will do it, we can achieve
it and we can show to 

00:33:42.440 --> 00:34:10.460
the world that everyone can achieve it.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:24.200
All ordinary human beings so-called will can
become extraordinary.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:35:06.940
So today we have to decide about ourselves
that we are going to do it, we are going to

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:52.430
be educated about it, in a spiritual way,
in a Sahaja way.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:36:47.340
And every moment if you watch yourself you
can know.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:37:02.619
And 

00:37:02.619 --> 00:37:34.730
not to explain yourself, and to say "Oh, this
happened to me, that happened to me": that's

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.420
not the point.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.250
Many people tell Me like that, that's absurd.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:38:33.140
You challenge yourself: how can it happen
to you?

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:38.380
Why don't you do it?

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.240
You should do it.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.869
Why can't you do it?

00:38:42.869 --> 00:39:20.470
Like that you take yourself to task and 
you can work it out, I'm sure, because you've

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:30.329
got 
the power to do it.

00:39:30.329 --> 00:39:51.559
I bless you all for your spiritual development
and for your collectivity.

00:39:51.559 --> 00:40:10.799
Both things must be looked after.

00:40:10.799 --> 00:40:36.099
If you have spiritual development and no collectivity,
it is useless.

00:40:36.099 --> 00:40:56.720
If you 

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:03.460
have collectivity and spiritual development
none, it is useless.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.789
Combine it properly.

00:41:05.789 --> 00:41:34.559
So we have to take Shiva 

00:41:34.559 --> 00:41:41.470
and establish Him into the Virat.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:54.109
This is 

00:41:54.109 --> 00:42:17.170
what we have to do, and if you understand
this point, your relationships with others

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:50.019
also will 
be good, permanent, of 

00:42:50.019 --> 00:43:12.170
a 

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:21.940
very substantial nature.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:45:06.299
And the quality of sahaja yogis' life will
be something very, very great.

00:45:06.299 --> 02:22:00.970
May God bless you all.
