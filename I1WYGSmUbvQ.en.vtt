Shri Saraswati Puja, Vancouver (Canada)
August 11th, 1990

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.925
When they asked Me

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.304
what puja we should have in Vancouver,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.997
I had heard about this ashram that
it is placed

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:51.517
in very beautiful surroundings of nature

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:04.246
and, as nature is being created by the
power of Saraswati,

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:11.999
I thought best would be to have the Puja
of Saraswati here.

00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:16.526
Another thing is that when people live
in nature,

00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:26.665
they become extremely creative, their
delicate feelings are preserved

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:36.147
and they are never in a rush; or they are
not what we can call too much modernized,

00:01:36.172 --> 00:01:40.590
because nature soothes them down.

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:47.911
So also the creativity of Saraswati adds
to artist,

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:56.227
and I knew that there must have been
many artist in this country created

00:01:56.252 --> 00:01:59.044
since long.

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:13.844
The Canada as such I feel is the Hamsa
Chakra of the Vishuddhi,

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:28.142
but the power of Saraswati becomes
Mahasaraswati

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:38.122
when it is manifested by the Mahabrahmadeva
which is called as Hiranyagarbha.

00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:43.006
For that She has to cross through
the Hamsa.

00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:49.721
She crosses through Hamsa and becomes
the Vishnumaya Shakti.

00:02:52.701 --> 00:03:01.277
I mean She is the Vishnumaya Shakti.
So Saraswati becomes the Vishnumaya.

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:05.209
She crosses at two points – one at Hamsa

00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:14.990
and another at Vishuddhi – so She is
the Sister of Shri Krishna.

00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:21.704
So Saraswati was born as the Sister
of Shri Krishna,

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:30.210
and when Krishna’s mama, his name was,
his uncle was Kamsa,

00:03:30.235 --> 00:03:40.154
he came to kill Her, She just rose
into the sky and became the lightning,

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:51.885
and She declared the coming of Shri
Krishna, that He is already there existing.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.090
So the relationship between Shri Krishna

00:03:56.115 --> 00:04:02.212
and Vishnumaya is that of a brother
and a sister,

00:04:02.237 --> 00:04:09.571
and surprisingly the other day we
celebrated the Rakhi Bandhan,

00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:15.990
Raksha Bandhan, which is the same thing
as the brothers/sisters relationship.

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:21.284
So now here we are celebrating actually
the Deity which is the Sister

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:27.929
of Shri Krishna. Later on She was born
as Draupadi,

00:04:27.954 --> 00:04:31.720
and that’s why Shri Krishna went to save
Her chastity,

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:36.165
because is the brother only who is
concerned about the chastity

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.279
and the name of the sister.

00:04:40.304 --> 00:04:48.168
So this is what yesterday happened
that is the Saraswati Puja,

00:04:48.193 --> 00:04:57.403
so Vishnumaya, Herself, yesterday
sixteen times thundered here;

00:04:57.428 --> 00:05:02.379
and I didn’t tell anybody what was
happening, but I knew She would do that.

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:07.946
And apart from that, She has also
threatened Washington.

00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:12.808
That’s a good thing because Washington
has to be awakened.

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:17.434
Now these are very, very subtle things
and very subtle relations,

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:23.820
and only I can tell these things because
I know them,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.615
that these relations exist. So I was not
surprised that She was there,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.967
but exactly sixteen hundred times
She passed it, this part of Vancouver,

00:05:37.992 --> 00:05:47.376
is to show that the time has come for you
to understand

00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:51.318
that Sahaja Yoga is so important,

00:05:51.343 --> 00:05:57.239
and if we do not assert ourselves fully
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:57.264 --> 00:06:02.542
Vishnumaya is going to take another
form which may burn all your forest,

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:07.649
may burn everything. Now you must know
that lightning represents

00:06:07.674 --> 00:06:13.429
all the five elements in it.

00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:19.669
It has sound, it has light, it is
in the ether, it acts in the ether.

00:06:19.694 --> 00:06:26.669
Also it has got what you called
the water in it,

00:06:26.694 --> 00:06:33.759
and when the water goes into friction,
which is the Mother Earth,

00:06:33.784 --> 00:06:37.730
so all these things act through Her.

00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:41.869
So this Vishnumaya yesterday showed us that

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:50.331
“I’m here now. Please worship Me.” And
so far we have never worshiped Saraswati,

00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:54.716
and Brahmadeva is not worshiped anywhere
because He created this world,

00:06:54.741 --> 00:07:02.080
He created all these woods and all these
things and they created

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:12.685
all the seas and all the lands,
all the stars, universes after universes.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.734
But we are not to worship like we worship
this tree or that tree.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.543
We are not to worship anything of that
kind, only thing

00:07:21.543 --> 00:07:27.154
whatever is created by Mother Earth like
Swayambus, that’s only we worship.

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:31.648
And that, too, we worship now in a way
that is in an abstract way,

00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:37.031
because wherever they have appeared
people are doing commercial religion,

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:42.132
so we don’t go to these places also
as sahaja yogis.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.902
So you can understand why all these
things happened

00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:48.402
unexpectedly yesterday after My coming,

00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:52.865
that there was such a light of lightning
which never happened before

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:57.064
and people were surprised. So is
the Krishna’s Sister

00:07:57.089 --> 00:08:07.232
who is a much more dynamic and

00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:16.732
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi]

00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:26.913
much more fiery personality – much,
much more fiery personality.

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:39.189
Shri Krishna’s essence is that He is
sweetness, is Madhuria is His capacity

00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:45.058
and Radha is the Allahda Dayini Shakti,
means the One which gives you

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:50.587
that joy which creates

00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:55.437
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi],

00:08:55.462 --> 00:09:01.757
raises your hair with joy – so,
but in Sanskrit it is pulakit,

00:09:01.782 --> 00:09:10.084
pulakita is the word. So this beauty
of Shri Krishna which is sweetness,

00:09:10.109 --> 00:09:23.902
the leela, creating beautiful feelings
of oneness, of communication –

00:09:23.927 --> 00:09:28.249
all that is in Shri Krishna. But She’s
the One who warns,

00:09:28.274 --> 00:09:33.192
and that is how the warning came. And She’s
a very fiery personality

00:09:33.217 --> 00:09:39.436
which warns everyone. So on one way
She has proved My coming here,

00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:44.910
that I’m here. Perhaps maybe to the people
who are aboriginals they might understand

00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:49.508
that this is what was prophesied and that
has happened,

00:09:49.508 --> 00:09:54.928
and also that you people have to realize:
it’s a warning

00:09:54.953 --> 00:09:59.973
that you cannot just allow Sahaja Yoga
to drift in such a manner

00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:03.874
that it takes its own course and works out,

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:08.118
and you are just by the way there.
So this is a warning

00:10:08.143 --> 00:10:12.484
of Shri Krishna’s Sister, Vishnumaya,
which is Saraswati Herself,

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:17.368
and that is what today we are going
to worship Her. Only the sahaja yogis,

00:10:17.393 --> 00:10:22.675
those who are enlightened people,
can worship Mahasaraswati.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.259
Otherwise people can only worship Saraswati
because with worship of Saraswati

00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:36.944
you can read books, you can create
dances, music,

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:42.134
for the amusement of human beings,
but actually the Saraswati Puja

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:48.931
is meant for people of ordinary awareness,

00:10:48.956 --> 00:10:52.193
means ordinary or normal human awareness.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:59.267
But for sahaja yogis, it is the
Mahasaraswati which is to be worshiped.

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:03.275
As I have told you this Mahasaraswati
becomes the Vishnumaya,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.818
and She is Vishnumaya so you have to be
person that you should,

00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:18.989
yourself should inform people like
the Vishnumaya does what Sahaja Yoga is

00:11:19.014 --> 00:11:23.694
with your fiery talks, with things
of exciting them,

00:11:23.719 --> 00:11:29.156
telling them what are you up to.
But what I have seen is that mostly

00:11:29.181 --> 00:11:36.306
when people speak they try to be very
gentle and sweet like Shri Krishna.

00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:39.555
We tried that in America, that it might
work with Americans,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.915
but it did not. They like people like say
that Graham fellow

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:50.240
or somebody like that who talks in a fiery
way. And I think this is what we have

00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:55.840
to learn from yesterday’s experience:
that you need really some fiery speakers

00:11:55.865 --> 00:12:01.206
and fiery people because they are not
at all sensitive

00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:07.752
to normal sensations. You see they,
all their sensations are dead I think

00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:12.703
they have become numb, and you have
to give them some shocks.

00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:16.728
They like shocks, you see. Newspapers
have to give them shocks,

00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:21.743
any event that is shocking – that can
only attract their attention.

00:12:21.768 --> 00:12:25.285
Even the music has to be so much
that it should break the rocks.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.678
So it should be such music that will just
break their heads.

00:12:29.703 --> 00:12:33.968
So they have become really rocky people,
and you have to

00:12:33.993 --> 00:12:38.357
understand that their rockiness can only
be shattered by Vishnumaya.

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:42.167
And that’s why this puja that we have
today in Vancouver

00:12:42.192 --> 00:12:49.382
has a very great significance – not only
for Canada, but also for America.

00:12:49.407 --> 00:12:54.696
Americans are taking for granted whatever
diseases coming today,

00:12:54.721 --> 00:12:58.166
whatever drugs they are taking, whatever
destruction they’re doing

00:12:58.191 --> 00:13:04.158
to themselves is still not in their
understanding.

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.368
They don’t understand what they’re doing
to themselves,

00:13:06.393 --> 00:13:08.017
how they’re destroying themselves,

00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:13.316
how such a precious human life they’re
wasting just for their own whim

00:13:13.341 --> 00:13:19.050
and for their so-called freedom. So it is
extremely, extremely important

00:13:19.075 --> 00:13:24.962
that you should try to tell them
in a fiery way, “What are you doing?

00:13:24.987 --> 00:13:28.981
Why are you deceiving yourself? Why don’t
you understand this is wrong?

00:13:29.006 --> 00:13:32.998
At least for the progeny, you tell them
that ‘We did this wrong,

00:13:33.023 --> 00:13:38.600
but you should not do it.'”All this kind
of talk has to be there

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:44.200
and people have to get ready for such
great speeches and things,

00:13:44.225 --> 00:13:51.685
but to say that people won’t like it,
I think is the other way round,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:56.042
unless and until you frighten them
they’re not going to be with you.

00:13:56.067 --> 00:13:58.546
So you have to tell and warn them

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.621
and that’s what the Vishnumaya yesterday
has suggested

00:14:01.646 --> 00:14:04.363
that now take to a new style of strategy

00:14:04.388 --> 00:14:09.557
and talk to people in a way that whenever
you are doing - say you are doing a course,

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:13.414
at the end of the course you have to say
that “Now, see, Sahaja Yoga is not for only

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:18.050
for doing course, but it’s for your
well being, for your benevolence.

00:14:18.075 --> 00:14:22.368
And you have to go further with it and you
have to grow. Now don’t leave it half way.”

00:14:22.393 --> 00:14:24.974
It’s not like just sprouting the seed,
but it has

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:28.963
to become the tree otherwise nobody
can be helped.

00:14:28.988 --> 00:14:37.940
So you see just tell them they – all the
dangers of not being properly brought up

00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:41.968
or matured in Sahaja Yoga. It has to be told

00:14:41.993 --> 00:14:46.391
because all this lovey-dovey business
doesn’t help in America, I’ve seen that.

00:14:46.416 --> 00:14:51.808
You need really fiery people because
recently I was listening to a speech

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:56.271
of this Billy Graham, and I said,
“It’s such an empty-headed fellow

00:14:56.296 --> 00:15:01.315
talks through his hat,” but still people
were so impressed.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.530
And there was another one now I think
he is behind jail.

00:15:04.555 --> 00:15:10.097
I don’t know his name, some funny man.
So I saw him also,

00:15:10.122 --> 00:15:15.220
I was surprised he was just talking
something empty, like empty shell

00:15:15.245 --> 00:15:18.699
and people were all mad after him
– thousands standing,

00:15:18.724 --> 00:15:21.317
singing, doing this, doing that.

00:15:21.342 --> 00:15:24.785
So one has to understand that these
people require shocks,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.912
and they’re to be shocked and they’re
to be told that “This is going to happen.”

00:15:28.937 --> 00:15:37.776
There’s one other organisation which has
gone into a kind of a shocking system

00:15:43.357 --> 00:15:48.328
is the [Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi]

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:54.544
Brahma Kumari, Brahma Kumari, you see
these Brahma Kumaris

00:15:54.569 --> 00:15:57.692
have become like lightnings and they
tell people –

00:15:57.717 --> 00:16:00.946
now they don’t tell that, “You are
destroyed,” what they tell,

00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:04.565
“This world is going to be destroyed,
everything is going to be destroyed

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.408
and you know you are not prepared for it,
what’s going to happen?”

00:16:08.433 --> 00:16:11.864
Same thing Jehovah Witness is doing,
the same thing. They are saying,

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:16.809
“This world is going to be destroyed,
and we are all going to be destroyed;

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:23.172
so we should be prepared and we should
take to God.”

00:16:23.663 --> 00:16:28.136
But this is not reality. Despite that
people are after them.

00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:35.520
You have to tell them the reality that
“Not only that you’re destroying yourself,

00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:39.887
but you’re destroying the future.”
People are already talking

00:16:39.912 --> 00:16:44.685
that most of the people in America
will be destroyed.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:50.249
Now it comes from various reasons. We can
say that there are no traditions and things

00:16:50.249 --> 00:16:52.900
– that’s not the point, that’s not
the main point.

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:56.039
One of the main points is that they
destroyed so many people

00:16:56.064 --> 00:17:00.872
when they came and settled down in this
country. That’s one point.

00:17:00.897 --> 00:17:07.139
Now the bhoots of those people who died
are still hanging around,

00:17:07.164 --> 00:17:12.389
and they want to see that they destroy
Americans as far as possible.

00:17:12.414 --> 00:17:17.426
The amount of witchcraft, the amount
of all negative techniques

00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:21.124
that are working in America, they’re
working nowhere.

00:17:21.149 --> 00:17:25.037
The gurus had to get out of
all the countries,

00:17:25.062 --> 00:17:28.447
but they’re still very nicely settled
in America.

00:17:28.472 --> 00:17:33.303
The reason is these bhoots are giving
them ideas. It’s not only that

00:17:33.328 --> 00:17:36.183
they need shocks, but also these bhoots
give them

00:17:36.208 --> 00:17:41.416
these perverted ideas of destruction,
so they go for their destruction.

00:17:41.441 --> 00:17:48.166
Now the bhootish ideas are such that
you see a person coming out of a pub,

00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:52.157
falls down. And a bhootish idea is that
“What’s the harm?

00:17:52.182 --> 00:17:55.667
You also try, you will never fall.
You go in, nothing will happen to you.

00:17:55.692 --> 00:17:59.961
You’re perfectly all right. After all,
doesn’t matter.”

00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:05.780
Or else you tell them that “This is wrong.
We should not do.”

00:18:05.805 --> 00:18:11.533
“All right, so we are bad. So what?”
These are all bhootish ideas.

00:18:11.558 --> 00:18:15.506
These are not human ideas to talk
like this or to say like that.

00:18:15.531 --> 00:18:22.161
So to all these people, you see, the only
thing that is going to bring round

00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:25.192
is the Vishnumaya Shakti, nothing else.

00:18:25.217 --> 00:18:29.770
I now realize that it’s only through
Vishnumaya people can be cured.

00:18:29.795 --> 00:18:36.317
So Vishnumaya Itself now has gone off
to sleep, thanks to Christian religion,

00:18:36.342 --> 00:18:40.186
Catholic religion and also Hinduism,
because in Hinduism also

00:18:40.211 --> 00:18:44.656
there is a idea of sin – that you have
sinned this, you have done that sin.

00:18:44.681 --> 00:18:47.928
So you give so much money to the Brahmin,
so you’ll be saved.

00:18:47.953 --> 00:18:50.487
I mean every religion has this nonsense.

00:18:50.512 --> 00:18:53.613
But this Vishnumaya Shakti, which is
being absolutely

00:18:53.638 --> 00:18:58.720
subdued and is sleeping in human beings,
if you can raise it and tell people

00:18:58.745 --> 00:19:03.847
to get up out of this slumber,
this laziness,

00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:11.454
by involving them very much in a bigger
way, by telling them that we are for peace,

00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:16.270
peace of the world. We are for
the emancipation of the humanity,

00:19:16.295 --> 00:19:22.564
we are for saving people from blunders
and from their destruction.

00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:30.188
If you take a bigger platform and talk
about those things, then it will be helped.

00:19:30.213 --> 00:19:35.234
For example, now it’s a very good thing
that I was with Mahatma Gandhi,

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:39.931
and people have got great respect
for Mahatma Gandhi.

00:19:39.956 --> 00:19:43.371
Of course and Mahatma Gandhi was very much
impressed about Me, no doubt.

00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:50.158
Even when I was a child, he used to consult
Me, and the proof of that is

00:19:50.183 --> 00:19:59.473
that in his bhajans he has put the serial
of the bhajans in different ways,

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:04.711
starting from the heart, talking about
the Atma and then he’s starting

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:10.185
from the Mooladhara upward, like that.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:16.375
So I mean that’s one of the proofs
that he must have consulted Me.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.868
But whatever it is, you have – can use
him also that Shri Mataji is doing

00:20:22.893 --> 00:20:28.188
what Mahatma Gandhi said. He has
talked about sarva dharma savanatma

00:20:28.213 --> 00:20:33.168
means all the religions are treated with
same respect and same understanding.

00:20:33.193 --> 00:20:36.782
Once you start talking like that, you see,
then people will understand

00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:41.032
that it has some noble heritage behind it,
because everybody wants to know

00:20:41.057 --> 00:20:44.454
from what book I’ve learnt. I mean,
I have never learnt from any book,

00:20:44.479 --> 00:20:48.707
that you know very well. But you can say
that “She is the One who was with him”

00:20:48.732 --> 00:20:51.474
and that “He was very much impressed
by Her,”

00:20:51.499 --> 00:20:55.114
and the same ideas of peace and non
violence and all that.

00:20:55.139 --> 00:20:58.943
“These are the same techniques
and methods She wants to use.”

00:20:58.968 --> 00:21:03.467
That’s a fact, no doubt, but Mahatma
Gandhi was a very fiery speaker.

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:07.242
All people who followed him were
very fiery.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:11.197
They were not just “All right, come along,
have a cup of tea”

00:21:11.222 --> 00:21:15.688
and this kind of thing is not going
to work out.

00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:22.900
So Americans need challenge, and they need
really a fiery person to blast them.

00:21:22.925 --> 00:21:26.460
So now if you go on this way –

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:29.885
like the other day when we had a program
in New York

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:37.639
and there were so many black people
and so many Chinese,

00:21:37.664 --> 00:21:42.733
and then there were so many Indians
and very few were whites.

00:21:42.758 --> 00:21:46.782
So whites came and say, “Oh, nothing
has happened to me, you know.”

00:21:46.807 --> 00:21:49.635
So then what you have to do,
“Nothing has happened?”

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.256
“Yes, that’s what.” “Must be something
wrong with you,

00:21:52.281 --> 00:21:55.152
or must be you must have committed
some sins or something.”

00:21:55.177 --> 00:21:58.565
So then they get a shock.

00:22:00.253 --> 00:22:03.939
“Oh, it’s something surprising. You haven’t
got it? Oh, it’s very wrong,

00:22:03.964 --> 00:22:06.576
something wrong with you. You should
get it. Try to get it, you know,

00:22:06.601 --> 00:22:11.629
it’s very wrong. I hope you don’t have
cancer.” Then...

00:22:17.362 --> 00:22:20.358
Or you can ask, “Are you suffering
from AIDS?” “No, no, no.”

00:22:20.354 --> 00:22:23.217
“Then what are you suffering from? How is
it you didn’t get it? You see

00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:28.012
this black man got it, this Chinese
has got it. Why don’t you get it?

00:22:28.037 --> 00:22:33.097
You are a white skin man, you should
get it first.”

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:40.141
Then things will work out. I have been
thinking about it, why these Americans

00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:45.444
are so dull, because you see they are
on the whole very dull people,

00:22:45.469 --> 00:22:49.205
extremely dull. Because this kind of a rock
music, you see, if you play

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:53.163
before anyone people would run away.
“What is this going on?”

00:22:53.188 --> 00:22:57.684
But the way they like this rap music
yesterday, they wanted Me to listen.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:01.143
The heart started beating the other way
round. I said, “What’s happening?”

00:23:01.143 --> 00:23:03.957
And the whole thing started shaking.
I sat on a bench

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:05.892
and the whole bench was shaking.

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:12.235
There, who sat with Me was, he was there
and also Karan was there

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:18.621
and we found that he – Karan and everybody
was jumping like that,

00:23:18.646 --> 00:23:26.614
on – it was like a earthquake going on.
So this is what it is, that you see

00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:31.924
these people are very, very dull people
and numbed out and they’re numbed out

00:23:31.949 --> 00:23:37.312
because of their so-called freedom.
It’s like you go and ask a bull,

00:23:37.337 --> 00:23:41.854
“Come and hit me,” sort of thing, you see.
They have gone out of the way

00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:45.476
to numb themselves completely;
and this numbness may be

00:23:45.476 --> 00:23:50.051
alcohol, may be drugs, may be woman,
may be marrying so many times.

00:23:50.076 --> 00:23:57.184
If you marry one time, it’s sufficient.
If you marry five times, I mean you become

00:23:57.209 --> 00:24:04.039
– I don’t know what, like a – I don’t know
if there’s any animal like that.

00:24:04.064 --> 00:24:07.648
But something you become absolutely
numb to things, you see.

00:24:07.673 --> 00:24:10.662
Because first of all marrying one wife,

00:24:10.687 --> 00:24:15.274
then you have attachments with her,
you have children and you – I mean

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:18.948
after all, it’s so much to do with
your wife

00:24:18.948 --> 00:24:24.705
and then suddenly you divorce and you
don’t feel anything, you don’t feel it.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:30.491
It’s great numbness and if you tell them,
“Yes, I know, I know, I know.”

00:24:30.516 --> 00:24:35.693
They know but they don’t feel. They don’t
feel that they’re doing anything wrong,

00:24:35.718 --> 00:24:40.732
they don’t feel they have done anything
absurd and they don’t suffer.

00:24:40.757 --> 00:24:45.701
Any other person would suffer. He has,
he has divorced his wife

00:24:45.726 --> 00:24:52.768
and it becomes really a person quite lost,
should be normally.

00:24:52.793 --> 00:24:57.655
But here what you find very nicely
boasting, “You know,

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:04.616
I have divorced my two wives, and this
third one is coming up. You can meet her.”

00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:09.964
So that there’s no shame about it,
no shame, no feelings, nothing.

00:25:09.989 --> 00:25:13.272
I mean you married a woman, you lived
with her, she was your wife

00:25:13.297 --> 00:25:16.321
and you have no feelings for her.
Your own children also

00:25:16.346 --> 00:25:21.111
they have no feelings at all, no feelings.
Of course they’re not like English,

00:25:21.136 --> 00:25:24.471
where the English people kill their
children, so that’s not so bad.

00:25:24.496 --> 00:25:28.481
But here I’ve heard also that they kill
husband, wife, kills each other

00:25:28.506 --> 00:25:33.233
and all that. And for what? For love. When
they do not have love for one husband,

00:25:33.258 --> 00:25:36.603
how are they going to have love for
another husband? I can’t understand.

00:25:36.628 --> 00:25:38.480
Love is a quality of heart.

00:25:38.505 --> 00:25:43.783
So this is what it is – if you see
the whole character is numbed out

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:46.774
because they don’t behave like human
beings.

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:50.596
They behave like – I don’t know, again
I say I don’t know like whom

00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:52.735
because there’s no comparison
whatsoever.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.995
So it is not that only in America people
are like that, it's all over.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:04.487
But in America it is too much, too much of
it, and all such things rise from America.

00:26:04.512 --> 00:26:10.084
All such funny notions rise from America,
and everybody takes them

00:26:10.109 --> 00:26:20.544
because they know how to advertise, they
know how to make it very, very popular.

00:26:20.569 --> 00:26:26.373
Once I was travelling by a ship

00:26:26.398 --> 00:26:29.530
and a pilot came over the ship,
and he was talking to Me

00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:33.920
and he told Me that his brother is
a very nasty devil.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.612
I said, “What happened?” So he said
that he got hold of

00:26:38.637 --> 00:26:43.017
these four boys who were Beatles,
and he became their manager.

00:26:43.042 --> 00:26:47.828
And he started this music and got
some women,

00:26:47.853 --> 00:26:50.455
got them drunk, put them on drugs.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.300
And the first music when they had
that music,

00:26:54.325 --> 00:26:58.037
these girls started screaming, shouting,
going mad.

00:26:58.062 --> 00:27:02.116
And it became popular. Normally
the reaction would be that,

00:27:02.141 --> 00:27:06.559
“Ba, it’s such a thing that when the music
starts the girls go mad,

00:27:06.584 --> 00:27:10.814
so don’t go to such a music.” On the
contrary, so many started coming.

00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:15.435
How do you explain this kind of a reaction?
The more they shout, the more they scream,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.901
according to them it’s something.
Means behind it

00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:28.279
is one thing that it has touched them
somehow; otherwise, why will they scream?

00:27:28.304 --> 00:27:33.403
Means such dumb people have been touched
by something is something great

00:27:33.428 --> 00:27:39.584
and all of us should go. We are also dumb,
so we should attend to it.

00:27:39.609 --> 00:27:47.530
Now you may ask Me that “Mother how this
dumbness has come into people and this?”

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:51.561
Is as simple as that as I told you,
that they’ve used their freedom

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:56.817
to such an extent, their attention to such
a wasteful pursuits,

00:27:56.842 --> 00:28:00.553
that they have become really numb.
Their attention doesn’t feel anything.

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:06.771
Attention when you put it out it reacts,
and it comes back to you as something.

00:28:06.796 --> 00:28:11.022
But if you all the time go on bombarding
outside your attention,

00:28:11.047 --> 00:28:15.479
this some bombardment from outside
just finishes all your sensitivity.

00:28:15.504 --> 00:28:20.000
There’s no feeling, there’s no attachment,

00:28:20.025 --> 00:28:27.540
there is no, no recording of anything
that is happening.

00:28:27.565 --> 00:28:30.434
So for that I think Vishnumaya is needed,

00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:34.797
and that’s why She’s placed on the left
side because Vishnumaya

00:28:34.822 --> 00:28:40.365
is the One in charge of people who have
become absolutely feelingless.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.849
That’s why She’s there to give you
the feeling.

00:28:42.874 --> 00:28:46.993
So on the left side when She shines
She gives you the feelings,

00:28:47.018 --> 00:28:51.747
and people start understanding. So now
the only thing that they have is

00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:57.556
a kind of a mental idea that they’re
guilty, that’s all.

00:28:57.581 --> 00:29:02.094
This is just mental. If it is mental idea,
“Oh, I’m guilty,”

00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:07.188
then you are not going to feel it. I mean
if you are, say that you are mad,

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:11.929
when you’re not mad if anybody calls you
mad you are not going to feel it.

00:29:11.954 --> 00:29:14.757
It’s like this. So they don’t feel it
at all

00:29:14.782 --> 00:29:19.604
because it is all mentally accepted thing
and they have become numb,

00:29:19.629 --> 00:29:24.640
“Now nobody can harm you, so what’s wrong?”
sort of an attitude.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.508
I would now ask you people to go all out
and become fiery,

00:29:29.533 --> 00:29:33.951
write in newspapers and say what’s
happening and how things are.

00:29:33.976 --> 00:29:38.316
I’m writing a book like that now.
It’s called as Meta Modernism,

00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:43.218
and as far as I could be fiery I’m going
to be there

00:29:43.243 --> 00:29:46.394
to tell them what’s wrong with them.
And they should see to it

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:53.968
that this is all wrong. No use trying
to call it something great.

00:29:53.993 --> 00:29:57.735
Like now AIDS have come up. I thought
with AIDS, they will be awakened.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.365
So now the AIDS have become a martyrdom.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.136
Now the yuppies, the yuppies came up,
I said,

00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:07.202
“The yuppies will suffer from a disease.”
So now they said,

00:30:07.227 --> 00:30:10.180
“No, no, no, no. It’s very nice to be
yuppies. After all you see

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.277
they are another heroes who died
for their yuppism.”

00:30:14.302 --> 00:30:19.072
Like you see, every stupidity is made
into a something,

00:30:19.097 --> 00:30:22.633
kind of a very glorifying thing,

00:30:22.658 --> 00:30:28.840
so just – and people accept it. That’s
the best part of it – they accept it.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.521
So it is important for you to be fiery,
and to show them

00:30:32.546 --> 00:30:35.558
in that light what they are. They have
to be shown.

00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:40.580
It’s not just a little light of the Spirit
will show them much,

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:49.981
but it’s the real dazzling, burning light
of a lightning.

00:30:50.006 --> 00:30:53.368
So today’s puja is going to be specially

00:30:53.393 --> 00:31:00.002
for you all to develop that creativity
of talking,

00:31:00.027 --> 00:31:03.470
behaving in every way in a fiery way.

00:31:03.495 --> 00:31:07.756
That is going to put them right,
nothing else.

00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:10.953
In creative work also, when we create
something

00:31:10.978 --> 00:31:14.191
or we sing something and all that,

00:31:14.216 --> 00:31:20.047
if you go on singing, say, in our Indian
style, some music which is

00:31:20.072 --> 00:31:23.871
“vilambit tala” you see, very slow “talas”,
that won’t come up.

00:31:23.896 --> 00:31:28.230
They like somebody like Ravi Shankar
who just goes on mixing up notes

00:31:28.255 --> 00:31:33.735
and just goes on playing something which
is very, very unscientific

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.534
according to Indians things, is not at all
entertaining, it doesn’t open your heart

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:42.784
and something like that. But, that is
the thing that appeals to them,

00:31:42.804 --> 00:31:49.376
to go into a big sort of a rock and roll
sort – make it, sitar

00:31:49.401 --> 00:31:53.200
into rock and roll, and even worse than
that. I don’t know the new, latest one

00:31:53.225 --> 00:31:57.795
I don’t know what it is. So the second
thing is that you can see

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.134
how they try to shock people. Also they
try to shock people,

00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:06.080
because they know that they are also
like us. Like you go in the market,

00:32:06.105 --> 00:32:11.552
you find somebody, his pant is – not pant
even, half pant –

00:32:11.577 --> 00:32:18.055
is all torn at wrong places, and it is
just to shock people.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.179
They are supposed to, here at least,
they are supposed to,

00:32:22.204 --> 00:32:25.489
in America it is supposed to be, you have
to dress up

00:32:25.514 --> 00:32:28.479
decently. You should not be indecently
dressed.

00:32:28.504 --> 00:32:33.018
That’s what they want. But, what you find,
whatever chance they can get

00:32:33.043 --> 00:32:37.206
to dress up in a way that you’ll be
shocked, they would like to do.

00:32:37.231 --> 00:32:40.814
Like they’ll have only one part
of the hair as white.

00:32:40.839 --> 00:32:44.412
I mean anything, anything is possible
just to shock others,

00:32:44.437 --> 00:32:49.935
shock others and attract the attention.
And what do you get? Nothing.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.810
You spend so much money to attract the
attention of others, but what do you get?

00:32:53.835 --> 00:32:56.992
That attention doesn’t give you anything,
doesn’t pay you anything,

00:32:57.017 --> 00:33:02.079
doesn’t compensate. So it’s such
a joyless pursuit they get into.

00:33:02.104 --> 00:33:06.641
All these things spoil their attention,
which destroys it to this extent

00:33:06.666 --> 00:33:11.412
that they’re feelingless people.
They have no feelings left.

00:33:11.437 --> 00:33:15.179
And then the worse thing that has
happened is they have become

00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:18.889
absolutely money-orientated.

00:33:20.154 --> 00:33:25.428
So the money is another side of Saraswati.

00:33:25.453 --> 00:33:33.254
Saraswati is different from Lakshmi,

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:38.432
so the Lakshmi and Saraswati never go
hand in hand.

00:33:38.457 --> 00:33:42.766
This is the reason why when they get
after Lakshmi,

00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:47.071
run after money too much, they get shocks.

00:33:47.096 --> 00:33:50.994
Because there’s a – suddenly you find
the stock exchange has fallen,

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:55.346
there’s a recession, this business is gone,
somebody who’s very rich

00:33:55.371 --> 00:34:00.050
suddenly becomes a poor man.
Is all the work,

00:34:00.075 --> 00:34:04.417
this is all the work of the Saraswati.

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:09.846
And if somebody is too much in Saraswati
– reads too many books,

00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:14.891
is an artist who is very ambitious,

00:34:14.916 --> 00:34:18.837
who tries to outshine other artist
and all that –

00:34:18.862 --> 00:34:23.427
such a person also gets back a reward
from Lakshmi

00:34:23.452 --> 00:34:27.336
that his things never sell, he never gets
money, he starves,

00:34:27.361 --> 00:34:33.919
all sorts of thing. So these two things
are in balance only in Hamsa,

00:34:33.944 --> 00:34:38.504
or we can say they are in balance
when you are a sahaja yogi.

00:34:38.529 --> 00:34:45.472
So this has to be achieved and is to be
put together in balance

00:34:45.497 --> 00:34:51.479
that you have the blessings of
Saraswati as well as that of Lakshmi.

00:34:51.504 --> 00:34:56.785
But it crosses only at the Hamsa point
and at the Vishuddhi point.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:03.054
So what we have to do to bring
the balance is that whatever

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:08.753
we are earning, whatever we are doing,
we should not be in a mediocre way.

00:35:08.778 --> 00:35:15.253
We should try to do it in a dynamic way,
in a fiery way.

00:35:15.688 --> 00:35:20.003
These two things should be combined
at the Vishuddhi level.

00:35:20.028 --> 00:35:29.602
So now, supposing you are going to give
a lecture about Sahaja Yoga in a fiery way,

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:35.500
and if you wear a dress that you look like
a hippie or somebody coming out of a jail,

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.574
nobody is going to take you seriously.
But if you’re properly dressed

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:43.391
and you look respectable and presentation
is good,

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:48.261
and then you give a fiery speech,
everybody is going to listen.

00:35:48.286 --> 00:35:55.597
So this principle of Lakshmi Tattwa
is to be used

00:35:55.622 --> 00:35:59.534
with the domination of the Saraswati
principle.

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:08.518
Now another blessings of Saraswati is that
you can have knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:08.543 --> 00:36:13.485
I’ve seen many women especially
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:14.473 --> 00:36:18.301
they’re sahaja yogis, they have vibrations,
all that is there,

00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:23.216
but they do not know what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:23.241 --> 00:36:28.054
They do not know what these chakras are.

00:36:28.054 --> 00:36:32.457
They do not know that how these vibrations
go out.

00:36:32.482 --> 00:36:37.791
Now today’s lecture is quite a lecture
quite complicated I would say,

00:36:37.816 --> 00:36:42.530
if you see to it. You have to listen to it
at least four, five times to understand it

00:36:42.555 --> 00:36:45.780
with the paper and a pencil. It’s not
an easy thing

00:36:45.805 --> 00:36:48.667
because I’m telling you now it’s all right,
it’s quite entertaining,

00:36:48.692 --> 00:36:53.595
but behind the entertainment there is
a deep knowledge.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:59.513
So I’ve not seen the sahaja yoginis
mostly sit down with a paper and pencil

00:36:59.538 --> 00:37:03.768
to know what is Mother saying,

00:37:03.793 --> 00:37:07.814
what is the knowledge She’s giving us
about the various things.

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:14.545
To them Sahaja Yoga means to be nice,
to cook good food

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:21.660
and help the sahaja yogis, and that
of course for the pujas to wear nice saris

00:37:21.685 --> 00:37:28.345
and nice dresses, come to the pujas
and all that and finished, also.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:34.272
So for them it is very important that they
should also know what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:34.297 --> 00:37:39.706
They must listen to My lectures, sit down,
study it nicely and understand it.

00:37:39.731 --> 00:37:45.694
The other way round are the men.
For them it is to do all the outside work,

00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:55.438
go round, see things and all that. But
as far as relationships are concerned,

00:37:55.463 --> 00:38:00.981
or as far as emotional side are concerned,
they’re negligent.

00:38:01.006 --> 00:38:04.362
And that is why Sahaja Yoga by men
is different;

00:38:04.387 --> 00:38:06.588
Sahaja Yoga by women is different.

00:38:06.613 --> 00:38:11.511
And in France specially it has gone
very far away from each other.

00:38:11.536 --> 00:38:14.186
The women were on one side, man are
on other side.

00:38:14.211 --> 00:38:17.974
Imagine in Sahaja Yoga you have such
a nonsense as that,

00:38:17.999 --> 00:38:21.636
but then we discovered the person who
was doing it and we managed it,

00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:24.346
so it was settled down and now things
are better.

00:38:24.371 --> 00:38:29.373
But women must know about Sahaja Yoga,
but that doesn’t mean

00:38:29.398 --> 00:38:32.944
that they should fight with them, or think
that they also know

00:38:32.969 --> 00:38:38.967
what these men know. But it’s very,
very common. I’ve seen that men

00:38:38.992 --> 00:38:43.945
and women are having a different type
of attitude towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:47.085
One is an extravert, another is
an introvert.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.212
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no difference
between a woman and a man

00:38:51.237 --> 00:38:55.733
as far as knowing Sahaja Yoga is concerned.
I’m a woman Myself

00:38:55.758 --> 00:39:00.786
and I know so much, so why not the woman
shouldn’t know about what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:39:00.811 --> 00:39:06.630
So all the women who are here or all over
have to know what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:06.655 --> 00:39:13.493
After all, look at Vishnumaya – She is
a woman, is the Power that works.

00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:16.923
Brahmadeva doesn’t work. He’s created
all these things because

00:39:16.948 --> 00:39:21.346
He has the Power of Saraswati, otherwise
He could not have created.

00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:24.964
So everything is done through the Power
and the Power is a woman,

00:39:24.989 --> 00:39:27.219
but if the Power doesn’t know what is
Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:27.244 --> 00:39:31.043
how is She going to work it out?

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.031
So the women, though they have children,
I know –

00:39:34.056 --> 00:39:38.600
they have to look after the household,
kitchen – but it’s such a pleasure,

00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:43.820
such a joy to read about Sahaja Yoga,
to understand it, to know it.

00:39:43.845 --> 00:39:48.725
Of course some of them do also read.
I’m not saying that they do not.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:53.874
But there are very, very few and they
are very sensible, very sensible.

00:39:53.899 --> 00:40:01.310
So this is My understanding of today’s
happening that in this natural surrounding,

00:40:01.335 --> 00:40:07.804
these natural surrounding where we are
blessed by the work of Brahmadeva

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:15.409
and Saraswati, and where we can feel
the capacity of these Deities,

00:40:15.434 --> 00:40:22.011
to what extent They can create.
The nature is absolutely one

00:40:22.036 --> 00:40:28.477
with the Divine. Now see, as soon as
I came here the nature knew I’m there.

00:40:28.502 --> 00:40:32.189
It just started acting by itself. I didn’t
have to give them a lecture,

00:40:32.214 --> 00:40:35.159
they didn’t have to do a puja, nothing
of the kind.

00:40:35.184 --> 00:40:38.445
They knew what I was doing. I went
to Los Angeles, same thing.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.667
Anywhere I go the nature knows what is
to be done,

00:40:41.692 --> 00:40:47.160
“Now Mother is in the town, what should
we do?” And they do it.

00:40:47.185 --> 00:40:52.602
So this is the trouble, is that I have made
you to do all kinds of deliberations

00:40:52.627 --> 00:40:56.581
for human beings that “All right, do this,
do that, do that.”

00:40:56.606 --> 00:41:01.474
But I would say that spontaneously it
should act, because now we are one.

00:41:01.499 --> 00:41:04.743
Just like the nature is one with Me,
you are also one with Me.

00:41:04.768 --> 00:41:12.135
And that should start happening when
you will really become absolutely

00:41:12.174 --> 00:41:18.490
drawn into Sahaja Yoga, surrendered into
Sahaja Yoga, then only it will happen.

00:41:18.515 --> 00:41:21.563
May God bless you all.
