00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:13.470
So mainly your attention has to be all right.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:21.423
Attention has to be concentrated upon your Spirit.

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:26.930
Then you become the best instrument,

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:30.391
your attention very powerful.

00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:33.855
It’s not… nothing outside.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:39.938
Like, you may think that if you develop a big beard and a moustache

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:44.160
and long hair and sit down like Guru Nanaka,

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.529
you don’t become Guru Nanaka.

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:51.040
It is not outside; it’s the inside state.

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:56.588
The inside state has to be perfected.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.617
I know I am Mahamaya,

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.680
but you are very lucky people

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.077
because I always remind you I am Mahamaya first of all.

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:20.023
And the another point is that you have somebody with you

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:22.922
to tell you and guide you

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:28.625
which none of the saints had, none of the Incarnations had,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.890
none of the Prophets had

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:36.638
So please take full advantage.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:43.947
Have full advantage of being My children

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:49.163
and bringing more and more seekers to Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:57.519
So today, I would like you to have your awareness of your powers.

00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:00.919
You are sitting on top of a mountain,

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.476
and you are sitting on top of the evolution now.

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:09.677
In knowledge, you are the greatest yogis;

00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:14.019
in power, you are the greatest yogis.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.347
You can become the greatest saints in righteousness and dharma.

00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:26.597
Where you lack is the dedication and devotion,

00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:29.220
the pure desire.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.828
Like, these yogis used to go in the jungles,

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:42.360
live there with the wild animals

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:47.640
and used to practice meditation to achieve self-realization,

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:52.588
years after years, lives after lives,

00:02:55.867 --> 00:03:00.465
because they had a pure desire so strong within them.

00:03:01.192 --> 00:03:04.666
But in Sahaja Yoga you move one step and you get blessings,

00:03:04.753 --> 00:03:07.421
you move another step you get another blessing;

00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:11.249
it is nothing but blessings all the time.

00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:14.117
You are blessed every moment.

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:17.236
But sometimes also must know,

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:20.042
because of Mahamaya character of your Mother,

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:23.668
these blessings are temptations.

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:27.238
So be aware of it

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:33.847
and try to keep, with humility, yourself in the center.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.680
It’s like ego, you see, because like this air you go up;

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:43.408
and like these balloons, any fashion comes in,

00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:46.975
you all go in the same direction anywhere it can take you.

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:51.794
But thank God, there is a string which is tied.

00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:56.536
So, we have to be solid pillars of Sahaja Yoga

00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:01.283
creating the roof for all the seekers of the world,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.631
for the emancipation of humanity.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:08.573
Of course, pujas, you know that you go deep.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:13.994
You go very deep into pujas, you touch very great depths.

00:04:15.517 --> 00:04:18.137
But that is My doing.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.455
What is your doing is to seek out that depth,

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:28.523
keep up the enjoyment of that doing.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.575
May God bless you all.
