00:05.372 --> 00:09.341
Your life gets filled up with lots of miracles.

00:13.490 --> 00:17.924
In Sahaja Yoga miracle has lost it's meaning.

00:21.577 --> 00:24.600
Saha means ”with”, ja means “born”.

00:29.946 --> 00:34.430
That is this power of becoming one with the Divine is born with you.

00:39.739 --> 00:41.801
And you have a birthright to get it.

00:44.371 --> 00:49.676
Specially these are very important times.

00:53.112 --> 00:55.495
What we call as the Last Judgment.

00:58.027 --> 01:01.112
But I call it as the blossom time

01:03.099 --> 01:06.685
where many flowers are going to get their fruits.

01:10.887 --> 01:13.644
These are very special times

01:14.457 --> 01:18.730
when you are tortured, you are troubled, you are unhappy

01:23.124 --> 01:25.545
and have many illusions.

01:27.436 --> 01:29.788
At this time it works so fast.

01:32.865 --> 01:36.249
I'm amazed how it is spreading.

01:39.979 --> 01:42.580
It is something you must understand

01:42.781 --> 01:45.580
is a living process of your evolution.

01:49.628 --> 01:53.448
This is the last break-through of your evolution.

01:59.139 --> 02:01.748
Specially in your country

02:01.952 --> 02:06.667
I find people are extremely sensitive to spirituality.

02:12.143 --> 02:16.080
I don't know how so many have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

02:20.333 --> 02:21.778
Is very remarkable.

02:23.489 --> 02:28.684
All over the world I am praising people from Ukraine and from Russia.

02:32.891 --> 02:36.697
Must be something of previous lives -

02:36.898 --> 02:38.976
I just can't explain.

02:44.470 --> 02:49.266
But in our books it written that two great saints called

02:49.485 --> 02:54.119
[SOUNDS LIKE Machindarnath] and [SOUNDS
LIKE Goraknath] came to Ukraine and to Russia.

03:02.297 --> 03:07.485
And there they described that there are lots man of God living there.

03:13.791 --> 03:15.746
And they taught them about Kundalini

03:15.947 --> 03:19.996
because I can see on your terracottas

03:20.197 --> 03:23.351
of those times there is Kundalini everywhere

03:34.045 --> 03:35.920
and the chakras and all those

03:38.777 --> 03:40.988
drown on those terracotta pots.

03:45.472 --> 03:47.938
So I think you are especially blessed people.

03:51.339 --> 03:55.927
I'm very happy I could come to Ukraine and meet you

03:56.173 --> 03:59.394
and talk to you about so simple.

04:07.699 --> 04:11.328
If you have any problems you can always write to Me.

04:15.442 --> 04:17.822
But mostly what I receive

04:18.023 --> 04:22.315
the letters are about how they are enjoying life, how they are happy.

04:31.039 --> 04:35.843
Last but not the least you jump into the ocean of joy.

04:41.872 --> 04:46.981
All the wrong things we do to get some enjoyment.

04:52.742 --> 04:56.351
But then we don't have to do anything, we don't have to achieve anything,

04:56.552 --> 04:59.414
you are just in the ocean of joy.

05:06.804 --> 05:10.061
Joy is not

05:10.771 --> 05:14.403
like happiness or unhappiness, it's singular.

05:19.591 --> 05:24.201
That everything then starts giving you joy,

05:24.435 --> 05:27.930
everything you see gives you joy.

05:33.045 --> 05:36.341
If there is anything ridiculous, you laugh.

05:39.490 --> 05:42.716
If there is anything cruel,

05:42.943 --> 05:45.177
you get defective on that.

05:49.660 --> 05:54.879
And the even a cruel personality can become very nice and sweet.

06:00.737 --> 06:05.253
These are the science of saintliness.

06:07.698 --> 06:09.386
And you become saints

06:11.494 --> 06:13.229
and enjoy your saintliness.

06:15.447 --> 06:18.001
For that you don't have to give up your family,

06:18.202 --> 06:19.989
give up your household,

06:20.190 --> 06:22.876
go to Himalayas or stand on your head.

06:29.970 --> 06:31.391
It is just within you.

06:33.110 --> 06:34.196
And it acts.

06:35.547 --> 06:36.969
It will work.

06:38.547 --> 06:42.304
I am sure things would be much easier for you.

06:46.417 --> 06:49.424
May God bless you.

06:54.821 --> 06:57.571
Should we have some music little bit?

06:57.993 --> 06:59.964
Could have one song.

07:00.165 --> 07:02.311
Before no, no. Before no. Later on.

07:02.530 --> 07:05.797
First I let people to get Realization.

07:07.537 --> 07:10.990
I’ll give one Realization then you sing one song.

07:17.792 --> 07:21.893
Now those who do not want to have I can not force.

07:27.884 --> 07:31.876
You have to have your own judgment.

07:35.849 --> 07:37.968
But it’s very easy, it won’t trouble you,

07:38.169 --> 07:40.747
on the contrary, you’ll feel very much elated.

07:48.791 --> 07:53.087
So those who want to go should go now, but don’t disturb later on.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.880
It will hardly take five to ten minutes.

08:04.793 --> 08:08.707
First of all none of you should feel guilty for anything.

08:12.590 --> 08:15.556
You have not to confess anything to Me.

08:18.339 --> 08:22.698
Whatever wrong has been done, it was in the past.

08:26.314 --> 08:28.042
You have to be in the present.

08:30.331 --> 08:35.481
And for that you should be angry with yourself

08:35.682 --> 08:38.696
for anything that was done wrong in the past.

08:43.626 --> 08:47.177
But if you feel guilty then you catch on this center on the left hand side.

08:55.581 --> 08:59.292
With that you get diseases like angina,

08:59.493 --> 09:02.962
like spondylitis, like lethargic organs.

09:10.790 --> 09:14.267
And at this moment the Kundalini won’t pass through.

09:17.603 --> 09:21.636
Now there’s another problem that you must forgive yourself,

09:21.837 --> 09:25.087
also in the same way forgive others.

09:31.273 --> 09:33.945
Many say that it’s difficult to forgive.

09:36.445 --> 09:39.636
But whether you forgive or you don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

09:43.886 --> 09:47.582
Actually by not forgiving you torture yourself.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.295
You just have to say in your heart,

09:53.496 --> 09:57.425
“Mother, I forgive everyone,” and you’ll feel much lighter.

10:04.245 --> 10:06.382
Also you should not think

10:06.582 --> 10:09.113
whom you have to forgive because it’s a headache.

10:15.058 --> 10:19.410
So you forgive yourself and forgive others.

10:24.094 --> 10:27.545
And also if you can take out your shoes,

10:27.746 --> 10:29.336
will be very helpful.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.255
Please take out your shoes.

10:40.780 --> 10:44.272
This center is like this – very constricted.

10:49.586 --> 10:52.179
And if you don’t forgive it won’t open.

10:55.265 --> 10:57.749
And this is a very important time.

10:58.022 --> 11:02.382
If you don’t forgive now you’ll miss the chance of your evolution.

11:15.701 --> 11:19.365
Now just put both your hands towards Me like this.

11:31.521 --> 11:33.357
Now put down your head

11:33.558 --> 11:38.607
and put your right hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

11:38.808 --> 11:42.019
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

11:53.610 --> 11:56.906
Now see for yourself if there’s a cool or a hot

11:57.106 --> 12:01.207
breeze like vibrations coming out of your own fontanel bone area.

12:10.982 --> 12:13.436
Now don’t doubt yourself.

12:17.381 --> 12:20.524
Some people get it closer, some people get it far away.

12:24.265 --> 12:27.179
But don’t please put your hand on top of your head.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.710
Now please put your right hand towards Me.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.020
And now again bend your head,

12:42.455 --> 12:46.123
and see with your left hand if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

12:46.324 --> 12:48.228
coming out of your head.

12:55.948 --> 12:58.533
It is hot because you have not forgiven yourself

12:58.734 --> 13:00.510
or you have not forgiven others.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.011
Please bend your head.

13:10.152 --> 13:14.143
So now you forgive yourself and others.

13:21.855 --> 13:24.339
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

13:26.519 --> 13:31.403
Again, once again, please put your head down

13:31.604 --> 13:33.444
and see with your right hand

13:33.645 --> 13:36.354
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head.

13:43.945 --> 13:47.781
If it is still hot then please forgive yourself and others.

13:56.562 --> 13:58.968
Now,

13:59.538 --> 14:03.054
please put both your hands towards the sky like this.

14:06.209 --> 14:08.130
And push back your head.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.176
And ask one of these questions,

14:12.377 --> 14:14.622
one of these questions three times.

14:19.054 --> 14:20.924
You can call Me Mother

14:21.125 --> 14:23.593
or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.611
Now please ask in your heart,

14:29.868 --> 14:33.364
“Mother, is this a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

14:40.000 --> 14:45.674
Or, “Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

14:50.909 --> 14:54.773
Or, thirdly, “Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya?”

14:59.664 --> 15:03.057
You can ask anyone of these one question three times.

15:06.729 --> 15:09.152
Now bring down your hands.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.795
Put both the hands towards Me. Please bring down your hands.

15:20.312 --> 15:23.384
If you are getting cool breeze

15:23.585 --> 15:27.692
on your fingertips or

15:28.954 --> 15:32.825
on the palm

15:33.026 --> 15:38.056
or out of your fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.418
Like flags.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.168
Flags of peace and joy.

16:03.925 --> 16:05.850
Tremendous, I tell.

16:07.159 --> 16:10.791
May God bless you all.

16:12.588 --> 16:17.353
This is the beginning but you have to meditate, that’s very important.

16:21.634 --> 16:23.059
And grow into it.

16:24.424 --> 16:26.494
You don’t have to pay for it.

16:28.236 --> 16:29.744
It’s a living process.

16:31.127 --> 16:33.668
And you can not pay for any living process.

16:36.832 --> 16:38.113
Don’t doubt yourself.

16:42.742 --> 16:45.386
Thank you. May God bless you.

16:47.109 --> 16:48.436
Now they can sing.
