00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:09.341
Your life gets filled up with lots of miracles.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.924
In Sahaja Yoga miracle has lost it's meaning.

00:00:21.577 --> 00:00:24.600
Saha means ”with”, ja means “born”.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:34.430
That is this power of becoming one with the Divine is born with you.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.801
And you have a birthright to get it.

00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:49.676
Specially these are very important times.

00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:55.495
What we call as the Last Judgment.

00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:01.112
But I call it as the blossom time

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:06.685
where many flowers are going to get their fruits.

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:13.644
These are very special times

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:18.730
when you are tortured, you are troubled, you are unhappy

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:25.545
and have many illusions.

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:29.788
At this time it works so fast.

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:36.249
I'm amazed how it is spreading.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.580
It is something you must understand

00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.580
is a living process of your evolution.

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:53.448
This is the last break-through of your evolution.

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.748
Specially in your country

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:06.667
I find people are extremely sensitive to spirituality.

00:02:12.143 --> 00:02:16.080
I don't know how so many have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:21.778
Is very remarkable.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.684
All over the world I am praising people from Ukraine and from Russia.

00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:36.697
Must be something of previous lives -

00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:38.976
I just can't explain.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.266
But in our books it written that two great saints called

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:54.119
[SOUNDS LIKE Machindarnath] and [SOUNDS
LIKE Goraknath] came to Ukraine and to Russia.

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:07.485
And there they described that there are lots man of God living there.

00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:15.746
And they taught them about Kundalini

00:03:15.947 --> 00:03:19.996
because I can see on your terracottas

00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:23.351
of those times there is Kundalini everywhere

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:35.920
and the chakras and all those

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:40.988
drown on those terracotta pots.

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:47.938
So I think you are especially blessed people.

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.927
I'm very happy I could come to Ukraine and meet you

00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:59.394
and talk to you about so simple.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:11.328
If you have any problems you can always write to Me.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:17.822
But mostly what I receive

00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:22.315
the letters are about how they are enjoying life, how they are happy.

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.843
Last but not the least you jump into the ocean of joy.

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:46.981
All the wrong things we do to get some enjoyment.

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:56.351
But then we don't have to do anything, we don't have to achieve anything,

00:04:56.552 --> 00:04:59.414
you are just in the ocean of joy.

00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:10.061
Joy is not

00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:14.403
like happiness or unhappiness, it's singular.

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:24.201
That everything then starts giving you joy,

00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:27.930
everything you see gives you joy.

00:05:33.045 --> 00:05:36.341
If there is anything ridiculous, you laugh.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.716
If there is anything cruel,

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.177
you get defective on that.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.879
And the even a cruel personality can become very nice and sweet.

00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:05.253
These are the science of saintliness.

00:06:07.698 --> 00:06:09.386
And you become saints

00:06:11.494 --> 00:06:13.229
and enjoy your saintliness.

00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:18.001
For that you don't have to give up your family,

00:06:18.202 --> 00:06:19.989
give up your household,

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.876
go to Himalayas or stand on your head.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.391
It is just within you.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.196
And it acts.

00:06:35.547 --> 00:06:36.969
It will work.

00:06:38.547 --> 00:06:42.304
I am sure things would be much easier for you.

00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:49.424
May God bless you.

00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:57.571
Should we have some music little bit?

00:06:57.993 --> 00:06:59.964
Could have one song.

00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:02.311
Before no, no. Before no. Later on.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.797
First I let people to get Realization.

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:10.990
I’ll give one Realization then you sing one song.

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:21.893
Now those who do not want to have I can not force.

00:07:27.884 --> 00:07:31.876
You have to have your own judgment.

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:37.968
But it’s very easy, it won’t trouble you,

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:40.747
on the contrary, you’ll feel very much elated.

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.087
So those who want to go should go now, but don’t disturb later on.

00:07:58.083 --> 00:08:00.880
It will hardly take five to ten minutes.

00:08:04.793 --> 00:08:08.707
First of all none of you should feel guilty for anything.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.556
You have not to confess anything to Me.

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:22.698
Whatever wrong has been done, it was in the past.

00:08:26.314 --> 00:08:28.042
You have to be in the present.

00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:35.481
And for that you should be angry with yourself

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.696
for anything that was done wrong in the past.

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:47.177
But if you feel guilty then you catch on this center on the left hand side.

00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:59.292
With that you get diseases like angina,

00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:02.962
like spondylitis, like lethargic organs.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.267
And at this moment the Kundalini won’t pass through.

00:09:17.603 --> 00:09:21.636
Now there’s another problem that you must forgive yourself,

00:09:21.837 --> 00:09:25.087
also in the same way forgive others.

00:09:31.273 --> 00:09:33.945
Many say that it’s difficult to forgive.

00:09:36.445 --> 00:09:39.636
But whether you forgive or you don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:47.582
Actually by not forgiving you torture yourself.

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:53.295
You just have to say in your heart,

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:57.425
“Mother, I forgive everyone,” and you’ll feel much lighter.

00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:06.382
Also you should not think

00:10:06.582 --> 00:10:09.113
whom you have to forgive because it’s a headache.

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:19.410
So you forgive yourself and forgive others.

00:10:24.094 --> 00:10:27.545
And also if you can take out your shoes,

00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:29.336
will be very helpful.

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:38.255
Please take out your shoes.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.272
This center is like this – very constricted.

00:10:49.586 --> 00:10:52.179
And if you don’t forgive it won’t open.

00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:57.749
And this is a very important time.

00:10:58.022 --> 00:11:02.382
If you don’t forgive now you’ll miss the chance of your evolution.

00:11:15.701 --> 00:11:19.365
Now just put both your hands towards Me like this.

00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:33.357
Now put down your head

00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:38.607
and put your right hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:42.019
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.906
Now see for yourself if there’s a cool or a hot

00:11:57.106 --> 00:12:01.207
breeze like vibrations coming out of your own fontanel bone area.

00:12:10.982 --> 00:12:13.436
Now don’t doubt yourself.

00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:20.524
Some people get it closer, some people get it far away.

00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:27.179
But don’t please put your hand on top of your head.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.710
Now please put your right hand towards Me.

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.020
And now again bend your head,

00:12:42.455 --> 00:12:46.123
and see with your left hand if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

00:12:46.324 --> 00:12:48.228
coming out of your head.

00:12:55.948 --> 00:12:58.533
It is hot because you have not forgiven yourself

00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:00.510
or you have not forgiven others.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.011
Please bend your head.

00:13:10.152 --> 00:13:14.143
So now you forgive yourself and others.

00:13:21.855 --> 00:13:24.339
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:31.403
Again, once again, please put your head down

00:13:31.604 --> 00:13:33.444
and see with your right hand

00:13:33.645 --> 00:13:36.354
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:13:43.945 --> 00:13:47.781
If it is still hot then please forgive yourself and others.

00:13:56.562 --> 00:13:58.968
Now,

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:03.054
please put both your hands towards the sky like this.

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:08.130
And push back your head.

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.176
And ask one of these questions,

00:14:12.377 --> 00:14:14.622
one of these questions three times.

00:14:19.054 --> 00:14:20.924
You can call Me Mother

00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:23.593
or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:29.611
Now please ask in your heart,

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:33.364
“Mother, is this a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.674
Or, “Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

00:14:50.909 --> 00:14:54.773
Or, thirdly, “Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya?”

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:03.057
You can ask anyone of these one question three times.

00:15:06.729 --> 00:15:09.152
Now bring down your hands.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.795
Put both the hands towards Me. Please bring down your hands.

00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:23.384
If you are getting cool breeze

00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:27.692
on your fingertips or

00:15:28.954 --> 00:15:32.825
on the palm

00:15:33.026 --> 00:15:38.056
or out of your fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:55.418
Like flags.

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.168
Flags of peace and joy.

00:16:03.925 --> 00:16:05.850
Tremendous, I tell.

00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:10.791
May God bless you all.

00:16:12.588 --> 00:16:17.353
This is the beginning but you have to meditate, that’s very important.

00:16:21.634 --> 00:16:23.059
And grow into it.

00:16:24.424 --> 00:16:26.494
You don’t have to pay for it.

00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:29.744
It’s a living process.

00:16:31.127 --> 00:16:33.668
And you can not pay for any living process.

00:16:36.832 --> 00:16:38.113
Don’t doubt yourself.

00:16:42.742 --> 00:16:45.386
Thank you. May God bless you.

00:16:47.109 --> 00:16:48.436
Now they can sing.
