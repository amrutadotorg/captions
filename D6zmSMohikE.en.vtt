00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:13.660
So the value (of things) is not money

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.020
this one should understand.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.860
What is the value of the thing?

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.503
You want to give something to others,

00:00:26.703 --> 00:00:32.900
then the feelings you have in your heart is the value,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.940
and that value is the real Lakshmi.

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:45.483
When you are, say, building a house,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.780
the plans you make and things you do,

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:55.256
what is the idea behind

00:00:55.456 --> 00:01:01.411
and what you are trying to express through that house

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:04.971
is the value of that house.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.860
Once you understand that you have to buy,

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:18.340
with this Lakshmi, or you have to use this Lakshmi

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.120
for certain value, and not for showing off or for money.

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:33.838
This superficialness that we have about money

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:38.778
itself is like an ordinary glass,

00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:44.507
but if you put behind the glass the mercury,

00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:48.107
you can see the value.

00:01:49.203 --> 00:01:56.443
So when you start buying something, what is the purpose,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.667
why are you buying it

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:01.827
this will determine the value.

00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:06.253
Like, last time I came to Portugal

00:02:06.453 --> 00:02:11.494
and I said, "This year we'll go and buy some Terracotta"

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:13.846
but they are very expensive.

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:17.206
I said, "This is the price",

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.460
but I wanted to buy Terracotta from Portugal,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.875
because it's very rich in that.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:29.394
So we went to one factory, and the factory was quite far out,

00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:31.605
none of them could find out, but I told them,

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:34.551
"It's here only just go and see."

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:38.635
And then we bought the Terracotta.

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:42.081
But on our way I told,

00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:46.065
"Stop, stop here, stop."

00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.147
So they stopped, there was a shop.

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:54.248
I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis in India

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.450
and also for some people in Cabella.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.706
And that shop had such beautiful cottons.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.260
They were Sahaja Yogis from here who saw it

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.171
such beautiful clothes and I bought lot of it

00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:17.571
I said, "Thank God the problem presents are finished now for India."

00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:21.587
So joy-giving it was, everybody was surprised

00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:25.531
why, suddenly in a place where never had been Mother there,

00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:29.051
suddenly She finds them.

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:35.291
It has a value, because I wanted to buy something for Indians

00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:38.051
to be given as present.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.035
So if your Lakshmi is, say, this much,

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:49.061
once you add to it value it becomes so big.

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:56.793
The sign of a person who is Lakshmipathi is this

00:03:56.993 --> 00:04:02.387
he should have a house like the lotus in the hands

00:04:02.587 --> 00:04:05.899
of the Goddess,

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.578
he should protect people who are depending on him,

00:04:10.778 --> 00:04:15.362
and from the left hand he should give.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.494
This is the image of the Lakshmi.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.300
This is what the Lakshmi is within you,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.380
if you have these four things things in balance,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.420
without conditioning, without ego,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.670
then you are a Sahaja Yogi

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:38.646
Otherwise you are not.

00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:44.792
On a Diwali day we have to promise ourselves

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:50.660
that whatever we are going to get now as Lakshmi principle

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.003
or as a Lakshmi's prasad

00:04:54.203 --> 00:05:01.843
should be used in getting thing which has value.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.187
And thus you will learn that you have used your Lakshmi very well,

00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:18.052
and with that your Mahalakshmi principle becomes very strong.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.820
Will become very strong by which you'll ascend very fast.
