00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:05.642
Talk to Sahaja Yogis. Cairo (Egypt), 29 October 1996.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.410
Egypt has a lot to do with you people,

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:19.522
when you got away, in the East, from the time of Moses, isn’t it?

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:22.410
So, I am very happy that you could all come here

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:26.920
and visit this ancient place and see for yourself.

00:00:32.622 --> 00:00:37.777
We have to fight against all this nonsense that is going on

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.817
to make the country weak.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.388
This is how any country will be weak

00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:46.106
if you divide the country.

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:49.848
All these divisive methods make the country weak.

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:54.729
When you want to join them together,

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:57.767
then only the strength will come.

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.778
But if you want to divide the country,

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:04.454
these divisive methods are of no use.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:11.287
There should be methods of how to unite,

00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:13.949
how to bring them together.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.669
But I think, without Realisation, it is not possible.

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:18.907
I have reached the conclusion.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.179
You see, because mentally what can you decide?

00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:25.468
Now they will think of Hitler,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.273
[unclear] that is there,
they’ll punish them [unsure and unclear].

00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:36.821
But, whatever it is, Israelis can do a lot now.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:40.317
At least, they could get after Swiss bank.

00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:44.935
Don’t you think?

00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:47.841
They should put the attention to the Swiss bank.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:49.748
Why not?

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:53.355
There is one fellow who has started it in America.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.896
His name is Guy Anatole [unsure],

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.568
who has bought from the-

00:01:59.593 --> 00:02:03.691
he is an Italian and not a Catholic.

00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:11.829
And he is being supported by the Jews of New York,

00:02:11.837 --> 00:02:14.528
who are very powerful,

00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:18.373
that they want to know about Swiss bank.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.874
That would be the best to come with that precisely.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:30.243
That would be the best that they find out about the Swiss bank.

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.185
But it should be done in a very proper manner, I think.

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:36.734
First, what you should find out.

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:40.793
Because they have come to know that all their secret numbers

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:46.602
are in the bank itself, kept in safes.

00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:51.321
So, Interpol should take them,

00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.102
stop all the banks and search out their names.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.691
And whatever money is owned by others,

00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:08.173
they do not have any money!
They are Masonic people, horrible!

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.764
And also, they are joined with Catholic Church.

00:03:13.697 --> 00:03:15.697
Another is Catholic Church,

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.934
who have been so nasty with Jews as you know very well.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.154
There are all criminals joined together,

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:31.372
absolutely criminals.

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:35.511
Now I am in Italy, I know what it is.

00:03:35.773 --> 00:03:39.078
All kinds of criminality.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.245
From India, they took away money, from us by force.

00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:51.909
And that money was taken to Vatican, was given as a

00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:56.039
donation to Vatican: after all, Vatican is God’s thing, yes?

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.059
So, it went to Vatican.

00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:02.260
Then Vatican converted it to gold bars.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.766
Some of them believe in gold bars, not in money.

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:10.039
So, it was all converted, was taken to Torino,

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:15.410
where the house of our Prime Minister’s wife is.

00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:19.433
Rajiv Gandhi’s wife, Sonia [Italian origin].

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:24.706
And then that they took that to a bank in Switzerland.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.479
Somebody saw it.

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:30.910
And those gold bars were put in a particular bank.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.811
And we are poor people in India.

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.486
This is the trouble.

00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:45.696
Now this is only a wee bit of one [bogus? Unclear 4:46].

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:53.408
In our country, all politicians, Prime Ministers
–except for Lal Bahadur Shastri –

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:57.214
all are absolutely corrupt.

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:02.313
One by one, they are also going to leave, as in Italy.

00:05:02.687 --> 00:05:06.845
Since I have been in Italy, [they leave the country].

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:13.499
Now when I was in India, this thing started.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.831
Just imagine!

00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.999
Unashamed!

00:05:20.122 --> 00:05:24.005
But if there is no bottomless pit of Swiss bank,

00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:28.889
then where will they send the money? You see.

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:34.905
You must write to the Jews, in America,

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:37.448
what they are doing.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:43.756
In Brazil, the Supreme Court President

00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.489
and the Law Minister they met me.

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:48.342
And they told me that

00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:51.272
there cannot be any law as long as America

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.989
and the Swiss Bank are one.

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:55.737
I said, “Why?”

00:05:55.762 --> 00:06:00.846
He said, “They impeached  one president, impeached”.

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:03.613
One president in Brazil, you know that.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.316
He is now a highly paid professor in Harvard University.

00:06:14.761 --> 00:06:20.080
Jews can do a lot if they take sense into their heads, that is the point.

00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:23.768
Instead of that, what are they fighting?

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:30.408
Jews should manage the Swiss bank.

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.887
Imagine these people,

00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:44.391
they melted the teeth of the people who died,

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:47.419
made them into gold bars.

00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:51.215
And who carried them was this Red Cross.

00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:55.118
Can you imagine this Red Cross?

00:06:55.193 --> 00:06:59.288
I mean, if you ever happen to find my lecture,

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:01.187
when in Basel,

00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:05.812
I gave left and right to this Swiss bank,

00:07:05.837 --> 00:07:07.924
especially to this Red Cross.

00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:10.976
You must read that lecture,

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:14.701
a very powerful attack against the Swiss bank.

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:16.911
Since then, they are after us.

00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:21.423
Nobody should say, you know, whatever they are doing.

00:07:26.222 --> 00:07:28.504
I am not afraid of anyone,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.678
and you should not be afraid of anyone.

00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:33.198
After all, what can they do to us?

00:07:37.044 --> 00:07:43.596
But I think you all should all write to the Jews in New York

00:07:44.702 --> 00:07:47.349
that, “What are you doing? You have to do this”.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.071
And to, also, to your Prime Minister.

00:07:50.655 --> 00:07:52.547
Why are they after the Palestinians?

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.133
What are they going to get out of them?

00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:57.079
Get after the Swiss bank!

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.863
Sahaja Yogi: This will solve the problems quickly.

00:08:04.452 --> 00:08:07.997
Sahaja Yogi: This will solve the problems between Arabs and Israel.

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:09.176
Pardon, this will solve?

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.110
Your idea,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.837
will solve the problem between Arabs and Israel very quickly.

00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:17.416
When they go to the Swiss Bank.

00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:19.311
Swiss Bank.

00:08:19.352 --> 00:08:21.777
Openly you won’t be surprised.

00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:27.947
I went down for a lecture in this conference,

00:08:27.972 --> 00:08:30.554
the women’s conference in China,So, a big paragraph on the Swiss bank, I spoke clearly.

00:08:30.578 --> 00:08:33.070
I was one of the main speakers.

00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:41.672
So, a big paragraph on the Swiss bank, I spoke clearly.

00:08:42.407 --> 00:08:46.000
Then afterwards, after the lectures were over,

00:08:46.523 --> 00:08:50.553
so many ladies gave their responses.

00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:55.858
They said, “The person who has really meet the point is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:59.235
Because Swiss bank is our enemy”.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.821
They were from all over the world, they had gathered there,

00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:05.807
they said, “Because of Swiss bank, we are poor”.

00:09:06.258 --> 00:09:09.859
Why not people see this point?

00:09:12.212 --> 00:09:16.755
Bottomless pit, all our money is going down there.

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:25.602
But you Jews can do this work,
I tell you as Jews,

00:09:25.842 --> 00:09:28.076
they are no more Jews, I know, but still.

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:31.404
Still,

00:09:32.198 --> 00:09:34.139
whatever it is.

00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:42.112
And another great point is that

00:09:42.386 --> 00:09:44.469
they are Masonic people,

00:09:44.698 --> 00:09:47.171
this Swiss bank, they are all Masonic.

00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:49.275
So, they are secretive.

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:53.118
Did you read that book ‘In the Name of God” in English language?

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.346
From Yallop David. You read it.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.523
You will know all the tricks of these people.

00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:05.608
This Swiss bank has got Masonic people.

00:10:06.454 --> 00:10:11.129
And this Masonic law was also part and parcel

00:10:11.142 --> 00:10:15.655
of their Catholic church, built in it.

00:10:17.294 --> 00:10:22.545
And the sentries that are there, all the sentries,

00:10:22.557 --> 00:10:27.691
are all Swiss in the Vatican.

00:10:30.913 --> 00:10:33.585
Now this Vatican

00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:39.574
counterfeited 9 billion dollars, counterfeited.

00:10:40.086 --> 00:10:41.693
Do you know what means counterfeited?

00:10:41.718 --> 00:10:45.864
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, fake, fake the money.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.164
Sahaja Yogi: Fake money.
Shri Mataji: Fake, fake, fake.

00:10:49.574 --> 00:10:53.338
And gave it to their own customers in their own bank.

00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:58.281
Up to such a point, that book says,

00:10:58.306 --> 00:11:02.249
that the last Pope was a very good man and he was killed within

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.875
within 35 days, by this Pope.

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:11.018
That is what it says, I don’t know.

00:11:11.022 --> 00:11:12.605
I met Yallop [the author of the book]

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.760
and he said, “I have all the documents with me.

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:18.077
So, they can’t charge me”.

00:11:26.984 --> 00:11:31.098
Now the only point is that

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:36.643
these Christians started saying as a view other religion is stupid,

00:11:36.668 --> 00:11:41.701
they started saying that Christ was crucified

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:46.188
by the Jews.

00:11:46.213 --> 00:11:51.973
Now tell me any country can the multitude crucify a person?

00:11:52.764 --> 00:11:57.127
There should be someone body who is a magistrate or something isn’t it?

00:11:57.152 --> 00:12:00.758
How can a thousand people say, “All right, kill him. Now kill him!”

00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:04.920
And then they got after all the Jews, these Christians, you know,

00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:08.166
and troubled them and tortured them.

00:12:09.681 --> 00:12:12.651
So now the Jews are sitting on their head.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.252
And Freud, you know, wanted to make

00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:19.651
Christians really anti-God.

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:23.308
So, he gave his own tips.
You can see he was a Jew.

00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:32.968
That is how the Western culture became so corrupt.

00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:36.647
That is how the fundamentalists became so strong,

00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.208
it is a vicious circle.

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:48.198
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t say, “Don’t do this don’t do that”.

00:12:48.223 --> 00:12:51.015
We just don’t do it if it’s a wrong thing.

00:12:51.343 --> 00:12:53.810
Automatically isn’t it.

00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:57.497
I mean, I don’t say, I never said, “You don’t take drugs”. Did I?

00:12:58.191 --> 00:13:01.561
Never, you just didn’t do it.

00:13:06.064 --> 00:13:09.320
So big responsibility on the Jews, I tell you, to

00:13:10.747 --> 00:13:13.280
get out of this Swiss Bank.

00:13:13.702 --> 00:13:15.603
They are the best!

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.580
Because their forefathers who were gassed –

00:13:19.622 --> 00:13:21.910
they took out teeth,

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:24.291
I mean it is such a horrible thing to do,

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:26.878
and made them into gold bars,

00:13:27.594 --> 00:13:30.855
3000 gold bars.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.380
Shameful people.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.649
Also in, what happened in Rome?

00:13:43.664 --> 00:13:45.686
They didn’t allow what?

00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:49.000
They didn’t give protection to all the Jews, I think.

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:50.352
Guido: Ah, the Pope.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.265
Yes, actually, they never protest.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.798
They never say anything against.

00:13:57.823 --> 00:14:01.257
And on the contrary, they were protecting the Nazis.

00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:04.877
So, they were hosting the Nazis in the churches

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.974
and then they were helping the Nazis to go in South American.

00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:14.148
And so many war criminals,

00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:21.027
they took away in the submarines to Argentina.

00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:24.951
I have seen, in Argentina,
I have seen them there.

00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:27.418
You see, they have taught them all German things

00:14:27.443 --> 00:14:30.496
of the goose step and all that.

00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:35.122
And when Argentina was attacked, because of that island,

00:14:35.733 --> 00:14:40.471
I was just thinking that it should be lost to them.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.327
Because this German thing has to go away.

00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:47.238
They are building up huge big things there, ‘baap re’ [Hindi; express astonishment]

00:14:47.263 --> 00:14:52.092
I don’t know how many miles together

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:54.594
for a third world war,

00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:59.795
these Germans, these war criminals. They are still hiding there,

00:15:01.078 --> 00:15:02.972
they are still in Argentina,

00:15:03.142 --> 00:15:04.582
Sahaja Yogi: Many.

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:10.583
So, they took all the war criminals with them, in the submarines.

00:15:12.234 --> 00:15:14.133
What do you say to that?

00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:21.806
So, for Sahaja Yogis, it is important to write to all the Jews:

00:15:22.601 --> 00:15:23.890
what are you doing about it?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.317
Your younger people will like to know.

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:34.247
I will get you the addresses of all the Jews in New York.

00:15:35.572 --> 00:15:38.096
I have already sent Linda [Taylor] there, to find out.

00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:52.819
Divert their attention from Palestine to this, you see.

00:15:52.998 --> 00:15:54.722
It should be diverted

00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:57.853
to something constructive.

00:15:58.176 --> 00:16:00.195
What is the use even if there’s a Palestine,

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.529
what will they get? What will they get?

00:16:03.575 --> 00:16:06.285
Little land more. So, what will happen?

00:16:07.012 --> 00:16:08.762
What is such an achievement?

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.844
I just don’t understand.

00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:33.441
Israelis must now realise that war has to be stopped.

00:16:34.068 --> 00:16:36.487
They have suffered a lot with war.

00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:39.503
No more wars, no more wars.

00:16:40.317 --> 00:16:43.214
At any cost, we don’t want war.

00:16:45.332 --> 00:16:47.821
But get after this.

00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:51.677
You see, as far as peace is concerned, I will manage, I think.

00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:56.887
But poverty, only this Swiss bank has to go.

00:16:57.816 --> 00:17:02.538
Only two problems we have: one is violence, another is poverty.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.504
Violence part, I can look after.

00:17:04.763 --> 00:17:06.718
I think I can manage.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:10.992
But this Swiss Bank…

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.886
[Cut in the video]

00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:22.468
Italian magistrates went there, I was told, to find something.

00:17:22.502 --> 00:17:24.912
They couldn’t find because there are numbers.

00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:30.379
But now they find out, the numbers only are kept in a vault.

00:17:31.777 --> 00:17:34.182
So, they should break the vault.

00:17:34.504 --> 00:17:37.860
Instead of fighting the Palestinian people,

00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:41.658
they should fight the bank,

00:17:43.048 --> 00:17:46.037
Swiss bank, you see?

00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:48.821
That’s important.

00:17:53.884 --> 00:17:56.985
Not for money, but on principle,

00:17:57.505 --> 00:18:00.457
they can save all the world by that.

00:18:03.848 --> 00:18:07.240
They are already doing it but if you people write, you see,

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:10.640
they will feel more sort of energy about it.

00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:16.595
Since I have said it, in China,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.134
it has started working out, I mean.

00:18:19.287 --> 00:18:21.335
Did I take out my socks? It’s there.

00:18:21.341 --> 00:18:23.880
I don’t know if there are socks.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.567
Let’s put on it

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.758
You see, so,  Sahaja Yogis have some jobs,

00:18:30.783 --> 00:18:32.050
and that is a job.

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:37.172
I have asked Linda  and she will be sending you the addresses.

00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:40.694
And you all should write combined.

00:18:47.837 --> 00:18:51.939
‘What will you do with the land added to you?

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.439
What will you do?

00:18:56.512 --> 00:18:58.256
What will you achieve?

00:19:08.832 --> 00:19:13.508
Now this war in say,

00:19:17.162 --> 00:19:19.668
going on, another war,

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:24.335
which America is trying with Saddam Hussein.

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:28.875
If these people, Americans,

00:19:29.024 --> 00:19:34.005
are so very sympathetic, say for Kurdish,

00:19:34.817 --> 00:19:36.350
so why don’t they take all of them?

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:39.806
They are not going back to America.

00:19:40.068 --> 00:19:44.353
In the lower part of America, in the south part, it is all vacant.

00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:46.242
Nobody lives there,

00:19:46.323 --> 00:19:48.467
these are few Kurdish, take them there.

00:19:48.494 --> 00:19:52.304
But there are very troublesome people, you don’t know, I have had reports on them.

00:19:52.854 --> 00:19:56.198
They are not very sensible, they are not only rustic,

00:19:56.223 --> 00:19:59.414
but they are like Afghanis, you know, fighting cocks.

00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:02.321
Very big fighters.

00:20:02.794 --> 00:20:06.250
You cannot talk to them, they are not sensible at all!

00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:09.632
They are like nomads, nomadic people.

00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:12.176
They are nomads I think.

00:20:13.203 --> 00:20:15.496
But gypsies are better than this.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:21.551
And these Kurdish, to protect them

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:27.460
they are throwing these things for Saddam Hussein.

00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:30.532
What is it after all?

00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:35.801
Take these Kurdish and put them in America, somewhere.

00:20:35.826 --> 00:20:37.372
They will be all right.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.272
Lot of room there.

00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:43.703
Now you are Italian.

00:20:44.598 --> 00:20:49.277
Italy has so much of land which is just wasted land.

00:20:49.385 --> 00:20:53.761
So much land in such a small country and such a small population.

00:20:54.381 --> 00:20:57.155
But they don’t want any immigrants to come in.

00:20:58.247 --> 00:21:01.161
They brought some snakes, 3000 snakes,

00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:03.756
and put them in the jungle we had,

00:21:03.923 --> 00:21:09.692
because somebody told them, For ecological balance, you must have  some snakes.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.826
.In the winter, all the snakes died.

00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:21.827
This solution did not work out,

00:21:21.966 --> 00:21:24.758
I mean, in England, you will be amazed,

00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:31.693
half of the England is just vacant,

00:21:33.602 --> 00:21:38.714
half of the England has very few population.

00:21:42.256 --> 00:21:43.256
Isn’t it?

00:21:45.284 --> 00:21:48.566
So why not put some of the people there?

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.440
Then Australia, I am surprised,

00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:55.132
Australia is a barren land

00:21:56.233 --> 00:21:59.395
and there now, they don’t want any immigrants there.

00:21:59.734 --> 00:22:02.871
I mean this world belongs to the whole world.

00:22:03.467 --> 00:22:07.073
And if there are more people somewhere, why not have some of them there?

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.126
So now people are protesting, Chinese are protesting

00:22:10.352 --> 00:22:15.283
about these immigration laws in Australia.

00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:23.681
Australia is so big and so difficult:

00:22:24.588 --> 00:22:28.363
you have to go from one place to another in the night,

00:22:28.388 --> 00:22:30.897
you don’t find even one single hotel.

00:22:32.574 --> 00:22:37.993
It is only there, Koala bears are prospering.

00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:40.974
Koala bears are prospering; too many koala bears.

00:22:42.032 --> 00:22:44.460
Crocodiles are prospering.

00:22:45.527 --> 00:22:48.100
Guido: Now rabbits.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Guido: Rabbits.

00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:49.713
Rabbits are prospering.

00:22:50.624 --> 00:22:52.090
They are so much.

00:22:52.108 --> 00:22:56.209
They have so much of lambs that they are killing lambs.

00:22:57.015 --> 00:23:01.551
But they will not have, one of  many surprising things,

00:23:01.576 --> 00:23:04.274
have human beings there.

00:23:09.394 --> 00:23:13.842
After some time, you may just find rabbits living there.

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:21.970
Australia, the growth of white skinned people is minus.

00:23:22.231 --> 00:23:24.651
America is double minus,

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.926
Europe: minus. So, all the white skin is disappearing.

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:48.681
They don’t think from a global point of view.

00:23:49.642 --> 00:23:52.820
The whole thing is limited, isn’t it?

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.559
They never think what we are doing,

00:23:55.576 --> 00:23:58.903
what good it will do to the whole world. Never.

00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:09.555
You must, somehow or another,

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.244
get some Palestinians in Sahaja Yoga also.

00:24:13.482 --> 00:24:14.543
Sahaja Yogi: We have one.

00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:15.765
You have?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:17.229
Really? Who?

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.480
Sahaja Yogi: He is now, actually, in Israel.

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:20.680
I didn’t see any.

00:24:20.802 --> 00:24:23.679
Sahaja Yogi: He is from Germany.

00:24:23.933 --> 00:24:24.577
Really?

00:24:24.594 --> 00:24:27.813
Sahaja Yogi: But he is Palestinian.

00:24:27.931 --> 00:24:28.931
One person.

00:24:29.476 --> 00:24:31.289
Sahaja Yogi: It’s a start.

00:24:31.683 --> 00:24:33.556
Now get more. That’s the solution.

00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:43.309
Djamel: We have no Sunnis Shri Mataji.

00:24:43.675 --> 00:24:45.810
We have no Sunnis in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:45.823 --> 00:24:46.490
Haa?

00:24:46.497 --> 00:24:50.296
Djamel: Virtually, we have no Sunnis in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.153
No what?

00:24:51.178 --> 00:24:52.083
Sahaja Yogi: Sunni, Sunni.

00:24:52.108 --> 00:24:54.250
Djamel: Sunnis. We have Shias.

00:24:54.272 --> 00:24:55.172
In Palestine?

00:24:55.185 --> 00:24:56.752
Djamel: No, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:56.779 --> 00:24:58.892
Within Sahaja Yoga, we have had any Sunnis

00:24:58.917 --> 00:25:01.311
who have come, naturally joined Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:01.331 --> 00:25:03.115
But you are a Sunni.

00:25:03.173 --> 00:25:05.520
You are a Sunni.

00:25:05.534 --> 00:25:06.974
Sunni now started.

00:25:06.978 --> 00:25:10.084
You are a Sunni. Another Sunni I know of is –

00:25:10.104 --> 00:25:11.404
Alganesh: You are a Sunni.

00:25:11.448 --> 00:25:15.598
Amzad. Amzad is a Sunni,

00:25:15.638 --> 00:25:17.628
not a Shia.

00:25:17.642 --> 00:25:21.141
Zafar is a Sunni.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.491
Only Iranians are not.

00:25:26.897 --> 00:25:27.969
Majid.

00:25:27.994 --> 00:25:29.347
Djamel: Yes.

00:25:29.374 --> 00:25:32.568
Majid is sufficient for all the Sunnis and all the rest!

00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:37.719
Djamel: Actually, they are two conditions: now you have to be Sunni and Arab, you see, it is a very difficult combination.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.900
Alganesh: That is too much.

00:25:41.493 --> 00:25:46.234
Djamel: No, no, you have to be Sunni and Arab. Now it is very easy to get a Berber.

00:25:46.256 --> 00:25:48.507
Berbers are easy to get into Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:48.532 --> 00:25:52.214
because they are not so conditioned.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.782
Like Ait-chalal, he is a Berber.

00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:56.359
Ait-chalal is Berber?

00:25:56.386 --> 00:25:57.632
Djamel: He is Berber, he is not Arab.

00:25:57.646 --> 00:25:58.578
Alganesh: He is a Sunni.

00:25:58.603 --> 00:26:00.345
Djamel: He is a Sunni but Berber.

00:26:01.353 --> 00:26:03.220
Shri Mataji: You are Berber?

00:26:04.346 --> 00:26:08.774
Djamel: [Unclear] I am supposed to be Arab in Algeria.

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:11.595
Djamel: No, no, we are not Bedouin. We are actually Arabs.

00:26:11.627 --> 00:26:14.970
So now it is your responsibility to get some Arabs in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:14.995 --> 00:26:19.542
Djamel: It is very difficult to get this combination of Arab and Sunni, very difficult.

00:26:19.567 --> 00:26:23.738
And they are much more fundamentalists, in general,

00:26:23.763 --> 00:26:25.100
than Shias or-

00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:27.253
You mean Arabs are more fundamentalist?

00:26:27.262 --> 00:26:32.456
Sahaja Yogi: No, I think, I read, I was in Bahrain.

00:26:32.483 --> 00:26:35.954
I was in Bahrain, in Bahrain before.

00:26:35.979 --> 00:26:38.998
And I met – I am Sunni.

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:42.277
And I met many Shiites. Shia.

00:26:42.744 --> 00:26:45.347
Sahaja Yogi: Yes from Iran and from Bahrain.

00:26:45.392 --> 00:26:49.628
Sunnis are moderate, moderate.

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:51.452
Shiites are very hard.

00:26:51.478 --> 00:26:52.992
Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:55.453
Yes and I read their books.

00:26:55.478 --> 00:26:58.479
I read many books on Shiite.

00:26:58.497 --> 00:27:03.131
There is no a go-between, no middle way.

00:27:03.165 --> 00:27:05.388
Only right or left.

00:27:05.448 --> 00:27:07.428
The Shiite?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:27:07.437 --> 00:27:10.362
But here in Egypt, we are Sunni.

00:27:10.387 --> 00:27:15.554
But we respect – Sunnis respect Imams of Shiite.

00:27:16.065 --> 00:27:18.508
Shri Mataji: Imams.
Sahaja Yogi: Of Shiite.

00:27:18.546 --> 00:27:20.251
Shri Mataji: Imams.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:26.780
But Shiite does not respect ‘chef’ of Sunni.

00:27:27.324 --> 00:27:29.789
You know Sayyidna Husayn.

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:32.274
Al-Husayn Sahib Mosque.

00:27:32.301 --> 00:27:33.687
Mosque of Al-Husayn

00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:37.742
Alganesh: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: I am going to take some friends to see it.

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:41.987
It is Shiite. One of the grandfathers-

00:27:42.012 --> 00:27:43.220
Shri Mataji: Hussain?

00:27:43.228 --> 00:27:44.266
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:47.666
I know, I have been there.  I have been to all these now.

00:27:47.697 --> 00:27:50.845
And where is Karbala

00:27:50.988 --> 00:27:53.354
Sahaja Yogi: Exactly. Yes.

00:27:53.361 --> 00:27:58.683
He [Al-Hussein ibn Ali] was decapitated, they hated the Karbala.

00:27:58.708 --> 00:28:04.824
And he asked God to send punishment and torment

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:08.758
on  the people in Karbala. Because they cheated him.

00:28:08.782 --> 00:28:13.877
So, Shiite, I think Shiite are very hard from inside.

00:28:13.902 --> 00:28:16.086
And you cannot talk to them. I tried but.

00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:19.006
Yes but I met some Shias. You would be amazed.

00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:25.067
The head of the Shias of the whole of Europe has taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:25.922 --> 00:28:26.635
Sahaja Yogi: Really?

00:28:26.648 --> 00:28:28.001
Djamel: Ayatollah Rohani.

00:28:29.021 --> 00:28:30.807
Ayatollah Rohani.

00:28:30.832 --> 00:28:32.337
Sahaja Yogi: Ah, yes, yes, yes.

00:28:32.365 --> 00:28:34.439
And another one. What was his name?

00:28:34.466 --> 00:28:38.307
He is the assistant who was Prime Minister of-

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.387
Djamel: Ah, Beni Sadr.

00:28:39.412 --> 00:28:42.802
Sahaja Yogi: Ah, Beni Sadr, former Prime Minister.
Djamel: The former president.

00:28:42.827 --> 00:28:44.603
They have taken to Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:44.645 --> 00:28:46.982
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Great, yes.

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:52.997
So now, you see, these theories also trample down within, when it is Sahaja Yoga, I have seen it.

00:28:53.022 --> 00:28:58.517
Because this gentleman came to my program to get Self-realisation,

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:00.949
can you imagine this man?

00:29:00.974 --> 00:29:02.315
Sahaja Yogi: No, no. I can’t

00:29:02.323 --> 00:29:04.427
Shri Mataji: Have you met him?
Sahaja Yogi: No.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:11.729
This Ayatollah Rohani, his brother was elected instead of this-

00:29:11.754 --> 00:29:14.264
what’s his name?
Djamel: Ah, yes. His brother.

00:29:16.979 --> 00:29:18.000
In his place.

00:29:18.028 --> 00:29:22.972
Djamel: His brother was supposed to become the new-

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.480
Who is now under arrest, home arrest, house arrest.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.622
Djamel: The Ayatollah of Ayatollahs. There is a name for it.

00:29:29.649 --> 00:29:32.038
And they took somebody else instead. I don’t know.

00:29:32.063 --> 00:29:34.593
Yes, Khomeini or someone like that.

00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:39.724
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I know. Hassan Beni-sadr was, left Iran

00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:49.222
after the Ayatollah Khomeini controlled, ruling in Iran.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.242
I know this history.

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:53.504
Djamel: No, there was another story later.

00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:57.227
Recently the Ayatollah of- there is a rank

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.095
which is the Ayatollah of Ayatollahs. He died.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.713
And he was supposed to be replaced by the brother of Rohani.

00:30:03.738 --> 00:30:08.532
And of course, they put him under arm
[cut in the video 30:07 to 30:09]

00:30:08.543 --> 00:30:10.046
… To Russia and all that.

00:30:10.072 --> 00:30:14.140
And he has tremendous respect for me.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:22.775
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I saw him, you know, Mother to mark the death of Hussain.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.665
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:29.488
They cut with the long swords, hit their heads,

00:30:29.513 --> 00:30:31.886
Shri Mataji: What’s that?
Sahaja Yogi: And yes, Shiite.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:37.429
And they catch ‘Resuls’? You know ‘Resuls’ ? They hit their backs.

00:30:37.454 --> 00:30:38.867
Shri Mataji: Ah. We have that, we have that in India.

00:30:38.892 --> 00:30:40.255
Sahaja Yogi: Blood, blood everywhere,

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.271
[UNCLEAR] how long way?

00:30:42.275 --> 00:30:45.408
Yes, yes. Ibn Hussein [unclear] Hassan, we were not there. They are repenting.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.324
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, exactly.

00:30:47.332 --> 00:30:51.313
But out of that only, these people came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:51.487 --> 00:30:55.050
They gave up all the nonsense.

00:30:55.974 --> 00:31:00.002
You see, they gave up all the nonsense, and they have become great Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:04.598
We have some very great Sahaja Yogis, you would be happy to meet them.

00:31:05.087 --> 00:31:06.535
Especially Majid.

00:31:08.846 --> 00:31:13.726
He is the last word. Very great Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:15.965 --> 00:31:20.187
And the one you have in Rome?
Guido: Ali.

00:31:21.697 --> 00:31:24.737
So this is stupidity. This was not told by Ali,

00:31:24.748 --> 00:31:27.884
Hasrat Ali, that you should hit yourself for anything.

00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:31.841
This is only ritualism they have done it, to make a big show,

00:31:31.866 --> 00:31:34.561
that’s all. It has no meaning.

00:31:34.586 --> 00:31:37.565
But these people have become Sahaja Yogis now.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.348
They have given up that nonsense.

00:31:45.156 --> 00:31:48.883
In Sahaja Yoga, you will discover who was Hazrat Ali,

00:31:49.381 --> 00:31:51.448
who was Prophet Mohammed,

00:31:52.134 --> 00:31:55.198
who was Fatima, you will know.

00:31:56.004 --> 00:31:58.417
They are not like somebody coming up,

00:31:58.442 --> 00:32:00.903
they are ancient.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.104
And who they were, you will discover.

00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:08.936
In our ancient books, it is written about Prophet Mohammed:

00:32:10.507 --> 00:32:13.286
Mohammed: Maha Meda.

00:32:13.302 --> 00:32:15.141
This is the Meda, this place [Ekadesha rudras].

00:32:15.182 --> 00:32:18.776
‘Maha’ means the great. That part he resides here[above Agnya].

00:32:20.569 --> 00:32:25.307
We believe that he is the incarnation of the Primordial Master.

00:32:27.917 --> 00:32:32.389
See the Islamic version,

00:32:32.414 --> 00:32:35.504
he, poor fellow, has no place at all!

00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:38.437
They don’t even think he was Divine.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.982
Was he like a radio, or what?
Everything came to his mind.

00:32:43.016 --> 00:32:45.556
Can it come like that?

00:32:45.581 --> 00:32:49.399
This was all done by, I think, this fellow ‘Moawiya’.

00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:52.245
Sahaja Yogi: ‘Muawiya’.
Shri Mataji: He did it.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.085
Djamel: ‘Muawiya’. Wazalli [unsure].

00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:55.715
He did all this harm to him.

00:32:55.736 --> 00:32:58.489
And another was Uthman, I think, I don’t know how

00:32:58.504 --> 00:33:00.186
Djamel: Uthman, yes.

00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:02.128
Sahaja Yogi: They killed him.

00:33:02.153 --> 00:33:04.536
We called him ‘Hawalish’,

00:33:04.575 --> 00:33:07.897
he’s ‘hawalish’, like rebels now.

00:33:07.922 --> 00:33:09.192
Alganesh: He was a rebel.

00:33:09.225 --> 00:33:13.389
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: Like rebels, ‘hawals’ mean rebels.

00:33:13.414 --> 00:33:17.977
They entered on Uthman in [unclear].

00:33:17.979 --> 00:33:22.110
His wife was sitting beside him, they wanted to kill him.

00:33:22.135 --> 00:33:25.120
So, his wife tried to protect him

00:33:25.145 --> 00:33:28.968
by exposing her hair, her head.

00:33:28.993 --> 00:33:34.460
It was a disgrace at the time, any man

00:33:34.485 --> 00:33:36.752
enters at the woman

00:33:36.777 --> 00:33:40.087
and she exposes her hair at this stage

00:33:40.108 --> 00:33:42.746
he should quickly do like this.

00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.341
They refused to leave,

00:33:45.366 --> 00:33:49.053
she exposed her face to make them ashamed

00:33:49.078 --> 00:33:50.713
and leave the room.

00:33:50.738 --> 00:33:51.957
Did you understand?

00:33:51.977 --> 00:33:54.237
As if I entered a room-
Shri Mataji: Yes, I understand.

00:33:54.244 --> 00:33:56.811
Sahaja Yogi: Yes sorry, as if I entered the room,

00:33:56.825 --> 00:33:58.837
and I saw a naked woman,

00:33:58.845 --> 00:34:02.318
I should quickly do like this? They refused.

00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:05.704
They refused to leave and

00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:10.168
raised their hand with the sword and they tried to protect Osman.

00:34:10.193 --> 00:34:14.246
So, they cut her finger, this finger, but they killed him.

00:34:14.887 --> 00:34:17.183
Shri Mataji: They killed him?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:24.778
All history is full of this nonsense.

00:34:25.085 --> 00:34:27.171
Sahaja Yogi: Then there was a war,

00:34:27.193 --> 00:34:32.109
a war between his followers and the [unclear].

00:34:32.116 --> 00:34:34.257
What do you think of this Muawiya fellow?

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.030
Sahaja Yogi: Muawiya Ibn Abi Sufyan?
Shri Mataji: Muawiya, yes.

00:34:38.055 --> 00:34:41.908
His mother ate the liver of the fifth Calipha.

00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:44.070
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes.

00:34:44.077 --> 00:34:50.305
But he is the founder of the Muawiya family and the ruling.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.881
My father told me all this,

00:34:54.902 --> 00:34:58.590
because he translated the Quran-ı Sherif into Hindi.

00:34:58.615 --> 00:35:02.580
My father was a great scholar of fourteen languages.

00:35:03.814 --> 00:35:07.823
He was a member of our parliament and

00:35:07.843 --> 00:35:10.307
a very well-known man.

00:35:10.714 --> 00:35:13.677
And he told me so many things that,

00:35:13.684 --> 00:35:16.658
what Islam was, is no more.

00:35:16.683 --> 00:35:18.529
Sahaja Yogi: Exactly, yes.

00:35:18.629 --> 00:35:20.952
‘Islam’ means to surrender,

00:35:22.972 --> 00:35:25.378
to surrender to Divine.

00:35:26.142 --> 00:35:28.701
Islam word means that.

00:35:29.785 --> 00:35:33.853
But everywhere!
Bible is changed so much!

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:37.194
Bible is so much changed, you can’t believe it.

00:35:37.503 --> 00:35:41.217
The things they have said, Christ has said something, they have said something else.

00:35:41.242 --> 00:35:45.563
Because I have Divine eyes, I can see what they have changed.

00:35:47.587 --> 00:35:51.585
The way they have interpreted everyone is deviated, I tell you,

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.256
human beings are such they can spoil everything.

00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:58.221
That’s their speciality.

00:35:58.246 --> 00:36:02.169
Say, you can go in a forest. It will be very clean, nice.

00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:05.428
One human being goes to live in a forest,

00:36:05.435 --> 00:36:07.776
you will know immediately what it is.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.778
That is what is in the religion.

00:36:09.798 --> 00:36:11.420
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. This is human beings.

00:36:11.445 --> 00:36:13.259
That’s everything they have done,

00:36:13.273 --> 00:36:15.382
ruined all the religions like this.

00:36:15.407 --> 00:36:18.462
And by ruining them, they are ruining the people also.

00:36:18.469 --> 00:36:23.060
And people believe – I really, sometimes I feel such pity.

00:36:23.085 --> 00:36:25.291
T for the faithful, you know.

00:36:25.298 --> 00:36:28.377
The way they pray, the way they do.

00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:32.906
Poor things, they have no connection with God. What are they praying?

00:36:32.931 --> 00:36:35.767
There should be the connection with God.

00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:38.510
Without the connection they are praying.

00:36:38.535 --> 00:36:40.356
What are they praying?

00:36:40.371 --> 00:36:42.064
To whom are they praying?

00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:44.394
Just think of it.

00:36:45.707 --> 00:36:51.024
You have no connection at all, and just praying morning till evening.

00:36:51.508 --> 00:36:56.168
There was one fellow, a Sheik in Maharashtra, [name unclear].

00:36:56.193 --> 00:36:59.696
He was a musician and a poet also.

00:36:59.721 --> 00:37:02.912
So, he told me that, “By doing the ‘namaz’,

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.732
both my knees broke.

00:37:06.832 --> 00:37:11.917
Then I took to these bhajans

00:37:11.942 --> 00:37:15.720
on going to Pandhapur

00:37:15.745 --> 00:37:19.362
with those things [Indian percussions], you see, playing this.

00:37:19.387 --> 00:37:22.432
So, I used to faint on the way.

00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.014
But Mother, then I came to you.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.246
In 5 minutes, you gave me Realisation”.

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:30.994
I said, “This is all due date

00:37:31.016 --> 00:37:34.168
in your sweetness and innocence.

00:37:34.193 --> 00:37:37.152
But I can’t do that to you anymore”.

00:37:37.167 --> 00:37:40.114
You see, then he’s a big Sahaja Yogi now.

00:37:40.136 --> 00:37:42.877
There are many like that, many.

00:37:43.775 --> 00:37:48.635
In India also, you see, there are so many false gurus.

00:37:48.656 --> 00:37:51.928
And even if there are real gurus, they are very hard.

00:37:51.955 --> 00:37:54.625
They haven’t got a mother’s side at all.

00:37:59.083 --> 00:38:01.818
One small story, I will tell you.

00:38:02.652 --> 00:38:08.239
There was one guru, one master, supposed to be very good.

00:38:11.893 --> 00:38:19.050
So, he was living on a big mountain near Kolhapur.

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:22.642
One doctor lady came to see me

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:26.584
and she said, “Mother I went to this guru and he told me, ‘You’re a fool.

00:38:26.609 --> 00:38:28.170
Why are you coming to me?

00:38:28.184 --> 00:38:30.740
There is somebody, Adi Shakti sitting there.

00:38:30.765 --> 00:38:32.755
So, why do you want to come to me?’

00:38:32.802 --> 00:38:37.186
So, I come to you, to bow to you”.

00:38:37.892 --> 00:38:41.858
So when I went to Kolhapur I said, “Let me go and see this fellow

00:38:41.883 --> 00:38:44.326
Gagangiri Maharaj”.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.580
He had lost his legs completely poor thing.

00:38:47.605 --> 00:38:49.643
Because he used to sit in the water.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.772
He felt the heat of the people so much,

00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:55.045
that he always sat in the water. He lost his feet completely.

00:38:56.302 --> 00:38:58.355
So this Gagangar,

00:38:58.383 --> 00:39:01.385
I had to climb quite a lot. So, the Sahaja Yogis started saying,

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.026
“Mother, you never go to any guru.

00:39:03.051 --> 00:39:04.241
Why do you want to go to him?”

00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:08.189
I said, “You see the vibrations

00:39:08.409 --> 00:39:11.273
and you will know what a guru means”.

00:39:11.298 --> 00:39:13.357
I went up to see this guru.

00:39:13.374 --> 00:39:16.589
It was raining, raining, raining very heavily.

00:39:16.623 --> 00:39:20.075
And this guru was sitting outside the cave.

00:39:20.952 --> 00:39:25.133
Very angry with the rain. Just imagine,

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.086
I went into his cave and sat down.

00:39:28.108 --> 00:39:31.474
So, this Guru Maraj came inside.

00:39:34.424 --> 00:39:37.345
He came- they brought him as he cannot walk.

00:39:37.358 --> 00:39:39.778
He goes on a tiger.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.637
He came and sat on his –

00:39:45.581 --> 00:39:49.177
you can call – a junkier [unsure] we call it, this small little thing.

00:39:50.511 --> 00:39:55.972
He said, “Why did you not allow me to stop the rain?

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.626
You wanted to take out my ego?”

00:40:01.314 --> 00:40:06.889
Because he was supposed to be able to stop the rain.

00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:10.941
That’s what they said, he can stop the rain, all right?

00:40:11.094 --> 00:40:14.033
So, “Why didn’t you allow me to stop the rain?”

00:40:14.217 --> 00:40:17.306
Because he knew what I was, that was one thing.

00:40:18.094 --> 00:40:23.448
So, I told him, “See, you are an aesthetic, you are a sanyasi

00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:26.196
and you have got a sari for me.

00:40:26.216 --> 00:40:29.891
And you know I won’t take anything from a sanyasi son,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.859
so I had to get drenched.

00:40:31.888 --> 00:40:34.507
If I was not drenched with water,

00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:37.569
how will I accept a sari from you?”

00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:40.186
Immediately, he melted.

00:40:40.693 --> 00:40:45.297
Absolutely! Then he started crying absolutely.

00:40:45.657 --> 00:40:48.801
And of course, he sat with me.

00:40:48.808 --> 00:40:51.469
But he was talking on another level,

00:40:51.494 --> 00:40:56.769
not on a human level, but other levels above, God’s centres, doesn’t matter.

00:40:57.783 --> 00:40:59.935
Then he said, “Now I have to tell you one thing.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.690
I cannot be of great use to you,

00:41:01.715 --> 00:41:04.591
but if somebody troubles you, send him over to me.

00:41:04.605 --> 00:41:05.778
I will put him right”.

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:08.955
He had a very big name in Maharastra, Gagangiri Maharaj, you see,

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.238
he is a very big man. He never beats anyone and all that.

00:41:13.263 --> 00:41:17.736
One fellow came to me and he started saying, “Mother, you must

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.745
not give Realisation to everyone.

00:41:19.772 --> 00:41:21.522
 You try to give Realisation to everyone.

00:41:21.536 --> 00:41:24.932
You go to [unclear] with me, he was giving me a big lecture.

00:41:24.957 --> 00:41:28.878
So, I told him, “All right. You go and see the Gagangiri Maharaj.

00:41:28.898 --> 00:41:32.115
He has called you”. He felt very enamoured, “Oh, my goodness!

00:41:32.142 --> 00:41:36.389
Gagangiri Maharaj has called me!” So he went to Gagangiri.

00:41:36.956 --> 00:41:39.321
After one month, I was sitting, one man,

00:41:39.348 --> 00:41:44.473
where I was having a program. And this fellow came

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:51.018
with both the legs around his neck, dangling like that.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.873
Two people watched,

00:41:52.893 --> 00:41:56.676
 “What happened, what has happened?”

00:41:57.384 --> 00:42:01.853
He said, “Guru ‘kripa’ [grace]. This is the blessing of the guru.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.678
So, “What happened?”

00:42:04.005 --> 00:42:07.048
 “Mother, I didn’t do much, you see. I just told him

00:42:07.073 --> 00:42:10.046
that Mother should not give Realisation to everyone.

00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:12.925
Anyone comes in, she gives Realisation.

00:42:12.945 --> 00:42:15.746
She has no discrimination and all that.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.623
So in the night when I was sleeping,

00:42:18.648 --> 00:42:26.253
his tiger came, perhaps, and threw me in a cant.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.192
I came down about 80 feet down the hill.

00:42:30.705 --> 00:42:34.608
I said, “80 feet?” “Yes, I saw a [unclear]

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.425
and I broke my legs.

00:42:37.866 --> 00:42:45.266
So after two days, somebody poured some chapattis,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.838
 I eat”. “80 feet?”

00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:51.679
 “No, no. He might have come down from the other side,

00:42:51.692 --> 00:42:54.562
from where it is but it came to me”.

00:42:54.683 --> 00:42:57.033
Then he ate.

00:42:57.058 --> 00:42:58.948
“Then what happened?”

00:42:58.975 --> 00:43:02.805
“I was lying like that for 4 or 5 days, and nobody would bother about me.

00:43:02.812 --> 00:43:06.046
After 5 days, some people came, lifted me,

00:43:06.071 --> 00:43:08.676
took me there and gave me a bath and all that”.

00:43:11.769 --> 00:43:15.087
So, then this guru said,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.217
 “Put these broken legs on your neck

00:43:20.242 --> 00:43:23.094
and go dangling to your Mother.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:25.476
She will cure you, not me”.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.680
“My goodness! “,

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:29.583
 I said, “Really?”

00:43:29.597 --> 00:43:32.940
Tears came into my eyes. I said, “What?

00:43:33.007 --> 00:43:35.615
So, I fixed his legs, you see.

00:43:35.635 --> 00:43:38.263
He is still there. I fixed his legs.

00:43:38.743 --> 00:43:41.022
And I said, “Now what did you say?”

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.010
 “No, I just said, ‘This Mother has no discretion.

00:43:44.024 --> 00:43:46.629
She gives Realisation to everyone, and all that’.

00:43:46.643 --> 00:43:48.836
But what a punishment he gave me!”

00:43:48.845 --> 00:43:51.519
I said, “You see, that is what gurus are.

00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:53.994
If they are real gurus, they don’t want money,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.842
but they hit you hard. I know that”.

00:43:56.855 --> 00:43:59.388
But I didn’t know they were so cruel as this!

00:43:59.404 --> 00:44:01.520
The next time I met him, this fellow, I told him,

00:44:01.545 --> 00:44:04.587
 “But what do you mean by being so cruel with these students”.

00:44:04.615 --> 00:44:06.930
He said, “Thank God, he didn’t die!

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:09.991
Such people should not live, who talk such ill of Mother”.

00:44:10.018 --> 00:44:11.105
But why this?

00:44:11.129 --> 00:44:13.075
Such horrible things!

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:16.629
I said, “Baba, [unclear] nobody, I’m not going to send anyone to this,

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.349
to any Gurus now, it’s finished”.

00:44:18.374 --> 00:44:21.321
There are some real ones who are real,

00:44:21.346 --> 00:44:24.143
who are extremely harsh,

00:44:24.943 --> 00:44:27.979
very harsh and troublesome.

00:44:28.234 --> 00:44:31.554
 But this is the job of love.

00:44:31.952 --> 00:44:34.773
If you have an ocean of love within yourself,

00:44:34.793 --> 00:44:37.788
you don’t have to torture anyone for that.

00:44:39.074 --> 00:44:41.747
It’s not necessary.

00:44:41.767 --> 00:44:44.255
While talking to you, you got your Realisation.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.078
I didn’t do anything to you, it just worked out.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.788
If it worked out, it is there.

00:44:55.898 --> 00:44:58.725
And now it is becoming very easy.

00:44:59.635 --> 00:45:04.524
Formerly I had to work at least for 15 to 20 minutes.

00:45:05.473 --> 00:45:07.639
And with the English even more.

00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:10.325
He’s one of them [Laughter]

00:45:11.637 --> 00:45:14.330
One of the early ones. They’re really.

00:45:14.707 --> 00:45:20.552
But now, yesterday you saw, in 5 minutes, given.

00:45:21.712 --> 00:45:23.725
So, it just takes on speed.

00:45:27.096 --> 00:45:30.369
I may go away tomorrow. I am sorry to say.

00:45:30.406 --> 00:45:33.847
I would have been so happy to stay over here with you.

00:45:34.613 --> 00:45:37.501
But I may go tomorrow.

00:45:38.547 --> 00:45:41.903
But you should look after these people.

00:45:41.928 --> 00:45:46.254
Then they will look after you. All right?

00:46:01.042 --> 00:46:03.929
I think now it is time.

00:46:18.757 --> 00:46:20.323
May God bless you.

00:46:20.364 --> 00:46:23.217
Very good, your kundalini is very good.

00:46:23.242 --> 00:46:25.369
I’m very happy. May God bless you.

00:46:26.162 --> 00:46:29.043
Feeling the cool breeze?

00:46:29.057 --> 00:46:31.785
Child: Jai Shri Mataji.

00:46:31.812 --> 00:46:35.673
Really? Here it may come.

00:46:36.015 --> 00:46:37.834
They are like Maharashtrians.

00:46:37.843 --> 00:46:40.289
Then they have to say ‘yes’ they do like this.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.966
[Nodding for ‘no’] Mee too, I am Maharashtrian.

00:46:52.127 --> 00:46:53.260
Sahaja Yogi: Excellent.

00:46:53.288 --> 00:46:57.267
This is the first Egyptian.

00:46:58.903 --> 00:47:02.756
 Yes. May God bless you.

00:47:08.822 --> 00:47:14.183
Guido: He wanted to give us- this is something to put the [unclear] cards.

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:20.384
Guido: He collected all the cards from all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:20.411 --> 00:47:21.611
Guido: For you.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:31.982
May God bless you.

00:47:32.163 --> 00:47:35.411
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you so much.

00:47:44.683 --> 00:47:47.369
Where are the newspapers? You see now.

00:47:48.178 --> 00:47:51.057
Also to you people. See now,

00:47:51.064 --> 00:47:53.500
it [unclear] about me.

00:48:01.766 --> 00:48:06.194
 He might give one also- he’s done it.

00:48:06.215 --> 00:48:10.409
Now these are for [unclear] take one with us..
