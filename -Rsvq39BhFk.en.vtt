00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.820
Now this one is a praise of Mahalakshmi tattwa,
Mahalakshmi principle.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:22.620
And as you know that, Lakshmi principle is
the power of Shri Vishnu, which first establishes

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:42.410
within us when we start paying attention to
dharmic material life, dharmic financial life

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.990
and dharmic family life.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:01:03.990
After that seeking starts, seeking into higher
realms there.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.510
It is manifested by the Mahalakshmi principle
within us.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.170
That’s why in affluent countries people
start seeking.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.560
They may go wrong, that’s different.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:31.560
In a person this exists but the manifestation
starts when you are completely satisfied with

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.210
you material side, not with Sahaj Yoga.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.340
In Sahaj Yoga it manifests and acts.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:58.060
So the central path of Mahalakshmi starts
opening out, so rises above your nabhi chakra,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.290
and goes up to your Sahastrara and pierces
through it.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.950
In the Sahastrara also it is the Vishnu tattwa
that becomes the Viraata — it’s only one

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.950
principle.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:27.290
It manifests itself in the Sahastrara and
you become aware of collective consciousness,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.709
you become knowledgeable and you know the
truth.

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.040
It’s through the rising of the Kundalini.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:46.390
Now here, they are only praising the middle
path, that’s the Mahalakshmi.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:55.739
So here you are singing to me, to the Mahalakshmi
principle of mine.

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:08.150
But when it reaches the Sahastrara, in Sahastrara
it become the Mahamaya.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:19.290
In the Sahastrara, it gets the power of the
Mahamaya, by which it has a thousand facets

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:31.330
and it puts you into illusions to test you
and to help you — in the Sahastrara.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.290
But otherwise it has incarnated many a times.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:47.959
Like we can say the Lakshmi has incarnated
on this Earth as Sita, as Radha, as Mary the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.530
mother of Christ, and ultimately as your Mother.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.269
But that’s only the central path and only
the one principle of Mahalakshmi.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.120
So now here, you are praising me as Mahalakshmi.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:13.150
So first they say “Oh Mahalakshmi, that’s
Mother, we praise you as Mahamaya — is the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.021
One who creates this illusion of the world.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:22.160
And you are the One who takes us out of this
illusion.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:39.560
And you are the peetha, is the seat, or the
seat of the Shri Chakra.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.660
And all the Gods worship you: “Shri peethe
sura pujite”.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.220
“Shanka chakra gada haste” — because
it’s a Laksmi, you see, it’s the power

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.590
of Vishnu.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:01.740
He has shanka, that is the conch, the chakra
and the gada in the hand.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.910
So, “Nirmala devi namostute, Mahalakshmi
namostute."

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.740
Now again Shri Vishnu is on the condor, the
Garuda.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.820
So “Namaste garurha ruhe” — You are
the one who is going on the Garuda.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.250
It’s so scientific.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.800
She’s the power of Vishnu, of Narayana,
of Viraata, the central path.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.200
How nicely, so She has all the weapons of
Shri Vishnu.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.100
She rides on the Garuda.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:46.300
“Kohlasura bayankari” — She’s the
one who killed Kohlasura.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.480
Kohlasura is the one who was residing in Kohlapur.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:59.930
She killed [him] there and there she appeared,
manifested in the temple.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:07.100
That’s why in Kolhapur you have got Mahalakshmi’s
temple.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:23.750
And “Sarvapapa hare Devi” — you are
the one who takes away all our sins, removes

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.910
all our sins.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.910
“Mahalakshmi namostute”

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.300
“Sarvagye sarvavarade” — because Lakshmi
principle becomes Mahalakshmi, becomes then

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.570
the Viratangana, is the power of the Viraata,
is the same, [so] you know everything because

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.100
it is knowledge, it is the truth.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.710
That’s the principle of truth, knowledge.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.820
So, She is the one who knows everything: “Sarvagye
sarvavarade”

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.850
You are the one who gives all the blessings,
is the Mahalakshmi who gives you the blessings.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:05.550
“Sarvadushta bhayankari” — And you are
the one who is a terrible personality for

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:18.690
all those who are cruel — remember that!
— who are cruel people.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:28.370
“Sarvadukha hare Devi” — You are the
One who takes away all the pains of the people.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:36.610
Also the name of Shri Vishnu is Dhanvantari,
meaning the doctor; one of the names.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:45.130
That means the Vishnu principle has got the
power to cure you, to give you relief from

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.790
pain.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.660
Through that power You take away all our pain.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.080
It’s true isn’t it.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.110
“Sarvadukha hare Devi, Mahalakshmi namotute”

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:07.000
“Siddhi buddhi prade Devi” — You are
the One who is the giver of siddhis.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.540
Now you have got siddhis, you can raise Kundalini,
you can cure people, you can know everything

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.130
on your central nervous system — are the
siddhis by which you know absolute knowledge.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.900
You are the One who gives absolute knowledge.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:27.480
Through the central path of Mahalakshmi you
get to know of the absolute knowledge.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.580
So you are the giver of siddhis and buddhi.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:39.039
You are the One who gives us the wisdom, buddhi,
is the intelligence, is the pure intelligence.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.539
Pure intelligence comes from the central path.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.690
You just see how they have described.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:55.259
So you will be amazed that, if you sing the
song of, say, Shri Krishna or of Shri Rama,

00:08:55.259 --> 00:09:02.689
or of Shri Vishnu or of Mahalakshmi, they
will have the same qualities described, because

00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:06.160
they are one personality.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.670
If you have their names, they will never intermingle.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:18.269
Shiva will have His own qualities, Vishnu
will have his own qualities and Brahma will

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:22.410
have his own qualities — they are all separated.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:39.999
So now here, what is the other quality is
that, in the middle, madhyankar, in the middle

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:50.149
of the ocean, in between the time, in the
interval part, You are the one who becomes

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:55.920
in the heart, the power of Shiva.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.920
You know that.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:07.379
See how clearly it is said, that, “In between
You become the power of Shiva and the One

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:18.139
who is the power of Maheshwara, is the Shiva."

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:19.410
Your the same middle path becomes.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.889
“Yogade yoga sambhute” — You are the
One who makes it possible to get yoga.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:30.829
You make us in such a way, ‘sambhute’
, ‘sambhut’ means you can make the situation

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:36.329
in such a way that we can get our Realisation,
yoga.

00:10:36.329 --> 00:10:39.149
Not only that but you give Realisation.

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:56.730
Is the Mahalakshmi part of it.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:03.779
You can become extremely subtle and extremely
gross.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:10.790
So you can talk of very, very subtle things.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:20.689
And you can move into human beings in a very
subtle manner and You can also, have a very

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:30.529
gross appearance, very gross behaviour, very
gross method, to handle the gross people.

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:34.629
I use that, you know that.

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:52.329
“Stula sukshma Maharaudre” — now You
are gross as well as very subtle and You are

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:55.939
the greatest destructive power ‘maharaudre’.

00:11:55.939 --> 00:12:03.179
‘Raudra’ is the power of Shiva, which
is destructive, but you are the one which

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:04.199
is the Maharaudre.

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:12.049
You have the power, the highest power of destruction,
the greatest power of destruction – maharaudre.

00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:22.569
“Mahashakti mahodare” — You have a big
stomach and in that You contain all the powers,

00:12:22.569 --> 00:12:25.699
the great powers, within Your stomach.

00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:26.850
‘Maharaudre, mahodare”.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:33.299
“Mahapapa hare Devi” — You are the one
who removes all our sins.

00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:35.379
Papa is [sins].

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:38.949
And that is the One we worship.

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:41.019
“Padmasana stite Devi."

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:42.050
You sit in the lotus.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.930
You are sitting in the lotus.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.459
You will find Lakshmi always standing in the
lotus, but Mahalakshmi sits on the lotus.

00:12:49.459 --> 00:12:54.009
You must have seen in the temple of Kolhapur
they have very, very big lotuses they give.

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:55.370
They grow there.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.430
They do not grow anywhere else but there only
— such big, big lotuses.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:04.329
Even in the Himalayas you won’t find them,
but at Mahalakshmi temple.

00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:07.649
See how it’s all being done.

00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:11.339
Whatever is described you get the proof of
it.

00:13:11.339 --> 00:13:16.779
Now they describe, supposing, the flowers
that are liked say by Mahakali.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:21.319
So if you go to [mount] Abu which is where
is the Ambas this thing [temple], you will

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:25.480
find the same flowers that are champakas and
all those are more there.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:32.379
Then a kind of a fragrance that She likes
out of a glue called as gulgul.

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:35.089
They have described also about Her.

00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:40.389
And that’s the place you find it, nowhere
else.

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:46.419
How the Mother Earth is also keeping those
limitations and those compartments meant for

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:49.149
different, different Goddesses.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:56.839
So She sits on the lotus, sits.

00:13:56.839 --> 00:14:01.620
She sits there and She establishes Herself
there.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:09.779
Also it means that She sits on the lotuses
of your chakras and She establishes your lotuses.

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:18.249
So, throughout, in all the centres here, it
is the Mahalakshmi power, in different forms

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:21.869
and manifestations [that] works out the opening
of the chakras.

00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:28.100
Even here where She becomes Madhyantar, in
the middle, in the little interval, [when]

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.319
She becomes, at that time, the power of Shiva,
it is Mahalakshmi.

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:35.680
So the principle is the same, of Mahalakshmi.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.209
What is the principle of Mahalakshmi?

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.379
Is the ascent.

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:42.629
She helps the ascent of the Kundalini.

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:47.310
Because when the Kundalini rises there are
so many things to be done to keep the Kundalini

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:54.569
moving upward, not to make her fall down,
to open different chakras at different times,

00:14:54.569 --> 00:14:59.920
and what you call the bandhas, are to keep
the central path in such a way that it [the

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.739
Kundalini] is pushed up and it is not allowed
to fall down.

00:15:03.739 --> 00:15:08.449
All that is done through Mahalakshmi principle.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:12.680
“Parabrahma swarupini” — She is the
One who is Parabrahma.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.050
She is the One which is the All-pervading
Power.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.389
Because of that we have the knowledge.

00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:26.379
Because of that All-pervading Power of God
we get knowledge on our fingertips.

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:32.649
So it acts through your brain as Mahamaya,
through your nerves as boddhas, and all around

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:34.329
you you get the information.

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:43.949
So you become part and parcel of the whole
cosmos and you become a very efficient, already

00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:47.389
programmed, computer.

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:54.250
She wears white dress.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:16:03.529
Whenever we have [public] programme I wear
white: “Shwetambara dhare Devi” — She

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.749
wears [white].

00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:10.680
That’s the time I have to give Realisation,
so I am Mahalakshmi.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.910
At the puja time I am Mahakali or Adi Shakti.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:22.139
Mahakali is Adi Shakti…

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:26.059
(break in recording)

00:16:26.059 --> 00:16:31.299
…Down to earth personality.

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:37.839
“Jagatstite” — down to earth (practical).

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:43.479
And She is the Mother of the whole universe,
of this world.

00:16:43.479 --> 00:16:44.479
So Mahalakshmi.

00:16:44.479 --> 00:16:56.329
Now, these two others [verses] are those who
read these stotras, these mantras about Nirmala

00:16:56.329 --> 00:17:15.880
Devi and do it with complete dedication, they
get all kinds of siddhis which are never lost.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:28.730
They get the Kingdom of God forever.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:36.150
The one who reads it once, it removes all
your sins.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:49.380
Those who read it twice get into dhyana, into
samadhi state — only twice!

00:17:49.380 --> 00:18:00.950
If you read it three times, anyone who is
anti-God and troubling you gets destroyed.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.080
Sahaja Yogi: We did it only twice Shri Mataji!

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:20.070
Shri Mataji: You have done it already twice
ah?

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.789
(laughter)

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:37.730
So, the one who becomes Nirmala Devi, means
who cleanses out, becomes an auspicious person,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.590
becomes auspicious — shubha.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:59.350
Because She’s the one, she gets prasanna,
over-pleased, She’s over-pleased and that’s

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:11.179
how She gives you blessings and you become
auspicious, because you are clean in heart,

00:19:11.179 --> 00:19:20.950
there isn’t any ego, there isn’t any conditioning,
you have a very clean attention and clean

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.860
heart.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:31.710
It’s the same now repeated, is the “Namastestu
Mahamaye, Shri peethe sura pujite.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.889
Shanka chakra gada haste, Shri Nirmala Devi
Namostute."

00:19:36.889 --> 00:19:48.730
It is a very, I should say, a precise, scientific
study.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.970
Even when you take names.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:57.159
I am amazed at these people, those who have
written.

00:19:57.159 --> 00:20:00.120
I don’t know how.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:08.320
Like the mantras in the puja.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.440
What a description!

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:17.549
You start wondering what Divine eyes they
must have had.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:27.149
I think at least your eyes should develop
to that state where you see those mantras.

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:33.000
We don’t have to create, but see that reflection,
if it is true or not.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.450
It looks very fantastic but it’s a fact.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.990
Some of the mantras really, it’s surprising
how they know!

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.850
I myself don’t know how they found it out!

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.309
(laughter).

00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:53.429
But their discoveries show their depth, their
love, their dedication and understanding of

00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:54.940
what I am.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:05.169
Of course, at this stage I am a Mahamaya:
rather difficult, but still try.

00:21:05.169 --> 00:21:20.460
Also intellectuals, the so-called intellectuals,
are the people, I think, who would walk backwards.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.830
They can’t see the front.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.659
If you walk backwards what do you see?

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:32.590
The reality is going out from you backwards.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.451
It’s very difficult to talk to them.

00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:40.529
They always find something that is very surprisingly
funny to me.

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:44.860
But those who have the inner side [developed]
they see it so precisely, so clearly.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.320
I mean, these were written long time back.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.450
Of course, this one is written by Adi Shankaracharya.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.210
But thousands of years back they have written
things.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:59.559
Like Markandeya, he has described my knees,
can you imagine?

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:06.769
He must have crawled up to my knees to see
or what?

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:09.159
It’s exactly the same.

00:22:09.159 --> 00:22:13.570
And here he says there are three folds, it’s
a fact.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:20.539
All the time I have three folds, which human
beings don’t have: one on here, another

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.230
here, another here.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.230
I have to have.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.759
The eyebrows are described, everything.

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:31.639
It’s surprising.

00:22:31.639 --> 00:22:39.539
They never saw me, I think, otherwise.

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:49.650
I didn’t exist before, as manifested, on
this Earth, but they saw me all right, especially

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.650
Markandeya.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:58.150
When you go to this Vani, you have been to,
the temple of Saptashringi — Saptashringi

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.060
means ‘which has got seven peaks’.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:14.090
It’s all right with me if I speak English
but [for] translation I am very bad.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:19.789
So the shikaras are the seven chakras, and
that’s the Adi Shakti.

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:26.820
And the face is exactly like mine, with a
thousand hands.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.690
And that is one temple [which] is not yet
spoiled.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.470
But this Mahalakshmi temple is spoiled.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.809
They get all the bhoots: not in front of Her
but at the back.

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:42.809
So we’ll have to remove that, and we’ll
manage.

00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:49.620
It has nothing to do with a particular religion
or particular thing, it’s the inner understanding,

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.769
it’s the inner awakening — which is the
truth.

00:23:53.769 --> 00:23:58.649
Now, one can say, “Why didn’t Christ say?”

00:23:58.649 --> 00:24:01.290
He did in a way.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.390
He did.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:07.809
But just see where he was born, where there
was no tradition, no understanding.

00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:11.070
He could not say all these things to us, could
he?

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:15.120
Even in India, how many people understand?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.710
I asked so many people, “Why do you sing
this song in the temple of Mahalakshmi when

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.340
it is you are taking about Ambe?”

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.559
They didn’t know.

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:25.600
Nobody knows.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:32.169
Even the ones who worshipped, have been there
in that temple, have been their forefathers

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:36.159
and forefathers and forefathers, they don’t
know.

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:38.309
They don’t know.

00:24:38.309 --> 00:24:42.360
But at least they have the background.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:48.669
But what’s the use of the background [of]
which you don’t understand anything?

00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:58.850
Like a blind person, whether he stands next
to the flowers or to a donkey, God knows.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.950
Now you are the ones who know.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:12.160
But still, still we have to see for ourselves.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.160
Many miracles, many things happen.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.140
I hope you see the photographs.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.200
Have they seen the photographs?

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.799
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:24.299
Shri Mataji: All of you have seen?

00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:32.030
Have you seen the Deities?

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.120
Yogis: No.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.760
Shri Mataji: No?

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:49.040
Oh God, where is it Gavin?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.679
That’s very convincing!

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:58.080
Now, there are photographs that have come
out.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:08.220
I am sitting like this and the cloth that
separates the brides and the bridegrooms is

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.240
just in.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:15.020
You can see all the Deities sitting here,
around.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.030
All of them!

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.499
Then all the bridegrooms are blessed with
light.

00:26:18.499 --> 00:26:22.889
And you see all the arrows, which are described
now, that he sends arrows of love.

00:26:22.889 --> 00:26:29.190
Because they are getting married the Cupid
sends his arrows.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:35.200
Then there are flowers which are Divine flowers,
for the brides.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:46.570
And the one who is holding also that cloth
has got his Shri Chakra very clearly shown.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.559
And all of you are sitting and on top you
is the light.

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:58.179
If you see it the other way round, it’s
my name written in Arabic!

00:26:58.179 --> 00:27:08.450
Also it looks like, a little bit, your cardiograph.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:11.880
Everybody has light.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.820
Everybody is a realised-soul.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.650
It’s beautiful.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:25.700
You must see that, and then you will know
your value, you will know your situation and

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.450
you will know what you are — you are all
realised-souls; not only realised-souls [but]

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.450
Sahaj Yogis!

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:38.749
You know all about chakras, you know how to
raise the Kundalini, you know how to give

00:27:38.749 --> 00:27:39.749
Realisation.

00:27:39.749 --> 00:27:47.090
Such powerful people never lived on this Earth,
never existed, were never known.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.650
You have entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:55.970
Not only that but you are on the stage and
everybody is looking after you.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:28:01.400
You should see these photographs and you will
be convinced about it.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:08.240
These were taken by an ordinary student, by
the small camera that you gave him as a present.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.809
He brought and he said, “I can’t understand
what is all this English."

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:16.400
Poor fellow!

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.970
Trying to see this way that way.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:27.290
You all should see it carefully, and then
we’ll enlarge and we’ll send it over to

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:28.290
people.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.290
All the centres must have it.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:33.499
Have you seen my photographs in the sky?

00:28:33.499 --> 00:28:37.700
You’ve seen the photographs of the vibrations
on my house, Pratisthan.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:45.879
But these are very remarkable photographs
I must say.

00:28:45.879 --> 00:28:51.779
They should convince you of your powers, of
you greatness, that you are very different,

00:28:51.779 --> 00:29:00.409
special people and you have to live like special
people, not to be bowed down by useless things

00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:03.020
like, “My wife is like this!”

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.519
“My husband like this,” “My child like
this."

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:13.029
Who are your brothers and sisters?

00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:22.690
Gyaneshwara has said, “They are all going
to be related."

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.769
“Soyeri ka hote."

00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:28.220
“They will all be related.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.659
Those who are in heaven.

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:31.659
They are the oceans.

00:29:31.659 --> 00:29:43.399
Each one of them is the speaking ocean of
ambrosa.

00:29:43.399 --> 00:29:53.010
And they are the great forests of boon giving
trees."

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.549
That’s you!

00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:57.769
He describes you like that.

00:29:57.769 --> 00:30:01.480
I mean, He never exaggerated.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:14.769
He says, “Come along, you are the forests
of boon giving trees."

00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:22.010
So let’s start one by one ahh?

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.169
Haa!

00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:27.749
Also you see the angels.

00:30:27.749 --> 00:30:34.350
So first one with the Deities.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:40.090
I am looking like a heart in the centre and
the rest of them are sitting behind me as

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.090
Deities.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.090
You can all have it together, to see.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:47.389
This is the first one.

00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:52.520
All right.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:31:17.899
Now, here goes the second one where you find
the angels with their wings.

00:31:17.899 --> 00:31:25.309
Pass it on.

00:31:25.309 --> 00:31:35.030
Now, these are the arrows of love.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:46.470
Pass it on.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.289
(laughter).

00:31:50.289 --> 00:32:05.590
Now these are the blessings on the bridegrooms.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:15.740
Now here I look like a white pitcher and here
are all the vibrations coming out from me.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.869
The white one is me.

00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:26.590
First see the Deities ones.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.380
You see, one by one [the] series you must
see.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.330
If you see it the other way round.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.269
Now here are the brides blessed by Divine
flowers.

00:32:36.269 --> 00:33:05.899
This is the Shri Chakra of the person who
was holding that cloth.

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:25.909
This is my name written on top of your heads,
if you see the other way round you can see,

00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:30.210
if you know Arabic.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.279
Everyone.

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:39.739
I have always told you that the vibrations
are like half commas, like the moon of the

00:33:39.739 --> 00:33:40.830
first day.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:47.120
And you see me, a bundle of vibrations.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.419
Yogi: It is [written] ‘Allah’, is God’s
name.

00:33:53.419 --> 00:33:57.429
Shri Mataji: But if you put it like this,
it is my name.

00:33:57.429 --> 00:33:59.619
You see it is ‘Nir-mala’.

00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:01.460
And ‘Allah’ otherwise, you see.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:07.970
‘Allah’ if you see it from this side,
and from this side is ‘Nirmala’.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.669
Yogi: Oh!!!

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:13.520
(applause).

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:22.770
Shri Mataji: ‘Allah’ is Viraata.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.809
This is the one where Hanumana was sitting
before me.

00:34:27.809 --> 00:34:37.309
I see all that but you don’t see, that’s
[what] the trouble is.

00:34:37.309 --> 00:34:44.690
Yogis: (laughter)

00:34:44.690 --> 00:35:02.319
Shri Mataji: These are the two names [sides]
of one coin: one is ‘Nirmala’ the other

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:03.640
is ‘Allah’.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:11.270
Also it is ‘Nirmala’ and ‘Sadashiva’.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:20.090
Also it is ‘Nirmala’ and ‘Brahmadeva’.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:30.210
So Allah is the same as Jehovah.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:37.460
Pass it on to others to see.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:44.230
We’ll have to make it big and we’ll get
them enlarged, isn’t it Gavin?

00:35:44.230 --> 00:36:23.069
This one is missing where the bullock carts
are.

00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:41.630
So the muslims must have some sense in there
heads that’s why it is in Arabic.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:51.609
They are the blindest people you can ever
think of, fanatics: this madman Khomeini.

00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:53.109
He was dying, still he’s surviving.

00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:54.620
He should not feel happy when he’s dying.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.620
Let him die!

00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:56.609
Can I have them (the photographs) back?

00:37:56.609 --> 00:37:57.640
The ladies have seen?

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.750
All of you pass it that side first of all.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.940
If somebody has not seen all of these?

00:38:01.940 --> 00:39:08.540
The last and not the least: this is for all
of you to understand that leadership is a

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.670
myth.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:13.350
There’s nobody like a leader in the Kingdom
of God.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:23.960
It’s not that a leader will be asked to
go first inside.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.329
Nothing of the kind! (laughter)

00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:31.089
But the worst are the leaders wives, they
start thinking themselves to be leaders.

00:39:31.089 --> 00:39:33.530
They are the worst of all.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.450
Don’t treat the wives of leaders as leaders.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:47.710
And they have no business to guide anyone
or to tell anyone.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.599
Be very careful on that point!

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:54.630
All such wives I don’t know where they’ll
end up.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:59.609
It’s very common [that] those women who
have nothing in them try to bask in the glory

00:39:59.609 --> 00:40:01.580
of their husbands.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:05.289
You see so many prime ministers are like that,
their wives.

00:40:05.289 --> 00:40:17.170
So many of them we have had: Mrs Kennedy we
have had, Mao Tse Tung’s wife, we had the

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:26.820
wife of Chanta Sheik, of this Carlos also
of this…

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.960
Yogi: Mrs.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.030
Marcos.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:48.720
Shri Mataji: You see the wives of leaders
must keep themselves as non-identities.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:41:02.320
Any woman who tries such things will harm
the whole organisation.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.900
Like people say Nancy Reagan rules her husband.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.900
Imagine!

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.010
Shameful thing she does.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.460
Ambav’s wife ruined him, that’s what they
say.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.640
I mean everywhere they talk about this kind
of a thing.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.250
So no leader’s wife is to be treated like
a leader by any chance!

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.109
Not to be given any importance.

00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:29.600
And they are to be put down in their own places.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.910
First of all they think they work very hard.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.410
God knows what work they do!

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.890
They think no end of themselves.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.520
They have to work very hard like all others.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:44.650
They are like all other women, they are not
to have any special position.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:48.790
That’s the sign of a real Sahaj Yogini.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:58.340
You’ll be amazed, though I am Adi Shakti,
I never go into my husband’s office; never,

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.950
never telephone to him, never use anyone from
his office.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:10.660
Nor do I to any one of his people, whatever
may be the difficulty, whether I have Sahaja

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.490
Yoga or not.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:17.360
And this I have done all my life.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.080
I never preach Sahaja Yoga in any one of his
offices.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.180
Anybody from his offices I said, “Keep out!

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:31.750
You are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga till my
husband is working with you."

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:38.630
And if I telephone to him he thinks I must
have met with an accident!

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:42.120
He gets so upset.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:51.150
But to bask in the glory of a father or husband
is a sign of a woman who doesn’t have any

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:54.980
personality: she must be a useless woman,
absolutely.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.140
Show no special respect for such women!

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:04.940
They must stand in their own dignity like
all other Sahaj Yoginis are.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:12.339
They have no business to take any decision
as wives of the leaders.

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:17.859
They have to be humble, intelligent.

00:43:17.859 --> 00:43:21.760
They have to work hard.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.740
I have to do a lot of work for my husband:
I cook for his friends, I clean his ships.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:31.589
Such a lot of things I have done for him.

00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:34.059
I have decorated his ships.

00:43:34.059 --> 00:43:36.619
Whatever type of work he has done.

00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:40.700
I have to feed his clerks and his chaprasis
(junior office worker), his peons.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.900
Everything I have done, lots of things.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.299
But never, never once I asked [for anything].

00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:51.970
I have to bring presents for his secretaries
and other people.

00:43:51.970 --> 00:44:01.289
I think before Christmas I have to give presents
to all of them but never, never asked the

00:44:01.289 --> 00:44:13.450
driver even to bring the car or even to bring
the medicine or even to bring the letter which

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.110
has arrived.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.849
That should be the attitude, that’s a sign
of your dignity.

00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:22.440
You are not here because you are somebody’s
wife!

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.640
You are here because you are a Sahaja Yogi
and a Sahaja Yogini.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:31.160
All these complications come because your
attention is more on the husband or the wife

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:39.940
and not on me, and you don’t love me enough.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.930
If you love me you will know me very well.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:46.690
Like the people who have known me, they only
loved me.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:52.140
And I don’t gain anything out of your love,
you have to gain something by loving me.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:57.670
This is the last message I give you.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:05.010
Horrible things I have seen happening to leaders
— and to different ashrams and different

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:11.710
cities and different countries — because
the wife is a negative woman.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:15.880
And negativity always goes through the wives.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:22.230
Always you will find politicians attacked
through their children, through their wives,

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:24.630
through somebody else.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:29.910
And the leaders must put them down in their
own places.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:40.650
You must have seen when my daughter came and
I asked her to come on the stage, she would

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:41.690
not.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:52.109
I had to tell her, “At least come in front!”

00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:55.240
She would not.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:01.369
Always the wives are more susceptible, vulnerable
to negativity, so they have to be extremely

00:46:01.369 --> 00:46:03.099
careful.

00:46:03.099 --> 00:46:07.380
They should not take any decisions.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:15.609
I have seen if they are miserly wives, horrid
they are, horrid.

00:46:15.609 --> 00:46:21.210
The leaders are there because of their own
position, not because of their wives by any

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:22.210
chance.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:26.700
In this I am muslim I think.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.930
If it’s a lady who is the leader, she should
not look at her husbands face all the time,

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.240
what he has to say.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:45.049
She should behave like a leader and should
not praise her husband beyond a certain point:

00:46:45.049 --> 00:46:50.902
he doesn’t matter in Sahaj Yoga.

00:46:50.902 --> 00:46:51.902
All right?

00:46:51.902 --> 00:46:52.902
I hope you understand.

00:46:52.902 --> 00:46:59.480
The women are the power behind the man and
they are not the manifestation of the power

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.920
of their husbands.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.700
They have to give power to their husbands
and not to use his powers for their own use.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:17.130
It’s a sign of a person who is very low
level and has no self-respect.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:23.849
There are many subtle ways by [which] they
assert themselves, so be very careful, very,

00:47:23.849 --> 00:47:25.930
very careful.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:32.740
All the Sahaj Yogis must also remember that
your husbands or wives should not guide you

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.450
in Sahaj Yog.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:42.660
Another point is that, in the name of ‘love’
you go on hugging each other: please don’t

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660
do it!

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.140
The Kundalini gets affected.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.589
Kissing each other.

00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:50.740
It’s all right men can hug men, women can
hug women.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.190
But not too much of it [is] also not so good.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:57.180
Maybe a bhoot does that more because she wants
to pass on bhoots into your body.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.180
Better to keep out.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.890
But the kissing business must be stopped immediately.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:05.910
I mean, this French style of kissing everybody
is horrid!

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.190
You get a shock you know.

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:17.890
Any time you meet a French man you don’t
know where he is going to kiss you.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:23.380
These are our private things, whom to kiss,
whom not to kiss.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:29.309
How can we be exposed to every person like
that?

00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:33.849
Even children should not be kissed much, and
if you have to kiss, kiss on their hands and

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:34.849
on their heads.

00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:46.020
Then in the name of affection, love and compassion
we go to bhoots.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:53.440
Now if somebody is sick, say, with AIDS you
have nothing to do with that person.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.109
Anybody who is sick you don’t have to do
anything with that sick person: give my photograph,

00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:58.109
I’ll look after.

00:48:58.109 --> 00:49:05.040
You don’t have to go and cure anybody who
is sick because you have compassion.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:12.510
You don’t have more compassion than I have
and I don’t believe in small families of

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:16.940
husband, wife and one and a half child.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:23.140
I believe and you should also believe, which
is the truth, in the largest family, the big

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:29.330
family, where we are all part and parcel,
children of one Mother.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:36.770
So don’t waste your attention on your family
business — you’ll never grow.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:41.230
First you didn’t believe in family, you
didn’t believe in your children.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:45.420
Now you believe too much in your family, too
much in your children.

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:51.360
It’s just the same, what difference does
it make?

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.900
Whether you are in the pitcher or in the river,
it’s just the same: you are in the water

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.190
isn’t it.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:07.640
So we don’t believe in this kind of a small
family affairs, “My wife, my son, my this."

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:15.789
These limitations must be broken and you must
think yourself to be a Sahaj Yogi first and

00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:17.420
last.

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:21.880
Of course by the way you have a husband, by
the way you have a wife, by the way you have

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:27.589
children, but they shouldn’t form a major
part of your life.

00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:33.480
Your Spirit is the major part and the only
part that you have.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.880
The rest of it is just by the way.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:45.680
If they are realised-souls, if they are Sahaj
Yogis [then] all right, they are with you.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:52.130
Now, the last of the last, [is] that when
girls come from India you don’t think they

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:53.460
are all goddesses.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.500
Don’t pamper them!

00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:01.380
Don’t tell them that they are great: “You
look very beautiful."

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.380
You see, one girl came to Italy and all the
people said, “You are a classical beauty."

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.700
Can you imagine?

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.190
And this ‘classical beauty’ could not
get married for thirty-eight years!

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:14.070
And she really believed it [that] she was
a ‘classical beauty’.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:17.329
I don’t know what she thought of herself.

00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:21.770
And ultimately she became mad, she made her
husband mad.

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:23.609
So don’t treat them like goddesses.

00:51:23.609 --> 00:51:25.040
They are Indians, so what?

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.740
They are just like you — nothing so special!

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:34.049
But when they come here you try to pamper
them, give them presents, look after them.

00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:40.490
Then they become naughty, they become rude
and then you become unhappy.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.599
Treat them just like any other woman.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:49.000
Especially women they lose their heads very
fast.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.660
In India they are not treated like that once
they are married.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.600
And big, big problems you have caused me.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:01.000
There’s one lady who came to France: you
made such an ado out of her, now I don’t

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.059
know what to do with her.

00:52:02.059 --> 00:52:05.290
The husband doesn’t want her, the father
can’t look after her.

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.390
Another one came to Switzerland, another horrid
one.

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:13.130
And they know how to handle you now and they
know how to frighten you.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.160
Keep them down!

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:21.710
I’m allowing you even to give them two slaps
if they misbehave.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:24.810
Because they come from India they don’t
become something great.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.539
They are human beings, you are human beings.

00:52:26.539 --> 00:52:29.390
They are Sahaj Yogis, you are Sahaj Yogis.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.630
Don’t spoil their heads.

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:34.070
Don’t give them special treatment.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.039
They are just like all other Sahaj Yogis.

00:52:38.039 --> 00:52:45.670
It’s very surprising: it has caused me so
much of trouble.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:51.549
Some of them are quite negative, left-sided.

00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:56.589
Be careful!

00:52:56.589 --> 00:53:01.630
Very left-sided.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:04.230
And some of them are very right-sided too.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:11.789
So it’s not proper also [because] then we
have to leave them alone and then it’s a

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:19.960
bad name for us in Sahaj Yoga.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:30.930
Treat them just like ordinary people and immediately
they start showing off you let me know.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:31.930
This is very important.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:34.280
There are some very sensible women from India.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:38.500
I would say Chaya is one, who had come here,
Regis’s wife.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.260
She is very, very sensible.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:47.339
Yes, we have some very sensible, very, very
matured women, but also stupid [ones].

00:53:47.339 --> 00:53:49.190
Some of them have no background.

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.609
They come from very poor families sometimes.

00:53:51.609 --> 00:53:55.510
Sometimes they come from families where they
have suffered a lot and suddenly their heads

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:58.079
go off, so be careful.

00:53:58.079 --> 00:54:02.230
Some of them are from rich families so their
heads are off!

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:05.099
Keep them into balance.

00:54:05.099 --> 00:54:07.750
I think you have some problem there?
