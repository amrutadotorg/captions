WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:09.820
Now this one is a praise of Mahalakshmi tattwa,
Mahalakshmi principle.

00:10.020 --> 00:22.620
And as you know that, Lakshmi principle is
the power of Shri Vishnu, which first establishes

00:22.630 --> 00:42.410
within us when we start paying attention to
dharmic material life, dharmic financial life

00:42.410 --> 00:48.990
and dharmic family life.

00:48.990 --> 01:03.990
After that seeking starts, seeking into higher
realms there.

01:03.990 --> 01:08.510
It is manifested by the Mahalakshmi principle
within us.

01:08.510 --> 01:13.170
That’s why in affluent countries people
start seeking.

01:13.170 --> 01:17.560
They may go wrong, that’s different.

01:17.560 --> 01:31.560
In a person this exists but the manifestation
starts when you are completely satisfied with

01:31.560 --> 01:38.210
you material side, not with Sahaj Yoga.

01:38.210 --> 01:43.340
In Sahaj Yoga it manifests and acts.

01:43.340 --> 01:58.060
So the central path of Mahalakshmi starts
opening out, so rises above your nabhi chakra,

01:58.060 --> 02:03.290
and goes up to your Sahastrara and pierces
through it.

02:03.290 --> 02:08.950
In the Sahastrara also it is the Vishnu tattwa
that becomes the Viraata — it’s only one

02:08.950 --> 02:09.950
principle.

02:09.950 --> 02:27.290
It manifests itself in the Sahastrara and
you become aware of collective consciousness,

02:27.290 --> 02:31.709
you become knowledgeable and you know the
truth.

02:31.709 --> 02:36.040
It’s through the rising of the Kundalini.

02:36.040 --> 02:46.390
Now here, they are only praising the middle
path, that’s the Mahalakshmi.

02:46.390 --> 02:55.739
So here you are singing to me, to the Mahalakshmi
principle of mine.

02:55.739 --> 03:08.150
But when it reaches the Sahastrara, in Sahastrara
it become the Mahamaya.

03:08.150 --> 03:19.290
In the Sahastrara, it gets the power of the
Mahamaya, by which it has a thousand facets

03:19.290 --> 03:31.330
and it puts you into illusions to test you
and to help you — in the Sahastrara.

03:31.330 --> 03:37.290
But otherwise it has incarnated many a times.

03:37.290 --> 03:47.959
Like we can say the Lakshmi has incarnated
on this Earth as Sita, as Radha, as Mary the

03:47.959 --> 03:51.530
mother of Christ, and ultimately as your Mother.

03:51.530 --> 03:59.269
But that’s only the central path and only
the one principle of Mahalakshmi.

03:59.269 --> 04:03.120
So now here, you are praising me as Mahalakshmi.

04:03.120 --> 04:13.150
So first they say “Oh Mahalakshmi, that’s
Mother, we praise you as Mahamaya — is the

04:13.150 --> 04:18.021
One who creates this illusion of the world.

04:18.021 --> 04:22.160
And you are the One who takes us out of this
illusion.

04:22.160 --> 04:39.560
And you are the peetha, is the seat, or the
seat of the Shri Chakra.

04:39.560 --> 04:44.660
And all the Gods worship you: “Shri peethe
sura pujite”.

04:44.660 --> 04:50.220
“Shanka chakra gada haste” — because
it’s a Laksmi, you see, it’s the power

04:50.220 --> 04:51.590
of Vishnu.

04:51.590 --> 05:01.740
He has shanka, that is the conch, the chakra
and the gada in the hand.

05:01.740 --> 05:06.910
So, “Nirmala devi namostute, Mahalakshmi
namostute."

05:06.910 --> 05:12.740
Now again Shri Vishnu is on the condor, the
Garuda.

05:12.740 --> 05:17.820
So “Namaste garurha ruhe” — You are
the one who is going on the Garuda.

05:17.820 --> 05:20.250
It’s so scientific.

05:20.250 --> 05:26.800
She’s the power of Vishnu, of Narayana,
of Viraata, the central path.

05:26.800 --> 05:33.200
How nicely, so She has all the weapons of
Shri Vishnu.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.100
She rides on the Garuda.

05:37.100 --> 05:46.300
“Kohlasura bayankari” — She’s the
one who killed Kohlasura.

05:46.300 --> 05:51.480
Kohlasura is the one who was residing in Kohlapur.

05:51.480 --> 05:59.930
She killed [him] there and there she appeared,
manifested in the temple.

05:59.930 --> 06:07.100
That’s why in Kolhapur you have got Mahalakshmi’s
temple.

06:07.100 --> 06:23.750
And “Sarvapapa hare Devi” — you are
the one who takes away all our sins, removes

06:23.750 --> 06:24.910
all our sins.

06:24.910 --> 06:25.910
“Mahalakshmi namostute”

06:25.910 --> 06:30.300
“Sarvagye sarvavarade” — because Lakshmi
principle becomes Mahalakshmi, becomes then

06:30.300 --> 06:36.570
the Viratangana, is the power of the Viraata,
is the same, [so] you know everything because

06:36.570 --> 06:39.100
it is knowledge, it is the truth.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.710
That’s the principle of truth, knowledge.

06:41.710 --> 06:47.820
So, She is the one who knows everything: “Sarvagye
sarvavarade”

06:47.820 --> 06:53.850
You are the one who gives all the blessings,
is the Mahalakshmi who gives you the blessings.

06:53.850 --> 07:05.550
“Sarvadushta bhayankari” — And you are
the one who is a terrible personality for

07:05.550 --> 07:18.690
all those who are cruel — remember that!
— who are cruel people.

07:18.690 --> 07:28.370
“Sarvadukha hare Devi” — You are the
One who takes away all the pains of the people.

07:28.370 --> 07:36.610
Also the name of Shri Vishnu is Dhanvantari,
meaning the doctor; one of the names.

07:36.610 --> 07:45.130
That means the Vishnu principle has got the
power to cure you, to give you relief from

07:45.130 --> 07:47.790
pain.

07:47.790 --> 07:51.660
Through that power You take away all our pain.

07:51.660 --> 07:54.080
It’s true isn’t it.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.110
“Sarvadukha hare Devi, Mahalakshmi namotute”

07:57.110 --> 08:07.000
“Siddhi buddhi prade Devi” — You are
the One who is the giver of siddhis.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.540
Now you have got siddhis, you can raise Kundalini,
you can cure people, you can know everything

08:12.540 --> 08:18.130
on your central nervous system — are the
siddhis by which you know absolute knowledge.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.900
You are the One who gives absolute knowledge.

08:19.900 --> 08:27.480
Through the central path of Mahalakshmi you
get to know of the absolute knowledge.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.580
So you are the giver of siddhis and buddhi.

08:29.580 --> 08:39.039
You are the One who gives us the wisdom, buddhi,
is the intelligence, is the pure intelligence.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.539
Pure intelligence comes from the central path.

08:42.539 --> 08:45.690
You just see how they have described.

08:45.690 --> 08:55.259
So you will be amazed that, if you sing the
song of, say, Shri Krishna or of Shri Rama,

08:55.259 --> 09:02.689
or of Shri Vishnu or of Mahalakshmi, they
will have the same qualities described, because

09:02.689 --> 09:06.160
they are one personality.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.670
If you have their names, they will never intermingle.

09:10.670 --> 09:18.269
Shiva will have His own qualities, Vishnu
will have his own qualities and Brahma will

09:18.269 --> 09:22.410
have his own qualities — they are all separated.

09:22.410 --> 09:39.999
So now here, what is the other quality is
that, in the middle, madhyankar, in the middle

09:39.999 --> 09:50.149
of the ocean, in between the time, in the
interval part, You are the one who becomes

09:50.149 --> 09:55.920
in the heart, the power of Shiva.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
You know that.

09:56.920 --> 10:07.379
See how clearly it is said, that, “In between
You become the power of Shiva and the One

10:07.379 --> 10:18.139
who is the power of Maheshwara, is the Shiva."

10:18.139 --> 10:19.410
Your the same middle path becomes.

10:19.410 --> 10:23.889
“Yogade yoga sambhute” — You are the
One who makes it possible to get yoga.

10:23.889 --> 10:30.829
You make us in such a way, ‘sambhute’
, ‘sambhut’ means you can make the situation

10:30.829 --> 10:36.329
in such a way that we can get our Realisation,
yoga.

10:36.329 --> 10:39.149
Not only that but you give Realisation.

10:39.149 --> 10:56.730
Is the Mahalakshmi part of it.

10:56.730 --> 11:03.779
You can become extremely subtle and extremely
gross.

11:03.779 --> 11:10.790
So you can talk of very, very subtle things.

11:10.790 --> 11:20.689
And you can move into human beings in a very
subtle manner and You can also, have a very

11:20.689 --> 11:30.529
gross appearance, very gross behaviour, very
gross method, to handle the gross people.

11:30.529 --> 11:34.629
I use that, you know that.

11:34.629 --> 11:52.329
“Stula sukshma Maharaudre” — now You
are gross as well as very subtle and You are

11:52.329 --> 11:55.939
the greatest destructive power ‘maharaudre’.

11:55.939 --> 12:03.179
‘Raudra’ is the power of Shiva, which
is destructive, but you are the one which

12:03.179 --> 12:04.199
is the Maharaudre.

12:04.199 --> 12:12.049
You have the power, the highest power of destruction,
the greatest power of destruction – maharaudre.

12:12.049 --> 12:22.569
“Mahashakti mahodare” — You have a big
stomach and in that You contain all the powers,

12:22.569 --> 12:25.699
the great powers, within Your stomach.

12:25.699 --> 12:26.850
‘Maharaudre, mahodare”.

12:26.850 --> 12:33.299
“Mahapapa hare Devi” — You are the one
who removes all our sins.

12:33.299 --> 12:35.379
Papa is [sins].

12:35.379 --> 12:38.949
And that is the One we worship.

12:38.949 --> 12:41.019
“Padmasana stite Devi."

12:41.019 --> 12:42.050
You sit in the lotus.

12:42.050 --> 12:43.930
You are sitting in the lotus.

12:43.930 --> 12:49.459
You will find Lakshmi always standing in the
lotus, but Mahalakshmi sits on the lotus.

12:49.459 --> 12:54.009
You must have seen in the temple of Kolhapur
they have very, very big lotuses they give.

12:54.009 --> 12:55.370
They grow there.

12:55.370 --> 12:58.430
They do not grow anywhere else but there only
— such big, big lotuses.

12:58.430 --> 13:04.329
Even in the Himalayas you won’t find them,
but at Mahalakshmi temple.

13:04.329 --> 13:07.649
See how it’s all being done.

13:07.649 --> 13:11.339
Whatever is described you get the proof of
it.

13:11.339 --> 13:16.779
Now they describe, supposing, the flowers
that are liked say by Mahakali.

13:16.779 --> 13:21.319
So if you go to [mount] Abu which is where
is the Ambas this thing [temple], you will

13:21.319 --> 13:25.480
find the same flowers that are champakas and
all those are more there.

13:25.480 --> 13:32.379
Then a kind of a fragrance that She likes
out of a glue called as gulgul.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.089
They have described also about Her.

13:35.089 --> 13:40.389
And that’s the place you find it, nowhere
else.

13:40.389 --> 13:46.419
How the Mother Earth is also keeping those
limitations and those compartments meant for

13:46.419 --> 13:49.149
different, different Goddesses.

13:49.149 --> 13:56.839
So She sits on the lotus, sits.

13:56.839 --> 14:01.620
She sits there and She establishes Herself
there.

14:01.620 --> 14:09.779
Also it means that She sits on the lotuses
of your chakras and She establishes your lotuses.

14:09.779 --> 14:18.249
So, throughout, in all the centres here, it
is the Mahalakshmi power, in different forms

14:18.249 --> 14:21.869
and manifestations [that] works out the opening
of the chakras.

14:21.869 --> 14:28.100
Even here where She becomes Madhyantar, in
the middle, in the little interval, [when]

14:28.100 --> 14:33.319
She becomes, at that time, the power of Shiva,
it is Mahalakshmi.

14:33.319 --> 14:35.680
So the principle is the same, of Mahalakshmi.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.209
What is the principle of Mahalakshmi?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.379
Is the ascent.

14:38.379 --> 14:42.629
She helps the ascent of the Kundalini.

14:42.629 --> 14:47.310
Because when the Kundalini rises there are
so many things to be done to keep the Kundalini

14:47.310 --> 14:54.569
moving upward, not to make her fall down,
to open different chakras at different times,

14:54.569 --> 14:59.920
and what you call the bandhas, are to keep
the central path in such a way that it [the

14:59.920 --> 15:03.739
Kundalini] is pushed up and it is not allowed
to fall down.

15:03.739 --> 15:08.449
All that is done through Mahalakshmi principle.

15:08.449 --> 15:12.680
“Parabrahma swarupini” — She is the
One who is Parabrahma.

15:12.680 --> 15:18.050
She is the One which is the All-pervading
Power.

15:18.050 --> 15:21.389
Because of that we have the knowledge.

15:21.389 --> 15:26.379
Because of that All-pervading Power of God
we get knowledge on our fingertips.

15:26.379 --> 15:32.649
So it acts through your brain as Mahamaya,
through your nerves as boddhas, and all around

15:32.649 --> 15:34.329
you you get the information.

15:34.329 --> 15:43.949
So you become part and parcel of the whole
cosmos and you become a very efficient, already

15:43.949 --> 15:47.389
programmed, computer.

15:47.389 --> 15:54.250
She wears white dress.

15:54.250 --> 16:03.529
Whenever we have [public] programme I wear
white: “Shwetambara dhare Devi” — She

16:03.529 --> 16:04.749
wears [white].

16:04.749 --> 16:10.680
That’s the time I have to give Realisation,
so I am Mahalakshmi.

16:10.680 --> 16:16.910
At the puja time I am Mahakali or Adi Shakti.

16:16.910 --> 16:22.139
Mahakali is Adi Shakti…

16:22.139 --> 16:26.059
(break in recording)

16:26.059 --> 16:31.299
…Down to earth personality.

16:31.299 --> 16:37.839
“Jagatstite” — down to earth (practical).

16:37.839 --> 16:43.479
And She is the Mother of the whole universe,
of this world.

16:43.479 --> 16:44.479
So Mahalakshmi.

16:44.479 --> 16:56.329
Now, these two others [verses] are those who
read these stotras, these mantras about Nirmala

16:56.329 --> 17:15.880
Devi and do it with complete dedication, they
get all kinds of siddhis which are never lost.

17:15.880 --> 17:28.730
They get the Kingdom of God forever.

17:28.730 --> 17:36.150
The one who reads it once, it removes all
your sins.

17:36.150 --> 17:49.380
Those who read it twice get into dhyana, into
samadhi state — only twice!

17:49.380 --> 18:00.950
If you read it three times, anyone who is
anti-God and troubling you gets destroyed.

18:00.950 --> 18:05.080
Sahaja Yogi: We did it only twice Shri Mataji!

18:05.080 --> 18:20.070
Shri Mataji: You have done it already twice
ah?

18:20.070 --> 18:22.789
(laughter)

18:22.789 --> 18:37.730
So, the one who becomes Nirmala Devi, means
who cleanses out, becomes an auspicious person,

18:37.730 --> 18:41.590
becomes auspicious — shubha.

18:41.590 --> 18:59.350
Because She’s the one, she gets prasanna,
over-pleased, She’s over-pleased and that’s

18:59.350 --> 19:11.179
how She gives you blessings and you become
auspicious, because you are clean in heart,

19:11.179 --> 19:20.950
there isn’t any ego, there isn’t any conditioning,
you have a very clean attention and clean

19:20.950 --> 19:23.860
heart.

19:23.860 --> 19:31.710
It’s the same now repeated, is the “Namastestu
Mahamaye, Shri peethe sura pujite.

19:31.710 --> 19:36.889
Shanka chakra gada haste, Shri Nirmala Devi
Namostute."

19:36.889 --> 19:48.730
It is a very, I should say, a precise, scientific
study.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.970
Even when you take names.

19:50.970 --> 19:57.159
I am amazed at these people, those who have
written.

19:57.159 --> 20:00.120
I don’t know how.

20:00.120 --> 20:08.320
Like the mantras in the puja.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.440
What a description!

20:10.440 --> 20:17.549
You start wondering what Divine eyes they
must have had.

20:17.549 --> 20:27.149
I think at least your eyes should develop
to that state where you see those mantras.

20:27.149 --> 20:33.000
We don’t have to create, but see that reflection,
if it is true or not.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.450
It looks very fantastic but it’s a fact.

20:38.450 --> 20:42.990
Some of the mantras really, it’s surprising
how they know!

20:42.990 --> 20:45.850
I myself don’t know how they found it out!

20:45.850 --> 20:47.309
(laughter).

20:47.309 --> 20:53.429
But their discoveries show their depth, their
love, their dedication and understanding of

20:53.429 --> 20:54.940
what I am.

20:54.940 --> 21:05.169
Of course, at this stage I am a Mahamaya:
rather difficult, but still try.

21:05.169 --> 21:20.460
Also intellectuals, the so-called intellectuals,
are the people, I think, who would walk backwards.

21:20.460 --> 21:23.830
They can’t see the front.

21:23.830 --> 21:27.659
If you walk backwards what do you see?

21:27.659 --> 21:32.590
The reality is going out from you backwards.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.451
It’s very difficult to talk to them.

21:34.451 --> 21:40.529
They always find something that is very surprisingly
funny to me.

21:40.529 --> 21:44.860
But those who have the inner side [developed]
they see it so precisely, so clearly.

21:44.860 --> 21:47.320
I mean, these were written long time back.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.450
Of course, this one is written by Adi Shankaracharya.

21:50.450 --> 21:53.210
But thousands of years back they have written
things.

21:53.210 --> 21:59.559
Like Markandeya, he has described my knees,
can you imagine?

21:59.559 --> 22:06.769
He must have crawled up to my knees to see
or what?

22:06.769 --> 22:09.159
It’s exactly the same.

22:09.159 --> 22:13.570
And here he says there are three folds, it’s
a fact.

22:13.570 --> 22:20.539
All the time I have three folds, which human
beings don’t have: one on here, another

22:20.539 --> 22:22.230
here, another here.

22:22.230 --> 22:23.230
I have to have.

22:23.230 --> 22:28.759
The eyebrows are described, everything.

22:28.759 --> 22:31.639
It’s surprising.

22:31.639 --> 22:39.539
They never saw me, I think, otherwise.

22:39.539 --> 22:49.650
I didn’t exist before, as manifested, on
this Earth, but they saw me all right, especially

22:49.650 --> 22:50.650
Markandeya.

22:50.650 --> 22:58.150
When you go to this Vani, you have been to,
the temple of Saptashringi — Saptashringi

22:58.150 --> 23:01.060
means ‘which has got seven peaks’.

23:01.060 --> 23:14.090
It’s all right with me if I speak English
but [for] translation I am very bad.

23:14.090 --> 23:19.789
So the shikaras are the seven chakras, and
that’s the Adi Shakti.

23:19.789 --> 23:26.820
And the face is exactly like mine, with a
thousand hands.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.690
And that is one temple [which] is not yet
spoiled.

23:28.690 --> 23:30.470
But this Mahalakshmi temple is spoiled.

23:30.470 --> 23:34.809
They get all the bhoots: not in front of Her
but at the back.

23:34.809 --> 23:42.809
So we’ll have to remove that, and we’ll
manage.

23:42.809 --> 23:49.620
It has nothing to do with a particular religion
or particular thing, it’s the inner understanding,

23:49.620 --> 23:53.769
it’s the inner awakening — which is the
truth.

23:53.769 --> 23:58.649
Now, one can say, “Why didn’t Christ say?”

23:58.649 --> 24:01.290
He did in a way.

24:01.290 --> 24:02.390
He did.

24:02.390 --> 24:07.809
But just see where he was born, where there
was no tradition, no understanding.

24:07.809 --> 24:11.070
He could not say all these things to us, could
he?

24:11.070 --> 24:15.120
Even in India, how many people understand?

24:15.120 --> 24:20.710
I asked so many people, “Why do you sing
this song in the temple of Mahalakshmi when

24:20.710 --> 24:23.340
it is you are taking about Ambe?”

24:23.340 --> 24:24.559
They didn’t know.

24:24.559 --> 24:25.600
Nobody knows.

24:25.600 --> 24:32.169
Even the ones who worshipped, have been there
in that temple, have been their forefathers

24:32.169 --> 24:36.159
and forefathers and forefathers, they don’t
know.

24:36.159 --> 24:38.309
They don’t know.

24:38.309 --> 24:42.360
But at least they have the background.

24:42.360 --> 24:48.669
But what’s the use of the background [of]
which you don’t understand anything?

24:48.669 --> 24:58.850
Like a blind person, whether he stands next
to the flowers or to a donkey, God knows.

24:58.850 --> 25:00.950
Now you are the ones who know.

25:00.950 --> 25:12.160
But still, still we have to see for ourselves.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.160
Many miracles, many things happen.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.140
I hope you see the photographs.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.200
Have they seen the photographs?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.799
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

25:20.799 --> 25:24.299
Shri Mataji: All of you have seen?

25:24.299 --> 25:32.030
Have you seen the Deities?

25:32.030 --> 25:35.120
Yogis: No.

25:35.120 --> 25:39.760
Shri Mataji: No?

25:39.760 --> 25:49.040
Oh God, where is it Gavin?

25:49.040 --> 25:53.679
That’s very convincing!

25:53.679 --> 25:58.080
Now, there are photographs that have come
out.

25:58.080 --> 26:08.220
I am sitting like this and the cloth that
separates the brides and the bridegrooms is

26:08.220 --> 26:09.240
just in.

26:09.240 --> 26:15.020
You can see all the Deities sitting here,
around.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.030
All of them!

26:16.030 --> 26:18.499
Then all the bridegrooms are blessed with
light.

26:18.499 --> 26:22.889
And you see all the arrows, which are described
now, that he sends arrows of love.

26:22.889 --> 26:29.190
Because they are getting married the Cupid
sends his arrows.

26:29.190 --> 26:35.200
Then there are flowers which are Divine flowers,
for the brides.

26:35.200 --> 26:46.570
And the one who is holding also that cloth
has got his Shri Chakra very clearly shown.

26:46.570 --> 26:51.559
And all of you are sitting and on top you
is the light.

26:51.559 --> 26:58.179
If you see it the other way round, it’s
my name written in Arabic!

26:58.179 --> 27:08.450
Also it looks like, a little bit, your cardiograph.

27:08.450 --> 27:11.880
Everybody has light.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.820
Everybody is a realised-soul.

27:14.820 --> 27:17.650
It’s beautiful.

27:17.650 --> 27:25.700
You must see that, and then you will know
your value, you will know your situation and

27:25.700 --> 27:30.450
you will know what you are — you are all
realised-souls; not only realised-souls [but]

27:30.450 --> 27:31.450
Sahaj Yogis!

27:31.450 --> 27:38.749
You know all about chakras, you know how to
raise the Kundalini, you know how to give

27:38.749 --> 27:39.749
Realisation.

27:39.749 --> 27:47.090
Such powerful people never lived on this Earth,
never existed, were never known.

27:47.090 --> 27:49.650
You have entered into the Kingdom of God.

27:49.650 --> 27:55.970
Not only that but you are on the stage and
everybody is looking after you.

27:55.970 --> 28:01.400
You should see these photographs and you will
be convinced about it.

28:01.400 --> 28:08.240
These were taken by an ordinary student, by
the small camera that you gave him as a present.

28:08.240 --> 28:14.809
He brought and he said, “I can’t understand
what is all this English."

28:14.809 --> 28:16.400
Poor fellow!

28:16.400 --> 28:21.970
Trying to see this way that way.

28:21.970 --> 28:27.290
You all should see it carefully, and then
we’ll enlarge and we’ll send it over to

28:27.290 --> 28:28.290
people.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.290
All the centres must have it.

28:29.290 --> 28:33.499
Have you seen my photographs in the sky?

28:33.499 --> 28:37.700
You’ve seen the photographs of the vibrations
on my house, Pratisthan.

28:37.700 --> 28:45.879
But these are very remarkable photographs
I must say.

28:45.879 --> 28:51.779
They should convince you of your powers, of
you greatness, that you are very different,

28:51.779 --> 29:00.409
special people and you have to live like special
people, not to be bowed down by useless things

29:00.409 --> 29:03.020
like, “My wife is like this!”

29:03.020 --> 29:06.519
“My husband like this,” “My child like
this."

29:06.519 --> 29:13.029
Who are your brothers and sisters?

29:13.029 --> 29:22.690
Gyaneshwara has said, “They are all going
to be related."

29:22.690 --> 29:24.769
“Soyeri ka hote."

29:24.769 --> 29:28.220
“They will all be related.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.659
Those who are in heaven.

29:30.659 --> 29:31.659
They are the oceans.

29:31.659 --> 29:43.399
Each one of them is the speaking ocean of
ambrosa.

29:43.399 --> 29:53.010
And they are the great forests of boon giving
trees."

29:53.010 --> 29:54.549
That’s you!

29:54.549 --> 29:57.769
He describes you like that.

29:57.769 --> 30:01.480
I mean, He never exaggerated.

30:01.480 --> 30:14.769
He says, “Come along, you are the forests
of boon giving trees."

30:14.769 --> 30:22.010
So let’s start one by one ahh?

30:22.010 --> 30:23.169
Haa!

30:23.169 --> 30:27.749
Also you see the angels.

30:27.749 --> 30:34.350
So first one with the Deities.

30:34.350 --> 30:40.090
I am looking like a heart in the centre and
the rest of them are sitting behind me as

30:40.090 --> 30:41.090
Deities.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.090
You can all have it together, to see.

30:42.090 --> 30:47.389
This is the first one.

30:47.389 --> 30:52.520
All right.

30:52.520 --> 31:17.899
Now, here goes the second one where you find
the angels with their wings.

31:17.899 --> 31:25.309
Pass it on.

31:25.309 --> 31:35.030
Now, these are the arrows of love.

31:35.030 --> 31:46.470
Pass it on.

31:46.470 --> 31:50.289
(laughter).

31:50.289 --> 32:05.590
Now these are the blessings on the bridegrooms.

32:05.590 --> 32:15.740
Now here I look like a white pitcher and here
are all the vibrations coming out from me.

32:15.740 --> 32:16.869
The white one is me.

32:16.869 --> 32:26.590
First see the Deities ones.

32:26.590 --> 32:29.380
You see, one by one [the] series you must
see.

32:29.380 --> 32:32.330
If you see it the other way round.

32:32.330 --> 32:36.269
Now here are the brides blessed by Divine
flowers.

32:36.269 --> 33:05.899
This is the Shri Chakra of the person who
was holding that cloth.

33:05.899 --> 33:25.909
This is my name written on top of your heads,
if you see the other way round you can see,

33:25.909 --> 33:30.210
if you know Arabic.

33:30.210 --> 33:31.279
Everyone.

33:31.279 --> 33:39.739
I have always told you that the vibrations
are like half commas, like the moon of the

33:39.739 --> 33:40.830
first day.

33:40.830 --> 33:47.120
And you see me, a bundle of vibrations.

33:47.120 --> 33:53.419
Yogi: It is [written] ‘Allah’, is God’s
name.

33:53.419 --> 33:57.429
Shri Mataji: But if you put it like this,
it is my name.

33:57.429 --> 33:59.619
You see it is ‘Nir-mala’.

33:59.619 --> 34:01.460
And ‘Allah’ otherwise, you see.

34:01.460 --> 34:07.970
‘Allah’ if you see it from this side,
and from this side is ‘Nirmala’.

34:07.970 --> 34:11.669
Yogi: Oh!!!

34:11.669 --> 34:13.520
(applause).

34:13.520 --> 34:22.770
Shri Mataji: ‘Allah’ is Viraata.

34:22.770 --> 34:27.809
This is the one where Hanumana was sitting
before me.

34:27.809 --> 34:37.309
I see all that but you don’t see, that’s
[what] the trouble is.

34:37.309 --> 34:44.690
Yogis: (laughter)

34:44.690 --> 35:02.319
Shri Mataji: These are the two names [sides]
of one coin: one is ‘Nirmala’ the other

35:02.319 --> 35:03.640
is ‘Allah’.

35:03.640 --> 35:11.270
Also it is ‘Nirmala’ and ‘Sadashiva’.

35:11.270 --> 35:20.090
Also it is ‘Nirmala’ and ‘Brahmadeva’.

35:20.090 --> 35:30.210
So Allah is the same as Jehovah.

35:30.210 --> 35:37.460
Pass it on to others to see.

35:37.460 --> 35:44.230
We’ll have to make it big and we’ll get
them enlarged, isn’t it Gavin?

35:44.230 --> 36:23.069
This one is missing where the bullock carts
are.

36:23.069 --> 36:41.630
So the muslims must have some sense in there
heads that’s why it is in Arabic.

36:41.630 --> 36:51.609
They are the blindest people you can ever
think of, fanatics: this madman Khomeini.

36:51.609 --> 36:53.109
He was dying, still he’s surviving.

36:53.109 --> 36:54.620
He should not feel happy when he’s dying.

36:54.620 --> 36:55.620
Let him die!

36:55.620 --> 37:56.609
Can I have them (the photographs) back?

37:56.609 --> 37:57.640
The ladies have seen?

37:57.640 --> 38:00.750
All of you pass it that side first of all.

38:00.750 --> 38:01.940
If somebody has not seen all of these?

38:01.940 --> 39:08.540
The last and not the least: this is for all
of you to understand that leadership is a

39:08.540 --> 39:09.670
myth.

39:09.670 --> 39:13.350
There’s nobody like a leader in the Kingdom
of God.

39:13.350 --> 39:23.960
It’s not that a leader will be asked to
go first inside.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.329
Nothing of the kind! (laughter)

39:26.329 --> 39:31.089
But the worst are the leaders wives, they
start thinking themselves to be leaders.

39:31.089 --> 39:33.530
They are the worst of all.

39:33.530 --> 39:36.450
Don’t treat the wives of leaders as leaders.

39:36.450 --> 39:47.710
And they have no business to guide anyone
or to tell anyone.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.599
Be very careful on that point!

39:49.599 --> 39:54.630
All such wives I don’t know where they’ll
end up.

39:54.630 --> 39:59.609
It’s very common [that] those women who
have nothing in them try to bask in the glory

39:59.609 --> 40:01.580
of their husbands.

40:01.580 --> 40:05.289
You see so many prime ministers are like that,
their wives.

40:05.289 --> 40:17.170
So many of them we have had: Mrs Kennedy we
have had, Mao Tse Tung’s wife, we had the

40:17.170 --> 40:26.820
wife of Chanta Sheik, of this Carlos also
of this…

40:26.820 --> 40:30.960
Yogi: Mrs.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.030
Marcos.

40:33.030 --> 40:48.720
Shri Mataji: You see the wives of leaders
must keep themselves as non-identities.

40:48.720 --> 41:02.320
Any woman who tries such things will harm
the whole organisation.

41:02.320 --> 41:06.900
Like people say Nancy Reagan rules her husband.

41:06.900 --> 41:07.900
Imagine!

41:07.900 --> 41:10.010
Shameful thing she does.

41:10.010 --> 41:13.460
Ambav’s wife ruined him, that’s what they
say.

41:13.460 --> 41:17.640
I mean everywhere they talk about this kind
of a thing.

41:17.640 --> 41:23.250
So no leader’s wife is to be treated like
a leader by any chance!

41:23.250 --> 41:26.109
Not to be given any importance.

41:26.109 --> 41:29.600
And they are to be put down in their own places.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.910
First of all they think they work very hard.

41:32.910 --> 41:35.410
God knows what work they do!

41:35.410 --> 41:36.890
They think no end of themselves.

41:36.890 --> 41:38.520
They have to work very hard like all others.

41:38.520 --> 41:44.650
They are like all other women, they are not
to have any special position.

41:44.650 --> 41:48.790
That’s the sign of a real Sahaj Yogini.

41:48.790 --> 41:58.340
You’ll be amazed, though I am Adi Shakti,
I never go into my husband’s office; never,

41:58.340 --> 42:02.950
never telephone to him, never use anyone from
his office.

42:02.950 --> 42:10.660
Nor do I to any one of his people, whatever
may be the difficulty, whether I have Sahaja

42:10.660 --> 42:12.490
Yoga or not.

42:12.490 --> 42:17.360
And this I have done all my life.

42:17.360 --> 42:22.080
I never preach Sahaja Yoga in any one of his
offices.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.180
Anybody from his offices I said, “Keep out!

42:24.180 --> 42:31.750
You are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga till my
husband is working with you."

42:31.750 --> 42:38.630
And if I telephone to him he thinks I must
have met with an accident!

42:38.630 --> 42:42.120
He gets so upset.

42:42.120 --> 42:51.150
But to bask in the glory of a father or husband
is a sign of a woman who doesn’t have any

42:51.150 --> 42:54.980
personality: she must be a useless woman,
absolutely.

42:54.980 --> 42:58.140
Show no special respect for such women!

42:58.140 --> 43:04.940
They must stand in their own dignity like
all other Sahaj Yoginis are.

43:04.940 --> 43:12.339
They have no business to take any decision
as wives of the leaders.

43:12.339 --> 43:17.859
They have to be humble, intelligent.

43:17.859 --> 43:21.760
They have to work hard.

43:21.760 --> 43:25.740
I have to do a lot of work for my husband:
I cook for his friends, I clean his ships.

43:25.740 --> 43:31.589
Such a lot of things I have done for him.

43:31.589 --> 43:34.059
I have decorated his ships.

43:34.059 --> 43:36.619
Whatever type of work he has done.

43:36.619 --> 43:40.700
I have to feed his clerks and his chaprasis
(junior office worker), his peons.

43:40.700 --> 43:42.900
Everything I have done, lots of things.

43:42.900 --> 43:46.299
But never, never once I asked [for anything].

43:46.299 --> 43:51.970
I have to bring presents for his secretaries
and other people.

43:51.970 --> 44:01.289
I think before Christmas I have to give presents
to all of them but never, never asked the

44:01.289 --> 44:13.450
driver even to bring the car or even to bring
the medicine or even to bring the letter which

44:13.450 --> 44:16.110
has arrived.

44:16.110 --> 44:18.849
That should be the attitude, that’s a sign
of your dignity.

44:18.849 --> 44:22.440
You are not here because you are somebody’s
wife!

44:22.440 --> 44:27.640
You are here because you are a Sahaja Yogi
and a Sahaja Yogini.

44:27.640 --> 44:31.160
All these complications come because your
attention is more on the husband or the wife

44:31.160 --> 44:39.940
and not on me, and you don’t love me enough.

44:39.940 --> 44:41.930
If you love me you will know me very well.

44:41.930 --> 44:46.690
Like the people who have known me, they only
loved me.

44:46.690 --> 44:52.140
And I don’t gain anything out of your love,
you have to gain something by loving me.

44:52.140 --> 44:57.670
This is the last message I give you.

44:57.670 --> 45:05.010
Horrible things I have seen happening to leaders
— and to different ashrams and different

45:05.010 --> 45:11.710
cities and different countries — because
the wife is a negative woman.

45:11.710 --> 45:15.880
And negativity always goes through the wives.

45:15.880 --> 45:22.230
Always you will find politicians attacked
through their children, through their wives,

45:22.230 --> 45:24.630
through somebody else.

45:24.630 --> 45:29.910
And the leaders must put them down in their
own places.

45:29.910 --> 45:40.650
You must have seen when my daughter came and
I asked her to come on the stage, she would

45:40.650 --> 45:41.690
not.

45:41.690 --> 45:52.109
I had to tell her, “At least come in front!”

45:52.109 --> 45:55.240
She would not.

45:55.240 --> 46:01.369
Always the wives are more susceptible, vulnerable
to negativity, so they have to be extremely

46:01.369 --> 46:03.099
careful.

46:03.099 --> 46:07.380
They should not take any decisions.

46:07.380 --> 46:15.609
I have seen if they are miserly wives, horrid
they are, horrid.

46:15.609 --> 46:21.210
The leaders are there because of their own
position, not because of their wives by any

46:21.210 --> 46:22.210
chance.

46:22.210 --> 46:26.700
In this I am muslim I think.

46:26.700 --> 46:31.930
If it’s a lady who is the leader, she should
not look at her husbands face all the time,

46:31.930 --> 46:34.240
what he has to say.

46:34.240 --> 46:45.049
She should behave like a leader and should
not praise her husband beyond a certain point:

46:45.049 --> 46:50.902
he doesn’t matter in Sahaj Yoga.

46:50.902 --> 46:51.902
All right?

46:51.902 --> 46:52.902
I hope you understand.

46:52.902 --> 46:59.480
The women are the power behind the man and
they are not the manifestation of the power

46:59.480 --> 47:01.920
of their husbands.

47:01.920 --> 47:07.700
They have to give power to their husbands
and not to use his powers for their own use.

47:07.700 --> 47:17.130
It’s a sign of a person who is very low
level and has no self-respect.

47:17.130 --> 47:23.849
There are many subtle ways by [which] they
assert themselves, so be very careful, very,

47:23.849 --> 47:25.930
very careful.

47:25.930 --> 47:32.740
All the Sahaj Yogis must also remember that
your husbands or wives should not guide you

47:32.740 --> 47:35.450
in Sahaj Yog.

47:35.450 --> 47:42.660
Another point is that, in the name of ‘love’
you go on hugging each other: please don’t

47:42.660 --> 47:43.660
do it!

47:43.660 --> 47:45.140
The Kundalini gets affected.

47:45.140 --> 47:46.589
Kissing each other.

47:46.589 --> 47:50.740
It’s all right men can hug men, women can
hug women.

47:50.740 --> 47:53.190
But not too much of it [is] also not so good.

47:53.190 --> 47:57.180
Maybe a bhoot does that more because she wants
to pass on bhoots into your body.

47:57.180 --> 47:58.180
Better to keep out.

47:58.180 --> 48:01.890
But the kissing business must be stopped immediately.

48:01.890 --> 48:05.910
I mean, this French style of kissing everybody
is horrid!

48:05.910 --> 48:07.190
You get a shock you know.

48:07.190 --> 48:17.890
Any time you meet a French man you don’t
know where he is going to kiss you.

48:17.890 --> 48:23.380
These are our private things, whom to kiss,
whom not to kiss.

48:23.380 --> 48:29.309
How can we be exposed to every person like
that?

48:29.309 --> 48:33.849
Even children should not be kissed much, and
if you have to kiss, kiss on their hands and

48:33.849 --> 48:34.849
on their heads.

48:34.849 --> 48:46.020
Then in the name of affection, love and compassion
we go to bhoots.

48:46.020 --> 48:53.440
Now if somebody is sick, say, with AIDS you
have nothing to do with that person.

48:53.440 --> 48:57.109
Anybody who is sick you don’t have to do
anything with that sick person: give my photograph,

48:57.109 --> 48:58.109
I’ll look after.

48:58.109 --> 49:05.040
You don’t have to go and cure anybody who
is sick because you have compassion.

49:05.040 --> 49:12.510
You don’t have more compassion than I have
and I don’t believe in small families of

49:12.510 --> 49:16.940
husband, wife and one and a half child.

49:16.940 --> 49:23.140
I believe and you should also believe, which
is the truth, in the largest family, the big

49:23.140 --> 49:29.330
family, where we are all part and parcel,
children of one Mother.

49:29.330 --> 49:36.770
So don’t waste your attention on your family
business — you’ll never grow.

49:36.770 --> 49:41.230
First you didn’t believe in family, you
didn’t believe in your children.

49:41.230 --> 49:45.420
Now you believe too much in your family, too
much in your children.

49:45.420 --> 49:51.360
It’s just the same, what difference does
it make?

49:51.360 --> 49:55.900
Whether you are in the pitcher or in the river,
it’s just the same: you are in the water

49:55.900 --> 49:58.190
isn’t it.

49:58.190 --> 50:07.640
So we don’t believe in this kind of a small
family affairs, “My wife, my son, my this."

50:07.640 --> 50:15.789
These limitations must be broken and you must
think yourself to be a Sahaj Yogi first and

50:15.789 --> 50:17.420
last.

50:17.420 --> 50:21.880
Of course by the way you have a husband, by
the way you have a wife, by the way you have

50:21.880 --> 50:27.589
children, but they shouldn’t form a major
part of your life.

50:27.589 --> 50:33.480
Your Spirit is the major part and the only
part that you have.

50:33.480 --> 50:37.880
The rest of it is just by the way.

50:37.880 --> 50:45.680
If they are realised-souls, if they are Sahaj
Yogis [then] all right, they are with you.

50:45.680 --> 50:52.130
Now, the last of the last, [is] that when
girls come from India you don’t think they

50:52.130 --> 50:53.460
are all goddesses.

50:53.460 --> 50:56.500
Don’t pamper them!

50:56.500 --> 51:01.380
Don’t tell them that they are great: “You
look very beautiful."

51:01.380 --> 51:06.380
You see, one girl came to Italy and all the
people said, “You are a classical beauty."

51:06.380 --> 51:07.700
Can you imagine?

51:07.700 --> 51:10.190
And this ‘classical beauty’ could not
get married for thirty-eight years!

51:10.190 --> 51:14.070
And she really believed it [that] she was
a ‘classical beauty’.

51:14.070 --> 51:17.329
I don’t know what she thought of herself.

51:17.329 --> 51:21.770
And ultimately she became mad, she made her
husband mad.

51:21.770 --> 51:23.609
So don’t treat them like goddesses.

51:23.609 --> 51:25.040
They are Indians, so what?

51:25.040 --> 51:27.740
They are just like you — nothing so special!

51:27.740 --> 51:34.049
But when they come here you try to pamper
them, give them presents, look after them.

51:34.049 --> 51:40.490
Then they become naughty, they become rude
and then you become unhappy.

51:40.490 --> 51:42.599
Treat them just like any other woman.

51:42.599 --> 51:49.000
Especially women they lose their heads very
fast.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.660
In India they are not treated like that once
they are married.

51:51.660 --> 51:55.600
And big, big problems you have caused me.

51:55.600 --> 52:01.000
There’s one lady who came to France: you
made such an ado out of her, now I don’t

52:01.000 --> 52:02.059
know what to do with her.

52:02.059 --> 52:05.290
The husband doesn’t want her, the father
can’t look after her.

52:05.290 --> 52:08.390
Another one came to Switzerland, another horrid
one.

52:08.390 --> 52:13.130
And they know how to handle you now and they
know how to frighten you.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.160
Keep them down!

52:15.160 --> 52:21.710
I’m allowing you even to give them two slaps
if they misbehave.

52:21.710 --> 52:24.810
Because they come from India they don’t
become something great.

52:24.810 --> 52:26.539
They are human beings, you are human beings.

52:26.539 --> 52:29.390
They are Sahaj Yogis, you are Sahaj Yogis.

52:29.390 --> 52:31.630
Don’t spoil their heads.

52:31.630 --> 52:34.070
Don’t give them special treatment.

52:34.070 --> 52:38.039
They are just like all other Sahaj Yogis.

52:38.039 --> 52:45.670
It’s very surprising: it has caused me so
much of trouble.

52:45.670 --> 52:51.549
Some of them are quite negative, left-sided.

52:51.549 --> 52:56.589
Be careful!

52:56.589 --> 53:01.630
Very left-sided.

53:01.630 --> 53:04.230
And some of them are very right-sided too.

53:04.230 --> 53:11.789
So it’s not proper also [because] then we
have to leave them alone and then it’s a

53:11.789 --> 53:19.960
bad name for us in Sahaj Yoga.

53:19.960 --> 53:30.930
Treat them just like ordinary people and immediately
they start showing off you let me know.

53:30.930 --> 53:31.930
This is very important.

53:31.930 --> 53:34.280
There are some very sensible women from India.

53:34.280 --> 53:38.500
I would say Chaya is one, who had come here,
Regis’s wife.

53:38.500 --> 53:40.260
She is very, very sensible.

53:40.260 --> 53:47.339
Yes, we have some very sensible, very, very
matured women, but also stupid [ones].

53:47.339 --> 53:49.190
Some of them have no background.

53:49.190 --> 53:51.609
They come from very poor families sometimes.

53:51.609 --> 53:55.510
Sometimes they come from families where they
have suffered a lot and suddenly their heads

53:55.510 --> 53:58.079
go off, so be careful.

53:58.079 --> 54:02.230
Some of them are from rich families so their
heads are off!

54:02.230 --> 54:05.099
Keep them into balance.

54:05.099 --> 54:07.750
I think you have some problem there?
