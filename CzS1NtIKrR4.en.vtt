00:07.717 --> 00:13.123
So now, let’s have it, the second question. Now what is it?

00:14.022 --> 00:17.459
Yogi: Mother, how can we please you best?

00:20.482 --> 00:24.256
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Gregoire: How can we please you best?

00:29.670 --> 00:31.639
I have no desires.

00:34.311 --> 00:35.748
I don’t know

00:50.319 --> 00:55.905
You see, inside me is complete peace and complete satisfaction.

01:03.295 --> 01:07.451
There is nothing that is needed inside.

01:10.397 --> 01:17.233
But the ripples of that joy flows outward all the time.

01:22.272 --> 01:27.295
And when it reaches your shores, you see, it comes back.

01:31.592 --> 01:35.295
And it weaves a beautiful pattern,

01:39.960 --> 01:42.279
and I see the pattern.

01:43.905 --> 01:47.873
The reciprocity, how much you reciprocate,

01:51.959 --> 01:55.733
is the way the pattern is beautiful.

02:03.662 --> 02:06.780
It’s delicate, it’s powerful.

02:10.741 --> 02:12.584
It’s so soothing

02:17.162 --> 02:22.500
and it weaves the complete beauty of bhakti.

02:30.787 --> 02:38.333
So much so that this ocean of joy itself gets turbulent,

02:44.342 --> 02:46.943
and I really swing with it.

02:51.162 --> 02:53.748
And it is not easy to describe

02:56.205 --> 03:01.000
that beautiful feeling of tremendous joy.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.553
The first thing you have to know

03:11.553 --> 03:13.967
that I love you very much,

03:17.201 --> 03:20.100
with all my heart, with all my soul.

03:23.936 --> 03:27.115
In the same way try to love me

03:30.024 --> 03:32.398
with all sincerity and trust.

03:36.898 --> 03:38.742
May God bless you all!
