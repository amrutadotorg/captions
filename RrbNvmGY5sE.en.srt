1
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,960
I’ll try to cover most of the points that
you have asked but I must say that I was very

2
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,219
happy to hear most of the questions because
that shows that your enquiry is getting subtler

3
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:58,950
and subtler; that you already know about the
gross side of chakras and now you want to

4
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:10,409
know the subtler forms.
Now the first question which should be taken

5
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:18,030
up first, is the one, “How the chakras come
into human beings? What time? What stage of

6
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:29,210
life?” because that should be the first
question. This question is something like

7
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:35,400
if we ask, “What time a primule comes into
the being of a seed?” is something like

8
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,219
that. That a human being when he dies – as
I have told you before he does not die fully

9
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:54,250
– only a part of him dies which is mostly
the earth element and the rest of the elements

10
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:11,230
remain there. The rest of the body disappears
and we can’t see it because it is not a

11
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:26,489
complete human form. It goes on decreasing
in size and the Kundalini leaves the body

12
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:41,620
and stays outside, outside the body. And the
Atma, what we call the Spirit, also leaves

13
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:51,290
the body, and stays outside the body, which
is the remaining body.

14
00:02:51,290 --> 00:03:00,799
The constitution of this new body is different
from our constitution. We can say a light

15
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:11,540
that is extinguished has all the body except
for the light. But the light goes out of that

16
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:22,209
body now. In the same way, in a human being
who dies, the Spirit and the Kundalini leave

17
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:33,739
the body, but they are around that body. And
it’s a great procedure that follows which

18
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:45,010
is fantastic. It’s unbelievable how the
body disappears, into different elements also.

19
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:54,819
But first of all let us see; when such bodies
which remain like that, they go into what

20
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:04,299
you call the Pretalok. There they become seeds
or they become smaller and smaller and smaller.

21
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:21,840
Till one body forms an ova and what you know
as a sperm. In one body it is formed. I don’t

22
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,490
know if you have seen the division of chromosomes
how it takes place? It’s a complete division.

23
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,129
If the chromosome is like that, it’s a complete
vertical division and a complete separation

24
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:53,819
takes place. That is why marriages and selection
of partners, all these have a great place.

25
00:04:53,819 --> 00:05:02,610
For ordinary bodies it does not matter for
the Divine; they take place in such a manner

26
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:17,460
that there can be at random connections established.
For example an ova of one may combine with

27
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:25,370
the sperm of another. It happens at a very
lower stage of evolution; among human beings

28
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:36,689
also it happens like that. For some people
who are just not very evolved, we can say.

29
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:49,110
But mostly the ova rejects the sperms. It
only except that sperm which is meant to be

30
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:56,780
accepted. Now it is such a minute work. It
is so fantastic that it is unbelievable. We

31
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,020
have no idea as to how God works out in those.
It’s absolutely tremendous that even the

32
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:16,800
ova, rejects, goes on rejecting the sperm
that is not the second part of itself! And

33
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,939
that’s how so many sperms are wasted and
so many ova’s are wasted.

34
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:30,270
So you can imagine that there is a tremendous
machinery, which is working out this. Specially

35
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:38,050
people who are realised if, when they are
reborn, all the forces of the Divine combine

36
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:47,680
to see that these, this ova is placed with
a person who is ultimately going to meet the

37
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:58,039
person who has the proper sperm, so that there
is no problem as far as the meeting is concerned.

38
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,150
And the Divine takes all the care of these
great souls.

39
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:16,599
The 
work of the Divine is very, very fantastic
and it is beyond human conception to understand

40
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:24,770
how the awareness of God can look after all
the minute small things of the world.

41
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,789
You cannot do even a small thing like attaching
this to this one unless and until you pay

42
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:38,400
some human attention. So you can imagine the
attention of God who embeds so many seeds

43
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,300
in this Mother Earth and gives you such huge,
big trees. I mean, you have taken them for

44
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,729
granted, but if you watch you will see this
Fantastic, Dynamic Force behind it also, which

45
00:07:52,729 --> 00:08:00,710
thinks it, which does it so perfectly. But
we think that it is all automatic and that’s

46
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:06,629
how we can bear it, and that’s how we can
bear Sahaj yoga also, thinking that it is

47
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:13,580
all automatic.
The second question is, “When did the chakras

48
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,520
that are in the body [get] embedded?” They
exist in the body and they go on existing.

49
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:28,210
Of course they get corrected every time the
body takes birth and goes into a new seeking.

50
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:37,750
And the Kundalini also, every birth you are
born, is watching you as to what you are doing,

51
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:45,839
how your chakras are developing, how it is
working out. And through the method of balancing

52
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:55,279
you or [your] parasympathetic system or you
can call universal unconscious, the chakras

53
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:07,220
are brought to its proper shape and to its
proper condition by evolution.

54
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,680
A man makes mistakes he makes searches, he
searches from one place to another. For example,

55
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:22,560
he may start his search in money, then he
starts his search in power then he starts

56
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,730
his search in love, I mean the carnal love,
or he may start his search some emotional

57
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:38,870
expressions, then in art and all those things:
ultimately he finds that the search has not

58
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:46,300
been alright because he has not been able
to achieve any state of joyous existence.

59
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,589
And with his search these chakras go on evolving
and understanding.

60
00:09:50,589 --> 00:10:03,339
Now we have to know that these chakras are
absolutely living entities. Because when a

61
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:15,290
person is supposed to be dead, that time,
all the Deities are not in the working state.

62
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:27,209
But the living man has the chakras, which
has got the Deities, which work out the different

63
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:37,759
functions of the chakras and it’s a very,
very subtle working and these can be called

64
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:48,860
as the reflecting mirrors at different levels
of our awareness where the Deities, which

65
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:57,070
are placed in the Primordial Being, the Viraata,
are reflected and they, once awakened, start

66
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:09,620
working out the plans of the Divine.
In some of the human beings, when they are

67
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:24,730
searching, these chakras find that the person
or the subject is going to the extremes of

68
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:36,079
things and this comes because a human being
has got freedom to choose. And in his freedom

69
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:44,610
he goes to the extremes, and by going to the
extremes the chakras get damaged. Going to

70
00:11:44,610 --> 00:12:01,720
the extremes is what we call is ‘sin’.
To be in the centre, to lead a moderate, simple

71
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:15,910
balanced life and stick to the values of our
sustenance is the best life, but if you start

72
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:24,649
going to the extremes then the sin starts.
And the sin…in the Bible it is written that,

73
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:33,269
“The wages of sin is death.” So the death
occurs. Now the death actually, you know,

74
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:41,029
doesn’t take place but what happens is that
the part of the chakra gets damaged. It can

75
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:46,009
be a physical hankering, it can be mental,
it can be emotional, it can be spiritual,

76
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:58,910
it can be anything. If you go on working out
an imbalanced solution then these chakras

77
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:11,810
get spoilt at different points. That’s how
your chakras get spoilt.

78
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:27,860
The chakras are, according to our awareness,
in different states. For example for a doctor

79
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:37,120
or for all of us, we know that we have plexuses
in our body, we know we have different plexuses.

80
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,899
Like you can say pelvic plexus, we have got
solar plexus, we’ve got aortic plexus, we

81
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:53,129
have got cardiac plexus, we have got cervical
plexus, we have got optic chiasma, we’ve

82
00:13:53,129 --> 00:14:01,569
got limbic area to act, or we can say pituitary
and pineal bodies at optic chiasma, and then

83
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:06,019
we have got limbic area where we have got
certain points which are active. This every

84
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:11,829
doctor knows because they have even tested
the limbic area of some monkeys and they found

85
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:20,319
that if you excite the limbic area of the
monkeys, with electricity, they feel very

86
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:27,490
joyous.
So all these chakras, in the body of a human

87
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:34,480
being, are only felt as gross expressions,
which we call as ‘plexuses’ in the parasympathetic

88
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,399
and sympathetic channels. They are all connected
as I have told you, that the sympathetic comes

89
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,440
from both the sides and creates the central
channel, and that is the parasympathetic.

90
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,699
So it depends on the balance of both these
sympathetics that the parasympathetic works

91
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:59,279
out well. When the balance breaks up any balance
can upset both of them, and when it is completely

92
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,980
broken then they become on their own, and
that is how it is the complete so-called,

93
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,259
‘liberation’ of man from Gods grace.
Once he’s completely liberated from that

94
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:20,839
thing he starts falling into the state of,
as you call them rakshasas. He goes to hell,

95
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:29,670
he goes to the other kind of awareness where
there is no feeling, no consciousness of conscience.

96
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:36,620
He doesn’t think twice. He can kill a hundred
people without even feeling bad about it.

97
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:46,170
He loses all his emotional side and also he
loses all his wisdom. What remains in him

98
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:55,209
is his own ambitions and his own desires or
his ??. And he goes on without feeling any

99
00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:04,029
compunction or any binding from the Divine
or his own dharma.

100
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:14,569
So these chakras are very important for us
because, first of all, they give us the balance

101
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:26,160
for our everyday existence. They give us…
(break in recording)…God, and we can think

102
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,949
of subtle things and abstract things. This
all comes through the help of the chakras.

103
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:40,970
If you ask Me if the animals have the chakras
– they have. But they don’t have all of

104
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,120
them separated, sometimes they are confused
chakras and all the chakras are not separated

105
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:58,170
from each other and they are not all opened
out because their evolutionary process is

106
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:08,520
not yet complete. But some animals I have
seen have got an awakened Kundalini and they

107
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:31,570
are realised animals I have seen it. So it
is possible, even for animals, to be very

108
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:37,320
[much more] dharmic than men are. And sometimes
it’s surprising how they can discriminate

109
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:45,190
better than human beings can. Apart from that
animals are kept under the bondage of God

110
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:52,500
and whatever their sustenance is done by them;
they don’t have to think about it. For example

111
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,680
a dog is a dog, a cat is a cat, and a tiger
is a tiger. It’s only the human beings can

112
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:07,060
be a dog, can be a scorpion, can be a snake
and can be a saint. So it’s only a possibility

113
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,740
in the human being that you can find all the
animals existing side by side, and can be

114
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,010
any time [that] these animals can come out
and you may be surprised at yourself the way

115
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:24,830
they suddenly jump out and start barking at
you! So that is what human beings are because

116
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,160
whatever has been in our past is within us;
whatever animals we have been is within us,

117
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,150
so all that is there. But whatever we are
going to be also is there. And whatever we

118
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,620
are going to achieve is also there.
For human beings the future, past, present

119
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,630
exists, but for God it does not. So for Him
to plan and to organise and arrange is a very

120
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,060
easy stuff because if you do not have such
demarcating things you just organise things

121
00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:02,860
much better. And His methods are because of
His own, I should say awareness, status, almightiness,

122
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:10,380
I can say or it’s just His nature that He’s
like that, that He can manage things very

123
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,240
well. And you cannot explain them with one
event after another event, how He has managed

124
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:24,630
and how it has happened. He does it just because
He is capable of doing that. He need not do

125
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,170
it, all that, with understanding or thinking
about it as human beings do because he does

126
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:35,770
not have to think either because He is that.
He is the power and He does everything. He

127
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,500
is the consciousness, so he does everything
without putting any effort into it. And is

128
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,080
a very different state, which perhaps you
can understand, as Sahaja Yogis, that, just

129
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,200
you move your hands and you find the Kundalini
moving the other side! And you may say, “Why

130
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,700
is it moving?” after all, you must think
about it. You are realised so you can do it

131
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,470
but not a person who is not realised; if he
put’s hand like that a hundred times nothing

132
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,420
is going to work out. Only you can raise the
Kundalini. The reason is: your awareness is

133
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,830
different and his awareness is the different;
your powers are different and his powers are

134
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:14,500
different. So, in the same way God who is
All Powerful, for Him even [by] moving His

135
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,440
finger He can move the whole Universe, after
all He is God. And that’s why for human

136
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,230
beings it is said that you better have faith
in God because that’s the best way you can

137
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,370
solve your problem.
If you go on thinking about Him you’ll all

138
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,740
go crazy! So we have to go to a point where
we can understand Him otherwise we will all

139
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,310
go crazy understanding Him (laughing) and
we all will become mad thinking, “What all

140
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:43,510
these things! It’s beyond us, it is too
much!”

141
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:49,970
But because in Sahaja Yoga now your awareness
has come really to such subtler forms, one

142
00:20:49,970 --> 00:21:00,350
can understand so many things and can understand
the subtler ways of God’s doing and also

143
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:09,210
understand what is possible for you through
subtle methods. We can talk on subtler things

144
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,180
but talking this to anybody who is not a Sahaja
Yogi would be something madness! They wouldn’t

145
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:20,080
understand a word that I’m saying. It’s
only meant for the people who are Sahaja Yogis.

146
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,990
So we came to a point where I said that, “In
the gross they are expressed as plexuses in

147
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,710
the human being.” Now this is known as the
gross way. Now the subtle form you have seen,

148
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,690
the sukshma as they call it – the subtle
form. The subtle form exists in the human

149
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,250
being, which you can see – you have seen
it – the subtle form as energy when it starts

150
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:51,760
pulsating, you have seen the pulsation. But
this subtle form is in two forms you can say,

151
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,960
one is a sukshma and [the other is] ati sukshma
(very subtle). Because in the sukshma you

152
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:21,660
can see and a person who is a realised soul,
if you are a realised soul then you see even

153
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:28,550
the chakras, in the sense you can feel the
chakras on your fingers.

154
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:35,710
A unrealised soul can see the pulsation of
the Kundalini and the different chakras with

155
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:43,430
his own eyes, he can, if he watches it clearly
he can see the different chakras clearly.

156
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,680
And you as Sahaja Yogis can feel them on your
fingers and also can feel them within yourself

157
00:22:48,680 --> 00:23:02,440
in the collective consciousness. There is,
you 
can say, in the second stage of sukshma, there

158
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,130
are three stages as you can say: sukshma (सूक्ष्म),
sukshmatara (सूक्ष्मतर – subtler)

159
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,110
and sukshmatam (सूक्ष्मतम
– very subtle, subtlest). These three things

160
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:20,770
you can see. The first stage you see is on
your fingers is the sukshmatara you can say,

161
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:26,500
but with the eyes [what] you see is a sukshma
and if your fingers or on your chakras when

162
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:35,690
you feel it is, you can say, sukshmatam. So
you see them in three forms.

163
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:42,930
If some of the people do not feel it on the
fingers [they] can feel it on the chakras

164
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:53,210
also. So you can feel it in three ways but
there’s a fourth way where you can say it

165
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,050
is in the karana, karana state, that’s a
higher state where a realised soul can feel

166
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:04,330
it, who is born as a realised soul can feel
it. And in that state they just know like

167
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:10,690
a computer. They don’t bother as to which
is the one, and they don’t put hands or

168
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,250
anything, they just feel it, it is so. As
you have seen in my granddaughter’s case,

169
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,720
you see she just knows what is what. Just
see, you ask her, she’ll immediately say,

170
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,060
“This is this, this is this,” like that.
It comes plain to them absolutely, “This

171
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,590
is this.” Now you may say that how do they
know? But this procedure becomes such a compact

172
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,830
thing, I mean it just happens to you, like
[if] you pin prick me here and immediately

173
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,050
the hand goes back. The whole reflex action
is so quick that we can say there’s no procedure

174
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:45,110
as such but it’s just a reflex action. In
the same way it acts as a reflex action; so

175
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,040
that you don’t have to worry about the purpose
of it.

176
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:55,730
That is state where we say the karana state
is reached. And the mahakarana state. Now

177
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,600
this is the third stage is it? And even in
the karana stage there are three stages into

178
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,990
which one feels it. Now that is, I would say
that, I need not explain because that’s

179
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:20,880
beyond you people but if you are born realised
you will understand that imbalance in a personality

180
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,890
of the three gunas is immediately perceived
by a born realised person, immediately perceived!

181
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:31,600
He can see through, you see. That’s the
wisdom he has gained in his previous lives

182
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,370
and previous births and immediately they can
see the imbalance that comes in. And whatever

183
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,890
they say is so wise and they understand because
they can see the imbalance of these three

184
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:47,210
gunas. And according to their own gunas, whichever
are [more] prevalent in them; these three

185
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:55,870
stages exist in them the way they say.
For example some people are more tamogunis:

186
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:01,570
means the ones who are very emotional type
people, among them some are very emotional.

187
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:07,740
So they see a person through the emotions,
the way they feel in themselves. They call

188
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,800
it a feeling. “I had a feeling for such
a person. I felt that way.” That is the

189
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,910
word they use.
But supposing the person is a rajoguni, he

190
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:28,310
has been working on the rajoguna like praying
to Surya and doing Gayatri [mantras] and praying

191
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:35,370
to all the heavenly bodies and also the five
elements, like that. If he has been doing

192
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:41,720
yagyas and all those things he’s a rajoguni.
Such people see them as lights, as electrical

193
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:52,600
forms; so they see them as colours and things.
So one sees it as an emotional thing another

194
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:03,530
sees it as a colour or you can say as any
form. They see them as forms, as colours,

195
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:12,340
lights. They see as electrical currents and
some them as a different flowers.

196
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:26,170
Now they are feelings and also they are these
rajoguni expressions, which you can see with

197
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:33,900
your eye [like] The Creation itself.
But they are also feelings. So those who can

198
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:41,000
see feelings more, a person who has been very
loving and has dealt in this side of life,

199
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,640
who has been a bhakti man, a dedicated man,
who has been praying to God and crying for

200
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:55,900
Him and asking for His help and weeping before
Him with all his heart. Such a man will feel

201
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:04,590
a person more and a person who is a more dedicated
to forms and things will see them in a different

202
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,010
way as forms, so then they see them in colours
because they’re also colours. They’re

203
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:15,900
also colours and they’re also sounds.
So the sound is also one of the elements,

204
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,580
so they can see a sound. And they also see
them when their Kundalini moves, you see,

205
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:32,030
they see the sound moving. Most of the people
who have seen this have been the people who

206
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:37,720
have been meditating through the Patanjali
style of meditation where they were single

207
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,740
people Parashurama style (austere), you see.
And they saw these forms and they saw the

208
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:53,770
movement of the Kundalini through the chakras,
when it passes, it creates a sound, a word.

209
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:59,310
And so they studied every sound how, which
sound was created, what sound was created

210
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:05,740
what colour was there. And so it is the one-sided
knowledge of the right-hand side, of the people

211
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,000
who went to the right-hand side that they
say that, “This thing was created, that

212
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,110
thing was created and then this sound was
created.”

213
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,810
Then they formed the language – it’s the
original Sanskrit language which was formed.

214
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:22,290
That’s why it’s called as a Devavani.
And that’s why these Deities understand

215
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,990
Sanskrit the best. When you say Sanskrit mantras
you see, they absolutely understand them very

216
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,750
fast because this has come originally from
there. They studied that and then it closed

217
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:42,750
off. But other languages in India, most of
the languages, were taken from Sanskrit converted

218
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:47,660
into something else, brought to another form
and then another Sanskrit came in – Takruta

219
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,230
Sanskrit, then these five languages – Magadi,
Paishachi, Marathi, all these languages came

220
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,980
in. So it is derivation [of Sanskrit]. Other
languages in other countries that came up

221
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:09,290
was also of course the expression of the Kundalini,
but they learnt it more from say, the words

222
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:16,400
came from the outside; the sound of the air
flowing they call it ‘ssss’, so they call

223
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,610
it ’s’ like that. And from the nature
what ever they learnt from outside, because

224
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:27,780
the approach has been more objective; so objective
approach is always little less than the subjective

225
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,500
because subjective is from inside and objective
is from outside. So when you go from the objective,

226
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:39,490
the deviation into the main sound that are
coming from the inside, the purity is little

227
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,930
bit deviated. And you know what is objective
and subjectivity approach.

228
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,810
So this has happened with some languages.
Some languages are very, very close to Sanskrit

229
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:55,960
but they too took a turn according to their
gunas.

230
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:04,370
Now, the Satvaguni (सत्त्वगुणि),
the central path or the Satvaguni as they

231
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:13,730
call it, they are also the people who have
Satvaguna more in them; they see chakras in

232
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:20,810
the right form. But Satvagunis should not
be confused with the people who believe that

233
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,190
if you eat this then this is satvik (centred),
if you eat that that is tamasik (left-sided)

234
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:31,760
or if you say this, this is satvik or if you
do not kill anybody then it is satvik. In

235
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:39,830
this the right perception comes in. For example,
you have to explain why Krishna killed so

236
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:47,760
many rakshasas. It was absolutely satva; is
dharmic, absolutely dharmic. Why Durga killed

237
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,920
so many rakshasas? She had to eat the blood
of so many rakshasas.

238
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:05,700
So whatever is dharmic, the wisdom, the right
path comes through such people who are neither

239
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:17,170
too much this side, neither that side and
they know exactly what is the right way of

240
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:22,280
looking at life.
Such born realised people: this is a very,

241
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:28,880
very far-fetched stuff they are very few.
I would say perhaps you can say Buddha and

242
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:41,150
Mahavira are the only two human beings who
have gone through many lives, from one extreme

243
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:48,910
to another they went and ultimately they found
out that going to the extremes is not proper.

244
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:54,940
Still they have not reached the complete height
of an incarnation.

245
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:03,380
So a model was to be created who would all
the time be giving a fixed point for a person

246
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:10,240
to rise to that. And these are the different
models which are placed within us on our chakras.

247
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:23,100
And these models are perfect points belonging
to those chakras. So according to the nature

248
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:31,540
of the person who is watching these chakras,
one sees them and gives them importance also.

249
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:39,440
Now for a person like say, [Adi] Shankacharya:
Shankacharya is a born realised soul many

250
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,940
a times. He’s not born realised once, but
many a times he’s born realised, and he’s

251
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:52,740
sort of, he’s in the centre of it you can
say, one of them, you can call him. So when

252
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,810
he talks of his Mooladhara chakra he is sort
of, he has already done the path many a times

253
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,570
and now he’s going to the subtler and subtler
and subtler form. So when he says that the

254
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:08,119
Mooladhara chakra is opened out then you can
walk on the water it’s correct, because

255
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:14,779
he is at that subtle stage of ascendence.
One has to ascend once, second time, third

256
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:19,779
time, forth time, and then you see, you reach
a stage where you start ascending. But even

257
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:24,980
then it is not so important to walk on the
water what is so important to walk on the

258
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,619
water? It’s nothing so important because
you see it’s easy, you can take a boat and

259
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:35,919
walk! It’s nothing so important! So walking
on the [water], means also on the right hand

260
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,679
side; it’s a right-hand side [power] to
walk on the water or to fly in the air, all

261
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:49,839
this is the right-hand side things which also
can be done with the help of a boat, or what

262
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,990
you call an aircraft or even you can use a
bhoot! For that you can use a dead entity

263
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:03,359
and we can make him take us to any place we
feel like. It can be done! This ESP business

264
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,119
is only that.
So it can be done by other methods also. So

265
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,000
it is nothing important. You see, it’s sometimes
very confusing when we see that some people

266
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,420
can fly in the air! They say [that] in the
subtle form they have gone. You don’t see

267
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,839
the body moving but you see that they they
can feel it. The difference being that the

268
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:27,130
people who are realised can guide themselves
and can see the body moving but those who

269
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,940
are not realised they find that their subtle-being
being taken out and their consciousness going

270
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,619
with them somewhere else and they’re sitting
on top of the house; from there watching themselves

271
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:40,150
and they’re sitting there and they see themselves
sitting down like that, you see. These phenomenon

272
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:50,339
take place. That is absolutely nothing but
a soul being ridden by a dead entity. So there’s

273
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,880
nothing great about it. That is also right-side
stuff.

274
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,910
The left hand side as I told you is the emotional
feeling about things. You feel tremendous

275
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:08,309
love for others and sometimes you know people…I
would say Sainath was one of them who had

276
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:14,000
this left hand side gift with him, and he
was love personified. And he was so much full

277
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,509
of love for people that once there was a woman
who was very poor and she couldn’t celebrate

278
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:28,630
her Diwali day and he couldn’t bear it so
he gave her some water and the water became

279
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,829
like oil and she burnt lights in that; and
it’s a fact, you can do that, it’s possible.

280
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:42,730
And with this power you can increase food,
you increase the food stuff, like Christ did

281
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,009
it. That’s also [using] one side (left side).
So all these things come in a personality;

282
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:53,589
some people have one more another has some
more and some people have all these qualities.

283
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:57,980
Some, those who are incarnations have everything.
They can do everything that they want to.

284
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,220
And they will use whatever they want to do
and if they don’t want use any powers they

285
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:07,400
will not use. So it depends on…so it’s
nothing important, supposing you see something

286
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,119
alright, there you can see it is a good thing.
But that doesn’t mean that you should stick

287
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,890
on to those things but you must try to do
what you don’t see. For example, now you

288
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:23,380
see the light coming out of somebody’s head,
now that’s one side of looking at things.

289
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:31,759
Another is that you can feel the another person.
Don’t you feel the another person? How he

290
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:40,690
is, how he meets you, how you are coming closer
to that person. Can you feel that compassion

291
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:46,450
for him that he’s not where you are? That
also is another balancing stuff.

292
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,329
But this should done [only when you are solid].
This is very dangerous for some people who

293
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:53,690
try to be helpful to others when they are
not themselves solidified properly.

294
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,339
So I would again warn you that when you start
seeing lights and all that try to remember

295
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:02,470
that you are going on one side, you are seeing
more. Then be more compassionate in you tongues,

296
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,910
in your talking in your behaviour. Try to
have more love. Means right hand side is more

297
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:12,279
developing, the left is less; is the heart.
So you have to raise your Kundalini from right

298
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:16,019
and left, but this is all mechanical and it
works out. It’s only thinking about it,

299
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:20,579
“Oh, I have to develop my heart more,”
the balance has to be there. This also should

300
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,450
develop feeling for others. Now the feeling
for others cannot be explained as I feel for

301
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:30,440
others. I just, if somebody is crying anywhere
I get tears into my eyes automatically. Even

302
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,089
if you are not crying and if you are feeling
hurt about things I get this hurt feeling

303
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:41,160
within Myself. Like that, you see, you should
really feel that hurt feeling and that desperate

304
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,190
feeling and that cry. Of course I mean, it
comes to some people too much but they do

305
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,589
not have the other side.
So you should have both the sides and both

306
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:55,190
the balancing directors within you.
So those who are seeing things more should

307
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,150
not go on bothering about what they are seeing.
“It’s coming that way, alright” because

308
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,950
they have done that kind of tapasya so they
see things. And it helps Sahaja Yoga very

309
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,049
much because you can see for yourself who
is realised who’s not realised, this thing,

310
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:12,609
that thing.
But still the dryness is in you. So if it

311
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:19,210
is in you, you should try to develop it. So
whatever you don’t have you try to develop

312
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:24,940
that. Whatever you have don’t be satisfied
with that. That’s the best way you can rise.

313
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:30,069
Those people who can see things should try
to feel others. Those who can feel others

314
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:36,950
should see things and it will work out that
way. So this is what it is.

315
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:48,450
And in the mahakarana state where the mahakarana
is, that is a very, very subtlest form of

316
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:57,519
state, where the chakras which have got the
Deities are connected with, are sort of a

317
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:06,509
reflection of the Deities of the Viraata.
Now these Deities in the Viraata are reflected

318
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:14,920
in you, are awakened in you and they start
moving and making the whole thing work out

319
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,980
as it should be. Up to the karana state it
is very good. But the mahakarana state is

320
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:27,109
the stage where it is the real – what you
call the object – object and reflection.

321
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:33,759
When you can come up to the object which is
a really deep state of mind where you are

322
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:42,480
with the object and when you are at the object
you are very close to an incarnation state.

323
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,089
So we can say that as far as you people are
concerned you should try to understand up

324
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:54,660
to karana state, because beyond that how to
jump and how to go is not the question just

325
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,720
now. What’s the use of telling you about
something which is a far fetched stuff? So

326
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,299
we’ll talk about it later. But this is how
it is the fourth stage of chakras.

327
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:08,279
Now, tentza prashna? Ah, te chakra. Ha. (marathi:
His question? Ah, about chakras. ok.) He says

328
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:11,509
you see it [moving] anti-clockwise. You do
see [that]. Because most of the people who

329
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:15,130
have seen it have seen it on other people
and when you see on other people from the

330
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,680
backside, you see it on the anti-clockwise
side. But, if you see it from the front, it

331
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,420
is clockwise, that’s why.
Yogi: No, what I am saying is – you feel

332
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:30,880
the chakras moving, you are outside your own
body, still the chakras are moving in an anti-clockwise

333
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,039
manner.
Shri Mataji: Yes it depends on, you know,

334
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,529
what I’ve just now told you: that the chakras,
say for example, for an ordinary human being

335
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:40,960
the chakras are nothing but ordinary plexuses;
for a realised soul it is more than that.

336
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,749
So the more you move into a greater view of
your own awareness that’s how the chakras

337
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:54,289
start manifesting. Now for example my chakras
are working all over. All over. Do you see

338
00:41:54,289 --> 00:42:01,730
the difference? So it depends on the awareness
of the person. As much as the light now say;

339
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:11,869
that much it shows the light, you see as much
as the power. So that is what it is.

340
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:22,710
Now is there are any questions left on chakras?
Yogi: About the number of petals.

341
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:34,539
Shri Mataji: Yes. Number of petals are also
gross stuff you see. Till you go to a certain

342
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:41,749
stage where your petals are being created,
because of a, there’s a little mathematics

343
00:42:41,749 --> 00:42:46,499
about it, little mathematics. And all this
mathematics has been worked out in a human

344
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:59,450
being – how it is. But these are the…we
can say that now for example, in a person

345
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:13,529
now, a light is there: say 25 watts. Now 25
watts are to be converted to 60 watts or something

346
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:18,960
like that. So we have to see the dimension
into which the person, means that portion,

347
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,490
is going to grow, you see. It’s a big mathematics
about you. The dimension to which that can

348
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:33,809
grow and into what sphere it is going to penetrate.
For example, the Mooladhara chakra you can

349
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:42,220
take for an example now. Mooladhara chakra
is actually fourth that way, because it covers

350
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:50,609
the four sides of the human personality. It’s
in the abstract calculation, it is the fourth

351
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:54,220
side of the personality. And the fifth side,
the movement in the fifth dimension, doesn’t

352
00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:02,579
take in the Mooladhara chakra. It takes above
the Mooladhara chakra.

353
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,809
So the fourth dimensions as shown by that.
These are the different dimensions of a man.

354
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:12,960
At those levels how many dimensions you touch
by these tattoos – it is calculated like

355
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:21,299
that. In My book I have given notes of these
in very great details as to what are the dimensions

356
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:25,549
one touches in this state and how far you
go.

357
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:32,819
But the same Mooladhara becomes only two later
on. But it is such a subtle and sharp two

358
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:41,619
which penetrates just like this, all over.
So it depends on…you can say in a machine

359
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:45,759
you have different types of bones and different
types of screws and with different dates.

360
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:54,460
Now what is the calculation? Is there any
reason you can say why it is so?

361
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:59,539
So it is a very detailed work and it’s all
worked out because the dimensions into which

362
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:04,859
a human being will be going, all that is worked
out, and on that chakra only these is dimensions

363
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:09,999
you achieve. So it has a meaning. But it’s
not only four chakras. It’s not only four.

364
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:14,220
It has got many petals inside and it’s a
very interesting one. Actually on Mooladhara

365
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:20,369
I have written a big chapter, complete. How
many folds are inside and how these things

366
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:25,789
work out and how many folds, what do they
suggest and how far they open out, because

367
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:30,769
it’s all a dimension which is worked out.
For example, if you take a banyan tree, the

368
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:37,269
seed is so small. A banyan tree has the smallest
seed. Now why is it so? And why is it so microscopic?

369
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:43,109
Because it is so dynamic. For you this is
all worked out like a capsule. And it’s

370
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:48,559
a capsule which is to work this dimension
[and] it has to work that dimension. So it

371
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,039
is rather a calculated stuff – which I have
described. I have only described Mooladhara

372
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:58,910
really in the full [way] because it makes
such a big volume of one Mooladhara chakra,

373
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,490
that I gave up about others. I have just mentioned
[briefly] about them.

374
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:06,240
But only Mooladhara itself, when I started
describing, it became such a big, huge thing.

375
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,089
So I gave in I said, “Now better not do
other ones (chakras).” But it’s quite

376
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:18,630
a complicated stuff and, God has his own stage
or style of planning and we can’t question

377
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:28,099
Him. He does it according to His own whim.
He has his own style. But [even] His whim

378
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:33,559
has understanding – everything has.
You will find that sometimes if you try to

379
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:40,059
study that way. If you ask Me certain things
I try to answer it in a different way. Because

380
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:44,990
there are His ways of doing things and He
understands and that’s how He does it. But

381
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:50,430
still I have tried to bring out at least Mooladhara
chakra, so that human beings must understand

382
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:55,299
that how complicated they are made, how God
has been so careful to place their Mooladhara

383
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:59,920
so well and how He has put the force there,
how it’s a living machinery, how it’s

384
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,609
working out so that people should understand
the importance of their chakras and importance

385
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:07,829
of their being, how important you are. You
are not ordinary people.

386
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:14,069
Even if there’s a say an ordinary tape recorder,
we are so careful about it. How much we should

387
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:18,640
be careful about our own machinery, which
is being created in ages with such great understanding,

388
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,289
such mechanism! Every chakra if you take up,
even if you take up three yugas, you won’t

389
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:29,519
understand one chakra. It is such a tremendous
working inside. I have of course given only

390
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:39,999
the description of it and the reason why is
a stage which will make you really mad! But

391
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:50,940
I’ve tried to explain in that. You have
read my [description of] Mooladhara did you?

392
00:47:50,940 --> 00:48:03,499
It’s quite an elaborate stuff.
Question: In Delhi, the question was “what

393
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:26,089
is the purpose of life?”
But that stage I never cancelled it, that

394
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:36,950
stage is not today. You see when I said it
that just now you have to incarnate again

395
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:43,900
and again. You are not at that stage. But
when the whole thing…you see, nothing is

396
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,349
wrong in any one of these. When they say,
“There is a day of judgement.” But before

397
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:55,069
that God is going to give you a chance. He
is going to give you a full chance to improve

398
00:48:55,069 --> 00:49:00,619
yourself [and] go to that position. You see,
like that, we can say that, first the trees

399
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:04,470
are brought into the by sowing the seeds then
the trees grow up, then there are flowers,

400
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,589
then the flowers are again, they become seeds.
Then again the trees and again this thing,

401
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:13,269
until again they reach a certain stage, till
they have completely ripened then they remove

402
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:18,759
the whole thing and the whole thing becomes
the Brahma itself. And whatever is a waste

403
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:23,819
matter is thrown out.
So ultimately it’s the union. But the “union

404
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:30,789
of your being” means with God. It’s a
much greater state. First of all it’s the

405
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:34,650
purification point. You see for your purification
you are to be born again. You have not reached

406
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:38,980
that stage where you should become mahanirvana,
have you? If you become, might be [that] you

407
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,980
might land up in hell so better not try that!
See, you must understand that just now, at

408
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,960
this stage you have to go further, purifying
yourself till you reach a certain stage where,

409
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,849
when you reach a certain stage, at that time,
God has given you enough chance, enough chance

410
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:59,799
to improve yourself. [But if] still you are
rakshasas then you are not going to be tried

411
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:06,640
any more. But it’s quite clear, I must say.
You cannot now allow it to take to chance.

412
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:17,749
One of the butchery is going to be very close,
is very close; I mean I would say can be anytime.

413
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:23,809
So you be careful I mean, it’s just there.
So many have to be neutralised because they

414
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:32,640
are just very troublesome. So it can be quite
close so just be careful about it.

415
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,339
So, you see, if everything fits into everything
else but what happens is every religion, part

416
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:42,079
of it is said so this cuts out the other.
Supposing I say, “You have to go to this

417
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,410
room,” now if I say that, “You have to
come two steps that side,” and then I say,

418
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:50,369
“You have to come three steps this side,”
these are all connected stuff but because

419
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:54,670
it is said only three steps here so you said,
“Then in that religion it is said three

420
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,089
steps inside you and what about those two
steps?” I have to tell about them also.

421
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:02,339
Because I have to tell about all those two
steps [that] you have to take first, I better

422
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:06,380
not tell about these three steps because you’ll
put your eyes, oh, very nice. It’s not going

423
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,499
to come in a plate (easily). You have to work
it out consciously. Understand now.

424
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:24,380
Yogi: Where do the chakras go after death?
Shri Mataji: Chakra is within you, chakras

425
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:36,319
is a place. They just only exist within you.
Yogi: Within the Earth element?

426
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,450
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. They are in the body
only, they are in the body. The body is itself

427
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:47,579
like a seed, you see, you become like a seed.
But they are potent. You can’t see them.

428
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:52,630
Chakra is a state.
Yogi: I think chakra and kundalini must be

429
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,059
together?
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is something like

430
00:51:56,059 --> 00:52:01,549
a light going out and the tube is still there.
It is like that the Kundalini. But it stays

431
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:05,569
on top of the head of the person. The only
difference is, supposing, the light goes out

432
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:13,119
and stays near by. You see the potential is
there in the light. It is like that. The place

433
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:25,859
for the light to pass is there.
Question: (inaudible)

434
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:48,650
Shri Mataji: No, no. They’re already separated
in the gross they are separated; inside also

435
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:55,579
they’re separated but there’s a void because
yes, that is the only point. You see, the

436
00:52:55,579 --> 00:53:02,089
Kundalini gets enlightened or sort of she
gets a little enlightened you can say when

437
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:05,599
it faces me and it immediately starts rising.
Or when you people [also], because you are

438
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,099
also Sahaja Yogis. It doesn’t happen with
anybody else you will be amazed you know.

439
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:32,980
So now what is the other question?
Question: How do the chakras move in the body;

440
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,499
is it horizontally?
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. That is true, they

441
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:40,259
are moving horizontally. They are moving horizontal
but when you move them like this, you see;

442
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:46,109
like you have seen the wheel…
Question: Why not you go this way?

443
00:53:46,109 --> 00:53:50,150
Shri Mataji: No it doesn’t work out. It
works out better this way. Because these are

444
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,380
the things that are emitting, you see. If
you do it like this it goes down. This way

445
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,819
these are moving you can move this. You have
seen that in a watch there are some like this

446
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,239
parallel and some are like this.
Ata dusra kai prashna ahe? (marathi: now what

447
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:10,230
other question is there?)
Yogini: Mataji, the fake gurus have damaged

448
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:30,029
the chakras. How do they do it? And what’s
to be done about it?

449
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:39,329
Shri Mataji: You see, what gurus do is they
use different chakras for introducing into

450
00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:46,029
the sympathetic nervous system some entities
which they have controlled. They do not control

451
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:52,599
many entities as such, but what happens, for
example now I would say, during war many people

452
00:54:52,599 --> 00:55:02,259
died just like that; killed and this and that.
In those countries, those souls, they never

453
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:09,400
had a [normal] human life and they were treated
just like animals and they were very much

454
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,400
tortured. So they had that feeling in their
minds that, “We should also torture these

455
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,670
people.” So when they die they do not die
really and they do not get into the pretloka

456
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,249
(प्रेत लोक Spirit world).
They stay in the atmosphere and that’s why

457
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:28,269
wars are very bad things, because wars create
such human beings much more, with accidents

458
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:33,319
and people who are very depraved in life,
very dissatisfied who are doing all kinds

459
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:38,940
of depraved actions and secretive things and
all kinds of horrid things. All such people,

460
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,819
all of them, when they die they do not really
go to pretaloka because they don’t think

461
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:54,970
of their salvation but they are just thinking
of their lust, greed or we can say possessions,

462
00:55:54,970 --> 00:56:01,239
those who are grabbing things, thieves and
all sorts of people. We can call ‘evil’

463
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:05,710
people and satanic people, when they die they
find they become much more subtler and they

464
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:11,109
can be better off if they act in a subtle
body. So they use the subtle body for acting

465
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:15,729
into people and such people are easily available.
So these gurus, what they do, that they themselves

466
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:21,239
are evil geniuses, and they have a way of
capturing those people and they use them.

467
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:25,059
And they introduce to you through your different
chakras. For example, Ravana had a capacity

468
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:30,829
to speak and in his speech he used to introduce
rakshasas into the human beings in Ceylon.

469
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:35,849
Otherwise imagine in Lanka, people should
never fight Rama, because at that time the

470
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:40,210
sensitivity of people was so great that they
knew that Rama was an incarnation. They were

471
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:44,729
not gross as today they are, that one has
to tell that, “Oh, here I am the incarnation.”

472
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:50,229
That time it was not Kali Yuga so they knew
he was an incarnation. And so many of them,

473
00:56:50,229 --> 00:56:54,519
I mean some of them did not, but quite a lot
of them knew and despite that nobody could

474
00:56:54,519 --> 00:57:01,680
oppose it because their mind was captured
by these entities put [into them] by Ravana

475
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,569
and they fought Him.
So, it was so, even at the time of Krishna:

476
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:08,710
people knew who He was at least they had quite
an idea, even Kauravas new about it.

477
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:15,279
But this Kali Yuga is a wretched thing – nobody
see anything clearly. But those times were

478
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:19,539
not like that. People knew who was an incarnation
and they understood it.

479
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:24,799
At that time also, these people had to use
some sort of a way of putting them off and

480
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:29,569
they used this method of enticement.
And when they used this method of enticement,

481
00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:34,170
in that use, they learned also subtler ways
and subtler ways which they are using in Kali

482
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:39,479
Yuga very well. They are actually rakshasas
and they know these methods – how to entice

483
00:57:39,479 --> 00:57:45,799
people. There are so many ways of doing it.
And when you bend your head before them that

484
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:50,349
is the best time when they can put it into
your ego and they can finish you off for once

485
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:53,259
for all. So that’s how they do it. And you
are no more yourself!

486
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:58,940
First of all they act on your heart: you become
a nervous person your hands start shaking

487
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:03,759
your feet start shaking; they act on your
heart chakra. You use the power of raksha

488
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:10,799
(रक्षा – protection) which is
the basic point of the heart chakra. And then,

489
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:16,970
once you start losing the grip over your nerves
you find that [it’s] as if somebody is doing

490
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:20,839
for you. And if you take somebody’s name
you start jumping and you don’t know anything

491
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,269
– it’s an experience, you see. There are
so many things they do like that: thousand

492
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:29,880
and one [things].
But human beings, as a whole in the Kali Yuga,

493
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:38,930
instead of improving has gone down absolutely
in his conception of Divinity and in everything.

494
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:47,900
I mean he’s a hopeless case otherwise! But
by God’s grace Sahaja Yoga may save him.

495
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,200
They way it is I mean he’s very, very blunt.
He cannot seek, he’s very insensitive. And

496
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:58,319
he carries on all kinds of his malpractices
thinking that he’s a rare saint ever born.

497
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:04,440
You see that’s another great quality of
Kali Yuga! This is the problem. They have

498
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:11,729
no conscience left now to tell them that this
is wrong or that is wrong they’ve killed

499
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:23,999
it. Everywhere it is so.
Tumhi shalid shi mulad ka? (marathi: your

500
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:29,599
kids are in school?)
Yogi: Ho. (yes)

501
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:39,650
Shri Mataji: Achcha (ok). Ata dusra prashna
(marathi: now another question)

502
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:50,700
Yogi: How music works on the five chakras?
Shri Mataji: You see all these five elements

503
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:58,970
are very important in our body and they are
the body of the chakras also as I have told

504
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:06,239
you. So what happens that, when you sing the
music, the vibrations can go through the musical

505
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:12,569
sound and can excite certain chakras. You
see for example for the hriday (heart) chakra

506
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:18,960
is very good or also for the Vishuddhi chakra
it is very good. Not for all the chakras.

507
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,839
But certain chakras it does. But supposing
you say a mantra that’s the sound, with

508
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:31,069
beautiful music and a realised soul then it
is very effective. For example, Ganesha you

509
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:38,229
can excite him with a beautiful sloka if you
are a realised soul and if your Ganesha is

510
01:00:38,229 --> 01:00:43,759
correct, you can excite the Ganesha of another
person very easily, I mean such a person do

511
01:00:43,759 --> 01:00:47,109
it.
So music, sound, all these things have an

512
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:52,989
effect and we are now using that method very
extensively. But supposing now, we go in a

513
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:57,369
mass meditation and many people are there
and some chakra is caught, say Vishuddhi is

514
01:00:57,369 --> 01:01:01,529
caught, I can correct their Vishuddhi by just
putting My finger on this, like this, because

515
01:01:01,529 --> 01:01:09,700
this has the sound, this is in the chakras,
there is a micro-sound which is carrying the

516
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,289
vibrations. Actually the part of the vibrations
is the micro-sound also, micro-light, micro-sound

517
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:18,279
and you can say all the five elements are
micro there. So when I put my finger the micro

518
01:01:18,279 --> 01:01:25,239
sound can carry the rest of them and the person
can be corrected. We can do it. Specially

519
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:29,099
Vishuddhi. Very easy to correct Vishuddhi
on that. You can correct most of the things

520
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:33,079
but certain things are very easily corrected.
Vishuddhi, which is responsible for the sound,

521
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:41,380
made from the sound element.
As we have seen that water element is very

522
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:50,410
good for treating people for the lower chakras,
up to the heart chakra, because the water

523
01:01:50,410 --> 01:02:01,269
and salt can help you for the Nabhi chakra
because salt is the earth element and it is

524
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:07,910
essence of the ocean and the essence of the
ocean is in the bhavasagara. So we can use

525
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:12,799
salt water for clearing the lower chakras.
We can use light for the eyes because, this

526
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:21,519
is made out of the prakash – light element.
Like that different things can be done. And

527
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:28,349
with these different elements if you use them,
you can make all the dirt or all the obstructions,

528
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:36,940
which are collected, in your particular chakra
by putting them back into the same element

529
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,390
and cleansing them out so the element takes
it away.

530
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:45,079
For Mother Earth also, She has so many elements
in Her that She can take away so many of your

531
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:53,819
problems which are troubling you, in your
being, because of some imbalance of the Mother

532
01:02:53,819 --> 01:03:01,519
Earth element. You see, this is all due to
the imbalance of these elements in you, accumulated

533
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:10,329
more beyond than what you want it. That’s
why I said, “the extreme of it.”

534
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:19,019
Prithvi tattwa (earth element) is expressed
through Shri Ganesh and Shri Ganesh is the

535
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:31,819
form of the purified principle of the Earth
element and is the same. I mean, in a flute

536
01:03:31,819 --> 01:03:40,559
you have two notes, the first and the last
are the same. In the same way in a human being

537
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:47,349
the seven notes, the first one is a Ganesha
and the last one is also a Ganesha. So these

538
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:59,039
seven notes are the same. And these seven
notes make the Earth element and not completely

539
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,519
Earth element but started with earth element
purified. When it loses its Earth element

540
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:10,670
problems completely it is Parabrahma, I mean
it becomes all Brahma. Because Earth element

541
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:19,660
is, outside is the Earth element but inside
is dhara, is dhara, is dharana – is the

542
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:28,759
power to sustain, is the power to sustain.
And that power is the purest form of Earth

543
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:34,460
principle (tattwa). So, that you become later
on; gradually the whole Earth element drops

544
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:45,569
down and you become that.
So it is the dharana shakti as they call it:

545
01:04:45,569 --> 01:04:47,660
the power of sustenance. Is the Ganesha. So,
like that, in every chakra you have a very

546
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:56,369
subtle and subtle-most point. And that subtle-most
point is the note that the Divine is playing

547
01:04:56,369 --> 01:05:02,579
at that point, because every note has a different
frequency, a different intonation, a different

548
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:13,079
sound, which helps in the melody of this Universe.
So, like that, we have seven chakras and the

549
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:18,859
seven notes. And they are different notes
but these notes then create permutations and

550
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:26,150
combinations and that is how a chakra gets
into a swara (musical note) and then it becomes

551
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:32,039
a sound, and from a sound it becomes a word,
and from word it becomes a language and like

552
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:39,529
that it goes on and the same subtle form starts
becoming something else. For example if I

553
01:05:39,529 --> 01:05:45,589
have love for my children: how [do] I express
it? I make a house for them, I make a place

554
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:51,839
to live for them, I cook food for them, I
make a bed for them. It’s a gross expression

555
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:57,859
of that subtle love I have. In the same way
whatever is subtle within us is expressed

556
01:05:57,859 --> 01:06:04,239
outside with the help of the elements that
are outside, to express the subtle through

557
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:10,089
our gross behaviour or gross material things
also we do.

558
01:06:10,089 --> 01:06:17,569
So, it’s the same subtle, which is expressing
outside. But then we become so gross later

559
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:22,660
on that we forget the inner part of it. A
Mother may create something, all these things

560
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:26,119
and then she becomes so possessive of her
children, she’ll think, “I’ve done so

561
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:30,589
much for my children,” that she wouldn’t
even think why she has made it! She forgets

562
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:35,180
the love part of it and she becomes nothing
but the gross thing. She just starts scolding

563
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:40,200
the children, even for a small thing here
and there. You see she does this for love,

564
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,900
and then she forgets it. That’s what is
an extreme behaviour. Extreme behaviour means,

565
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:46,950
from the subtle, you get to the gross and
the gross, and the grosser. Once you become

566
01:06:46,950 --> 01:07:00,160
grosser you are dead.
Ata kai prashna? (Marathi: Now what question?)

567
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:08,279
Yogi: (asks question about badhas)
Shri Mataji: Those who can see badhas are

568
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:14,869
on the emotional side. They can see the badhas.
There also you can see two types of people.

569
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:20,269
Those who already themselves in badha, they
can see badhas, very clearly; they can see

570
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:24,369
the dead persons. Those who are already badha
can see that another person who has got a

571
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:29,170
badha because they are in the collective subconscious
themselves, so they can see. And a person

572
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:37,819
the one who, supposing, who is a drunkard
– he can see. A person who is drunk can

573
01:07:37,819 --> 01:07:43,999
see a badha in another person because he is
a subconscious type, he likes it.

574
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:50,039
But some people can achieve a state in an
emotional way that they can see badha clearly.

575
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:55,479
If they are realised souls, the emotional
state, people say, the bhakti people can see

576
01:07:55,479 --> 01:08:03,219
badha there. But even the supra-conscious
people can see a light coming before them,

577
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:06,829
they can see somebody standing before them
like a light and then say that, “There’s

578
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:16,359
a light coming.” They might get fragrance
or things like that can happen. They are called

579
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:25,270
as tanmatras is the causal principle of all
the Universe, causal – tanmatras. Means

580
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:38,250
for Earth the causal principle is fragrance.
So, supposing somebody has done a lot of search

581
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:51,600
in the field of say, earth element, so such
a person can get a lot of fragrance; they

582
01:08:51,600 --> 01:09:05,550
can. It is a variety everywhere created because
of their different searches and because of

583
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:11,380
their different seeking.
You see badha, just say somebody has a badha

584
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:18,040
or not. If he has Agya and a heart it’s
definitely a badha. And you just ask the person

585
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:28,350
to put their hands before the photograph and
he starts shaking. Normally he shakes.

586
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:40,980
You see I don’t know how you should make
it out but it’s really easy you can make

587
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:45,330
out the, cannot put their eyes towards my
photograph. If you ask them to close their

588
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:52,480
eyes their eyes will start flickering, hands
will start shaking, eyes will always flicker.

589
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:58,590
slightest ?? will show on the eyelids like
this. You see badha, can be of many types.

590
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:02,750
Some people just have for the time being,
some people have permanent residence. Some

591
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:24,070
have bags full! So you just can’t say what
it will be.

592
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:36,510
You just don’t worry about these things.
You see the thing is people think that there’s

593
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:42,310
only one type of badha, emotional badha. There
can be both types, a person who is very egotistical

594
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:46,960
also is dominated by somebody else. Abnormal
area, abnormal behaviour, who is not a normal

595
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:56,890
person, can come from anywhere.
There is no difference between sunlight and

596
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:11,430
sun, moonlight and moon. So there is no difference
at all. It is only the human beings who think

597
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:30,230
there are two stuffs. Which is an advaita
(non-duality), which one and the same thing.

598
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:45,470
For example, now this bangle is beautifying
my hand, so what is the difference between

599
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:58,350
this bangle and the beautification? Is the
quality of a person. Is the quality. It’s

600
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:20,370
like the ?? and ??. You will take out the
rest of it and you will say that this is all

601
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:25,560
useless. It’s not that. You see, in every
thing this is all there, it’s one. What

602
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:36,400
is the essence of sunlight and sun? Sun has
no meaning without sunlight. Sunlight has

603
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:57,960
no meaning without sun. It is not essence,
it is everything but. We can say water and

604
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:04,040
a ice. There is no difference at all. Human
beings cannot conceive it, that’s the trouble

605
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:10,230
with the human mind, because it is an advaita,
so human beings cannot see it. They think

606
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:20,550
of two (manifold) things always. You see through
perception it is not possible for you to perceive

607
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:24,810
it, but you can understand by analysing. Many
things human beings can’t understand. You

608
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:31,890
just cannot, because you have a limited brain,
you have a limited awareness, you have limited

609
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:32,380
love.
