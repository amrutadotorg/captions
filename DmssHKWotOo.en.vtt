03:42.320 --> 03:49.240
Sahasrara Puja Evening Talk. Thredbo (Australia) 3 May 1987.

04:45.959 --> 04:51.849
I hope today’s lecture did not shock you very much.

04:54.068 --> 04:57.129
I had to tell you about it,

04:57.329 --> 05:00.301
otherwise you would not know your importance,

05:00.501 --> 05:06.166
your greatness, your responsibilities.

05:13.534 --> 05:16.874
But I must warn you about the ghost as I told you,

05:17.074 --> 05:19.405
because a mother has to warn about the ghost

05:19.605 --> 05:24.980
to frighten the children, that’s important;

05:25.729 --> 05:32.202
and the ghost is materialism, as I
said, which has become so important.

05:32.402 --> 05:41.261
Matter always tries to overpower the spirit, all the time.

05:42.683 --> 05:47.175
All the habits are formed because of the matter.

05:47.375 --> 05:50.800
Even the habits of drinking, say, habits of taking drugs

05:51.000 --> 06:00.011
is nothing but these horrible, powerful material things

06:00.211 --> 06:05.916
which are dead are trying to overpower us.

06:08.422 --> 06:17.934
The spirit is paramount, it is the highest thing.

06:18.134 --> 06:21.819
Nothing can reach it.

06:22.019 --> 06:32.873
It keeps you away from all the skirmishes,

06:33.073 --> 06:44.782
all the cheap and superficial problems of the world.

06:46.649 --> 06:52.384
Materialism has grown much more today than ever before.

06:52.584 --> 06:55.352
It has become very important for people

06:55.552 --> 07:00.657
to worry about things that they possess.

07:00.857 --> 07:08.001
I find in the West it has grown so subtly and so sophisticatedly

07:08.201 --> 07:15.947
that it is difficult even to find out
how far we have gone with it.

07:16.502 --> 07:25.518
It’s like plastic, which can penetrate
into everything and can hold it.

07:28.800 --> 07:34.798
This materialism has brought us to the cracking point now,

07:34.998 --> 07:39.383
the whole world is bothered about it.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.327
First of all there are ecological imbalances.

07:43.527 --> 07:48.358
People are watching the trees are dying out,

07:48.558 --> 07:53.051
because factories are being created out of proportion,

07:53.251 --> 07:56.254
and the factories need all the time something to be fed into them;

08:02.217 --> 08:11.941
and they go on and on and on, creating
things which are not so much necessary.

08:12.141 --> 08:23.080
As I told you, it’s a play of the evil
forces which is very much collective.

08:23.650 --> 08:28.794
Say for a factory starts,

08:28.994 --> 08:33.611
then clothes are made, for example,

08:33.812 --> 08:44.849
then there’s an entrepreneur who comes
forward to make the clothes to be sold out.

08:45.049 --> 08:53.016
Now he is the one who changes, he
starts changing the forms of the clothes

08:53.216 --> 08:58.375
in such a way that every year, new lot comes out of that machine,

08:58.575 --> 09:01.527
and everybody has pile of clothes in the house,

09:01.727 --> 09:04.418
they don’t know what to do with it. These are last year’s,

09:04.618 --> 09:09.582
that’s before last year’s, that’s that last year’s,

09:09.782 --> 09:18.980
of no use, absolutely useless, all made of artificial fiber.

09:20.183 --> 09:24.124
It is hard to find anything natural in all the Western countries

09:24.324 --> 09:28.132
wherever I have been, anything that is cotton,

09:28.332 --> 09:32.757
anything that is pure silk.

09:34.547 --> 09:38.136
There should be some balance that machines are for us,

09:38.336 --> 09:42.025
we are not for the machines.

09:42.225 --> 09:47.119
Then new types of machines are coming out now

09:47.319 --> 09:53.422
to befool the people,

09:53.622 --> 09:59.430
to take advantage of their stupidity I should say,

09:59.630 --> 10:04.074
and change one after another things,

10:04.274 --> 10:07.035
as creating fashions.

10:07.235 --> 10:09.926
As I’m told in America,

10:10.126 --> 10:15.229
every bathroom has a different type of a switch or a handle,

10:15.429 --> 10:17.783
you don’t know which one to push.

10:17.983 --> 10:21.894
You push one handle and you might feel you might get

10:22.095 --> 10:27.722
all the water on top of your head, is a new style.

10:30.183 --> 10:35.498
Now I’ve seen the bathroom that I have, it’s very interesting.

10:38.246 --> 10:43.204
You must know horse-riding to get into it.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.300
And it’s all surrounded by glass,

10:49.500 --> 10:55.020
I mean anybody would be nervous taking bath in there;

10:56.317 --> 11:01.442
and there are big, big holes you see, just as handles.

11:01.933 --> 11:04.881
Of course these things will again go back,

11:05.081 --> 11:08.756
because normalcy works out. Like in our body also,

11:08.956 --> 11:15.166
if we do anything extreme we come back
to our parasympathetic which balances.

11:15.366 --> 11:20.190
So the nature brings you back again to the same thing.

11:20.390 --> 11:22.427
Like they said “have no marriages,”

11:22.628 --> 11:24.710
then “have marriages with men.”

11:24.910 --> 11:27.570
Men having marriages with men, women having marriages with women,

11:27.770 --> 11:31.027
all kinds of nonsensical marriage systems they developed.

11:31.228 --> 11:33.918
So they must have varieties, you see: “How can it be

11:34.118 --> 11:36.739
that a woman should marry a man?”

11:36.939 --> 11:39.879
Then an old woman marrying a very young boy,

11:40.079 --> 11:42.432
or an old man marrying a very little girl,

11:42.632 --> 11:45.581
all kinds of nonsensical things started.

11:45.781 --> 11:47.975
Now it’s coming back again.

11:48.176 --> 11:52.237
We can’t have many wives, we can’t be with many women,

11:52.437 --> 11:54.593
we have to be married to one woman,

11:54.794 --> 11:59.718
all those things are coming back, but at what cost?

12:00.898 --> 12:05.297
We have got already a disease which is called as killer’s disease;

12:05.497 --> 12:08.031
so many problems have been created by this kind

12:08.231 --> 12:14.063
of movement towards the left or towards the right.

12:15.633 --> 12:22.726
Before the war started it was more
the movement on the left-hand side.

12:22.926 --> 12:28.320
All the poets wrote about something imaginary tragic,

12:28.520 --> 12:34.961
like the Greek tragedy. I don’t know
why there should be a tragedy in Greece.

12:35.161 --> 12:39.984
Itself, Greece itself is a tragedy for every one of us.

12:40.184 --> 12:42.539
But they created a tragedy.

12:42.739 --> 12:49.157
I mean, it’s a horrid stuff that they
have created. So everybody is miserable,

12:49.357 --> 12:52.165
"Les Miserables all of them,

12:52.365 --> 12:56.985
and French people don’t like Me much because I’m not serious.

12:57.185 --> 12:59.925
I should not laugh, I should be very serious.

13:00.125 --> 13:05.714
When talking about God I should be even worse than a dead body,

13:05.914 --> 13:10.126
otherwise they don’t want to listen to you.

13:10.326 --> 13:14.439
All kinds of stupidity started that move to the left,

13:14.639 --> 13:17.712
doing all kinds of perverse things.

13:17.912 --> 13:20.709
When Mr. Freud came in they said, “That’s a good leader for us.

13:20.909 --> 13:24.372
Now he’ll give us some more varieties.”

13:24.573 --> 13:31.461
I was in a very big banquet, sitting
next to the ambassador of Mexico,

13:31.661 --> 13:34.961
and he told Me that “I’m told You are against Freud completely.”

13:35.161 --> 13:38.114
“Yes, I am,” I said, “Jung was a sensible man.”

13:38.315 --> 13:41.308
He said, “What is in Jung? He told us what all these

13:41.509 --> 13:43.898
our books have told, so what is so great about him

13:44.098 --> 13:46.343
that he’s told something the same thing?

13:46.543 --> 13:49.845
But Freud told us something new, so he’s great.”

13:50.045 --> 13:52.705
I said, “All right. We have never eaten this table,

13:52.905 --> 13:58.538
should we eat that because it’s a new thing to do?”

13:58.738 --> 14:04.605
Of course it was not very diplomatic.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.871
Mut I did say because I couldn’t help. This kind of a funny idea:

14:13.071 --> 14:15.519
“it’s a new idea, let’s have a new idea”,

14:15.719 --> 14:19.176
any new idea, you just do it.

14:19.376 --> 14:21.939
Now in, say, in Rome they have a new idea,

14:22.140 --> 14:26.051
that they should wear all the things with the sequins all over.

14:26.251 --> 14:29.033
Now the sequins thing you cannot wash much.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.896
So today they’ll waste all their money on the sequins,

14:32.096 --> 14:34.173
tomorrow they cannot wash it, they’ll get dirty,

14:34.374 --> 14:38.884
so they’ll start on something else.

14:40.548 --> 14:42.879
We have to be normal people as Sahaja yogis,

14:43.079 --> 14:49.587
to understand that we’ll not allow matter to supersede us.

14:51.718 --> 14:57.502
Now today just to celebrate the Sahasrara Day in full way,

14:57.702 --> 15:00.323
I thought of wearing a sari with many chakras.

15:00.523 --> 15:03.628
It has some symbol, it’s symbolic thing;

15:03.828 --> 15:07.042
and the starry sky that you see all over,

15:07.242 --> 15:11.800
to represent that, the blue color.

15:13.104 --> 15:17.318
Blue color is the sign of depth. It has some symbol.

15:17.518 --> 15:20.183
It’s not without any symbol, without any meaning,

15:20.383 --> 15:24.503
that you wear anything because some factory is producing

15:24.703 --> 15:29.042
these things in bulk and they must be sold.

15:29.242 --> 15:32.760
We should be out of all these things. These things should not touch us,

15:32.961 --> 15:35.830
these things should not impress us, but we should laugh at them.

15:36.031 --> 15:39.095
"Oh, there is now a new craze has started another one",

15:39.295 --> 15:42.750
and now they are looking like scarecrows everywhere, I find.

15:42.951 --> 15:46.595
I mean, they can be used for that purpose very easily.

15:46.795 --> 15:50.993
It’s terrible the way things are working out.

15:51.193 --> 15:54.556
But the worst thing that happens with materialism,

15:54.756 --> 16:01.249
that your attention becomes very superficial, very superficial.

16:01.449 --> 16:07.369
You go on watching everything, you read every sign board.

16:07.569 --> 16:10.030
If you have missed one you’ll turn around, “I’ve missed one,”

16:10.231 --> 16:15.332
so you must read that. The whole attention is so superficial.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.132
You are looking at women, women are looking at men,

16:18.332 --> 16:22.476
men are looking at – I don’t know what they are looking at.

16:22.676 --> 16:28.961
The attention is so stupid and so
foolish, and I have seen in their eyes

16:29.161 --> 16:32.851
the bhoots are passing from one to another.

16:33.051 --> 16:38.460
It’s absolutely evil to put your eyes to such a strain.

16:38.660 --> 16:44.460
Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes.” How many Christians there are who have,

16:44.660 --> 16:48.019
who haven’t got adulterous eyes?

16:48.219 --> 16:52.566
So what you find that the whole thing becomes extremely superficial,

16:52.766 --> 16:57.854
even the religion. All religions have become anti-God,

16:58.054 --> 17:00.550
these are all anti-God activities.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.862
They have nothing to do with God, they have nothing to do with religion,

17:04.062 --> 17:08.145
they have nothing to do with dharma as we call it.

17:08.346 --> 17:13.967
They are making all kinds of advertisements

17:14.167 --> 17:16.798
that they are very religious, that they believe in God,

17:16.998 --> 17:20.345
that they are doing all good things.

17:20.545 --> 17:30.869
Christ, who lived under very meager circumstances,

17:31.069 --> 17:34.385
was born in a manger.

17:34.585 --> 17:39.114
If you go and see the property of Pope you will be amazed and aghast.

17:39.315 --> 17:42.580
He has more property than even the tsars had,

17:42.780 --> 17:48.187
even the great kings of China had.

17:48.387 --> 17:53.062
And now they are hand-in-glove with mafia,

17:53.262 --> 17:57.529
still they are heads of the religion.

17:57.729 --> 18:00.584
Same in India, the way religion is preached

18:00.784 --> 18:03.607
with all nonsensical things going on.

18:03.807 --> 18:06.752
There’s no sense in what they are talking; the Hindu religion,

18:06.952 --> 18:10.939
the Sikh religion, and the Islamic religion is another nonsense.

18:11.139 --> 18:14.982
It has nothing to do with God, it’s all anti-God activity.

18:15.182 --> 18:17.388
It just forces people,

18:17.588 --> 18:23.302
it just frightens people and makes them suffer,

18:23.502 --> 18:30.850
and uses all the property, the wealth that they have.

18:31.050 --> 18:34.274
What is the interest of a person who is religious

18:34.474 --> 18:37.227
in the property of other people?

18:37.427 --> 18:41.380
Why should he be interested in getting the property of another person?

18:41.581 --> 18:44.071
He should not be. On the contrary he should be happy

18:44.271 --> 18:47.254
to see that somebody is happy, well-off with his children,

18:47.454 --> 18:51.871
enjoying a nice happy life.

18:52.071 --> 18:56.101
But there’s no end to this greed. The greed is so much

18:56.301 --> 19:01.171
that it’s impossible to call these people religious by any chance,

19:01.371 --> 19:05.049
and they are the ones who are talking on religion.

19:05.249 --> 19:08.955
Then the other side of it – not only the greed, the lust.

19:09.155 --> 19:15.333
The lust is so obvious,

19:15.533 --> 19:18.997
is so vivid

19:19.197 --> 19:26.348
that one cannot believe that these
people have anything to do with religion.

19:26.548 --> 19:29.751
So it follows with the superficiality,

19:29.952 --> 19:33.198
once you get materialistic.

19:33.399 --> 19:38.381
Then materialism also gives you certain ideas

19:38.581 --> 19:42.646
that you must have legs like this, you must have nose like that,

19:42.846 --> 19:45.802
you must have eyes like that, you must have body like that,

19:46.002 --> 19:48.818
so everybody starts working on that.

19:49.018 --> 19:52.955
In America in the morning if you get up, everybody is running on the streets,

19:53.156 --> 19:58.600
whether old or young. Some people
died of heart attacks on the streets.

19:58.801 --> 20:03.322
They said now they are having a new craze, what is it called as, jogging.

20:03.522 --> 20:05.826
And I had an Indian girl with Me,

20:06.034 --> 20:08.424
and she said – she woke Me up, she said, “Mother, get up, get up!”

20:08.624 --> 20:10.986
I said, “What has happened?” “Something gone wrong in this place.”

20:11.186 --> 20:15.240
I said, “Why?” “Everybody is running.”

20:15.440 --> 20:20.271
I said, “They are jogging.” “No, no, even old people are running.

20:20.471 --> 20:23.632
How can it be something like that?” I said, “It is, that’s their style.

20:23.832 --> 20:28.168
You forget it, let Me sleep!”

20:33.196 --> 20:43.511
Everything should be done in a way
to keep fit and to keep all right,

20:43.711 --> 20:48.276
but not just to sort of fall into the traps

20:48.476 --> 20:53.180
of these people who are spreading materialism.

20:56.476 --> 20:59.155
I told one lady – she was very thin already, and

20:59.356 --> 21:01.374
I said, “Why are you thinning more?”

21:01.575 --> 21:04.364
She said, “Because the modern clothes don’t fit you.”

21:04.564 --> 21:07.661
So I said, “Is it? It’s that according to the modern clothes

21:07.861 --> 21:10.348
you are going to make your body?” She said, “You have to,

21:10.548 --> 21:13.866
otherwise how will you wear the dresses?”

21:14.066 --> 21:16.827
I said, “This is horrid, absolutely horrid”,

21:17.027 --> 21:20.921
horrid system that they force people to wear the dresses,

21:21.121 --> 21:25.538
whatever their standards are.

21:25.738 --> 21:35.101
It has killed all the arts, all the
hand-made things, all the real things.

21:35.301 --> 21:39.992
It has brought everything artificial, everything superficial.

21:40.192 --> 21:44.226
The attention is so superficial. Just now I was watching a film,

21:44.426 --> 21:50.328
some sort of an American film: everybody was sick, everybody was mad.

21:50.528 --> 21:53.328
I mean, I couldn’t understand how could any human being

21:53.528 --> 21:58.570
behave like this? I have not known people like that Myself,

21:58.770 --> 22:01.441
but they showed a sick man behaving

22:01.642 --> 22:05.958
in a very sickly manner, supposed to be a hero.

22:06.158 --> 22:14.044
All these advertisements, all these newspapers, all this media,

22:14.244 --> 22:20.216
all of them are just here to create sensations in your body,

22:20.416 --> 22:24.848
some sort of a sensation. It has to be a sensational thing,

22:25.048 --> 22:28.825
because they think that you have become matter.

22:29.025 --> 22:36.005
Unless and until you give some shocks to the matter, it won’t move.

22:38.778 --> 22:41.859
And that is what they have brought you to,

22:42.059 --> 22:48.621
that’s where we have landed into – a state of matter.

22:48.821 --> 22:52.519
So we have no feelings, we just don’t talk to anyone,

22:52.719 --> 22:57.360
our hearts are frozen. We feel afraid to talk to human beings.

22:57.560 --> 23:01.517
We cannot tolerate our children.

23:01.717 --> 23:04.639
In London in every, every week

23:04.839 --> 23:07.616
– in London city, not I am saying England –

23:07.816 --> 23:11.944
they are killing two children every week.

23:12.144 --> 23:17.381
We have no love for our children, we can’t bear our children.

23:17.581 --> 23:21.983
We have no love for each other, no love for cooking,

23:22.183 --> 23:24.790
no love for doing something for your husband,

23:24.990 --> 23:27.720
husband has no love for doing anything for the wife.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.290
All the time what pictures they show is husband and wife fighting,

23:31.490 --> 23:37.789
all the time – how can there be? There’s no
love, there’s no affection, there’s no kindness.

23:37.989 --> 23:41.758
What is the fight going on? “Why did you spoil the carpet?”

23:41.958 --> 23:44.762
She said, “No, I didn’t spoil the carpet, the children spoilt it.”

23:44.962 --> 23:47.766
“Then why didn’t you clean it?” The fight is on –

23:47.966 --> 23:51.962
for what, for the carpet? What is this carpet?

23:52.162 --> 23:54.915
Is it a permanent stuff? But what is important,

23:55.115 --> 23:57.868
they have to sell the house tomorrow. They have to sell the house,

23:58.068 --> 24:01.347
the carpet must be neat, so everything is sellable,

24:01.547 --> 24:06.370
everything has to be sold, even the wife, husband, children, everything.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.335
They have to be made in such a way they are sellable all the time.

24:09.536 --> 24:12.050
Whatever you buy: you buy a diamond – all right,

24:12.250 --> 24:17.323
it should be sellable. If you want to buy anything precious

24:17.523 --> 24:21.316
it must be sellable, you’ll be surprised.

24:21.516 --> 24:24.855
So nobody can have something that is not standardized.

24:25.055 --> 24:28.276
All the rest, I don’t know, goes into waste I think in these countries.

24:28.476 --> 24:30.625
You have to have everything standardized.

24:30.825 --> 24:34.172
Nothing you can have for your own joy, for your own happiness,

24:34.372 --> 24:41.432
for your own using, for your own love for it.

24:41.632 --> 24:44.253
You give somebody some present, say for example

24:44.453 --> 24:48.300
you give somebody a gold ring, immediately that person will go

24:48.500 --> 24:57.852
to the shopkeeper and ask the jeweler: "Is it gold or not?"

24:58.052 --> 25:02.776
Whether it is, the price is all right or not,

25:02.976 --> 25:08.909
what carat gold – everything. They will
not see to the beauty of the thing.

25:09.109 --> 25:16.042
They will not see to the way the feelings are being expressed.

25:16.242 --> 25:19.698
What they will see is whether it is sellable or not.

25:19.898 --> 25:24.188
“Later on if I want to sell it, even the presents,

25:24.389 --> 25:28.424
if I can sell it it’s better to find out.”

25:28.624 --> 25:33.757
So the whole attitude towards life is that

25:33.958 --> 25:40.359
everything is valued in money, everything is valued in money.

25:40.559 --> 25:44.335
“What is the damage? How much it will cost?

25:44.535 --> 25:49.642
How much we have to pay? How much for the child-bearing?

25:49.842 --> 25:52.931
If you will have one child, how much it will cost?”

25:53.131 --> 25:59.240
Immediately they’ll go to the computer and find out how much it will cost.

26:03.497 --> 26:07.103
Now, like I’m speaking so I should find out

26:07.303 --> 26:10.790
how much it will cost My throat,

26:10.990 --> 26:15.236
that if I’m speaking so many words, like there’s a computer for it.

26:15.436 --> 26:17.970
You put in the computer, you’ll find out it will cost you

26:18.170 --> 26:24.691
five lozenges. All right, charge five lozenges to the Sahaja Yogis.

26:32.269 --> 26:37.668
There’s no feeling. Even they sing, when they walk,

26:37.868 --> 26:40.551
even when they do any work there’s no feeling

26:40.751 --> 26:42.860
and there’s no involvement at all,

26:43.061 --> 26:46.427
no involvement of any kind.

26:46.628 --> 26:52.319
The artistic work that was done before cannot be done today, why?

26:52.519 --> 26:56.668
It is because there is no feeling, there’s no involvement,

26:56.868 --> 27:03.049
there’s no feeling that, that "this is my work, I’m doing it;

27:03.249 --> 27:07.725
I’m doing it to present my own feelings,

27:07.926 --> 27:14.555
to express myself, it’s my own thing". There’s no feeling.

27:14.755 --> 27:20.445
Imagine, you have seen, so many of you have seen now Ajanta.

27:20.645 --> 27:25.977
This was built in ten centuries, cut from top to bottom.

27:26.177 --> 27:29.173
How they must have planned it? How they must have organized

27:29.373 --> 27:31.766
among themselves in ten generations?

27:31.966 --> 27:35.672
How they must have painted it? And there’s nothing,

27:35.872 --> 27:41.461
no city, nothing, no television, no food. How they lived there?

27:41.661 --> 27:49.053
They lived on dedication and love of Buddha, whom they had never seen.

27:49.990 --> 27:55.353
Such personalities they were, such involvement.

27:55.553 --> 28:02.408
Once they took up something they were absolutely dedicated with it.

28:02.608 --> 28:06.241
But such people are lost today because of materialism.

28:06.441 --> 28:09.843
Most important thing is how much money you get out of everything,

28:10.043 --> 28:15.351
there’s no end to it. And then what you take to is thieving.

28:15.551 --> 28:18.601
All these big, big people, the prime minister,

28:18.801 --> 28:23.726
today I was told that this Marcos, the great prime minister,

28:23.926 --> 28:31.801
Filipino fellow gave all his paintings to another thief from Riyad.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.044
They’re all thieves.

28:34.244 --> 28:39.952
All these big, big johnnies supposed to be there are thieves.

28:40.898 --> 28:46.884
Why? What are they lacking? What are they afraid of? Why do they do that?

28:47.085 --> 28:50.575
They are afraid that they’ll be
found out that they are thieves,

28:50.775 --> 28:53.318
so they are doing all these wrong things.

28:53.518 --> 28:56.786
They are collecting money because they know they have to run away one day.

28:56.986 --> 29:00.729
All right, so they must organize in such a way

29:00.930 --> 29:03.794
that they should have all these things planted in some place

29:03.994 --> 29:07.638
where they can always get hold of.

29:07.838 --> 29:10.341
But why become the thief first of all?

29:10.541 --> 29:13.696
You become the prime minister, make a name out of yourself,

29:13.896 --> 29:19.048
your history will remember you. No,
they cannot think of those things,

29:19.248 --> 29:23.255
they just think of the present.

29:23.614 --> 29:27.445
Sahaj way! It’s to make money.

29:27.645 --> 29:32.367
"When you are on the throne, make the money as much as is possible."

29:32.567 --> 29:35.755
This money is going to bring them bad name.

29:35.955 --> 29:38.771
In the progeny they will not be remembered,

29:38.971 --> 29:41.904
people will not take their names. If they take their names,

29:42.104 --> 29:47.164
they will have a headache. So what’s
the use of leading such a life?

29:47.364 --> 29:53.236
Even today human beings in general are not so degenerated

29:53.436 --> 29:57.049
that they put statues of a drunkard

29:57.249 --> 30:00.994
or statues of a man who has been a thief,

30:01.194 --> 30:07.152
who has been managing the whole country
and selling it off to somebody else.

30:07.352 --> 30:13.113
There are no statues of such people. Nobody remembers them.

30:13.313 --> 30:19.115
People don’t like them, such people are hated.

30:22.100 --> 30:26.075
And even if there are statues of such people – I’ve seen that of Stalin –

30:26.275 --> 30:30.720
they remove them.

30:34.360 --> 30:40.972
So this idea of materialism has grown like a ghost now

30:41.172 --> 30:47.009
into the minds of people, that matter is more important;

30:47.209 --> 30:53.107
that materially if you are all right, you are all right.

30:53.793 --> 31:01.039
The other side of it is that you must
show that you don’t care for matter,

31:01.239 --> 31:05.310
that you are not bothered, like these anti-culture people.

31:05.510 --> 31:10.279
But no, materialism is within them, it is engrained in them,

31:10.479 --> 31:14.864
it’s in their blood, they can’t get out of it.

31:15.064 --> 31:18.942
By showing off that "we make our hair in such a manner

31:19.142 --> 31:22.669
that we don’t need a barber",

31:22.869 --> 31:27.695
or else "we dress up with dirty clothes with holes in it

31:27.895 --> 31:32.867
to show that we don’t care for matter", it’s not so.

31:33.067 --> 31:38.639
By changing the matter you do not change the inside within yourself.

31:38.839 --> 31:44.823
Inside is changed when you look at the matter as a witness.

31:45.568 --> 31:51.118
Matter has a purpose. You should
know the purpose of the matter.

31:51.318 --> 31:55.143
If you know the purpose of the matter then you have value,

31:55.343 --> 31:59.339
your value system is correct. For example, this has its own purpose:

31:59.539 --> 32:04.839
it has a purpose that it must deliver the lecture properly.

32:05.039 --> 32:08.952
But if this purpose is not served, it is no good.

32:09.152 --> 32:12.062
In the same way everything has a purpose.

32:12.262 --> 32:18.289
What’s the use of buying fifty artificial blouses,

32:18.489 --> 32:26.241
or thirty-two thousand shoes as this lady had, Mrs. Marcos,

32:26.441 --> 32:30.725
when she’s not going to use even two out of them?

32:30.925 --> 32:34.623
It has no feeling, it has no meaning, it’s selfishness,

32:34.823 --> 32:41.032
it’s self-centeredness. It’s thinking about yourself all the time.

32:42.861 --> 32:46.107
Now you want to give Me a sari.

32:46.307 --> 32:49.162
In Marathi it is called as “pot zakaych,”

32:49.362 --> 32:55.193
means they’re covering the womb of the
Goddess, the stomach of the Mother.

32:55.393 --> 32:59.375
Because She’s put us there, She has given us birth,

32:59.575 --> 33:02.977
so we must give Her something to cover it,

33:03.177 --> 33:06.510
is a very humble way of saying it.

33:06.710 --> 33:10.119
Now you give Me a sari,

33:10.319 --> 33:14.486
I don’t know when I’m going to wear all these, but whatever it is,

33:14.686 --> 33:17.702
just give Me a sari with a feeling,

33:17.902 --> 33:23.311
and maybe I may never wear it, I may wear it also.

33:23.511 --> 33:28.844
But the progeny will see what you have given to your Mother.

33:29.045 --> 33:32.730
I’m not going to carry it with Me, nobody’s going to carry the matter with them.

33:32.930 --> 33:38.592
But it had a purpose, it had a
meaning, it had emotions behind it.

33:38.792 --> 33:42.873
It was given in a puja when so many people gathered,

33:43.073 --> 33:47.334
you gave to your Mother. When people
will see it they’ll be so very happy,

33:47.534 --> 33:50.420
“Oh, the Sydney people gave this,”

33:50.620 --> 33:54.545
or “the Australians gave on this Sahasrara Day.”

33:54.745 --> 33:58.585
See, even the vibrations flow.

33:58.785 --> 34:01.491
Just that, this is what it is.

34:01.691 --> 34:09.074
Now, it has no purpose if you put something up

34:09.274 --> 34:13.934
in a puja which is not necessary.

34:14.134 --> 34:17.697
It has no purpose at all, it has no feeling,

34:17.897 --> 34:20.736
it has no meaning. It is valueless.

34:20.936 --> 34:28.083
For example if you put this up, say, into My bathroom, it is useless.

34:28.708 --> 34:34.112
Specially this one,

34:34.312 --> 34:39.632
because I can’t even sing there.

34:41.491 --> 34:46.284
Quite frightening. Thank God it’s being screened

34:46.484 --> 34:50.124
by Sahaja yogis because they know My conditions, you see,

34:50.324 --> 34:54.062
but it’s so sweet to see the way they have covered it,

34:54.262 --> 34:56.280
because they know their Mother would be quite nervous

34:56.480 --> 35:02.146
to have a bath in a glass bathroom.

35:02.346 --> 35:05.826
That’s all. That shows, you see, that feeling,

35:06.026 --> 35:10.017
that understanding about Me. That fills My heart

35:10.217 --> 35:17.474
with such love, such oneness with you
that you understand Me,

35:17.675 --> 35:21.723
that "Mother may not like, you see, this kind of a glass business."

35:21.923 --> 35:26.012
It’s so sweet to do those things for Me.

35:26.212 --> 35:29.895
Little, little things here and there, whatever we do for others

35:30.095 --> 35:35.934
are so suggestive of our love, of our feelings.

35:36.134 --> 35:41.431
And this is what you have to express today, not the materialism.

35:42.829 --> 35:48.188
We don’t have to express that, that we were very rich people

35:48.388 --> 35:53.095
or that we had lots of diamonds and we had ornaments, nothing.

35:53.295 --> 35:58.329
That is not needed. No, we were people of great feelings.

35:58.529 --> 36:06.070
What they brought for Christ was leaves of palm, palm tree;

36:06.270 --> 36:12.609
singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” like the way you were singing today.

36:12.809 --> 36:16.551
What these palm trees are? Even today they are remembered.

36:16.751 --> 36:27.041
They’ll be remembered eternally, the
palm trees that were used for this.

36:27.986 --> 36:33.107
They didn’t think about it, they
didn’t know what to get at that time.

36:33.307 --> 36:35.802
Whatever was available they got it,

36:36.002 --> 36:40.374
and started singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” to Christ.

36:40.574 --> 36:44.733
All these little, little things become so important,

36:44.933 --> 36:48.344
because you have given value to it.

36:48.544 --> 36:58.674
A little piece, a little clay if you take and put art into it,

36:58.874 --> 37:02.526
put your feelings into it, then that becomes expensive.

37:02.726 --> 37:08.522
Even economics can show that it has become more expensive.

37:08.722 --> 37:16.764
But if you give with feelings and if
you give it to someone with your love,

37:16.964 --> 37:26.456
even that adds to the value; to that person it’s very valuable.

37:32.760 --> 37:39.430
It is remarkable sometimes how little things

37:39.630 --> 37:44.399
just move the whole ocean of My love

37:44.599 --> 37:50.879
into a turbulent, happy, joyous, loving heart.

37:51.079 --> 37:55.754
I sometimes feel that how these little things that they do

37:55.954 --> 38:00.347
and care for Me, express their love,

38:00.547 --> 38:07.352
just moves Me to the highest point of joy.

38:09.385 --> 38:13.974
Then it’s not the matter that is important,

38:14.174 --> 38:18.133
it’s not how much you have spent is important,

38:18.333 --> 38:23.540
it’s not how it has been brought is important.

38:23.740 --> 38:27.829
What is important is how much thought you have given to it;

38:28.029 --> 38:32.954
and that is what is lacking, that there is no thought.

38:33.154 --> 38:37.850
We think, but we do not give thought – it’s two things,

38:38.050 --> 38:41.885
different. We just go on thinking, thinking, doing nothing.

38:42.086 --> 38:48.225
And to give a thought to a thing
is a sign of depth and understanding.

38:48.425 --> 38:54.342
When the matter is given thought, then it becomes important.

38:54.542 --> 38:59.363
Without the thought it is useless, it is sellable all the time,

38:59.563 --> 39:03.434
everything is sellable.

39:03.634 --> 39:07.230
It has no meaning, it has no value.

39:07.430 --> 39:11.048
I hope you will all get out of this ghost,

39:11.248 --> 39:17.377
and get out of the clutches of these
entrepreneurs who are trying to ruin you.

39:17.577 --> 39:24.757
Try to have things which are full of feelings,

39:24.957 --> 39:29.286
which are having some meaning,

39:29.486 --> 39:37.427
and also try to give it to others things which can express your love.

39:37.627 --> 39:44.731
Matter has one great value, that through
matter you can express your love,

39:44.931 --> 39:49.276
you can express your feelings for a person.

39:49.476 --> 39:54.480
Now today at the last minute I was just struggling to get

39:54.680 --> 39:57.300
some presents for you;

39:57.500 --> 40:01.548
I mean, it was such a struggle, you can’t imagine.

40:01.748 --> 40:05.908
I was in a big mess there,

40:06.108 --> 40:10.310
the house was in a mess and all kinds of things happening,

40:10.510 --> 40:13.279
the puja in the morning.

40:13.479 --> 40:17.967
Until about twelve o’clock I could not leave Pune.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.928
So there was no question of buying anything in Bombay.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.749
So I had to do in a very short time

40:23.949 --> 40:30.180
through other people’s help some sort of purchases,

40:30.380 --> 40:33.242
and I’ve been able to buy some few things for you,

40:33.442 --> 40:38.125
so please accept them as a token of My love for you.

40:38.325 --> 40:42.306
Moreover I’ve brought some mangoes, quite a lot of them,

40:42.506 --> 40:48.337
and this your custom authorities have taken them away.

40:48.537 --> 40:50.653
I was very unhappy and they could see that.

40:50.853 --> 40:53.247
I said, “What’s this, are you going to eat these mangoes?”

40:53.447 --> 40:55.509
They said, “No, we are going to fumigate.”

40:55.710 --> 40:57.840
I said, “After fumigation you give it to us,

40:58.041 --> 41:02.496
for My children I’ve brought.” So they understood it and they agreed.

41:02.697 --> 41:05.968
So I hope we get the mangoes for you on Monday.

41:06.168 --> 41:09.345
After all it’s a small thing, but after all

41:09.545 --> 41:15.106
this is the time for you to eat mangoes.

41:25.778 --> 41:29.528
Have you got the presents here? ….

41:47.110 --> 41:52.855
So I have left it to James’ wisdom to name them for people

41:53.055 --> 41:55.925
whom he wanted to give the presents,

41:56.125 --> 42:01.303
and we have smuggled them nicely into your country.

42:01.503 --> 42:09.194
Because we had a mango problem, they allowed us to bring the rest of it!
