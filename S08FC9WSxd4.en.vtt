WEBVTT

07:16.083 --> 07:19.292
Thank you very much.

08:01.633 --> 08:05.925
I bow to all the seekers of truth!

08:14.101 --> 08:19.851
It is to be understood that truth is what it is.

08:21.143 --> 08:25.725
We cannot conceptualize it.

08:34.476 --> 08:36.642
We cannot achieve it

08:36.851 --> 08:40.684
by our human efforts or mental projections.

08:45.393 --> 08:51.393
We have to reach into a higher state to know it,

08:53.809 --> 08:55.976
to know it.

08:58.976 --> 09:03.059
The song that they sung just now,

09:03.351 --> 09:08.059
was written in the year sixteen hundred in India,

09:08.268 --> 09:12.226
by a very famous poet, Namadeva,

09:12.434 --> 09:15.434
who was a tailor.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.851
Loudly.

09:27.101 --> 09:29.892
In the sixteenth century.

09:33.143 --> 09:37.560
And they have been singing the song in the villages of India,

09:38.476 --> 09:41.476
with the same folk tune.

09:50.641 --> 09:52.976
It says that

09:53.184 --> 09:57.476
“I will ask for Yoga, that is the union with the Divine,

09:57.642 --> 09:59.809
from Mother”.

10:05.560 --> 10:10.393
"Ai" is the Mother. “I’ll ask the Mother to give me the Yoga”.

10:15.476 --> 10:19.184
And the “Ude, ude Ambe!” means that

10:19.393 --> 10:25.518
“O, Mother Kundalini, please rise, ude, ude, please rise!

10:35.560 --> 10:38.226
So this knowledge of our roots was known

10:38.434 --> 10:40.641
to many people all over the world,

10:40.809 --> 10:44.642
especially in India, to many saints.

10:58.017 --> 11:03.641
This Namadeva once went to meet another saint,

11:03.809 --> 11:09.143
who was a potter, making things out of clay.

11:17.641 --> 11:20.767
His name was Gora.

11:22.309 --> 11:25.143
He saw him and then he says,

11:25.351 --> 11:28.892
in very beautiful couplet he describes

11:29.101 --> 11:32.393
this personality of a potter.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.601
He says, “I came here,

11:46.725 --> 11:53.017
to see the formless,  that is this All-pervading Power.

11:54.143 --> 11:58.351
But I see It  in person, in form.”

12:14.059 --> 12:18.725
And he embraced with great joy!

12:23.518 --> 12:26.767
This is the acknowledgement.

12:26.976 --> 12:31.892
This is the knowledge of a saint about another saint.

12:38.393 --> 12:41.393
There is no jealousy,

12:41.642 --> 12:44.518
there is no competition,

12:44.684 --> 12:49.268
there is no knowledge to be asked about the person.

12:52.434 --> 12:55.976
Just through this

12:56.601 --> 13:00.809
emission of vibrations, of cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

13:05.641 --> 13:08.934
you can understand who is the saint.

13:13.601 --> 13:17.017
So the time has come for us to know the truth.

13:17.268 --> 13:19.101
I call it the “Blossom time”,

13:19.309 --> 13:22.892
when there are so many people who are seeking the truth.

13:36.393 --> 13:41.184
Of course, it’s a living process of a living energy

13:41.393 --> 13:43.601
of living God.

13:49.934 --> 13:54.641
You cannot pay for anything that is living process.

13:58.351 --> 14:01.934
Like we sprout a seed in the Mother Earth,

14:02.309 --> 14:06.184
your Kundalini sprouts, spontaneously.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.725
And you get the blessings of the Divine Power.

14:23.351 --> 14:26.351
It is an All-pervading divine Power,

14:26.560 --> 14:30.101
about which all the Scriptures have talked.

14:38.393 --> 14:43.642
Essence of all the religions is that, "seek the Eternal".

14:49.268 --> 14:52.892
And transitory, is to be treated, with understanding,

14:53.101 --> 14:56.101
in its own limitations.

15:07.184 --> 15:11.268
But, when we see the problems of

15:11.476 --> 15:14.184
religion and religious people,

15:14.393 --> 15:18.143
we start wondering, what is this all about?

15:26.767 --> 15:31.934
One may be a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, any religion,

15:32.184 --> 15:35.976
commits any sin, there is no bounding on him.

15:51.393 --> 15:56.434
Nobody says, that “See, I am of this religion,

15:56.641 --> 15:59.641
I can’t commit this mistake”.

16:10.642 --> 16:13.642
Then on one side you see the fanaticism.

16:18.101 --> 16:21.684
And another side, you see people criticizing God

16:22.309 --> 16:26.059
and all the great prophets,

16:31.601 --> 16:34.601
because they don’t understand Divinity.

16:37.476 --> 16:43.476
And this has lead to a great confusion in this modern times.

16:48.809 --> 16:52.684
So, we have to ascend and know the Absolute

16:57.976 --> 17:00.976
and the absolute truth.

17:03.143 --> 17:05.725
In the West, as you see,

17:05.934 --> 17:08.725
we have so many modern things,

17:08.934 --> 17:13.351
and we have evolved like a tree outside.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.309
But we do not know our roots.

17:26.518 --> 17:31.309
Unless and until the tree knows the roots,

17:34.351 --> 17:38.601
there is always a danger of its destruction.

17:39.268 --> 17:42.434
That’s why we have problems today of ecology.

17:43.268 --> 17:49.434
We have problems of AIDS, drugs, all other extreme things.

18:03.434 --> 18:06.434
We have no balance.

18:08.393 --> 18:13.059
Machines we make, they are for us, we are not for machines.

18:21.059 --> 18:25.101
We discovered science for us, not for science.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.684
We are the masters.

18:33.184 --> 18:38.351
Why should there be problems within us and without?

18:44.684 --> 18:47.684
Also we find we are not integrated.

18:53.560 --> 18:58.641
There is a very little problem, that is,

18:58.809 --> 19:01.809
we do not know the Absolute.

19:07.641 --> 19:12.767
And Absolute is the truth for everyone.

19:17.934 --> 19:21.976
You become part and parcel of the whole.

19:27.393 --> 19:30.641
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

19:34.268 --> 19:37.059
Like this hand feels the pain

19:37.268 --> 19:40.434
and another just comes to soothe it,

19:40.641 --> 19:43.976
automatically, spontaneously.

19:53.268 --> 19:56.601
This hand doesn’t give pain to this hand.

19:56.851 --> 19:59.934
does not want to hurt it.

20:05.226 --> 20:09.268
This transformation has to take place among human beings.

20:13.518 --> 20:17.434
Then all barriers will drop and dissolve.

20:24.101 --> 20:28.351
And we’ll realize that we are created by one Creator,

20:31.851 --> 20:35.560
and the whole world is One.

20:36.101 --> 20:43.017
But just by having foundations of peace,

20:43.226 --> 20:45.934
foundations of cooperation,

20:46.143 --> 20:50.476
is all mental. It's not going to help us.

21:03.059 --> 21:06.518
This transformation has to take within ourselves,

21:06.725 --> 21:09.725
to solve our problems.

21:14.851 --> 21:18.684
But as a result of this happening, you are empowered

21:18.892 --> 21:23.767
that you can give Realizations to others and transform others.

21:34.892 --> 21:37.684
You are empowered that you can cure others

21:37.892 --> 21:41.143
and you can give comfort to others.

21:46.268 --> 21:49.309
You are empowered that you can council others

21:49.518 --> 21:52.601
about reality.

21:59.518 --> 22:03.725
Above all, you become peace yourself.

22:07.809 --> 22:09.809
You feel your peace

22:10.017 --> 22:14.226
and wherever you go, you emit peace and bliss.

22:19.393 --> 22:22.767
You become joy,

22:23.268 --> 22:26.393
and wherever you go, you emit joy.

22:28.642 --> 22:33.393
Joy, which has no duality of unhappiness and happiness.

22:37.725 --> 22:41.268
It seems fantastic.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.518
But human beings are fantastic.

22:46.101 --> 22:49.226
They don’t know their glory, they are not aware of it.

22:53.351 --> 22:57.017
Say, for example, this instrument is not put to the mains,

22:57.226 --> 23:00.184
it has no meaning.

23:06.101 --> 23:08.309
People are trying to find their meanings.

23:08.518 --> 23:11.393
First get connected to the whole.

23:18.641 --> 23:22.976
One has to make connected to this All-pervading Power,

23:23.184 --> 23:28.268
which is a subtle power, which does all living things.

23:39.892 --> 23:42.601
We see the flowers and we see

23:42.767 --> 23:46.892
that the trees have different fruits.

23:47.101 --> 23:50.309
Who does the choices and who makes all that?

24:04.059 --> 24:06.767
Just look at our eyes itself,

24:07.017 --> 24:10.560
are the best camera as that you could think of.

24:15.393 --> 24:19.518
We are already programmed to be a computer.

24:19.684 --> 24:22.684
We don’t think, it just works.

24:28.684 --> 24:32.101
But now you have to become the divine computer.

24:37.393 --> 24:40.017
Unless and until that happens,

24:40.226 --> 24:45.518
we'll have all the problems and more problems and more problems.

24:53.184 --> 24:56.518
So, we have to be that powerful personality,

24:56.684 --> 25:00.976
that compassionate personality, that dynamic personality.

25:08.725 --> 25:10.892
And powerful.

25:12.767 --> 25:16.143
And you should know all about your powers, too.

25:19.976 --> 25:23.268
All this is absolutely easy.

25:26.351 --> 25:29.642
We have lots of time, we have watches on,

25:29.851 --> 25:33.476
to save the time, but where do we waste it?

25:38.476 --> 25:40.851
If we could say,

25:41.268 --> 25:45.851
if you could spend some time on ourselves,

25:51.059 --> 25:53.976
then we don’t even need a watch. It works.

25:57.601 --> 25:59.725
And then you enter into the Kingdom of God,

25:59.934 --> 26:02.059
which is miraculous.

26:06.641 --> 26:10.684
And miracles of every kind, you see and you are amazed.

26:15.684 --> 26:18.976
So many here are Sahaja Yogis, all over the world.

26:19.184 --> 26:21.892
It is working now in thirty nations.

26:22.101 --> 26:27.268
And they all can tell you so many miracles.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.976
In India... All right.

26:45.809 --> 26:50.393
In India we have the University of Delhi,

26:50.601 --> 26:54.809
which has recognized Sahaja Yoga, for the course of MD

26:55.017 --> 26:57.476
and three doctors have submitted

26:57.642 --> 27:00.851
their thesis for it and have got it through.

27:05.518 --> 27:07.892
For doctors.

27:15.851 --> 27:20.434
And they have done subjects like physical fitness,

27:20.641 --> 27:24.017
and psychosomatic diseases like cancer,

27:24.809 --> 27:27.518
and thirdly, epilepsy.

27:33.059 --> 27:35.393
Psychosomatic.

27:37.393 --> 27:42.059
And physical, physical abilities, physical fitness.

27:45.976 --> 27:52.268
So it is for us to know about oneself

27:53.476 --> 27:56.684
and to enjoy ourselves and others.

28:07.309 --> 28:09.601
It is not frivolous

28:10.725 --> 28:13.725
and it is not serious.

28:14.351 --> 28:18.518
It is mirth and joy, mirth.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.434
What is mirth Mother?

28:24.601 --> 28:26.809
Mirth is fun.

28:27.017 --> 28:30.059
No word in French?

28:31.268 --> 28:35.725
I’m sorry, so now we'll have to introduce new word in French.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.184
When I first came on My program,

28:51.434 --> 28:54.684
I had one Sahaja Yogini in London,

28:54.892 --> 28:56.934
and when I first came, she told Me that,

28:57.143 --> 29:00.309
“Mother, You should not smile at all,

29:00.642 --> 29:06.560
because French think that life is all misery”.

29:26.351 --> 29:31.017
And that, ”If you do not feel sorry,

29:31.309 --> 29:33.184
then they’ll think you are ignoramus,

29:33.393 --> 29:36.393
you don’t know anything about the world.”

29:37.725 --> 29:40.309
Ignoramus, ignorant.

29:43.184 --> 29:46.976
No, no, no, that I am a ignoramus, if I'm not miserable.

29:58.934 --> 30:02.560
I'd read a novel of Victor Hugo, “Les miserable”,

30:02.725 --> 30:06.476
and I started with that to them, "dear les miserable".

30:11.184 --> 30:14.226
So that is not so.

30:15.226 --> 30:18.017
The Creator, who has created this creation,

30:18.226 --> 30:21.309
will never allow it to be destroyed.

30:27.268 --> 30:31.892
He has created you, also, so beautifully, so carefully,

30:32.101 --> 30:35.309
and everything is laid down within you.

30:45.059 --> 30:48.184
Whatever may be the past, please forget it.

30:51.268 --> 30:54.393
And the future doesn’t exist.

30:55.393 --> 30:59.226
In the present you all are going to get your Self-Realization.

31:03.143 --> 31:07.684
May God bless you all!

31:09.809 --> 31:12.725
Should I ask them to ask questions or something?

31:15.143 --> 31:18.434
Because that it prolongs a lot. What do you say?

31:20.226 --> 31:22.641
I should ask? All right.

31:22.809 --> 31:25.851
Now, if you want to ask Me some questions, please do.

31:26.059 --> 31:30.226
But by asking questions and knowing the answers,

31:30.434 --> 31:33.434
the Kundalini does not rise.

31:54.143 --> 31:57.268
I am telling you the truth.

31:59.226 --> 32:02.309
If you have any questions, you can ask Me.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.976
[unclear]

32:15.725 --> 32:18.268
It seems to be all interested of their Realization, Mother.

32:18.518 --> 32:21.518
No question?

32:24.892 --> 32:27.892
There's one gentleman there.

32:35.684 --> 32:39.684
He is saying, do You think, Mother, that the technique of Japa

32:39.892 --> 32:41.851
is very good for Self-Realization?

32:42.059 --> 32:44.601
No, my child, no.

32:47.309 --> 32:51.976
You see, the Japa is,

32:53.684 --> 32:58.226
they give you some name or something to recite.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.351
Now, it’s like a car.

33:05.309 --> 33:08.309
If it is ignited,

33:09.767 --> 33:13.725
if it is ignited and when it starts moving,

33:13.934 --> 33:17.184
you know where is the obstruction.

33:32.101 --> 33:34.934
Supposing I am in London,

33:35.143 --> 33:38.184
and I have to come to Paris.

33:39.101 --> 33:42.059
Now, on the way, I’ve not moved out at all.

33:42.268 --> 33:44.684
Sitting in London if I say

33:44.892 --> 33:48.684
“Open the door of Paris”, what is the use?

34:02.351 --> 34:05.184
Like the Kundalini has to rise.

34:05.393 --> 34:08.309
And passes through six centers.

34:08.518 --> 34:11.642
And any center, which is closed,

34:11.851 --> 34:16.725
that you can find out, we can find out, they can find out.

34:17.641 --> 34:20.684
Then we'll we have to of course

34:21.017 --> 34:23.434
say something which I will show you, just now,

34:23.601 --> 34:25.976
during meditation, just now,

34:26.226 --> 34:31.017
while your Kundalini will be rising. But the Kundalini must act.

34:56.434 --> 34:58.892
Moreover...

34:59.809 --> 35:04.434
Moreover, supposing I want to meet Mr. Mitterrand, all right?

35:07.560 --> 35:09.725
Now, for meeting him,

35:09.934 --> 35:13.393
supposing I go to his door and start shouting,

35:13.642 --> 35:17.143
“Oh, Mitterrand, Mitterrand, Mitterrand.”

35:24.017 --> 35:27.059
The police will arrest Me.

35:28.641 --> 35:32.226
I must take permission, I must have the protocol,

35:32.434 --> 35:34.684
I should be allowed to go inside,

35:34.892 --> 35:37.892
othewise it's not proper.

35:43.434 --> 35:45.059
In the same way if you say,

35:45.268 --> 35:48.309
if you take the name of anyone of the Deities,

35:48.518 --> 35:53.143
without Kundalini awakening, without proper protocol,

35:53.976 --> 35:56.642
the doors are closed. Not only that,

35:56.851 --> 36:01.226
but these chakras get spoilt, you get arrested.

36:14.351 --> 36:16.934
If it is with the president,

36:17.143 --> 36:20.184
I am talking about God All-mighty,

36:20.393 --> 36:23.767
who is the President of all the presidents.

36:31.601 --> 36:35.684
So, how can you do it? This is unauthorized.

36:52.642 --> 36:54.143
All right?

37:01.476 --> 37:04.059
Is it possible...?

37:17.226 --> 37:20.184
He's asking Mother, it's possible to be connected with the Divine,

37:20.351 --> 37:21.767
Is it possible?

37:21.934 --> 37:25.560
To be connected with the Divine without Kundalini awakening?

37:25.725 --> 37:32.351
No. You cannot create a tree without sprouting the seed.

37:43.434 --> 37:47.476
That’s what Christ has said: “Know thyself”.

37:51.641 --> 37:54.725
Without the Kundalini you cannot know yourself.

37:57.641 --> 38:03.101
This is described as the Tree of Life, in the Bible.

38:11.892 --> 38:15.101
What about Pranayama and Hatha Yoga?

38:16.601 --> 38:20.725
Pranayama is not going to help you, at all.

38:21.393 --> 38:24.641
Is a, you see, it's more physical.

38:24.892 --> 38:28.560
And we do pranayama, also, in Sahaja Yoga,

38:28.725 --> 38:33.017
but it is a very scientific, whenever it is necessary.

38:33.226 --> 38:39.226
Here the people do all these pranayama and all these yoga

38:39.892 --> 38:43.560
things as if taking all the medicines from the medicine-box,

38:43.725 --> 38:46.101
without a doctor.

39:08.601 --> 39:11.184
The best way to know is this way.

39:11.393 --> 39:14.809
You must have seen many people who are doing pranayama,

39:15.017 --> 39:16.934
who are doing yoga.

39:17.143 --> 39:19.309
What do you do, they do, when they run too much,

39:19.434 --> 39:21.101
what is it called in America?

39:21.226 --> 39:22.476
Jogging.

39:22.725 --> 39:25.851
Ha, they do jogging.

39:26.351 --> 39:29.434
Oh, they all run like mad, everybody runs.

39:29.641 --> 39:33.268
Everybody is running, all as if there's an earthquaqe,

39:33.351 --> 39:36.934
whether it is old, young, anything, everybody is running in America.

39:37.101 --> 39:40.560
So, anything you do,

39:41.393 --> 39:43.309
you must find out,

39:43.518 --> 39:47.934
what is the transformation that has come in that person?

40:13.809 --> 40:17.017
Is there, are they sweet people,

40:17.226 --> 40:21.143
are they joyous, are they peaceful?

40:25.268 --> 40:27.226
Hatha yogis are such that,

40:27.434 --> 40:29.851
if they come from this door, better run away from the other,

40:30.059 --> 40:33.059
the way they are horrid and hot temper.

40:36.268 --> 40:39.268
I know some.

40:40.725 --> 40:44.059
Mostly they divorce their wives, give up their children,

40:44.268 --> 40:47.351
there is no sweetness.

41:00.641 --> 41:02.892
Hitler was a Hatha Yogi, do you know that?

41:03.101 --> 41:06.309
And a follower of a Lama. Double.

41:07.184 --> 41:09.476
And a follower of a Lama.

41:22.934 --> 41:25.934
Not this one, another one.

41:26.143 --> 41:29.351
All right. There is another one gentleman asked.

41:29.601 --> 41:32.601
So you asked one question.

41:34.809 --> 41:36.393
What he is saying?

41:36.601 --> 41:39.017
He is asking what do you think of Bhakta Yoga?

41:39.226 --> 41:40.851
Hatha Yogi?

41:41.101 --> 41:43.059
Bhakti Yoga.

41:43.143 --> 41:46.017
Who is Bhakta Yogi, I don’t know. What do you think?

41:46.268 --> 41:49.976
Is the point.There are all kinds of bhakta, sakta, kata.

41:50.184 --> 41:52.934
But how am I to know all of them?

41:53.725 --> 41:58.767
Only thing I can say that you just see yourself.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.184
You can know yourself.

42:10.641 --> 42:13.934
You must know that Indians can be very cunning people,

42:14.143 --> 42:15.309
I’m sorry to say.

42:15.518 --> 42:20.184
Because we have had three hundred years the company of the English.

42:35.184 --> 42:39.725
Anything for which you have to pay, is all falsehood.

42:45.518 --> 42:48.641
That is as simple, very simple!

42:57.268 --> 43:01.017
You people are very vulnerable because you are seekers.

43:08.851 --> 43:13.641
So be careful, don’t get lost!

43:26.641 --> 43:31.184
How do we protect ourselves from negative vibrations, if we have?

43:31.393 --> 43:33.809
How do we protect ourselves from negative vibrations?

43:34.017 --> 43:36.851
That we’ll tell you everything,

43:37.059 --> 43:39.642
and we’ll be having a course.

43:41.642 --> 43:44.560
You’ll be expert.

43:44.725 --> 43:48.641
And no negative forces will come near you. They'll all run away.

43:53.059 --> 43:55.143
One day they'll run away from Paris

43:55.268 --> 43:57.309
and then from the whole of France.

44:26.641 --> 44:32.101
Let’s have it now. It’s there one more lady, there.

44:48.143 --> 44:51.476
She's asking [unclear] because once we achieve the complete

44:51.560 --> 44:55.434
the complete [unclear] we are deviating

44:55.851 --> 44:59.351
compared to others, you know, in respect to others, because

44:59.684 --> 45:02.892
others do not understand that.

45:03.226 --> 45:07.184
They will understand. Everybody understands love.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.226
All right, let's have it.

45:32.143 --> 45:34.226
It's he a Hatha yogi?

45:36.226 --> 45:40.059
He is a seeker, all right, all right. Ask the question.

45:40.767 --> 45:43.767
If he is a seeker, he has a right!

45:44.641 --> 45:47.684
What do you think of these Krishna movement, Mother?

45:47.809 --> 45:49.767
Krishna who?

45:49.976 --> 45:53.518
I mean you yourself judge.

45:57.101 --> 46:01.351
In India, when we get up, we take the Rama’s name,

46:02.017 --> 46:06.017
when we say somebody as “Good Morning”, we say "Ram",

46:06.809 --> 46:11.101
“Good evening”, "Ram". What have we achieved?

46:24.226 --> 46:30.601
Krishna is supposed to be Kubera, is the Lord of wealth,

46:31.351 --> 46:34.641
and his disciples are begging on the streets.

46:34.934 --> 46:37.143
How can that be?

47:40.725 --> 47:43.351
What he is saying?

47:50.226 --> 47:52.518
Someone who doesn't know anything about Kundalini,

47:52.641 --> 47:53.892
can he get his Realization?

47:53.976 --> 47:58.642
Of course. That’s much better!

48:02.226 --> 48:05.976
That’s much better. Much better.

48:06.184 --> 48:08.934
That’s innocence.

48:09.143 --> 48:15.184
Those who know about it, are mostly very crooked people.

48:41.601 --> 48:44.393
They misuse it.

48:49.851 --> 48:52.601
They frighten people.

48:56.560 --> 49:00.226
Actually there is nothing to be known about Kundalini.

49:04.059 --> 49:07.976
But you see, you know French people, you cannot just ask them,

49:08.184 --> 49:09.725
to take their Realization.

49:09.934 --> 49:13.476
You have to tell them something about it, after all.

49:24.184 --> 49:26.934
Like, when you come in this room,

49:27.143 --> 49:30.767
if you have to put the lights, you just switch on one light.

49:31.101 --> 49:34.101
You don’t have to tell what is the history,

49:34.434 --> 49:38.560
how it came in, what is the source, you see.

49:39.143 --> 49:43.226
But, if it’s a French man, you may have to tell little bit.

50:06.767 --> 50:08.226
All right.

50:16.351 --> 50:18.892
There are two conditions.

50:19.143 --> 50:22.226
One condition is that,

50:22.434 --> 50:26.059
we are not to feel guilty at all, forget the past.

50:33.641 --> 50:38.976
Second condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

50:43.268 --> 50:45.767
Because both things are myths.

50:48.184 --> 50:51.976
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

50:56.851 --> 51:00.725
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

51:06.934 --> 51:09.476
So don’t say it is difficult. Is the easiest thing to say,

51:09.642 --> 51:11.767
“I forgive”, everytime.

51:17.684 --> 51:20.434
Ones you forgive, the Divine takes over.

51:26.725 --> 51:30.101
So, you have to have these two conditions fulfilled.

51:36.017 --> 51:39.351
If you want to have Self-Realization,

51:39.601 --> 51:44.309
you all have to help to raise your Kundalini,

51:44.518 --> 51:46.101
as I'll tell you.

51:46.309 --> 51:49.017
But, if you don’t want to have, I cannot force you.

51:49.226 --> 51:53.226
It's in your freedom and in your glory, you have to get it.

52:08.184 --> 52:10.851
So all such people, if they don’t want,

52:11.059 --> 52:14.351
they can leave the hall, you cannot force.

52:26.641 --> 52:29.226
Now, we have to take the help of the Mother Earth,

52:29.434 --> 52:32.976
so if you don’t mind, you'll have to take out your shoes.

52:58.725 --> 53:01.518
And you have to sit comfortably,

53:01.684 --> 53:06.642
with both the legs, both the feet apart from each other.

53:15.642 --> 53:20.641
Tomorrow, tomorrow I will tell you more about the

53:20.851 --> 53:24.143
left and right channel, and two energies,

53:24.351 --> 53:29.518
but today remember, that left and right are two energies within us.

53:47.518 --> 53:52.143
So, we put our left hand like this, towards Me,

53:54.892 --> 53:59.560
and the right hand we have to use for the action.

54:00.725 --> 54:02.641
You come up, come.

54:02.809 --> 54:06.309
I'll stand up, I think. Can you put it up?

54:20.268 --> 54:24.059
First I will show you, then we'll have to close the eyes.

54:30.976 --> 54:34.518
You have to put your left hand towards Me like this.

54:39.143 --> 54:42.892
I think most of them got Realization in the music only.

54:52.560 --> 54:55.851
And the right hand we have to use for giving

54:56.059 --> 54:59.351
energy to our centers on the left hand side.

55:07.851 --> 55:12.767
So we put our left hand towards Me, like this,

55:12.976 --> 55:16.976
symbolizing our desire to get Realization.

55:25.017 --> 55:27.892
So right hand we put it on our heart.

55:30.351 --> 55:33.684
In the heart resides the Spirit,

55:36.892 --> 55:39.143
which is the reflection

55:39.351 --> 55:42.641
of God Almighty, the Creator, in our heart.

55:47.143 --> 55:49.560
Then we take down our right hand

55:49.725 --> 55:52.934
in the upper part of our abdomen.

55:58.851 --> 56:02.601
This is the center of our mastery.

56:06.601 --> 56:12.351
All the prophets and great masters have built this for us.

56:18.641 --> 56:20.560
Then we take down our right hand

56:20.725 --> 56:23.767
in the lower portion of our abdomen,on the left hand side.

56:31.809 --> 56:35.725
This is the center of pure knowledge,

56:38.642 --> 56:40.934
the pure knowledge that manifest

56:41.143 --> 56:43.601
through our central nervous system,

56:48.851 --> 56:51.476
beyond mental projections.

56:55.143 --> 56:58.892
Then we take our right hand in the upper part of our abdomen,

56:59.226 --> 57:01.725
on the left hand side, again.

57:05.268 --> 57:07.851
Then, onto our heart.

57:10.393 --> 57:14.143
Then we take our right hand in the corner of our shoulder

57:14.351 --> 57:19.184
and our neck, and we turn our head to our right.

57:27.767 --> 57:31.641
I think you also do it, otherwise everybody is watching.

57:31.892 --> 57:36.226
Now, so this is the center will catch, when we feel guilty.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.518
Now, we take this hand

57:45.684 --> 57:49.642
on our forehead across it, like this, across

57:49.851 --> 57:53.143
and press it on both the sides.

57:57.725 --> 58:01.560
We bend our head as, while we are pressing.

58:07.309 --> 58:10.434
This is the center for forgiveness.

58:13.767 --> 58:16.560
Then we take our hand on the back side of our head,

58:16.725 --> 58:21.226
and slowly move our head upward like this, allow it to rest.

58:28.809 --> 58:30.684
This is the center

58:31.017 --> 58:34.809
where we have to ask for forgiveness, without feeling guilty.

58:43.309 --> 58:46.518
Now, we spread our hand, stretch it,

58:46.684 --> 58:49.268
and put the center of our palm

58:49.560 --> 58:53.101
on top of our fontanel-bone area,

58:53.309 --> 58:56.642
which was a soft bone in our childhood.

59:00.351 --> 59:05.351
We bend our head and push back our fingers

59:05.560 --> 59:08.851
and press our scalp, hard,

59:09.059 --> 59:13.476
and move it slowly, seven times, clockwise.

59:30.518 --> 59:32.892
That’s all we'll have to do.

59:33.101 --> 59:36.309
Only thing, remember, don’t put hand from this side, put this way,

59:36.476 --> 59:39.892
and stretch your fingers quite a lot

59:40.101 --> 59:43.101
to bring pressure.

59:52.268 --> 59:56.184
This way, put it this way, from the front.

59:56.725 --> 59:59.684
Now, we’ll close your eyes.

59:59.892 --> 01:00:02.393
You can take out your spectacles, if you like.

01:00:09.017 --> 01:00:12.226
And we don’t open our eyes, till I tell you.

01:00:16.143 --> 01:00:17.809
All right.

01:00:18.059 --> 01:00:22.226
So now, please, put your right hand on your heart.

01:00:25.684 --> 01:00:31.226
Left hand towards Me, both the feet away from each other and now...

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:42.393
Here you have to ask Me a very important question,

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:51.642
”Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:00:51.851 --> 01:00:54.017
Ask this questions three times.

01:01:04.684 --> 01:01:07.601
Now, if you are the Spirit,

01:01:07.809 --> 01:01:12.101
you are your master, you are your guide.

01:01:20.641 --> 01:01:23.268
So now, please, put your right hand

01:01:23.476 --> 01:01:26.601
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:35.393
And, please, ask another question -

01:01:35.641 --> 01:01:39.767
you can call Me, Shri Mataji or Mother, whichever suits you -

01:01:47.976 --> 01:01:51.934
so please, ask the question

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:57.434
“Mother, am I my own master?” Ask this question three times.

01:02:08.143 --> 01:02:10.725
I have already told you,

01:02:10.934 --> 01:02:14.560
that I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:02:14.725 --> 01:02:17.268
You have to know it in your own freedom,

01:02:17.476 --> 01:02:19.725
I respect your freedom.

01:02:33.809 --> 01:02:35.601
So please take your hand

01:02:35.767 --> 01:02:38.809
in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side

01:02:42.934 --> 01:02:45.767
and press it hard.

01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:49.809
Here,

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:56.393
please, say: “Mother, give me pure knowledge!”

01:02:56.601 --> 01:03:00.226
I cannot force on you. Say it six times, because

01:03:00.434 --> 01:03:04.393
this center has got six petals or six sub-plexuses.

01:03:24.892 --> 01:03:27.226
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:03:27.476 --> 01:03:30.101
your Kundalini starts moving upward,

01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:35.101
so we have to support the centers with our

01:03:35.642 --> 01:03:38.684
full confidence, in the higher regions.

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:52.725
So, please, raise your right hand

01:03:52.934 --> 01:03:56.641
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:04:01.934 --> 01:04:05.393
Here, with full confidence, you have to say,

01:04:08.601 --> 01:04:11.309
ten times, ”Mother,

01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:16.143
I am my own master!” Say it ten times, please.

01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:28.976
Say it ten times.

01:04:33.725 --> 01:04:38.268
Now, we have to know, that we are not this body,

01:04:39.059 --> 01:04:43.851
we are not this mind, we are not this intellect.

01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:56.641
We are not these emotions,

01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:02.434
nor we are our conditionings, nor our ego.

01:05:05.351 --> 01:05:08.434
We are pure Spirit.

01:05:11.393 --> 01:05:16.434
So, please, raise your right hand to your heart,

01:05:16.641 --> 01:05:21.017
and say it with full confidence, twelve times,

01:05:21.226 --> 01:05:24.641
”Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.518
I have already told you, that

01:06:02.851 --> 01:06:06.059
we should not feel guilty at all.

01:06:15.017 --> 01:06:17.101
We have to know,

01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:25.184
that Divine is the ocean of Love and Compassion.

01:06:31.851 --> 01:06:39.226
It is the ocean of joy and bliss.

01:06:43.434 --> 01:06:49.767
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:53.518 --> 01:06:56.351
So whatever mistakes we commit,

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:05.393
are dissolved into this great ocean of forgiveness.

01:07:09.434 --> 01:07:12.476
So, please, put your left hand

01:07:12.642 --> 01:07:17.560
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:07:17.725 --> 01:07:21.184
and turn your head to your right.

01:07:28.434 --> 01:07:30.518
Here...

01:07:31.226 --> 01:07:37.101
Here you have to say, with full confidence, sixteen times,

01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:39.601
sixteen times,

01:07:39.767 --> 01:07:44.601
”Mother, I am not guilty at all.”  Say it with full confidence.

01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:07.851
Now, as I have already told you,

01:08:09.434 --> 01:08:14.892
that whether we forgive or don't forgive, it is a myth.

01:08:22.434 --> 01:08:25.934
But if we don’t forgive, we play into wrong hands.

01:08:32.017 --> 01:08:35.143
And the Divinealso, says also,

01:08:35.351 --> 01:08:38.101
that " You better look after yourself".

01:08:43.059 --> 01:08:45.560
So, now, leave it to the Divine.

01:08:51.518 --> 01:08:54.642
Raise your right hand on your forehead

01:08:54.892 --> 01:08:59.309
and put the forehead, slowly bending down.

01:09:05.684 --> 01:09:08.725
Now, press it hard.

01:09:09.434 --> 01:09:14.101
Here, here you have to say,

01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:18.101
”Mother, I forgive everyone.” Please, do it. Because of this,

01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:21.851
I’ve seen many people, just don’t get Realization.

01:09:53.017 --> 01:09:56.934
Say it from your heart, not how many times.

01:10:01.059 --> 01:10:03.518
Now, take back your right hand

01:10:03.684 --> 01:10:06.226
on the back side of your head

01:10:06.434 --> 01:10:10.892
and put the head on it, slowly. Move it upward.

01:10:22.976 --> 01:10:26.476
Here now, you have to say without feeling guilty,

01:10:26.684 --> 01:10:30.809
without counting your mistakes, from your heart,

01:10:38.851 --> 01:10:43.101
“Oh, Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please, forgive me!”

01:10:51.017 --> 01:10:54.143
Now, say it from your heart.

01:11:00.601 --> 01:11:06.560
Stretch your hand, fully,

01:11:07.518 --> 01:11:10.017
and put the center of your palm

01:11:10.226 --> 01:11:13.809
on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:11:14.017 --> 01:11:17.560
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:11:23.725 --> 01:11:28.601
This is very important, because it is the actualization of baptism.

01:11:39.101 --> 01:11:45.767
Now, just push out your fingers

01:11:46.725 --> 01:11:51.518
and press your scalp hard,

01:11:51.809 --> 01:11:54.934
and move it seven times.

01:11:55.143 --> 01:12:00.017
But here, again, I cannot take your freedom.

01:12:00.351 --> 01:12:02.934
So, you have to say seven times,

01:12:03.226 --> 01:12:06.184
”Mother, please, give me my Realization!”

01:12:06.393 --> 01:12:10.434
I cannot force on you, I respect your freedom.

01:12:17.892 --> 01:12:20.309
Push back your fingers.

01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:38.976
It's quite in front, not on the back side, front side.

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:09.725
Now, please, take down your hand.

01:14:09.934 --> 01:14:12.101
Have there been, more [unclear], it's all right.

01:14:12.309 --> 01:14:16.143
Now, see for yourself. Open your eyes slowly.

01:14:18.059 --> 01:14:20.642
Open your eyes slowly.

01:14:26.476 --> 01:14:31.892
Now, put your right hand towards Me,

01:14:32.641 --> 01:14:36.017
and bend your head and see from the left hand,

01:14:36.226 --> 01:14:38.351
if you are feeling the cool breeze

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.268
coming out of your fontanel bone area, cool or hot.

01:15:00.143 --> 01:15:02.725
Now, please put your left hand

01:15:02.934 --> 01:15:06.518
and see with the right hand. Bend your head.

01:15:20.184 --> 01:15:24.226
Now, see with the right hand, again.

01:15:36.143 --> 01:15:39.268
Bend your head, bending down it's better.

01:15:46.393 --> 01:15:49.809
Now, raise your hands up like this

01:15:50.268 --> 01:15:55.059
and ask a question, three times,

01:15:55.309 --> 01:15:58.684
”Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:15:58.892 --> 01:16:03.934
Mother, is this the All-pervading power of God’s Love?

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:06.560
Mother, is this the Brahmachaitanya?”

01:16:06.725 --> 01:16:09.934
Ask one of this, three times.

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:32.601
Ask this, any of these questions, three times.

01:16:48.017 --> 01:16:52.393
All those, please, take down your hands.

01:16:55.309 --> 01:16:58.809
Now, watch Me without thinking. You can do it.

01:17:04.434 --> 01:17:07.476
Now, those who have felt the cool breeze

01:17:07.684 --> 01:17:13.101
out of their head, or in their hands, or even the heat,

01:17:13.434 --> 01:17:16.101
please, raise both your hands!

01:17:29.767 --> 01:17:35.143
Oh, My God! See the France. May God bless you all!

01:17:37.268 --> 01:17:40.351
So many of you!

01:17:40.601 --> 01:17:43.642
So be in silence now.

01:17:47.892 --> 01:17:50.393
Don’t argue.

01:17:52.476 --> 01:17:55.268
Tomorrow I’m coming again.

01:17:57.642 --> 01:18:00.809
If you all come early, then we can start the program

01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:03.351
at right time.

01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:14.725
And I would like to meet you all, personally, tomorrow.

01:18:18.976 --> 01:18:22.601
May God bless you all!

01:18:24.143 --> 01:18:26.725
So many of them have felt it.

01:18:31.309 --> 01:18:33.351
No one wants to leave.

01:18:43.226 --> 01:18:45.809
They are still here.

01:18:47.476 --> 01:18:49.934
They wait for Me to go....

01:18:52.268 --> 01:18:56.518
Some recording you can put, some musical record, anything.

01:18:58.226 --> 01:19:01.518
Any instrumental, so that…

01:19:15.268 --> 01:19:18.184
Tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be here.

01:19:19.725 --> 01:19:24.434
I’m saying just go and get if you can. Have some sort of a...

01:19:24.641 --> 01:19:28.059
Have you got some tape recordings? No tapes.

01:19:28.934 --> 01:19:32.226
Tapes? Have you got some musical tapes?

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:37.476
No? You didn't bring any tapes, with you? Music tapes.

01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:39.725
Then [who comes out?].

01:19:43.684 --> 01:19:45.767
Where are My shoes?

01:20:12.268 --> 01:20:16.351
Patrick, also tell them, those who did not get Realization,

01:20:16.601 --> 01:20:20.476
should not feel disappointed. Tomorrow all of them will get it.

01:20:51.268 --> 01:20:56.143
Tomorrow you should bring because they understand [unclear].
