00:05.620 --> 00:13.560
I must thank Warren for such a nice speech
that he has given and all the Australians

00:13.570 --> 00:19.910
the way they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. They
are all westernized in every sense of the

00:19.910 --> 00:30.970
word. There’s something about them where
I feel that they are very quick at knowing

00:30.970 --> 00:46.920
the truth. I don’t know how. They are not
that adamant against the truth. This opening

00:46.920 --> 00:57.829
somehow I found.
Seeking is everywhere very strong I feel America,

00:57.829 --> 01:05.449
England, Europe, everywhere the seeking is
very strong no doubt. There are seekers. Of

01:05.449 --> 01:12.890
course there is also a fashion of seeking
apart from that. There are real seekers, no

01:12.890 --> 01:24.400
doubt about it. And as he has said that ego
orientation is one of the characters in the

01:24.400 --> 01:33.090
West. That also one would say that it is more
now in the developing countries because they

01:33.090 --> 01:45.229
are supposed to be developed. But the way
these people have a special capacity to see

01:45.229 --> 01:53.430
the truth, see the truth is a very big thing.
Even if you are a developing country or a

01:53.430 --> 02:04.840
developed country, if you cannot perceive
the truth, you cannot assimilate it. That

02:04.840 --> 02:13.560
perception some how was surprising, I found
in Australia, was surprising.

02:13.560 --> 02:22.830
Now for example in England I worked very hard,
no doubt, years together. People are hard

02:22.830 --> 02:30.620
nuts, you can say. Once they are cracked they
are wonderful scholars. They know how to completely

02:30.620 --> 02:37.050
sort it out with their brains, everything
is there. But there are very few people who

02:37.050 --> 02:42.480
do that.
At the time of Christ you can see how many

02:42.480 --> 02:51.569
could recognize Him? Not even one, not even
one, believe Me. Except for John the Baptist,

02:51.569 --> 02:56.629
of course he was a realized soul. So, I mean
he should not be in the question. The rest

02:56.629 --> 03:03.550
of them were just sticking on to Him somehow,
as He said that you stick on to Me for some

03:03.550 --> 03:13.360
time. And till He got His resurrection, they
could not see the truth at all. To perceive

03:13.360 --> 03:23.250
it itself is a very big blessing I think.
And I do not know why people cannot perceive

03:23.250 --> 03:28.120
it because I cannot go to the other side and
see Myself what’s the problem is?

03:28.120 --> 03:37.739
For example in this country or in the West,
on the whole, the false people have come.

03:37.739 --> 03:45.959
They have minted money. They have palaces
and they have huge big aircrafts and they

03:45.959 --> 03:53.480
have material things and I mean immense wealth
they have collected out of the people who

03:53.480 --> 04:02.640
are supposed to be westernized. But Sahaja
Yoga, you’ll be amazed even to crack a journalist

04:02.640 --> 04:11.239
is a headache. A journalist doesn’t have
time for Me at all. It’s impossible to go

04:11.239 --> 04:20.059
and talk to any newspaper person, leave alone
any television or anything like that. Radio

04:20.059 --> 04:27.949
is an impossibility. Can you imagine, with
all these facilities God has given you, for

04:27.949 --> 04:34.860
spreading the message fast for the wider world?
But it is impossible you can’t talk to them,

04:34.860 --> 04:42.599
but let some, say a fake person coming, he’s
there. He’s on the televisions, he’s on

04:42.599 --> 04:50.710
the radio, Pope will come and see him. Your
Archbishop of Canterbury will go and touch

04:50.710 --> 04:57.719
his feet. And he is a fake, absolute fake.
Why?

04:57.719 --> 05:03.659
Only thing is that we are very money oriented.
They come out with their money. They provide

05:03.659 --> 05:10.889
lot of money for publication. They take money
and they use it. I mean if Christ was to be

05:10.889 --> 05:16.409
here I tell you He would have no place even
a mike would’ve been difficult for Him being

05:16.409 --> 05:23.819
a carpenter’s Son.
Sometimes I find it an impossible situation

05:23.819 --> 05:32.800
to tell them that after all how are you impressed
by these people who are taking such a lot

05:32.800 --> 05:46.419
of money out of you in the name of God? One
has to think about it that it is so money

05:46.419 --> 05:53.369
oriented that any man who comes with money
impresses people. Amazing in the country,

05:53.369 --> 05:59.800
which is so affluent, they are suffering from
affluence, that’s their disease. And there

05:59.800 --> 06:09.119
they are impressed by people who are using
money as a purpose of propaganda of God Almighty.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.119
Imagine the absurdity. I don’t know what
happens to their brains?

06:12.119 --> 06:23.789
This time I went to Edinburgh and people told
Me that most of the young people are disciples

06:23.789 --> 06:30.789
of a person who will not even be liked by
the servants of India, take it from Me. Even

06:30.789 --> 06:36.649
our servants will take money to go to him.
He doesn’t know good English, even up to

06:36.649 --> 06:43.749
that point you can say. He doesn’t know
anything, how to talk to people. He says he

06:43.749 --> 06:48.990
is fourteen year old which he is not. He’s
married an eight-year-old girl. I mean all

06:48.990 --> 06:55.189
kinds of things. He asked for Rolls Royces,
he has fifty-eight, he wanted a fifty ninth

06:55.189 --> 06:57.319
so they starved themselves and collected money
and gave him the 59th. You the English have

06:57.319 --> 07:08.669
done it, take it from Me.
Can you believe this stupidity? They have

07:08.669 --> 07:11.749
starved themselves and have done it. They
are seekers, seekers of what? Of giving Rolls

07:11.749 --> 07:22.619
Royce to this man? I mean I just can’t understand
how can it go to that stupid level? That’s

07:22.619 --> 07:29.759
what I feel that in Australia people have
not accepted anyone like that. They have not

07:29.759 --> 07:34.569
accepted. They are still you see, they did
this, they did that, He did everything – Warren,

07:34.569 --> 07:39.689
[Bah Kari?] this that. He did everything that
is possible under the Sun. They know all the

07:39.689 --> 07:46.289
gurus, all the gurus have gone to Australia
and they didn’t accept anyone. That’s

07:46.289 --> 07:52.209
the main point. All the time they are shaky
like this and as soon as they saw the truth

07:52.209 --> 08:00.999
they jumped on to it. We have to understand
that Spirit cannot be related to money by

08:00.999 --> 08:08.349
any chance. It has nothing to do.
Christ was a Son of a carpenter. Just think

08:08.349 --> 08:23.679
of that. He, the owner of all the properties
of the world, was born as a poor man. And

08:23.679 --> 08:34.349
how can you relate this to money? I just fail
to understand and this little truth Australians

08:34.349 --> 08:44.500
knew and I wish the English, the Americans
and the Europeans take out their attention

08:44.500 --> 08:52.079
from money and the comfort so called that
money gives you. I am sure, I am sure this

08:52.079 --> 08:56.569
country will rise. It has to rise. It has
to rise.

08:56.569 --> 09:03.019
Unless and until England rises, the world
cannot rise. This is a definite thing. Absolutely

09:03.019 --> 09:09.139
it is as definite as anything. England has
to rise first because it is the heart of the

09:09.139 --> 09:15.699
Universe. And the English Sahaja Yogis have
to also awaken to their responsibilities,

09:15.699 --> 09:25.050
which is very important. I will give all My
blood, all My energies, all that is possible

09:25.050 --> 09:34.050
under the sun to awaken this country to its
responsibility as a Spiritual nature, as the

09:34.050 --> 09:45.910
Spiritual being, as the Spiritual heart, as
the donor of blood, all over. And this is

09:45.910 --> 09:58.959
what saddens Me to see how people are drowning
themselves into some sort of a illusion and

09:58.959 --> 10:08.680
are not being able to see the truth.
Now as he has told you, that Sahaja Yoga is

10:08.680 --> 10:16.000
fantastic, no doubt about, it because you
are fantastic yourself. You are the Spirit;

10:16.000 --> 10:22.620
you are The Spirit. You have to just become
the Spirit is the point. Once you become the

10:22.620 --> 10:30.500
Spirit you are dynamic; not dynamic but you
are the master of everything. You can control

10:30.500 --> 10:39.860
things, you can enjoy everything, you become
blissful. You can do such a lot because you

10:39.860 --> 10:47.250
are the Spirit and you have become the Spirit.
It is as simple as that. God Almighty has

10:47.250 --> 10:55.379
placed this Power within us at the triangular
bone, it exits there.

10:55.379 --> 11:02.629
It has to just rise and give you a real baptism
by which you feel your Spirit first time where

11:02.629 --> 11:10.639
it flows like cool breeze in the hand. As
simple as that.

11:10.639 --> 11:16.930
Now this happening is a very very strong happening.
For some people it’s a very strong happening

11:16.930 --> 11:24.220
– first day, because you are seekers. You
are seekers. Believe Me you are seekers of

11:24.220 --> 11:34.639
thousands of years. Born in this country to
get what you have been seeking. But what do

11:34.639 --> 11:39.810
we expect?
I wish he had not mentioned you the word puja

11:39.810 --> 11:45.379
because it can again give you the thing that
it is sort of a some one-person business.

11:45.379 --> 11:53.629
It’s not that. Warren says puja because
all these centers have got Deities. Especially

11:53.629 --> 12:05.319
this center is the center of Christ. You have
to make these Deities within you happy and

12:05.319 --> 12:11.629
awaken them. And that awakening must take
place; you must understand where these Deities

12:11.629 --> 12:15.829
exist. And these deities are nothing but are
incarnations of God’s aspect like you can

12:15.829 --> 12:24.769
say Christ incarnated, who is placed at this
point where the optic chasma is between the

12:24.769 --> 12:35.870
pituitary and pineal body. And when Christ
is awakened, when He gets into action within

12:35.870 --> 12:46.170
you, then your two things that are shown there
– the blue and the yellow, the blue is the

12:46.170 --> 12:56.050
superego and yellow is the ego, are sucked
in. Means all your karmas, all your doings,

12:56.050 --> 13:03.449
your ego and superego are sucked in.
That means He has crucified Himself in such

13:03.449 --> 13:13.389
a way that He has made within us a passage.
When He is awakened, He sucks that and all

13:13.389 --> 13:18.279
our sins. Sins is nothing but conditionings
you can say and other things that we have

13:18.279 --> 13:26.180
got within us. Everything is sucked in. When
it is sucked in, then only the Kundalini can

13:26.180 --> 13:35.089
rise above that.
Now Sahaja Yogis know that Christ is one of

13:35.089 --> 13:44.920
the aspects – is the Son aspect. And there
are aspects where He is a creator, where He

13:44.920 --> 14:00.499
is a sustainer, where He is a Master you can
say and where He is the witness. All these

14:00.499 --> 14:06.079
things, people never gave chance to Him to
speak. Now I’ve been speaking for seven

14:06.079 --> 14:14.519
years in this country. But for four years
I could’ve hardly spoken even twice or thrice

14:14.519 --> 14:21.499
because I was struggling with six of them.
So we can imagine you gave Him only three

14:21.499 --> 14:27.740
years or say at the most four years to speak
about these things and how many things He

14:27.740 --> 14:34.050
has spoken and how many these people who were
supposed to be his disciples have written

14:34.050 --> 14:42.120
down, God alone knows. And whatever they have
communicated is so limited that it has created

14:42.120 --> 14:51.259
problems for you. But every sentence, every
word that He has spoken is so deep and you

14:51.259 --> 14:58.870
can only understand it when you get your Realization.
When there is no light what’s the use of

14:58.870 --> 15:03.399
telling you there are these pictures; there
are flowers there and this picture there and

15:03.399 --> 15:10.800
this is the color of the paper that is put
on these walls, what’s the use? There is

15:10.800 --> 15:17.720
no light to see. When you get the light I
don’t have to tell you as He said, “The

15:17.720 --> 15:24.809
knowledge start [tickling?] within, automatically.”
You are that Spirit and unless and until that

15:24.809 --> 15:31.470
Spirit is manifested what else are you seeking?
A guru says, “I do this thing, I do that

15:31.470 --> 15:39.490
thing.” All right so what? What about us?
What do we have got it from this temple? What

15:39.490 --> 15:47.709
has he given us? You must find out. His disciples
are there. For example they went to the Ganeshpuri

15:47.709 --> 15:51.629
this thing and there everybody was jumping.
‘Ha, ha, ha, hu, hu’, taking out clothes

15:51.629 --> 15:56.089
and I don’t know and then taking all kinds
of drugs and this and that.

15:56.089 --> 16:06.100
For jumping you don’t pay. You can jump
without paying. And drugs also they had to

16:06.100 --> 16:13.519
pay. Even without payment he could not produce
any drugs. So one should understand that this

16:13.519 --> 16:24.470
kind of a nonsense and down foolery is mockery
of yourself. Is just mockery. You are that

16:24.470 --> 16:31.999
dignified, magnificent thing, which is the
Spirit. And you are befooled by these people.

16:31.999 --> 16:45.490
You should see, this much at least, that anyone
who has given any powers to another person

16:45.490 --> 16:50.999
should be accepted, isn’t it?
I mean supposing somebody says that a particular

16:50.999 --> 16:56.279
thing is very good. Say – ‘this kind of
a lamp is very good.’ Then you see at least

16:56.279 --> 17:03.350
how it works? If the one who says, “You
see the lamp”. You must at least see the

17:03.350 --> 17:13.299
disciples of these gurus and then decide.
This is very much lacking. Like sheep they

17:13.299 --> 17:21.779
follow and they fall into horrible ditches.
Doesn’t matter as far as God is concerned

17:21.779 --> 17:28.390
He’s bent upon saving His creation. He’s
bent upon it. He will do it whatever you may

17:28.390 --> 17:33.700
try to destroy. You try your level best to
destroy yourself and destroy the world that

17:33.700 --> 17:42.110
He has created. But He is all-powerful. He
is all forgiving. He is all compassion. He

17:42.110 --> 17:49.539
is going to save you whatever you may try.
Try your level best. But for a change why

17:49.539 --> 17:56.419
not try to save yourself and save others?
This is what one has to seek.

17:56.419 --> 18:04.779
Now when listening to Me also you should doubt
because you are in free condition. You are

18:04.779 --> 18:12.710
not mesmerized by Me. If I was a real mesmerizer,
you could not have asked Me any questions.

18:12.710 --> 18:17.070
You all would’ve fallen straight at My feet.
There would have been no questioning at all

18:17.070 --> 18:23.140
because there are thousands who are doing
that stupidly. But you are free, you are free

18:23.140 --> 18:29.140
to doubt, no doubt. But doubting what? One
has to think, “What are we doubting?”

18:29.140 --> 18:38.200
As he said, “I am the most expensive person.”
[IT MAKES ME LAUGH?] Because you cannot pay

18:38.200 --> 18:45.490
for it. It’s so expensive that all your
banks drained out cannot pay for it. All your

18:45.490 --> 18:50.760
wealth that you have here so called wealth
that you have accumulated cannot purchase

18:50.760 --> 19:00.140
it. It’s so expensive. It is invaluable.
Is the richest thing in the world that cannot

19:00.140 --> 19:08.450
be purchased by any riches. It is, no doubt
but is not exclusive. It’s meant for everyone.

19:08.450 --> 19:14.350
The doors are open now for everyone.
Now don’t you worry. Don’t count your

19:14.350 --> 19:23.179
sins and your guilts and this and that, forget
that. It’s the grace that itself is anxious

19:23.179 --> 19:30.390
as I told you and you all ought to get your
realization and should grow into it. You will

19:30.390 --> 19:36.580
enjoy the complete bliss of your being which
is so beautiful. Like a diamond it is sparkling.

19:36.580 --> 19:45.669
Only thing, you have to just unveil it. And
that is not difficult for you, not at all

19:45.669 --> 19:50.149
difficult.
Now the things that he has told about the

19:50.149 --> 19:56.960
physical side, that’s the minimum that should
happen. That’s the minimum of minimum that

19:56.960 --> 20:05.559
should happen to anyone who comes to Sahaja
Yoga. Because if you are the temple of God

20:05.559 --> 20:14.870
then it has to be cleansed before God is established
within you, before the Deity is sparkled in

20:14.870 --> 20:19.299
you, it has to be cleansed. So the cleansing
takes place automatically; don’t have to

20:19.299 --> 20:24.679
worry about that, that’s automatic. Even
a thing like cancer can be cured in no time.

20:24.679 --> 20:29.120
A cancer can only be cured by Sahaja Yoga,
by nothing else take it from Me. It cannot

20:29.120 --> 20:36.019
be cured. It may be that you may loose your
throat, sometimes nose, sometimes ears and

20:36.019 --> 20:43.350
you may continue with the doctors but with
cancer you live in one body and get cured.

20:43.350 --> 20:49.820
And there are some cancer patients here, sitting
down. They perhaps do not know and some of

20:49.820 --> 20:57.120
them know also; have been completely cured
by Sahajayoga. The reason is that your body

20:57.120 --> 21:03.480
is just ready, is waiting for that moment
when you get the light. As soon as you get

21:03.480 --> 21:07.539
the light immediately you know where is the
problem and you start correcting it. Once

21:07.539 --> 21:14.440
you start correcting it, it’s not you. But
this Power corrects it. Imagine this light

21:14.440 --> 21:21.769
not only enlightens the room but also corrects
it. Think of such a thing that is God’s

21:21.769 --> 21:30.190
love. That it loves you, it coordinates everything,
it makes you cooperate and it blesses you

21:30.190 --> 21:35.440
with the highest.
This all pervading power has been described

21:35.440 --> 21:40.210
in the scriptures. Everybody said, “There
is all pervading power.” Now you might say,

21:40.210 --> 21:46.610
“Where is it? We can’t see. How are we
to believe?” Now as I always give an example

21:46.610 --> 21:52.600
of a television, which I saw first time when
it came to India. That in a village people

21:52.600 --> 21:57.510
were told that there is an ether around us
and you can, there are lots of dramas and

21:57.510 --> 22:04.289
music and plays going on. They said, “How
can we believe it?” So they just put the

22:04.289 --> 22:09.539
television to the mains and it started working
fantastically. And they were amazed, they

22:09.539 --> 22:15.299
had to believe that is coming, there’s no
other connection, is coming, through this.

22:15.299 --> 22:23.480
That’s what it is. You are an instrument.
Exquisitely made, beautifully, delicately

22:23.480 --> 22:29.899
constructed. Just for this happening. Of course
you’ve ruined it. So many have ruined it

22:29.899 --> 22:35.500
no doubt; you have tried in your childishness.
Doesn’t matter; makes no difference. You

22:35.500 --> 22:41.210
will get your realization. You should have
no worry on that point. That’s My worry.

22:41.210 --> 22:46.260
Once you get your realization then you can
give realizations to others.

22:46.260 --> 22:52.460
Now about the lady that he told who got well
and was very sick. I must tell you that first

22:52.460 --> 23:01.120
of all she was very very sick and she was
about to die. I was not there at that time.

23:01.120 --> 23:08.159
Actually these people were there. Warren didn’t
want to say out of humility I think.

23:08.159 --> 23:16.190
These people went there and put My photograph
there and gave her vibrations. And she came

23:16.190 --> 23:22.610
to consciousness and they were surprised.
The one, who was going to die, has been declared

23:22.610 --> 23:29.850
– going to die very soon, came to consciousness.
And they then thought there’s something

23:29.850 --> 23:38.720
great about it. Then they came away. Still
the doctors couldn’t believe it. And the

23:38.720 --> 23:44.159
relations also said, “How can that be? What
is it?” She again went into coma, when I

23:44.159 --> 23:49.610
was there.
But a gentleman, who was related to her, was

23:49.610 --> 23:56.610
connected with newspapers. Some how it worked
out and he published a lot that we have proof

23:56.610 --> 24:01.610
to believe that Sahaja Yoga can cure people.
And that’s how it started and that’s how

24:01.610 --> 24:09.950
worked out. But the first thing was done by
Warren and company, not by Mother.

24:09.950 --> 24:18.380
So they themselves had the powers to cure,
to give realization, to do all that I can

24:18.380 --> 24:24.809
do. And that’s what it is that once you
are enlightened you should manifest your own

24:24.809 --> 24:31.320
powers. Otherwise the rest of the thing is
nothing but a joke. You jump or you stand

24:31.320 --> 24:36.399
on your heads. That you can always do what
is so great about it? If it is some God’s

24:36.399 --> 24:43.019
grace has to come upon you then you must manifest
something special. Not only curing but raising

24:43.019 --> 24:49.149
of the Kundalini.
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum,

24:49.149 --> 24:54.340
meaning sacred bone that means these people,
who have given the name to it long time back,

24:54.340 --> 25:01.120
must have known that this is a sacred bone.
Otherwise why did they call it sacrum? But

25:01.120 --> 25:07.350
I think that knowledge was lost in Latin,
in Norway must have been, the knowledge was

25:07.350 --> 25:12.220
lost and that’s how they do not know, they
just call it the sacrum. Now you can see with

25:12.220 --> 25:18.960
your naked eyes, the pulsation of the Kundalini
and rising. You can feel the pulsation on

25:18.960 --> 25:25.210
your head when it comes there and afterwards
you find complete it has become quiet. As

25:25.210 --> 25:30.059
soon as becomes quiet you start feeling in
the hands. Of course this center should be

25:30.059 --> 25:33.809
all right. If this center is not all right
you don’t feel in the hands but you feel

25:33.809 --> 25:41.159
on the head. This center is to be corrected
then, then you can feel in your hands.

25:41.159 --> 25:47.679
Now this you can do yourself when you are
realized. Its not only Me, you can do it also.

25:47.679 --> 25:55.200
I mean in, say in Australia say, we can say
if there are two thousand people who have

25:55.200 --> 26:04.980
got Realization, I could’ve given only to
about five hundred, the rest are done by these

26:04.980 --> 26:08.230
people only.
You people can give Realization. But difference

26:08.230 --> 26:15.480
in Australia and here is – now if an English
Sahaja Yogi tries to talk to someone about

26:15.480 --> 26:21.659
Sahaja Yoga, the person says, “You are not
supposed to discuss religion”. I mean that’s

26:21.659 --> 26:26.649
an etiquette, it is supposed to be. You can’t
discuss religion. This you can’t discuss

26:26.649 --> 26:34.250
God. So they run away. Hard to get even two
people in, to talk about Sahaja Yoga. This

26:34.250 --> 26:38.450
is the problem otherwise all of them are capable
of giving realization.

26:38.450 --> 26:48.610
Now Douglas is sitting here. Talk to David
Frawl. I knew that he was doing TM and he

26:48.610 --> 26:56.190
told him also. And here talking to him, David
Frawl feeling heated up, absolutely boiling.

26:56.190 --> 27:03.149
And he was perspiring, is a fact. And when
he came to the thing, now he’s got Realization.

27:03.149 --> 27:09.889
He is giving Realization to people when he
got cured. I mean you don’t need much brains

27:09.889 --> 27:20.080
for that. You don’t need any accessories
of the world, which are regarded as very practical.

27:20.080 --> 27:26.690
I would say that Douglas at that time was
one of the most impractical person. He had

27:26.690 --> 27:32.580
taken drugs and he had taken all these things;
there are many who were like this. Some were,

27:32.580 --> 27:37.340
some had come from lunatic asylum and they
started giving realization.

27:37.340 --> 27:42.440
The other day in Norridge there were three
persons sitting in front row and were all

27:42.440 --> 27:46.220
shaking up before Me. I said, “Now from
where these have come?” I asked them, “From

27:46.220 --> 27:51.419
where they have come.” They said, “We
have come from lunatic asylum and we are certified

27:51.419 --> 27:57.330
mad people.” I said, “You are certified
and you are here. How are you here? I mean

27:57.330 --> 28:01.710
if you are certified mad you are not supposed
to be here”. They said, “One person came

28:01.710 --> 28:07.970
to My program and got well. So the authorities
have sent us here for getting well, so we

28:07.970 --> 28:14.659
are here.” And I won’t be surprised that
these three may start a Sahaja Yoga center

28:14.659 --> 28:21.419
in Norridge, very soon. But I said, “You
better return the certificates to them”.

28:21.419 --> 28:28.600
It is such a great thing you can imagine certified
mad people getting Realization and starting

28:28.600 --> 28:32.720
a Sahaja Yoga center.
There are people who were cancer patients,

28:32.720 --> 28:39.639
who got realization and have started a Sahaja
Yoga center. So you can imagine how tremendous

28:39.639 --> 28:47.940
are the Powers of God and how carefully He
has made us to be that Spirit. We have no

28:47.940 --> 28:55.919
idea; we have no esteem of ourselves. We do
not know what great thing we are and what

28:55.919 --> 29:01.700
we have to achieve and what we have to enjoy.
Actually He is such a gracious Father, He’s

29:01.700 --> 29:09.230
so generous and He’s so loving that He wants
to share His joy. He wants you to enter into

29:09.230 --> 29:18.450
the kingdom of God. And to enjoy that bliss,
that happiness, that freedom which has been

29:18.450 --> 29:24.720
promised to you in all the scriptures. It’s
as simple as that. It is so simple that I

29:24.720 --> 29:30.710
don’t know how I’ve given four hundred
lectures about such a simple thing like Self

29:30.710 --> 29:35.120
-Realization. And they say they are all wonderful
and one is better than the other.

29:35.120 --> 29:39.380
But today’s lecture must be, has been a
more of an introduction because according

29:39.380 --> 29:46.509
to them there are many new people today. Whatever
it is I would like to allow you to ask Me

29:46.509 --> 29:52.899
some questions. And everybody should admit
that new people should ask questions and Sahaja

29:52.899 --> 29:58.049
Yogis should not feel upset about it. Because
sometimes you know questions can be very aggressive

29:58.049 --> 30:02.600
and they get upset. But there should be nothing
to worry about it. Its all right your Mother

30:02.600 --> 30:07.389
knows how to handle everything. So nothing
to be upset about it because they have already

30:07.389 --> 30:13.889
passed [ ? ] saying that no questions will
be allowed to ask to Mother. See if I am a

30:13.889 --> 30:19.950
Mother, if I have patience, if I have love
then you should not worry. You should not

30:19.950 --> 30:25.639
worry about it at all. I have to manage all
of them. Sometimes in the beginning everybody

30:25.639 --> 30:28.769
is like that.
Just now Warren has told you how he was because

30:28.769 --> 30:32.990
he was made to sleep on the cement. I mean
he was not made but he slipped out you see.

30:32.990 --> 30:39.669
And next day he was down with very great agitation,
he was going back to Australia. But I caught

30:39.669 --> 30:45.220
hold of his shirt, I said, “Can you wait
for sometime lets see it might work out?”

30:45.220 --> 30:50.789
So it is like that. It’s a very sweet thing
you know and I know that children have a right

30:50.789 --> 30:55.580
to get angry with Mother but not too much
of it. Because after all you are here for

30:55.580 --> 31:00.960
a purpose and that purpose must be fulfilled.
That’s why I am here.

31:00.960 --> 31:07.700
May God bless you all.
I would like to have really some questions

31:07.700 --> 31:12.549
because sometimes these questions also help
a lot for Me to understand what’s the problem

31:12.549 --> 31:28.370
is. Can I have some questions please? Yes
please.

31:28.370 --> 31:37.940
Question: [Not Audible]
Yes, Yes. What Warren has told you is a caution

31:37.940 --> 31:45.850
but I have, I know so many people who have
got Rrealization without any return. [NOT

31:45.850 --> 31:53.100
AUDIBLE] I know so many people [NOT AUDIBLE].
Warren has given you a thing of caution because

31:53.100 --> 32:00.809
he has seen some people that they drop out
because the Kundalini comes down and they

32:00.809 --> 32:06.690
find little frustrating. But I have all the
patience and you should have patience but

32:06.690 --> 32:14.960
I haven’t met anybody who has been with
us, doesn’t feel it. You may not feel the

32:14.960 --> 32:20.809
vibrations but there are, Realization is there.
Because when you put your hand on your head

32:20.809 --> 32:25.960
you definitely get the cool breeze coming
out and you give Realizations to others, that’s

32:25.960 --> 32:30.049
the proof of it.
There’s someone who was always caught up

32:30.049 --> 32:33.730
on all the fingers, he feels the tingling
all the time. But he gives Realization to

32:33.730 --> 32:36.820
so many people. He has given himself, he’s
caught up.

32:36.820 --> 32:42.620
Its something like this, you can say even
if it’s the fifth hand car it moves, once

32:42.620 --> 32:49.080
started. You go on repairing it, but it moves,
no doubt it moves. So nothing to be upset

32:49.080 --> 32:51.179
about it.
[NOT AUDIBLE]

32:51.179 --> 33:09.230
When do we? Right now? Me-Me? I don’t know
how many thousand years. I was born with it.

33:09.230 --> 33:18.710
Yes very much, very much, very much, very
much realized. I was born as a real great

33:18.710 --> 33:33.919
great Grand Mother, I tell you. I knew everything
about [IT or HER] from My very childhood.

33:33.919 --> 33:41.080
I was very conscious, over alert.
[NOT AUDIBLE]

33:41.080 --> 33:49.120
Repeat! [NOT AUDIBLE]
Rare thing beware, beware yes beware, beware,

33:49.120 --> 33:58.500
beware, yes true. Yes, it’s correct, correct
that’s true. [NOT AUDIBLE] Yes I must tell

33:58.500 --> 34:05.840
you about that. You see the people who have
written about Kundalini. I started knowing

34:05.840 --> 34:09.889
about them that there are people who have
written about Kundalini. And I was amazed

34:09.889 --> 34:14.710
because they are absolutely ignorant, not
only ignorant but stupid people. I don’t

34:14.710 --> 34:19.360
know from where did they get this knowledge
because people do not know about this, they

34:19.360 --> 34:22.780
started printing it. Perhaps anything you
can print and isn’t it?

34:22.780 --> 34:27.670
I’ve seen such a big book where the fellow
doesn’t know where the Kundalini is; he

34:27.670 --> 34:33.080
says it is in the stomach. Then he says it
is in the back, he doesn’t know anything.

34:33.080 --> 34:42.220
Now the trouble is this knowledge was a very
secret knowledge, thousands of years back

34:42.220 --> 34:49.090
and it started descending – this knowledge
to people very slowly like on a tree there’s

34:49.090 --> 34:54.640
only one flower or two flowers maybe.
Now in the sixth century, actually Christ

34:54.640 --> 35:00.900
talked about it quite a lot. And other people
like Moses and all these people have talked

35:00.900 --> 35:06.110
about it. But the ones, who wrote, never got
anything. [THEY HAVE?] Perhaps so they wrote

35:06.110 --> 35:10.640
it in a very mystical way like, ‘I’ll
appear before you like tongues of flames or

35:10.640 --> 35:20.270
the tree of fire’ and all that – indicative
of all that. But it so happened that in the

35:20.270 --> 35:26.600
sixth century somebody in India called as
Adi Shankaracharya – He was actually Buddha

35:26.600 --> 35:32.710
reborn, He started talking about it. Self-realization,
of course Buddha talked about it. Then He

35:32.710 --> 35:36.560
started telling about these, all these nadis
and everything He described.

35:36.560 --> 35:43.680
But there is a poet in India whose name is
Markdandeya who has written about this. They

35:43.680 --> 35:53.190
say he was living in India about say ten thousand
years back – this poet, about that time.

35:53.190 --> 35:59.000
So this knowledge was known to people but
was not put down on the paper, was not circulated,

35:59.000 --> 36:04.440
was not for en masse.
Now these people who are writing about it

36:04.440 --> 36:10.330
have no knowledge, have no authority and they
have tried these tricks. Actually this is

36:10.330 --> 36:18.720
the holiest of holy – the sanctum sanctorum
within you. And a person who himself is authorized

36:18.720 --> 36:25.260
by God can only do it. Authorized by God not
by any say theological college or all these

36:25.260 --> 36:32.360
things. It cannot. God should authorize – like
Christ, like you can say John the Baptist,

36:32.360 --> 36:36.940
like Moses, like that somebody authorized
by God can only do it.

36:36.940 --> 36:42.510
So these people tried the tricks, which are
unauthorized, and they got results because

36:42.510 --> 36:52.580
there’s a deity sitting in the last chakra
called as Mooladhara chakra, which is the

36:52.580 --> 37:04.540
root – support of the root. That chakra,
He tries to excite your sympathetic by that

37:04.540 --> 37:08.760
and when the sympathetic is excited you get
all these heats and this and that and the

37:08.760 --> 37:13.850
boils and all. So it is not meant for people
who have no holiness in them. You have to

37:13.850 --> 37:18.490
be a holy person, who should be able to raise
the Kundalini, you should be cleansed otherwise

37:18.490 --> 37:22.770
you cannot do this work.
While there are people who are connecting

37:22.770 --> 37:29.360
Kundalini, imagine, with sex. I mean it’s
an absurd thing; She’s your Mother. She

37:29.360 --> 37:35.290
is your Mother and has been your Mother all
these ages and it’s like having a dirty

37:35.290 --> 37:40.320
feeling for your Mother I would say that.
It’s such a filth. So God should punish

37:40.320 --> 37:47.190
them [INAUDIBLE]. That’s how they have it
as a punishment. It’s not at all to be afraid

37:47.190 --> 37:52.140
of your own Mother. Will you be? I mean that’s
one thing you are not afraid of, is your own

37:52.140 --> 38:00.490
Mother. Should not be. I mean modern mothers
I don’t know. But that’s what it is. It

38:00.490 --> 38:03.980
is they have no knowledge.
Now I must tell you that Sahaja Yoga must

38:03.980 --> 38:09.400
have given realization I don’t know how
many thousands, tens of thousands of people.

38:09.400 --> 38:15.110
Of course you may feel little heated up or
if you are possessed, you might feel little

38:15.110 --> 38:20.640
bit shaken up. People who have been to TM,
one of them jumped about 20 ft., when they

38:20.640 --> 38:25.370
heard My name. All these things may happen
to few people. But I mean such extreme cases

38:25.370 --> 38:29.570
are very rare, that’s all. But nothing goes
wrong. I mean you are ultimately cured of

38:29.570 --> 38:36.540
that. So you might get little effects of that.
But nothing serious. I am here to look after.

38:36.540 --> 38:41.460
On the contrary it’s very blissful, very
blissful.

38:41.460 --> 38:49.090
If one does not know about something, they
should not get into it, isn’t it?

38:49.090 --> 38:52.480
Any other question?
[INAUDIBLE]

38:52.480 --> 38:57.640
But you must get it, that’s the main point.
You see, this if you don’t get, you will

38:57.640 --> 39:01.640
never be happy person. You have to get it
and it is your right. It is within you why

39:01.640 --> 39:06.610
not get it? It just doesn’t cost you anything.
You have to have it. But people refuse to

39:06.610 --> 39:12.460
have this, imagine refuse to be the Spirit.
Can you imagine?

39:12.460 --> 39:18.290
They are satisfied. The other day I met a
lady who came and she said, “I am quite

39:18.290 --> 39:24.660
satisfied with the simple life I lead, Mother”.
I said, “Now what am I to do? If you are

39:24.660 --> 39:27.960
satisfied My child, I would only say that
a day will come and you’ll come back to

39:27.960 --> 39:34.040
Me, but I may not be here”. You see all
these things recoil upon. What question of

39:34.040 --> 39:40.200
sinfulness? Even a sort of a casual way towards
your Spirit, if you are casually interested

39:40.200 --> 39:45.640
in your Spirit it tells upon you, because
Spirit resides in your heart and it recedes,

39:45.640 --> 39:50.510
you have problems. And you all get into problems
with that. When they get into problems – I

39:50.510 --> 39:55.700
mean a lady who came to Me, she said, “I
am not interested, this that.” And she said,

39:55.700 --> 40:00.700
“I don’t want to do it.” But ultimately
she got cancer. When she came to Me and she

40:00.700 --> 40:08.110
had a galloping cancer. We tried to help her,
we couldn’t help much, she died. It happens

40:08.110 --> 40:12.840
with some people that they come at a stage
where we cannot help them at all.

40:12.840 --> 40:19.890
So best thing is to get your own powers of
your Spirit and be all right, enjoy yourself.

40:19.890 --> 40:24.920
You don’t have to pay bills of doctors.
You don’t have to worry about so many things.

40:24.920 --> 40:31.830
And automatically the whole thing works out.
And also the petrol bill, as he said.

40:31.830 --> 40:38.780
Krishna has said, “Yogakshema Vahamyaham”.
Means when you have the union – Yoga, when

40:38.780 --> 40:45.100
you become united, with that Divine Power,
the well being is looked after. I mean all

40:45.100 --> 40:51.790
the Sahaja Yogis who are here, have benefited
even monetarily, because within us lies also

40:51.790 --> 40:57.600
the power, which gives us money. Which gives
us well being. There is a center within us,

40:57.600 --> 41:01.510
which does that. And if that center is caught
up then people have problems with money. Once

41:01.510 --> 41:16.370
it is cured, you don’t have. Not money as
such but material life, improves definitely.

41:16.370 --> 41:26.380
[INAUDIBLE]
Chakras are the essences, you see, which create

41:26.380 --> 41:33.900
our plexuses. And the plexuses are expressing
the nerves. So the chakras in any case are

41:33.900 --> 41:40.440
the predecessors of the nerves, of the nervous
system. They are the predecessor. They are

41:40.440 --> 41:51.770
the ones who supply the energy to the nerves.
They are the ones who guide the nerves – Chakras.

41:51.770 --> 42:00.960
[INAUDIBLE]
Astral body – our body is made of various,

42:00.960 --> 42:09.550
various cocoons we can say. These chakras
are say we are material being or physical

42:09.550 --> 42:20.030
being, we are emotional being, we are mental
being, we are spiritual being and all these

42:20.030 --> 42:30.740
are like our body. Now the astral being that
you know is actually the soul, we can say,

42:30.740 --> 42:43.150
which is this whole body without the element
of Earth and Water, that’s the astral body.

42:43.150 --> 42:49.520
Now this astral body you should not worry
much because that we get in any case when

42:49.520 --> 42:56.270
we die. That you are going to get it. But
when we have the body then only we can get

42:56.270 --> 43:00.130
our realization, not in the astral sense.
But people are trying lots of tricks with

43:00.130 --> 43:05.950
these astral bodies, which is a very very
dangerous thing, and it has reached such dangerous

43:05.950 --> 43:12.850
limits, because people have interest in this,
that I am really shocked the way it is working

43:12.850 --> 43:18.730
out.
For example: there was a couple in Switzerland

43:18.730 --> 43:28.040
and they had a relation – their mother in
America. And that lady was trying with one

43:28.040 --> 43:35.310
of these astral body persons, those who work
on Spirits and she said that I would like

43:35.310 --> 43:43.450
to talk to my grandson. And the grandson is
a living child and the child is in Switzerland.

43:43.450 --> 43:49.690
It sounds very fantastic to people. That is
something great you see, the child is in there

43:49.690 --> 43:55.700
without paying any airfare you can talk to
your child – grand child. It’s very dangerous.

43:55.700 --> 44:00.780
And they used to try that on the child and
the child when it would sleep in the night,

44:00.780 --> 44:08.090
it would be daytime in America. And she would
talk to him through this and she would hear

44:08.090 --> 44:12.930
the voice of the child. They recorded all
that. One day this child was sleeping and

44:12.930 --> 44:20.140
he never got up, he died. And the recording
said that it is too much strain for me, now

44:20.140 --> 44:26.350
let me go grandma, let me go, let me go. She
said, “No, no, wait for a while, wait for

44:26.350 --> 44:31.020
a while” and this spirit controlling woman
would not allow the Spirit to go back and

44:31.020 --> 44:38.710
the child died, is a very common happening
now that the children suddenly die in their

44:38.710 --> 44:43.130
beds.
So all these tricks we should not try. Whatever

44:43.130 --> 44:48.980
is unknown is not Divine. You have the left
side and the right side. This is called as

44:48.980 --> 44:53.910
the Adibhautik and it’s the Adidaivik, means
the collective subconscious and collective

44:53.910 --> 45:00.320
supraconscious. There are all these dead Spirits.
Don’t play with them. Don’t get into this

45:00.320 --> 45:06.470
nonsense of astral body and this and that.
There are some people who say that we want

45:06.470 --> 45:13.230
to separate from our body and fly in the air.
Why, why do you want to do that? You want

45:13.230 --> 45:17.890
to have your spirit or not? If you want to
have these experiences, I am not for that.

45:17.890 --> 45:24.430
And I will ban it, if you ask Me. It’s absolutely
horrible. Of course people take money for

45:24.430 --> 45:29.260
it and people like it to talk to spirits and
this and that but is very dangerous. You should

45:29.260 --> 45:36.010
never try this with the spirits. Is a very
dangerous line when you do not know about

45:36.010 --> 45:41.710
it, one should not get to it.
I have known people who have practiced these

45:41.710 --> 45:48.200
things; their great grand children are suffering,
seven generations they suffer – seven generations.

45:48.200 --> 45:53.080
Those even practice it. So it’s a very dangerous
game, one should never play it. What is the

45:53.080 --> 46:02.190
need? You should live in the present not in
the future or not in the past. It’s the

46:02.190 --> 46:07.870
present you have to achieve. So you just don’t
worry about these things. You become your

46:07.870 --> 46:14.060
Spirit. You have to be born again and that
should happen to you, which should be an actualization

46:14.060 --> 46:22.210
that should actually happen.
And what these Gurus are doing, are nothing

46:22.210 --> 46:28.550
but putting the Spirits in you and are mesmerizing.
That’s how you behave like this. You are

46:28.550 --> 46:37.820
no more yourself, you are something else.
This is the trick of the trade. They are all

46:37.820 --> 46:46.640
using you for their own purposes by just mesmerizing
and mesmerism is manifested by using the Spirits,

46:46.640 --> 46:52.830
which they are controlling. Especially for
Christians it is forbidden. I don’t know;

46:52.830 --> 47:03.030
I don’t know how they don’t understand.
So lets have the experience now. It’s just

47:03.030 --> 47:10.780
a split of a second needed for that, split
of a second. It depends on, if he, if the

47:10.780 --> 47:17.110
landings are very good you won’t feel anything
else but the cool breeze suddenly but if it

47:17.110 --> 47:24.970
is not smooth landing take little time. As
soon as the Kundalini pierces this, you feel

47:24.970 --> 47:31.900
thoughtless. There is no thought. So you may
try to see just now put your hands towards

47:31.900 --> 47:37.820
Me like this just because the centers are
here expressed of the sympathetic. Just put

47:37.820 --> 47:46.550
your attention to Me and see if your thoughts
have stopped. And then close your eyes. If

47:46.550 --> 47:56.420
that has happened that means Kundalini has
already gone above. It moves very fast, very

47:56.420 --> 48:03.170
fast it moves.
Now few things you have to accept in Sahaja

48:03.170 --> 48:10.780
Yoga. First of all you have to accept that
God is the ocean of forgiveness. That He’s

48:10.780 --> 48:20.420
ocean of love, He is compassion and you are
not guilty in His eyes at all. And you should

48:20.420 --> 48:29.610
not feel guilty before the ocean. So you have
to just say before starting your meditation

48:29.610 --> 48:34.440
that ‘Mother’, in your heart, ‘I am
not guilty’, ‘Mother, I am not guilty’,

48:34.440 --> 48:37.280
‘Mother, I am not guilty’. Thrice you
have to say.

48:37.280 --> 48:46.940
Now you have to forgive. You must forgive
everyone. Just say that, ‘I forgive’.

48:46.940 --> 48:51.250
Those who say, “It is very difficult to
forgive”, actually, not to forgive, what

48:51.250 --> 49:02.210
to forgive is all mental activity. What do
you do by that, just torture yourself? So

49:02.210 --> 49:10.040
please say that ‘I forgive’ and close
your eyes now. Say, ‘I forgive, Mother I

49:10.040 --> 49:17.210
forgive everyone’. Just say, ‘Mother I
forgive everyone’. Keep your feet on the

49:17.210 --> 49:25.710
ground both the sides touching and don’t
move much. Just say ‘Mother I forgive everyone’

49:25.710 --> 49:37.710
say it thrice. Now put your right hand on
your heart where the Spirit resides. And without

49:37.710 --> 49:43.620
feeling guilty, without feeling guilty, again
I say, without feeling guilty say that ‘if

49:43.620 --> 49:50.410
we have done any mistakes, please forgive
us, please forgive me’. Say this thrice

49:50.410 --> 49:59.640
from your heart – ‘if in my seeking, if
I have done mistake, if I have neglected my

49:59.640 --> 50:09.430
Spirit or if I have neglected my duties towards
my Spirit, please forgive me’. Just go on

50:09.430 --> 50:14.910
saying ‘please forgive me’. But don’t
feel guilty with it. You are not to feel guilty

50:14.910 --> 50:22.210
about it. Just say it that ‘please forgive
me’.

50:22.210 --> 50:26.100
I think you should again say, ‘I am not
guilty’ because as soon as you say that,

50:26.100 --> 50:34.160
there’s a catch on the left Vishuddhi, so
you say ‘please forgive me and also forgive

50:34.160 --> 50:47.310
me for being guilty’. That would be better.
Now you ask a question ‘Mother am I the

50:47.310 --> 50:54.320
Spirit?’ Ask the question ‘Mother am I
the Spirit?’ Ask thrice – ‘Mother am

50:54.320 --> 51:06.280
I the Spirit?’ You might feel cool breeze
coming in. You ask thrice. If not, now say

51:06.280 --> 51:18.540
‘Mother please give me my realization’.
Say it thrice. Just say it thrice. Then it

51:18.540 --> 51:24.100
would work out. You will start feeling the
cool breeze in the hand – left hand. Stretch

51:24.100 --> 51:35.110
it towards Me, little bit. Stretch it. Ask
for realization. Now don’t feel guilty.

51:35.110 --> 51:46.970
Are you are getting it now? Don’t feel guilty;
you are not to feel guilty. That’s the biggest

51:46.970 --> 51:52.760
disease of the West.
Now you put your right hand on the head and

51:52.760 --> 51:59.220
you might feel the cool breeze coming out
from your head. Just see if there’s a cool

51:59.220 --> 52:13.850
breeze coming in. Raise it higher, see may
be? Is it? Not feeling. In the hand? Not yet.

52:13.850 --> 52:22.740
Close your eyes and ask the question – ‘Mother
am I the Spirit?’ Thrice – ‘Mother am

52:22.740 --> 52:36.050
I the Spirit? Mother am I the Spirit?’ Now
ask for realization – ‘Mother please give

52:36.050 --> 52:46.250
me my realization’, thrice. Now you can
put your left hand on your head and right

52:46.250 --> 52:51.330
hand towards Me. Let’s say some people have
this problem you see. Right hand towards Me.

52:51.330 --> 53:07.060
Now, ask the question ‘Mother am I the Spirit?’
Ok thrice. Now you forgive, you just forgive,

53:07.060 --> 53:15.550
forgive, forgive everyone. Say, ‘I forgive,
I forgive’ once again, ‘I forgive, I forgive,

53:15.550 --> 53:16.740
I forgive’. Again, ‘I forgive’. All
right, getting it? Not yet? All right, if

53:16.740 --> 53:21.210
you won’t, now, not yet? We’ll see.
Are you? Little bit on the hands, just see,

53:21.210 --> 53:33.230
may be in the hand just see. It will work
out, it will work out. It takes little time

53:33.230 --> 53:36.200
but it works out, works out, it works out.
Don’t you worry; don’t get desperate with

53:36.200 --> 53:37.630
yourself. Keep your eyes shut. It will start
coming slowly, slowly, slowly; it will start

53:37.630 --> 53:37.890
working. It is very subtle but it starts working.
Now. I think open those windows to pass out

53:37.890 --> 53:38.850
some of these heats. Lot of heat is coming
out.

53:38.850 --> 53:42.540
Now just see. Douglas, Douglas, see your neighbor,
has he got it on his head? Just see, here

53:42.540 --> 53:46.570
him, just see him, not yet! He has got it,
he has got. That’s what I feel. Can you

53:46.570 --> 53:54.230
see all of you? You have got it. I knew, you
got it long time back. Now see, what about

53:54.230 --> 53:55.100
you? Just ask for forgiveness, a little bit,
all right, ask for forgiveness. Kathy, can

53:55.100 --> 53:56.350
you see? Can you see the gentleman next to
you? John! We’ll work it out, somebody will

53:56.350 --> 53:58.760
work it out. Don’t you be worried about
what they are doing because the Power is flowing

53:58.760 --> 54:18.330
from them so they are just working it out.
Who are all the new people, please raise your

54:18.330 --> 54:19.280
hands so they’ll come and help you. Just
go, come along. Ken, come along. Left Swadishtan

54:19.280 --> 54:21.310
– you have to say the mantra of Nirmala
Vidya to get over the left Swadishtana, is

54:21.310 --> 54:35.380
quite a lot.
[Mother speaks in Marathi].

54:35.380 --> 54:41.810
It’s all right I think, a little liver,
a little. How is the lady? She has left, left

54:41.810 --> 54:48.290
Nabhi. Ask her to put her right hand on the
left Nabhi. She’ll be all right.

54:48.290 --> 54:52.070
[NOT AUDIBLE]
Felicity, are you all right, better? Please

54:52.070 --> 54:57.510
do not feel guilty. If it has taken time,
don’t you feel guilty. What’s the matter?

54:57.510 --> 55:01.770
Jamail, right heart. Please don’t feel guilty,
what are you guilty about, don’t feel guilty,

55:01.770 --> 55:04.890
all right. There is nothing to feel guilty,
what is there to feel guilty? I mean what

55:04.890 --> 55:08.150
crime have you committed? She has got it actually,
enjoying. Now, how is this gentleman, right

55:08.150 --> 55:11.540
Vishuddhi? Left? You are feeling guilty, Mr.
all right. Yes, now put your left hand like

55:11.540 --> 55:17.740
this towards Me. And now put your right hand
here and now say that you are not guilty at

55:17.740 --> 55:23.980
all. ‘I am not guilty’, just say it to
yourself, say it thrice, again.
