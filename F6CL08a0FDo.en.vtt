00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.940
﻿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:54.780
We are seeking truth, reality,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.161
not hallucinations,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.500
not imagination,

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:02.403
not our own mental projections.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.689
We have not being yet able,

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:08.860
many of us who are seeking, understand

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:11.739
that reality is what it is.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.662
It will be the same. It has been the same.

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:17.736
We cannot

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.444
coin it for ourselves.

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:23.656
We cannot organise it,

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.580
and we cannot think about it.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.762
We cannot put a mental projection of our own

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.215
as to, “This is the reality and this is not the reality.”

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:36.105
Today only I was reading

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:37.978
with great surprise an article

00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:40.740
about sniffing the glue that people are doing.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.140
I mean, now this is the last they are sniffing now,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.540
and then petrol, all sorts of things.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.460
Well, why? Why are they doing it?

00:01:50.224 --> 00:01:52.340
Because for some sensation.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.690
But they said that when you do that, what happens

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.026
that you start believing

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:03.249
that whatever you are doing is right.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.180
That exactly is the point today.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.460
Without sniffing also there are many who believe like that,

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.893
that whatever their ideas are about God

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.660
or about Spirit, about seeking,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.075
is the right thing

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:23.843
and they don’t want to see what reality is.

00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:28.517
They just want to

00:02:31.332 --> 00:02:34.700
project their ego,

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:36.980
their imagination,

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:39.900
to believe that this is the reality,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.858
and then they just

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.580
are convinced that they know everything.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020
With such people,

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.873
what to do? How to tell them

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.420
that reality is something very different?

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:04.295
Now what happens when we put our mental projections like this?

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:08.460
We conceive things, we read books, we form our own ideas.

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:13.104
It’s a very dangerous thing that can happen to human beings:

00:03:13.448 --> 00:03:15.068
and that is

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:17.820
your ego starts bloating,

00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:21.740
becoming big and big and big without your knowledge.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.960
A person who has an ego

00:03:25.592 --> 00:03:29.004
does not harm himself at all. He harms others.

00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:32.358
He doesn’t harm anyone

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:36.065
as such but he harms in a way

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:39.688
which can be very deep hurting.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.054
He’ll say things which will hurt a person.

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.483
He’ll do things that will hurt.

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.902
Nations after nations can be destroyed with this ego,

00:03:51.103 --> 00:03:52.768
like Hitler did.

00:03:54.137 --> 00:03:57.100
So when you put your mental projections like this, “I can do it.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.660
I can find it. I know. I know. I believe,”

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.220
then this ego, you see,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.660
grows in your head.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.135
If it was only your head nothing to bother,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.005
but it grows round your heart,

00:04:13.927 --> 00:04:16.380
it grows round your heart

00:04:17.672 --> 00:04:21.016
and your heart becomes like a stone.

00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:24.496
You cannot feel

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.437
anything that is real.

00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:32.410
You cannot understand what is real and what is unreal.

00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:36.024
All his discrimination is lost completely.

00:04:38.446 --> 00:04:42.009
I went to Bangalore and there were some

00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:46.258
very ordinary people working in gardens and things like that.

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:48.840
They saw me

00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:53.405
and they recognised, not difficult.

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:55.141
One lady came and told me,

00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:57.829
“My son has gone away for two years.

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.461
He was only fourteen; now he must be sixteen

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:05.950
and I know you can call him back.” I said, “How do you know?”

00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:07.780
She said, “We know who you are.”

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.452
Just seeing my face, can you imagine?

00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:12.942
Such sensitivity they had.

00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:17.816
I said, “All right,” and the boy came back after two days.

00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:20.560
But look at their quality.

00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:24.440
The whole level of sensitivity is lost with this ego.

00:05:25.728 --> 00:05:27.900
When Rama went to jungle

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.900
– as you know he was sent away

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.710
– everyone recognised them, who were in the jungle

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.120
leading a very normal life.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:39.724
But today it’s getting worse and worse and worse.

00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:42.063
We have no eyes to see.

00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:44.672
We have no sensitivity to understand.

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:48.373
We have our own images

00:05:48.573 --> 00:05:50.860
built around us; such barriers.

00:05:51.303 --> 00:05:54.245
We have lost all sensitivity to reality,

00:05:54.446 --> 00:05:56.620
to goodness, to Divinity, to love,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.917
to affection, to compassion,

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:07.052
and that’s why it is so difficult, it’s very difficult.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:10.082
Even when we say we are seeking reality,

00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:12.023
it’s kind of a big

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:15.254
announcement of the ego.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:19.524
But there are many who do believe
we have found the reality, we know reality,

00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:22.990
we have full conception of reality and this is what it is.

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:28.620
If, suppose, tomorrow Christ comes,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.860
who is going to recognise Him?

00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:33.478
Not you.

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:37.505
Not the people who are living in the cities, not them.

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:40.074
But when He goes

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:44.219
in the forests to simple village people they will,

00:06:45.396 --> 00:06:47.540
because they haven’t lost that,

00:06:48.328 --> 00:06:50.740
they are still there in the centre.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.399
This ego develops with so many things:

00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.707
money, one thing.

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:03.739
Sometimes the belief that we are moneyed people also can.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.715
Power,

00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:10.672
I mean, as soon as somebody becomes a
minister you should say he is completely changed:

00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:13.820
his face is changed, his style is changed, his talking is changed.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.220
They have forgotten what life is like.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.412
There’s no fun in their life, no fun at all,

00:07:20.912 --> 00:07:23.138
just like dried fishes.

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:26.917
Better not go near them, otherwise you will get the stink of their

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:28.766
ego!

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:34.527
This is what is the problem today, the present day.

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.302
Sahaj Yogis get upset about it.

00:07:38.503 --> 00:07:40.900
“Why, Mother, people don’t

00:07:41.304 --> 00:07:43.313
progress in Sahaj Yoga?”

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.759
First they have their own conception.

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:51.513
You tell them, “This is Sahaja Yoga,”

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.893
and as you have to tell somebody this is reality

00:07:55.093 --> 00:07:56.767
– say you say this is diamond

00:07:56.968 --> 00:08:00.860
– then you have to also remove all the obstructions which are

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.326
on top of that to show you that this is reality.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.462
The wisdom lies in understanding:

00:08:07.662 --> 00:08:09.631
“What it is let’s see for ourselves.”

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:12.985
That’s the soundness of a character, if you have,

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.260
at least you will settle down

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.544
and try to see what it is.

00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:21.439
Instead of that people just get angry. “Oh we don’t believe it!”

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.100
But you don’t believe with what?

00:08:25.482 --> 00:08:27.555
You haven’t got the sensitivity

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:30.860
to know what to believe, what not to believe.

00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:36.592
But it is even much more dangerous than that

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:41.592
because when you have to seek,

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.544
because that’s your nature.

00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:47.246
You have been seeking all your lives, not this life.

00:08:47.447 --> 00:08:48.860
And when you come

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.540
again to seek in this life which is a special time,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.420
you are always enamoured by something that is unreal,

00:08:57.324 --> 00:09:00.087
that appeals to your ego or to your superego:

00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:02.980
means a person, if he can somehow or other

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.540
give you some sort of a sensation

00:09:05.991 --> 00:09:08.260
or some sort of mesmerism,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.460
you think, “Oh, this is wonderful! I felt so happy. I was very high!”

00:09:12.997 --> 00:09:15.500
Just like getting intoxicated.

00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:19.334
But what have you achieved? Is the point, by that.

00:09:19.933 --> 00:09:21.757
Like if you take some sort of this

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:23.859
glue business, I don’t know what happens.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.680
Today, somehow, I have been reading

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.736
three articles on such things.

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.740
Something like cocaine they said is the modern trouble now.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.405
The drugs are out, now the cocaine.

00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:37.656
With all of this intelligence,

00:09:38.015 --> 00:09:39.580
with all this

00:09:39.964 --> 00:09:41.980
knowledge that you have gathered,

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:45.851
if you have to end up your life with cocaine and glue,

00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:48.746
where is the wisdom?

00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:51.980
When you have to

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.620
select something for your life,

00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:57.267
for the fun of your life,

00:09:57.468 --> 00:09:59.604
for the beauty of your life,

00:10:00.207 --> 00:10:01.707
what do you select?

00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:03.715
Something that is going to destroy you?

00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:06.460
You see others are destroyed:

00:10:07.121 --> 00:10:08.685
still you go to it.

00:10:10.912 --> 00:10:13.091
This is the danger of this horrible

00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:15.700
ego which we have created of our own.

00:10:16.114 --> 00:10:18.408
But it may also take you to people

00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:21.100
who will pamper your ego. For example, somebody says,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.765
“All right, in this hall if you have to come, pay hundred pounds,

00:10:24.965 --> 00:10:26.608
otherwise, you cannot enter.”

00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:29.159
You’ll be surprised this hall will be filled completely,

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:31.880
by all the big, big cars will be standing here,

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.031
and people will be just sitting here,

00:10:34.232 --> 00:10:36.943
as if they are going to races:

00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:39.991
who pays more is the competition.

00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:43.619
In the elite society, you will be surprised,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.125
the talk is like this, “Who is your guru?”

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:49.580
“What are you going to do this time?”

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.893
They said, “I have tried this. I have paid

00:10:52.093 --> 00:10:54.300
about five thousand pounds.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.061
Now I think I’ll have to go somewhere with ten thousand pounds.”

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.100
It's really, that’s the talk they have and they talk like that.

00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:09.181
If it was only stupidity that you achieved through your ego,

00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:11.911
it’s not so dangerous.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.907
But discrimination

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:17.020
is completely lost

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.900
and always you are enamoured

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.220
more by unreal things,

00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:28.872
and with little understanding,

00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:31.740
with little intelligence you can understand.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.510
Very little is needed.

00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:36.731
You don’t have to read books to understand that,

00:11:37.035 --> 00:11:39.035
but that simple common sense

00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:41.236
of a village folk you don’t have.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.700
Like, I remember my

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.559
granddaughter once

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.134
went with her father and mother

00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:53.806
to a lama. She is a realised soul

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:55.802
– the parents are not

00:11:56.362 --> 00:11:59.299
– and this lama had shaved his head completely

00:11:59.647 --> 00:12:01.580
and was sitting with a big

00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.125
robe.

00:12:06.498 --> 00:12:07.998
So, first

00:12:08.434 --> 00:12:10.771
everybody was going. She was looking at him.

00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:13.483
She couldn’t understand what this fellow is up to because

00:12:13.683 --> 00:12:15.581
everybody was touching his feet,

00:12:16.265 --> 00:12:18.259
and then the father went and

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:21.475
touched his feet and when the mother
went and touched his feet she couldn’t bear it.

00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:25.741
She was only five years of age. She just put back
her hands like this and stood before him, she said,

00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:28.486
“Why are you such a hypocrite?

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.445
You are not a realised-soul.

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:33.581
Just by shaving your head and by wearing this dress

00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:35.940
do you become a realised-soul?”

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.221
She just stood before him – a five-year-old child!

00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.460
And the parents were rather embarrassed.

00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:45.910
And the fellow didn’t know where to look when she said

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.700
– in Hindi they say ‘paar’ – “You are not even paar.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.123
How are you sitting there and
asking everybody to touch your feet?

00:12:52.323 --> 00:12:53.818
What right have you?”

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:57.018
And then the parents got embarrassed and said, “You shouldn’t say like that.”

00:12:57.219 --> 00:12:59.986
She said, “I would not have said if you had not touched his feet.”

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.318
See, the five-year-old child!

00:13:03.565 --> 00:13:07.116
And otherwise she is a very mild, sweet person. She stood up.

00:13:10.732 --> 00:13:13.789
But somebody comes as la-ma – finished!

00:13:15.634 --> 00:13:19.221
If somebody is coming here lama for us, he is the greatest.

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:23.698
Then he tells us that, “You have to go to Shambala

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.203
in the Gobi Desert!”

00:13:26.403 --> 00:13:29.700
We are all packing our things, going to Gobi Desert to die there.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.700
What else? Is there any Nirvana written

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.700
that Gobi desert?

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:40.711
This is what is happening to the seekers

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:43.980
who have been seeking for ages and ages

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.220
and they have come

00:13:47.429 --> 00:13:50.461
on this earth deliberately

00:13:50.889 --> 00:13:52.579
to get their Realisation.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.620
And there they are ending up their lives

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.854
in Gobi Desert!

00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:02.440
But if anybody tells them,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.854
“That’s not the thing. That’s not the reality,”

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.090
then they get very angry. “Why should you criticise?”

00:14:13.065 --> 00:14:14.755
But the main thing is:

00:14:15.495 --> 00:14:18.300
you have to find it for yourself.

00:14:20.744 --> 00:14:22.994
You have to understand that

00:14:23.194 --> 00:14:26.627
the power has to work through you.

00:14:28.945 --> 00:14:31.940
Just like blind we see going under a cover.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.817
If somebody says, “Three thousand pounds.”
“All right.” Then, “Six thousand pounds,” “All right”,

00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:39.185
then, “Ten thousand pounds,” “All right.” And just walking

00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:41.276
towards the hell.

00:14:41.973 --> 00:14:43.558
That’s what it is.

00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:46.860
You can’t pay for God.

00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:50.280
You can’t pay.

00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:56.660
You can’t read about Him.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.430
You have to experience.

00:14:58.938 --> 00:15:01.133
And the experience when it is yours,

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:03.306
you become part and parcel

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:05.190
of God Almighty.

00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.783
You become the power.

00:15:11.507 --> 00:15:14.460
Perhaps very few human beings realise

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.493
how delicately,

00:15:16.693 --> 00:15:18.281
beautifully,

00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:21.300
for so many ages God has worked

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.334
on human beings to create you, today.

00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:27.632
And the seekers are a special category of people.

00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:34.437
But modern times are the worst times and the best times

00:15:36.025 --> 00:15:39.730
because all kinds of negative forces are working now.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.300
First they have built up your ego

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.780
and now this ego is fed by people

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.020
who are utilising you.

00:15:50.948 --> 00:15:52.947
And after that

00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:55.503
you have lost

00:15:55.752 --> 00:15:57.340
even the concept,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.472
the idea, as to what to find.

00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:05.260
This is the situation of today’s seekers.

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:13.708
England is doing well now: I’m very happy about it.

00:16:14.744 --> 00:16:16.619
I had to work hard

00:16:16.915 --> 00:16:20.790
but English are still sound people.

00:16:21.607 --> 00:16:23.820
They have been able to see through

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.420
the truth of Sahaj Yoga.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.940
They have been able to absorb.

00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:33.670
But when you say, I have to go to America, I shudder;

00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:36.079
I really tell you, I shudder.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:40.050
Because they have become so shallow now,

00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:43.190
with all these gurus going there and all kinds of ideas

00:16:43.391 --> 00:16:45.538
that they have, even witchcraft.

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:49.021
I mean they have accepted all that is wrong.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.507
One can understand indiscretion,

00:16:51.707 --> 00:16:53.898
but discretion only

00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:58.433
going towards all that is wrong, all that is anti-God,

00:16:58.634 --> 00:17:00.813
all that is anti-life,

00:17:02.943 --> 00:17:04.445
is some sort of a

00:17:04.645 --> 00:17:08.274
negative attraction or fraternity. I don’t know what to call it.

00:17:10.223 --> 00:17:13.334
While the mental projections are so built-up

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.420
that’s it’s a very big barrier.

00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:20.396
Now, how do we break that in Sahaja Yoga?

00:17:20.597 --> 00:17:23.566
We should try to understand how we break

00:17:23.766 --> 00:17:26.838
these ego and superego barriers within human beings.

00:17:27.203 --> 00:17:30.884
Not by lecturing you – it cannot work out through lectures.

00:17:31.085 --> 00:17:34.660
Not by any kind of brainwashing or anything.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.481
We can at the most prepare you

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:39.353
to open your mind, that’s all.

00:17:39.553 --> 00:17:42.900
But one has to understand

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.140
that human awareness is not yet complete.

00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:49.325
Through our human awareness

00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:52.295
we cannot understand God,

00:17:55.091 --> 00:17:57.050
only through our spirit.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.203
We have to become the Spirit.

00:17:59.404 --> 00:18:02.333
Every gospel, every scripture,

00:18:02.534 --> 00:18:04.227
every religion has said,

00:18:04.427 --> 00:18:07.620
“You have to be the Spirit.”

00:18:09.118 --> 00:18:12.629
That means anybody can say, “Now we have become Spiritualists,

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.523
or we have become spirits.”

00:18:14.723 --> 00:18:17.740
This is another identification one can have.

00:18:18.238 --> 00:18:20.398
You have to become Spirit, means the

00:18:20.598 --> 00:18:23.740
quality of Spirit must manifest through you:

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:26.980
through your attention,

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.060
through your awareness

00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:31.420
and through your personality.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.214
If it is not happening you cannot just brand yourself, like,

00:18:36.422 --> 00:18:39.183
I can say, “I am a Catholic,” or,

00:18:39.383 --> 00:18:41.900
“I am a Hindu or a Muslim.” It’s not like that.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.060
You cannot just put a label to a person saying that, “Now,

00:18:45.321 --> 00:18:48.918
I am a person who is a self-realised person.”

00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:54.660
It is your being which has to express that.

00:18:55.541 --> 00:18:57.860
You have to become,

00:19:00.225 --> 00:19:03.820
just by accepting mentally that, “I am such and such!”

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.765
I mean, they play all kinds of tricks. They’ll give you a name:

00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:09.580
Shivanand and Dayanand and all sorts of

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.860
Bhonganand, as we call them.

00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:14.391
And they go on the streets and say,

00:19:14.591 --> 00:19:17.281
“Oh, I am such and such. My name is such and such.”

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:21.940
I mean, even if you call yourself ‘donkey’ you don’t become a donkey.

00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:25.194
Then how can you become a realised-soul

00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:27.260
if you call yourself a realised-soul?

00:19:27.914 --> 00:19:29.619
You are what you are,

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.093
but you have to become. And that becoming

00:19:32.293 --> 00:19:35.813
is a living process of a living God.

00:19:37.645 --> 00:19:40.233
It’s not a process where you start jumping, dancing.

00:19:40.434 --> 00:19:41.949
No, it is not.

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:44.691
It’s a living process

00:19:45.023 --> 00:19:48.357
and we cannot do living processes.

00:19:49.045 --> 00:19:50.917
It’s done by nature:

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.358
spontaneously, sahaja,

00:19:54.075 --> 00:19:55.600
by God.

00:19:56.389 --> 00:19:58.500
So the process of Realisation

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.540
is the awakening of the Kundalini

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.260
which lies in the triangular bone.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.889
We haven’t go here.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.036
Can you come and show them, someone?

00:20:10.092 --> 00:20:12.260
In the triangular bone you see this,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.940
lying in three and a half

00:20:15.686 --> 00:20:17.186
coils.

00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:23.140
This is the energy that

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.726
is resting in the triangular bone

00:20:25.927 --> 00:20:28.020
called as Sacrum.

00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:32.580
Greeks knew it was a sacred bone; so, they called it Sacrum.

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:36.180
When I asked them they said they had a rapport

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.183
with Indians long, long time back,

00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:41.420
and they discovered that this is a sacred bone.

00:20:42.848 --> 00:20:45.780
This sacred bone lies within you

00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:49.147
and the sacred energy also lies within you

00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:51.180
unharmed,

00:20:51.873 --> 00:20:54.570
absolutely waiting there.

00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:57.536
Now this is the energy

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.136
of your pure desire.

00:21:03.844 --> 00:21:07.856
I don’t know if we have any idea of purity left in the modern times.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.341
You eat anything, it is contaminated.

00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:13.980
You smoke something in the air,

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.820
so, you contaminate everything.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.045
You hear music which is contaminated.

00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:20.222
Everything is contaminated.

00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:24.197
So, the sense of purity is only existing in that

00:21:24.397 --> 00:21:26.660
power of ours which is a pure desire,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.420
not a perverted desire

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.180
or not a spoiled desire, or mixed-up desire,

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.095
but a pure desire to be one with the Divine:

00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:39.534
to be in the Yoga, to be united

00:21:39.735 --> 00:21:43.446
with the Divine Power that is all-pervading,

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.694
the power of love of God.

00:21:47.184 --> 00:21:49.820
That’s the purest desire we have

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.940
because all other desires have no meaning.

00:21:54.047 --> 00:21:56.820
Whatever desires we have otherwise,

00:21:57.693 --> 00:22:00.316
you know, never give us satisfaction.

00:22:01.365 --> 00:22:03.132
We jump from one to another.

00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:06.945
But once this pure absolute desire rises within us

00:22:07.145 --> 00:22:09.890
– it should rise – as an energy,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.275
then we have no other desire.

00:22:15.425 --> 00:22:17.420
Then the whole situation changes.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.980
When you are facing me you are desireless,

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.500
but then you come and sit with me and watch others.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.500
The whole situation changes.

00:22:26.864 --> 00:22:28.608
You become

00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:31.195
self-realised.

00:22:31.396 --> 00:22:33.900
When this desire awakens within you,

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.540
passes through six centres

00:22:36.836 --> 00:22:38.660
crosses through this centre,

00:22:38.927 --> 00:22:42.567
then you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:22:42.768 --> 00:22:44.643
Now, this nobody can do.

00:22:44.843 --> 00:22:46.810
Can anybody do like that?

00:22:47.011 --> 00:22:49.943
All these gurus make you jump, pay them money.

00:22:50.143 --> 00:22:52.580
Tell them, “We’ll give you a thousand pounds

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.156
if you can really put the cool breeze out of our heads!”

00:22:56.357 --> 00:22:59.180
Or even ten thousand pounds if they want!

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.145
Even millions and billions of pounds they cannot do it,

00:23:05.643 --> 00:23:07.643
because they are not authorised.

00:23:12.263 --> 00:23:13.780
So this is what it is:

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.343
that we have to ask for reality

00:23:17.694 --> 00:23:20.342
– the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:25.420
This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us,

00:23:26.434 --> 00:23:29.330
and that we have to feel on top of our head,

00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:32.422
and then in our fingers it should flow.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.418
Then we should say

00:23:35.618 --> 00:23:37.916
that the Spirit has come into our attention,

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:41.744
into our central nervous system because we are feeling it now.

00:23:42.352 --> 00:23:44.888
That’s how we have to believe in it.

00:23:45.686 --> 00:23:48.585
But that’s not sufficient. That’s not the end of it, as you know,

00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:51.877
so many of you: you have to work it out.

00:23:52.586 --> 00:23:54.846
Now why this working is needed?

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.500
Because there are lots of impurities.

00:24:00.888 --> 00:24:04.314
Not to feel guilty about it – whatever has happened has happened

00:24:04.514 --> 00:24:06.260
– but there are impurities.

00:24:06.953 --> 00:24:08.900
This is your rebirth.

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:11.878
When the bird comes out of the egg, the little bit of egg is

00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:14.700
still sticking on to him so he has to clean that bit off.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.660
And then you become a different personality altogether.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.463
Then the reality can be understood because

00:24:22.663 --> 00:24:24.828
you are that which can see the reality:

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:26.629
you have become the Spirit.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.660
Without becoming the Spirit you cannot see the reality.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.863
You cannot understand the reality.

00:24:33.064 --> 00:24:34.901
Before that, as I said,

00:24:35.101 --> 00:24:37.812
it is your own mental projection,

00:24:38.461 --> 00:24:42.463
it’s your own hallucination, imagination.

00:24:44.651 --> 00:24:46.940
The entire concept

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.180
is a myth.

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.380
You will discover that very soon when you become that.

00:24:53.654 --> 00:24:55.868
But what’s the harm in becoming that?

00:24:56.069 --> 00:24:58.622
Because for that you have been seeking.

00:24:59.837 --> 00:25:02.060
And that is what

00:25:03.363 --> 00:25:06.366
one should understand that,

00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:08.851
“I have to become.

00:25:09.757 --> 00:25:12.220
I have to become that special being.

00:25:12.937 --> 00:25:15.060
I have to be the Spirit.

00:25:16.346 --> 00:25:18.380
I have to be the instrument

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.346
of that Divine Power.

00:25:21.092 --> 00:25:24.948
I have to understand all the working of that Divine Power.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.680
I have to purify myself.

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:31.727
I have to cleanse myself through that Divine Power.”

00:25:32.379 --> 00:25:33.900
Some people ask me,

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.260
“Mother, it’s very difficult to awaken the Kundalini?”

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.700
I said, “Maybe for some; not for me!”

00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:42.025
It’s true, it’s not for me.

00:25:43.143 --> 00:25:45.640
But why not for me? That, I don’t want to tell.

00:25:45.841 --> 00:25:47.596
That, you have to find out for yourself.

00:25:48.052 --> 00:25:49.549
But it’s true.

00:25:50.933 --> 00:25:53.194
It is easy for me, no doubt,

00:25:53.401 --> 00:25:55.537
and it will be easy for you also

00:25:55.737 --> 00:25:57.401
– you will be surprised.

00:26:02.579 --> 00:26:05.340
Actually, Sahaj Yogis are very humble people:

00:26:05.602 --> 00:26:08.002
you have no idea how humble they are.

00:26:08.618 --> 00:26:10.167
The other day

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.516
they had somebody in Bombay who came to see me

00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:15.758
and he told me, “Mother,

00:26:15.959 --> 00:26:19.113
there’s one guru,” who is a real guru, I should say.

00:26:19.562 --> 00:26:21.781
“I have been with him for fourteen years,

00:26:21.982 --> 00:26:25.485
and he has been making me do this and do that,” – fourteen years!

00:26:26.012 --> 00:26:29.180
– “and one day I came to a programme, I got my Realisation

00:26:29.425 --> 00:26:32.380
and now I can give Realisation to others.

00:26:33.685 --> 00:26:36.337
So I went and saw my guru and I told him,

00:26:37.757 --> 00:26:39.300
that, ‘How is it

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.700
that you recognise Mother?

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.940
You know about Her. You talk about Her,

00:26:44.141 --> 00:26:46.595
and you took fourteen years just to cleanse me and

00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:50.780
I haven’t got my Realisation? Now, here I can give Realisation.’

00:26:53.293 --> 00:26:56.644
”So he said, “Better not talk about it.

00:26:57.199 --> 00:27:00.083
Now you better give Realisations to others, I can’t.

00:27:01.628 --> 00:27:03.288
You are specially blessed.”

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:05.089
– it’s a fact.

00:27:05.681 --> 00:27:07.820
But Sahaj Yogis are so simple,

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.260
so humble,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.860
they are better than all these gurus put together,

00:27:14.111 --> 00:27:16.020
but they won’t that.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.940
They have become,

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.811
and all of you who are here for the first time or second time,

00:27:22.012 --> 00:27:23.540
all of you have to become.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.140
But you have to have patience with yourself.

00:27:26.826 --> 00:27:29.912
We have patience, we have love, compassion, everything,

00:27:30.113 --> 00:27:32.312
but you must have love for yourself

00:27:32.513 --> 00:27:34.084
and awareness that

00:27:34.284 --> 00:27:36.673
you are not an ordinary person.

00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:41.820
You are a seeker, a special category of a person.

00:27:42.537 --> 00:27:45.100
We can’t work on mediocres.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.660
You are men of God

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.100
as described by William Blake. You are that.

00:27:52.746 --> 00:27:55.980
Now, if you want to waste your life with sniffing that glue,

00:27:56.257 --> 00:27:58.057
what are we to do?

00:28:01.173 --> 00:28:04.552
Or you want to pay some sort of a

00:28:05.332 --> 00:28:08.300
fraud personality,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.002
what are we to do?

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.109
Except that

00:28:15.101 --> 00:28:16.820
we can only

00:28:20.295 --> 00:28:21.869
pray for you

00:28:22.184 --> 00:28:25.980
that you should come back to right path and get your

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.300
wisdom back so that you get your Realisation.

00:28:30.212 --> 00:28:34.212
That’s the only thing we have to do is to give you Realisation

00:28:34.776 --> 00:28:38.420
so that you also know how to give Realisations to others.

00:28:39.895 --> 00:28:42.900
There are so many myths working: like, one lady told me,

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.700
“Nobody can do anything for anyone.”

00:28:46.056 --> 00:28:47.605
But why not?

00:28:50.245 --> 00:28:54.091
If by getting Realisation you become what you have to become,

00:28:54.291 --> 00:28:56.500
why not? Why have these

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.209
barriers before give these explanations

00:28:59.409 --> 00:29:00.972
beforehand?

00:29:02.097 --> 00:29:04.998
Like, you tell somebody, “All right,

00:29:05.198 --> 00:29:07.620
now tomorrow we would like to buy,

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.780
say, a particular

00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:11.865
type of a thing.”

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:15.932
So, the person should say,
“All right, let’s go and find out,” normally,

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.820
“Let’s go and find out if it’s open.”

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.180
But ego is there, so the ego says,

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.900
“But it may not be there.”

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.260
I mean, if it is not there we’ll not buy it!

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.263
Simple as that. But why before buying that, or going there,

00:29:28.463 --> 00:29:32.463
why give such an explanation as that, that it may not be there?

00:29:34.504 --> 00:29:36.211
That is what it is,

00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:39.700
that you have to get your Realisation,

00:29:40.034 --> 00:29:42.503
you have to become what you are,

00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:46.504
you have to understand how it works.

00:29:46.705 --> 00:29:48.705
It’s all your own.

00:29:50.235 --> 00:29:51.846
Supposing

00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:56.380
all your treasure is locked up in a bank and I am a banker

00:29:56.665 --> 00:29:58.166
and you come to me.

00:29:58.367 --> 00:30:00.509
Then I have to give you your keys

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.520
and I have to tell you how to open

00:30:03.721 --> 00:30:05.860
your treasures and what do they mean,

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.620
isn’t it? That’s my duty.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.100
But if I am doing that duty people ask me,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.889
“Why should you do it?”

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.890
Because I am the banker!

00:30:15.092 --> 00:30:17.238
“So, why are you the banker?” Better go and ask

00:30:17.438 --> 00:30:19.460
God why I am the banker!

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.846
But can you become the banker? You cannot!

00:30:23.128 --> 00:30:25.956
But when you become, you will become.

00:30:26.565 --> 00:30:28.148
When you are not, you are not.

00:30:28.356 --> 00:30:32.267
When you will be appointed as a
banker you will be acting as a banker, too.

00:30:32.774 --> 00:30:35.285
It’s as simple as that.

00:30:37.411 --> 00:30:39.821
So you get your Realisation

00:30:40.616 --> 00:30:43.880
and you understand those who have got it have got it.

00:30:45.591 --> 00:30:47.900
Even you will be surprised once

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.300
I gave Realisation to one gentleman.

00:30:51.945 --> 00:30:53.917
He never came to Sahaj Yoga as such,

00:30:54.117 --> 00:30:56.340
and he didn’t become much.

00:30:58.424 --> 00:31:00.300
So one day he went to

00:31:00.969 --> 00:31:02.609
see a judge,

00:31:04.257 --> 00:31:07.060
a justice in the high court in Bombay,

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.740
who was a realised-soul, too; Mr. Vaidya.

00:31:11.496 --> 00:31:13.420
So, Mr. Vaidya asked him,

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.660
“Do you know Mataji Nirmala Devi?” He said, “Yes.”

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.997
“Did she give you Realisation?” “Yes.”

00:31:19.197 --> 00:31:22.180
“I know.” “How do you know, sir?”

00:31:22.615 --> 00:31:24.260
He said, “I can feel it.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.420
Of course, it’s very mild but it’s flowing.”

00:31:30.512 --> 00:31:33.260
Still the Divine is working,

00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:35.253
but why not cooperate,

00:31:35.453 --> 00:31:37.740
and why not help the Divine?

00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:41.036
Why not make the best out of it?

00:31:41.237 --> 00:31:44.820
A little bit of cooperation and understanding and will-power

00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:48.762
can give you everything that you have.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.830
It’s all your own and you have to have it.

00:31:52.213 --> 00:31:54.702
I am very happy to come back to London now

00:31:54.903 --> 00:31:56.413
to talk to you.

00:31:56.886 --> 00:31:59.326
I think London

00:31:59.537 --> 00:32:01.420
and England as a whole

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.780
has very sound Sahaj Yogis, very sound,

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.020
sensible, wise,

00:32:07.776 --> 00:32:09.900
hard-working Sahaj Yogis.

00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:15.380
And the youth of England

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.980
are really the best today in the West.

00:32:22.197 --> 00:32:24.020
They are not shallow

00:32:24.948 --> 00:32:27.180
and they are not such

00:32:28.123 --> 00:32:31.420
wobbly things like Americans.

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:36.740
And they are not bound by the idea of death

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.100
like the Switzerland people are.

00:32:39.358 --> 00:32:42.460
Swiss people are on one side
doing Sahaj Yoga and on the other side

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.980
planning how to commit suicide.

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:51.740
And they are not miserable like French are:

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.060
they are so miserable that they want to drink away their life

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.596
and indulge in prostitution

00:32:57.796 --> 00:32:59.880
because they are extremely miserable.

00:33:00.705 --> 00:33:02.300
They don’t want to laugh, you see.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.140
They think to laugh is a sinful thing.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.020
But all other sins you can commit:
as long as you don’t laugh, it’s all right.

00:33:12.375 --> 00:33:15.580
You should never have any fun in life. If you have fun

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.500
you should do all the sins with great seriousness

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.100
then it’s all right, it’s no sin.

00:33:22.926 --> 00:33:26.119
It’s a funny idea of detachment they have developed!

00:33:28.232 --> 00:33:29.840
So we have Italians,

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:31.950
who are good for emotional,

00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:34.700
who are very good at recognising me.

00:33:35.737 --> 00:33:37.540
But to understand Sahaja Yoga

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.100
a little more soundness is needed.

00:33:40.567 --> 00:33:43.144
They’ll settle down very soon, I think.

00:33:43.345 --> 00:33:44.968
But basically

00:33:45.234 --> 00:33:48.159
they are very sensitive people, very sensitive.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.180
But sensitivity is not sufficient:

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.220
you must have soundness behind it. Even if you are sensitive

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.980
and you recognise me, you must have that soundness

00:33:58.031 --> 00:33:59.872
to understand

00:34:00.151 --> 00:34:02.207
the immense

00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:09.100
advantages of Sahaj Yoga,

00:34:09.761 --> 00:34:12.200
the greatest dynamics

00:34:12.957 --> 00:34:14.500
of Sahaj Yog.

00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:17.913
This is the solution of all the problems of the world,

00:34:18.114 --> 00:34:19.631
believe me.

00:34:20.035 --> 00:34:22.220
Today I had to attend a dinner

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.220
on a ship and I was chief

00:34:26.243 --> 00:34:28.111
guest, chief guest.

00:34:28.312 --> 00:34:31.553
But I just told my husband that, “Today, please excuse me.

00:34:31.837 --> 00:34:33.720
This is God’s work

00:34:36.985 --> 00:34:40.020
and nobody can do that but me. I have to do it,

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.620
so please excuse me.” He said, “It’s all right. It’s all right.”

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.835
Normally he would not because I was one of the

00:34:47.036 --> 00:34:50.233
- I mean, he was a chief guest,
I was his wife. I was supposed to be there

00:34:50.434 --> 00:34:52.070
and on the ship and everything.

00:34:52.271 --> 00:34:55.548
But when I said, “This is God’s work. That’s important.”

00:34:55.899 --> 00:34:57.437
He also feels

00:34:58.557 --> 00:35:00.380
the importance of this work.

00:35:02.987 --> 00:35:05.540
So if you have that intelligence,

00:35:05.825 --> 00:35:09.797
basic intelligence, also you can see how important it is today.

00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:16.860
I am happy today; those who are new will get their Realisation.

00:35:17.483 --> 00:35:19.260
But not only getting their Realisation:

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.100
you have to keep

00:35:22.301 --> 00:35:24.980
in a way that you proceed further with it,

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.935
grow further with it. You have to have patience.

00:35:28.433 --> 00:35:30.780
You have to understand it

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.020
in a very sound and a wise manner.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.140
You have to have your wisdom completely intact

00:35:37.863 --> 00:35:39.616
and give a chance to yourself.

00:35:39.817 --> 00:35:42.779
Just don’t discard it, “Oh! I haven’t felt it!”

00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:44.867
As if some people are proud of it!

00:35:45.068 --> 00:35:47.300
If they haven’t felt it there’s something wrong

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.451
and they have to feel it.

00:35:52.982 --> 00:35:55.249
I am sure this will work out today

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.370
and add to our Sahaja Yoga people

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.489
which is the solution of all the problems,

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.330
of all the problems.

00:36:06.695 --> 00:36:10.328
In India there was a speaker called Mr. Bagde

00:36:10.529 --> 00:36:13.660
who invited me to his speech in a village he had gone,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.404
in a district place.

00:36:15.605 --> 00:36:17.860
And there was a big crowd and he was addressing and,

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.119
of course, he is a Sahaj Yogi,

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.999
but still not such a great Sahaj Yogi,

00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:24.780
I should say, because he started saying

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.340
that, “We have certain problems in our country.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.171
We have caste system

00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:31.420
and we have all these things – it’s a big problem.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.340
Like, in other countries

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.620
they have race problems and this, that and we have

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.980
also these problems

00:36:40.412 --> 00:36:44.309
within us that we talk of different castes.”

00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:48.660
So I said, “There is a solution for it.

00:36:49.197 --> 00:36:52.620
If you are reborn your complete birth is changed.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.340
You are no more English, no more American.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.980
You are no more an Indian to have a caste system:

00:36:58.181 --> 00:36:59.873
you are a Yogi,

00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:02.380
you are a realised-soul

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:04.179
and you have no caste,

00:37:04.451 --> 00:37:07.801
you have no religion, you have no race, you are beyond it.

00:37:10.226 --> 00:37:12.117
That’s what,” and he was surprised. I said,

00:37:12.318 --> 00:37:14.399
“That’s how you’ll solve the problem!”

00:37:15.955 --> 00:37:18.294
This human life

00:37:18.495 --> 00:37:20.049
is like that

00:37:20.696 --> 00:37:22.539
– it gives you identifications:

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.420
you are English,

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.940
you are rich, you are poor, you’re this, you are that,

00:37:28.594 --> 00:37:30.460
you are Indian.

00:37:32.138 --> 00:37:34.220
All sorts of identifications:

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.980
you are a king, you are a minister, minister’s son and

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.915
governor’s son and all those things.

00:37:41.116 --> 00:37:44.180
But once you become a Yogi you are a Yogi,

00:37:45.973 --> 00:37:48.553
because there is no unreal

00:37:48.753 --> 00:37:50.494
thing existing any more within us.

00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:54.315
These are all unreal identifications which just drop out.

00:37:55.042 --> 00:37:58.700
So many people in this country have taken to lives

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.660
which are alternate lives, as they call it,

00:38:01.951 --> 00:38:04.980
and also their dress is changed, everything changed,

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.197
but it’s all outside.

00:38:08.212 --> 00:38:11.205
And by that they felt that they have achieved

00:38:11.406 --> 00:38:12.813
a kind

00:38:13.014 --> 00:38:14.759
of a change within themselves,

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.740
but it’s not true,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.540
it’s not true.

00:38:20.155 --> 00:38:22.380
The unreal must drop out.

00:38:23.112 --> 00:38:26.100
The whole unreal must drop out. Once it drops out

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.020
then only you become the real personality.

00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:34.340
By changing outside, nothing changes

00:38:34.713 --> 00:38:36.740
and that has to happen

00:38:37.393 --> 00:38:38.926
to all of you,

00:38:39.426 --> 00:38:41.335
to all the seekers of the world.

00:38:41.539 --> 00:38:45.420
Sahaj Yoga is only meant for seekers and for nobody else.

00:38:46.676 --> 00:38:49.700
I am only interested among the true seekers

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.490
and not among other people who are seeking power,

00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:54.345
seeking this, seeking that.

00:38:54.546 --> 00:38:57.780
It’s all also artificial, absolutely artificial.

00:38:58.386 --> 00:39:00.340
About that, I’ll tell you later on

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.260
how these things are absolutely artificial.

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:05.615
May God bless you all!

00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:11.573
If you have any questions you may ask.

00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:47.297
Any questions?

00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:02.660
Are you all Sahaj Yogis?

00:40:05.549 --> 00:40:07.740
How many of you have come for the first time?

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.440
Raise your hands.

00:40:17.598 --> 00:40:19.420
Can you come forward,

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.499
all those who have come for the first time?

00:40:21.699 --> 00:40:24.140
Two lines you should have, occupy.

00:40:29.988 --> 00:40:31.468
You all should get up.

00:40:32.841 --> 00:40:35.079
Douglas, I think you all should get up.

00:40:35.279 --> 00:40:38.340
Please be seated there. You let them be seated.

00:40:41.297 --> 00:40:44.941
So now you can see how many are realised-souls sitting here

00:40:45.683 --> 00:40:48.080
and you have to just join their group, isn’t it?

00:40:48.261 --> 00:40:49.940
Please make yourself comfortable there.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.620
Now what about here?

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.940
Those who are Sahaj Yogis should go behind.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.993
Please come and join here.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.274
Lady: We can’t hear you at all.

00:41:04.474 --> 00:41:06.410
We couldn't hear you at all. We can’t hear you.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.260
Shri Mataji: Really? Is it so bad?

00:41:10.726 --> 00:41:12.269
Oh God!

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.029
What’s the problem?

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.734
Douglas,

00:41:16.515 --> 00:41:18.187
they couldn’t hear me?

00:41:19.107 --> 00:41:20.900
I’m sorry for that.

00:41:22.257 --> 00:41:24.740
Douglas: It’s coming through the loud speaker.

00:41:25.782 --> 00:41:27.358
Can you not hear in the back?

00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:30.304
Seekers: Yes, we could. Shri Mataji: You heard?

00:41:35.482 --> 00:41:39.377
Lady: We couldn’t hear you at all.
Shri Mataji: All right, let’s see what’s the reason. All right?

00:41:39.578 --> 00:41:41.510
Please make yourself comfortable.

00:41:44.781 --> 00:41:47.889
Ray? Let them there on the second seat would be better

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.296
all of them so we can look after them.

00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:04.460
You were feeling only the ego

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.105
or what?

00:42:08.093 --> 00:42:11.300
All right, that could be one of the tricks of Sahaj Yoga.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.617
All right, let’s see what happens.

00:42:14.628 --> 00:42:17.309
I also don’t hear many people

00:42:17.941 --> 00:42:21.641
clearly and unless and until you are a
realised-soul I find it very difficult to hear,

00:42:21.841 --> 00:42:24.340
so I have to ask somebody to tell me in my ears.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.805
The frequency doesn’t go into my ears, too!

00:42:27.005 --> 00:42:29.278
So let’s see what the problem is.

00:42:38.244 --> 00:42:40.220
Now close your eyes.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.460
Put your hands just like this, that’s all

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.900
and take out your shoes if possible.

00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:49.603
Now the whole thing, process takes

00:42:49.804 --> 00:42:52.860
hardly any time. It’s just a very short time:

00:42:53.794 --> 00:42:55.500
a split of a second.

00:42:55.807 --> 00:42:57.638
But if there are any

00:42:57.838 --> 00:42:59.932
barriers in between,

00:43:01.037 --> 00:43:03.020
then there could be a problem.

00:43:03.846 --> 00:43:06.420
So it takes a little more time, doesn’t matter:

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.230
to err is human, isn’t it?

00:43:10.785 --> 00:43:13.500
So it doesn’t matter. Whatever is the problem

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.417
it has to be worked out.

00:43:15.947 --> 00:43:18.268
When it doesn’t work out in you,

00:43:18.469 --> 00:43:21.420
some Sahaj Yogis will come round to help you.

00:43:22.676 --> 00:43:26.035
Now I must explain to you beforehand what happens.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:30.371
They have got this power flowing through

00:43:31.048 --> 00:43:32.550
their hands;

00:43:32.891 --> 00:43:36.507
and their fingers, as you see there,

00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:39.972
are decoding,

00:43:40.173 --> 00:43:42.941
giving messages, the fingers,

00:43:43.142 --> 00:43:46.599
about the centres where you have a problem.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.126
So they exactly know where the problem is.

00:43:50.412 --> 00:43:53.602
Also, they know how to cure that problem:

00:43:53.803 --> 00:43:55.724
so, they use their fingers,

00:43:56.239 --> 00:43:57.739
their hands.

00:43:58.049 --> 00:43:59.812
They won’t touch you,

00:44:00.881 --> 00:44:04.420
but they will know and they will try to correct you.

00:44:05.027 --> 00:44:06.987
So not to get frightened if they just

00:44:07.187 --> 00:44:09.980
come and raise your Kundalini or do something like that.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.820
There’s nothing to be frightened about.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.881
Nothing is going to happen to you.

00:44:14.082 --> 00:44:17.719
You are going to feel absolutely blissful and happy.

00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:20.506
You just don’t worry.

00:44:21.628 --> 00:44:23.131
All right.

00:44:24.325 --> 00:44:27.061
So put your, both the hands straight,

00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:29.361
just like this, and close your eyes.

00:44:29.749 --> 00:44:31.928
Now you need not stretch your body too much,

00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:34.220
nor you should slump it down.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.510
But sit comfortably with both the hands

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.669
on your lap or on your

00:44:41.644 --> 00:44:44.940
legs like this, on the thighs like this.

00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:51.780
And keep your eyes shut please.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.740
Please keep them shut.

00:44:55.972 --> 00:44:59.969
Whatever has to happen will happen inside;

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.670
nothing outside.

00:45:01.871 --> 00:45:04.834
There is no need to jump or to say something

00:45:05.034 --> 00:45:07.180
or to make a face or anything.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.207
Let it happen.

00:45:09.865 --> 00:45:12.978
Now there’s one more thing,

00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:17.092
one has to remember that it happens spontaneously

00:45:17.906 --> 00:45:21.339
and your attention should not be fixed on any point,

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.940
just leave your attention free.

00:45:25.106 --> 00:45:28.260
Even if you are thinking for example, doesn’t matter.

00:45:28.507 --> 00:45:30.620
there’s nothing to worry

00:45:31.156 --> 00:45:34.339
about it because this happens spontaneously,

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.595
your Kundalini rises

00:45:36.796 --> 00:45:40.380
and you get your Realisation spontaneously.

00:45:49.256 --> 00:45:51.739
So, don’t fix your attention anywhere.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.940
Just leave it loose, absolutely loose.

00:45:56.438 --> 00:45:58.420
Slowly you will find first of all

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.820
that you are not thinking.

00:46:07.412 --> 00:46:08.940
One thing,

00:46:09.289 --> 00:46:12.420
that you please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

00:46:12.649 --> 00:46:14.983
Because the Kundalini doesn’t rise

00:46:15.184 --> 00:46:17.630
above the Agyna chakra

00:46:17.831 --> 00:46:20.900
– or the chakra which is in the brain

00:46:21.132 --> 00:46:22.789
– if you open your eyes.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.054
Please keep your eyes shut.

00:46:51.959 --> 00:46:55.300
Now, the left hand of yours represents

00:46:55.541 --> 00:46:58.183
your desire and the right hand

00:46:58.384 --> 00:47:00.340
is your action.

00:47:00.931 --> 00:47:04.334
Now, I’ll tell you how to use your right hand

00:47:04.535 --> 00:47:06.300
while keeping your left hand

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.591
towards me on your lap.

00:47:09.785 --> 00:47:11.979
All the time you have to keep your left hand

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:14.288
with stretched fingers on your lap,

00:47:14.489 --> 00:47:17.380
while the right hand is to be used

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:21.108
on different centres.

00:47:22.364 --> 00:47:24.980
First of all, put the right hand

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.180
on your heart on the left hand side

00:47:32.459 --> 00:47:34.340
and in your heart,

00:47:35.742 --> 00:47:37.308
not loudly,

00:47:37.509 --> 00:47:40.002
you have to ask a question to me,

00:47:40.203 --> 00:47:43.740
saying, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.180
Ask this question thrice.

00:47:50.717 --> 00:47:53.660
Ask in any language, makes no difference.

00:47:55.947 --> 00:47:58.100
“Am I the Spirit?”

00:48:16.804 --> 00:48:19.146
Now, the quality of Spirit is

00:48:19.347 --> 00:48:22.300
that once the Spirit manifests in you,

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.700
you become your own master,

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.980
you become your own guru.

00:48:29.196 --> 00:48:31.340
So, please put the right hand

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.513
down on the stomach on the left hand side

00:48:33.713 --> 00:48:36.700
and just press it with your fingers, on the left hand side.

00:48:37.135 --> 00:48:40.420
Put your hand on the left hand side and press it with your finger,

00:48:40.902 --> 00:48:43.526
little bit lower, yes.

00:48:43.727 --> 00:48:46.980
Now here,

00:48:47.251 --> 00:48:48.789
ten times,

00:48:50.502 --> 00:48:52.020
you have to say,

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.580
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:41.393
Now raise this right hand to your heart again

00:49:44.945 --> 00:49:46.455
and say now,

00:49:46.655 --> 00:49:49.183
assertively, with full confidence,

00:49:49.406 --> 00:49:52.862
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

00:49:53.063 --> 00:49:54.709
Please say it twelve times.

00:49:54.909 --> 00:49:57.620
It is according to the number

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.660
of petals you have for your different centres.

00:50:03.445 --> 00:50:05.515
With full confidence, please say,

00:50:05.715 --> 00:50:07.780
“Mother I am the Spirit.”

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.179
“I am the Atma.”

00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:12.232
Twelve times.

00:50:51.626 --> 00:50:53.820
Now put the right hand

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:59.180
again on the left side of your neck.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.940
There’s a centre there, left side of your neck.

00:51:04.163 --> 00:51:08.113
Now, we have to know that the Spirit is

00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.900
without any blemish,

00:51:11.726 --> 00:51:14.859
without any guilt, nirdosh.

00:51:16.787 --> 00:51:18.861
So, we have to say at this point,

00:51:19.061 --> 00:51:22.465
“Mother I am not guilty. I am not at all guilty.”

00:51:22.666 --> 00:51:25.220
Forget about the past, forget it completely.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.577
You have to become a new life,

00:51:27.778 --> 00:51:31.339
so what do we say, “Mother I am not guilty.”

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.513
You have to say that sixteen times, please.

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:41.011
They have this problem,

00:51:41.212 --> 00:51:43.320
that’s why they couldn’t hear me.

00:51:43.521 --> 00:51:44.978
All right?

00:51:45.178 --> 00:51:47.275
That’s the problem you had:

00:51:47.475 --> 00:51:49.796
feeling guilty for nothing at all.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.900
Now say it with confidence,

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.943
“Mother I am not guilty.” Say that,

00:52:05.228 --> 00:52:06.744
sixteen times.

00:52:13.655 --> 00:52:16.020
Just a very strong one there.

00:52:33.324 --> 00:52:37.020
Now, raise this hand if you have said it,

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.740
to your forehead across.

00:52:42.698 --> 00:52:44.380
At this point

00:52:44.879 --> 00:52:47.403
you have to forgive everyone.

00:52:48.706 --> 00:52:51.017
You may say that it’s difficult,

00:52:52.884 --> 00:52:55.548
but when you do not forgive others

00:52:55.749 --> 00:52:58.949
you are playing into their hands and torturing yourself.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.860
Just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,”

00:53:03.999 --> 00:53:05.780
from your full heart,

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.620
sincerely.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.813
Please say, “Mother I forgive everyone.” Say it thrice.

00:53:12.329 --> 00:53:13.898
Put it across.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.585
Now, put this hand on top of your head,

00:53:29.785 --> 00:53:32.320
resting on the head in the centre.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.940
The palm of the hand should be in the centre

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:39.089
where it was a soft bone in your childhood: a little further.

00:53:39.378 --> 00:53:41.860
It’s not at the back side but further.

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.980
Here, it is going to break.

00:53:44.382 --> 00:53:46.466
Just put it a little further.

00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:48.900
Still some people are having...

00:53:50.123 --> 00:53:51.754
Just try to feel it.

00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:55.380
Just rub it a little bit with your hand.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.652
In a clockwise manner you can move it also.

00:53:57.852 --> 00:54:00.773
Just push the hand up on your head.

00:54:00.974 --> 00:54:02.681
Put the palm; don’t open your,

00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:05.181
push it hard, little bit.

00:54:05.382 --> 00:54:06.882
Now,

00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:11.180
at this point

00:54:12.014 --> 00:54:15.646
I can’t force you to become realised,

00:54:16.067 --> 00:54:19.187
it’s your freedom, so I respect it.

00:54:19.475 --> 00:54:21.018
You have to ask

00:54:21.218 --> 00:54:23.740
or you have to say, “Mother I want my Realisation.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.860
Please give me Realisation,”

00:54:26.483 --> 00:54:28.260
seven times, please.

00:54:54.169 --> 00:54:57.481
Now, raise your hand and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

00:54:57.785 --> 00:54:59.580
You can change your hand also

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.531
and see with the other hand.

00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:04.620
Put the right hand down and with the left hand you can see

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.220
if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

00:55:08.489 --> 00:55:11.180
You have to certify yourself first of all.

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.675
On top of your head, about four inches

00:55:14.875 --> 00:55:18.282
on top of your head, above.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.620
Just try to see if you are feeling any cool breeze coming out.

00:55:23.118 --> 00:55:24.900
It’s very subtle.

00:55:25.248 --> 00:55:28.405
You can change your hands and see.

00:55:34.817 --> 00:55:36.419
It’s very, very subtle

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:40.085
and as we are going from gross level to subtle level

00:55:40.285 --> 00:55:42.351
our sensitivity is not so great.

00:55:42.552 --> 00:55:44.117
If you are feeling it

00:55:44.317 --> 00:55:47.417
then you can put down your hands, both the hands.

00:55:55.562 --> 00:55:58.460
First you must feel it on top of your head

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:02.093
and if you don’t feel it

00:56:02.636 --> 00:56:04.367
then later on

00:56:04.606 --> 00:56:06.092
we’ll see how it works out.

00:56:06.293 --> 00:56:07.980
But those who are feeling it will

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.537
start feeling it later on, on their hands.

00:56:16.744 --> 00:56:18.647
You can change over.

00:57:34.241 --> 00:57:36.939
Can some of the Sahaj Yogis see the people

00:57:37.261 --> 00:57:38.775
who have come for the first time?

00:57:38.976 --> 00:57:41.180
You can put down your hands on the seat,

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.920
but don’t open your eyes still.

00:57:43.121 --> 00:57:45.300
Keep both the hands straight. It has to work out.

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.434
It will work out, don’t you worry.

00:57:47.635 --> 00:57:50.886
Can some of you come in from the front line, please?

00:58:00.338 --> 00:58:03.106
Bala, just see your neighbour. Has she felt it?

00:58:03.781 --> 00:58:06.357
Can you come in front?

00:58:11.072 --> 00:58:12.787
Facing them you can.

00:58:12.988 --> 00:58:16.815
Alan, you can come facing them and some people can go behind.
