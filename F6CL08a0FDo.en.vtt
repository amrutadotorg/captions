WEBVTT

00:47.585 --> 00:50.940
﻿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:51.467 --> 00:54.780
We are seeking truth, reality,

00:55.190 --> 00:57.161
not hallucinations,

00:57.630 --> 00:59.500
not imagination,

00:59.981 --> 01:02.403
not our own mental projections.

01:03.309 --> 01:05.689
We have not being yet able,

01:05.955 --> 01:08.860
many of us who are seeking, understand

01:09.106 --> 01:11.739
that reality is what it is.

01:11.940 --> 01:15.662
It will be the same. It has been the same.

01:16.046 --> 01:17.736
We cannot

01:18.625 --> 01:20.444
coin it for ourselves.

01:21.544 --> 01:23.656
We cannot organise it,

01:24.117 --> 01:26.580
and we cannot think about it.

01:26.780 --> 01:29.762
We cannot put a mental projection of our own

01:29.980 --> 01:33.215
as to, “This is the reality and this is not the reality.”

01:34.275 --> 01:36.105
Today only I was reading

01:36.306 --> 01:37.978
with great surprise an article

01:38.178 --> 01:40.740
about sniffing the glue that people are doing.

01:40.940 --> 01:43.140
I mean, now this is the last they are sniffing now,

01:43.340 --> 01:45.540
and then petrol, all sorts of things.

01:46.030 --> 01:48.460
Well, why? Why are they doing it?

01:50.224 --> 01:52.340
Because for some sensation.

01:53.690 --> 01:57.690
But they said that when you do that, what happens

01:58.151 --> 02:00.026
that you start believing

02:00.226 --> 02:03.249
that whatever you are doing is right.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.180
That exactly is the point today.

02:07.380 --> 02:10.460
Without sniffing also there are many who believe like that,

02:11.364 --> 02:14.893
that whatever their ideas are about God

02:15.093 --> 02:17.660
or about Spirit, about seeking,

02:18.150 --> 02:20.075
is the right thing

02:20.276 --> 02:23.843
and they don’t want to see what reality is.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.517
They just want to

02:31.332 --> 02:34.700
project their ego,

02:34.956 --> 02:36.980
their imagination,

02:37.236 --> 02:39.900
to believe that this is the reality,

02:40.500 --> 02:42.858
and then they just

02:43.059 --> 02:46.580
are convinced that they know everything.

02:46.780 --> 02:49.020
With such people,

02:50.737 --> 02:53.873
what to do? How to tell them

02:54.220 --> 02:57.420
that reality is something very different?

03:00.547 --> 03:04.295
Now what happens when we put our mental projections like this?

03:04.496 --> 03:08.460
We conceive things, we read books, we form our own ideas.

03:09.715 --> 03:13.104
It’s a very dangerous thing that can happen to human beings:

03:13.448 --> 03:15.068
and that is

03:15.742 --> 03:17.820
your ego starts bloating,

03:18.694 --> 03:21.740
becoming big and big and big without your knowledge.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.960
A person who has an ego

03:25.592 --> 03:29.004
does not harm himself at all. He harms others.

03:30.152 --> 03:32.358
He doesn’t harm anyone

03:33.083 --> 03:36.065
as such but he harms in a way

03:36.265 --> 03:39.688
which can be very deep hurting.

03:42.079 --> 03:45.054
He’ll say things which will hurt a person.

03:45.256 --> 03:47.483
He’ll do things that will hurt.

03:47.699 --> 03:50.902
Nations after nations can be destroyed with this ego,

03:51.103 --> 03:52.768
like Hitler did.

03:54.137 --> 03:57.100
So when you put your mental projections like this, “I can do it.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.660
I can find it. I know. I know. I believe,”

04:01.433 --> 04:03.220
then this ego, you see,

04:03.420 --> 04:05.660
grows in your head.

04:06.009 --> 04:09.135
If it was only your head nothing to bother,

04:09.870 --> 04:13.005
but it grows round your heart,

04:13.927 --> 04:16.380
it grows round your heart

04:17.672 --> 04:21.016
and your heart becomes like a stone.

04:22.391 --> 04:24.496
You cannot feel

04:26.410 --> 04:28.437
anything that is real.

04:28.638 --> 04:32.410
You cannot understand what is real and what is unreal.

04:32.611 --> 04:36.024
All his discrimination is lost completely.

04:38.446 --> 04:42.009
I went to Bangalore and there were some

04:42.258 --> 04:46.258
very ordinary people working in gardens and things like that.

04:47.235 --> 04:48.840
They saw me

04:50.104 --> 04:53.405
and they recognised, not difficult.

04:53.606 --> 04:55.141
One lady came and told me,

04:55.341 --> 04:57.829
“My son has gone away for two years.

04:58.029 --> 05:01.461
He was only fourteen; now he must be sixteen

05:02.335 --> 05:05.950
and I know you can call him back.” I said, “How do you know?”

05:06.151 --> 05:07.780
She said, “We know who you are.”

05:07.980 --> 05:10.452
Just seeing my face, can you imagine?

05:10.653 --> 05:12.942
Such sensitivity they had.

05:13.957 --> 05:17.816
I said, “All right,” and the boy came back after two days.

05:18.624 --> 05:20.560
But look at their quality.

05:20.761 --> 05:24.440
The whole level of sensitivity is lost with this ego.

05:25.728 --> 05:27.900
When Rama went to jungle

05:28.100 --> 05:29.900
– as you know he was sent away

05:30.100 --> 05:32.710
– everyone recognised them, who were in the jungle

05:32.910 --> 05:35.120
leading a very normal life.

05:37.079 --> 05:39.724
But today it’s getting worse and worse and worse.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.063
We have no eyes to see.

05:42.462 --> 05:44.672
We have no sensitivity to understand.

05:46.533 --> 05:48.373
We have our own images

05:48.573 --> 05:50.860
built around us; such barriers.

05:51.303 --> 05:54.245
We have lost all sensitivity to reality,

05:54.446 --> 05:56.620
to goodness, to Divinity, to love,

05:56.820 --> 05:58.917
to affection, to compassion,

06:03.609 --> 06:07.052
and that’s why it is so difficult, it’s very difficult.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.082
Even when we say we are seeking reality,

06:10.282 --> 06:12.023
it’s kind of a big

06:12.555 --> 06:15.254
announcement of the ego.

06:15.918 --> 06:19.524
But there are many who do believe
we have found the reality, we know reality,

06:19.724 --> 06:22.990
we have full conception of reality and this is what it is.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.620
If, suppose, tomorrow Christ comes,

06:28.820 --> 06:30.860
who is going to recognise Him?

06:31.968 --> 06:33.478
Not you.

06:33.679 --> 06:37.505
Not the people who are living in the cities, not them.

06:37.706 --> 06:40.074
But when He goes

06:40.275 --> 06:44.219
in the forests to simple village people they will,

06:45.396 --> 06:47.540
because they haven’t lost that,

06:48.328 --> 06:50.740
they are still there in the centre.

06:52.950 --> 06:56.399
This ego develops with so many things:

06:57.475 --> 06:59.707
money, one thing.

07:00.036 --> 07:03.739
Sometimes the belief that we are moneyed people also can.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.715
Power,

07:06.915 --> 07:10.672
I mean, as soon as somebody becomes a
minister you should say he is completely changed:

07:10.873 --> 07:13.820
his face is changed, his style is changed, his talking is changed.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.220
They have forgotten what life is like.

07:16.420 --> 07:19.412
There’s no fun in their life, no fun at all,

07:20.912 --> 07:23.138
just like dried fishes.

07:23.339 --> 07:26.917
Better not go near them, otherwise you will get the stink of their

07:27.265 --> 07:28.766
ego!

07:31.089 --> 07:34.527
This is what is the problem today, the present day.

07:35.571 --> 07:38.302
Sahaj Yogis get upset about it.

07:38.503 --> 07:40.900
“Why, Mother, people don’t

07:41.304 --> 07:43.313
progress in Sahaj Yoga?”

07:45.290 --> 07:47.759
First they have their own conception.

07:49.389 --> 07:51.513
You tell them, “This is Sahaja Yoga,”

07:52.388 --> 07:54.893
and as you have to tell somebody this is reality

07:55.093 --> 07:56.767
– say you say this is diamond

07:56.968 --> 08:00.860
– then you have to also remove all the obstructions which are

08:01.060 --> 08:04.326
on top of that to show you that this is reality.

08:05.390 --> 08:07.462
The wisdom lies in understanding:

08:07.662 --> 08:09.631
“What it is let’s see for ourselves.”

08:10.522 --> 08:12.985
That’s the soundness of a character, if you have,

08:13.185 --> 08:15.260
at least you will settle down

08:15.460 --> 08:17.544
and try to see what it is.

08:17.745 --> 08:21.439
Instead of that people just get angry. “Oh we don’t believe it!”

08:21.860 --> 08:24.100
But you don’t believe with what?

08:25.482 --> 08:27.555
You haven’t got the sensitivity

08:27.756 --> 08:30.860
to know what to believe, what not to believe.

08:33.611 --> 08:36.592
But it is even much more dangerous than that

08:37.975 --> 08:41.592
because when you have to seek,

08:41.958 --> 08:43.544
because that’s your nature.

08:43.745 --> 08:47.246
You have been seeking all your lives, not this life.

08:47.447 --> 08:48.860
And when you come

08:49.060 --> 08:52.540
again to seek in this life which is a special time,

08:52.740 --> 08:56.420
you are always enamoured by something that is unreal,

08:57.324 --> 09:00.087
that appeals to your ego or to your superego:

09:00.287 --> 09:02.980
means a person, if he can somehow or other

09:03.180 --> 09:05.540
give you some sort of a sensation

09:05.991 --> 09:08.260
or some sort of mesmerism,

09:08.460 --> 09:12.460
you think, “Oh, this is wonderful! I felt so happy. I was very high!”

09:12.997 --> 09:15.500
Just like getting intoxicated.

09:16.231 --> 09:19.334
But what have you achieved? Is the point, by that.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.757
Like if you take some sort of this

09:21.957 --> 09:23.859
glue business, I don’t know what happens.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.680
Today, somehow, I have been reading

09:25.880 --> 09:27.736
three articles on such things.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.740
Something like cocaine they said is the modern trouble now.

09:31.940 --> 09:34.405
The drugs are out, now the cocaine.

09:35.615 --> 09:37.656
With all of this intelligence,

09:38.015 --> 09:39.580
with all this

09:39.964 --> 09:41.980
knowledge that you have gathered,

09:42.221 --> 09:45.851
if you have to end up your life with cocaine and glue,

09:46.806 --> 09:48.746
where is the wisdom?

09:50.158 --> 09:51.980
When you have to

09:52.180 --> 09:54.620
select something for your life,

09:55.254 --> 09:57.267
for the fun of your life,

09:57.468 --> 09:59.604
for the beauty of your life,

10:00.207 --> 10:01.707
what do you select?

10:01.908 --> 10:03.715
Something that is going to destroy you?

10:03.915 --> 10:06.460
You see others are destroyed:

10:07.121 --> 10:08.685
still you go to it.

10:10.912 --> 10:13.091
This is the danger of this horrible

10:13.291 --> 10:15.700
ego which we have created of our own.

10:16.114 --> 10:18.408
But it may also take you to people

10:18.609 --> 10:21.100
who will pamper your ego. For example, somebody says,

10:21.300 --> 10:24.765
“All right, in this hall if you have to come, pay hundred pounds,

10:24.965 --> 10:26.608
otherwise, you cannot enter.”

10:26.819 --> 10:29.159
You’ll be surprised this hall will be filled completely,

10:29.359 --> 10:31.880
by all the big, big cars will be standing here,

10:32.080 --> 10:34.031
and people will be just sitting here,

10:34.232 --> 10:36.943
as if they are going to races:

10:37.201 --> 10:39.991
who pays more is the competition.

10:41.572 --> 10:43.619
In the elite society, you will be surprised,

10:43.820 --> 10:46.125
the talk is like this, “Who is your guru?”

10:47.119 --> 10:49.580
“What are you going to do this time?”

10:49.780 --> 10:51.893
They said, “I have tried this. I have paid

10:52.093 --> 10:54.300
about five thousand pounds.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.061
Now I think I’ll have to go somewhere with ten thousand pounds.”

10:58.280 --> 11:02.100
It's really, that’s the talk they have and they talk like that.

11:05.341 --> 11:09.181
If it was only stupidity that you achieved through your ego,

11:09.381 --> 11:11.911
it’s not so dangerous.

11:12.450 --> 11:14.907
But discrimination

11:15.108 --> 11:17.020
is completely lost

11:17.220 --> 11:19.900
and always you are enamoured

11:20.100 --> 11:22.220
more by unreal things,

11:26.872 --> 11:28.872
and with little understanding,

11:29.073 --> 11:31.740
with little intelligence you can understand.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.510
Very little is needed.

11:33.711 --> 11:36.731
You don’t have to read books to understand that,

11:37.035 --> 11:39.035
but that simple common sense

11:39.236 --> 11:41.236
of a village folk you don’t have.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.700
Like, I remember my

11:45.900 --> 11:47.559
granddaughter once

11:47.760 --> 11:50.134
went with her father and mother

11:50.634 --> 11:53.806
to a lama. She is a realised soul

11:54.006 --> 11:55.802
– the parents are not

11:56.362 --> 11:59.299
– and this lama had shaved his head completely

11:59.647 --> 12:01.580
and was sitting with a big

12:03.625 --> 12:05.125
robe.

12:06.498 --> 12:07.998
So, first

12:08.434 --> 12:10.771
everybody was going. She was looking at him.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.483
She couldn’t understand what this fellow is up to because

12:13.683 --> 12:15.581
everybody was touching his feet,

12:16.265 --> 12:18.259
and then the father went and

12:18.459 --> 12:21.475
touched his feet and when the mother
went and touched his feet she couldn’t bear it.

12:21.676 --> 12:25.741
She was only five years of age. She just put back
her hands like this and stood before him, she said,

12:25.942 --> 12:28.486
“Why are you such a hypocrite?

12:28.714 --> 12:30.445
You are not a realised-soul.

12:30.646 --> 12:33.581
Just by shaving your head and by wearing this dress

12:33.781 --> 12:35.940
do you become a realised-soul?”

12:38.180 --> 12:40.221
She just stood before him – a five-year-old child!

12:40.421 --> 12:42.460
And the parents were rather embarrassed.

12:43.733 --> 12:45.910
And the fellow didn’t know where to look when she said

12:46.110 --> 12:48.700
– in Hindi they say ‘paar’ – “You are not even paar.

12:48.900 --> 12:52.123
How are you sitting there and
asking everybody to touch your feet?

12:52.323 --> 12:53.818
What right have you?”

12:54.019 --> 12:57.018
And then the parents got embarrassed and said, “You shouldn’t say like that.”

12:57.219 --> 12:59.986
She said, “I would not have said if you had not touched his feet.”

13:01.800 --> 13:03.318
See, the five-year-old child!

13:03.565 --> 13:07.116
And otherwise she is a very mild, sweet person. She stood up.

13:10.732 --> 13:13.789
But somebody comes as la-ma – finished!

13:15.634 --> 13:19.221
If somebody is coming here lama for us, he is the greatest.

13:19.698 --> 13:23.698
Then he tells us that, “You have to go to Shambala

13:24.700 --> 13:26.203
in the Gobi Desert!”

13:26.403 --> 13:29.700
We are all packing our things, going to Gobi Desert to die there.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.700
What else? Is there any Nirvana written

13:32.900 --> 13:34.700
that Gobi desert?

13:36.885 --> 13:40.711
This is what is happening to the seekers

13:41.008 --> 13:43.980
who have been seeking for ages and ages

13:44.180 --> 13:46.220
and they have come

13:47.429 --> 13:50.461
on this earth deliberately

13:50.889 --> 13:52.579
to get their Realisation.

13:52.780 --> 13:55.620
And there they are ending up their lives

13:55.820 --> 13:57.854
in Gobi Desert!

13:59.971 --> 14:02.440
But if anybody tells them,

14:02.640 --> 14:05.854
“That’s not the thing. That’s not the reality,”

14:06.054 --> 14:09.090
then they get very angry. “Why should you criticise?”

14:13.065 --> 14:14.755
But the main thing is:

14:15.495 --> 14:18.300
you have to find it for yourself.

14:20.744 --> 14:22.994
You have to understand that

14:23.194 --> 14:26.627
the power has to work through you.

14:28.945 --> 14:31.940
Just like blind we see going under a cover.

14:32.140 --> 14:35.817
If somebody says, “Three thousand pounds.”
“All right.” Then, “Six thousand pounds,” “All right”,

14:36.017 --> 14:39.185
then, “Ten thousand pounds,” “All right.” And just walking

14:39.385 --> 14:41.276
towards the hell.

14:41.973 --> 14:43.558
That’s what it is.

14:44.761 --> 14:46.860
You can’t pay for God.

14:48.701 --> 14:50.280
You can’t pay.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.660
You can’t read about Him.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.430
You have to experience.

14:58.938 --> 15:01.133
And the experience when it is yours,

15:01.333 --> 15:03.306
you become part and parcel

15:03.507 --> 15:05.190
of God Almighty.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.783
You become the power.

15:11.507 --> 15:14.460
Perhaps very few human beings realise

15:14.660 --> 15:16.493
how delicately,

15:16.693 --> 15:18.281
beautifully,

15:18.482 --> 15:21.300
for so many ages God has worked

15:21.500 --> 15:24.334
on human beings to create you, today.

15:24.535 --> 15:27.632
And the seekers are a special category of people.

15:30.831 --> 15:34.437
But modern times are the worst times and the best times

15:36.025 --> 15:39.730
because all kinds of negative forces are working now.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.300
First they have built up your ego

15:44.500 --> 15:46.780
and now this ego is fed by people

15:46.980 --> 15:49.020
who are utilising you.

15:50.948 --> 15:52.947
And after that

15:53.948 --> 15:55.503
you have lost

15:55.752 --> 15:57.340
even the concept,

15:57.540 --> 16:00.472
the idea, as to what to find.

16:02.114 --> 16:05.260
This is the situation of today’s seekers.

16:09.928 --> 16:13.708
England is doing well now: I’m very happy about it.

16:14.744 --> 16:16.619
I had to work hard

16:16.915 --> 16:20.790
but English are still sound people.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.820
They have been able to see through

16:24.216 --> 16:26.420
the truth of Sahaj Yoga.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.940
They have been able to absorb.

16:30.219 --> 16:33.670
But when you say, I have to go to America, I shudder;

16:34.099 --> 16:36.079
I really tell you, I shudder.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.050
Because they have become so shallow now,

16:40.251 --> 16:43.190
with all these gurus going there and all kinds of ideas

16:43.391 --> 16:45.538
that they have, even witchcraft.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.021
I mean they have accepted all that is wrong.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.507
One can understand indiscretion,

16:51.707 --> 16:53.898
but discretion only

16:54.441 --> 16:58.433
going towards all that is wrong, all that is anti-God,

16:58.634 --> 17:00.813
all that is anti-life,

17:02.943 --> 17:04.445
is some sort of a

17:04.645 --> 17:08.274
negative attraction or fraternity. I don’t know what to call it.

17:10.223 --> 17:13.334
While the mental projections are so built-up

17:14.360 --> 17:16.420
that’s it’s a very big barrier.

17:17.941 --> 17:20.396
Now, how do we break that in Sahaja Yoga?

17:20.597 --> 17:23.566
We should try to understand how we break

17:23.766 --> 17:26.838
these ego and superego barriers within human beings.

17:27.203 --> 17:30.884
Not by lecturing you – it cannot work out through lectures.

17:31.085 --> 17:34.660
Not by any kind of brainwashing or anything.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.481
We can at the most prepare you

17:37.681 --> 17:39.353
to open your mind, that’s all.

17:39.553 --> 17:42.900
But one has to understand

17:43.100 --> 17:46.140
that human awareness is not yet complete.

17:46.849 --> 17:49.325
Through our human awareness

17:49.526 --> 17:52.295
we cannot understand God,

17:55.091 --> 17:57.050
only through our spirit.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.203
We have to become the Spirit.

17:59.404 --> 18:02.333
Every gospel, every scripture,

18:02.534 --> 18:04.227
every religion has said,

18:04.427 --> 18:07.620
“You have to be the Spirit.”

18:09.118 --> 18:12.629
That means anybody can say, “Now we have become Spiritualists,

18:12.990 --> 18:14.523
or we have become spirits.”

18:14.723 --> 18:17.740
This is another identification one can have.

18:18.238 --> 18:20.398
You have to become Spirit, means the

18:20.598 --> 18:23.740
quality of Spirit must manifest through you:

18:25.305 --> 18:26.980
through your attention,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.060
through your awareness

18:29.261 --> 18:31.420
and through your personality.

18:32.590 --> 18:36.214
If it is not happening you cannot just brand yourself, like,

18:36.422 --> 18:39.183
I can say, “I am a Catholic,” or,

18:39.383 --> 18:41.900
“I am a Hindu or a Muslim.” It’s not like that.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.060
You cannot just put a label to a person saying that, “Now,

18:45.321 --> 18:48.918
I am a person who is a self-realised person.”

18:51.304 --> 18:54.660
It is your being which has to express that.

18:55.541 --> 18:57.860
You have to become,

19:00.225 --> 19:03.820
just by accepting mentally that, “I am such and such!”

19:04.020 --> 19:06.765
I mean, they play all kinds of tricks. They’ll give you a name:

19:06.965 --> 19:09.580
Shivanand and Dayanand and all sorts of

19:09.780 --> 19:11.860
Bhonganand, as we call them.

19:12.294 --> 19:14.391
And they go on the streets and say,

19:14.591 --> 19:17.281
“Oh, I am such and such. My name is such and such.”

19:17.948 --> 19:21.940
I mean, even if you call yourself ‘donkey’ you don’t become a donkey.

19:23.348 --> 19:25.194
Then how can you become a realised-soul

19:25.394 --> 19:27.260
if you call yourself a realised-soul?

19:27.914 --> 19:29.619
You are what you are,

19:29.820 --> 19:32.093
but you have to become. And that becoming

19:32.293 --> 19:35.813
is a living process of a living God.

19:37.645 --> 19:40.233
It’s not a process where you start jumping, dancing.

19:40.434 --> 19:41.949
No, it is not.

19:42.359 --> 19:44.691
It’s a living process

19:45.023 --> 19:48.357
and we cannot do living processes.

19:49.045 --> 19:50.917
It’s done by nature:

19:51.190 --> 19:53.358
spontaneously, sahaja,

19:54.075 --> 19:55.600
by God.

19:56.389 --> 19:58.500
So the process of Realisation

19:58.700 --> 20:01.540
is the awakening of the Kundalini

20:01.740 --> 20:04.260
which lies in the triangular bone.

20:04.460 --> 20:05.889
We haven’t go here.

20:06.090 --> 20:08.036
Can you come and show them, someone?

20:10.092 --> 20:12.260
In the triangular bone you see this,

20:12.460 --> 20:14.940
lying in three and a half

20:15.686 --> 20:17.186
coils.

20:21.121 --> 20:23.140
This is the energy that

20:23.340 --> 20:25.726
is resting in the triangular bone

20:25.927 --> 20:28.020
called as Sacrum.

20:28.995 --> 20:32.580
Greeks knew it was a sacred bone; so, they called it Sacrum.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.180
When I asked them they said they had a rapport

20:36.380 --> 20:38.183
with Indians long, long time back,

20:38.383 --> 20:41.420
and they discovered that this is a sacred bone.

20:42.848 --> 20:45.780
This sacred bone lies within you

20:46.208 --> 20:49.147
and the sacred energy also lies within you

20:49.598 --> 20:51.180
unharmed,

20:51.873 --> 20:54.570
absolutely waiting there.

20:55.436 --> 20:57.536
Now this is the energy

20:57.880 --> 21:01.136
of your pure desire.

21:03.844 --> 21:07.856
I don’t know if we have any idea of purity left in the modern times.

21:09.150 --> 21:11.341
You eat anything, it is contaminated.

21:11.541 --> 21:13.980
You smoke something in the air,

21:14.180 --> 21:15.820
so, you contaminate everything.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.045
You hear music which is contaminated.

21:18.245 --> 21:20.222
Everything is contaminated.

21:20.791 --> 21:24.197
So, the sense of purity is only existing in that

21:24.397 --> 21:26.660
power of ours which is a pure desire,

21:26.860 --> 21:28.420
not a perverted desire

21:28.620 --> 21:31.180
or not a spoiled desire, or mixed-up desire,

21:31.380 --> 21:35.095
but a pure desire to be one with the Divine:

21:36.125 --> 21:39.534
to be in the Yoga, to be united

21:39.735 --> 21:43.446
with the Divine Power that is all-pervading,

21:44.360 --> 21:46.694
the power of love of God.

21:47.184 --> 21:49.820
That’s the purest desire we have

21:50.020 --> 21:52.940
because all other desires have no meaning.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.820
Whatever desires we have otherwise,

21:57.693 --> 22:00.316
you know, never give us satisfaction.

22:01.365 --> 22:03.132
We jump from one to another.

22:03.333 --> 22:06.945
But once this pure absolute desire rises within us

22:07.145 --> 22:09.890
– it should rise – as an energy,

22:11.330 --> 22:14.275
then we have no other desire.

22:15.425 --> 22:17.420
Then the whole situation changes.

22:17.620 --> 22:20.980
When you are facing me you are desireless,

22:21.180 --> 22:24.500
but then you come and sit with me and watch others.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.500
The whole situation changes.

22:26.864 --> 22:28.608
You become

22:29.685 --> 22:31.195
self-realised.

22:31.396 --> 22:33.900
When this desire awakens within you,

22:34.100 --> 22:36.540
passes through six centres

22:36.836 --> 22:38.660
crosses through this centre,

22:38.927 --> 22:42.567
then you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head.

22:42.768 --> 22:44.643
Now, this nobody can do.

22:44.843 --> 22:46.810
Can anybody do like that?

22:47.011 --> 22:49.943
All these gurus make you jump, pay them money.

22:50.143 --> 22:52.580
Tell them, “We’ll give you a thousand pounds

22:52.780 --> 22:56.156
if you can really put the cool breeze out of our heads!”

22:56.357 --> 22:59.180
Or even ten thousand pounds if they want!

22:59.380 --> 23:03.145
Even millions and billions of pounds they cannot do it,

23:05.643 --> 23:07.643
because they are not authorised.

23:12.263 --> 23:13.780
So this is what it is:

23:13.980 --> 23:17.343
that we have to ask for reality

23:17.694 --> 23:20.342
– the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

23:22.372 --> 23:25.420
This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us,

23:26.434 --> 23:29.330
and that we have to feel on top of our head,

23:29.531 --> 23:32.422
and then in our fingers it should flow.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.418
Then we should say

23:35.618 --> 23:37.916
that the Spirit has come into our attention,

23:38.116 --> 23:41.744
into our central nervous system because we are feeling it now.

23:42.352 --> 23:44.888
That’s how we have to believe in it.

23:45.686 --> 23:48.585
But that’s not sufficient. That’s not the end of it, as you know,

23:48.785 --> 23:51.877
so many of you: you have to work it out.

23:52.586 --> 23:54.846
Now why this working is needed?

23:56.860 --> 23:59.500
Because there are lots of impurities.

24:00.888 --> 24:04.314
Not to feel guilty about it – whatever has happened has happened

24:04.514 --> 24:06.260
– but there are impurities.

24:06.953 --> 24:08.900
This is your rebirth.

24:09.178 --> 24:11.878
When the bird comes out of the egg, the little bit of egg is

24:12.078 --> 24:14.700
still sticking on to him so he has to clean that bit off.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.660
And then you become a different personality altogether.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.463
Then the reality can be understood because

24:22.663 --> 24:24.828
you are that which can see the reality:

24:25.029 --> 24:26.629
you have become the Spirit.

24:26.830 --> 24:30.660
Without becoming the Spirit you cannot see the reality.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.863
You cannot understand the reality.

24:33.064 --> 24:34.901
Before that, as I said,

24:35.101 --> 24:37.812
it is your own mental projection,

24:38.461 --> 24:42.463
it’s your own hallucination, imagination.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.940
The entire concept

24:47.430 --> 24:49.180
is a myth.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.380
You will discover that very soon when you become that.

24:53.654 --> 24:55.868
But what’s the harm in becoming that?

24:56.069 --> 24:58.622
Because for that you have been seeking.

24:59.837 --> 25:02.060
And that is what

25:03.363 --> 25:06.366
one should understand that,

25:06.851 --> 25:08.851
“I have to become.

25:09.757 --> 25:12.220
I have to become that special being.

25:12.937 --> 25:15.060
I have to be the Spirit.

25:16.346 --> 25:18.380
I have to be the instrument

25:18.580 --> 25:20.346
of that Divine Power.

25:21.092 --> 25:24.948
I have to understand all the working of that Divine Power.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.680
I have to purify myself.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.727
I have to cleanse myself through that Divine Power.”

25:32.379 --> 25:33.900
Some people ask me,

25:34.100 --> 25:37.260
“Mother, it’s very difficult to awaken the Kundalini?”

25:37.460 --> 25:39.700
I said, “Maybe for some; not for me!”

25:40.001 --> 25:42.025
It’s true, it’s not for me.

25:43.143 --> 25:45.640
But why not for me? That, I don’t want to tell.

25:45.841 --> 25:47.596
That, you have to find out for yourself.

25:48.052 --> 25:49.549
But it’s true.

25:50.933 --> 25:53.194
It is easy for me, no doubt,

25:53.401 --> 25:55.537
and it will be easy for you also

25:55.737 --> 25:57.401
– you will be surprised.

26:02.579 --> 26:05.340
Actually, Sahaj Yogis are very humble people:

26:05.602 --> 26:08.002
you have no idea how humble they are.

26:08.618 --> 26:10.167
The other day

26:10.420 --> 26:13.516
they had somebody in Bombay who came to see me

26:13.886 --> 26:15.758
and he told me, “Mother,

26:15.959 --> 26:19.113
there’s one guru,” who is a real guru, I should say.

26:19.562 --> 26:21.781
“I have been with him for fourteen years,

26:21.982 --> 26:25.485
and he has been making me do this and do that,” – fourteen years!

26:26.012 --> 26:29.180
– “and one day I came to a programme, I got my Realisation

26:29.425 --> 26:32.380
and now I can give Realisation to others.

26:33.685 --> 26:36.337
So I went and saw my guru and I told him,

26:37.757 --> 26:39.300
that, ‘How is it

26:39.900 --> 26:41.700
that you recognise Mother?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.940
You know about Her. You talk about Her,

26:44.141 --> 26:46.595
and you took fourteen years just to cleanse me and

26:46.795 --> 26:50.780
I haven’t got my Realisation? Now, here I can give Realisation.’

26:53.293 --> 26:56.644
”So he said, “Better not talk about it.

26:57.199 --> 27:00.083
Now you better give Realisations to others, I can’t.

27:01.628 --> 27:03.288
You are specially blessed.”

27:03.489 --> 27:05.089
– it’s a fact.

27:05.681 --> 27:07.820
But Sahaj Yogis are so simple,

27:08.020 --> 27:10.260
so humble,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.860
they are better than all these gurus put together,

27:14.111 --> 27:16.020
but they won’t that.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.940
They have become,

27:18.140 --> 27:21.811
and all of you who are here for the first time or second time,

27:22.012 --> 27:23.540
all of you have to become.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.140
But you have to have patience with yourself.

27:26.826 --> 27:29.912
We have patience, we have love, compassion, everything,

27:30.113 --> 27:32.312
but you must have love for yourself

27:32.513 --> 27:34.084
and awareness that

27:34.284 --> 27:36.673
you are not an ordinary person.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.820
You are a seeker, a special category of a person.

27:42.537 --> 27:45.100
We can’t work on mediocres.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.660
You are men of God

27:48.860 --> 27:52.100
as described by William Blake. You are that.

27:52.746 --> 27:55.980
Now, if you want to waste your life with sniffing that glue,

27:56.257 --> 27:58.057
what are we to do?

28:01.173 --> 28:04.552
Or you want to pay some sort of a

28:05.332 --> 28:08.300
fraud personality,

28:08.500 --> 28:10.002
what are we to do?

28:12.460 --> 28:14.109
Except that

28:15.101 --> 28:16.820
we can only

28:20.295 --> 28:21.869
pray for you

28:22.184 --> 28:25.980
that you should come back to right path and get your

28:26.180 --> 28:29.300
wisdom back so that you get your Realisation.

28:30.212 --> 28:34.212
That’s the only thing we have to do is to give you Realisation

28:34.776 --> 28:38.420
so that you also know how to give Realisations to others.

28:39.895 --> 28:42.900
There are so many myths working: like, one lady told me,

28:43.100 --> 28:45.700
“Nobody can do anything for anyone.”

28:46.056 --> 28:47.605
But why not?

28:50.245 --> 28:54.091
If by getting Realisation you become what you have to become,

28:54.291 --> 28:56.500
why not? Why have these

28:56.700 --> 28:59.209
barriers before give these explanations

28:59.409 --> 29:00.972
beforehand?

29:02.097 --> 29:04.998
Like, you tell somebody, “All right,

29:05.198 --> 29:07.620
now tomorrow we would like to buy,

29:07.820 --> 29:09.780
say, a particular

29:10.105 --> 29:11.865
type of a thing.”

29:12.869 --> 29:15.932
So, the person should say,
“All right, let’s go and find out,” normally,

29:16.140 --> 29:17.820
“Let’s go and find out if it’s open.”

29:18.020 --> 29:20.180
But ego is there, so the ego says,

29:20.380 --> 29:21.900
“But it may not be there.”

29:22.100 --> 29:24.260
I mean, if it is not there we’ll not buy it!

29:24.460 --> 29:28.263
Simple as that. But why before buying that, or going there,

29:28.463 --> 29:32.463
why give such an explanation as that, that it may not be there?

29:34.504 --> 29:36.211
That is what it is,

29:36.901 --> 29:39.700
that you have to get your Realisation,

29:40.034 --> 29:42.503
you have to become what you are,

29:43.767 --> 29:46.504
you have to understand how it works.

29:46.705 --> 29:48.705
It’s all your own.

29:50.235 --> 29:51.846
Supposing

29:52.583 --> 29:56.380
all your treasure is locked up in a bank and I am a banker

29:56.665 --> 29:58.166
and you come to me.

29:58.367 --> 30:00.509
Then I have to give you your keys

30:00.710 --> 30:03.520
and I have to tell you how to open

30:03.721 --> 30:05.860
your treasures and what do they mean,

30:06.060 --> 30:07.620
isn’t it? That’s my duty.

30:07.820 --> 30:10.100
But if I am doing that duty people ask me,

30:10.300 --> 30:11.889
“Why should you do it?”

30:12.090 --> 30:13.890
Because I am the banker!

30:15.092 --> 30:17.238
“So, why are you the banker?” Better go and ask

30:17.438 --> 30:19.460
God why I am the banker!

30:19.660 --> 30:22.846
But can you become the banker? You cannot!

30:23.128 --> 30:25.956
But when you become, you will become.

30:26.565 --> 30:28.148
When you are not, you are not.

30:28.356 --> 30:32.267
When you will be appointed as a
banker you will be acting as a banker, too.

30:32.774 --> 30:35.285
It’s as simple as that.

30:37.411 --> 30:39.821
So you get your Realisation

30:40.616 --> 30:43.880
and you understand those who have got it have got it.

30:45.591 --> 30:47.900
Even you will be surprised once

30:48.100 --> 30:50.300
I gave Realisation to one gentleman.

30:51.945 --> 30:53.917
He never came to Sahaj Yoga as such,

30:54.117 --> 30:56.340
and he didn’t become much.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.300
So one day he went to

31:00.969 --> 31:02.609
see a judge,

31:04.257 --> 31:07.060
a justice in the high court in Bombay,

31:07.260 --> 31:10.740
who was a realised-soul, too; Mr. Vaidya.

31:11.496 --> 31:13.420
So, Mr. Vaidya asked him,

31:14.340 --> 31:16.660
“Do you know Mataji Nirmala Devi?” He said, “Yes.”

31:16.860 --> 31:18.997
“Did she give you Realisation?” “Yes.”

31:19.197 --> 31:22.180
“I know.” “How do you know, sir?”

31:22.615 --> 31:24.260
He said, “I can feel it.

31:24.460 --> 31:27.420
Of course, it’s very mild but it’s flowing.”

31:30.512 --> 31:33.260
Still the Divine is working,

31:33.538 --> 31:35.253
but why not cooperate,

31:35.453 --> 31:37.740
and why not help the Divine?

31:38.621 --> 31:41.036
Why not make the best out of it?

31:41.237 --> 31:44.820
A little bit of cooperation and understanding and will-power

31:46.059 --> 31:48.762
can give you everything that you have.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.830
It’s all your own and you have to have it.

31:52.213 --> 31:54.702
I am very happy to come back to London now

31:54.903 --> 31:56.413
to talk to you.

31:56.886 --> 31:59.326
I think London

31:59.537 --> 32:01.420
and England as a whole

32:01.620 --> 32:04.780
has very sound Sahaj Yogis, very sound,

32:04.980 --> 32:07.020
sensible, wise,

32:07.776 --> 32:09.900
hard-working Sahaj Yogis.

32:12.101 --> 32:15.380
And the youth of England

32:15.580 --> 32:18.980
are really the best today in the West.

32:22.197 --> 32:24.020
They are not shallow

32:24.948 --> 32:27.180
and they are not such

32:28.123 --> 32:31.420
wobbly things like Americans.

32:33.918 --> 32:36.740
And they are not bound by the idea of death

32:36.940 --> 32:39.100
like the Switzerland people are.

32:39.358 --> 32:42.460
Swiss people are on one side
doing Sahaj Yoga and on the other side

32:42.660 --> 32:44.980
planning how to commit suicide.

32:48.259 --> 32:51.740
And they are not miserable like French are:

32:51.940 --> 32:55.060
they are so miserable that they want to drink away their life

32:55.260 --> 32:57.596
and indulge in prostitution

32:57.796 --> 32:59.880
because they are extremely miserable.

33:00.705 --> 33:02.300
They don’t want to laugh, you see.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.140
They think to laugh is a sinful thing.

33:05.340 --> 33:09.020
But all other sins you can commit:
as long as you don’t laugh, it’s all right.

33:12.375 --> 33:15.580
You should never have any fun in life. If you have fun

33:15.780 --> 33:18.500
you should do all the sins with great seriousness

33:18.700 --> 33:21.100
then it’s all right, it’s no sin.

33:22.926 --> 33:26.119
It’s a funny idea of detachment they have developed!

33:28.232 --> 33:29.840
So we have Italians,

33:30.041 --> 33:31.950
who are good for emotional,

33:32.151 --> 33:34.700
who are very good at recognising me.

33:35.737 --> 33:37.540
But to understand Sahaja Yoga

33:37.740 --> 33:40.100
a little more soundness is needed.

33:40.567 --> 33:43.144
They’ll settle down very soon, I think.

33:43.345 --> 33:44.968
But basically

33:45.234 --> 33:48.159
they are very sensitive people, very sensitive.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.180
But sensitivity is not sufficient:

33:50.380 --> 33:53.220
you must have soundness behind it. Even if you are sensitive

33:53.420 --> 33:56.980
and you recognise me, you must have that soundness

33:58.031 --> 33:59.872
to understand

34:00.151 --> 34:02.207
the immense

34:06.951 --> 34:09.100
advantages of Sahaj Yoga,

34:09.761 --> 34:12.200
the greatest dynamics

34:12.957 --> 34:14.500
of Sahaj Yog.

34:15.021 --> 34:17.913
This is the solution of all the problems of the world,

34:18.114 --> 34:19.631
believe me.

34:20.035 --> 34:22.220
Today I had to attend a dinner

34:22.420 --> 34:24.220
on a ship and I was chief

34:26.243 --> 34:28.111
guest, chief guest.

34:28.312 --> 34:31.553
But I just told my husband that, “Today, please excuse me.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.720
This is God’s work

34:36.985 --> 34:40.020
and nobody can do that but me. I have to do it,

34:40.220 --> 34:43.620
so please excuse me.” He said, “It’s all right. It’s all right.”

34:43.820 --> 34:46.835
Normally he would not because I was one of the

34:47.036 --> 34:50.233
- I mean, he was a chief guest,
I was his wife. I was supposed to be there

34:50.434 --> 34:52.070
and on the ship and everything.

34:52.271 --> 34:55.548
But when I said, “This is God’s work. That’s important.”

34:55.899 --> 34:57.437
He also feels

34:58.557 --> 35:00.380
the importance of this work.

35:02.987 --> 35:05.540
So if you have that intelligence,

35:05.825 --> 35:09.797
basic intelligence, also you can see how important it is today.

35:13.081 --> 35:16.860
I am happy today; those who are new will get their Realisation.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.260
But not only getting their Realisation:

35:19.460 --> 35:21.100
you have to keep

35:22.301 --> 35:24.980
in a way that you proceed further with it,

35:25.180 --> 35:27.935
grow further with it. You have to have patience.

35:28.433 --> 35:30.780
You have to understand it

35:31.200 --> 35:34.020
in a very sound and a wise manner.

35:34.220 --> 35:37.140
You have to have your wisdom completely intact

35:37.863 --> 35:39.616
and give a chance to yourself.

35:39.817 --> 35:42.779
Just don’t discard it, “Oh! I haven’t felt it!”

35:42.979 --> 35:44.867
As if some people are proud of it!

35:45.068 --> 35:47.300
If they haven’t felt it there’s something wrong

35:47.500 --> 35:49.451
and they have to feel it.

35:52.982 --> 35:55.249
I am sure this will work out today

35:55.450 --> 35:59.370
and add to our Sahaja Yoga people

36:00.460 --> 36:03.489
which is the solution of all the problems,

36:03.690 --> 36:05.330
of all the problems.

36:06.695 --> 36:10.328
In India there was a speaker called Mr. Bagde

36:10.529 --> 36:13.660
who invited me to his speech in a village he had gone,

36:13.860 --> 36:15.404
in a district place.

36:15.605 --> 36:17.860
And there was a big crowd and he was addressing and,

36:18.060 --> 36:20.119
of course, he is a Sahaj Yogi,

36:20.320 --> 36:22.999
but still not such a great Sahaj Yogi,

36:23.199 --> 36:24.780
I should say, because he started saying

36:24.980 --> 36:27.340
that, “We have certain problems in our country.

36:27.540 --> 36:29.171
We have caste system

36:29.371 --> 36:31.420
and we have all these things – it’s a big problem.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.340
Like, in other countries

36:34.540 --> 36:37.620
they have race problems and this, that and we have

36:37.820 --> 36:39.980
also these problems

36:40.412 --> 36:44.309
within us that we talk of different castes.”

36:46.369 --> 36:48.660
So I said, “There is a solution for it.

36:49.197 --> 36:52.620
If you are reborn your complete birth is changed.

36:52.820 --> 36:55.340
You are no more English, no more American.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.980
You are no more an Indian to have a caste system:

36:58.181 --> 36:59.873
you are a Yogi,

37:00.285 --> 37:02.380
you are a realised-soul

37:02.679 --> 37:04.179
and you have no caste,

37:04.451 --> 37:07.801
you have no religion, you have no race, you are beyond it.

37:10.226 --> 37:12.117
That’s what,” and he was surprised. I said,

37:12.318 --> 37:14.399
“That’s how you’ll solve the problem!”

37:15.955 --> 37:18.294
This human life

37:18.495 --> 37:20.049
is like that

37:20.696 --> 37:22.539
– it gives you identifications:

37:22.740 --> 37:24.420
you are English,

37:24.620 --> 37:27.940
you are rich, you are poor, you’re this, you are that,

37:28.594 --> 37:30.460
you are Indian.

37:32.138 --> 37:34.220
All sorts of identifications:

37:34.420 --> 37:37.980
you are a king, you are a minister, minister’s son and

37:38.180 --> 37:40.915
governor’s son and all those things.

37:41.116 --> 37:44.180
But once you become a Yogi you are a Yogi,

37:45.973 --> 37:48.553
because there is no unreal

37:48.753 --> 37:50.494
thing existing any more within us.

37:50.695 --> 37:54.315
These are all unreal identifications which just drop out.

37:55.042 --> 37:58.700
So many people in this country have taken to lives

37:58.900 --> 38:01.660
which are alternate lives, as they call it,

38:01.951 --> 38:04.980
and also their dress is changed, everything changed,

38:05.180 --> 38:07.197
but it’s all outside.

38:08.212 --> 38:11.205
And by that they felt that they have achieved

38:11.406 --> 38:12.813
a kind

38:13.014 --> 38:14.759
of a change within themselves,

38:14.959 --> 38:16.740
but it’s not true,

38:16.940 --> 38:18.540
it’s not true.

38:20.155 --> 38:22.380
The unreal must drop out.

38:23.112 --> 38:26.100
The whole unreal must drop out. Once it drops out

38:26.300 --> 38:29.020
then only you become the real personality.

38:31.651 --> 38:34.340
By changing outside, nothing changes

38:34.713 --> 38:36.740
and that has to happen

38:37.393 --> 38:38.926
to all of you,

38:39.426 --> 38:41.335
to all the seekers of the Earth.

38:41.539 --> 38:45.420
Sahaj Yoga is only meant for seekers and for nobody else.

38:46.676 --> 38:49.700
I am only interested among the true seekers

38:49.900 --> 38:52.490
and not among other people who are seeking power,

38:52.691 --> 38:54.345
seeking this, seeking that.

38:54.546 --> 38:57.780
It’s all also artificial, absolutely artificial.

38:58.386 --> 39:00.340
About that, I’ll tell you later on

39:00.540 --> 39:03.260
how these things are absolutely artificial.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.615
May God bless you all!

39:08.473 --> 39:11.573
If you have any questions you may ask.

39:45.609 --> 39:47.297
Any questions?

40:00.544 --> 40:02.660
Are you all Sahaj Yogis?

40:05.549 --> 40:07.740
How many of you have come for the first time?

40:07.940 --> 40:09.440
Raise your hands.

40:17.598 --> 40:19.420
Can you come forward,

40:19.620 --> 40:21.499
all those who have come for the first time?

40:21.699 --> 40:24.140
Two lines you should have, occupy.

40:29.988 --> 40:31.468
You all should get up.

40:32.841 --> 40:35.079
Douglas, I think you all should get up.

40:35.279 --> 40:38.340
Please be seated there. You let them be seated.

40:41.297 --> 40:44.941
So now you can see how many are realised-souls sitting here

40:45.683 --> 40:48.080
and you have to just join their group, isn’t it?

40:48.261 --> 40:49.940
Please make yourself comfortable there.

40:50.140 --> 40:52.620
Now what about here?

40:52.820 --> 40:54.940
Those who are Sahaj Yogis should go behind.

40:55.140 --> 40:56.993
Please come and join here.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.274
Lady: We can’t hear you at all.

41:04.474 --> 41:06.410
We couldn't hear you at all. We can’t hear you.

41:06.610 --> 41:09.260
Shri Mataji: Really? Is it so bad?

41:10.726 --> 41:12.269
Oh God!

41:12.470 --> 41:14.029
What’s the problem?

41:14.230 --> 41:15.734
Douglas,

41:16.515 --> 41:18.187
they couldn’t hear me?

41:19.107 --> 41:20.900
I’m sorry for that.

41:22.257 --> 41:24.740
Douglas: It’s coming through the loud speaker.

41:25.782 --> 41:27.358
Can you not hear in the back?

41:27.559 --> 41:30.304
Seekers: Yes, we could. Shri Mataji: You heard?

41:35.482 --> 41:39.377
Lady: We couldn’t hear you at all.
Shri Mataji: All right, let’s see what’s the reason. All right?

41:39.578 --> 41:41.510
Please make yourself comfortable.

41:44.781 --> 41:47.889
Ray? Let them there on the second seat would be better

41:48.090 --> 41:50.296
all of them so we can look after them.

42:01.667 --> 42:04.460
You were feeling only the ego

42:04.660 --> 42:06.105
or what?

42:08.093 --> 42:11.300
All right, that could be one of the tricks of Sahaj Yoga.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.617
All right, let’s see what happens.

42:14.628 --> 42:17.309
I also don’t hear many people

42:17.941 --> 42:21.641
clearly and unless and until you are a
realised-soul I find it very difficult to hear,

42:21.841 --> 42:24.340
so I have to ask somebody to tell me in my ears.

42:24.540 --> 42:26.805
The frequency doesn’t go into my ears, too!

42:27.005 --> 42:29.278
So let’s see what the problem is.

42:38.244 --> 42:40.220
Now close your eyes.

42:40.420 --> 42:42.460
Put your hands just like this, that’s all

42:42.660 --> 42:44.900
and take out your shoes if possible.

42:47.319 --> 42:49.603
Now the whole thing, process takes

42:49.804 --> 42:52.860
hardly any time. It’s just a very short time:

42:53.794 --> 42:55.500
a split of a second.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.638
But if there are any

42:57.838 --> 42:59.932
barriers in between,

43:01.037 --> 43:03.020
then there could be a problem.

43:03.846 --> 43:06.420
So it takes a little more time, doesn’t matter:

43:07.230 --> 43:09.230
to err is human, isn’t it?

43:10.785 --> 43:13.500
So it doesn’t matter. Whatever is the problem

43:13.700 --> 43:15.417
it has to be worked out.

43:15.947 --> 43:18.268
When it doesn’t work out in you,

43:18.469 --> 43:21.420
some Sahaj Yogis will come round to help you.

43:22.676 --> 43:26.035
Now I must explain to you beforehand what happens.

43:26.930 --> 43:30.371
They have got this power flowing through

43:31.048 --> 43:32.550
their hands;

43:32.891 --> 43:36.507
and their fingers, as you see there,

43:38.061 --> 43:39.972
are decoding,

43:40.173 --> 43:42.941
giving messages, the fingers,

43:43.142 --> 43:46.599
about the centres where you have a problem.

43:47.220 --> 43:50.126
So they exactly know where the problem is.

43:50.412 --> 43:53.602
Also, they know how to cure that problem:

43:53.803 --> 43:55.724
so, they use their fingers,

43:56.239 --> 43:57.739
their hands.

43:58.049 --> 43:59.812
They won’t touch you,

44:00.881 --> 44:04.420
but they will know and they will try to correct you.

44:05.027 --> 44:06.987
So not to get frightened if they just

44:07.187 --> 44:09.980
come and raise your Kundalini or do something like that.

44:10.180 --> 44:11.820
There’s nothing to be frightened about.

44:12.020 --> 44:13.881
Nothing is going to happen to you.

44:14.082 --> 44:17.719
You are going to feel absolutely blissful and happy.

44:18.666 --> 44:20.506
You just don’t worry.

44:21.628 --> 44:23.131
All right.

44:24.325 --> 44:27.061
So put your, both the hands straight,

44:27.261 --> 44:29.361
just like this, and close your eyes.

44:29.749 --> 44:31.928
Now you need not stretch your body too much,

44:32.128 --> 44:34.220
nor you should slump it down.

44:34.420 --> 44:36.510
But sit comfortably with both the hands

44:36.710 --> 44:39.669
on your lap or on your

44:41.644 --> 44:44.940
legs like this, on the thighs like this.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.780
And keep your eyes shut please.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.740
Please keep them shut.

44:55.972 --> 44:59.969
Whatever has to happen will happen inside;

45:00.170 --> 45:01.670
nothing outside.

45:01.871 --> 45:04.834
There is no need to jump or to say something

45:05.034 --> 45:07.180
or to make a face or anything.

45:07.380 --> 45:09.207
Let it happen.

45:09.865 --> 45:12.978
Now there’s one more thing,

45:13.179 --> 45:17.092
one has to remember that it happens spontaneously

45:17.906 --> 45:21.339
and your attention should not be fixed on any point,

45:21.540 --> 45:23.940
just leave your attention free.

45:25.106 --> 45:28.260
Even if you are thinking for example, doesn’t matter.

45:28.507 --> 45:30.620
there’s nothing to worry

45:31.156 --> 45:34.339
about it because this happens spontaneously,

45:34.540 --> 45:36.595
your Kundalini rises

45:36.796 --> 45:40.380
and you get your Realisation spontaneously.

45:49.256 --> 45:51.739
So, don’t fix your attention anywhere.

45:51.940 --> 45:54.940
Just leave it loose, absolutely loose.

45:56.438 --> 45:58.420
Slowly you will find first of all

45:58.620 --> 46:00.820
that you are not thinking.

46:07.412 --> 46:08.940
One thing,

46:09.289 --> 46:12.420
that you please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

46:12.649 --> 46:14.983
Because the Kundalini doesn’t rise

46:15.184 --> 46:17.630
above the Agyna chakra

46:17.831 --> 46:20.900
– or the chakra which is in the brain

46:21.132 --> 46:22.789
– if you open your eyes.

46:22.990 --> 46:25.054
Please keep your eyes shut.

46:51.959 --> 46:55.300
Now, the left hand of yours represents

46:55.541 --> 46:58.183
your desire and the right hand

46:58.384 --> 47:00.340
is your action.

47:00.931 --> 47:04.334
Now, I’ll tell you how to use your right hand

47:04.535 --> 47:06.300
while keeping your left hand

47:06.500 --> 47:08.591
towards me on your lap.

47:09.785 --> 47:11.979
All the time you have to keep your left hand

47:12.179 --> 47:14.288
with stretched fingers on your lap,

47:14.489 --> 47:17.380
while the right hand is to be used

47:19.236 --> 47:21.108
on different centres.

47:22.364 --> 47:24.980
First of all, put the right hand

47:25.180 --> 47:28.180
on your heart on the left hand side

47:32.459 --> 47:34.340
and in your heart,

47:35.742 --> 47:37.308
not loudly,

47:37.509 --> 47:40.002
you have to ask a question to me,

47:40.203 --> 47:43.740
saying, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

47:43.940 --> 47:46.180
Ask this question thrice.

47:50.717 --> 47:53.660
Ask in any language, makes no difference.

47:55.947 --> 47:58.100
“Am I the Spirit?”

48:16.804 --> 48:19.146
Now, the quality of Spirit is

48:19.347 --> 48:22.300
that once the Spirit manifests in you,

48:22.500 --> 48:24.700
you become your own master,

48:24.900 --> 48:26.980
you become your own guru.

48:29.196 --> 48:31.340
So, please put the right hand

48:31.540 --> 48:33.513
down on the stomach on the left hand side

48:33.713 --> 48:36.700
and just press it with your fingers, on the left hand side.

48:37.135 --> 48:40.420
Put your hand on the left hand side and press it with your finger,

48:40.902 --> 48:43.526
little bit lower, yes.

48:43.727 --> 48:46.980
Now here,

48:47.251 --> 48:48.789
ten times,

48:50.502 --> 48:52.020
you have to say,

48:52.220 --> 48:55.580
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

49:37.690 --> 49:41.393
Now raise this right hand to your heart again

49:44.945 --> 49:46.455
and say now,

49:46.655 --> 49:49.183
assertively, with full confidence,

49:49.406 --> 49:52.862
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

49:53.063 --> 49:54.709
Please say it twelve times.

49:54.909 --> 49:57.620
It is according to the number

49:57.820 --> 50:01.660
of petals you have for your different centres.

50:03.445 --> 50:05.515
With full confidence, please say,

50:05.715 --> 50:07.780
“Mother I am the Spirit.”

50:07.980 --> 50:10.179
“I am the Atma.”

50:10.661 --> 50:12.232
Twelve times.

50:51.626 --> 50:53.820
Now put the right hand

50:55.490 --> 50:59.180
again on the left side of your neck.

50:59.380 --> 51:02.940
There’s a centre there, left side of your neck.

51:04.163 --> 51:08.113
Now, we have to know that the Spirit is

51:08.833 --> 51:10.900
without any blemish,

51:11.726 --> 51:14.859
without any guilt, nirdosh.

51:16.787 --> 51:18.861
So, we have to say at this point,

51:19.061 --> 51:22.465
“Mother I am not guilty. I am not at all guilty.”

51:22.666 --> 51:25.220
Forget about the past, forget it completely.

51:25.420 --> 51:27.577
You have to become a new life,

51:27.778 --> 51:31.339
so what do we say, “Mother I am not guilty.”

51:31.540 --> 51:34.513
You have to say that sixteen times, please.

51:39.330 --> 51:41.011
They have this problem,

51:41.212 --> 51:43.320
that’s why they couldn’t hear me.

51:43.521 --> 51:44.978
All right?

51:45.178 --> 51:47.275
That’s the problem you had:

51:47.475 --> 51:49.796
feeling guilty for nothing at all.

51:54.080 --> 51:55.900
Now say it with confidence,

51:56.100 --> 51:58.943
“Mother I am not guilty.” Say that,

52:05.228 --> 52:06.744
sixteen times.

52:13.655 --> 52:16.020
Just a very strong one there.

52:33.324 --> 52:37.020
Now, raise this hand if you have said it,

52:37.440 --> 52:39.740
to your forehead across.

52:42.698 --> 52:44.380
At this point

52:44.879 --> 52:47.403
you have to forgive everyone.

52:48.706 --> 52:51.017
You may say that it’s difficult,

52:52.884 --> 52:55.548
but when you do not forgive others

52:55.749 --> 52:58.949
you are playing into their hands and torturing yourself.

52:59.210 --> 53:01.860
Just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,”

53:03.999 --> 53:05.780
from your full heart,

53:06.110 --> 53:07.620
sincerely.

53:07.820 --> 53:11.813
Please say, “Mother I forgive everyone.” Say it thrice.

53:12.329 --> 53:13.898
Put it across.

53:26.870 --> 53:29.585
Now, put this hand on top of your head,

53:29.785 --> 53:32.320
resting on the head in the centre.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.940
The palm of the hand should be in the centre

53:35.140 --> 53:39.089
where it was a soft bone in your childhood: a little further.

53:39.378 --> 53:41.860
It’s not at the back side but further.

53:42.060 --> 53:43.980
Here, it is going to break.

53:44.382 --> 53:46.466
Just put it a little further.

53:46.667 --> 53:48.900
Still some people are having...

53:50.123 --> 53:51.754
Just try to feel it.

53:52.129 --> 53:55.380
Just rub it a little bit with your hand.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.652
In a clockwise manner you can move it also.

53:57.852 --> 54:00.773
Just push the hand up on your head.

54:00.974 --> 54:02.681
Put the palm; don’t open your,

54:02.881 --> 54:05.181
push it hard, little bit.

54:05.382 --> 54:06.882
Now,

54:09.538 --> 54:11.180
at this point

54:12.014 --> 54:15.646
I can’t force you to become realised,

54:16.067 --> 54:19.187
it’s your freedom, so I respect it.

54:19.475 --> 54:21.018
You have to ask

54:21.218 --> 54:23.740
or you have to say, “Mother I want my Realisation.

54:23.940 --> 54:25.860
Please give me Realisation,”

54:26.483 --> 54:28.260
seven times, please.

54:54.169 --> 54:57.481
Now, raise your hand and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

54:57.785 --> 54:59.580
You can change your hand also

54:59.780 --> 55:01.531
and see with the other hand.

55:01.731 --> 55:04.620
Put the right hand down and with the left hand you can see

55:04.820 --> 55:07.220
if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

55:08.489 --> 55:11.180
You have to certify yourself first of all.

55:12.342 --> 55:14.675
On top of your head, about four inches

55:14.875 --> 55:18.282
on top of your head, above.

55:18.620 --> 55:22.620
Just try to see if you are feeling any cool breeze coming out.

55:23.118 --> 55:24.900
It’s very subtle.

55:25.248 --> 55:28.405
You can change your hands and see.

55:34.817 --> 55:36.419
It’s very, very subtle

55:36.620 --> 55:40.085
and as we are going from gross level to subtle level

55:40.285 --> 55:42.351
our sensitivity is not so great.

55:42.552 --> 55:44.117
If you are feeling it

55:44.317 --> 55:47.417
then you can put down your hands, both the hands.

55:55.562 --> 55:58.460
First you must feel it on top of your head

56:00.310 --> 56:02.093
and if you don’t feel it

56:02.636 --> 56:04.367
then later on

56:04.606 --> 56:06.092
we’ll see how it works out.

56:06.293 --> 56:07.980
But those who are feeling it will

56:08.180 --> 56:10.537
start feeling it later on, on their hands.

56:16.744 --> 56:18.647
You can change over.

57:34.241 --> 57:36.939
Can some of the Sahaj Yogis see the people

57:37.261 --> 57:38.775
who have come for the first time?

57:38.976 --> 57:41.180
You can put down your hands on the seat,

57:41.380 --> 57:42.920
but don’t open your eyes still.

57:43.121 --> 57:45.300
Keep both the hands straight. It has to work out.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.434
It will work out, don’t you worry.

57:47.635 --> 57:50.886
Can some of you come in from the front line, please?

58:00.338 --> 58:03.106
Bala, just see your neighbour. Has she felt it?

58:03.781 --> 58:06.357
Can you come in front?

58:11.072 --> 58:12.787
Facing them you can.

58:12.988 --> 58:16.815
Alan, you can come facing them and some people can go behind.
