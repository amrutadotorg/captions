00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:53.158
Today it's a great day for us, for all the
Sahaja Yogis that on this day, I would say

00:10:53.253 --> 00:11:10.893
we are late by one day or two days, the Sahasrara
was opened out.

00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:28.950
It was just a miracle I should say because
I didn't think that I am at a point where

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.171
it could be done.

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:51.671
So I wanted to wait but some things happened
that made Me think that it has to be open.

00:11:57.744 --> 00:12:13.307
It was
in such a situation that I felt if I delayed

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:27.393
any more now, it may help these false gurus
to spread their nonsense all over.

00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:41.863
This is just I should say, is a Sahaj way
of doing things.

00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:46.703
Now 25 years have passed.

00:12:46.703 --> 00:12:54.086
You all have gathered during this time, and
we have so many others who are not here, who

00:12:54.111 --> 00:12:59.170
have achieved so many things.

00:12:59.421 --> 00:13:09.532
But perhaps, we are not aware as to what we
have achieved in the real sense of the word.

00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:13.481
You've got your vibrations.

00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:19.272
You can feel this All Pervading Power.

00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:25.811
You are as they say, swimming in the ocean
of joy.

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:37.922
You are all enjoying the collectivity, and
that you have transcended many of your limitations.

00:13:38.255 --> 00:13:45.576
All this has happened to you because it is
your right to have it.

00:13:45.988 --> 00:13:49.689
I don't take any credit for it.

00:13:49.689 --> 00:14:02.157
Only thing all the time I've been pointing
it out to you one thing that now, you have

00:14:02.182 --> 00:14:09.221
entered into the Kingdom of God, and enjoy
yourself.

00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:13.420
We have to see around ourselves.

00:14:13.445 --> 00:14:20.560
The whole nature enjoys itself; doesn't bother,
doesn't bother about anything.

00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:23.333
They haven't got realization.

00:14:23.358 --> 00:14:27.167
They haven't felt the Paramachaitanya.

00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:33.195
But how is it they know that we have to enjoy?

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:41.434
The flowers that come out for a short time
and fade out, but as long as they live,

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:43.275
they're very happy.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:50.932
They don't think of their past or of their
future, but they enjoy the present.

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:57.700
And in the present, they enjoy what is - that
they are fragrant

00:14:57.725 --> 00:14:59.768
and giving fragrance to others.

00:14:59.793 --> 00:15:03.816
They're beautiful and they are soothing others.

00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:06.656
The whole nature is like that.

00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:16.338
If you look at the birds or anything that
we call as natural is all sort of

00:15:16.363 --> 00:15:18.419
in a meditative mood.

00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:25.041
All these hills, and big, big mountains.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:33.440
They look as if they are witness to whatever
has been happening.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:42.680
Now we have to really first look back what
we have achieved.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:51.105
That is important, because if you're climbing
up on a hill, if you look back,

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.185
 you get a shock and you may fall down.

00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:58.349
So normally people say, never look back.

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:10.469
But a person who has earned some treasure,
he again and again goes and counts it and

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:18.180
finds out how much he has got, and every time
he sees that, he enjoys.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:27.399
So to know relatively what we have got and
how we have achieved something will definitely

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:37.570
give you greater strength of mind and richness
of life.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:45.190
The first thing that has happened to you I
would say it is very important is this - that

00:16:45.215 --> 00:16:49.420
you have felt this All Pervading Power.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:59.090
That shows that you must have been great seekers
of truth, honest, sincere, sensible.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:12.969
That just coming to My program you felt the
vibrations, and after that you started settling

00:17:12.969 --> 00:17:15.029
down into it.

00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:22.839
So many of you have felt it suddenly, and
they were amazed and they were shocked and

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:29.330
surprised, and they wanted to test whether
it is true or not.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:38.310
But then you were confident, you found it
that you've got definitely a new dimension

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:48.270
in your life, and that you are feeling this
All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:54.930
I'll take one lecture sufficient to describe
this All Pervading Power.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:18:05.609
But what you got out of it is the essence
of it, one has to know, is a complete freedom.

00:18:05.887 --> 00:18:08.387
You have achieved your complete freedom.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:15.838
First of all, the freedom has come to you,
first of all, most important,

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:18.776
is from your ego.

00:18:19.825 --> 00:18:24.127
This wall of ego you have crossed.

00:18:24.168 --> 00:18:37.191
You have got out of the bondage of this ego,
which was really so much full of

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:39.446
problems for you.

00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:45.770
So many things this ego does of which you
are not aware.

00:18:45.797 --> 00:18:51.987
Firstly, a person who is egoist doesn't mind
hurting anyone.

00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:58.125
He hurts, but if he's hurt, he doesn't like
it.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.757
Immediately start crying.

00:18:59.782 --> 00:19:07.542
Specially I've seen people who have too much
ego are very easily hurt, but they don't understand

00:19:07.567 --> 00:19:20.287
how many people they have hurt already, and
how many are really frightened of such a person.

00:19:20.824 --> 00:19:24.473
So you got rid of your ego.

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:32.459
It is sinful to hurt any other human being
for anything; for whatever may be the reason

00:19:32.484 --> 00:19:35.916
that you feel you should hurt another one.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:43.622
The first is the revenge; the idea of revenge
is there, that I must take a revenge on the

00:19:43.647 --> 00:19:54.513
person who has hurt me or has done some wrong
to me or something of that kind.

00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:58.771
This idea of revenge comes when you react.

00:19:58.973 --> 00:20:01.362
Some react very violently.

00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:09.678
I have seen people murdering each other in
the name of revenge, killing their own kith

00:20:10.647 --> 00:20:17.656
and kin, killing their fellow men, their country
men, all over the world is some sort of a

00:20:17.656 --> 00:20:22.937
stupid idea of revenge.

00:20:22.937 --> 00:20:28.316
But if you go to the subtle side of revenge,
what is it?

00:20:28.341 --> 00:20:30.576
What revenge have you taken?

00:20:30.702 --> 00:20:33.301
Supposing there is somebody who has troubled
you.

00:20:33.326 --> 00:20:37.902
You are angry with that person and you have
killed that person, so you have actually

00:20:37.927 --> 00:20:39.386
saved him.

00:20:40.067 --> 00:20:47.187
He won't have to suffer from guilty conscience,
it won't have to do anything, it's just finished.

00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:49.583
What is the revenge is?

00:20:50.092 --> 00:21:00.016
The revenge should be only by which a person
gets out of his idea of killing others.

00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:05.588
Like a sword never fights a sword, it fights
the shield.

00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:18.533
In the same way, the revenge that we think
we can take on another person is not a revenge,

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:25.637
because any action you take in the name of
revenge comes back to you

00:21:25.662 --> 00:21:27.955
and hurts you much more.

00:21:28.684 --> 00:21:34.300
So many things can happen if a person in the
name of revenge starts acting.

00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:37.772
Now for example, these days you know in the
whole world,

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.225
 there's so much of revenge going on,

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:49.387
even in the name of God; taking revenge
because certain people are following some

00:21:49.412 --> 00:21:54.957
religion, or they are doing something else
that you are doing.

00:21:54.982 --> 00:22:02.032
Working out this kind of a revenge, what has
happening is that you are just killing people,

00:22:02.057 --> 00:22:09.007
destroying them, who do not even understand
what sort of a revenge you are taking.

00:22:09.032 --> 00:22:15.696
People are putting bombs and putting all kinds
of things and by that thousands of innocent

00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:20.932
people one is killing; so what kind of a revenge
have you taken?

00:22:21.755 --> 00:22:24.182
They don't deserve any revenge.

00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:31.991
So this revenge when it explodes can destroy
so many innocent people and it will definitely

00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:34.136
react on you.

00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:37.227
You cannot get away with it.

00:22:37.402 --> 00:22:43.301
It's a very long process of this revenge.

00:22:45.951 --> 00:22:54.003
I've told you about Bermuda Triangle what
they say, that so many blacks were taken slaves

00:22:54.028 --> 00:23:01.685
and were drowned in that area, so their spirits
they are saying, are haunting on the people

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:06.586
who are passing by; mostly the whites and
they just drowned.

00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:13.928
So it's a very long process, and all that
I need not discuss at this auspicious occasion,

00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:20.241
but I have to say that when we take a revenge,
every action has a reaction.

00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:29.007
So somehow you have got out of that idea of
revenge, just out of that idea.

00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:38.077
There's another thing that if you don't take
revenge, and leave it to God, It acts.

00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:49.614
It acts, not only that, but a Divine Power
takes into Its own control how to really give

00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:58.665
a good lesson to that person or to that community
or to that kind of organization which is taking

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.753
a revenge on you.

00:24:01.903 --> 00:24:06.361
You don't have to worry.

00:24:06.504 --> 00:24:10.111
I'll have to tell you that in this 25 years
I've seen,

00:24:10.136 --> 00:24:12.900
 people have been extremely unkind to me.

00:24:13.183 --> 00:24:20.222
Many organizations, many so called religions,
and all kinds of things have been after us.

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:22.444
Media has been after us.

00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:25.730
Take the example of French media.

00:24:25.794 --> 00:24:34.583
They tried to trouble us so much and tried
to bring bad name to us, doesn't matter.

00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:42.014
The media people now, three of them who went
to India, are now under warrant and if they

00:24:42.014 --> 00:24:46.683
go to India, they will be arrested.

00:24:46.683 --> 00:24:48.143
I didn't do anything.

00:24:48.143 --> 00:24:50.924
We didn't do anything.

00:24:50.949 --> 00:24:59.639
Secondly, the same media, I mean the same
newspapers are all bankrupt.

00:25:00.234 --> 00:25:02.157
You didn't do anything about it.

00:25:02.182 --> 00:25:04.916
You didn't go and say that they should become
bankrupt.

00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:06.067
You didn't take any revenge.

00:25:06.092 --> 00:25:07.370
Why should we?

00:25:07.395 --> 00:25:09.771
Why should we take any revenge?

00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:17.595
Because we are not bothered as to what happens;
we are not bothered as to what these people

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.794
have done to us.

00:25:19.794 --> 00:25:27.364
But legally they are now involved in such
a way that they are under warrant and if they

00:25:27.364 --> 00:25:30.344
go to India, they'll be arrested.

00:25:30.344 --> 00:25:37.664
And the whole of French government is with
them, all of them are trying so much, but

00:25:37.664 --> 00:25:41.273
this punishment is on their head.

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:45.372
In their lifetime, they didn't have to die
or anything;

00:25:45.397 --> 00:25:48.380
 in their lifetime they have got it.

00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:56.888
So you have got this special power that you
don't have to take revenge or you have to

00:25:56.913 --> 00:25:58.353
just forgive.

00:25:58.378 --> 00:26:07.367
Just forgive and the forgiveness will look
after the whole arrangement of how to bring

00:26:07.404 --> 00:26:13.213
the other person to its proper path.

00:26:13.213 --> 00:26:23.203
So once you are out of this idea of revenge,
you really feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful

00:26:23.203 --> 00:26:30.228
because this peace that you have within yourself
is not unnatural, it's not mental, but its

00:26:30.253 --> 00:26:31.733
just happens to you.

00:26:31.758 --> 00:26:32.727
It's all right.

00:26:32.767 --> 00:26:36.808
So what if they have said, they have done
anything wrong to us?

00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:38.675
Why should we bother?

00:26:38.765 --> 00:26:45.244
So many things are there which I can tell
you have worked out automatically.

00:26:46.545 --> 00:26:55.642
Now in Turkey they told Me that there is some
boy who is from England and he went and told

00:26:55.667 --> 00:27:00.764
the media something against Sahaja Yoga and
it was all published.

00:27:00.813 --> 00:27:06.463
But in the court he confessed that, "Whatever
I said was wrong."

00:27:06.488 --> 00:27:10.449
Nobody went and told him, nobody threatened
him, nothing happened.

00:27:10.474 --> 00:27:18.258
So from your point of view you must understand,
that you're not going to get into any mess

00:27:18.283 --> 00:27:25.778
of taking revenge of any kind, because you
belong to the Government of God.

00:27:25.896 --> 00:27:35.323
And this Government is extremely alert, very
genuine and also extremely efficient.

00:27:35.825 --> 00:27:43.216
And as far as you are concerned, you are a
citizen of that Great Kingdom.

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:49.984
So what you have achieved is the citizenship
of this great Kingdom of God where you should

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:52.135
feel absolutely secured.

00:27:53.312 --> 00:27:59.582
The man who is secure is never afraid, never
afraid.

00:27:59.607 --> 00:28:04.676
So you have also got rid of your fear.

00:28:04.701 --> 00:28:11.404
Man is in the - I don't know why he's afraid
of this and afraid of that, and worries about

00:28:11.429 --> 00:28:13.666
this and worries about that.

00:28:14.979 --> 00:28:22.136
It's something surprising how they worry about
their health, worry about their family, their

00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:27.506
children, their house, I mean all sorts of
things.

00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:31.221
But Sahaja Yogis don't, they don't.

00:28:32.005 --> 00:28:33.735
We have no worry.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.483
It all works out.

00:28:35.508 --> 00:28:37.142
Why should we worry?

00:28:37.386 --> 00:28:40.157
That instrument of worry is over.

00:28:40.212 --> 00:28:43.921
It's finished; I think it's gone out of order.

00:28:43.946 --> 00:28:53.266
And what you are now in a state where you
just have no time to worry, because you are

00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:54.614
enjoying yourself.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:06.800
This fear I have seen in people works so much
that so many diseases people get out of fear,

00:29:06.825 --> 00:29:12.930
so many diseases, specially most of these
left sided diseases people get out of fear.

00:29:12.955 --> 00:29:14.954
What is there to fear?

00:29:15.395 --> 00:29:21.084
This is like you beat the Mother Earth saying
that there's a snake.

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:26.585
There's no snake, but you may just feel that
way and you may go on with this fear.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:37.610
Anybody, any kind of a idea about a phantom
or someone or some sort of a big devil standing

00:29:37.635 --> 00:29:41.225
somewhere; it is all nonsense.

00:29:41.345 --> 00:29:43.795
For you, it doesn't exist.

00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:50.183
Say in the darkness you are walking so you
see forms and things and some people say I

00:29:50.208 --> 00:29:56.640
saw one on a tree, one some sort of a form;
it doesn't exist actually, it doesn't exist.

00:29:56.859 --> 00:30:00.808
But this fear in man makes him think like
that.

00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:06.339
He's afraid of this and afraid of that, and
then as a result, he loses his freedom.

00:30:06.364 --> 00:30:14.719
He becomes slave, slave to so many people
he's afraid of - that such and such man will

00:30:14.744 --> 00:30:23.034
harm me, such and such man will trouble Me,
and the whole concept of fear has ruined our

00:30:23.059 --> 00:30:24.698
family lives.

00:30:25.358 --> 00:30:33.073
For example, a wife is dominating, husband
is dominating, there's nothing to fear, nothing

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:33.772
to fear.

00:30:33.797 --> 00:30:37.528
By fear only you play into their hands.

00:30:37.553 --> 00:30:41.663
So supposing the wife is dominating, just
make fun out of it.

00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:48.063
If you cannot make the fun in the presence
of say your wife or your husband, better make

00:30:48.088 --> 00:30:49.013
it outside.

00:30:49.038 --> 00:30:50.985
Take it, "Oh look at that."

00:30:51.614 --> 00:31:01.385
It is your special quality now that you can
really get rid of your fear completely.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.840
What is there to be afraid of wife or afraid
of husband?

00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:06.861
What can he do to you?

00:31:06.886 --> 00:31:11.706
At the most he'll kill you, so what, you are
going to die in anyway.

00:31:14.913 --> 00:31:18.933
So the fear of death is another nonsense people
have.

00:31:18.958 --> 00:31:26.078
First time when I started My work everywhere
they asked Me, "What about death?"

00:31:26.148 --> 00:31:30.333
I said, but just now you are living; why are
you asking, "What about death?"

00:31:30.358 --> 00:31:33.787
So many people ask Me question, "What about
our death";

00:31:33.812 --> 00:31:35.633
 with why do you want to know about it?

00:31:35.658 --> 00:31:38.544
I'll tell you what about today, just now.

00:31:38.889 --> 00:31:46.719
So this is another mad idea - that we should
know about our death, what's going to happen,

00:31:46.744 --> 00:31:48.283
and whatever happens.

00:31:48.308 --> 00:31:50.107
Once you are dead you are finished.

00:31:50.132 --> 00:31:52.207
You don't have to do anything after that.

00:31:52.232 --> 00:31:58.017
So what's the use of knowing when, when you
will die, what will happen to you?

00:31:58.042 --> 00:32:00.192
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:32:00.217 --> 00:32:03.557
We never ask, that when I sleep what will
happen to me, do we?

00:32:03.582 --> 00:32:09.202
And this is a permanent sleep and we worry
so much about it that we should know what

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:11.332
will happen after death.

00:32:11.357 --> 00:32:17.205
One has to die at the time whenever it has
to die, because whatever is born has to be

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.376
dead.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:27.020
But you do know that you have got eternal
life.

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:29.585
You can never die.

00:32:29.983 --> 00:32:42.158
Death is not this body disappearing; death
is where you are absolutely without any control

00:32:42.183 --> 00:32:44.181
of your soul live.

00:32:44.774 --> 00:32:54.572
Once you are a realized soul you have all
the control, all the powers: to take your

00:32:54.597 --> 00:33:00.237
soul wherever you feel like, to be born if
you like; if you don't want you will not be

00:33:00.262 --> 00:33:08.872
born, to be born with the people in the families,
in the communities wherever you like.

00:33:08.897 --> 00:33:15.597
There are many great souls I know that have
taken birth daringly into societies which

00:33:15.622 --> 00:33:23.512
are very much, I should say, deteriorating
and are in danger of getting destroyed because

00:33:23.537 --> 00:33:25.993
of stupidity they do.

00:33:26.018 --> 00:33:40.893
So this happening, that we are afraid of death,
is absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:44.633
What is there to think even about your death?

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:52.280
There is nothing like death for you because
you have got eternal life.

00:33:52.305 --> 00:33:56.415
It's not that you continue with the same body.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.725
You may go on changing your dress but you
are living, you are aware, and you know even

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:10.037
if this body is not there-you will be there;
all the time, available for Sahaja Yoga, for

00:34:10.062 --> 00:34:15.612
anything that is to be done in the name of
reality.

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:29.098
So you must know your position as eternal
being what is your work, what is your idea,

00:34:29.123 --> 00:34:30.790
what you have to do.

00:34:30.815 --> 00:34:39.846
So one has to get rid of this idea of death
because death doesn't exist for you.

00:34:39.871 --> 00:34:41.141
It's finished.

00:34:41.422 --> 00:34:49.252
Moreover, all such people who are afraid of
their death go on having insurances, this,

00:34:49.277 --> 00:34:54.831
that, all headaches, see, and ultimately what
happens?

00:34:55.363 --> 00:35:00.278
All these worldly things you leave here and
you depart.

00:35:00.303 --> 00:35:11.255
There is I don't think anybody could carry
even a little dust with that soul

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.858
which is departing.

00:35:13.474 --> 00:35:22.388
But in your case, when you people are no more
on this earth so called, then you don't carry

00:35:22.413 --> 00:35:24.880
all this material things because you have
already given up.

00:35:24.905 --> 00:35:26.925
You have no interest in them.

00:35:27.077 --> 00:35:37.177
You're not materialistic so your spirit is
free, and when you die what happens to you

00:35:37.202 --> 00:35:43.482
is a very simple thing - that you feel very
liberated, absolutely.

00:35:44.504 --> 00:35:52.561
And then you feel your freedom completely,
and you can decide what you want to do.

00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:59.438
It's all under your own guidance, your own
desire; everything works out.

00:35:59.585 --> 00:36:06.993
You don't feel that you have come out of your
body, and this is what should tell you that

00:36:07.018 --> 00:36:14.886
there should be no fear of death, but on the
contrary - it should be welcomed.

00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:22.841
Because you will feel much more liberated,
much more at ease.

00:36:22.866 --> 00:36:28.932
You don't have other problems that you have
to in any case carry on in this world so because

00:36:28.957 --> 00:36:30.087
of this body.

00:36:30.112 --> 00:36:36.307
Now see I have to take some medicines, I have
to take vitamins; don't have to take anything,

00:36:36.332 --> 00:36:37.871
don't need it.

00:36:38.504 --> 00:36:41.276
This body's finished is a very good idea.

00:36:43.526 --> 00:36:47.146
They're so troublesome it is you see.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.859
All the time despite the fact that you may
say that, "Oh I don't care for this body,"

00:36:50.884 --> 00:36:54.283
and all that, but this body won't leave you.

00:36:54.308 --> 00:36:59.188
This is the most sticky thing we have is our
body.

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:10.843
So to forget about death should be the easiest
thing for you.

00:37:11.193 --> 00:37:14.743
We have broken many walls.

00:37:15.572 --> 00:37:26.002
As you know very well that the conditionings
we had, we have finished that.

00:37:26.082 --> 00:37:27.659
It's very surprising.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:32.715
I've seen people when they get their realization,
immediately after that

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.458
they start seeing around them.

00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:41.352
They'll immediately tell you what's wrong
with their religion, then they'll tell you

00:37:41.377 --> 00:37:46.360
what's wrong with their country; what's wrong
with their culture.

00:37:46.385 --> 00:37:49.455
It's through them I have come to know so much.

00:37:49.455 --> 00:37:52.905
I didn't know that this was so, but they themselves
told us.

00:37:52.905 --> 00:37:59.415
Now for example there's a French man, take
it - if a Frenchman gets realization, I mean

00:37:59.415 --> 00:38:02.765
you know everything about French.

00:38:02.765 --> 00:38:07.505
The things you could never even imagine what
sort of people they are; they will tell you

00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:08.505
everything.

00:38:08.505 --> 00:38:11.105
Same with the English I've seen.

00:38:11.105 --> 00:38:18.215
English they may, they laugh at themselves
all right, but actually when they become realized

00:38:18.215 --> 00:38:24.465
souls you see, they give you a complete picture
of English people: what sort of people are

00:38:24.465 --> 00:38:28.325
there, what's wrong with them, how they are
egoistical, this, that.

00:38:28.325 --> 00:38:29.325
I was amazed.

00:38:29.325 --> 00:38:34.495
I mean, I, I, I never knew so many things
which I came to know through Sahaja Yogis

00:38:34.495 --> 00:38:36.285
who got realization.

00:38:36.285 --> 00:38:41.535
Because they have seen all these things very
thoroughly and very closely and they knew

00:38:41.535 --> 00:38:45.159
what was it.

00:38:45.253 --> 00:38:56.243
Now when you become so cleaned, washed out
completely, mind completely cleaned out from

00:38:56.268 --> 00:39:06.195
all kinds of conditionings you see; you become
like a mirror, beautiful mirror.

00:39:06.195 --> 00:39:13.325
And in that mirror one can see complete picture
of the society in which you live, the complete

00:39:13.325 --> 00:39:18.583
picture of the government which rules you;
everything, so clear-cut.

00:39:18.608 --> 00:39:20.499
And it is absolute.

00:39:20.753 --> 00:39:22.484
It is not biased.

00:39:22.542 --> 00:39:27.307
For example you ask somebody, then he will
say, "What is your politics?"

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:32.853
If I say My politics is I have no politics,
say, "What you have no politics, how can we

00:39:32.878 --> 00:39:34.528
exist without politics?"

00:39:34.553 --> 00:39:36.173
I have no politics.

00:39:36.198 --> 00:39:45.040
So they will go on asking questions to you
which are very much unknown.

00:39:45.065 --> 00:39:49.688
But for a realized soul, it's just the other
way round.

00:39:49.713 --> 00:39:58.153
Hes not only sees, but also shows and expresses,
very clearly.

00:39:58.178 --> 00:40:08.718
I've been amazed at the way people have been
really so reflective of the society into which

00:40:08.743 --> 00:40:13.213
they live and the country which they represent.

00:40:13.238 --> 00:40:18.275
So the identification is lost, complete identification
is lost.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.294
You don't feel identified much.

00:40:20.331 --> 00:40:22.568
You just see what's wrong with that world.

00:40:22.661 --> 00:40:30.821
Then also another point is that you start
seeing how you can help, what you should do,

00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:33.271
how you can work it out.

00:40:33.271 --> 00:40:39.331
And the importance of that becomes your main
thing in life.

00:40:39.331 --> 00:40:44.991
Everybody I see, yesterday the way you brought
all this flags and all that, behind that flag,

00:40:44.991 --> 00:40:51.111
I could see, all of you wanted that peace
should prevail in those countries, they should

00:40:51.111 --> 00:40:55.221
get all the joy and beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:55.221 --> 00:40:57.281
It's what a feeling it is.

00:40:57.281 --> 00:41:02.741
It's not like yourself becoming Sahaja Yogis
and sitting in the corner, no.

00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:10.991
They want to do it for that country about
which they are not identified, but without

00:41:10.991 --> 00:41:17.981
identification, they have that deep feeling
that they have to work out; correct it.

00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:22.581
It's a very different type of personality
you develop.

00:41:22.581 --> 00:41:28.801
Normally you see if you say a word against
somebody that, "See in your country they do

00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:29.801
like this.."

00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:32.411
"Oh what you're talking, what about your country?"

00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:33.411
Immediately.

00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:35.291
They'll never accept.

00:41:35.291 --> 00:41:45.483
If you just try to even say one word against
them, their country or their government, which

00:41:45.508 --> 00:41:49.138
may be the most rotten government, but no
still, "What?

00:41:49.138 --> 00:41:51.848
We are all right."

00:41:51.848 --> 00:42:01.394
That kind of stupid identification, which
keeps you completely glued to that society;

00:42:01.449 --> 00:42:05.339
like some people will say, "No, no, I have
to go to the pub."

00:42:05.339 --> 00:42:07.029
I say, why?

00:42:07.029 --> 00:42:08.272
Why you have to go to the pub?

00:42:08.297 --> 00:42:10.753
"That's our society; that's our culture.

00:42:10.899 --> 00:42:11.899
We have to go.

00:42:11.899 --> 00:42:18.687
We have to go to the pub, get drunk and fall
down, all of us together.

00:42:18.781 --> 00:42:21.919
That's the sort of thing we are; we can't
help it you see.

00:42:21.944 --> 00:42:23.190
This is what it is."

00:42:23.215 --> 00:42:26.795
You tell anybody that, why do you do this
like this?

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.175
What is the need to do?

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:34.694
"Now, because I have to live in this society,
after all, after all I belong to this society

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.828
and I just can't do what I like."

00:42:38.853 --> 00:42:41.920
But when you get your realization, you can
do what you like.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:49.290
You can do what you like, because you only
like that is righteous, that is good, that

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.640
is constructive, that is helpful.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.300
So you can do whatever you like; after realization,
there's no restriction for you.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.150
All these restriction of, "don't, don't, don't,
don't" - these clearly enslave you.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.110
I think it very much enslaves you.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:11.090
But in after realization, you are such a free
bird that nothing can enslave you.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:16.140
For example, there are many preachers who
preach - you shouldn't drink, you should not

00:43:16.165 --> 00:43:21.854
smoke, this, shouldn't take drugs, you should
do this, you should do that -

00:43:21.879 --> 00:43:24.236
but it doesn't stop.

00:43:24.446 --> 00:43:25.711
It doesn't help.

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:31.649
People struggle, try everything, ultimately
they commit suicides, but they can't get rid

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:37.570
of those habits; while now you are so powerful
that nothing can stick to you.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:44.180
That's the purity of your character that has
come up; it doesn't allow any nonsensical

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.170
things to stick to you.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:53.520
I've heard of so many Sahaja Yogis telling
me, how their eyes have steadied down, how

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:59.710
they have become so righteous, how they have
become so pure and they can't understand.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:04.840
They said, "Mother is it Your power, Your
purity You have given us, or it is our purity

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.840
You have awakened?"

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.840
Of course yours.

00:44:06.868 --> 00:44:08.394
No doubt.

00:44:08.452 --> 00:44:17.381
All these things you have, and you become
aware of it, and thus you get absolutely misidentified

00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:22.801
I should say with all these nonsensical things,
and you don't like it.

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:25.161
You just don't like it.

00:44:25.161 --> 00:44:26.562
And you go on criticizing.

00:44:26.562 --> 00:44:35.462
I've been to all these countries also before,
and I have met people who are very much identified,

00:44:35.462 --> 00:44:41.742
and diplomatically I was not suppose to say
anything whatsoever that would make them feel

00:44:41.742 --> 00:44:44.562
that they are doing something wrong.

00:44:44.562 --> 00:44:50.962
But after Sahaja Yoga, the same people are
telling us and making fun of the whole thing.

00:44:50.962 --> 00:44:53.431
For example, I've heard some Sahaja Yogis
talking to each other.

00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:59.192
He says, "You see my country, this is so stupid
thing going on."

00:44:59.192 --> 00:45:04.412
Another one said, "Nobody can beat mine; it's
much worse."

00:45:04.412 --> 00:45:16.121
Is a very common competition among Sahaja
Yogis going on.

00:45:16.121 --> 00:45:33.571
So that we have to see how pure we have become,
and in this purity anything that is dirty,

00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:41.762
murky, anything that will spoil this purity;
we don't like it.

00:45:41.762 --> 00:45:44.202
We don't like it.

00:45:44.202 --> 00:45:50.762
We are washed, cleaned, from inside, and won't
want to take anything like that

00:45:50.787 --> 00:45:52.739
within us anymore.

00:45:54.453 --> 00:46:01.952
Then I've seen also, the way people have become
so compassionate.

00:46:01.952 --> 00:46:08.272
Is very surprising how they have become compassionate
to each other.

00:46:08.272 --> 00:46:16.722
For example, there were two Sahaja Yogis,
they were not very happy with each other,

00:46:16.722 --> 00:46:19.621
not compatible; whatever you say that is.

00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:25.742
And I didn't know how to make them feel that,
"You see the other Sahaja Yogi's all right;

00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:27.772
doesn't matter after all, what is."

00:46:27.772 --> 00:46:29.922
"No I don't like this thing in him."

00:46:29.922 --> 00:46:33.947
And the another one would say, "I don't like
this thing about him."

00:46:33.972 --> 00:46:38.017
So it went on: "I don't like," he says, "I
don't like."

00:46:38.042 --> 00:46:45.202
I mean they were seeing each other's defects
or whatever you may call them.

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:49.328
So I said, "All right now will you meditate
for some time?"

00:46:49.353 --> 00:46:52.826
Again, "Meditate, meditate."

00:46:53.922 --> 00:46:57.115
And I said, "Now, do you love me?"

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:01.719
She said I, one says, "I love You more than
he loves."

00:47:03.162 --> 00:47:08.222
I said, "Is difficult situation."

00:47:08.222 --> 00:47:19.960
How to make them understand now that you cannot
weigh your love; you cannot make a

00:47:19.985 --> 00:47:21.655
chart out of it.

00:47:21.684 --> 00:47:29.942
It is something within yourself, and if you
love somebody then you enjoy it.

00:47:29.942 --> 00:47:33.578
I mean you cannot qualify it; you cannot quantify
it.

00:47:33.603 --> 00:47:42.013
But this was going on with these two gentlemen
together, and I thought, "Now what to do?"

00:47:42.162 --> 00:47:48.286
They are very important, and still there's
no understanding between the two.

00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:52.821
So the Divine Power took over I think.

00:47:52.846 --> 00:47:57.459
One of them fell very sick suddenly, very
sick.

00:47:57.484 --> 00:48:03.734
And I had sent word also that, "You'll be
sick; be careful."

00:48:03.759 --> 00:48:12.144
But it was I mean they thought that the other
fellow might be trying to be funny or something;

00:48:12.571 --> 00:48:13.902
it was not understood.

00:48:13.902 --> 00:48:14.902
He was very sick.

00:48:14.902 --> 00:48:25.750
When he fell sick, then this one, the another
one, felt such tremendous love for him.

00:48:25.775 --> 00:48:35.010
It's something, nobody can explain, that he
went and sat with that patient for 24 hours,

00:48:36.402 --> 00:48:41.602
and said that, "If you need any money, I have
got."

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:47.391
He paid for wherever he could pay.

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:56.802
So this gentleman also was very sensible,
reasonable person on his own - felt this love,

00:48:56.802 --> 00:49:02.644
this affection, in this hard taskmaster, the
other one - and such understanding

00:49:02.669 --> 00:49:04.614
 grew up within them.

00:49:05.301 --> 00:49:15.211
It is I think, is the Divine's Play that they
were brought together, so close and such compassion.

00:49:15.236 --> 00:49:22.767
So the force of compassion within you is so
much, it's very subtle; you don't see.

00:49:22.792 --> 00:49:31.332
Because on mental level - I was telling them,
arguing, trying to pacify him, pacify him;

00:49:31.357 --> 00:49:34.688
like that was on - it would not work out.

00:49:34.713 --> 00:49:46.967
But when this force of compassion started
acting suddenly into one of them, the another

00:49:46.992 --> 00:49:58.967
one saw the compassion, the pure compassion,
and just they became great friends.

00:49:58.992 --> 00:50:04.982
So one has to feel the compassion within yourself.

00:50:05.078 --> 00:50:15.677
I've seen many a times that there are many
Sahaja Yogis and sometimes I have to correct

00:50:15.702 --> 00:50:17.112
them, or say something.

00:50:17.137 --> 00:50:23.861
Immediately, another one will say, "Mother
can You forgive him, You can't forgive?"

00:50:23.886 --> 00:50:24.968
I say I have forgiven.

00:50:24.993 --> 00:50:26.902
I am not doing anything.

00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:29.391
"Please forgive, please."

00:50:30.301 --> 00:50:42.881
I feel so happy to hear that, that in one
point, in one condition, when it comes to

00:50:42.881 --> 00:50:48.656
Sahaja Yogi, you support him, even against
Me; I feel happy.

00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:57.291
Shows that you are not only generous, but
you are filled with your compassion.

00:50:57.291 --> 00:51:06.871
So this source of compassion which is within
your being, in your heart, you have to just

00:51:06.871 --> 00:51:08.341
open your heart.

00:51:08.341 --> 00:51:13.722
If you open that heart, it's like opening
the Sahasrara.

00:51:13.722 --> 00:51:20.763
You'll be amazed how you can forgive people
and you can live with them.

00:51:20.788 --> 00:51:27.531
I've reports which disturbs Me many a times
that people are forming different groups,

00:51:27.531 --> 00:51:33.493
and having different ashrams, and they don't
come to the collective, and all that.

00:51:33.518 --> 00:51:35.605
I feel very much concerned.

00:51:35.706 --> 00:51:41.967
Now what is missing is, of course, there are
also some people who think that they must

00:51:41.992 --> 00:51:44.956
have a separate, their own organization, and

00:51:44.981 --> 00:51:47.504
why should they be in the collective, and all that.

00:51:47.529 --> 00:51:59.575
So that it is definite, that such a person
has not yet achieved that state of compassion.

00:51:59.799 --> 00:52:12.541
In the state of compassion, you like that
somebody tells you that, "Don't say anything

00:52:12.541 --> 00:52:14.811
to such and such person.

00:52:14.811 --> 00:52:16.912
I don't want you to say this."

00:52:16.912 --> 00:52:20.262
It's very, very joy giving to Me.

00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:25.021
Like we had one couple, they were quarrelling
throughout.

00:52:25.021 --> 00:52:27.861
They used to send Me letters after letters.

00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:34.742
Ah baba, was fed up; telephones after telephones,
both of them quarrelling.

00:52:34.742 --> 00:52:41.851
Quarrelling so much, I didn't know what to
do with them.

00:52:41.851 --> 00:52:47.841
So, I thought that it's better that they divorce
and finish it off.

00:52:47.841 --> 00:53:00.192
And I told them, separately, that, "You better
divorce each other and get out of it, but

00:53:00.192 --> 00:53:04.881
the complaints you have are such that they
cannot be solved."

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:05.881
Said, "How?"

00:53:05.881 --> 00:53:14.702
I said, "You are saying that my husband doesn't
give me more time, he is always out, and he

00:53:14.702 --> 00:53:19.497
doesn't spend any nice moments with me, we
don't go out

00:53:19.522 --> 00:53:21.683
 and all these complaints are there.

00:53:22.374 --> 00:53:26.861
And the husband says that, she always troubles
me that I must take her out, and I must do

00:53:26.861 --> 00:53:28.871
this, and I must do that.

00:53:28.871 --> 00:53:30.742
I want to do it but I can't do it."

00:53:30.742 --> 00:53:35.112
So I said, "But when you take a divorce, you'll
never, can claim anything.

00:53:35.112 --> 00:53:38.412
Permanently, the husband is lost and you are
lost.

00:53:38.412 --> 00:53:40.601
So why do you want to do such a thing?"

00:53:40.601 --> 00:53:49.551
Immediately, know this compassion started
working, and then I put in a word, "Supposing

00:53:49.686 --> 00:53:56.042
any one of you is sick tomorrow, then who
will look after each other?"

00:53:56.042 --> 00:53:58.443
This just put them out.

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:06.402
You know such little, little moments in life,
come in, in the life of Sahaja Yogis I've

00:54:06.402 --> 00:54:15.922
seen, that suddenly this heart opens, and
with that - they combat all these petty, nonsensical,

00:54:15.922 --> 00:54:21.727
ideas which keeps them out; out of each other
and out of the collectivity.

00:54:21.872 --> 00:54:29.722
What gives me the greatest enjoyment is to
see how you love each other, care for each

00:54:29.722 --> 00:54:33.987
other, joke with each other and dance with
each other.

00:54:34.045 --> 00:54:37.361
This is the greatest thing that I enjoy.

00:54:37.386 --> 00:54:41.541
I don't want to get rid of this idea of Mine.

00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:48.641
Despite the fact, so many times I find it's
hard to believe how could Sahaja Yogis behave

00:54:48.641 --> 00:54:59.695
like this, and try to create rifts, and distances
between the people who are realized souls.

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:07.360
Because realized souls anywhere in the world,
you should see them, they respect each other.

00:55:07.385 --> 00:55:14.139
Not only respect, cared and never talked ill
of another realized soul.

00:55:14.164 --> 00:55:15.164
Never.

00:55:15.793 --> 00:55:20.564
I don't know if you have known about the private
lives of these saints.

00:55:20.702 --> 00:55:27.871
But in India as we have had so many of them,
when you see them - how they have behaved

00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:37.861
towards each other, the way they have looked
after each other - it's so beautiful; it's

00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:39.081
so noble.

00:55:39.081 --> 00:55:47.502
As if they care for the other Sahaja Yogi,
or yogi, or a realized soul, than for themselves.

00:55:47.502 --> 00:56:01.222
And the whole thing makes you feel like in
a new world, of new people, who care for the

00:56:01.222 --> 00:56:07.540
feelings of others, and not - what they want
to say, or what they want to have, or they

00:56:07.565 --> 00:56:10.155
are something special.

00:56:10.912 --> 00:56:18.311
Also in Sahaja Yoga, you have come; you have
lost your specialities.

00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:23.110
Some of them think they're very special.

00:56:23.167 --> 00:56:33.742
Supposing I call some lady to put say alta
on My Feet, she starts thinking she is very

00:56:33.742 --> 00:56:38.316
special, but I just call her because I know
she has a horrible agnya and

00:56:38.341 --> 00:56:40.348
I have to clear it out.

00:56:45.196 --> 00:56:50.205
And when somebody told Me, "Mother she thinks
something very special," I said, "Really,

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:51.766
what makes her think like that?"

00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:56.141
"Because You call her to put some alta on
Your Feet."

00:56:56.141 --> 00:57:02.916
I said I just called her that she has such
a horrid, ugly, agnya that she will trouble

00:57:02.941 --> 00:57:07.241
everyone, so I want to clear it.

00:57:08.017 --> 00:57:16.904
So, either I should have told her that you
are a very egoistical, horrible and all the

00:57:16.929 --> 00:57:21.810
words that are possible, otherwise she won't
understand.

00:57:21.835 --> 00:57:23.635
It's so surprising.

00:57:24.081 --> 00:57:32.551
There is one lady who was really very nasty
to her in-laws and everybody in India, and

00:57:32.551 --> 00:57:33.851
she came to see Me.

00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:35.582
I called her.

00:57:35.582 --> 00:57:37.781
I actually scolded her.

00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:41.081
I said, "What business you had to behave like
this here?

00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:45.692
Your father who was such a racist, you never
said a word against him, and why are you talking

00:57:45.692 --> 00:57:47.581
so much against these people?"

00:57:47.581 --> 00:57:48.722
I scolded her.

00:57:48.722 --> 00:57:53.978
She went out and told, "Oh look at Mother
has called me; nobody is allowed to see Her."

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.846
I said, "What's this?"

00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:05.301
It's a very funny situation with people I
sometimes feel the way they think they're

00:58:05.301 --> 00:58:08.172
something special, and they should make themselves
special.

00:58:08.172 --> 00:58:11.422
It is becoming really difficult.

00:58:11.422 --> 00:58:24.242
Now just to show My love, to appreciate something
people have done, and if you give some present

00:58:24.242 --> 00:58:31.831
to that person, or you show concern about
that person, because he's done some good work

00:58:31.831 --> 00:58:36.771
or something, he starts thinking he's something
special.

00:58:36.771 --> 00:58:46.022
I mean is an impossible situation, because
I expect that if I have done anything good

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:54.871
to that person, or in any way suggested My
concern about a person - that person has to

00:58:54.871 --> 00:59:04.222
become a very good Sahaja Yogi; in the sense
the most humble, and honest, and loving person.

00:59:04.222 --> 00:59:07.871
Otherwise it has no meaning.

00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:15.752
No use being good to anyone if that means
that person jumps into hell.

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:33.351
So this one is also another idea of speciality,
that they have lost their sense of speciality.

00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:43.041
When a drop becomes the ocean, it has become
the ocean, but it's not the drop anymore.

00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:49.432
If anybody thinks, "I am a special person,"
then know that you are no more an ocean; you

00:59:49.432 --> 00:59:51.391
are still the drop.

00:59:51.391 --> 00:59:58.408
Because unless and until you are the drop,
how can you feel that "I am something special"?

00:59:58.552 --> 01:00:02.903
So you have lost your speciality.

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:11.673
You have lost it, because all these ideas
of speciality comes from your past.

01:00:11.673 --> 01:00:21.393
One lady I met once, long time back, she was
a very rude, proud, arrogant woman.

01:00:21.393 --> 01:00:27.062
So this was in Delhi, where people are very
conscious of their husband's jobs, and this

01:00:27.062 --> 01:00:29.423
and that.

01:00:29.423 --> 01:00:37.164
I didn't even know the destination, or even
the designation of My husband.

01:00:37.777 --> 01:00:41.723
So she was very rude to Me.

01:00:41.723 --> 01:00:46.720
I said what's the matter with you, why are
you so rude, what's the problem?

01:00:46.751 --> 01:00:48.310
She said, "You don't know?

01:00:48.335 --> 01:00:51.795
I'm the wife of such and such."

01:00:51.879 --> 01:00:56.618
You're the wife or the husband?

01:00:56.643 --> 01:01:01.230
"I'm the wife of such and such."

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:05.650
So she asked Me, "What are you doing here?"

01:01:05.675 --> 01:01:07.869
I said, "I am a housewife."

01:01:11.512 --> 01:01:15.276
Then My husband came.

01:01:15.513 --> 01:01:17.077
She said, "Do you know him?"

01:01:17.102 --> 01:01:19.589
I said, "Yes I know, why?"

01:01:22.503 --> 01:01:26.833
I thought there must be something wrong there
also.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:33.338
So she said, "No I just want to know.

01:01:33.363 --> 01:01:36.952
How do you know him?"

01:01:36.977 --> 01:01:40.527
As if I was some criminal or what?

01:01:40.891 --> 01:01:42.623
I said, "He's My husband."

01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:45.978
"Oh my God, he's your husband?"

01:01:46.104 --> 01:01:47.484
What happened?

01:01:47.715 --> 01:01:52.525
As if ten serpents had bitten her.

01:01:53.709 --> 01:02:00.919
Maybe, maybe her husband was at a much lower
position than my husband, maybe something

01:02:00.919 --> 01:02:03.289
which I am not conscious of it.

01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:11.314
But this is what is "I'm something special."

01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:20.160
This stupid idea of being special has to be
completely negated in Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:20.216 --> 01:02:21.423
Not mentally.

01:02:21.495 --> 01:02:22.535
Not mentally.

01:02:22.845 --> 01:02:33.734
Mentally if you're again saying, "I'm not
special, I'm not special," like a mantra,

01:02:34.505 --> 01:02:38.931
you'll become much more.

01:02:38.974 --> 01:02:45.802
Because you'll say, "I've said this mantra
23,000 times.

01:02:46.322 --> 01:02:51.986
Who can say like me?"

01:02:54.664 --> 01:03:00.942
So this idea - I'm something special, I'm
something great, I'm something out of the

01:03:00.967 --> 01:03:08.986
blue, something superior to others - just
vanishes.

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:15.072
Like as I said, you are a drop in the sea.

01:03:15.097 --> 01:03:23.860
You have become the ocean, but you are no
more a drop, to have any relative value system.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.409
There's no relative value system.

01:03:26.409 --> 01:03:34.479
There is no system by which you can say that
I'm higher or he's lower; all that has created

01:03:34.479 --> 01:03:37.640
all the problems of the world.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:45.496
See from our caste system in India, the social
systems in the West, the racialism in the

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:56.239
West, also self consciousness of "my religion
is better, yours is worst, we are the best"

01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:59.539
- all these things have created problems.

01:03:59.539 --> 01:04:02.070
It has done no good.

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:04.879
It has failed and failed and failed.

01:04:04.904 --> 01:04:12.452
So in Sahaja Yoga at least don't bring this
disease anymore - that, "I'm better, we, our

01:04:12.477 --> 01:04:14.112
country's better..."

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:24.449
This speciality you should drop, and real
beauty of your personality will show.

01:04:24.449 --> 01:04:31.229
For that you don't need a special scale, you
don't need a special body, you don't need

01:04:31.229 --> 01:04:36.769
a special, what you can call, a glamorous
look.

01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:39.333
What you need is a beautiful heart.

01:04:39.358 --> 01:04:46.275
And I tell you, it's the beautiful heart that
attracts; nothing else.

01:04:46.368 --> 01:04:49.566
It's the beautiful heart that you want to
have.

01:04:49.602 --> 01:04:55.441
I've known people nay many like that.

01:04:55.466 --> 01:04:58.906
There was one gentleman who divorced his first
wife.

01:04:59.279 --> 01:05:03.616
She maybe not be so good looking, maybe ugly,
or whatever it was.

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:10.880
Then he married another good-looking woman,
and he ran away from the house.

01:05:10.905 --> 01:05:12.504
So I asked him why.

01:05:12.529 --> 01:05:17.873
You didn't like that woman because she was
ugly or whatever it was, so why have you now

01:05:17.898 --> 01:05:19.609
running away from this one?

01:05:19.718 --> 01:05:21.323
"She has no heart.

01:05:23.639 --> 01:05:27.502
She has no heart."

01:05:27.527 --> 01:05:36.655
And this is what you have - a very great,
generous, beautiful, dharmic heart.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:45.810
You have got it as a present from the Divine,
and which you must respect.

01:05:45.835 --> 01:05:56.917
Should be proud of it, and enjoy it, as you
should enjoy your generosity.

01:05:56.942 --> 01:06:03.021
You should enjoy the way all this nature is
enjoying itself.

01:06:04.337 --> 01:06:11.228
To be very meticulous about things, to be
all the time correcting others, is a headache.

01:06:11.457 --> 01:06:13.970
It's a headache.

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:19.448
The best thing is to correct yourself, and
laugh at yourself; that's the best way you

01:06:19.473 --> 01:06:20.473
can do it.

01:06:20.836 --> 01:06:25.237
Everybody has some funny things about themselves.

01:06:25.641 --> 01:06:29.125
I also have; I must confess.

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:34.999
And I enjoy them because I think I try and
try, but always I forget.

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:38.715
For example spectacles, I always forget them.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.227
Before coming see I must always forget it.

01:06:42.252 --> 01:06:48.914
I tell Myself that I need it, I should take
it, must remember; but invariably I forget,

01:06:48.939 --> 01:06:52.289
and I don't know why.

01:06:52.289 --> 01:06:56.804
I, I, I can't do without it, but still I forget.

01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:58.581
There's so many things.

01:06:58.812 --> 01:07:01.891
For example, I don't know how to count money.

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:05.946
If you may give me 100 rupees, I'll count
it 200 rupees.

01:07:06.563 --> 01:07:10.831
I tell you I, I'm good at mathematics, but
I can't count.

01:07:10.856 --> 01:07:13.538
I don't know how to sign a check; can you
believe it?

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:14.563
I can't sign.

01:07:14.703 --> 01:07:18.133
You have to write the check for Me, otherwise
I can't.

01:07:18.158 --> 01:07:26.738
And somebody asks Me say for say 100 rupees;
I'll give him a big 500 and forget about it.

01:07:26.915 --> 01:07:29.014
And that person says, "Mother You gave me
500."

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:30.876
No, no, no, I gave you 100 only.

01:07:30.901 --> 01:07:32.809
"No, You gave me 500."

01:07:32.834 --> 01:07:34.400
I went home and found out.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:35.251
It's all right.

01:07:35.338 --> 01:07:40.261
After all, if he's dishonest - he's dishonest;
if he's honest - he's honest.

01:07:40.286 --> 01:07:46.066
So why to worry about how much money you gave,
and this thing, that thing, meticulously you

01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:48.849
see, finding everything like this?

01:07:48.874 --> 01:07:53.059
And I've seen with all these meticulous people,
they always fail.

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:56.969
Because you see this brain plays some tricks
on them.

01:07:56.969 --> 01:08:00.757
For example, there was one fellow who told
Me that,

01:08:00.782 --> 01:08:03.473
 "The size of your car is such and such."

01:08:03.498 --> 01:08:04.498
All right then.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.272
"So the size of the garage will be such and
such."

01:08:08.297 --> 01:08:09.909
I said all right.

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:14.205
So, when we build the garage, the car won't
get in.

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:27.431
I said such a meticulous architect, and such
a well-known person who has got so many awards,

01:08:27.456 --> 01:08:30.835
this, that - how could he make such a mistake?

01:08:30.994 --> 01:08:33.471
But I still didn't understand it you see.

01:08:33.496 --> 01:08:36.709
Now he said, "Now you better buy a smaller
car."

01:08:41.111 --> 01:08:47.694
I said at least now you measure this garage
in a proper way, otherwise again if I buy

01:08:47.719 --> 01:08:50.006
something it won't enter in.

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:55.079
So you see what I'm saying, we are so particular,
so meticulous.

01:08:55.104 --> 01:08:59.855
Now see these little, little flowers I see
them here; they're not meticulous.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.451
They are growing on their own freely, everybody
gets the sun's rays, and they're quite happy.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:13.133
But the way we are particular, those people
are very particular, are headaches to themselves.

01:09:13.158 --> 01:09:16.677
And then ultimately they find that it's not
so.

01:09:16.702 --> 01:09:19.593
You have lost that; you have lost that meticulousness.

01:09:19.618 --> 01:09:25.719
I know of a Sahaj Yogini; she was running
a shop, and she said, "Mother I knew each

01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:29.887
and everything, and I knew each and every
price, and everything I knew in this shop,

01:09:29.912 --> 01:09:33.734
but since I've got realization; I've forgotten
everything."

01:09:34.251 --> 01:09:36.959
So are you happy or unhappy?

01:09:36.984 --> 01:09:38.353
"I'm very happy."

01:09:38.378 --> 01:09:39.146
Why?

01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:42.483
"Because now I'm making a big profit."

01:09:42.535 --> 01:09:44.077
Profit is the main thing.

01:09:44.102 --> 01:09:46.992
Why should you try to remember each and every
thing?

01:09:47.017 --> 01:09:56.039
So it is to be very meticulous, to be very
systematic, very, world is, if you see around

01:09:56.039 --> 01:09:57.718
- no tree is systematic.

01:09:57.743 --> 01:10:00.803
It is unsystematically systematic.

01:10:01.223 --> 01:10:07.097
Some leaves are this side, some are that side;
some branches are on that side.

01:10:07.122 --> 01:10:14.519
There's no system, because then you become
a military, if you form a system.

01:10:14.519 --> 01:10:16.931
So in Sahaja Yoga there is no system.

01:10:16.956 --> 01:10:19.065
We are beyond time.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:24.567
We are beyond all kinds of systems; we have
no system.

01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:29.933
All of our system is, "What is the unigion
within ourselves?"

01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:36.763
Like these two hands, they have no system
built in nothing, but they move.

01:10:36.788 --> 01:10:42.897
Especially Italy if you want, both the hands
move like that all the time in Italy.

01:10:42.922 --> 01:10:48.049
And I don't know what it means, but they all
do the same thing.

01:10:48.579 --> 01:10:50.034
There's no system built in.

01:10:50.059 --> 01:10:53.344
Nobody said them that do these gestures and
all that.

01:10:53.369 --> 01:10:59.649
But they do it, and do it naturally, all of
them together - without any system.

01:10:59.916 --> 01:11:07.275
So to build up mental systems is wrong and
against Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:12.229
Some people have written to Me, "Mother we
want to translate your transcriptions, do

01:11:12.254 --> 01:11:13.785
this, do that" and plans.

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:14.795
I said forget it.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.322
Forget.

01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:23.860
Because if you start planning you see, you
will definitely, definitely fall into the

01:11:23.885 --> 01:11:27.175
trap of systems.

01:11:27.474 --> 01:11:31.760
You'll have to follow systems; this system
is good, that system is good.

01:11:31.785 --> 01:11:33.008
Why not have this way?

01:11:33.033 --> 01:11:38.941
And because I don't, I don't say that it's
wrong, because you have been used to systems.

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:47.572
Especially in the West people have over systematic,
over systematic, in everything.

01:11:47.597 --> 01:11:54.357
Like they'll have courses you see built up,
then the spoons, then the forks, then the

01:11:54.382 --> 01:11:59.059
how to move, and what to eat, and how to eat.

01:11:59.084 --> 01:12:00.529
I mean it is too much.

01:12:01.888 --> 01:12:07.059
If you have to eat food, it's straightforward;
you can eat it with your hands.

01:12:07.985 --> 01:12:09.519
No system needed.

01:12:09.544 --> 01:12:16.287
For all these systems and norms are too much
in the West, and you should really try to

01:12:16.312 --> 01:12:17.341
them curb down.

01:12:18.385 --> 01:12:25.181
As a result they had anti-culture and all
that nonsense; another kind of stupidity where

01:12:25.206 --> 01:12:28.714
they were building up another kind of a system.

01:12:28.901 --> 01:12:31.676
See then they said, "We are hippies now."

01:12:31.701 --> 01:12:32.463
All right.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:38.893
So they must have hair never washed, never
clean with lice in their heads, and must be

01:12:38.918 --> 01:12:44.654
all like, you can say, the shankara style
you see.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.282
So all of them have to have that.

01:12:48.307 --> 01:12:49.430
Again system.

01:12:51.002 --> 01:12:54.703
There's no variety; one hippie means another
the same.

01:12:54.728 --> 01:12:57.309
You cannot make them out one from another.

01:12:57.309 --> 01:13:00.688
If somebody puts say a ring here - everybody
will put.

01:13:00.688 --> 01:13:07.478
If he puts a ring here - everybody will put;
without any brains, without any understanding.

01:13:07.478 --> 01:13:13.000
And they talk of individuality; of personality
-where is the individuality?

01:13:13.025 --> 01:13:21.663
There's no individuality, because you take
to anything that your gang, you can call,

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:28.269
or you can call the crowds that take it, very
fashionable.

01:13:28.269 --> 01:13:36.999
In India if you say if it is very fashionable,
it means it is very expensive, and very beautiful

01:13:36.999 --> 01:13:43.999
and is, I mean is very elite, elite word.

01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:48.279
But when I said, "This is very fashionable,"
means everybody likes it.

01:13:48.279 --> 01:13:52.728
It could be punky thing or anything, it's
fashionable.

01:13:52.753 --> 01:13:53.753
Finished.

01:13:53.925 --> 01:13:55.033
It's the fashion.

01:13:55.058 --> 01:14:03.177
Means you do not have your own idea, your
own personality, your own individuality.

01:14:03.311 --> 01:14:11.764
In Sahaja Yoga, you too are not bound to any
fashion, no fashion.

01:14:11.789 --> 01:14:15.146
If like; wear this, wear that, whatever you
like.

01:14:15.171 --> 01:14:22.437
If you fit do what you like, you can wear
whatever you like, but you, as I said again

01:14:22.437 --> 01:14:27.080
that you will govern yourself, you'll be your
own guru, you'll be your own master, and you'll

01:14:27.105 --> 01:14:36.156
do whatever is good, whatever is decent, whatever
the Deities will like, will just do it that

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:40.122
way because now you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:14:40.147 --> 01:14:44.329
So the life becomes so much easier, so much
easier.

01:14:44.476 --> 01:14:50.405
You don't worry about things which are not
there, and you are not also worried about

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:52.384
the things which are there.

01:14:52.409 --> 01:14:58.931
Because you think now, you see something,
all right I have got these knives now; I must

01:14:58.956 --> 01:15:02.389
keep this one for somebody.

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:04.224
I must give it to someone.

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:07.199
So I got a ring which was quite big.

01:15:07.281 --> 01:15:11.670
Was thinking whom should I give this; who
has got thick fingers?

01:15:11.695 --> 01:15:17.346
So I started looking at the fingers of everyone
you see, whosoever has a thick finger I'll

01:15:17.371 --> 01:15:18.768
give him this one.

01:15:18.793 --> 01:15:21.608
I mean the thought was just the other way
around.

01:15:21.633 --> 01:15:26.570
Supposing you are not a Sahaja Yogi then you'll
say, "Oh Ma, such a big thick finger, why

01:15:26.595 --> 01:15:29.267
not take out some gold and use it, sell it
off?"

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:36.050
Or else you see, "You can take out the stone
from here."

01:15:36.075 --> 01:15:41.216
I mean all kinds of nonsensical things you'll
think, but you'll not think that you better

01:15:41.241 --> 01:15:44.506
give it to somebody because you can't wear
it; it's too big for you.

01:15:44.531 --> 01:15:46.706
Why not give it to other?

01:15:46.731 --> 01:15:47.997
What's wrong?

01:15:48.022 --> 01:15:52.512
After all, it is not fitting you, so give
it to other.

01:15:52.624 --> 01:15:55.175
But this is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:55.275 --> 01:16:06.675
I've seen people, very kind, very, very kind
people who have been very sweet to each other

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:12.981
and exactly what the other person wants, they'll
buy and give it to that person.

01:16:13.142 --> 01:16:17.154
Or may say, oh no I have one, I'll give it
to you.

01:16:17.295 --> 01:16:19.495
They do it like that.

01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:23.318
It's all the time thinking about others.

01:16:23.722 --> 01:16:25.456
What should I give?

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:27.050
What should I do?

01:16:28.197 --> 01:16:32.456
It's the expression of that joy, the compassion
within you.

01:16:32.596 --> 01:16:38.778
You use your matter for that, all the time,
all the time.

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:42.943
Like somebody's house was burgled in Canada.

01:16:43.998 --> 01:16:48.287
So she writes to Me, "Thank God my house is
cleaned out now, I didn't know what to do

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:49.465
with it - the junk".

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:56.003
So you see this kind of an attitude comes
in that if you have to do, give to someone,

01:16:56.028 --> 01:17:02.980
then give it to someone who is a Sahaja Yogi
to express your love.

01:17:03.005 --> 01:17:08.853
But normally people will do whatever is the
junk in the house, you see whatever is rotten,

01:17:08.878 --> 01:17:11.425
finished, that they will give as a present.

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:17.079
But when you are a Sahaja Yogi you want to
give something really very special, because

01:17:17.104 --> 01:17:25.714
the whole being has become so beautiful - just
like a flower I should say which wants to

01:17:25.977 --> 01:17:31.463
give fragrance to others; all the time the
fragrance of your compassion and love, affection

01:17:31.488 --> 01:17:33.717
and security.

01:17:34.877 --> 01:17:45.088
It's a new age, that what they say, but I
would say it's a new human beings that are

01:17:45.113 --> 01:17:46.722
before Me.

01:17:46.747 --> 01:17:54.897
And all this newness has so many beautiful
facets that they really sparkle like diamonds,

01:17:54.922 --> 01:17:58.195
no doubt about it.

01:17:58.894 --> 01:18:11.845
My only blessings to you is that you grow
in it and grow in it and become greater and

01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:18.309
greater people; never thinking that you are
better than others; never thinking that you

01:18:18.334 --> 01:18:19.985
are special than others.

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:24.031
This will definitely soothe you down completely.

01:18:24.056 --> 01:18:27.100
Somebody might have hurt you somewhere, doesn't
matter.

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:29.914
Somebody must have scolded you, doesn't matter.

01:18:29.964 --> 01:18:37.384
What is your capacity is to - love another
person, and to be affectionate and kind.

01:18:38.387 --> 01:18:48.068
I'm really amazed how these 25 years have
passed with all kinds of stupid problems,

01:18:48.068 --> 01:18:51.475
and nice things and - such a mixture.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:58.020
And all those things have never disturbed
Me; I was never disturbed.

01:18:58.243 --> 01:19:04.532
I used to act sometimes that I am angry, or
sometimes I used to say things which I should

01:19:04.557 --> 01:19:09.443
not have normally said, because it was needed
to be said.

01:19:09.468 --> 01:19:22.132
But, on the whole, like sitting in a very
big ship you can say, we all are elevated

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:26.253
into the realm of Divine Love.

01:19:26.278 --> 01:19:29.377
And this is what one has to enjoy.

01:19:29.402 --> 01:19:38.557
One person if he has that love and compassion,
and that pure love, then that person can emit

01:19:38.582 --> 01:19:47.929
it to others, and the record of this compassion
is extremely beautiful; which cannot be described

01:19:47.954 --> 01:19:48.932
in words.

01:19:48.957 --> 01:19:51.526
Like yesterday I couldn't speak.

01:19:51.551 --> 01:19:55.656
In what words I could put My feelings?

01:19:55.681 --> 01:20:05.645
I thought there are no words yet created on
this earth to express My deep feeling that

01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:12.673
how you people have taken Sahaja Yoga so well
and have understood it.

01:20:12.926 --> 01:20:13.926
May God bless you all.

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:35.798
Sahasrara Puja is a short one.

01:20:36.307 --> 01:20:45.329
We don't have a very long puja for Sahasrara,
because you know Sahasrara breaks in no time.

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:54.999
So it's not a very long puja, but it's very
deep, and again ultimately the last chakra

01:20:55.024 --> 01:20:59.121
which is opened out is here, is the heart.

01:20:59.402 --> 01:21:07.403
So in the Sahasrara Puja our hearts open out,
that's the main thing, and that is what one

01:21:07.428 --> 01:21:11.099
has to enjoy, opening of your heart.

01:21:11.702 --> 01:21:19.297
Don't worry about any Deities, about any rituals,
any this and that, but just open your heart.

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:25.062
We are not bound by anything; just open your
heart.
