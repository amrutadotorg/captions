00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:17.740
In Sahaja Yoga also we go step by step.

00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:24.930
First of all we have to know our Spirit,

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:34.076
not through mental projection but
with a spontaneous happening,

00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:38.262
which is a living happening.

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:44.348
The thing that human beings cannot do.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:50.189
Now what is that living process?

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:57.972
Whatever I am telling you could be
a mental projection of mind, again.

00:01:00.563 --> 00:01:10.288
So you must take My words as a hypothesis
would be there for a scientist,

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.525
with an open mind.

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:25.312
And if it happens to you, then you have
to take it as a law.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.921
Now I say that within us lie these seven
subtle centres.

00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.064
Some may say that it is not said in this
book or that book;

00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:48.011
forget about everything now.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.563
There are these seven centres, which reside
within us,

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:05.799
some in the medulla oblongata,

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:10.789
and some in the brain.

00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:16.695
Now these centres manifest outside,
these subtle centres,

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:22.890
the gross plexuses about which doctors
know.

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:35.951
These centres also control our endocrine
systems.

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:45.055
They have a much deeper significance
than the plexuses,

00:02:45.256 --> 00:02:51.030
which are only manifesting on a physical
level.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:03:03.448
These centres also cater to our emotional
being.

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:18.107
They also cater to our mental being,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:25.408
and they also cater to our spiritual being.

00:03:25.624 --> 00:03:28.718
So whatever condition we are in,

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:35.451
it is due to the condition of these subtle
centres within us.

00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:46.431
These subtle centres that are placed
within us, you can’t see with naked eyes

00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:52.381
or through any human machinery.

00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:02.582
They are energy centres

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.628
and made of three types of energy
within us,

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:13.800
about which I’ll tell you tomorrow.

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:17.593
But today we have to know that there are
such centres within us

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.360
and the most important thing is that
within us lies another third power,

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:29.737
which we call as Kundalini in Sanskrit
language.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.375
Now this Kundalini has nothing to do
from what place you come,

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:49.306
country you come or whatever language
you follow.

00:04:54.244 --> 00:05:00.398
It is called Kundalini because kundal
means 'coil'.

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:08.945
This is an energy within us.

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:14.029
This is the energy of desire,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.282
desire which is pure desire.

00:05:20.594 --> 00:05:24.162
We have so many desires.

00:05:24.363 --> 00:05:27.586
We want to have a house,

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:32.549
then when we get out we want to have a car,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.745
when we have a car we want to have
a helicopter.

00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:41.458
So as you understand economics,

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:46.366
that wants are not satiable in general.

00:05:53.795 --> 00:06:03.337
Now actually when this desire, which is
the pure desire, is awakened,

00:06:03.538 --> 00:06:07.693
you get your absolute desire fulfilled,

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:16.215
and the absolute desire is to become one
with the whole.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:40.129
This desire is to become one with
the Divine.

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:44.808
This Divine Power, I call It Divine,
you may not call it Divine,

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.545
but it is an All-Pervading Power.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.936
We come in the garden and see so many
flowers; we take it for granted.

00:07:13.154 --> 00:07:20.092
And when we see the flowers becoming fruits
we take it for granted.

00:07:24.233 --> 00:07:28.379
How they have become fruits?

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:40.288
Can we transform a flower into a fruit?
We cannot.

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:45.540
But somebody, some energy has done it.

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:51.721
That must be the energy all-pervading
everywhere.

00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:57.431
And remarkably it has such a nice
discretion,

00:07:57.632 --> 00:08:03.742
for example a mango tree will only produce
mango, not apples.

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:17.661
So this energy which is doing all
the living work of the world,

00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:25.345
all the autonomous work within our body
itself,

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:32.892
which has made us human beings from amoeba,

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:41.058
this Power we have never felt before.

00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:45.114
So when you get your Self-Realisation,

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:50.776
for the first time you feel that Power,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.634
that All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:09:03.912 --> 00:09:08.731
This you cannot feel otherwise.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.683
It is very easy to believe into something
false.

00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:22.699
We believe more into false than
into reality.

00:09:23.991 --> 00:09:28.680
That appeals to us much more.

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:36.793
But reality is the one we should try
to achieve.

00:09:39.214 --> 00:09:43.267
If we have to feel this breeze, or this

00:09:43.468 --> 00:09:49.631
'breeze of the Holy Ghost' as they call it,
then what are we to do?

00:09:55.349 --> 00:10:00.563
Some people think that we should go
for a fasting or vegetarian food

00:10:00.764 --> 00:10:05.910
or starve ourselves, or kill ourselves.

00:10:16.489 --> 00:10:23.946
Such people only can become thin and die,
or become mad at the most.

00:10:33.548 --> 00:10:38.206
There is no need to torture yourself.

00:10:40.008 --> 00:10:46.073
This human body is made with great
understanding.

00:10:48.912 --> 00:10:54.026
It is beautifully, delicately made.

00:10:56.548 --> 00:11:00.960
It is made with great care,

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.879
with a very special purpose,

00:11:06.545 --> 00:11:12.068
that you have to be the temple
of the Spirit,

00:11:13.577 --> 00:11:19.035
that the light of Spirit has to shine
within you.

00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:24.297
It is not for you to venture into all kinds
of funny things

00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:28.513
that human beings are doing.

00:11:35.063 --> 00:11:38.154
I don’t know if you have heard
of a terrible disease

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:43.100
in America called AIDS that has come in.

00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:54.930
It is spreading very fast

00:11:55.665 --> 00:12:02.224
and it is the result when man has said:
“What’s wrong?”

00:12:07.607 --> 00:12:12.281
“If I cut my nose, what’s wrong?”

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:18.988
But can you even create one cell
of your nose?

00:12:21.434 --> 00:12:26.121
We have no right to disturb this beautiful
mechanism

00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:29.905
that God has given us.

00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:39.682
We have to respect ourselves,

00:12:39.883 --> 00:12:44.976
because you are the epitome of this
creation.

00:12:45.642 --> 00:12:51.689
Only you are going to become realised,
not the chickens.

00:12:53.945 --> 00:13:00.706
Let us be kind to ourselves than to others
animals and things;

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:10.081
and to other human beings.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.294
That is much more important,

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:21.665
because this is the precious flower that
God has created to become the fruit.

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:29.674
Many people ask Me a question: “How is it
in ancient times, people had to work

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:35.122
very hard and only one could get
Realisation?”

00:13:45.843 --> 00:13:53.636
In ancient times if you had to go from
Paris to London you would never reach.

00:13:58.952 --> 00:14:04.950
But today how easy it is that we are even
going to the moon?

00:14:07.003 --> 00:14:09.160
Whatever has grown outside so much

00:14:09.361 --> 00:14:13.642
has to grow inside also.

00:14:17.863 --> 00:14:22.347
And the tree that is grown so big if
it does not look at its roots

00:14:22.548 --> 00:14:26.988
it is going to fall off and get destroyed.

00:14:32.248 --> 00:14:35.409
Same thing is going to happen to our modern
civilization

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:40.114
if it does not bother about its roots,

00:14:44.302 --> 00:14:51.158
and tries to develop those roots on which
this tree is standing.

00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:52.967
[Lady translator: “Sorry, Mother?”

00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:54.693
Shri Mataji: “Tries to develop those roots

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.323
on which the tree is standing”.]

00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:08.596
Also I must tell you when there is
a blossom time

00:15:08.797 --> 00:15:11.512
there are thousands and thousands
of flowers,

00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:17.615
but when the tree is just planted you might
get one or two.

00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:35.879
Today so many great souls have taken birth
to become the fruits.

00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:45.468
That is the reason why we are having
en masse Realisation.

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.349
Thousands of people are getting Realisation

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.738
and settling into it.

00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:05.417
Today I have told you as an introduction
to Sahaja Yoga -

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:14.912
Sahaja means, saha means 'with',
ja means 'born'.

00:16:16.813 --> 00:16:20.403
It is born within you.

00:16:21.636 --> 00:16:26.520
And Yoga means ‘union with the Divine’.

00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:34.314
So it is the right of every human being
because this is born within him,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.030
to have the spontaneous yoga.

00:16:47.388 --> 00:16:52.357
This is not a new method.

00:16:52.763 --> 00:17:00.429
Like a seed that sprouts, your Kundalini
also gets awakened.

00:17:04.272 --> 00:17:11.194
But in the olden days it was available
to very, very few people.

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:20.586
But now the time has come for all of you
to have it.
