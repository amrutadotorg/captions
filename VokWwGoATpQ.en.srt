1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:10,639
Today we are going to have a short session,
because you are all invited today to a dinner

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,440
after the programme.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:29,920
The host is my husband who wants to invite
you and he’ll be coming about 8:15 or 8:30.

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:44,370
So, today we are going to think about our
Spirit, which we have neglected throughout.

5
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,940
We are not even conscious that we have a Spirit.

6
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:03,760
Through Sahaj Yoga those who are now conscious,
because they can feel it through their vibrations,

7
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,520
they can also get lost and can forget it.

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:25,230
The Spirit is the only eternal thing within
us, all the rest are transitory and evolutionary.

9
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:34,380
Everything goes into evolution and the better
is the evolution, the higher the Spirit starts

10
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,150
manifesting itself.

11
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:50,940
Like the reflection on the stone of even the
sun is zero.

12
00:01:50,940 --> 00:02:05,200
And the reflection of the sun on the lake
is sometimes I think, is a reflection that

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:15,920
is felt in the Sahaj Yogis, when they see
it, feel it, it flows, they can feel the breeze

14
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,240
in their hand.

15
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:33,060
But still their attention is not fully enlightened.

16
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,280
The Spirit has not permeated inside.

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,800
It’s just reflecting still.

18
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:54,180
In the mirror you see the reflection of the
sun.

19
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:03,470
But even then, when you remove it you cannot
reflect it.

20
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:19,430
This is the difference – that even if you
become the mirror of the sun, unless and until

21
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:27,569
it permeates into your being and transforms
you into something new, you have not done

22
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,580
full justice to yourself and nor to the powers
of your Spirit.

23
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:43,650
The Spirit has come just like a vision to
you, an experience to you, but the growth

24
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,410
of your being has not yet started.

25
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,390
And if it has started it’s so slow that
you may not achieve much in one lifetime.

26
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:58,170
Because your attention is on all various things.

27
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,620
You have been misidentified from the very
beginning.

28
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,640
Since the time you were amoeba you have been
misidentified.

29
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,120
The matter played a big role in your life,
so matter was important.

30
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,690
Then all the five elements that are within
us were very important to us.

31
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,169
Because we can see them, feel them, we have
lived them for years, thousands and thousands

32
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,949
of years.

33
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:31,809
So they are part and parcel of your being
and that is why you are so much identified

34
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:32,809
with it.

35
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,710
Naturally, no doubt.

36
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,280
But in the living process it never happens
like that.

37
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:52,070
There are some seeds which grow so fast that
within one year they become trees after they

38
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,990
have been sprouted.

39
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,240
They bear fruit in one year’s time.

40
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:09,540
Some trees are such, but some of them linger
on and linger on and linger on and they take

41
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:18,439
too much time, so much so that maybe when
they are not yet fully developed any storm,

42
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:25,969
any wind, any one of these things can just
push them down.

43
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,169
So you have to make a rapid growth within.

44
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:41,180
Even after realisation I have seen people
do not pay attention to their Spirit.

45
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,099
So for every Sahaj Yogi today I would say
they have to ask, “Where is your attention,

46
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,099
Mr?”

47
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,099
Or Mrs.

48
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,619
or Miss, whatever it is.

49
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:55,099
“Where is your attention?”

50
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:05,229
For example we can be enveloped with problem-solving
something absolutely useless.

51
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,819
Specially in the West we do it much more than
in the East because we take it for granted

52
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,029
in the East, many things.

53
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:18,979
But here because we think by planning we have
achieved a lot, we start planning.

54
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:26,379
We start planning about going to a place,
and buying a ticket, and doing this and doing

55
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,169
that; everything is too planned out.

56
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:36,960
All the time we are wasting on something which
does not require any time at all.

57
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,490
Supposing you have to go somewhere, alright.

58
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:47,809
First of all I don’t know if going is that
important, but to some people that is much

59
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:48,809
more important.

60
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:54,090
Like one gentleman today came with his family
to see me, specially to meet me, according

61
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,090
to him!

62
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,089
I don’t know how far to believe.

63
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,120
So he wanted to have a special interview with
me in my house.

64
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,720
He had it and that’s how I am late.

65
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,770
He doesn’t mind that.

66
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,399
Then now he cannot come to the programme because
he has got some friends whom he has to meet.

67
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:17,030
His wife has not got Realisation, does not
matter [to him].

68
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,599
Because his friends are very loving people,
very good, they have been very kind to him,

69
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,259
he must meet them.

70
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,379
Where is the attention?

71
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:35,629
All these misidentifications we have, like
marriage also.

72
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,120
Some people come to me and tell me, “Mother,
we are very happily married,” or unhappily

73
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
married.

74
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,740
Or the one who is happily married is equally
a headache as the unhappily married.

75
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,300
The unhappily one you can understand why he’s
a headache.

76
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,259
But the happily married also says, “I must
do something for wife.

77
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:54,349
I have not done anything.

78
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,039
I haven’t bought her a diamond ring.

79
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,360
I must buy for her."

80
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,099
“I haven’t done this thing for her, I
must get her a Rolls-Royce, and do all this

81
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,099
and that."

82
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,220
But where is your attention?

83
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:23,330
The whole attention is diverted to things,
which has no play, which has no meaning, which

84
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,710
helps you nowhere.

85
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:33,550
Then the attention is, in a subtler way, in
many other things, like children.

86
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:41,360
Now children, if I say anything they’ll
say, “Mother, do you want us to neglect

87
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
the children?”

88
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,840
This is the problem.

89
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,830
Children are not looked after by you, they
are looked after by God.

90
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,740
You are just a instrument of God to look after
them.

91
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,990
The more you are with God, the better you
are with your children, you know how to handle

92
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,640
them, you are kinder to them, you know how
to solve their problems much better if you

93
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,380
are getting your power from God.

94
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:12,501
But if you are not interested in God, He is
not either interested in you.

95
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:16,830
That’s the thing we do not understand.

96
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:25,260
We think that if we are interested in God,
we are obliging Him.

97
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:38,660
Supposing you are interested in a job you
never think that way that you are obliging

98
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,080
the job.

99
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,340
But as far as the God is concerned we think
“Why?

100
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:56,080
We are obliging God!”

101
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,400
You are not obliging God at all, He is obliging
you.

102
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,690
The attitude is so funny among human beings
that you can’t imagine!

103
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:15,200
All the time they feel they are obliging God
and they are doing something for the God.

104
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,010
What can you do for Him?

105
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,500
Just think like that.

106
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,540
I met a lady, she said: “Oh, how did I get
cancer?

107
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
I don’t understand.

108
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,430
I used to always pray to God."

109
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,321
According to her, if she prayed to God, she
thinks she’s paid Him the money for His

110
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:39,630
job and He better look after her!

111
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,650
It is you who are obliged by His kindness,
by His compassion.

112
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,570
He is so gracious that He knows that you are
stupid.

113
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,760
He knows that you don’t know this.

114
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,270
He forgives you for your stupidity.

115
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:07,900
He knows that you are naive and that you are
children, that you are small, still not grown,

116
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,200
you are not matured enough.

117
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,180
If you are egoistical, He forgives you.

118
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,650
Because He’s compassionate.

119
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,490
But do not take it for granted!

120
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,480
Do not take it for granted!

121
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:35,500
Those who think that, “We can do whatever
we like and behave in whatever way we like,

122
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,300
as long as we pray to God.

123
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,260
Yes, He’ll do everything for us."

124
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,240
Why should He?

125
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,880
Where is our attention?

126
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,860
What is yoga?

127
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,602
In simple words, it is taking your attention
to the Spirit.

128
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:57,680
This is yoga.

129
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,670
What does the Kundalini do?

130
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,210
She raises your attention and takes it to
the Spirit.

131
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,980
Only after knowing the Spirit you can know
God, not before that.

132
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,560
That’s why all religions have failed.

133
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:29,930
The incarnations who came to propound these
religions said that again and again.

134
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,130
For example Christ said that you are to be
born again.

135
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:38,120
Alright, if you have to be born again, what
did we do?

136
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,050
“We got some people, certified that they
can give you rebirth."

137
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:49,370
So they will have some water very nicely put
in a very beautiful place in the church and

138
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,110
you very solemnly walk down, and they put
some water on your head and they said, “You

139
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,900
are now reborn!”

140
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,829
And you accept it!

141
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:59,829
You just accept it!

142
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:06,130
As a child – because you know I was born
in a Christian family – I used to laugh,

143
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,990
I used to say, “What’s this mockery going
on?”

144
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,750
I thought they are just playing like children,
though I was a child, but I used to think

145
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,350
they are really playing.

146
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,130
I didn’t know they were seriously doing
it!

147
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,130
(laughter).

148
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,180
Really, I did not know, till quite some time.

149
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,390
When I grew up I was surprised, they are serious
about it!

150
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:30,980
I mean, they believed in it, they believed
they were getting rebirth and “It’s baptism,

151
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,760
that’s the way it should be."

152
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
I really felt it.

153
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,680
I was amazed!

154
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,120
And how people were satisfied with that was
a greater amazement to me!

155
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,200
They would not ask, they would not challenge,
they would not say anything about it; whether,

156
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,930
“Am I really realised or not?

157
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,750
Am I really reborn?”

158
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,390
In the same way among Hindus, they do the
same nonsense.

159
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,110
Same thing they do.

160
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,540
When the child is about eight years of age,
or say, from five years to eight years they

161
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,590
call it as a ‘Yajnopavit samskara’.

162
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:11,130
(sacred thread ceremony) That is the day they
have to invite lots of people for dinner as

163
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,130
we have – you see, everything must have
a dinner with it!

164
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,400
The attention is more there (on food)!

165
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,180
And then they have a big function and then
they have a big puja, this that.

166
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,000
And the Brahmins, who are not connected with
God, are doing all the puja and worshipping

167
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,750
and everything and God is nowhere there!

168
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:41,050
And then the fellow gets a thread which is
to certify that he’s a Brahmin, from a person

169
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,480
who has certified himself that he’s a Brahmin!

170
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,310
It’s all self-certification and falsehood!

171
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,711
For a person like me it was amazing!

172
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:58,230
And I used to wonder, “What’s the matter
with these people?”

173
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,410
How have they taken all these things into
their hands?

174
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,290
Why don’t they question themselves once
for all?

175
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,260
“How we are doing?”

176
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:18,260
Not only [that] but I found them to be completely
mesmerised with the idea that they are doing

177
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,910
the right thing.

178
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:26,050
Every Monday I hear the people singing next
to my house.

179
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,180
What are they singing?

180
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,290
God alone knows!

181
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:34,150
They come, very well organised, just to sing
some sort of hymns and things like that, which

182
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,890
has no meaning, which is not going to reach
to God.

183
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,410
Where is their attention?

184
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:45,240
The attention has to be on the Spirit and
that cannot be there unless and until something

185
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,120
happens within you.

186
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,570
But those who have been seeking that attention,
those who have been asking that, “Oh Lord,

187
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:07,800
keep my attention on God and on seeking,”
are, the people, going to be blessed; not

188
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,380
the people who have their attention [elsewhere]:
now supposing in the morning they go to the

189
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,450
church and next day to the races, and third
day somewhere else.

190
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,780
Again on a Sunday morning they are there back
in the church, regularly.

191
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,860
And they say, “I regularly go to the church!”

192
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:36,360
The attention has to be on the Spirit, even
before and after Realisation.

193
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,819
Many people ask us, “Mother, then what should
people do before Realisation?”

194
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:50,260
They should put their attention on their Spirit,
asking for it, that, “Take my attention,

195
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,350
Oh my Lord, to my Spirit."

196
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,930
And not to accept something which is false
and nonsensical.

197
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:03,390
Because once you start accepting something
false it sits on your head.

198
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:11,130
It’s a vicious circle: you have to go ahead
with it and you don’t know where you are

199
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:17,260
and by the time you realise, you find you
are too old to give it up and you carry on,

200
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,260
somehow.

201
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,959
It’s like intoxication.

202
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,209
All falsehood of the world is an intoxication!

203
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,269
Because if it was not intoxicating or hypnotising,
why people carry on with it?

204
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:36,919
I mean, to me, I don’t understand: when
you know it is falsehood, why should you carry

205
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:37,919
on with it?

206
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,759
Of course, you can play with it.

207
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,240
That’s a different thing, just to play.

208
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,440
Just like children: they build everything.

209
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,160
If you tell “Put them on the sand,” they’ll
build a big castle and they’ll make a house

210
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,690
and they’ll make a cowshed and everything.

211
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,900
And [afterwards] just they break everything,
take it out, clear out the whole thing.

212
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,549
They know it’s just a play they have done
it.

213
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,879
They are conscious of it.

214
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:09,940
If this consciousness is there, then one should
say that such people are seekers.

215
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,750
That is the category of seekers, where they
are not satisfied with falsehood and they

216
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,899
want to find out the Truth.

217
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:24,289
Now the Truth is that the Spirit is within
you and you are the Spirit.

218
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,659
You are the beauty, the bliss and the joy
of that Spirit.

219
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,330
That’s what you are.

220
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:39,320
Because your attention is not there that’s
why you cannot feel your Spirit.

221
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:48,070
But your Spirit exists, it is within you,
in your heart, waiting for a moment to come

222
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:55,249
into your conscious mind, to be felt by you
in your central nervous system.

223
00:18:55,249 --> 00:19:01,119
It’s all there, built within you.

224
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:11,590
Man in his madness doesn’t realise that
God has made him from amoeba to this stage

225
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,659
for some purpose.

226
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:22,340
There is a big purpose behind everything,
and the purpose is that now you have to know

227
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,429
your Spirit by which you enter into the Kingdom
of God.

228
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,000
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

229
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How?

230
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,350
What is your passport?

231
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,480
Is your Spirit.

232
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,880
Because when the Spirit starts shining within
you, you start transforming.

233
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:55,820
You start transforming into a new being, into
a new personality with a new awareness and

234
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,749
you are a different person.

235
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,570
Your priorities change.

236
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:12,159
But those who are not really good seekers
I would say, may have a three-legged race,

237
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
as I call that.

238
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,739
They’ll be identified with something else.

239
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:17,940
What is a three-legged race?

240
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,400
Is that you are tied with one leg to another
personality.

241
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,239
Now this could be the job, this could be anything
else, and you are tied with it and the progress

242
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,169
retards, it goes down.

243
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:39,860
The progress in Sahaj Yoga is only possible
when your attention is on the Spirit.

244
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,500
How do you nourish it?

245
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,950
That’s another point.

246
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,480
The only solution is collectivity.

247
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,279
A person who is not collectively nourished
cannot grow.

248
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,500
He cannot grow whatever he may try.

249
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:09,659
These are the two very important points of
Sahaj Yoga and one has to understand [that]

250
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,660
this collectivity is to be grown within you.

251
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,619
But what do you become?

252
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:19,200
Actually what do you become after your growth?

253
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,360
You become a collective being.

254
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,350
So you have to nourish yourself in collectivity.

255
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:32,090
People just don’t understand this simple
point that you have to become the Collective

256
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,090
Being.

257
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:41,730
And that nourishment, if it is not growing
into you, then you are not a Sahaj Yogi at

258
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,730
all.

259
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:50,370
You are just having the trip of your ego or
your super-ego.

260
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,730
And this is very important.

261
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,009
By saying you are brothers and sisters and
this and that it’s not possible, I know

262
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,009
that.

263
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,009
It’s wrong.

264
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,009
It’s another game.

265
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,519
Just like baptism it’s another game to say,
“Oh, we are all united together and we are

266
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:13,640
all brothers and sisters and nothing should
prevent us from being that."

267
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Socially we can be alright, but politically
may not be, or economically we cannot be and

268
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,200
all sorts of things can come.

269
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,409
But after Realisation, when the Kundalini
rises through these seven centres and pierces

270
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:36,760
you through on the Sahastrara, then you start
feeling the vibrations, feeling the cool breeze

271
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,020
in your hand.

272
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,489
This is how your Spirit is talking to you.

273
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:42,840
The rapport is established.

274
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,669
You are connected with the Spirit.

275
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:49,999
That’s the sign.

276
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:56,239
If you are not connected then you have to
get connected, then we can talk about it.

277
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:59,059
Before you are connected what is there to
talk?

278
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:04,259
What is there to say?

279
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:11,489
Supposing this (mic) is not connected, how
can I use it?

280
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:12,489
Tell me.

281
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:13,489
Is there any way?

282
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,139
It’s so simple as that.

283
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:19,139
Everything is so simple which you people have
made so complicated.

284
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,210
To me, a simple person, I don’t understand.

285
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,659
I mean, it has to be connected or not?

286
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:32,110
Any telephone is to be connected to the mains
or not?

287
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,489
So the connection has to be there.

288
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:43,860
And once we decide the connection has to be
there then what are we doing about it?

289
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,359
That we are doing Sahaj Yoga.

290
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,890
What is Sahaj Yog?

291
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:58,679
Is the right of every seeker to have this
connection with the Divine.

292
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:05,100
This you are doing in your own right, no doubt.

293
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,350
There I cannot challenge your right.

294
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,889
It’s your right.

295
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:18,379
Say for example, in a government it’s decided
that all those people under sixteen must be

296
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:19,980
given £5 each.

297
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:27,149
Alright, as long as is under sixteen you have
a right and the government will see to it

298
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:32,250
that they fulfil that promise, isn’t it?

299
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:39,539
In the same way you are promised that, in
the modern times, all those who will ask for

300
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,350
Realisation will be granted.

301
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,950
What a promise to make!

302
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,039
Just imagine!

303
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,519
And use me for that purpose, or Sahaj Yogis
for that purpose.

304
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:57,909
This is being promised in many scriptures,
by many incarnations.

305
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:03,559
The time has come and I have to give you Realisation.

306
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,929
More and more people have to be given Realisation,
all those who ask for it.

307
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:10,840
Of course it cannot be forced onto anyone!

308
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,749
This is your right!

309
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:21,880
It is your right to ask for your property
but if nobody asks, the government won’t

310
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,070
go back on them and tell them, “Now, please
have it, we beg of you, we fall at your feet,”

311
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,509
and this and that.

312
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:29,960
Do they do that?

313
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,130
In the same way, nobody is going to fall at
your feet, but if you ask for it, that’s

314
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,889
your right, and you can have it.

315
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:46,499
But the difference is that the right is to
be exercised in a full way.

316
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:55,020
If you ask a right that, “I want to become
the governor of a particular place,” then

317
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,220
you should be able to assume that power.

318
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:09,859
In the same way, if you think you have right
then you must assume also the power of Spirit

319
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,279
within you.

320
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,169
You have to keep your attention to your Spirit.

321
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:25,749
Now, the whole system of Spirit is so dynamic
and beyond human comprehension that you are

322
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:28,029
suddenly amazed and surprised at it.

323
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:31,609
First of all you are amazed.

324
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:38,379
Then you start thinking, “How can that be
so simple?

325
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,639
How can that be so easy?”

326
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:43,809
I mean it’s not simple!

327
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:52,379
In the sense that you have been made from
amoeba to this stage.

328
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:54,830
Is it a simple thing to do?

329
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,340
Can you make one dog into a human being?

330
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,909
Or even a horse, which you like very much.

331
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:05,609
Can you?

332
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:10,499
To make so many human beings out of amoeba,
isn’t it a difficult thing?

333
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:17,429
And if you are made that, that evolution must
have rendered something within you, in that

334
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,850
something is built in you.

335
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,230
And when it works out it looks simple, but
it is not.

336
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:33,210
It has a big background which is being worked
out to bring you to this stage, just to know

337
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,620
‘thyself.’

338
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,059
“Know Thyself,” simple words.

339
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:49,460
It’s too simple for human comprehension
that’s why it is too difficult.

340
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,139
Because they cannot go to simple things.

341
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,149
“Know thyself”.

342
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,669
What is ‘thyself’?

343
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:58,239
You ask somebody, “Yes, I know myself very
well."

344
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:01,289
“Now, what do you know about yourself?”

345
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:05,159
“I like to go to pubs!”

346
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,450
That’s thyself!

347
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,390
“I like to become something great."

348
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,390
“I like…”

349
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,830
That’s what you know your self?

350
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,759
What you like?

351
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,450
Or else, “I am afraid."

352
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,049
“I am frightened."

353
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,710
“I don’t believe in this."

354
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,840
“I don’t do this."

355
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,529
“Is this ‘I’ the one you are?

356
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:30,850
Is it?”

357
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:36,330
Then they will say, “I am not sure."

358
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,769
But when you are the Self, that’s absolute
and that’s sure-shot that’s what you are.

359
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:47,490
You know this is it.

360
00:28:47,490 --> 00:29:00,330
When you talk as a Spirit, you have no doubts,
you have no doubt at all, because the absolute

361
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,539
is established in you.

362
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:10,230
For example, you take ten Sahaj Yogis, ten
small, little children who are Realised-souls,

363
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:17,679
and ask them to face a personality and ask
them, “What is the problem with this gentleman?”

364
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:25,519
And immediately they will say that, “This
gentleman has got this finger problem or this

365
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,730
finger problem."

366
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:34,179
All of them will say the same, with their
closed eyes.

367
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:38,240
Everyone will say the same thing.

368
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,739
They’ll not criticise each other, because
everybody will feel the same thing.

369
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:46,809
All the children will feel the same thing.

370
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:48,169
You cannot befool children.

371
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,159
They’ll say, “Yes, they are catching on
this finger!”

372
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,510
And you ask the person, “Have you got bronchitis?”

373
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,820
He says, “Yes, I have!”

374
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,700
Or something like that; even liver, anything
which is not even diagnosed by doctors.

375
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,749
Not only on physical side, on the emotional
side [also] you can say.

376
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:15,139
I met a lady the other day and said, I asked
her, “Do you believe in anything?”

377
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:16,139
She said, “I don’t believe in anything
whatsoever!”

378
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:19,549
What sort of a thing is that?

379
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:23,859
A personality and a personality I meet, I
tell you!

380
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,779
One ‘better’ than the other!

381
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:28,470
She said, “Only I believe in myself."

382
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,629
“Alright, doesn’t matter!

383
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:35,570
Even then I am agreed that you believe in
yourself.

384
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,999
But where is your Self?

385
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,409
Where is your Self; in what thing do you believe?”

386
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:44,799
When that Self manifests, then you have no
questions, you are doubtless, you know this

387
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,799
is it.

388
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:55,019
You have no question about anything whatsoever,
you know everything.

389
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:04,899
That’s how the vibrations tell you.

390
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:07,859
This is the Spirit that tells you.

391
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:11,210
The Spirit within you tells you.

392
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,590
You ask the Spirit, “What is to be done?”

393
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,399
You ask any question.

394
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:23,159
For example, I was born in a Christian family
and in India people felt very funny that a

395
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,460
lady who is supposed to give us our moksha
and our Realisation should be a Christian

396
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,360
lady because they thought she has to be a
Brahmin or something like that.

397
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,460
I am a Brahmin in a way because I am a Realised-soul.

398
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,299
I have no caste and community, but I am a
Realised-soul.

399
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:52,070
So, they asked me a question, “Mother, how
is it you were born a Christian?”

400
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,769
I said, “Alright, you ask on your vibrations:
‘Is Christ the son of God?’."

401
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:09,049
Imagine for Hindus and Muslims, to accept
this is very difficult.

402
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:14,230
And the vibrations [started flowing], and
the most orthodox of Hindus immediately, immediately

403
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,230
accepted.

404
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,519
For them one advantage is there that they
know that the cool breeze is the way you can

405
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,870
make out that your Spirit is flowing, that’s
the only way.

406
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,109
They know, that’s an advantage they have.

407
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,309
But they gave up all that, and a revolution
came into them!

408
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:34,429
Imagine Hindus of India, who are such orthodox
people, have been dominated also by Muslims.

409
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:38,619
Now they take the name of “Allah hu akbar,”!
They are trying to know the namaz.

410
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:41,710
They are trying to do the namaz.

411
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:48,830
All this fanaticism is going to be finished,
absolutely crushed, as soon as the Spirit

412
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,730
starts manifesting itself.

413
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:56,279
Because only truth will be accepted.

414
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:03,309
In the same way, we have Muslim disciples:
they have accepted Christ, they have accepted

415
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:14,635
Ganesha, they have accepted everything, because
on the vibrations you see the truth is there!

416
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,919
Fanatics will also have to come around.

417
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,490
But first those who are doubting fanaticism
will first of all get it.

418
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,470
How can any fanatic be correct?

419
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:33,909
Because they are talking about one God and
they are in juxtaposition with each other.

420
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:36,369
How can that be?

421
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,220
But it’s so.

422
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:46,799
If you talk to a fanatic, who is an ardent
Muslim and an ardent Hindu – they hate each

423
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,820
other!

424
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,249
They cannot understand how God could create
them, the one Person can create both of them.

425
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:53,919
They think they have separate Gods!

426
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,970
I don’t know how they carry on with their
fanaticism because I can’t understand.

427
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:08,290
But the entire truth about everything can
be known through your vibratory awareness!

428
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:18,850
And this vibratory awareness comes to you
through your attention which is enlightened

429
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,850
by your Spirit.

430
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,230
This Spirit resides within us.

431
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,260
All the time it knows everything what we do.

432
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,760
It’s the one which knows all our feelings,
wherever we move.

433
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:37,110
But the same Spirit, when it enlightens our
attention, the thing that He’s enjoying,

434
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:43,669
itself, or it is enjoying itself, becomes
our experience.

435
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:48,830
Because the Spirit is collectively conscious
and we become collectively conscious.

436
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:57,410
Those people who are not collectively conscious
are not Sahaj Yogis, they are absolutely just

437
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,410
‘so-called’.

438
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:06,280
First collective consciousness comes in, within
us, by feeling the cool breeze blowing through

439
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,220
our hands and by feeling all the fingers and
feeling all the chakras.

440
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,640
Some people don’t feel it in the hands if
their Vishuddhi is not alright, but still

441
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,570
they can feel within themselves.

442
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:24,480
Like there are devices I feel, as, if the
gas fails, then the electricity works out!

443
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,100
That also works out in many people.

444
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,680
You can feel it within yourself, where is
the problem and you can feel the chakras.

445
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:40,040
That’s the first thing happens to you, that
you feel the collectivity within you.

446
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,360
That you are a collective being you feel.

447
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,600
You also feel about yourself, what you are
catching, where you are catching.

448
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:59,780
And ultimately, then, you start feeling, nourishing
your collectivity.

449
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,420
Which is the point very much missed in the
individualistic society.

450
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:12,090
Because the whole of the individualistic society
is based on competition and there is no competition

451
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,180
in Sahaj Yoga.

452
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,340
It’s just the other way round.

453
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,710
That you nourish on other people.

454
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,930
The person who cannot carry on with other
Sahaj Yogis is a sure and certain person who

455
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,850
is going to get out of this.

456
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:34,160
You have to nourish yourself on collectivity.

457
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,050
And once you start doing it, somehow or other,
you see, I have seen some people, it clicks

458
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,230
with them, sometimes.

459
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,570
But with some people I go on telling them,
“This way, that way” in so many ways I

460
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,970
try to work it out, it never clicks.

461
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,690
But with some people it suddenly clicks and
they become different people.

462
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,314
Everybody then certifies, “Oh, they have
become very sweet now."

463
00:36:53,314 --> 00:37:01,190
But some of the people just go on, just like,
all the time they are like thorns, and anybody

464
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,430
they touch, that person gets a fright.

465
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,430
And then that person says, “Alright, I am
getting out.

466
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,400
I am not talking to anyone, I am not doing
this.

467
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,910
I am just keeping quiet."

468
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,600
That’s all they can do.

469
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,120
They cannot take out that thorn from themselves
and can become one, articulate with others.

470
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:27,630
And when this thing happens, one has to know
that there’s something wrong.

471
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,560
After all, from where are you going to get
your nourishment?

472
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:40,730
The Spirit is shining, the sun is shining,
but your tree of life has to get your nourishment

473
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,520
from collectivity.

474
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,190
Once you realise that, it works wonders.

475
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:53,960
It has worked wonders with so many people
all over the world.

476
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,570
But there’s a greater danger for people,
where individualism is regarded as something

477
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:08,630
great, where people think to be individualistic
in their attitude towards their selections

478
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,780
and choices and the decision-making.

479
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:21,950
For every small thing they will make a decision.

480
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,950
Why?

481
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,530
What is the advantage?

482
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,960
What did you gain by wasting so much energy
in decision-making?

483
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,310
Whether you’ll have the fish and chips or
you’ll have hamburger!

484
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,460
What does it mean?

485
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,080
Why waste so much energy on that?

486
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:45,770
Where is your attention?

487
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:54,140
All these things, all this attitude is nothing
but ego-oriented and is competitive.

488
00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:02,530
And also all the medias that are used are
just trying to exploit it.

489
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,120
Like they’ll say “If you have a cigar
it’s sufficient, you need not have a Rolls-Royce,”

490
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,280
or something like that.

491
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,970
So you buy a cigar like a madcap.

492
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,760
But if they put it in the television then
fifty percent [of] people will do it, as if

493
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,570
they have no brains to use.

494
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,310
It’s a mad world that way.

495
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:36,930
But it is not, in a way, because you are seekers.

496
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,170
Have you ever seen so many seekers?

497
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,720
Seekers of Truth.

498
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,230
They are not only claiming, they mean it.

499
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,540
I know, they mean it.

500
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,190
They are not just claiming.

501
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,480
It’s not a fashion with them, they do mean
it.

502
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:06,690
And I am really very happy about it that there
are seekers, those who are seeking, who are

503
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:13,800
honest and intelligent and who want to know
who they are.

504
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,660
Today, as I said, we’ll have a short programme.

505
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,810
And there’s no end to my speeches.

506
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:29,550
I don’t know how many speeches I have given
now, I’ve lost count!

507
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:38,810
This is only just to make your attention a
little steady – then the Kundalini rises.

508
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:45,000
Without that happening your attention cannot
go inside.

509
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,890
Once the happening takes place your attention
is pulled in.

510
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:56,870
The whole attention goes inside and it is
carried and is brought to this point where

511
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,220
it breaks.

512
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,090
This is the seat of your Spirit (on the Sahastrar),
while the seat (Spirit) resides in your heart.

513
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,150
And you are blessed with your Self-realisation.

514
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:13,020
Now, the growth has to come, that you have
to move your awareness towards the Spirit.

515
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:21,250
And when that happens, that your Spirit dominates
your awareness, that your awareness becomes

516
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,820
the Spirit, then Satchitananda [begins].

517
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,870
‘Sat’ is the essence of your awareness,
is the Truth; through your awareness you know

518
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,870
the truth.

519
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:39,760
‘Chit’ is the attention and ‘anand’
is the Spirit.

520
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,730
The essence of the Spirit is joy.

521
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,570
All these things become one.

522
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,240
That has to happen.

523
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,040
Then the growth is much faster.

524
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,420
When it is half way round, the growth is less.

525
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:14,510
And the growth is to be felt in your collectivity
not in how you organise some things and all

526
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,510
that – no!

527
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,510
In collectivity.

528
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,160
How you feel about the whole world, how you
are connected about the whole world.

529
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,730
What you are doing about it.

530
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,650
Can you work it out for them?

531
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,730
Where is your attention?

532
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,730
– Again.

533
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:32,530
As soon as you go on your Spirit you will
start worrying about the whole universe.

534
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,180
It will happen.

535
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,380
The priorities will change.

536
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,320
“Oh, I am here, I am the Spirit.

537
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,470
And my work is not this.

538
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,870
This is useless, this is not meant for me."

539
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:51,160
And the attention will start going from all
mundane, gross things to the spiritual side.

540
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,740
But by going there you become so dynamic that
all material things will work out just like

541
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,740
that.

542
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,021
(Shri Mataji clicks Her fingers) You’ll
have no problem with material things, they

543
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,021
will work out.

544
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:11,820
I’ll tell you that a few examples are like
this: You know I am a married woman and I

545
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,820
have got grandchildren.

546
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,670
I run my house very well and I have a household
and mine is a marathon race!

547
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,520
I mean, all of you have a relay-race but I
have a marathon one.

548
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,460
And it works out.

549
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,680
But apart from that so many problems are solved.

550
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,400
I’ll give you a simple example.

551
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,380
Some girls have come from Australia.

552
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,010
They told me, related, many problems they
have solved.

553
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:43,730
But one of them was very sweet that, there
was a lady: she very much wanted to come to

554
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:48,170
India to see me, and she thought her money
was not sufficient.

555
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,830
Now, money is absolutely material.

556
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:57,190
And the little child, daughter she had, she
also wanted to come.

557
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,440
And the girl was having a jumble-sale, something.

558
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,319
So she collected some of the trinkets here
and there and went for a jumble-sale.

559
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:12,070
And they discovered that she had a very expensive
bracelet of gold, suddenly, which sold out

560
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:23,220
for the amount of money exactly required for
the ticket of the mother and the child.

561
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,860
Exactly!

562
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,850
Oh, this is nothing.

563
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,480
There are many people who have known how materially
it works out.

564
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,330
For example we have a doctor of physics here
(Regis), who was doing his doctorate and he

565
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:43,590
did it for years and years, I don’t remember
exactly how many years.

566
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,030
And he brought his papers to me, he said,
“Mother, I cannot now have anything more

567
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:59,500
done, now I cannot even make it a fair thing.

568
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:12,300
I cannot put it in the bound.

569
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:20,030
And this is how I’m going to now present
it.

570
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,880
I am fed up.

571
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,510
I have finished every single pie (1/192 Rupee)
I had."

572
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,900
I said, “Alright."

573
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,200
I just did like this to the thing (gave a
bandhan).

574
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,580
He said, “Are You not going to read?”

575
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,180
I said, “No, what is there to read?

576
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
It’s alright."

577
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,180
You won’t believe – he went next day to
see the gentleman and he became a doctor of

578
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,180
physics!

579
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,180
That’s how materially things work out.

580
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
Krishna has said it, “Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

581
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,180
Yoga, when you get your yoga, when you are
connected with God, then He looks after you:

582
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
kshema – your well-being.

583
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,350
This is so simple to understand.

584
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:53,460
There’s another very simple truth one should
understand that, if we are not connected with

585
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,310
Him, how can He look after us?

586
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,630
We have to be connected with Him: so we know
His desires, we know His ways, we know how

587
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:05,980
to please Him, we know what to do and so we
can ask for what we want.

588
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,140
You don’t even have to ask!

589
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:14,680
You’ll be surprised how things work out
for you: how family relations improve, social

590
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,280
relations improve, economic relations improve.

591
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,120
All these things are on your centres.

592
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,700
And as the Kundalini rises She starts spreading
sideways also and you start getting the effect.

593
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:31,930
The first you get is the material and the
physical, and that’s how you know how we

594
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:36,120
have cured people of cancer and things, just
like that!

595
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,220
(Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers)

596
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:44,720
People don’t understand how we have done
it but we have.

597
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,980
Because Spirit is the dynamism within us,
it is the thing.

598
00:46:49,980 --> 00:47:04,030
Like one diamond which is put in a ring and
embedded in the soil, saved permanently, just

599
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:10,870
to keep it out of problems, is suddenly discovered.

600
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,000
And that’s why it is all we seek.

601
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,620
The basis of all our existence is nothing
but our Spirit.

602
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:23,500
That’s the basis, that’s the adhara, that’s
the support.

603
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:36,140
And to us it should be a special blessing
for our Lord, Jesus Christ, was the embodiment

604
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,280
of that Spirit.

605
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,110
He came on this earth just to show you the
way of your resurrection.

606
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,190
It’s a special blessing to us.

607
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:49,830
But Him also we have made it into a fanatic
stuff.

608
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,890
We are ‘great’ people!

609
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,780
Give anything to human beings and they know
how to make a good mess out of it!

610
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,740
That’s what I have discovered.

611
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:08,990
He was crucified: that was alright, because
He cannot be crucified, He cannot be killed,

612
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,990
that I know.

613
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:16,380
But the way now He is clouded and how He is
plucked out of reality and put into something

614
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,120
false – sometimes it’s so shocking, frustrating
and so humiliating that you can’t imagine.

615
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
Whatever done is done.

616
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,470
The quality of Spirit is forgiveness.

617
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:27,830
The symbol of Spirit is Christ.

618
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:42,350
And the power He has given us to forgive,
because He has that power to forgive.

619
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:48,680
He’s the power of forgiveness.

620
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,610
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

621
00:48:53,610 --> 00:49:01,550
So, He’s so powerful that He cleanses you
through forgiveness.

622
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:04,460
Just by forgiving you He cleanses you.

623
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,430
And that’s how it works out.

624
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:16,040
So you should not try to build a guilt in
your mind.

625
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,220
That’s the only thing most of the Christians
do, is to sit down and build a guilt by spoiling

626
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,220
this part of the chakra here.

627
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:29,030
It’s amazing how it has 
come to us, this guilt.

628
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:36,580
Perhaps the psychologists or confessions,
I don’t know what it has been.

629
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,930
They are guilty in imagination.

630
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,800
And that part is very sad.

631
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,800
That does not help.

632
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,690
You are not to be guilty.

633
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,030
You are the Spirit.

634
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,170
What crime Spirit can do?

635
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,170
Nothing!

636
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,830
Only you have to get out of it, to become
that.

637
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,010
That’s what we are going to have.

638
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,010
And let us work it out.

639
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,470
We have some new people over here.

640
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:04,580
I am sure it is going to work out.

641
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:11,780
But for all the new people now, I have to
say one thing, that Sahaj Yoga is not a thing

642
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,620
you just go for a programme and get out.

643
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,620
It’s dangerous to do that.

644
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,620
If you get your Realisation and still you
do not recognise Sahaj Yoga it will be very

645
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,020
difficult for you to come back to Sahaj Yoga.

646
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,170
So, please understand that, if you have found
the way, do not lose it.

647
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,170
Try to follow it.

648
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,170
I have nothing to gain from you.

649
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:28,920
It is you who has to gain; that’s your right.

650
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,910
You better have it.

651
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:38,370
May God bless you all.

652
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,960
About these chakras and all that: we’ve
got some papers, which you can see yourself

653
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,860
and read and you can understand.

654
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,370
Is there?

655
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:51,049
So, let us, put your hands like this and we’ll
work it out.
