1
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:13,610
Yogi: Mother you said in Caxton Hall that
if a person doesn’t speak to their mother

2
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:20,085
for a long time…can you elaborate
on that theme again please.

3
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:27,390
Shri Mataji: You see, you are born from a mother, alright?

4
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:31,191
You are not born hanging from a tree,

5
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:37,804
and neither you are thrown from the heavens
and suddenly you are found, born on this Earth.

6
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:40,885
You are born from a mother in her womb.

7
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:44,835
Her blood flows into you for nine months.

8
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:49,656
You live upon her.
You are a part and parcel of her being for nine months,

9
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:53,286
which is the most important time of your life.

10
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,498
Now, she is there to give you, first, the sense of security.

11
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:03,489
In a mother’s womb a child feels secured.

12
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,406
If the mother is upset it has an effect on the child.

13
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:11,874
If there’s something wrong with
her then that is affected on the child,

14
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:14,733
in the sense, physically, also.

15
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:20,612
It’s such a deep relationship exists between you and your mother

16
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:24,861
that I’ll have to write a book to tell you how much it is deep within you.

17
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:33,576
But, within us, the power of Kundalini is the power of a Mother and not of a Father.

18
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,811
The Father is the Witness as a Spirit and the Mother is the Kundalini,

19
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,179
and the Kundalini has to rise.

20
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:49,007
Now it is the Mother in you that is the Kundalini and your own mother.

21
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:53,195
It very much depends what kind of relationship you have with your own mother.

22
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:56,411
Supposing you do not know how to love your own mother,

23
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:03,306
you can never love your mother country, you can never love it.

24
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:09,657
That is the beginning. The training starts there only, with your mother.

25
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:16,920
If that point is lacking then you cannot have a full blooming of that love.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,328
Now maybe the mother has not been a very good mother possibly.

27
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:25,560
There are according to Sanskrit words, as I told you,

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,540
there cannot be a bad mother – kumata –
but sometimes she could be bad also.

29
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:37,314
So the idea of a ‘bad mother’ is more brought forth by

30
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:43,062
the intervention of law into mother child relationship.

31
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:48,748
When the mother is being punished by law

32
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:53,120
for correcting her child or doing something,

33
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,540
the artificiality starts; when people can sue their mothers.

34
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:07,012
The responsibility of the law is not to disturb the natural relationships.

35
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,862
If they start disturbing the natural relationship the artificiality starts.

36
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:20,249
And that’s why, in the countries where law has taken charge of children and such things,

37
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:26,781
without understanding the basic thing that it is a natural thing to love your child.

38
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,461
Instead of that, if they had encouraged mothers

39
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:35,349
who were more loving, more kind, if they had even training to mothers,

40
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:37,822
how to be more kind and gentle,

41
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:47,312
if they had given more impetus to people to be good mothers.

42
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:51,802
Instead of having beauty contests if they had ‘good mother contests’.

43
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:59,827
If motherhood had been upheld by political and economic institutions,

44
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:03,387
then it would have been much better.

45
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:07,602
But the whole society is turning to self-destruction,

46
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:09,968
so the law, first, takes over.

47
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:12,571
So the child is quite sure of itself.

48
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:19,463
Now an eighteen year old boy in the family,
who gets the dole (unemployment payments),

49
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,377
then he thinks no end of himself.

50
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:28,274
He answers back his mother;
he talks in a very rude manner to the mother.

51
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,458
It’s alright to say you have done it for an eighteen year old boy

52
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:34,142
but you don’t know that [maybe] he is the eldest boy;

53
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:37,382
the other children in the family follow him up.

54
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:41,309
So they pick it up when they are even very young.

55
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:46,370
The idea of giving money to boys at that age also is extremely harmful

56
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,060
because when he gets the money the other
children think they must also get some money,

57
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,490
so they start charging mother for the work that they are doing

58
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,597
– you must pay 5p for bringing a glass of water for the mother.

59
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:03,540
Then the mothers now are of a different type.

60
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,190
I mean, there are so many mothers who say that,

61
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,390
“It is not a thing that we should love our children; it’s not natural”!

62
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,850
Artificial has become natural and natural has become artificial.

63
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,715
How is it, within these [last] ten or fifteen years,
suddenly the mothers have become so funny?

64
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:27,760
Now, because of these pressures, what happens
is that we develop a feeling against our mother.

65
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,474
We start judging our mother and father.
We should never judge them.

66
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:36,048
We are not to judge them because we have chosen them.

67
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,923
They are there just as part and parcel of ourselves.

68
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:42,671
Supposing your nose is broken:
Do you start judging yourself,

69
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,271
“My nose is broken, my nose is broken”?
Do you discard your nose?

70
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:53,203
In the same way your parents are.
You cannot discard your parents!

71
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:56,393
But the whole society is working like this.
It’s a vicious circle.

72
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:59,598
Now, if I say, “You go and talk to your mother,”
then you can say,

73
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,405
“My mother is not a good person. She is this and that.”

74
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,410
Then I have to say, “Alright, then you forgive her.”
Then you don’t like it.

75
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:14,795
You would expect me to tell you,
“Alright, just go and bash her.”

76
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:18,400
You would be pleased if I tell you like that,
some of you would

77
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,546
– “Go and beat her up!” But I would not say like that

78
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,973
because that’s not the way
Sahaja Yogis are going to work away.

79
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:30,893
You must know that the whole society
is in a whirlwind, it’s a whirlwind,

80
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:37,566
so somebody has to steady oneself
and stop and try to change the winds.

81
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:40,293
And that’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to stand up

82
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:44,775
and understand that respect and reverence of parents is important.

83
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:50,712
But it is an actual thing, because if you are
not good with your mother your left side is weak;

84
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:56,235
you have seen it on the vibrations. Whatever I say
you can see it on your vibrations. You will be the loser.

85
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:59,370
So forgive her. Know that she has given you birth.

86
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,902
Maybe if she has been harsh to you,
angry with you or done something

87
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:07,872
– forgive her. And you will be amazed, you can win her over,

88
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:11,284
it’s not difficult because by your goodness to her,

89
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:17,133
by your over-goodness towards her, relatively, it will work.

90
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:20,443
And maybe, exceptionally, one person may be this thing (kumata)

91
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:23,714
but you cannot make a rule out of that;
exceptionally one may be.

92
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:29,923
But if you have to change the society,
the whole thinking, somebody has to stand up.

93
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:37,450
And it is a chakra within you, you know,
where it touches a point of Void,

94
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,052
where the left-side touches the point of Void.

95
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:44,714
That is a centre, a very important centre
for a mother, which [it] makes.

96
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:50,836
And do you know it is very near the centre of existence,

97
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:54,191
because your existence depends on that.

98
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,634
Supposing a child had no mother:
he can never be a good husband,

99
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:02,150
very difficult for him to be a good husband
because all the womanhood,

100
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,391
all the kindness, the sublimity, the greatness of women,
is known through your mother to begin with;

101
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:14,877
or a woman who does not have a
mother, can never be a good wife

102
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:17,529
or could not be a good mother herself.

103
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:21,588
All these things are there so we have to stop it and change it.

104
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,846
This is the point. Sahaja Yogis must know
that we have to change and transform ourselves

105
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:28,132
and that is the point [where] they feel bad.

106
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:33,137
We are not only responsible for our change but
we have to bring about the change in the whole world,

107
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:37,605
where the society is getting destroyed,
the human beings are getting destroyed,

108
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,393
so we have to stand up.

109
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:43,612
So we have to change our way of thinking.

110
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:54,289
What’s wrong in talking to your mother?
She’s not going to kill you if you talk to her.

111
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,160
Why don’t you talk to her? Because you hate her,

112
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,925
you want her to feel bad.

113
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,997
I mean, you don’t go and hit your mother.

114
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:09,939
This is the only way you can really be harsh
to her, is not to talk to her

115
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:15,361
– [so] she feels rejected by her own child
whom she has created.

116
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:19,858
God must be feeling that way also the way we reject Him.

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Everybody’s left side improves now.

118
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:35,119
But try to love and you will enjoy,
because loving is the greatest thing.

119
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:38,822
To love someone is adoration,
absolute adoration, is reverence.

120
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:46,855
If you love someone then you know that
it is so great, it makes you so great to love someone.

121
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:53,339
It’s a very great feeling that, “I love someone”;
it’s like a Lord one feels,

122
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,115
“Oh I love this one and I love so many
and so many are there!”

123
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,860
And that person need not love me,

124
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,832
I mean I don’t think all the Sahaja Yogis
love me so much as I love them, maybe.

125
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:09,357
But I’m very proud of my Sahaja Yogis and I love them.

126
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:13,568
This is the most joy-giving thing is to love, yourself.

127
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:19,289
To be able to love, that’s the greatest ability
a person should have – is to love others.

128
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:25,153
And in love, forgiveness is the most; that’s why
Christ said forgiveness is the greatest weapon.

129
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:29,745
And what do you achieve by not talking?
I mean, what do you achieve?

130
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:35,302
Let us see the other side of it; what do we
achieve by not talking to someone?

131
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:48,509
Rationally. It’s a sweet method of course, if sometimes
 children do, “I am not talking to you,” you see.

132
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,369
Then you can have a little play about that.
But it should be just a play.

133
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:56,913
If it is a serious stuff it’s nonsense.

134
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:01,060
It’s just to play about, is very good that,
“I’m not talking to you,

135
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,954
I’m not going to talk to you for some time,” he knows that.

136
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:13,632
But then it is not serious, it is just to bring out certain points

137
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:18,505
and it’s nice that mother should come and cuddle you
 and persuade you and try to help you

138
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:26,610
– that’s a good thing. But the way we are serious
about it is something wrong.
