00:06.321 --> 00:10.751
“Vichara shaithilya, is the relaxation
of the thought”

00:12.071 --> 00:22.355
Now we are trying to transform our energies
towards the energy of the Spirit.

00:22.556 --> 00:27.680
So you have to allow the Spirit to take
over.

00:28.824 --> 00:33.315
Your effort of your mind should be reduced

00:33.516 --> 00:38.484
and the energy of the Spirit should work
through you.

00:38.685 --> 00:41.744
Now how do you do it?

00:45.216 --> 00:54.047
First is detachment, detachment.

00:54.248 --> 01:00.729
Detachment start with the thought, let us
see the thought.

01:00.930 --> 01:04.919
It’s called as vichara shaithilya –
relaxation of the thought.

01:05.415 --> 01:10.831
But still this mind, which is quite silly,
tries to impress upon you

01:11.032 --> 01:20.191
that you have to use the old junky
instrument of this mind.

01:20.392 --> 01:25.554
And it asserts that “Better use.” And when
you start using that,

01:25.755 --> 01:29.777
ego comes in, you get attached to it,

01:31.444 --> 01:38.562
and what you lose is your progress
and thus the joy is minimised.

01:38.763 --> 01:42.658
How do you detach yourself?

01:42.859 --> 01:46.301
For a person who is absolutely detached
is very difficult

01:46.502 --> 01:51.100
to explain how to detach, isn’t it?

01:51.695 --> 01:54.302
I’ll try! Now.

01:54.505 --> 01:58.739
I cannot get attached. That’s the problem
is.

02:00.284 --> 02:07.090
So, just now if you give up your satta,
your own domain,

02:07.291 --> 02:11.559
you get into the domain of your Spirit.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.858
You give up your domain, that is your
ego’s domain,

02:18.059 --> 02:21.312
or may be your super-ego’s domain.
You give up that

02:21.513 --> 02:27.674
and try to see things how it works out.

02:27.875 --> 02:33.552
Now, what is the testing point of it?
How do you test it?

02:33.768 --> 02:40.468
It works out. That’s the point of testing.

02:41.155 --> 02:45.654
It works out. Allow it to work out.

02:45.855 --> 02:49.244
Don’t put your attention.

02:49.444 --> 02:53.431
Attention [word] has the second part of,
is the ‘tension’.

02:53.632 --> 02:58.870
And don’t try to say, “Why not today,
it should have happened today,

02:59.071 --> 03:03.903
we expected it to happen. Why not
at this moment?”

03:04.104 --> 03:07.001
That’s your ego.

03:07.202 --> 03:10.700
“Thy will be done”.

03:12.479 --> 03:21.466
So the thought that starts moving
in our mind all the time,

03:21.667 --> 03:26.688
which creates tensions is not the thought
of the Spirit.

03:26.889 --> 03:32.386
So, what you should say [is], “Not this
thought. Not this thought.”

03:32.587 --> 03:35.328
“Ya neti neti vachane nigamo avochus”

03:35.529 --> 03:40.070
“Not this thought, not this thought,
not this thought”,

03:40.604 --> 03:43.844
and see how you relax. Now you are
relaxing -

03:44.045 --> 03:46.968
“Not this thought, not this thought”.

03:47.169 --> 03:51.970
Just go on refusing accepting any thought.

03:52.171 --> 03:58.656
So you go into Nirvichara. In that state
you feel the Spirit.

03:59.852 --> 04:05.128
Christ has done the greatest work on this,
I should say, but we do not understand

04:05.329 --> 04:11.403
because His life was like a micro-thing,
you see, 3 years.

04:11.604 --> 04:16.323
So we have to open it out a little bit
and see what He did.

04:16.524 --> 04:21.648
He has given us the greatest weapon
of forgiveness.

04:22.418 --> 04:27.248
When you forgive a person, what do you do?

04:28.099 --> 04:34.867
You accept the situation, to begin with,
and secondly you forgive

04:36.608 --> 04:40.926
what you think has been done wrong to you.

04:41.127 --> 04:46.484
But because nothing can be done wrong
to your Spirit,

04:46.685 --> 04:50.497
you just forgive, because you are
the Spirit!

04:51.855 --> 04:58.778
And when you forgive, you have found
that your tension goes away.

04:58.979 --> 05:02.992
So even to your thoughts if you say,
“All right, forgive this thought,

05:03.193 --> 05:08.719
forgive this thought,” because thought is
also not to be punished.

05:08.920 --> 05:13.175
“Forgive this thought, forgive this
thought, forgive everything.”

05:13.376 --> 05:16.810
Not forget, forgive:

05:18.208 --> 05:23.277
because then you will even forget that
you are the Spirit!

05:25.372 --> 05:29.003
But “forgive all the thoughts that
are coming to me.”

05:29.204 --> 05:33.370
Just go on saying this, is a mantra.
What is a mantra?

05:33.571 --> 05:42.218
Is that power of the word that expresses
Spirit.

05:43.313 --> 05:49.258
So this is a very important thing Christ
has given us: the weapon of forgiveness.

05:49.459 --> 05:54.198
Everybody has that weapon, everyone
can use that weapon.

05:54.399 --> 06:00.031
You don’t have to put in any effort for it,
you don’t have to pay for it,

06:00.232 --> 06:03.657
it’s just you have to say, “I forgive.”

06:03.858 --> 06:09.957
You’ll be amazed your nerves will soothe
down, this tension,

06:10.158 --> 06:17.530
this pressure of these modern things
will be reduced

06:17.731 --> 06:21.685
if you go on saying, “I forgive, I forgive
them”.

06:21.886 --> 06:27.523
For example, you go and see some sort of a…
I mean,

06:27.724 --> 06:34.083
if you happen suddenly to see something
very filthy according to the Spirit.

06:34.284 --> 06:38.297
Maybe it is very exciting according
to normal human beings,

06:38.498 --> 06:44.498
but we are abnormal people and for us
if we find it rather ugly

06:44.699 --> 06:47.699
then the best thing is, to get over,
is to say, “I forgive,

06:47.900 --> 06:53.411
because they are ignorant, they are blind,
they are not yet there where I am.

06:53.612 --> 06:58.051
I am the one who is at the Source
of enjoyment,

06:58.252 --> 07:04.602
at the Source of peace and while these
are not, so I forgive.”

07:06.635 --> 07:12.295
And you’ll be amazed that this forgiveness
that Christ gives you

07:12.524 --> 07:20.160
works out vichara shaithilya, is
the relaxation of the thought.

07:22.975 --> 07:28.473
Now this opposite movement, that you have
to move,

07:28.674 --> 07:36.914
first of all should start at this point,
today, from forgiving others.

07:38.491 --> 07:43.834
Now what happens when you forgive someone?
That means you do not react.

07:44.035 --> 07:53.321
The power to react to somebody’s injuries,
insults is finished.

07:53.522 --> 07:58.667
And when that power is finished, you become
a powerful person,

07:58.868 --> 08:06.040
because nobody can now overpower you,

08:06.241 --> 08:14.638
because nobody can kill you, nobody can
hurt you, nobody can do anything to you.

08:15.267 --> 08:17.762
But it is not, again I’ll say,
shamelessness.

08:17.963 --> 08:23.169
You see, people can think that it is
shamelessness.

08:23.951 --> 08:29.794
So if somebody says to you something harsh

08:30.393 --> 08:35.205
and something that is wrong, you do not
accept it.

08:36.152 --> 08:43.799
So in Sahaja Yoga one has to understand
that it is just this central path,

08:44.000 --> 08:50.766
is just the balancing thing which is
important. It’s not an extreme of anything.

08:50.967 --> 08:54.716
Like when we go to say that you must
forgive everyone,

08:54.917 --> 09:00.097
it’s not going to that extreme where you
have done some wrong,

09:00.298 --> 09:05.055
and somebody says to you [and] you don’t
take that part of it, it doesn’t mean that.

09:05.256 --> 09:10.533
Again discretion is the engine of your
movement.

09:10.734 --> 09:18.083
So you have to see that, if they have
said it, something like that,

09:18.284 --> 09:21.692
“Is it? Have I gone against the Spirit?”

09:21.947 --> 09:28.584
It’s a very thin road on which you have
to walk.

09:28.785 --> 09:36.880
One side is the huge, big Gibraltar,
rock of Gibraltar, of your ego,

09:37.081 --> 09:40.161
the another side is a super-ego.

09:40.361 --> 09:45.453
In between is a small discretion path
going,

09:45.654 --> 09:49.264
on which you have to see both the sides,

09:49.465 --> 09:54.095
whether you are hitting yourself with
the rock of Gibraltar,

09:54.296 --> 09:59.228
or falling into the valley of super-ego,

09:59.429 --> 10:03.648
you should see that you are using
your discretion.
