00:49:29.665 --> 00:49:32.861
Today is the great day,

00:49:33.062 --> 00:49:38.392
when a great son of the Goddess was born,

00:49:38.908 --> 00:49:42.394
at least it is celebrated today.

00:49:44.323 --> 00:49:47.287
And you are all assembled here

00:49:47.488 --> 00:49:55.322
to celebrate the birthday of Christ.

00:49:59.171 --> 00:50:05.068
You already know how He came on this earth,

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:09.473
and what was His great work.

00:50:09.674 --> 00:50:14.466
But we must see to the subtle side
of Christ.

00:50:14.667 --> 00:50:18.052
What was His power?

00:50:19.371 --> 00:50:24.243
Christâ€™s power was, of course, Omkara.

00:50:24.444 --> 00:50:29.174
His power was Pranava.

00:50:30.655 --> 00:50:34.574
But the essence of Christ

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:44.654
was tapasya, tapasvita.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:51.610
He is the incarnation of tapasya,

00:50:53.392 --> 00:51:03.766
and in that incarnation is a sinless
personality.

00:51:12.615 --> 00:51:15.413
He's sinless.

00:51:15.614 --> 00:51:20.030
Of course incarnations never commit sins.

00:51:20.872 --> 00:51:28.250
But apparently things that look like sins

00:51:28.459 --> 00:51:32.245
are also not in His life story.

00:51:32.446 --> 00:51:38.187
Like one can say that Shri Rama gave up
His wife, so it is a sinful thing.

00:51:38.388 --> 00:51:41.173
Of course those who understand
the subtleties of Shri Rama's life

00:51:41.374 --> 00:51:43.797
will know that it's stupid to say such
a thing.

00:51:43.998 --> 00:51:48.452
Or Shri Krishna's life, they might say
He married so many women.

00:51:48.653 --> 00:51:55.234
But in Christ's life you do not find
anything

00:51:55.435 --> 00:51:58.493
that could be pointed out as a mistake,

00:51:58.705 --> 00:52:03.165
even a slightest mistake.

00:52:03.366 --> 00:52:09.940
It's a very straightforward life,
absolutely pure life

00:52:10.144 --> 00:52:20.437
and doing no commitments of ambiguous
nature.

00:52:23.371 --> 00:52:28.015
But it's very surprising that Christianity

00:52:28.216 --> 00:52:32.984
is just the opposite of what Christ
wanted it to be.

00:52:33.185 --> 00:52:35.956
They painted Him so differently,

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:42.094
brought Him out so differently
and made a mess of His life.

00:52:42.295 --> 00:52:45.068
Terrible mess I must say,

00:52:45.269 --> 00:52:52.858
because He was the person who tried to keep

00:52:53.059 --> 00:52:58.680
to the maryadas of the dharma
to the maximum.

00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:07.774
And while the Christians stretched their
imagination to such an extent

00:53:08.004 --> 00:53:15.362
that their sinful life is shocking,

00:53:15.563 --> 00:53:21.604
the kind of sins they commit is extremely
shocking.

00:53:21.805 --> 00:53:27.125
For example, He said in a very subtle way,

00:53:27.326 --> 00:53:31.918
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:53:32.377 --> 00:53:36.736
Even in Sahaja Yoga I find people still
have this problem.

00:53:36.946 --> 00:53:40.494
What a sinful thing to do to Christ.

00:53:40.695 --> 00:53:49.096
For Christians to have such eyes which
are adulterous,

00:53:49.297 --> 00:53:55.885
and they are the people who have
the maximum number of this sin.

00:53:56.086 --> 00:54:01.101
Not only that, but they generate it, they
give it to others.

00:54:01.302 --> 00:54:06.449
Those who go to them, they develop it.

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:13.415
Those who meet them, they take it up
as something very great and elite.

00:54:13.616 --> 00:54:17.680
It's such an infectious horrible stuff,

00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:25.523
and even after coming to Sahaja Yoga
if you do not understand,

00:54:25.724 --> 00:54:31.062
I cannot say what one can achieve in life.

00:54:31.263 --> 00:54:35.815
Because He's the gate. You may cross
over all your chakras,

00:54:36.016 --> 00:54:40.436
but if you are closed at that chakra
you cannot get out.

00:54:40.637 --> 00:54:46.195
The kind of sinful life people are leading
in the western country

00:54:46.396 --> 00:54:53.124
has to be absolutely condemned and has
to be thrown out of it,

00:54:53.325 --> 00:54:56.977
and nobody should explain it.

00:54:57.178 --> 00:55:01.616
Nobody should say that it is something,
is just a sin,

00:55:01.817 --> 00:55:08.146
and all right, Mother will forgive, all
this kind of a nonsense.

00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:14.915
Is the greatest wrong you are doing
to yourself and to Christ.

00:55:15.116 --> 00:55:21.964
The abandonment of your character,

00:55:22.165 --> 00:55:28.897
which was just the opposite of the golden
character of Christ.

00:55:29.098 --> 00:55:37.089
He burnt Himself like chandan, sandalwood.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:44.734
Like gold He came out of that fire of hell

00:55:44.935 --> 00:55:49.523
to burn away all that is sinful.

00:55:49.845 --> 00:55:54.586
So the first attention of anybody who
wants to cross the Agnya

00:55:54.787 --> 00:56:00.864
has to be a sinless life,

00:56:01.065 --> 00:56:04.909
and that is what one has to realize

00:56:05.125 --> 00:56:11.229
that how, in the West, they have become
all anti-Christ.

00:56:12.192 --> 00:56:19.225
On this day of His birth, one has to say

00:56:19.426 --> 00:56:27.625
that a great life, a great personality,

00:56:27.826 --> 00:56:33.102
was not only wasted, but perverted,
misused.

00:56:33.659 --> 00:56:39.059
Just can't believe, how can you use
the life of Christ

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:44.104
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things?

00:56:48.519 --> 00:56:55.776
We have one instance where Christ
converted water into wine.

00:56:55.977 --> 00:57:03.187
I can do it also - very easy. The wine
is not the alcohol.

00:57:03.388 --> 00:57:10.528
Alcohol is the rotten wine. You have
to rot it for days together

00:57:10.729 --> 00:57:14.442
and the more rotten it is, the more
old it is,

00:57:14.643 --> 00:57:18.600
then it is regarded as something
very expensive.

00:57:18.801 --> 00:57:22.656
The whole idea is so ridiculous,
I tell you,

00:57:22.857 --> 00:57:29.543
so repulsive, absolutely below

00:57:29.744 --> 00:57:33.510
the dignity of human level to bring down
Christ

00:57:33.711 --> 00:57:39.424
into all these social lives that you are
leading there.

00:57:41.534 --> 00:57:45.807
For you it is important now, all the Sahaja
Yogis from the West,

00:57:46.008 --> 00:57:52.217
to stand up and make your life pure,

00:57:53.266 --> 00:57:57.752
make yourself pure, and hate all

00:57:57.953 --> 00:58:01.799
that is created in the name
of Christianity.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.697
Actually, thank God, they have found out
now

00:58:04.897 --> 00:58:10.201
the book written by Thomas who has
described

00:58:10.402 --> 00:58:13.319
the Gnostic way of life, where "gna"
means "to know".

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.071
In Sanskrit language, "gn" means "to know",
"gnya".

00:58:18.272 --> 00:58:21.765
So he has described very nicely
the gnostic light.

00:58:21.966 --> 00:58:29.202
This Gnostic Bible, or whatever you may
call it,

00:58:29.403 --> 00:58:36.645
says about a personal experience
of achieving

00:58:37.623 --> 00:58:40.864
God realization, Self-realization.

00:58:41.065 --> 00:58:44.432
It talks about Sahaj Yog out and out.

00:58:44.633 --> 00:58:50.462
Thomas on his way to India, went to Egypt

00:58:50.663 --> 00:58:58.524
and there he has put this in a big vessel
of some metal.

00:58:59.622 --> 00:59:02.950
Thank God it was done in Egypt,

00:59:03.151 --> 00:59:06.230
otherwise in any other place

00:59:06.431 --> 00:59:11.481
they would have used it for some other
purpose,

00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:15.785
and already it would have been a perverted
thing.

00:59:15.986 --> 00:59:20.984
It's important, and very important for all
of us

00:59:22.554 --> 00:59:26.552
to understand that the first and foremost
thing for us

00:59:26.752 --> 00:59:29.666
is to purify our attention.

00:59:29.867 --> 00:59:32.324
And for that Tukarama has said,

00:59:32.525 --> 00:59:40.251
"Thank God, if I become blind is better."

00:59:48.723 --> 00:59:51.614
He was born in a very humble place

00:59:51.815 --> 00:59:55.549
because He was a tapasvi.

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:59.797
For a tapasvi it doesn't matter where
you are,

00:59:59.998 --> 01:00:07.137
whether you are in a humble place or
you are in an elaborate place.

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:13.005
It doesn't matter where you are born
in a very humble way.

01:00:13.206 --> 01:00:23.925
And this humility of His is never, never
expressed in the western lives.

01:00:28.098 --> 01:00:36.874
On the contrary, I find they despise people
who are humble,

01:00:37.605 --> 01:00:40.461
the humble abodes are despised.

01:00:40.662 --> 01:00:49.604
Now it is for you people to bring back
the glory of Christ,

01:00:49.805 --> 01:00:55.076
to bring back the dharma of Christ,

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:59.972
to reflect the great image of Christ.

01:01:00.173 --> 01:01:04.810
When people say that you had no ideals,
I'm amazed.

01:01:05.011 --> 01:01:13.295
Who could be a better ideal than Jesus
Christ?

01:01:13.496 --> 01:01:16.455
Can't think of anybody better,

01:01:16.656 --> 01:01:24.242
but nobody tries to follow Him, only try
to use Him for wrong purposes.

01:01:24.585 --> 01:01:29.289
Christmas means they are all must be drunk
already everywhere,

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:36.661
already drunk, and maybe they might have
had all kinds of programs

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:42.492
to show that they are absolutely insulting
Christ.

01:01:42.693 --> 01:01:44.792
So today we have to pray for them,

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:48.539
that may God give them some sense,

01:01:48.745 --> 01:01:50.896
not to do these things in the name
of Christ.

01:01:51.097 --> 01:01:53.468
They can do in the name of Satan
is all right,

01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:59.643
but in the name of Christ to do all these
things is extremely wrong.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:06.510
So coming to His Mother,

01:02:07.733 --> 01:02:11.643
She was the power behind it.

01:02:11.844 --> 01:02:16.034
And in India still all those people who
believe in Christ

01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:20.898
do respect Her as something like a Goddess.

01:02:21.099 --> 01:02:25.060
But other Indians, who are not Christians,

01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:32.791
really think Her to be Goddess, and they
visit Her temples all over.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:37.675
She was Mahalakshmi. And She was
Mahalakshmi,

01:02:37.876 --> 01:02:43.316
which shows that people who follow
the Mahalakshmi principle

01:02:43.517 --> 01:02:49.845
are beyond the material understanding
of life,

01:02:50.046 --> 01:02:52.210
beyond the Lakshmi principle.

01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:55.449
On the contrary, what we find,

01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:02.724
they are extremely conscious about
the material wealth.

01:03:02.925 --> 01:03:05.809
You should see how it shows so clearly.

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:10.454
Anything that they will buy, they would
like to buy something that can sell.

01:03:10.655 --> 01:03:13.594
It must have a guarantee.

01:03:13.795 --> 01:03:18.157
Even if they want to have anything

01:03:18.358 --> 01:03:24.559
like a small little spoon, they would like
to see a brand behind it.

01:03:25.863 --> 01:03:29.143
All the time they are thinking what can
they sell

01:03:29.344 --> 01:03:33.893
and what can they buy to sell it.

01:03:34.132 --> 01:03:39.149
The attention doesn't go beyond that.
Moreover,

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:48.895
they are very much impressed by people who
wear something rather expensive or unique.

01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:53.878
One day I was wearing a ring, I think,
it's an old ring of mine.

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:55.997
For me it was nothing, I mean I just
thought

01:03:56.198 --> 01:03:59.749
it's an old ring and was matching with
the sari, so I wore it.

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:02.233
Everybody started saying Me, "Madam,
Madam, Madam."

01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:04.137
I said, "What has happened?"

01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:07.919
Started looking, I'm wearing a simple sari,
what is it?

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.862
Then one lady asked Me, "Is that
a real ring?"

01:04:12.063 --> 01:04:16.229
I said, "Yes, yes, yes, so?"
"Oh Madam, Madam, Madam!"

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:19.628
I was amazed. Otherwise, I had no value,

01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:23.072
except for that ring, for which I had
no value at all.

01:04:23.279 --> 01:04:26.998
I just wore it by chance. It's an old ring
from My family.

01:04:27.199 --> 01:04:30.540
All right, it might be real. So what?

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:35.490
Immediately you become "madam" if you
wear a ring.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:40.694
It's very surprising. But in this country

01:04:40.904 --> 01:04:45.969
if you are going in a big car, people
don't like you much.

01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:49.180
If you are going in a big car, and you
want to buy some vegetables,

01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:53.865
they will say, "Oh, how much black-market
money have you got?"

01:04:55.186 --> 01:04:58.673
Not much respect for people who have money.

01:04:58.882 --> 01:05:01.411
Of course, you are expected to dress up

01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:05.323
according to your status in life. But
that's all.

01:05:05.524 --> 01:05:07.635
Those who wear do not have
the consciousness,

01:05:07.836 --> 01:05:12.154
and those who see them do not have
the consciousness.

01:05:13.778 --> 01:05:18.128
It is something very surprising, that where
you are supposed

01:05:18.329 --> 01:05:21.494
to be worshipping the Mahalakshmi
principle,

01:05:21.695 --> 01:05:27.369
people just get absolutely blown off

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:31.794
if they see something extraordinary.

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:38.785
I have seen people, I mean very, supposed
to be,

01:05:38.989 --> 01:05:43.063
you can say high class ambassadors
and all that.

01:05:43.264 --> 01:05:46.515
If they come to My house. they would
like to turn

01:05:46.716 --> 01:05:53.917
the plate to see from where it comes,

01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:58.713
or they would like to, even to see
the spoon from where it comes.

01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:00.906
It's very surprising.

01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:06.308
Actually, we do not know in this country
what comes from where, what is the mark.

01:06:06.509 --> 01:06:09.058
We don't have any marks, nothing
of the kind.

01:06:09.259 --> 01:06:14.086
And we are existing alright, nothing
wrong with us.

01:06:15.245 --> 01:06:20.544
This kind of mental attitude towards life

01:06:20.745 --> 01:06:25.889
and the mental projections towards life

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:30.078
makes you absolutely gross,

01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:34.560
while Christ was the subtle, complete
subtle.

01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:39.629
It was nothing but subtlety itself
personified.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:46.811
He was so subtle, He was such a sukshma
that He walked on the water.

01:06:47.773 --> 01:06:54.612
He was nothing but pranava, just
vibrations.

01:06:54.895 --> 01:06:57.564
He walked on the water.

01:06:57.765 --> 01:06:59.874
There was no jada tattwa in Him.

01:07:00.075 --> 01:07:03.344
There was no gross principle in Him,

01:07:03.545 --> 01:07:13.167
and while the people who follow Him are
following nothing but the jada tattwa.

01:07:13.419 --> 01:07:17.300
I have to now request you all today

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:21.631
to understand that when we are celebrating
the birthday of Christ,

01:07:21.832 --> 01:07:27.870
we have to imbibe His qualities, His
subtleties, His greatness.

01:07:28.071 --> 01:07:32.638
Also, I would request Indians, because they
are also becoming westernized now,

01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:36.189
thinking that western people are
the wisest.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.876
They have to understand

01:07:39.077 --> 01:07:44.681
also that we should try to be subtler and
subtler, and not gross,

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:49.753
and this is what is important in Sahaja
Yoga culture.

01:07:49.954 --> 01:07:55.512
In Sahaja Yoga culture, our attention is
on the subtle things.

01:07:55.713 --> 01:07:59.421
On the beautiful varieties of subtleties.

01:07:59.622 --> 01:08:05.736
To see all the sweetness and the goodness,

01:08:05.937 --> 01:08:19.151
all the artistic, aesthetic projections
of human mind.

01:08:19.352 --> 01:08:23.110
Not the gross, not the grotesque.

01:08:23.311 --> 01:08:26.828
It's going to be a new culture for us.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:29.048
We have started the dharma, all right.

01:08:29.249 --> 01:08:31.654
But every dharma has to have a culture

01:08:31.866 --> 01:08:41.005
and we are the culture of sukshma,
of the subtler life.

01:08:41.206 --> 01:08:44.778
That doesn't mean we should be untidy

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:48.776
or any way funny type, funny looking
people.

01:08:48.977 --> 01:08:55.703
Subtler people are the most beautiful,
are the most congenial,

01:08:55.904 --> 01:09:06.309
are the most idealistic, and are the most
honorable like Christ.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.868
So for us the ideal is Christ.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:13.848
Of course, I don't expect you to crucify
yourself.

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:19.281
But always willing to sacrifice,

01:09:19.482 --> 01:09:26.437
coping with all the discomforts and
problems

01:09:26.638 --> 01:09:32.970
and not talking about yourself, not
worrying about yourself,

01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:38.397
not discussing other and judging others,

01:09:38.598 --> 01:09:43.750
but giving assurances to people,

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:51.710
that now we are at this level, we'll be
at a higher level,

01:09:51.911 --> 01:09:56.053
and all the world has to come up
to that level.

01:09:56.254 --> 01:10:00.565
Very positive talking, very positive
thinking

01:10:00.766 --> 01:10:05.785
and very positive doing is the way you
can really follow Christ.

01:10:05.986 --> 01:10:15.611
Whatever He had to do, He did it with
such grace and beauty.

01:10:16.222 --> 01:10:21.674
That is what it is. So we have to be born
like Christ today.

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:28.726
You are all born like Christ because you
are born without the Father,

01:10:28.927 --> 01:10:34.045
by the Holy Ghost, just like Christ was
born.

01:10:34.246 --> 01:10:38.372
But look at Him and look at yourself,

01:10:38.573 --> 01:10:42.596
born the same way as He was born.

01:10:42.797 --> 01:10:49.676
So you must respect yourself as He
respected Himself.

01:10:49.877 --> 01:10:55.944
And the way He worked out His resurrection.

01:10:56.145 --> 01:10:59.614
In the same way, you all have to work out
your resurrection,

01:10:59.815 --> 01:11:02.173
and that is very important.

01:11:02.538 --> 01:11:05.650
Today you have to just ask just one thing
from Me, that

01:11:05.851 --> 01:11:08.894
"Oh, Mother, today we ask you to give us

01:11:09.095 --> 01:11:16.433
that power of penance, of tapasya
of Christ."

01:11:16.634 --> 01:11:21.612
I wish this would be granted today and
you will become tapasvis.

01:11:21.813 --> 01:11:25.608
May God bless you all.

01:12:55.954 --> 01:12:59.601
Happy Christmas to you.
Yogis: Happy Christmas, Shri Mataji.

01:12:59.802 --> 01:13:02.149
Shri Mataji: Today you have sucked
My vibrations alright.

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:04.296
May God bless you all.

01:13:51.095 --> 01:13:54.492
May God bless you all.
