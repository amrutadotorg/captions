WEBVTT

00:01.698 --> 00:08.421
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Shri Mahavira

03:43.284 --> 03:50.308
Shri Mahavira Puja. Barcelona (Spain), 17 June 1990.

03:52.403 --> 03:56.083
Today we are going to do the puja of Mahavira

03:56.283 --> 04:00.696
and we never had this puja before.

04:08.968 --> 04:12.254
The reason for this was that

04:12.455 --> 04:19.061
Mahavira’s life was an ascetic’s life,

04:24.107 --> 04:28.036
just like Buddha.

04:29.639 --> 04:34.677
Even more than Buddha it would be

04:34.877 --> 04:41.521
because at the time when these two were born,

04:47.187 --> 04:53.779
the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form.

04:59.543 --> 05:01.947
People had become extremely ritualistic

05:02.147 --> 05:05.106
and they were worshipping all kinds of stones

05:05.306 --> 05:11.160
and all kinds of things instead of worshipping only the swayambu.

05:21.542 --> 05:25.860
Who is that fellow eating food at the time of puja?

05:27.201 --> 05:30.212
There is a gentleman who is eating food at the time of a –

05:30.412 --> 05:33.905
Please tell him.

05:49.626 --> 05:54.300
Let it be, let it be open (the window).

05:56.649 --> 06:01.764
The ascetic life of Mahavira

06:01.964 --> 06:05.805
was of a very, very extreme nature.

06:12.852 --> 06:23.253
He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kshatriyas,

06:27.888 --> 06:31.671
and then He was also married.

06:34.496 --> 06:38.669
Also, He had a daughter

06:38.869 --> 06:43.458
and then He decided – because He knew He had

06:43.658 --> 06:49.449
to do the work of the Divine –

06:49.649 --> 06:53.181
He decided to take a sanyasa.

06:59.584 --> 07:01.669
So, He took the permission of his brother,

07:01.869 --> 07:04.122
because his parents were dead.

07:04.322 --> 07:08.447
He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth,

07:08.647 --> 07:13.604
everything and He became a complete sanyasi.

07:25.317 --> 07:33.654
And He left his family, left his house everything behind

07:33.854 --> 07:40.817
and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.523
And the people who joined Him were very few

07:54.723 --> 07:59.993
and He asked them that, "You have to also become ascetics, munis."

08:06.803 --> 08:10.383
He was a reincarnation of St. Michael

08:14.242 --> 08:18.709
and He resides on the Left Side,

08:18.909 --> 08:22.540
on the Ida Nadi.

08:22.740 --> 08:25.993
And He looks after the whole of it,

08:26.193 --> 08:31.161
right from Mooladhara onwards up to the Sahasrara.

08:36.471 --> 08:41.590
So, St Michael was born as Mahavira,

08:45.292 --> 08:49.506
meaning the greatest warrior.

08:52.082 --> 08:58.049
But when He was born, the whole place got lot of prosperity.

08:58.249 --> 09:02.406
That’s why He was called as Vardhaman, to begin with.

09:12.144 --> 09:17.278
But his asceticism was there because of the Brahminism

09:17.478 --> 09:19.397
that was so prevalent in those days,

09:19.597 --> 09:24.246
and people were absolutely drowned into it.

09:31.293 --> 09:36.585
After Shri Krishna, these two persons, Buddha and Mahavira,

09:36.785 --> 09:40.821
both of them incarnated in India.

09:48.099 --> 09:51.272
As you know, their history is very far out because

09:51.472 --> 09:56.047
they were the children of Rama and they were two twins,

09:56.247 --> 10:00.383
called as Lav and Kush.

10:07.322 --> 10:12.305
So, Rama led a life of a very great king,

10:12.505 --> 10:16.544
benevolent king, and of lots of limitations,

10:16.744 --> 10:19.744
mariada Purushottama.

10:25.998 --> 10:31.366
Because of that, people became extremely serious and

10:31.566 --> 10:40.792
also very closed, because of Rama’s following.

10:46.156 --> 10:49.829
Of course, after every incarnation,

10:50.029 --> 10:53.393
as they do not get their Realization, they get deviated

10:53.593 --> 10:58.386
and start going to the extremes of everything.

11:04.945 --> 11:10.745
So, they went to the extremes and became very, very much –

11:10.945 --> 11:14.328
sort of quiet people wouldn’t talk to anyone

11:14.528 --> 11:17.415
and would be very formal sort of people,

11:17.615 --> 11:22.798
because that was the life Rama had to live, lead.

11:32.580 --> 11:36.976
And because Rama left his wife, many people at that time

11:37.176 --> 11:42.581
felt that wife is not to be paid so much attention to.

11:50.267 --> 11:55.651
So, Shri Krishna came. Actually, Rama took birth as Shri Krishna

11:55.851 --> 11:58.851
to overcome these conditionings.

12:06.807 --> 12:10.823
And He said, "All this is lila. This is all a play."

12:14.533 --> 12:17.984
And that it is a play and you should have pure heart

12:18.184 --> 12:20.904
and you can play about.

12:21.104 --> 12:24.904
There is, as long as you have pure character,

12:25.104 --> 12:30.581
nothing can go wrong if you mix up with people freely.

12:40.159 --> 12:43.500
So, after Shri Krishna, people started becoming

12:43.700 --> 12:48.288
very licentious and permissive

12:54.654 --> 12:59.041
and they created poems and things of Krishna’s love stories,

12:59.241 --> 13:02.728
which was all false.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.869
Because He lived with Radha at the age of five or six years,

13:11.069 --> 13:14.982
and with the, in the Gokul.

13:19.720 --> 13:24.750
So, all these false stories about Him were used

13:24.951 --> 13:29.737
for the licentiousness of the people.

13:34.580 --> 13:41.690
So now, the situation was such, that the whole place

13:41.890 --> 13:46.961
was getting completely drowned into immorality.

13:52.406 --> 13:55.165
The priests, the Brahmins themselves, had become

13:55.365 --> 13:58.205
extremely immoral and

13:58.405 --> 14:03.762
were indulging into all kinds of corrupt practices.

14:12.699 --> 14:15.601
Not only that, but they took to tantric,

14:15.801 --> 14:23.170
tantric manifestations of using spirits and things like that,

14:29.900 --> 14:33.901
and became very self-indulgent.

14:36.822 --> 14:43.385
At that time Buddha, Lord Buddha and Mahavira were born

14:49.354 --> 14:53.503
to de-condition people

14:53.703 --> 14:58.044
from this kind of an extreme behaviour,

15:03.192 --> 15:06.150
because whatever the incarnations tried,

15:06.350 --> 15:10.969
people always went to the extremes.

15:15.763 --> 15:20.712
So, they found out that people were very much indulgent

15:20.912 --> 15:28.079
in killing animals and eating flesh all the time

15:32.435 --> 15:35.679
and if you eat too much of flesh and all that you become

15:35.879 --> 15:39.704
right-sided personality

15:43.345 --> 15:48.273
and so then you become very aggressive

15:51.261 --> 15:54.983
and start killing others.

15:56.808 --> 16:01.134
Moreover, the people who were very much attached to their family

16:01.334 --> 16:04.587
or to their children and all that,

16:04.787 --> 16:10.731
would not do the work of the Divine

16:19.104 --> 16:24.197
and it was a very intensive work which He had to do.

16:26.999 --> 16:31.983
So, He made very strict rules as Moses did.

16:37.135 --> 16:40.681
He said that nobody should kill

16:40.881 --> 16:44.310
any animal and eat it, first of all.

16:50.341 --> 16:56.710
Those who are becoming the munis or the bhikshus

16:56.910 --> 17:01.392
should not even go on any bullock cart;

17:01.592 --> 17:06.322
should walk bare feet; should not even wear shoes.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.213
They should shave their head completely;

17:15.413 --> 17:19.848
should have only three changes, three dresses

17:20.048 --> 17:25.765
with them of a big tunic-like thing.

17:31.074 --> 17:36.292
Whether it is sun or rain, they should not use any umbrellas.

17:42.085 --> 17:46.738
They should eat before six o’clock; before the sun sets.

17:50.307 --> 17:53.696
They should sleep only for five hours

17:55.982 --> 17:59.790
and all the time meditate and ascend

17:59.990 --> 18:04.702
and then try to do the work of the Divine.

18:09.861 --> 18:14.213
Then only they can do the work of the Divine.

18:17.983 --> 18:22.990
After they get their Realization that, He called as Kevalagyan,

18:23.190 --> 18:28.317
only the knowledge, only knowledge, means pure knowledge.

18:33.825 --> 18:36.212
They will develop "Samyak Darshan" means

18:36.412 --> 18:40.476
integrated personality.

18:44.206 --> 18:49.143
And all the collective consciousness He talked of all, all these things

18:51.318 --> 18:53.588
but as He belonged to the Left Side,

18:53.788 --> 18:58.867
He has described Hell very clearly.

19:04.122 --> 19:09.813
Fundamentally, basically, there are fourteen Hells according to Him

19:13.575 --> 19:20.163
and is horrible to read all that what He has described about Hell.

19:23.751 --> 19:25.931
Because He wanted to tell people that,

19:26.131 --> 19:30.837
if you do all these wrong things you will go to Hell

19:36.119 --> 19:41.213
and He talked about, not about form, formly God,

19:41.413 --> 19:45.653
but formless God,

19:49.185 --> 19:54.577
because He didn’t want people to again start ritualism

19:56.587 --> 20:00.371
but get to right, right to the position

20:00.571 --> 20:05.626
where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themselves.

20:10.708 --> 20:15.365
So, you can imagine how difficult in those days at Mahavira

20:15.565 --> 20:22.979
was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization.

20:30.122 --> 20:33.760
It’s frightening for you.

20:35.617 --> 20:42.417
That’s why I never had this puja.

20:45.226 --> 20:49.097
Because to do all these things, first of all,

20:49.297 --> 20:51.830
and to become absolutely pure,

20:52.030 --> 20:56.141
then only He would give Realization.

21:02.734 --> 21:05.446
I wonder how many got realization.

21:05.646 --> 21:12.186
But the way He made rules for people was so strict.

21:20.590 --> 21:22.833
Nobody would have followed Him.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.983
But He told them about the Hell in which they will go

21:26.183 --> 21:29.755
if they don’t follow.

21:34.778 --> 21:38.578
So, they were so frightened that they joined Him

21:38.778 --> 21:43.545
and started following Jainism. ‘Jain’ means ‘the one who has known,

21:43.745 --> 21:48.301
who is enlightened, gnayan.’

21:55.567 --> 21:59.168
Is the, the same word is gnayan means ‘to know.’

21:59.368 --> 22:02.980
‘Ja’ – it means ‘to know.’

22:05.519 --> 22:08.946
Just like the Jews. Is the same word

22:09.146 --> 22:13.336
is the ‘Jew’ means also ‘the one who knows.’

22:15.898 --> 22:19.629
Moses also did the same.

22:21.002 --> 22:23.937
He didn’t say that you should not eat meat

22:24.137 --> 22:28.484
but He said that if anybody is found with another woman

22:28.684 --> 22:32.160
he should be killed.

22:37.512 --> 22:43.756
The Muslims as they follow Sharia is made by Moses for the Jews

22:43.956 --> 22:49.654
because they had become so self-indulgent.

22:52.265 --> 22:56.253
The Sharia that is followed by Muslims

22:56.453 --> 23:00.619
is made by Moses for the Jews

23:07.191 --> 23:10.031
because when He brought those Ten Commandments

23:10.231 --> 23:13.351
He found the Jews were indulging into

23:13.551 --> 23:17.575
all kinds of nonsensical things.

23:22.685 --> 23:25.421
But Jews very nicely put it on the shelf

23:25.621 --> 23:29.375
and the Muslims took to it.

23:34.130 --> 23:41.241
So, now this Mahavira style went to the extreme as usual

23:45.850 --> 23:49.945
even Lord Buddha’s same thing.

23:54.719 --> 23:57.503
Mahavira was the one who said that,

23:57.703 --> 23:59.955
"You should not kill any animal".

24:00.155 --> 24:06.572
So now, in India, we have people who are absolutely abstaining

24:06.772 --> 24:11.264
from even killing bugs and killing even mosquitoes.

24:20.884 --> 24:24.103
How far human beings can go to stupidity

24:24.303 --> 24:28.105
can be seen from this.

24:33.676 --> 24:38.113
Nowadays there’s a custom, very common in India,

24:38.313 --> 24:40.701
that they take get hold of a Brahmin,

24:40.901 --> 24:45.435
put him in a hut and put all the bugs inside

24:52.459 --> 24:58.840
and when these bugs have got completely, have got completely,

24:59.040 --> 25:03.227
fed up with the drinking of the blood of this Brahmin

25:03.427 --> 25:06.427
they just drop out.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.543
Then this Brahmin is paid a big amount by the Jains

25:14.743 --> 25:18.256
who have lots of money.

25:24.407 --> 25:28.654
They are vegetarians to such an extent

25:28.854 --> 25:32.646
that they don’t want to go to the bathroom,

25:32.846 --> 25:35.772
but they’ll go on some sort of a open space

25:35.972 --> 25:39.361
that no animal should die.

25:47.992 --> 25:52.215
Such ridiculous things they do

25:53.738 --> 25:59.842
and in the, in all doing all this abstinence and all that

26:00.042 --> 26:04.090
they are extremely money oriented.

26:08.429 --> 26:12.173
Jains are just like Jews in India.

26:12.373 --> 26:18.235
Jains and Jews are the same in their money orientation.

26:23.766 --> 26:27.416
So, the Jains won’t kill even a bug or a mosquito

26:27.616 --> 26:32.564
but they don’t mind harassing a man up to his death

26:32.764 --> 26:36.295
for their two rupees.

26:46.512 --> 26:52.880
So, this extreme temperament is seen in every religion

26:58.039 --> 27:01.489
and that comes because human beings start moving like

27:01.689 --> 27:05.841
a pendulum from one end to another.

27:09.553 --> 27:13.458
An incarnation comes and tries to bring them in the center

27:13.659 --> 27:18.259
but again they start moving on the other side.

27:22.443 --> 27:24.465
They cannot remain in the center.

27:24.665 --> 27:28.459
This is the problem of the human beings

27:31.660 --> 27:35.732
and this is why all religions look so funny.

27:40.643 --> 27:43.348
When you see the way the Jains are,

27:43.548 --> 27:46.078
I mean, you are surprised and

27:46.278 --> 27:51.793
can’t believe how stupid they are; educated people, doctors,

27:58.832 --> 28:03.904
but they never know that, they never understand that they are stupid.

28:07.618 --> 28:10.156
So, this is the story of Mahavira

28:10.356 --> 28:14.799
where He has tried to bring in a kind...

28:14.999 --> 28:17.315
(…) you will please sit down. Who is that lady?

28:17.515 --> 28:19.942
Don’t move around.

28:20.142 --> 28:22.426
You shouldn’t get up and walk when I am talking.

28:22.626 --> 28:24.705
All right? Tell her.

28:24.906 --> 28:26.728
They are eating, they are walking about.

28:26.928 --> 28:31.642
Will you please tell the Spanish to behave themselves.

28:43.949 --> 28:47.463
When I started Sahaja Yoga, if I’d started like Mahavira

28:47.663 --> 28:51.417
how many would have joined Me?

28:58.257 --> 29:00.555
Even when we have raised the Kundalini,

29:00.755 --> 29:06.329
you have got your Realization there is not much of detachment.

29:15.064 --> 29:17.927
Sanyassi meant that he had nothing to do with his wife,

29:18.127 --> 29:21.769
nothing to do with his children, nothing to do with his family

29:21.969 --> 29:26.937
or house or anything possessions, no possessions.

29:33.302 --> 29:36.512
But...

29:59.423 --> 30:01.423
And...

30:07.593 --> 30:14.087
They were given such a little to eat

30:14.287 --> 30:17.357
without any, just boiled food,

30:17.557 --> 30:25.065
just boiled and such strict order.

30:36.706 --> 30:41.895
But in Sahaja Yoga, I have first of all raised your Kundalini

30:42.095 --> 30:44.848
without telling you any ritual,

30:45.048 --> 30:48.944
any what you can call strictness or anything about it.

30:49.144 --> 30:53.675
Just whatever you are, all right, get your Realization.

31:01.834 --> 31:08.376
And I thought that by raising the Kundalini, by Self-realization,

31:08.576 --> 31:13.098
I need not tell them about Hell.

31:13.298 --> 31:19.594
Only by that, they will become quite detached and wise.

31:27.269 --> 31:31.238
But even now what you find is that there are people

31:31.438 --> 31:38.658
who get married in Sahaja Yoga and just get lost.

31:46.094 --> 31:48.947
Either the wife dominates or the husband dominates

31:49.147 --> 31:53.980
or both of them get completely lost.

31:59.832 --> 32:03.600
Normally, in the Western countries, as soon as they get married,

32:03.800 --> 32:08.880
first, second day they start quarrelling

32:13.307 --> 32:17.918
and within one week they start talking about divorce.

32:20.693 --> 32:23.429
But in Sahaja Yoga, when they get married

32:23.629 --> 32:28.415
they just get attached to each other like glue, you see.

32:33.848 --> 32:37.108
Then there is no other interest left all the time thinking

32:37.308 --> 32:41.965
of wife, wife, wife or husband, husband, husband,

32:47.385 --> 32:51.232
someone to go for honeymoon, someone to do it

32:51.432 --> 32:55.805
in a very big way with a reception and things.

33:01.627 --> 33:05.498
The importance is given so much,

33:05.698 --> 33:07.911
that it is unbelievable that

33:08.111 --> 33:11.396
whatever things we have left to come to Sahaja Yoga

33:11.597 --> 33:15.955
have become multi-fold

33:23.959 --> 33:27.569
and this marriage system that we have started in India

33:27.769 --> 33:31.632
is becoming a headache to Me now.

33:36.084 --> 33:39.373
Either they fight as usual and divorce

33:39.573 --> 33:45.525
or they get glued together. There’s nothing in-between.

33:51.733 --> 33:56.399
They don’t understand that they have married for Sahaja Yoga

34:00.128 --> 34:07.819
and they have to use marriage for Sahaja Yoga only.

34:12.943 --> 34:22.352
But this attitude of Sahaja Yogis is very surprising,

34:22.552 --> 34:25.646
because I always felt after Self-realization

34:25.846 --> 34:30.977
they will be automatically sanyassis from within.

34:40.375 --> 34:44.716
They will themselves be like Mahavira’s disciples.

34:49.095 --> 34:56.857
But what I find is that still they are always falling back into

34:57.057 --> 35:03.130
the same ocean from which they have come on to the boat.

35:09.027 --> 35:12.643
For example, now somebody was fond of seeing films

35:12.843 --> 35:17.430
or, say, football, of all the things football.

35:19.787 --> 35:22.466
So, they are still busy with football.

35:22.666 --> 35:26.316
It's become a craze with football,

35:29.935 --> 35:34.671
or a picnic or a holiday or a sea resort.

35:40.441 --> 35:45.272
After Realization, how can you enjoy these things so much?

35:49.542 --> 35:54.737
That means you have not touched that depth within you yet.

36:00.451 --> 36:03.329
Your depth of joy you have not yet touched.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.885
Still you have to touch it. Once you have touched that

36:06.085 --> 36:12.172
you really don’t care for anything. Just don’t bother for anything.

36:17.796 --> 36:23.399
You are so self-contented you just enjoy your Self.

36:31.378 --> 36:36.313
But I do not know if I should tell you about Hell

36:36.513 --> 36:40.683
and frighten you, or I should put restrictions on you,

36:40.883 --> 36:47.810
but this is the one, Mahavira’s puja, I have been avoiding…

36:48.010 --> 36:51.010
so far.

37:01.103 --> 37:07.103
Even the ladies have to take out all their hair

37:09.185 --> 37:16.851
and wear only white one sari and one blouse, that’s all.

37:20.395 --> 37:24.227
No shoes

37:24.427 --> 37:31.358
and also had to walk. Never get into a bullock cart,

37:31.558 --> 37:35.328
leave alone cars.

37:38.629 --> 37:42.752
They had to get up at four o’clock, have their food till six only

37:42.952 --> 37:46.587
and then sleep off.

37:54.109 --> 37:56.134
There is forty days purgation

37:56.334 --> 38:01.022
when you have to only live on water, only water.

38:05.128 --> 38:10.168
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s the other way round, it’s all enjoyment.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.506
You enjoy everything. You enjoy each other’s company.

38:15.706 --> 38:20.174
You enjoy music. There’s all enjoyment for you.

38:23.222 --> 38:27.265
But without touching your inner enjoyment you cannot,

38:27.465 --> 38:30.741
you cannot ascend. You must touch your inner enjoyment

38:30.941 --> 38:34.953
and then enjoy everything else.

38:44.071 --> 38:48.665
And any hard word said, even one word said hard

38:48.865 --> 38:52.442
they had to repent and go on fast for days together

38:52.642 --> 38:57.223
for saying one harsh word.

39:03.283 --> 39:06.583
But here people go, suddenly I find they are walking nicely

39:06.783 --> 39:10.210
and suddenly they get onto the horse of a ego

39:10.410 --> 39:14.297
and start jumping on others.

39:20.455 --> 39:23.748
The whole, see is so jocular I tell you.

39:23.948 --> 39:27.384
I just watch suddenly what was, he was a nice fellow walking

39:27.585 --> 39:29.462
just now. Suddenly what has happened to him?

39:29.662 --> 39:33.185
Suddenly he started behaving like this.

39:38.598 --> 39:41.351
I never wanted to frighten you about the Hell

39:41.551 --> 39:45.413
but there is Hell, I must say.

39:51.738 --> 39:55.454
And so one has to go deeper into your own enjoyment

39:55.654 --> 39:59.861
so that there is complete contentment.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.500
So, the things that are said about Mahavira

40:10.700 --> 40:13.991
are taken to the extreme that one day He was meditating

40:14.191 --> 40:17.099
and He had only one piece of cloth on Him

40:17.299 --> 40:19.650
wrapped with a dhoti

40:19.850 --> 40:24.008
and He had covered Himself up with one piece of cloth.

40:31.335 --> 40:33.834
So, when He was coming out of his meditation,

40:34.034 --> 40:40.286
his cloth got entangled with some bush.

40:40.486 --> 40:45.005
So, He had to take off half of it.

40:53.417 --> 40:58.458
Then Krishna came to tease Him as an, as a

40:58.658 --> 41:02.404
what do you call, a beggar.

41:06.856 --> 41:10.108
And He said, "You are a king and You can always get

41:10.308 --> 41:12.529
something cloth but I am shivering.

41:12.729 --> 41:17.440
So, why don’t You give me this piece of cloth that You have?"

41:23.464 --> 41:26.103
So, He gave him his cloth

41:26.303 --> 41:29.976
and covered Himself with some leaves and went into his palace

41:30.176 --> 41:32.635
and changed Himself.

41:32.835 --> 41:36.942
Into his house and changed his clothes.

41:43.117 --> 41:45.599
So, these horrible Jains

41:45.799 --> 41:49.450
make his complete nude photographs so huge.

41:49.650 --> 41:52.346
Hundred and fifty feet height nude

41:52.546 --> 41:57.898
absolutely nude into details they work it out, stupid things.

42:07.565 --> 42:09.942
And there are followers of His, so called,

42:10.142 --> 42:12.921
He never had such followers but they call themselves

42:13.121 --> 42:15.042
as "degambaras",

42:15.242 --> 42:18.903
means they do not have cloth but their cloth is all the directions

42:19.103 --> 42:24.508
degambar, directions are their cloth.

42:31.654 --> 42:35.208
And they’ll walk on the street, walk everywhere in the villages

42:35.408 --> 42:39.147
absolutely nude.

42:42.472 --> 42:49.564
I mean, horrible things people do in the name of Mahavira.

42:54.295 --> 42:56.650
Now as you have got Realization

42:56.850 --> 43:01.037
I am sure you won’t go to that extreme.

43:07.339 --> 43:12.959
But still you must learn to have self-discipline.

43:16.562 --> 43:22.095
If you have no self-discipline you cannot jump into that depth,

43:22.295 --> 43:28.264
where there is complete kavalyan, means absolute knowledge,

43:28.464 --> 43:34.305
absolute love and absolute joy.

43:44.658 --> 43:48.458
So, this self-disciplining is very important.

43:48.658 --> 43:51.617
Of course, you need not go to the Mahavira’s extent now,

43:51.817 --> 43:54.740
because luckily I have given you Realization

43:54.940 --> 44:00.075
but still do not go back to things, which you have left.

44:07.604 --> 44:09.860
As men also do stupid things

44:10.060 --> 44:12.928
also women do it in Sahaja Yoga which is surprising.

44:13.128 --> 44:19.486
People told Me that they carry so many make-ups with them to India.

44:27.512 --> 44:31.804
What is the use? I just don’t understand.

44:32.004 --> 44:36.307
To, to, I mean for Indians it is useless

44:36.507 --> 44:39.592
and it is absolutely useless for you also.

44:39.792 --> 44:43.449
You are saints. There is no need to load yourselves

44:43.649 --> 44:48.083
with so many things unnecessarily.

44:54.551 --> 44:57.039
So, if you again indulge into the same nonsense

44:57.239 --> 45:00.110
that you have been doing; going to the hairdresser,

45:00.310 --> 45:03.555
looking funny in the hair, all sorts of things if you do,

45:03.755 --> 45:08.520
then what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

45:14.068 --> 45:16.913
Or following any fashion and these things.

45:17.113 --> 45:19.707
If you have to do the same thing again and again

45:19.907 --> 45:24.320
it is better, you don’t come to Sahaja Yoga.

45:28.809 --> 45:32.665
That’s all I can say. I cannot say like Mahavira that,

45:32.865 --> 45:36.982
"You shave your hair" or "You wear just a white sari".

45:37.182 --> 45:41.817
But I can only say that, "Try to detach yourself".

45:50.693 --> 45:53.231
I was sure with my experiment, that people

45:53.431 --> 45:58.876
when they get Realization, gradually they’ll get detached

46:04.770 --> 46:07.262
and you all have to co-operate with Me:

46:07.462 --> 46:11.487
to see where is your attention.

46:16.328 --> 46:20.645
What are we doing the whole day?

46:20.845 --> 46:24.693
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

46:24.893 --> 46:30.028
How many people we have given Realization?

46:30.647 --> 46:35.632
Everything seems to be important but Sahaja Yoga.

46:39.155 --> 46:44.188
But Mahavira’s day people did not do any jobs, nothing.

46:44.388 --> 46:51.475
They had to live in jungles, they had to beg for their food

47:04.437 --> 47:09.064
and that’s how this Jainism has spread.

47:12.340 --> 47:17.570
But what sort of a Jainism it is, I have told you already.

47:21.032 --> 47:23.744
So, unless and until you touch your depth,

47:23.944 --> 47:26.816
you’ll become like any other religion,

47:27.016 --> 47:35.494
because you won’t be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.

47:46.827 --> 47:50.453
So, we have to work in such a manner that

47:50.653 --> 47:54.978
we understand ourselves and we understand our attention

47:55.178 --> 48:00.043
and we try to ascend.

48:06.775 --> 48:10.532
I don’t have to tell you. You yourself have to work it out

48:10.732 --> 48:13.210
in such a manner that you touch your depth

48:13.410 --> 48:19.029
and you become an ascetic within yourself.

48:25.362 --> 48:33.004
Then only you will be really doing the Divine work properly

48:33.204 --> 48:37.573
with proper understanding.

48:43.423 --> 48:47.683
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these great prophets

48:47.883 --> 48:52.217
and these incarnations.

48:57.927 --> 49:01.471
So, I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings

49:01.671 --> 49:03.965
and all that, to get rid of them,

49:04.165 --> 49:08.896
you must get out of this ocean of illusion.

49:17.269 --> 49:22.873
So, this is the only thing I can just now say about Mahavira

49:23.073 --> 49:27.325
but lots can be said because of the, He deals with the past.

49:27.525 --> 49:32.937
All his past lives and everything are described,

49:41.032 --> 49:43.380
but that is not so important. What is important

49:43.580 --> 49:47.453
is what is today, the present.

49:51.107 --> 49:54.081
I hope my lecture goes into your head

49:54.281 --> 49:58.805
and settles into your heart

50:03.344 --> 50:07.716
and you understand what you have to do about yourself,

50:07.916 --> 50:13.033
about your ascent. You have to be genuine people.

50:18.152 --> 50:23.149
Then only it is going to show results in the whole world.

50:30.697 --> 50:35.321
I hope you will pass this tape to all the people

50:35.521 --> 50:41.870
so they should know why I didn’t have Mahavira’s Puja all these years.

50:49.361 --> 50:53.330
May God bless you all!
