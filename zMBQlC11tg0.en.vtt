00:00:01.698 --> 00:00:08.421
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Shri Mahavira

00:03:43.284 --> 00:03:50.308
Shri Mahavira Puja. Barcelona (Spain), 17 June 1990.

00:03:52.403 --> 00:03:56.083
Today we are going to do the puja of Mahavira

00:03:56.283 --> 00:04:00.696
and we never had this puja before.

00:04:08.968 --> 00:04:12.254
The reason for this was that

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:19.061
Mahavira’s life was an ascetic’s life,

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:28.036
just like Buddha.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.677
Even more than Buddha it would be

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:41.521
because at the time when these two were born,

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:53.779
the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form.

00:04:59.543 --> 00:05:01.947
People had become extremely ritualistic

00:05:02.147 --> 00:05:05.106
and they were worshipping all kinds of stones

00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:11.160
and all kinds of things instead of worshipping only the swayambu.

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:25.860
Who is that fellow eating food at the time of puja?

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:30.212
There is a gentleman who is eating food at the time of a –

00:05:30.412 --> 00:05:33.905
Please tell him.

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:54.300
Let it be, let it be open (the window).

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:01.764
The ascetic life of Mahavira

00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:05.805
was of a very, very extreme nature.

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:23.253
He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kshatriyas,

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:31.671
and then He was also married.

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:38.669
Also, He had a daughter

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:43.458
and then He decided – because He knew He had

00:06:43.658 --> 00:06:49.449
to do the work of the Divine –

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:53.181
He decided to take a sanyasa.

00:06:59.584 --> 00:07:01.669
So, He took the permission of his brother,

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:04.122
because his parents were dead.

00:07:04.322 --> 00:07:08.447
He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth,

00:07:08.647 --> 00:07:13.604
everything and He became a complete sanyasi.

00:07:25.317 --> 00:07:33.654
And He left his family, left his house everything behind

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:40.817
and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.523
And the people who joined Him were very few

00:07:54.723 --> 00:07:59.993
and He asked them that, "You have to also become ascetics, munis."

00:08:06.803 --> 00:08:10.383
He was a reincarnation of St. Michael

00:08:14.242 --> 00:08:18.709
and He resides on the Left Side,

00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:22.540
on the Ida Nadi.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.993
And He looks after the whole of it,

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:31.161
right from Mooladhara onwards up to the Sahasrara.

00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:41.590
So, St Michael was born as Mahavira,

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:49.506
meaning the greatest warrior.

00:08:52.082 --> 00:08:58.049
But when He was born, the whole place got lot of prosperity.

00:08:58.249 --> 00:09:02.406
That’s why He was called as Vardhaman, to begin with.

00:09:12.144 --> 00:09:17.278
But his asceticism was there because of the Brahminism

00:09:17.478 --> 00:09:19.397
that was so prevalent in those days,

00:09:19.597 --> 00:09:24.246
and people were absolutely drowned into it.

00:09:31.293 --> 00:09:36.585
After Shri Krishna, these two persons, Buddha and Mahavira,

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:40.821
both of them incarnated in India.

00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:51.272
As you know, their history is very far out because

00:09:51.472 --> 00:09:56.047
they were the children of Rama and they were two twins,

00:09:56.247 --> 00:10:00.383
called as Lav and Kush.

00:10:07.322 --> 00:10:12.305
So, Rama led a life of a very great king,

00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:16.544
benevolent king, and of lots of limitations,

00:10:16.744 --> 00:10:19.744
mariada Purushottama.

00:10:25.998 --> 00:10:31.366
Because of that, people became extremely serious and

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:40.792
also very closed, because of Rama’s following.

00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:49.829
Of course, after every incarnation,

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:53.393
as they do not get their Realization, they get deviated

00:10:53.593 --> 00:10:58.386
and start going to the extremes of everything.

00:11:04.945 --> 00:11:10.745
So, they went to the extremes and became very, very much –

00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:14.328
sort of quiet people wouldn’t talk to anyone

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:17.415
and would be very formal sort of people,

00:11:17.615 --> 00:11:22.798
because that was the life Rama had to live, lead.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.976
And because Rama left his wife, many people at that time

00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:42.581
felt that wife is not to be paid so much attention to.

00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:55.651
So, Shri Krishna came. Actually, Rama took birth as Shri Krishna

00:11:55.851 --> 00:11:58.851
to overcome these conditionings.

00:12:06.807 --> 00:12:10.823
And He said, "All this is lila. This is all a play."

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:17.984
And that it is a play and you should have pure heart

00:12:18.184 --> 00:12:20.904
and you can play about.

00:12:21.104 --> 00:12:24.904
There is, as long as you have pure character,

00:12:25.104 --> 00:12:30.581
nothing can go wrong if you mix up with people freely.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:43.500
So, after Shri Krishna, people started becoming

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.288
very licentious and permissive

00:12:54.654 --> 00:12:59.041
and they created poems and things of Krishna’s love stories,

00:12:59.241 --> 00:13:02.728
which was all false.

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:10.869
Because He lived with Radha at the age of five or six years,

00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:14.982
and with the, in the Gokul.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.750
So, all these false stories about Him were used

00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:29.737
for the licentiousness of the people.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:41.690
So now, the situation was such, that the whole place

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.961
was getting completely drowned into immorality.

00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:55.165
The priests, the Brahmins themselves, had become

00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:58.205
extremely immoral and

00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:03.762
were indulging into all kinds of corrupt practices.

00:14:12.699 --> 00:14:15.601
Not only that, but they took to tantric,

00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:23.170
tantric manifestations of using spirits and things like that,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.901
and became very self-indulgent.

00:14:36.822 --> 00:14:43.385
At that time Buddha, Lord Buddha and Mahavira were born

00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:53.503
to de-condition people

00:14:53.703 --> 00:14:58.044
from this kind of an extreme behaviour,

00:15:03.192 --> 00:15:06.150
because whatever the incarnations tried,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.969
people always went to the extremes.

00:15:15.763 --> 00:15:20.712
So, they found out that people were very much indulgent

00:15:20.912 --> 00:15:28.079
in killing animals and eating flesh all the time

00:15:32.435 --> 00:15:35.679
and if you eat too much of flesh and all that you become

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:39.704
right-sided personality

00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:48.273
and so then you become very aggressive

00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:54.983
and start killing others.

00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:01.134
Moreover, the people who were very much attached to their family

00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:04.587
or to their children and all that,

00:16:04.787 --> 00:16:10.731
would not do the work of the Divine

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:24.197
and it was a very intensive work which He had to do.

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:31.983
So, He made very strict rules as Moses did.

00:16:37.135 --> 00:16:40.681
He said that nobody should kill

00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:44.310
any animal and eat it, first of all.

00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:56.710
Those who are becoming the munis or the bhikshus

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.392
should not even go on any bullock cart;

00:17:01.592 --> 00:17:06.322
should walk bare feet; should not even wear shoes.

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.213
They should shave their head completely;

00:17:15.413 --> 00:17:19.848
should have only three changes, three dresses

00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:25.765
with them of a big tunic-like thing.

00:17:31.074 --> 00:17:36.292
Whether it is sun or rain, they should not use any umbrellas.

00:17:42.085 --> 00:17:46.738
They should eat before six o’clock; before the sun sets.

00:17:50.307 --> 00:17:53.696
They should sleep only for five hours

00:17:55.982 --> 00:17:59.790
and all the time meditate and ascend

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.702
and then try to do the work of the Divine.

00:18:09.861 --> 00:18:14.213
Then only they can do the work of the Divine.

00:18:17.983 --> 00:18:22.990
After they get their Realization that, He called as Kevalagyan,

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:28.317
only the knowledge, only knowledge, means pure knowledge.

00:18:33.825 --> 00:18:36.212
They will develop "Samyak Darshan" means

00:18:36.412 --> 00:18:40.476
integrated personality.

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:49.143
And all the collective consciousness He talked of all, all these things

00:18:51.318 --> 00:18:53.588
but as He belonged to the Left Side,

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:58.867
He has described Hell very clearly.

00:19:04.122 --> 00:19:09.813
Fundamentally, basically, there are fourteen Hells according to Him

00:19:13.575 --> 00:19:20.163
and is horrible to read all that what He has described about Hell.

00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:25.931
Because He wanted to tell people that,

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:30.837
if you do all these wrong things you will go to Hell

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:41.213
and He talked about, not about form, formly God,

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:45.653
but formless God,

00:19:49.185 --> 00:19:54.577
because He didn’t want people to again start ritualism

00:19:56.587 --> 00:20:00.371
but get to right, right to the position

00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:05.626
where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themselves.

00:20:10.708 --> 00:20:15.365
So, you can imagine how difficult in those days at Mahavira

00:20:15.565 --> 00:20:22.979
was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization.

00:20:30.122 --> 00:20:33.760
It’s frightening for you.

00:20:35.617 --> 00:20:42.417
That’s why I never had this puja.

00:20:45.226 --> 00:20:49.097
Because to do all these things, first of all,

00:20:49.297 --> 00:20:51.830
and to become absolutely pure,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.141
then only He would give Realization.

00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:05.446
I wonder how many got realization.

00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:12.186
But the way He made rules for people was so strict.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.833
Nobody would have followed Him.

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:25.983
But He told them about the Hell in which they will go

00:21:26.183 --> 00:21:29.755
if they don’t follow.

00:21:34.778 --> 00:21:38.578
So, they were so frightened that they joined Him

00:21:38.778 --> 00:21:43.545
and started following Jainism. ‘Jain’ means ‘the one who has known,

00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:48.301
who is enlightened, gnayan.’

00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:59.168
Is the, the same word is gnayan means ‘to know.’

00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:02.980
‘Ja’ – it means ‘to know.’

00:22:05.519 --> 00:22:08.946
Just like the Jews. Is the same word

00:22:09.146 --> 00:22:13.336
is the ‘Jew’ means also ‘the one who knows.’

00:22:15.898 --> 00:22:19.629
Moses also did the same.

00:22:21.002 --> 00:22:23.937
He didn’t say that you should not eat meat

00:22:24.137 --> 00:22:28.484
but He said that if anybody is found with another woman

00:22:28.684 --> 00:22:32.160
he should be killed.

00:22:37.512 --> 00:22:43.756
The Muslims as they follow Sharia is made by Moses for the Jews

00:22:43.956 --> 00:22:49.654
because they had become so self-indulgent.

00:22:52.265 --> 00:22:56.253
The Sharia that is followed by Muslims

00:22:56.453 --> 00:23:00.619
is made by Moses for the Jews

00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:10.031
because when He brought those Ten Commandments

00:23:10.231 --> 00:23:13.351
He found the Jews were indulging into

00:23:13.551 --> 00:23:17.575
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:23:22.685 --> 00:23:25.421
But Jews very nicely put it on the shelf

00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:29.375
and the Muslims took to it.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:41.241
So, now this Mahavira style went to the extreme as usual

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.945
even Lord Buddha’s same thing.

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.503
Mahavira was the one who said that,

00:23:57.703 --> 00:23:59.955
"You should not kill any animal".

00:24:00.155 --> 00:24:06.572
So now, in India, we have people who are absolutely abstaining

00:24:06.772 --> 00:24:11.264
from even killing bugs and killing even mosquitoes.

00:24:20.884 --> 00:24:24.103
How far human beings can go to stupidity

00:24:24.303 --> 00:24:28.105
can be seen from this.

00:24:33.676 --> 00:24:38.113
Nowadays there’s a custom, very common in India,

00:24:38.313 --> 00:24:40.701
that they take get hold of a Brahmin,

00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:45.435
put him in a hut and put all the bugs inside

00:24:52.459 --> 00:24:58.840
and when these bugs have got completely, have got completely,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.227
fed up with the drinking of the blood of this Brahmin

00:25:03.427 --> 00:25:06.427
they just drop out.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.543
Then this Brahmin is paid a big amount by the Jains

00:25:14.743 --> 00:25:18.256
who have lots of money.

00:25:24.407 --> 00:25:28.654
They are vegetarians to such an extent

00:25:28.854 --> 00:25:32.646
that they don’t want to go to the bathroom,

00:25:32.846 --> 00:25:35.772
but they’ll go on some sort of a open space

00:25:35.972 --> 00:25:39.361
that no animal should die.

00:25:47.992 --> 00:25:52.215
Such ridiculous things they do

00:25:53.738 --> 00:25:59.842
and in the, in all doing all this abstinence and all that

00:26:00.042 --> 00:26:04.090
they are extremely money oriented.

00:26:08.429 --> 00:26:12.173
Jains are just like Jews in India.

00:26:12.373 --> 00:26:18.235
Jains and Jews are the same in their money orientation.

00:26:23.766 --> 00:26:27.416
So, the Jains won’t kill even a bug or a mosquito

00:26:27.616 --> 00:26:32.564
but they don’t mind harassing a man up to his death

00:26:32.764 --> 00:26:36.295
for their two rupees.

00:26:46.512 --> 00:26:52.880
So, this extreme temperament is seen in every religion

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:01.489
and that comes because human beings start moving like

00:27:01.689 --> 00:27:05.841
a pendulum from one end to another.

00:27:09.553 --> 00:27:13.458
An incarnation comes and tries to bring them in the center

00:27:13.659 --> 00:27:18.259
but again they start moving on the other side.

00:27:22.443 --> 00:27:24.465
They cannot remain in the center.

00:27:24.665 --> 00:27:28.459
This is the problem of the human beings

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.732
and this is why all religions look so funny.

00:27:40.643 --> 00:27:43.348
When you see the way the Jains are,

00:27:43.548 --> 00:27:46.078
I mean, you are surprised and

00:27:46.278 --> 00:27:51.793
can’t believe how stupid they are; educated people, doctors,

00:27:58.832 --> 00:28:03.904
but they never know that, they never understand that they are stupid.

00:28:07.618 --> 00:28:10.156
So, this is the story of Mahavira

00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:14.799
where He has tried to bring in a kind...

00:28:14.999 --> 00:28:17.315
(…) you will please sit down. Who is that lady?

00:28:17.515 --> 00:28:19.942
Don’t move around.

00:28:20.142 --> 00:28:22.426
You shouldn’t get up and walk when I am talking.

00:28:22.626 --> 00:28:24.705
All right? Tell her.

00:28:24.906 --> 00:28:26.728
They are eating, they are walking about.

00:28:26.928 --> 00:28:31.642
Will you please tell the Spanish to behave themselves.

00:28:43.949 --> 00:28:47.463
When I started Sahaja Yoga, if I’d started like Mahavira

00:28:47.663 --> 00:28:51.417
how many would have joined Me?

00:28:58.257 --> 00:29:00.555
Even when we have raised the Kundalini,

00:29:00.755 --> 00:29:06.329
you have got your Realization there is not much of detachment.

00:29:15.064 --> 00:29:17.927
Sanyassi meant that he had nothing to do with his wife,

00:29:18.127 --> 00:29:21.769
nothing to do with his children, nothing to do with his family

00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:26.937
or house or anything possessions, no possessions.

00:29:33.302 --> 00:29:36.512
But...

00:29:59.423 --> 00:30:01.423
And...

00:30:07.593 --> 00:30:14.087
They were given such a little to eat

00:30:14.287 --> 00:30:17.357
without any, just boiled food,

00:30:17.557 --> 00:30:25.065
just boiled and such strict order.

00:30:36.706 --> 00:30:41.895
But in Sahaja Yoga, I have first of all raised your Kundalini

00:30:42.095 --> 00:30:44.848
without telling you any ritual,

00:30:45.048 --> 00:30:48.944
any what you can call strictness or anything about it.

00:30:49.144 --> 00:30:53.675
Just whatever you are, all right, get your Realization.

00:31:01.834 --> 00:31:08.376
And I thought that by raising the Kundalini, by Self-realization,

00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:13.098
I need not tell them about Hell.

00:31:13.298 --> 00:31:19.594
Only by that, they will become quite detached and wise.

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:31.238
But even now what you find is that there are people

00:31:31.438 --> 00:31:38.658
who get married in Sahaja Yoga and just get lost.

00:31:46.094 --> 00:31:48.947
Either the wife dominates or the husband dominates

00:31:49.147 --> 00:31:53.980
or both of them get completely lost.

00:31:59.832 --> 00:32:03.600
Normally, in the Western countries, as soon as they get married,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.880
first, second day they start quarrelling

00:32:13.307 --> 00:32:17.918
and within one week they start talking about divorce.

00:32:20.693 --> 00:32:23.429
But in Sahaja Yoga, when they get married

00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:28.415
they just get attached to each other like glue, you see.

00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:37.108
Then there is no other interest left all the time thinking

00:32:37.308 --> 00:32:41.965
of wife, wife, wife or husband, husband, husband,

00:32:47.385 --> 00:32:51.232
someone to go for honeymoon, someone to do it

00:32:51.432 --> 00:32:55.805
in a very big way with a reception and things.

00:33:01.627 --> 00:33:05.498
The importance is given so much,

00:33:05.698 --> 00:33:07.911
that it is unbelievable that

00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:11.396
whatever things we have left to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:33:11.597 --> 00:33:15.955
have become multi-fold

00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:27.569
and this marriage system that we have started in India

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:31.632
is becoming a headache to Me now.

00:33:36.084 --> 00:33:39.373
Either they fight as usual and divorce

00:33:39.573 --> 00:33:45.525
or they get glued together. There’s nothing in-between.

00:33:51.733 --> 00:33:56.399
They don’t understand that they have married for Sahaja Yoga

00:34:00.128 --> 00:34:07.819
and they have to use marriage for Sahaja Yoga only.

00:34:12.943 --> 00:34:22.352
But this attitude of Sahaja Yogis is very surprising,

00:34:22.552 --> 00:34:25.646
because I always felt after Self-realization

00:34:25.846 --> 00:34:30.977
they will be automatically sanyassis from within.

00:34:40.375 --> 00:34:44.716
They will themselves be like Mahavira’s disciples.

00:34:49.095 --> 00:34:56.857
But what I find is that still they are always falling back into

00:34:57.057 --> 00:35:03.130
the same ocean from which they have come on to the boat.

00:35:09.027 --> 00:35:12.643
For example, now somebody was fond of seeing films

00:35:12.843 --> 00:35:17.430
or, say, football, of all the things football.

00:35:19.787 --> 00:35:22.466
So, they are still busy with football.

00:35:22.666 --> 00:35:26.316
It's become a craze with football,

00:35:29.935 --> 00:35:34.671
or a picnic or a holiday or a sea resort.

00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:45.272
After Realization, how can you enjoy these things so much?

00:35:49.542 --> 00:35:54.737
That means you have not touched that depth within you yet.

00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:03.329
Your depth of joy you have not yet touched.

00:36:03.529 --> 00:36:05.885
Still you have to touch it. Once you have touched that

00:36:06.085 --> 00:36:12.172
you really don’t care for anything. Just don’t bother for anything.

00:36:17.796 --> 00:36:23.399
You are so self-contented you just enjoy your Self.

00:36:31.378 --> 00:36:36.313
But I do not know if I should tell you about Hell

00:36:36.513 --> 00:36:40.683
and frighten you, or I should put restrictions on you,

00:36:40.883 --> 00:36:47.810
but this is the one, Mahavira’s puja, I have been avoiding…

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.010
so far.

00:37:01.103 --> 00:37:07.103
Even the ladies have to take out all their hair

00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:16.851
and wear only white one sari and one blouse, that’s all.

00:37:20.395 --> 00:37:24.227
No shoes

00:37:24.427 --> 00:37:31.358
and also had to walk. Never get into a bullock cart,

00:37:31.558 --> 00:37:35.328
leave alone cars.

00:37:38.629 --> 00:37:42.752
They had to get up at four o’clock, have their food till six only

00:37:42.952 --> 00:37:46.587
and then sleep off.

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:56.134
There is forty days purgation

00:37:56.334 --> 00:38:01.022
when you have to only live on water, only water.

00:38:05.128 --> 00:38:10.168
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s the other way round, it’s all enjoyment.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.506
You enjoy everything. You enjoy each other’s company.

00:38:15.706 --> 00:38:20.174
You enjoy music. There’s all enjoyment for you.

00:38:23.222 --> 00:38:27.265
But without touching your inner enjoyment you cannot,

00:38:27.465 --> 00:38:30.741
you cannot ascend. You must touch your inner enjoyment

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:34.953
and then enjoy everything else.

00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:48.665
And any hard word said, even one word said hard

00:38:48.865 --> 00:38:52.442
they had to repent and go on fast for days together

00:38:52.642 --> 00:38:57.223
for saying one harsh word.

00:39:03.283 --> 00:39:06.583
But here people go, suddenly I find they are walking nicely

00:39:06.783 --> 00:39:10.210
and suddenly they get onto the horse of a ego

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:14.297
and start jumping on others.

00:39:20.455 --> 00:39:23.748
The whole, see is so jocular I tell you.

00:39:23.948 --> 00:39:27.384
I just watch suddenly what was, he was a nice fellow walking

00:39:27.585 --> 00:39:29.462
just now. Suddenly what has happened to him?

00:39:29.662 --> 00:39:33.185
Suddenly he started behaving like this.

00:39:38.598 --> 00:39:41.351
I never wanted to frighten you about the Hell

00:39:41.551 --> 00:39:45.413
but there is Hell, I must say.

00:39:51.738 --> 00:39:55.454
And so one has to go deeper into your own enjoyment

00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:59.861
so that there is complete contentment.

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:10.500
So, the things that are said about Mahavira

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.991
are taken to the extreme that one day He was meditating

00:40:14.191 --> 00:40:17.099
and He had only one piece of cloth on Him

00:40:17.299 --> 00:40:19.650
wrapped with a dhoti

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:24.008
and He had covered Himself up with one piece of cloth.

00:40:31.335 --> 00:40:33.834
So, when He was coming out of his meditation,

00:40:34.034 --> 00:40:40.286
his cloth got entangled with some bush.

00:40:40.486 --> 00:40:45.005
So, He had to take off half of it.

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:58.458
Then Krishna came to tease Him as an, as a

00:40:58.658 --> 00:41:02.404
what do you call, a beggar.

00:41:06.856 --> 00:41:10.108
And He said, "You are a king and You can always get

00:41:10.308 --> 00:41:12.529
something cloth but I am shivering.

00:41:12.729 --> 00:41:17.440
So, why don’t You give me this piece of cloth that You have?"

00:41:23.464 --> 00:41:26.103
So, He gave him his cloth

00:41:26.303 --> 00:41:29.976
and covered Himself with some leaves and went into his palace

00:41:30.176 --> 00:41:32.635
and changed Himself.

00:41:32.835 --> 00:41:36.942
Into his house and changed his clothes.

00:41:43.117 --> 00:41:45.599
So, these horrible Jains

00:41:45.799 --> 00:41:49.450
make his complete nude photographs so huge.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.346
Hundred and fifty feet height nude

00:41:52.546 --> 00:41:57.898
absolutely nude into details they work it out, stupid things.

00:42:07.565 --> 00:42:09.942
And there are followers of His, so called,

00:42:10.142 --> 00:42:12.921
He never had such followers but they call themselves

00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:15.042
as "degambaras",

00:42:15.242 --> 00:42:18.903
means they do not have cloth but their cloth is all the directions

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:24.508
degambar, directions are their cloth.

00:42:31.654 --> 00:42:35.208
And they’ll walk on the street, walk everywhere in the villages

00:42:35.408 --> 00:42:39.147
absolutely nude.

00:42:42.472 --> 00:42:49.564
I mean, horrible things people do in the name of Mahavira.

00:42:54.295 --> 00:42:56.650
Now as you have got Realization

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:01.037
I am sure you won’t go to that extreme.

00:43:07.339 --> 00:43:12.959
But still you must learn to have self-discipline.

00:43:16.562 --> 00:43:22.095
If you have no self-discipline you cannot jump into that depth,

00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:28.264
where there is complete kavalyan, means absolute knowledge,

00:43:28.464 --> 00:43:34.305
absolute love and absolute joy.

00:43:44.658 --> 00:43:48.458
So, this self-disciplining is very important.

00:43:48.658 --> 00:43:51.617
Of course, you need not go to the Mahavira’s extent now,

00:43:51.817 --> 00:43:54.740
because luckily I have given you Realization

00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:00.075
but still do not go back to things, which you have left.

00:44:07.604 --> 00:44:09.860
As men also do stupid things

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.928
also women do it in Sahaja Yoga which is surprising.

00:44:13.128 --> 00:44:19.486
People told Me that they carry so many make-ups with them to India.

00:44:27.512 --> 00:44:31.804
What is the use? I just don’t understand.

00:44:32.004 --> 00:44:36.307
To, to, I mean for Indians it is useless

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:39.592
and it is absolutely useless for you also.

00:44:39.792 --> 00:44:43.449
You are saints. There is no need to load yourselves

00:44:43.649 --> 00:44:48.083
with so many things unnecessarily.

00:44:54.551 --> 00:44:57.039
So, if you again indulge into the same nonsense

00:44:57.239 --> 00:45:00.110
that you have been doing; going to the hairdresser,

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.555
looking funny in the hair, all sorts of things if you do,

00:45:03.755 --> 00:45:08.520
then what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:45:14.068 --> 00:45:16.913
Or following any fashion and these things.

00:45:17.113 --> 00:45:19.707
If you have to do the same thing again and again

00:45:19.907 --> 00:45:24.320
it is better, you don’t come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:32.665
That’s all I can say. I cannot say like Mahavira that,

00:45:32.865 --> 00:45:36.982
"You shave your hair" or "You wear just a white sari".

00:45:37.182 --> 00:45:41.817
But I can only say that, "Try to detach yourself".

00:45:50.693 --> 00:45:53.231
I was sure with my experiment, that people

00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:58.876
when they get Realization, gradually they’ll get detached

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.262
and you all have to co-operate with Me:

00:46:07.462 --> 00:46:11.487
to see where is your attention.

00:46:16.328 --> 00:46:20.645
What are we doing the whole day?

00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:24.693
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:46:24.893 --> 00:46:30.028
How many people we have given Realization?

00:46:30.647 --> 00:46:35.632
Everything seems to be important but Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:39.155 --> 00:46:44.188
But Mahavira’s day people did not do any jobs, nothing.

00:46:44.388 --> 00:46:51.475
They had to live in jungles, they had to beg for their food

00:47:04.437 --> 00:47:09.064
and that’s how this Jainism has spread.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:17.570
But what sort of a Jainism it is, I have told you already.

00:47:21.032 --> 00:47:23.744
So, unless and until you touch your depth,

00:47:23.944 --> 00:47:26.816
you’ll become like any other religion,

00:47:27.016 --> 00:47:35.494
because you won’t be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.

00:47:46.827 --> 00:47:50.453
So, we have to work in such a manner that

00:47:50.653 --> 00:47:54.978
we understand ourselves and we understand our attention

00:47:55.178 --> 00:48:00.043
and we try to ascend.

00:48:06.775 --> 00:48:10.532
I don’t have to tell you. You yourself have to work it out

00:48:10.732 --> 00:48:13.210
in such a manner that you touch your depth

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:19.029
and you become an ascetic within yourself.

00:48:25.362 --> 00:48:33.004
Then only you will be really doing the Divine work properly

00:48:33.204 --> 00:48:37.573
with proper understanding.

00:48:43.423 --> 00:48:47.683
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these great prophets

00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:52.217
and these incarnations.

00:48:57.927 --> 00:49:01.471
So, I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings

00:49:01.671 --> 00:49:03.965
and all that, to get rid of them,

00:49:04.165 --> 00:49:08.896
you must get out of this ocean of illusion.

00:49:17.269 --> 00:49:22.873
So, this is the only thing I can just now say about Mahavira

00:49:23.073 --> 00:49:27.325
but lots can be said because of the, He deals with the past.

00:49:27.525 --> 00:49:32.937
All his past lives and everything are described,

00:49:41.032 --> 00:49:43.380
but that is not so important. What is important

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:47.453
is what is today, the present.

00:49:51.107 --> 00:49:54.081
I hope my lecture goes into your head

00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:58.805
and settles into your heart

00:50:03.344 --> 00:50:07.716
and you understand what you have to do about yourself,

00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:13.033
about your ascent. You have to be genuine people.

00:50:18.152 --> 00:50:23.149
Then only it is going to show results in the whole world.

00:50:30.697 --> 00:50:35.321
I hope you will pass this tape to all the people

00:50:35.521 --> 00:50:41.870
so they should know why I didn’t have Mahavira’s Puja all these years.

00:50:49.361 --> 00:50:53.330
May God bless you all!
