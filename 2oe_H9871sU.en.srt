1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,760
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,880
Definitely it is evident today

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,799
that you have come here all the way in the rain

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,840
to seek the truth, that you are real seekers.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,399
And the real seekers

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
will find the real way.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,698
Whatever they may do, whatever wrong path they may take,

8
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,884
they may identify themselves with wrong things also,

9
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:51,812
and may oppose in the beginning the truth,

10
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:57,400
but ultimately they will all find the real path,

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,735
as long as they do not try to deceive themselves.

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,158
The awakening of the Kundalini

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,839
is not a new thing as you people may be thinking.

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,439
It has been done since

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,351
sixteenth century back,

16
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:31,089
when it is said Indra, the God King,

17
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:33,719
was given Realization.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,694
So you can imagine,

19
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,113
that is called as Siddhendra,

20
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:44,840
means the Indra first made a hole here.

21
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:49,399
And there’s a place where it was done in India.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,246
It’s a very ancient thing,

23
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:53,719
and at the time of Rama also,

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,996
there was a fellow called Nachiketa

25
00:01:56,197 --> 00:02:00,748
who came to Rama’s father-in-law, Janaka,

26
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:05,590
and asked Him if he could get his Self Realization.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,919
And the father-in-law said that

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,519
“You can ask anything but not for your Realization.”

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,989
He said, “No, I don’t want anything else but Realization”.

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,496
And they say that He put him to test, many a times, for years,

31
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:24,799
and then he was the first who got Realization,

32
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,775
at the time of Shri Rama.

33
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:34,614
It is very interesting that how this system of Self Realization,

34
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:38,928
was kept more or less exclusive, and rather secretive,

35
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:43,010
because the people would like always

36
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:47,310
to use this method to make some money out of it;

37
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:51,081
that they would not respect the reality,

38
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:56,299
and would learn, say about your chakras, Kundalini,

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,920
this, that, few words and start selling books

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,320
or posing that they are born again,

41
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:05,638
and impressing others with it,

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,798
and try to make some cults or some sort of groups,

43
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:14,359
just forming into some falsehood.

44
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:18,199
And that is the reason this was kept quite a secret.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,799
But on the right hand side of the seeking,

46
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:26,799
they tried to find out the ways and methods

47
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:31,559
how to initiate the elements within us, the casual of elements,

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,519
first to initiate the causal of the elements,

49
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,959
by which we could control the elements for our own purpose.

50
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,319
This was one way where they called it as the Yagnya and all that.

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,536
And that’s how the Vedas were written.

52
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:48,999
Veda means vida, means to know.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,653
These were written to say that you have to know.

54
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:55,880
And at the very beginning of the Vedas, it is written

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,022
that after reading this book, throughout,

56
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:02,654
if you have not known the truth,

57
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:05,679
it is of no use to you.

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,439
The very first stanza says so.

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,310
So the whole thing was done with that idea,

60
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:15,627
and in the ancient country of India,

61
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,963
they started working on the right side

62
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:21,688
to know this subtle body

63
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:25,184
or the subtle Deities of all the elements

64
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:28,760
so that they could master the elements; this was first idea.

65
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:33,713
On the left hand side, they started another kind of a search,

66
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,800
in believing that there is God,

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,440
and we have to ask the help of God.

68
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,773
And they started praying,

69
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:45,039
first to Primordial Mother,

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,399
because in every religion there is a place for the Mother.

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,519
There’s no religion which does not believe in the Primordial Mother.

72
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,440
You can say that at the time of Mohammed Sahib,

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,159
He didn’t talk much about it, because the time was such.

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,229
But His own daughter

75
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,467
was an incarnation of the Primordial Mother,

76
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,439
whose name was Fatima Bi.

77
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,931
And the two sons that were born to Her, are the sons

78
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:19,166
who came on this earth also as Mahavira and Buddha.

79
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:21,393
And they were born even earlier.

80
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:24,045
Like that, they were born again and again,

81
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:28,400
as these two elements, as the disciples, as two disciples.

82
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,061
And you can see if you read their life,

83
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:35,559
their character, their behavior, you’ll be surprised,

84
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,199
how these two characters have been born again and again,

85
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,640
in different times, to suggest two personalities

86
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,919
of two types, who have been seeking God,

87
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,562
and who have been trying to understand God

88
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,121
through their personality as disciples;

89
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:56,599
and how they reached a conclusion

90
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,560
after taking a kind of a position in life.

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,360
Now for example Buddha preached that

92
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:07,159
there should be complete non-violence,

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,626
and also Mahavira said so, there should be non-violence.

94
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:14,160
But they carried it to such an extent.

95
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:17,931
that Mahavira’s disciples started saving the bugs.

96
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:21,243
They would get some bugs from the village,

97
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,267
put them in a hut

98
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:27,479
and put a Brahmin inside that – fanaticism at that stage -

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,580
and the bugs would eat,

100
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:35,999
or take, take out the blood of that poor brahmin,

101
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,319
and when they would be all filled with blood,

102
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,359
then they would give money to this brahmin.

103
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,079
Such extreme vegetarianism or extreme type of ahinsa!

104
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,998
Or another type of Buddha’s ahinsa that started

105
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,799
that Buddha was not the one who was a vegetarian,

106
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,520
because He died, at the end you know that,

107
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,719
He ate the meat of a boar which was not properly cooked.

108
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:04,942
So this kind of extreme type of

109
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:08,998
food-oriented religion started out of them,

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,618
so they got themselves born again,

111
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,957
as Hassan and Hussein and [unclear]

112
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:21,718
that when it come to righteousness,

113
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:25,611
when it comes to the [fight] for righteousness, you have to fight.

114
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,102
That time the one who doesn't fight

115
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:32,039
is not a person who is a religious person.

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,907
So the idea of all these people was in such a way

117
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:44,057
that the time at that period was such and such,

118
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:48,359
and at that period this was the proper thing to be done.

119
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,440
Now we can see the example of Christ is.

120
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,312
Christ came at a time

121
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:57,159
where the Son of God had to manifest.

122
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
And He came at a time where He had to forgive,

123
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,960
and He had to show to people how stupid they were, to crucify Him,

124
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,960
so that they could repent for what stupidity they have done.

125
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:15,320
And that’s how He came on this earth.

126
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,170
But when He will come again,

127
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:21,199
He’s not going to come in that way.

128
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,974
The Second Advent of Christ,

129
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,359
is going to be a very serious one.

130
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,640
When He will come, He will have eleven destroying powers.

131
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,999
With that He will destroy all that is useless,

132
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,560
all that has gone wasted, all those fanatics

133
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,256
or "Whom they'll call <<Christ, Christ>>, I won’t know”,

134
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:42,920
He’s told that, very well.

135
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:46,360
All these things He’s going to absolutely finish off.

136
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,280
And those who are realized souls,

137
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:53,799
who have entered into the Kingdom of God, will be only saved.

138
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,560
And this is what is described in all the Scriptures.

139
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,947
Of course somebody calls them, say Islam calls it “Mahdi”

140
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,640
in India He is called as “Kalki”,

141
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:08,320
in the Bible He is called as “the Christ on the white horse”.

142
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,120
He is called by various names,

143
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,840
but it is definite that He is going to come,

144
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,485
and when He comes,

145
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:19,414
then He is not going to bother as to tell you, and convince you,

146
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,634
and to counsel you or to redeem you and give you Realization.

147
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:27,999
That time, He is not going to bother about it.

148
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,960
He is going to come in pure destructive form,

149
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,771
where He will destroy all that is useless.

150
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:38,483
And to understand this, if you see
the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo,

151
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:41,640
you can see Him clearly standing, at the Agnya chakra,

152
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,599
with a robust body, throwing people up and down.

153
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,320
Those who call, “Christ, Christ”, He throws them down,

154
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,287
because they did not do anything what Christ has asked for.

155
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,898
Now the people should know

156
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:58,160
what we have got out of anything whatsoever.

157
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,880
You may be identified with any cult, with any idea,

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,840
with any group, or anything,

159
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,358
but always must know what you have you got out of it.

160
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,719
For example, I would say for Christians it is necessary to know

161
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,720
that Christ has said a very strong thing,

162
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,480
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

163
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
Let us find out, do we have innocent eyes?

164
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,638
If we don’t, we are not Christians.

165
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
How do we have innocent eyes?

166
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,998
How do we develop our innocence, is the problem.

167
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,279
And to develop our innocence we have to awaken the Kundalini.

168
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,465
When the Kundalini is awakened, the first center

169
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,799
of innocence is awakened.

170
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:46,319
At that time all the excretion work of the body just stops,

171
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:53,014
and this center of Mooladhara, informs the Kundalini,

172
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:57,280
that “There is somebody who knows the job and You can rise.”

173
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,560
Then only the Kundalini rises.

174
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,781
This center of innocence is first awakened within us.

175
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:09,319
If this center finds that the person is anti-God,

176
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,640
he is anti-Christ,

177
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,120
he is a man who is a devil, or any sort of a thing,

178
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,880
it just does not allow the Kundalini to rise.

179
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,120
I have seen people with absolute frozen Kundalini;

180
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:25,760
I have seen people who have nothing to do with Kundalini,

181
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,925
we can say they are just like devils

182
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:31,959
and they have no way that they can be realized.

183
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,545
But ninety-nine percent people in this world

184
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,200
are excellent people, good people,

185
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:41,680
and out of them I think at least

186
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,719
thirty to forty percent people are seeking God.

187
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,320
Not all; some are seeking money, some are seeking power

188
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,680
and some are seeking some personal indulgences.

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,600
But there are definitely true seekers on this earth,

190
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:00,727
and this thirty percent people are, or forty percent people,

191
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,319
are the most important people from the God’s point of view.

192
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,120
You might be anything. You might be having any organization,

193
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,799
you might be having any position in life,

194
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,560
you might be any great personality, makes no difference to God.

195
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,999
What is important is that are you seeking?

196
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,880
If you’re not, the door will be opened has been promised.

197
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,400
But if you think you have already achieved it

198
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,439
and that you are there, how can it be worked out?

199
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,960
So one has to be humble about it, and allow the Kundalini to rise

200
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,848
in Its own glory, giving you your real beauty.

201
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,719
Now the thing we have to know that

202
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,999
as the Kundalini ascends, we also start getting powers.

203
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,799
The first power is that of innocence.

204
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:55,107
Innocence has a power above all other powers.

205
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,319
It’s the most powerful thing,

206
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,102
but in the human beings it takes time

207
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:03,555
for innocence to be awakened in the full way.

208
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:07,079
It takes time. As a child they have the innocence;

209
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,240
and in childhood, if they get their awakening

210
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,799
that’s the best thing that can happen to human beings

211
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,320
that in the childhood only they become, get their Realization.

212
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,439
But as soon as you start growing

213
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,559
your attention starts going either to the left or to the right.

214
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,520
You start indulging into all kinds of things

215
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
as far as your sex is concerned,

216
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,408
as far as your seeking is concerned,

217
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,459
and you then jump on to some sort of a wrong thing

218
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,322
which you should not have done.

219
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:39,172
And that’s how the first center gets lost.

220
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:43,440
An innocent person is looked after by angels.

221
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,622
Such a person has no fear of anything.

222
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:50,930
He’s not bothered, he’s never violent, he’s never hasty,

223
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,079
he’s never in a temper, he’s so peaceful,

224
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,520
and he knows that what he is doing is the right thing.

225
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,998
Such a person stands by righteousness.

226
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,319
Like you can see in the life of Christ is a very good example

227
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,925
that when Mary Magdalene was stoned by people, He stood up,

228
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:14,159
and He said, “Among you who has done no sin

229
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,999
can throw the stone at her.”

230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,160
Actually Christ had nothing to do with a prostitute.

231
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,920
He had no relationship of any kind with her.

232
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,999
She is a prostitute and He is the Son of God.

233
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,999
But at that time He did feel that she has a right to exist,

234
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,080
because those who are stoning her

235
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:36,760
are the people who have committed also sins.

236
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:40,799
Only she is a person who’s exposed, and He stood by her.

237
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,572
And that is what happens to a person who is innocent

238
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:44,958
he is fearless.

239
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,880
He has no fear of anything,

240
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,400
because he knows that he stands on truth and on innocence.

241
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,600
Such a person also has a capacity to bear up lots of nonsense,

242
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,520
to laugh at lots of tortures and troubles people bestow upon him.

243
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,173
And the greatest thing of innocence is,

244
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,279
that it gives you discretion.

245
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,974
Such a person is immensely discreet. He’s so wise.

246
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:14,359
He may be a little child, he may be a grown-up person,

247
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,479
he may be a villager, he might be educated,

248
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,759
he might be uneducated, but he’s so wise

249
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,006
that he sees what is right and what is righteous.

250
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,799
And this is the greatest quality of an innocent person,

251
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:31,680
that he’s very discreet about everything.

252
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,240
His discretion is just like a straight forward hit.

253
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,519
He doesn’t have to think, he doesn’t have to bother.

254
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,999
Whatever he decides is absolute discreet,

255
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,079
and he doesn’t have to have choices.

256
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,510
He doesn’t go on choosing people, he doesn’t go on choosing things.

257
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,639
He said, “This is the thing” – finished.

258
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,799
So, such a person becomes absolutely dynamic

259
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:57,799
because he doesn’t waste any energy, he doesn’t waste his brains,

260
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,880
he doesn’t waste his arguments with anyone.

261
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,640
If he thinks a person is worth arguing, he’ll argue,

262
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,399
otherwise he’ll say, “All right, you are clever. Go ahead.”

263
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,909
This is the understanding of a person,

264
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,880
who is completely discreet.

265
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,600
Like there was a very big joke about it, that

266
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,160
there was a man who was going up the road,

267
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,159
up the stairs, and another one was coming downstairs.

268
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,400
The one who was going up the road was a wise man

269
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,199
and the one who was coming down was not a wise man.

270
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,519
So he tried to be aggressive, so, and he told him

271
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,279
that “I will not move for you, because I don’t move for fools.”

272
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,940
So the other one moved on one side and he said, “I do.”

273
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,480
Meaning, “I move out for fools,”

274
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,798
you see, but he said, “I do.” And he moved out.

275
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:57,119
So he has such a discretion – how far to go and how far not to go.

276
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,360
Now, I will give you an example how

277
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,120
in nature you can find this very easily.

278
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,479
See, the root has a little root cap.

279
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,640
It’s a very, very small minute thing,

280
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,799
you have to see through the microscope.

281
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:12,725
Now this root cap is a wise thing.

282
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,329
It goes in the soil, it sees there are some stones,

283
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,118
so it goes around the stones.

284
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,398
Then it finds there are boulders. It goes around the boulders.

285
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,935
It has to find its way, so it's not bothered.

286
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:25,839
“You are a boulder? All right, doesn’t matter,

287
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,473
I am not going to fight with you.”

288
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:31,069
It passes through that, it goes directly

289
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,080
to that place where it has to arrive,

290
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,610
and when it reaches that place, when he arrives that place,

291
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:41,332
what happens, he finds that he has tied up these boulders

292
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:45,040
around himself to support the whole tree.

293
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:50,720
This is the wisdom of a little bit, small little cell

294
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
which is the root-end.

295
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,960
So you can imagine how much there is wisdom

296
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,799
in a little cell like that.

297
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,960
And God has given us such a good brain

298
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,400
and if we do not have discretion

299
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,799
we are like people who are blind,

300
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,439
who walk without knowing where they have to go.

301
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,720
So the first power of your innocence is awakened.

302
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,560
Innocent men cannot be harmed.

303
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,798
Those who try to harm the innocent men are harmed ultimately.

304
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:31,600
They are very severely harmed, and it is amazing sometimes

305
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,240
that the harm can be too much, too severe

306
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,360
and that’s why the compassion of Christ thought of it,

307
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,120
and He said, “Oh God, please forgive them,

308
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,760
for they do not know what they are doing.”

309
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,999
Because it could have been that

310
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,960
with the Father who is so wrathful,

311
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,799
they would have been all destroyed completely.

312
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,798
So the way He said, “Forgive them,

313
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,360
because I do not want

314
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
that these people, who are ignorant people,

315
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,440
who have tortured Me like this, should be destroyed.”

316
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,450
This is the sign of innocence.

317
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,039
Then the second chakra, when it is awaken within you,

318
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,711
you have a special quality of creativity.

319
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,799
Because when the second chakra is awaken,

320
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,888
you are actually thoughtless, there’s no thought in your mind.

321
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:29,579
So you start looking at anything, without thinking.

322
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,760
You start looking at anything that is created

323
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:38,279
without any ripple of thought in your mind.

324
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,559
Like all that is created round the lake of your mind

325
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,928
is completely reflected in that ripple-less lake,

326
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:54,799
and you see the complete reflection of that creation,

327
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:59,799
as well as the joy that is bubbling in that creation.

328
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,799
So your creativity becomes tremendous.

329
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:06,382
You start seeing things, but not thinking about it.

330
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,799
Now, see if you come to this hall,

331
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,399
and you start seeing something, you like it,

332
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,320
then you start thinking, “Oh God, this is a beautiful thing,

333
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,799
but how much it must have cost? And now how old it is?

334
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,999
Is it going to last or not? Is it insured or not?”

335
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,080
All sorts of funny ideas will come to you,

336
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,264
and you’ll never enjoy what it is.

337
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,879
But supposing you have no thought about it,

338
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,799
you just watch it, you just see it.

339
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,880
What happens? The creation that of the artist

340
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,919
who has created this beautiful thing,

341
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,639
the joy of that creation that the artist had -

342
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,097
who might be dead now - you start enjoying that joy.

343
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:48,097
The whole thing can be filled in you with that bubbling joy

344
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,931
that he wanted to put there with his own heart.

345
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:55,040
And that’s what happens because there is no thought.

346
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,799
So the creativity becomes tremendous.

347
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,240
But it’s not only that the creativity is tremendous,

348
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:02,999
but your techniques even.

349
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,440
For example, a musician can become a tremendous musician.

350
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,320
People who have never done any work, can become extremely powerful.

351
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,399
We have somebody here from India.

352
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,198
The other day he was telling people,

353
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,577
because he gave one of the lectures,

354
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,226
that “I had never seen what is wood is.

355
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:24,799
I did not know what was teak, what was other wood and all that.”

356
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:26,799
And he had no job when he came to Me.

357
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:29,490
And he said, “Now, after Realization what job should I take?”

358
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:32,202
I said, “You take to interior decoration”, and he got a shock.

359
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:33,999
He said, “I don’t know what [to do].

360
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,867
How am I to take interior decoration?”

361
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:38,280
I said, “You can start feeling the vibrations.

362
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,160
You just do it on the basis on vibrations.”

363
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,999
And he did it, and he made a big money out of it,

364
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,120
because as I told you the other day,

365
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,240
whatever is absolutely beautiful you think,

366
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,080
has nothing in it but has vibrations.

367
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,399
It has a coefficient which gives you vibrations.

368
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,040
Like Mona Lisa now. We like her, Mona Lisa.

369
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,639
According to modern standards she cannot be a beauty

370
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,860
because she was a very plump lady, an elderly lady.

371
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:07,560
But today also, if you go there, you cannot see her painting,

372
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,720
it’s so crowded, everybody’s anxious to see Mona Lisa.

373
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,799
And if you go and feel the vibrations,

374
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,799
from distance you’ll get vibrations,

375
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,800
because the coefficients of her body, face and everything

376
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,999
is made so well, that you get the vibrations.

377
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,998
Now people are very anxious to create new ideas,

378
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,287
new type of things, and these,

379
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:30,714
but these things do not sell

380
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:34,440
and even if they sell temporarily, they have no eternal values.

381
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,320
So the people with this chakra enlightened,

382
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,935
start creating things of very eternal values,

383
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,248
of universal values.

384
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,463
Anywhere you take such a thing, you will take it to India,

385
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:53,040
you take it to China, you take it to Japan or you take it to America

386
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,999
anywhere, any human being who sees that,

387
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,799
sees the beauty of the Spirit,

388
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,760
because it gives you joy in your Spirit.

389
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,799
So the pure art is produced [through you].

390
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,220
That’s the purity,

391
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,280
or I would say the holy art is produced through you.

392
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,234
When you start producing that holy art, then you should believe

393
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:20,799
that you have got an enlightenment on that chakra.

394
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,011
This chakra has another capacity,

395
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,892
to transform your fat, for the use of your brain.

396
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:30,880
And it works very hard for that, when you start thinking too much.

397
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,922
And by that over thinking,

398
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,566
what happens, that you develop all the diseases

399
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:38,520
of the organs which it has to look after.

400
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Like, it has to look after the liver,

401
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,799
it has to look after the pancreas, it has to look after the spleen,

402
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:48,000
it has to look after the parts of the intestine and the uterus.

403
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,967
So what happens that when you use this chakra

404
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:55,879
only for the use of thinking and thinking and thinking,

405
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,360
all these things go out of order.

406
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,615
And one by one you start developing diseases like diabetes,

407
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,434
and then you start developing diseases of the stomach,

408
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:11,071
and sometimes the spleen, and all other diseases

409
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,299
which are very dangerous, that the,

410
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,196
as you can call the blood cancer and all those things,

411
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:18,759
out of this kind of mad thinking.

412
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,040
Now to tell you that you shouldn’t think too much,

413
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,432
you shouldn’t bother too much, you should not be wobbly,

414
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,226
you should take things easy, be light-hearted,

415
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,274
is not possible in the modern times

416
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,319
because we are slaves of the watch.

417
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,679
But what happens, that when you get Realization,

418
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
your thinking process becomes regulated.

419
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
You only think when you have to think.

420
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:43,799
You just go on thinking, thinking, like horns coming out.

421
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,119
You don’t think like that. You only think when you have to think.

422
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,158
And whatever you think comes from you inspiration as such.

423
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,120
Now for time, you see, My watch is always out of order.

424
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,998
I deliberately keep it out of order, because the time is

425
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,040
in your hands.

426
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,840
Supposing these people will hurry Me up too much,

427
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,142
“Mother we have go now, we’ll miss
the plane, this thing, that thing.”

428
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,131
 I said, “All right, if you say I’ll go.”

429
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:14,028
I go to the airport

430
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:16,439
and there they find the plane is three hours late.

431
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
Then they said, “Mother, why didn’t you tell us?”

432
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:21,120
I said, “I was telling you, no need to hurry up.

433
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,879
Why didn’t you telephone and find out?

434
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,240
If you had telephoned, we would not have been there earlier.”

435
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,256
So you see, you start seeing

436
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:33,929
that this time is best for this, this time is best for that.

437
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,411
You don’t have to become a slave of the watch.

438
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:38,947
Like this, people become such slaves

439
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:43,999
that they arrive at a point where there can be

440
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,240
some sort of a wrong thing happening

441
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,999
or maybe that you reach the place
and you have to wait for four hours,

442
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,026
you have to do all kinds of arrangements

443
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:55,938
to make yourself comfortable.

444
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,080
Or sometimes it so happens that you quarrel with your wife,

445
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,471
quarrel with your husband, quarrel with your children,

446
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:03,413
“Oh, we are getting late, we are getting late

447
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:04,730
we have to be on the time.”

448
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,798
All this madness comes to people

449
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,400
because they have not got their Realization.

450
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,320
Once you get Realization, you station down.

451
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,360
You are very much at ease with yourself.

452
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,719
You don’t hurry others and you don’t trouble others.

453
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,239
Like small, small things, how much we trouble by our worries.

454
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,000
You see, human beings will go on saying, “I’m worried.”

455
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,920
But what’s the use of worrying? Now if I tell you, “Don’t worry”

456
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,304
you cannot stop it.

457
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,520
But once the hole is made here,

458
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,720
which we call the Brahmarandhra is opened,

459
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,280
then there’s a hole out of which the worry comes out,

460
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
and then you just cannot worry.

461
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Even if you want to worry, you won’t worry;

462
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:46,800
because somehow or other you go beyond that nonsense of worrying.

463
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
In any way, mentally I cannot convince you that you don’t worry.

464
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,920
But once you get Realization, you’ll be amazed,

465
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
you’ll be just enjoying yourself.

466
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,840
Even if you are late, you are not going to bother about

467
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
or trouble others and you will find

468
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,200
that you’ll be are always in time for things,

469
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,160
because there is a force,

470
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,680
this All Pervading Power of God looks after you.

471
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,280
You start believing in it, how it works out.

472
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,120
You won’t believe how much it helps,

473
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,600
how much it works out, how it can operate

474
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,999
just beyond description.

475
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,646
I mean, I’ll tell you a story which you won’t believe.

476
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:26,635
Did I tell them yesterday about the boy who fainted?

477
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,559
SY: I don't think so, Mother.
SM: No.

478
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,799
SM: A story about Myself,

479
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:33,799
and then a story about Warren I can tell you.

480
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,720
It’s in the newspaper, so you can believe it.

481
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,200
I was giving a lecture in Bedford

482
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,480
and that was from seven to ten

483
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,240
and about eight o’clock a boy fell down somewhere,

484
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,799
about I don’t know ten-fifteen miles from a bridge.

485
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:52,280
Very deep down he fell down from his motorbike.

486
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,650
And they sent for an ambulance.

487
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:57,170
They got frightened; they thought this boy must be dead,

488
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,399
to fall down to this extent.

489
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,800
So the ambulance came in and when the ambulance came in,

490
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,160
this boy just walked up, and he came up

491
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,920
and he sat in the ambulance.

492
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,799
So they said, “How are you?”

493
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,799
He said “I’m all right, nothing wrong with me.”

494
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,601
So they said, “But nothing happened to you.”

495
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:14,480
He said, “No, I broke lots of things

496
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,086
but a Lady came in a white clothes,

497
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:19,652
in a white Mercedes (that’s My car),

498
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:22,999
and She walked down up to me and She cured me.

499
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,040
And only She left the lower portion of my bone,

500
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,480
and She said that, <<You come for this to Me>>,

501
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:32,680
and the rest is I’m perfectly all right, see."

502
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:34,720
They couldn’t believe it, you see.

503
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,320
And the police was there, and everybody was there.

504
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,447
And the next day he saw My photograph in the newspaper,

505
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:43,520
and he informed them, he informed the police,

506
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,444
“This is the Lady Who came and cured me.”

507
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:47,520
So they telephoned our people, and ask them,

508
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,840
“Did She pass this way that day?”

509
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,240
They said, “That time She was just giving lecture

510
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,639
before six hundred people. She was not there.”

511
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,799
So they were quite amazed, how it has happened. But it can happen.

512
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:59,240
It’s nothing new. I mean it has happened many a times.

513
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,200
But one of these that has appeared in the newspaper is like that.

514
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,999
Now, how does this happen?

515
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,640
God has got wonderful television also, perfect,

516
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,080
it’s so systematic, it’s so scientific.

517
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,919
How it works, that for that you have to just see and wonder.

518
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,719
He has got telecommunication, He has got computers,

519
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,120
He has got everything that you have created,

520
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,993
but extremely efficient and methodical.

521
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:27,879
You don’t have to worry, it just works out.

522
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,439
There are so many things that have happened,

523
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,720
like you have heard that Christ gave bread,

524
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,799
five bread and fish to so many people.

525
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:39,240
It’s nothing new to now Sahaja Yogis.

526
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,999
They have seen this many a times happening,

527
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,840
in our groups and in our camps.

528
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,879
But another thing which is not believable

529
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,120
but it has happened to one Mr. Warren,

530
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,998
Dr. Warren, who is here from Australia.

531
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,799
When he came to India and he got his Realization,

532
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,266
and when he went back he said,

533
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:58,375
“I must now start talking about Sahaja Yoga

534
00:29:58,576 --> 00:30:00,160
and giving Realization to people.”

535
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,360
And when he went back to Australia there was a petrol crisis.

536
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,439
And there was no petrol in his car, about to finish,

537
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,333
so they thought, “Now, what to do?

538
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:13,080
We’ll not have any petrol. How to do Mother’s work?”

539
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,649
So they said, “Lets try.

540
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:18,520
We’ll just go wherever we want, we’ll not look at the petrol.”

541
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,480
And they did this for twenty-one days, continuously,

542
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,622
and when they went to the petrol pump after twenty-one days,

543
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:28,639
because the petrol pumps had opened out,

544
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,879
the petrol pump fellow said that,

545
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:35,799
“There is hardly one liter space there. What am I to fill in?”

546
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:39,280
And they were amazed, they did it twenty-one days. It can happen.

547
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,798
You do not know when you say God is Almighty,

548
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:45,800
when we say that He can do whatever He wants to do.

549
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,160
He does everything.

550
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,880
When we say that we are not aware that what He can do.

551
00:30:51,152 --> 00:30:55,078
We just think that at the most He can make flowers into fruits,

552
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,799
at the most He can make our heart beat,

553
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,879
at the most He can make us from amoeba to human being.

554
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,799
But just think of it,

555
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:06,319
how far He can go,

556
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,560
and how capable He is

557
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,309
and how full of compassion He is for His own creation.

558
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,400
Now you have to enter into that area.

559
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,760
First of all, unless and until you are there,

560
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,680
you are really blessed by God,

561
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,069
you cannot believe it how it helps.

562
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,999
Thirdly, the third center, is the center of your seeking,

563
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,560
as he has told you, is the center of your seeking.

564
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,680
Now the seeking gets satisfied

565
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,080
in the sense that you feel you are no more to seek,

566
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,000
now you have to give.

567
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,600
You are asking for the light,

568
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,799
you have got the light, and you have to give the light.

569
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:54,292
But you do not develop the fanatic attitude

570
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:58,034
that, “I am the right person, and you are the wrong person”

571
00:31:58,236 --> 00:32:01,022
and that kind of a violent nature,

572
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:04,760
but you develop a very gentle and a kindly

573
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:07,200
and affectionate nature towards that person.

574
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,040
Because you have gone through that kind of an experience,

575
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,560
so you know that this person is ignorant.

576
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,600
Gradually when he will see the light, he will understand.

577
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,680
So you don’t force your way onto him, at all.

578
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,877
On the contrary you allow that person to slowly

579
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:27,639
take to it, and awaken his Kundalini and see for himself

580
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,680
so that he should certify himself.

581
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,040
You don’t force him to say things,

582
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,876
you do not organize him,

583
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,487
you do not make him a member,

584
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:39,798
you do not take money from him, nothing.

585
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,040
You leave him alone. If he wants to come, he can come.

586
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,923
If he does not want to come, he need not come.

587
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:49,120
In Sahaja Yoga, we have made it compulsory

588
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,959
that all the centers we are running,

589
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,320
no young boys should come who are below age

590
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,080
without the permission of their parents,

591
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,480
even to visit, leave alone living there.

592
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,040
So that, that’s how we allow only those people

593
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,599
who are grown up, adults, to come with their own wishes.

594
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,132
They are not to be forced.

595
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,803
If they want to go today, we’ll say, “All right, go just now.”

596
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:16,640
There is no compulsion on anyone,

597
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
because one thing you must know, that you cannot compel

598
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,799
as far as your Self Realization is concerned.

599
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,880
Because it is of no use.

600
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,840
It has to come through your freedom,

601
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,159
through your asking, otherwise we cannot work it out.

602
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,120
Unless and until you ask for it, we cannot do it,

603
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,600
it is an impossibility.

604
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,966
So you must understand that

605
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:41,992
I cannot force you to get Realization.

606
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:43,480
It has to work out.

607
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,534
If it works out, you are a lucky person. I cannot guarantee it.

608
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,679
If it works out that means it is your own,

609
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,280
and if it has not worked out and if you want to work Me out

610
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,920
or anybody to work it out, they’ll work it out.

611
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,799
But it cannot be guaranteed, it cannot be promised.

612
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,200
So your seeking stops and what happens

613
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,869
that you start looking at yourself

614
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,523
and seeing your own glory,

615
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:13,719
and understanding your own powers,

616
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,960
get yourself cleaned out,

617
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,013
and you want to give others that solace that you have got,

618
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:23,560
that Realization that you have got.

619
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,120
So, I always say that I’m the greatest capitalist,

620
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,695
because if I have all the powers I’m the greatest capitalist,

621
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:32,799
and I’m the greatest communist

622
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:35,600
because I cannot live without distributing you.

623
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,720
I must distribute. When we talk of capitalism,

624
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,998
what do you have? These stones? What do you have?

625
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,879
What do you distribute? The stones?

626
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,840
And what are you a communist? What are you distributing?

627
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,239
Only stones.

628
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,998
So there is nothing to be proud of these worldly possessions.

629
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,879
What you are to be proud of,

630
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,159
or to be conscious of, is your Spirit.

631
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,320
Spirit is the only thing that can kindle another Spirit.

632
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,799
I have not seen any matter can kindle that joy in anyone.

633
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:07,287
At the most if you give some matter to somebody, at the most,

634
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:10,814
that is the only advantage of having some material thing is

635
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:12,558
that you can give away,

636
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,080
that you can express your love through some material things.

637
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,320
But otherwise the matter has no value of any kind.

638
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:22,200
But Spirit has absolute value,

639
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,440
because it can kindle light into another’s life,

640
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,960
and there cannot be anything better than to be given to anyone else.

641
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,200
No amount of money, no amount of empires,

642
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,080
nothing can give that which is the Spirit,

643
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,360
because the Spirit is the ultimate.

644
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,007
After that you don’t seek anything.

645
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,720
That’s what is the Kundalini, is the true desire

646
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,800
which wants to become the reality,

647
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,799
which wants to become the divinity.

648
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:54,160
To get divinity within you is the highest thing,

649
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,160
and that’s what once you get,

650
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,760
you don’t want anything else.

651
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,640
So the seeking starts improving.

652
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,679
Around the seeking are the Ten Commandments, you can say,

653
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,182
or the ten primordial masters.

654
00:36:07,383 --> 00:36:10,600
There are many others, but the primordial masters, the ten,

655
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,799
who came on this earth, one after another,

656
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:14,984
to teach us how to balance ourselves.

657
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:18,279
After Realization I’ve seen people automatically balance.

658
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,040
I don’t tell them anything about Ten Commandments.

659
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,400
I don’t say “Don’t”, I never say.

660
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,386
I said, “You get your Realization.”

661
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:28,798
Once they get Realization they just start

662
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:32,799
behaving in such a manner that is extremely righteous,

663
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:36,759
extremely balanced, extremely holy.

664
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,399
Such a person becomes immediately

665
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,160
rid of all the horrible habits they have,

666
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,587
all the enslavement of passion, and lust and greed.

667
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:51,519
Everything drops out just like that,

668
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,131
and like a beautiful lotus they come out of that mire,

669
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:02,799
that darkness, into light.

670
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:07,038
And then in the light they see it so clearly,

671
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,359
that this is not the thing that I can have,

672
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,799
this is not the thing that I can wear,

673
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,720
and immediately they give it up.

674
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,560
That’s how you become a new personality.

675
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,826
This religion is born within you.

676
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:23,370
Now we talk of religion, this religion that religion, that religion.

677
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:25,319
Everybody is talking of different religions

678
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,920
and dogmas, and this and that,

679
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:29,120
and only fighting everywhere you go.

680
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,720
They are fighting among each other, it’s still going on.

681
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,439
It’s endless; they are all fighting morning till evening.

682
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,440
Then I have seen also some people who try to unite religions

683
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,919
and there also they have nothing but all the devils put together,

684
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,799
all devils joined together to unite.

685
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,240
There is nothing of reality in them.

686
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,999
So the people are puzzled, “What is happening to religion?”

687
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,520
These organized religions also can be very dangerous.

688
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,600
They can put you into such norms that you can really

689
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,520
get absolutely brain-washed,

690
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,320
and you start believing that what you are doing is correct,

691
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,120
without understanding why are you doing it.

692
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,560
Most of the things tell, “This is a mystery, that is a mystery.”

693
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,360
Then why, what are you doing there?

694
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,397
If it is a mystery, it is better you give up.

695
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:15,291
But they’ll just brand you that “This is mystery, that is mystery”.

696
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,679
You have to accept.

697
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,920
But what is the advantage of that kind of a life,

698
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,319
nobody wants to see.

699
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,759
As I told you, that Christ has asked for one thing,

700
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:26,600
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

701
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,729
and let us see which religious organization

702
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,520
has granted that to people.

703
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,975
It’s only your Spirit, when It is awakened and reborn,

704
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:39,239
you can have that innocence within you.

705
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,640
As it is today, it’s getting late,

706
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,160
but I have to tell you that the chakras

707
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,720
as he explained, I am just giving you the powers of every chakra.

708
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,746
And the power of the chakra of heart is tremendous.

709
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,499
It gives you the fearlessness.

710
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:03,840
When the child is about twelve years of age,

711
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,798
in this sternum bone, the antibodies are created by this chakra.

712
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,134
And they are sent all over the body

713
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:15,798
to fight the disease or any kind of an attack on the personality.

714
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:20,880
Now, these are actually looked after by the deity in that center,

715
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,640
and this deity, when gets the message,

716
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:31,799
She informs all the antibodies that “You have to fight.”

717
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:35,649
And all of them will go at that point, join together,

718
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:39,999
to fight the enemy of life, enemy of God.

719
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:44,439
Like now we are having, now I’m here,

720
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,999
and Americans are to be realized,

721
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,759
and we have to do something about America.

722
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:54,319
Then knowing that how America is important -

723
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,798
I’ll tell you where America is in this body -

724
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:01,600
people from Australia, from India,

725
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,359
from France, from all over,

726
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,999
have come down here.

727
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:11,000
All the way they have come,

728
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,039
just to give Realization to Americans.

729
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,919
All of them. I never forced anybody, I never asked anybody,

730
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,880
they just came forward, “Mother, we are going to go with You,

731
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,754
and we are going to do this great work of Realization

732
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,359
to people of America who are seekers.”

733
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,840
They all have come on their own, spending their own money,

734
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,105
and they are doing this work with Me.

735
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:40,804
So you can image what a great attraction it must be,

736
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:45,200
what a great attachment it must be, for the seekers of America,

737
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,760
that they have come all the way. They are all people on big jobs

738
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:51,928
one is a doctor, another is an architect, another is this,

739
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:55,799
all of them sacrificing their money, everything, time

740
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:59,718
have come down here to be with Me for these two months

741
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,130
to work for America, from all over.

742
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:04,847
We have some people who are actresses

743
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:11,129
in the English drama

744
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:14,360
or some are directors and things like that.

745
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,080
They all have come here.

746
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,960
In your Boston we have at least,

747
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,799
I think, ten people from ten countries.

748
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:26,788
So you can imagine how is the whole attention, the priority.

749
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,160
This is the important thing. They must get Realization.

750
00:41:30,451 --> 00:41:32,520
They do not get any money out of it;

751
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,799
they do not get any reward out of it,

752
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:38,919
only the satisfaction that so many have got Realization.

753
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:42,360
The more, the merrier. When they see more people coming

754
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,798
getting Realization, you must see their faces, they lit up.

755
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,240
This kind of a personality people have not seen.

756
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,399
I had one bishop

757
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,558
who came to stay with Me in My house in London,

758
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,960
and when he saw Sahaja Yogis, he said,

759
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,999
“This is a rare caste and community. I have never seen such a...

760
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,240
So I’ve been telling people to do little things

761
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,880
in life, they cannot do it and look at these people,

762
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,160
how beautiful they are. I can’t believe how can they be so nice.”

763
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560
Because your Spirit is beautiful,

764
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,600
the Spirit is glorious,

765
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,640
and when you become that,

766
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,920
automatically it starts manifesting its beauty.

767
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,999
You don’t have to tell yourself, you’ll be amazed at yourself

768
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,359
how you have become so beautiful,

769
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,920
and so good and so nice.

770
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,560
So this quality of fearlessness comes to you

771
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,799
because your antibodies

772
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:38,359
are completely charged with the power of the Spirit.

773
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,080
And you start understanding what sort of a disease is coming,

774
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,560
what sort of an attack is coming,

775
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,923
and your body knows how to fight it.

776
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:50,240
You know how to fight it, and when you know that,

777
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:52,631
you are not afraid of any disease whatsoever,

778
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:54,279
even it is cancer, anything,

779
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,159
people know how to fight it themselves and for others.

780
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,439
Now the higher chakra is of Vishuddhi chakra

781
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,920
and this chakra is what America is.

782
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,359
In the Universe this is the chakra,

783
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,938
Vishuddhi chakra, is what America represents.

784
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:16,520
Because America has a responsibility,

785
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,664
this center has the responsibility.

786
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:21,307
When they raise the head,

787
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:25,920
human beings, then this center developed

788
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,028
the responsibility to be human beings.

789
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,799
And the responsibility of spirituality

790
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:35,823
lies on the shoulders of Americans.

791
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,970
You had great people like Abraham Lincoln,

792
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:45,399
very great people here professing about

793
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,200
freedom of your country and big ideal things.

794
00:43:50,563 --> 00:43:54,240
But to My dismay I find: where are those gone?

795
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,110
Where are those people

796
00:43:56,311 --> 00:43:59,040
who will take the responsibility of spirituality?

797
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,320
They are lost with fake gurus, they are lost with cults,

798
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,679
they are lost with all kinds of things and where are they?

799
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,999
It’s such a sad thing that the responsibility

800
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,279
which was on the shoulders of Americans

801
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,480
has been not properly tackled, at all.

802
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:19,920
But now the time is – though we start slowly,

803
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,240
let us take up the responsibility and see for ourselves,

804
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,799
what we can do for our countrymen, for our people,

805
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,399
and on the hole for the whole world.

806
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,839
You can do a lot, because that is your specialty

807
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,232
that is your job, which has to be done.

808
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:41,040
Now this chakra gives you the power to be the witness.

809
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,080
First power you get that you become the witness

810
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,480
– witness of everything. The whole thing becomes like a drama,

811
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,319
like you are in the water, and then you suddenly come in a boat

812
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,400
and you start seeing the play of all these waves.

813
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,386
You are no more afraid, you just start seeing it as a drama;

814
00:44:58,588 --> 00:44:59,973
you become a witness.

815
00:45:00,174 --> 00:45:02,448
The second thing that happens to you with this,

816
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:04,960
that you become collectively conscious.

817
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,359
Your hands, if this chakra is good, start feeling the cool breeze,

818
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,719
start feeling the chakras of yourself and chakras of other people.

819
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,239
With your hands you can cure people,

820
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,560
with your hands you can raise the Kundalini,

821
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:20,480
with your hands you can give Realization.

822
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,642
These hands become powerful things.

823
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Even the movement of these hands has a meaning;

824
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,167
everything has a meaning.

825
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:32,999
Whatever it does, little fingers, they all have a meaning

826
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,319
and because they get enlightened.

827
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,680
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

828
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:41,288
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

829
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:45,439
Now if you talk to any Muslims,

830
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,038
they will say, “We have never heard of Resurrection day.”

831
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:51,225
Find in the Koran, if you see,

832
00:45:51,426 --> 00:45:53,928
most of it is dealt with the resurrection day,

833
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:57,189
and the doomsday is very little.

834
00:45:57,813 --> 00:45:59,999
But people will talk about the doomsday

835
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,520
because they can frighten others with that

836
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,080
and have their own cults and own things.

837
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,680
But actually the resurrection day is the most important thing.

838
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,145
And for which Mohammed Sahib has clearly said the future.

839
00:46:14,346 --> 00:46:17,320
He didn’t say that, “I’m the last, now nothing is going to happen.”

840
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,960
He said, “At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.”

841
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,960
And that’s exactly what happens,

842
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,359
that you start feeling others on your fingertips.

843
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,404
You know through your fingertips

844
00:46:29,606 --> 00:46:33,320
what centers are catching in another person or in yourself also,

845
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,200
and immediately you start improving it, if you know how to do it.

846
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,480
And that’s what you have to learn: is the divine technique,

847
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:46,276
the true knowledge, of how to handle this power of Divine Love,

848
00:46:46,477 --> 00:46:48,576
that is flowing through you.

849
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:52,799
So this center is very important, I think, for Americans.

850
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:56,839
It has one side by which people are aggressive.

851
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,054
When they talk they’re bumptious, they are ego oriented,

852
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:04,600
they try to suppress others by their speeches

853
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,319
and try to dominate others when they talk

854
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,253
– these are the right sided people.

855
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:12,880
The other side are the left sided people when they feel guilty,

856
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,560
they think they have done this wrong, and that wrong,

857
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,320
they should not have done this wrong.

858
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,360
Actually I’ve seen that in America

859
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,640
most of the people have problems here, most surprising,

860
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,591
They are all the time shaking their neck like this, all the time.

861
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:28,960
In My program also I’ve seen, they have always a problem here.

862
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,480
The thing is that they have a greater responsibility

863
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,383
to keep this center the best,

864
00:47:34,578 --> 00:47:37,348
by keeping the responsibility of spirituality

865
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:40,799
quite the highest priority.

866
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:43,200
They should have the highest priority.

867
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,805
But what you find that all the people are coming

868
00:47:46,006 --> 00:47:48,199
from all over the world to help the Americans.

869
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,765
A day should come when the Americans should go all over the world

870
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:53,160
to give Realization.

871
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,545
And I’m sure that day will come one day

872
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,384
when you will grow up to that sense of responsibility

873
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:01,203
when this center will really stand up,

874
00:48:01,404 --> 00:48:03,802
as a spiritual personality.

875
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,341
Now, the higher center is of Agnya chakra which

876
00:48:08,543 --> 00:48:13,101
he has told you about, is the center when you get Realization,

877
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:15,439
and when the Kundalini rises above that,

878
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,497
you become thoughtlessly aware.

879
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:23,879
Now at this time you get the power first of all of curing people.

880
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,920
If you touch somebody, he’s cured.

881
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,920
If you say something, that happens.

882
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,319
If you go in the house, something good comes in that house.

883
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,757
Auspiciousness starts working through you,

884
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,311
when this center is opened.

885
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,280
But one should not leave at that center,

886
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,503
because if you start moving onto the left, or to the right,

887
00:48:40,704 --> 00:48:42,519
you'll get into problems.

888
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,520
If that center starts moving onto the right,

889
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:48,760
then you start seeing visions, which is a very wrong thing.

890
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:51,078
You go into the realm of supra-conscious

891
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,120
or into the collective supra-conscious,

892
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,760
by you can become a very ego oriented person.

893
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:59,798
You can be a very violent, hot tempered, quarrelsome person.

894
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:02,120
Actually, Hitler used this.

895
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,840
Hitler used this method from the lamas he learnt,

896
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,799
and he put people onto the right side of the supraconscious,

897
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:13,678
into collective supraconscious and put the spirits, dead spirits,

898
00:49:13,879 --> 00:49:19,160
who were of the people who were extremely ambitious and cruel.

899
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,799
That’s how this cruelty came into the Germans

900
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,884
and they forgot what they were.

901
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,560
They forgot they were human beings,

902
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,799
the way they killed, the way they behaved,

903
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:30,480
it’s impossible for any human being to do that.

904
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:32,779
But he managed this, and is written down

905
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,120
that he got all this from lamas from Tibet.

906
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,799
From there he got the knowledge how to put people

907
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:42,439
onto the collective supraconscious.

908
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,920
Now the people who can go to the left side,

909
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,440
also start curing people, they start...

910
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:52,480
In such a company you might just get stunned.

911
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,160
If you face such a person you might just get stunned.

912
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,919
Or you might get a kind of a complete attraction for such a person

913
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,279
You might get completely under the domination of such a person.

914
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,960
You might surrender completely to such a person,

915
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,874
and you will not know what you are doing,

916
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:12,374
till that person has completely destroyed you.

917
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:15,399
This type of people have these horrible powers

918
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,040
because they enter into the collective subconscious.

919
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,582
And when they enter into the collective subconscious,

920
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:24,920
they gather those spirits, which they use.

921
00:50:25,764 --> 00:50:29,799
But the people, who as it is, move to the left side,

922
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:35,160
who cry, weep, emotional, feel guilty all the time

923
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,520
miserable people, they jump onto the left side.

924
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,612
Now all the diseases, practically most of them,

925
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:45,567
like AIDS, like cancer, like myelitis.

926
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:48,560
All these diseases come from the left sided entry

927
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,840
and is accepted by the doctors;

928
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,680
because I’ve seen a very good film made by the doctors,

929
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:55,399
who were researching on cancer,

930
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,480
that when the body is vulnerable to these diseases,

931
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,640
means when you are over-exerting yourself,

932
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,240
when there is too much of sympathetic activity in a person,

933
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,720
and when a person is absolutely fagged out with it,

934
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,061
at that time, they say,

935
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:14,614
that these diseases are triggered into you,

936
00:51:14,757 --> 00:51:16,279
that somebody triggers it.

937
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,090
And what is this they call, is the protein 52, and protein 58,

938
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:23,542
and all these names they give because doctors don’t know

939
00:51:23,743 --> 00:51:25,011
that they are dead spirits.

940
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:27,787
And these are the things when they enter into you

941
00:51:27,988 --> 00:51:29,136
then they trigger it.

942
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:31,134
But they say something very right,

943
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,298
and that is that these things come

944
00:51:33,499 --> 00:51:36,471
from the area built in you since your creation,

945
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:39,291
means your collective subconscious.

946
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:41,720
And that I have been saying for so many years.

947
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,559
Now recently I saw this film.

948
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,560
So they are coming to the same point, but after such a long time,

949
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,480
that it is triggered by them.

950
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,439
So those people who go too much to the left get this trouble.

951
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,359
Those who go too much to the right get heart trouble, heart attacks;

952
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,519
but not the slow attack, because heart has double type of attacks,

953
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,959
it can a be slow heart or it can be a fast heart.

954
00:52:07,229 --> 00:52:09,960
The people who go on the right side have everything fast,

955
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,720
liver is moving fast, everything moving fast,

956
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,968
it’s such a speedy temperament because they are so speedy.

957
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,772
In the morning they’ll get up, “Now I have to go to the office”

958
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:21,231
and they’ll be taking the breakfast in one hand,

959
00:52:21,432 --> 00:52:23,850
putting one foot in the trousers,

960
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:27,280
and another hand into the coat, running to the car,

961
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,200
and there's a big another jam coming up

962
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,798
and then swearing at everything and it’s a mess throughout.

963
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:35,680
And the whole body gets messed up.

964
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,313
And when the whole body gets messed up,

965
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:40,774
then what happens, that your speedometer

966
00:52:40,975 --> 00:52:43,319
which is the spleen also goes out of order

967
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,200
and you develop a funny type of temperament.

968
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,960
If you say them that, “We have to go now to the airport”

969
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,520
you see them absolutely gone as they are wobbly.

970
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,799
The whole machine goes off, you don’t know why,

971
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,169
if you ask them, “What’s the …?” “Oh! I have to go to the airport.”

972
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,440
So what? Even the name of the airport can put people like that.

973
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,120
So they become absolutely uneasy people,

974
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,560
and this kind of thing when happens, you see, you are in for trouble

975
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:10,556
you are very much in for trouble.

976
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:13,181
And this is to be balanced and put right

977
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:15,943
through your Kundalini awakening.

978
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,279
Now this center as you know, is the most important center

979
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:22,999
because this is the gate to the Kingdom of God,

980
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,158
and is governed by our Lord Jesus Christ,

981
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,799
who is the embodiment of innocence.

982
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:33,136
Here He does not incarnate, there He incarnates on this earth.

983
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:37,868
Now, His crucifixion was fixed, and He was to be crucified

984
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:42,853
to show that He is eternal life, which does not die.

985
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:46,279
He is Chaitanya; He is made of all these vibrations.

986
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,680
So He could walk on the water also,

987
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,721
and He could pass through that tight closeness

988
00:53:53,935 --> 00:53:59,199
of these two balloon-like structures, ego and superego,

989
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,160
and could settle there to establish that center for us,

990
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

991
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,319
which controls your ego and superego, both.

992
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,240
But most surprising, the people who are, say, Catholics

993
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,680
are the people who use their superego.

994
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,040
They get conditioned very much, this should not be done,

995
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,760
confessions, weeping, crying, unhappy...

996
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:26,479
"We have to be miserable"… Why?

997
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,439
Christ has been crucified for you. He has suffered for you.

998
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,480
Why? If you have accepted Christ, you should be joyous.

999
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,191
Only to be awakened Christ,

1000
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:38,772
so that you get your Realization, that’s all. What is there to cry?

1001
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:41,799
If they are, say Protestants and all that...

1002
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:43,879
I took My birth in Protestant religion,

1003
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,840
and many Hindus and Muslims ask Me,

1004
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,799
“Mother, why did You take Your birth in Protestant religion?”

1005
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:51,799
So I said, “They are very sophisticated fanatics,

1006
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:53,799
because they rationalize everything.

1007
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,799
They rationalize God, they rationalize every dogma, everything

1008
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:58,799
it’s such a thinking going on there,

1009
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:01,279
So it is very difficult to push them back,

1010
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,679
that God is not thinking, God is beyond thought,

1011
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,360
God is beyond your mind. Mind is limited.

1012
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,004
You have to go beyond that,

1013
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:12,319
and that’s why Christ crossed that limit by His resurrection.

1014
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,991
So His message is His resurrection

1015
00:55:15,165 --> 00:55:19,420
and His resurrection has given us a special quality,

1016
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:21,417
that once He is awakened within us,

1017
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:24,680
the both these ego and superego are sucked in by Him.

1018
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,840
That means He died for our sins,

1019
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,480
so that He sucked our sins, our karmas,

1020
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,895
everything sucked in and this opens out.

1021
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:35,040
Once this opens out, the Kundalini comes out.

1022
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:37,799
And this is what He has done such a great work

1023
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:39,560
that He has died for our sins

1024
00:55:39,747 --> 00:55:42,250
and when He is awakened,

1025
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,934
both these institutions are sucked in,

1026
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,000
and you become

1027
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,960
egoless, superegoless,

1028
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,799
you become de-conditioned automatically.

1029
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,999
Now this great incarnation was called as Mahavishnu

1030
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,799
and is described in the ancient books

1031
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:05,238
about fourteen thousand years back, by Markandeya.

1032
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,799
But people could not relate it to that,

1033
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:09,799
because when Christians went from here,

1034
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,503
they went in a different mode, it was a political stunt.

1035
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:15,798
You see, they carried a gun in one hand and a Bible in another hand.

1036
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:18,913
Such people could not communicate with other people,

1037
00:56:19,115 --> 00:56:20,756
who had everything with them,

1038
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:24,160
and they never read those books to them, it was all prohibited.

1039
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,560
Bible is too small a book to contain a character like Christ.

1040
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,536
He was too great a man,

1041
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:32,798
and we should have gone all out to see

1042
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:35,040
what He’s described in other scriptures,

1043
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,160
how He’s talked about, let us find out.

1044
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,160
We should have been open minded about it.

1045
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,800
Instead of that people just laughed

1046
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,365
and mocked at all these old books, the Scriptures,

1047
00:56:45,566 --> 00:56:47,087
and they thought they are the wisest.

1048
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:50,720
This is the worst part is that the ego thinks they are the highest,

1049
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,920
they are the best, they can do what they like

1050
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,560
and that is how they lived.

1051
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,760
But thank God, now, people are realizing

1052
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:01,319
that we have missed the point, we have definitely missed the point.

1053
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,793
So we have to see what He was

1054
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:06,960
before He came on this earth,

1055
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,799
in the Heaven, how He was created, how He was Alpha and Omega,

1056
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:15,399
what was His own nature, for what purpose He came,

1057
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,560
and why He died, why He was resurrected,

1058
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,039
why this drama was to be carried out?

1059
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,240
For this, only three and a half years of Christ cannot explain,

1060
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,920
and people cannot tell us why all these things happened.

1061
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,799
We have to keep a very open mind about Christ,

1062
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:35,359
and we have to see with our own eyes how it works out.

1063
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,799
In Kundalini awakening you’ll be surprised,

1064
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:39,799
when the Kundalini stops here,

1065
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:41,866
and this chakra is closed,

1066
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:45,999
then you have to say the Lord’s prayer, everywhere,

1067
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,360
whether you are a Jew, you are a Muslim,

1068
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,720
you are a Hindu or a Christian.

1069
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,799
From whatever community you become a yogi,

1070
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:57,359
you become a realized soul, you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

1071
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,111
because the Kundalini won’t rise,

1072
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:03,960
and that is the one of the greatest proof

1073
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,879
that Christ resides here.

1074
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,400
If you do not say the Lord’s Prayer, it doesn’t work out.

1075
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,839
So Lord’s Prayer is a mantra, is a chanting,

1076
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,316
but is to be said by a person who is a realized soul,

1077
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:15,879
who is authorized for you.

1078
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,080
Otherwise it is called as anadhikar cheshta,

1079
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,159
means the person who has no right,

1080
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,920
is trying to do something, is doing a wrong thing.

1081
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,999
So those who are realized souls, when they say

1082
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,799
this mantra, then this center is opened up,

1083
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:32,399
Christ is awakened, and you are allowed

1084
00:58:32,636 --> 00:58:35,581
to see, allow your Kundalini to pass through it

1085
00:58:35,782 --> 00:58:39,799
and enter into the realm of this limbic area

1086
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:46,999
where is one thousand petaled Lotus remains.

1087
00:58:47,494 --> 00:58:50,360
Now these petals then open up,

1088
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,799
because of the pressure being reduced

1089
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:55,669
of the ego and super ego,

1090
00:58:55,870 --> 00:59:00,920
and they are in different beautiful colored flames.

1091
00:59:01,194 --> 00:59:04,880
The outside starts with a just like

1092
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,984
from vibgyor if you take it, from

1093
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,279
Vibgyor in the same way they start, but very slowly moving

1094
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,293
and the end ones are like crystal, crystal,

1095
00:59:15,494 --> 00:59:17,440
absolutely like crystal, they’re shinning.

1096
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,759
And when the Kundalini comes out of it

1097
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:23,520
you see the whole thing opened out, the whole chakra opens out.

1098
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,080
This is a very important center which has to be opened out

1099
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,040
because here all the seven centers are there.

1100
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,869
For example, we have got here at the back,

1101
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,654
if you start here, from here if you start, is the Mooladhara,

1102
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,365
and then around it is the Swadisthana,

1103
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:43,765
and here is the Nabhi, and then it is the Heart.

1104
00:59:43,966 --> 00:59:47,310
See now. This is the hole which has to open,

1105
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:48,856
and this is the Heart,

1106
00:59:49,057 --> 00:59:52,799
means if there is a dirty heart,

1107
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:55,999
if there is a closed heart, if it is a tired heart,

1108
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,718
if there is a sick heart, then this doesn’t open.

1109
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,760
So in the heart resides the Spirit,

1110
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,319
and that’s why this is the seat of the Spirit,

1111
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,080
but it resides in the heart.

1112
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,440
So when this opens out,

1113
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,946
this flower-like lotus opens out,

1114
01:00:15,169 --> 01:00:18,080
then the Kundalini rises in Her own glory,

1115
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,720
and you get your Realization, as you got it.

1116
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,880
Now as I told you, it is the beginning.

1117
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,799
In the Bible it is said,

1118
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,799
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

1119
01:00:29,007 --> 01:00:31,502
and you can see it. I see it every day,

1120
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:33,560
the beautiful tongues of flames.

1121
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,160
But you can’t see it because you are in it.

1122
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,079
Whatever you see, you are not, so you have to first become.

1123
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,880
Once you become and you grow into that,

1124
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,480
then you can also start seeing, but just now you have to become.

1125
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,718
Supposing you see the light, means you are not the light.

1126
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,880
If you see anything, you are not that.

1127
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:57,235
So the question is of becoming, of actualizing and growing into it

1128
01:00:57,436 --> 01:01:00,040
and knowing about everything that you do,

1129
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,120
Everything should be knowledgeable and should be understood,

1130
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,999
should be logical.

1131
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,880
I hope it works out in this place. 
I have told you all about chakras.

1132
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,799
Tomorrow what to do after Self Realization I’ll tell you.

1133
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:16,090
And we'll have another session here in this hall,

1134
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,661
luckily we have got it,

1135
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:20,430
and we have decided to have one more program tomorrow.

1136
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:23,480
I hope it will be nice tomorrow and it won’t rain so much.

1137
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,279
So call all your friends. I will tell you what’s to be done

1138
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,076
after Realization, what is the situation.

1139
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:32,480
So, may God bless you. Thank you.

1140
01:01:36,032 --> 01:01:37,640
SY: Friday night, Shri Mataji.

1141
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:39,792
SM: We have tomorrow.
SY: Friday, Friday.

1142
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:43,944
SM: I'm sorry. I don't know, whatever it is, you tell them.

1143
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:00,720
Like yesterday you have to do. We'll do it again today

1144
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,600
and it will work out I'm sure.

1145
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:08,039
Like yesterday we have to put our hands on our lap just like this,

1146
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,799
in a very comfortable way.

1147
01:02:09,999 --> 01:02:11,959
First of all, we must sit comfortably.

1148
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,799
There should be no discomfort and that is distractive.

1149
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,799
So just seat very comfortable.

1150
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:21,959
And everyone should do it. There is nothing special or anything,

1151
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,524
but you must try to do it and achieve it

1152
01:02:24,651 --> 01:02:26,799
because is not proper not to do it.

1153
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,691
When there is a chance you must do it,

1154
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:31,799
and it won't be good for others also if you don't want to do it.

1155
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:35,879
It's nothing, nothing too much for you to do it, it's very simple.

1156
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,319
So put your left hands towards Me like this

1157
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,839
and the right hand you have to use,

1158
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,592
because the left hand is the power of desire

1159
01:02:43,772 --> 01:02:46,708
and the right hand is the power of action.

1160
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:48,998
And as I told you yesterday,

1161
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:52,840
that in a village of 6000 people I did not do anything like that.

1162
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,360
Just when I stand up they get Realization

1163
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,999
because they are very simple people in a village.

1164
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,031
But here people are quite complicated, they have problems:

1165
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:04,678
self-created, society-generated,

1166
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:07,558
the atmosphere generated, all sorts of things are there.

1167
01:03:07,802 --> 01:03:10,390
Doesn’t matter. So we have to little bit nourish

1168
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,298
our different centers, which is a very easy thing to do,

1169
01:03:14,498 --> 01:03:17,988
and I, as I told you, you try to follow it.

1170
01:03:18,188 --> 01:03:20,864
Now, you have to close your eyes,

1171
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:24,165
and not to open your eyes because of the Agya Chakra.

1172
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,420
That’s very important.

1173
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,274
Because if your eyes are opened

1174
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:30,457
I find it difficult to raise your Kundalini.

1175
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:32,647
You have to keep your eyes completely closed,

1176
01:03:32,847 --> 01:03:34,353
it will help your eyesight also.

1177
01:03:34,553 --> 01:03:36,298
So keep your eyes completely closed.

1178
01:03:36,498 --> 01:03:40,147
You don’t have to open till you are told to open your eyes.

1179
01:03:40,347 --> 01:03:42,976
So you don’t have to worry at all.

1180
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,973
If there is anything tight in your body, somewhere,

1181
01:03:47,173 --> 01:03:49,941
just loosen it a little bit, – will be a good idea,

1182
01:03:50,141 --> 01:03:52,771
so that you don’t feel uncomfortable.

1183
01:03:53,978 --> 01:03:56,827
There’s nothing dangerous happens, never has happened.

1184
01:03:57,272 --> 01:04:00,056
At the most you may feel little hot in the hand,

1185
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:02,461
at the most, doesn’t matter.

1186
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:06,068
So now, please close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

1187
01:04:06,268 --> 01:04:08,980
Put your both the hands on your lap towards Me.

1188
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,310
Strain your fingers, stretching towards Me.

1189
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:16,099
Just put your hands on your lap stretching.

1190
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,409
Now put the right hand...

1191
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:21,449
Left hand has to be fixed as it is, all the time.

1192
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:26,306
Now the left hand is to be stretched towards Me,

1193
01:04:26,506 --> 01:04:28,830
stretched towards Me, not towards your own hands,

1194
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,222
but towards Me, straight.

1195
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:37,705
Now, the right hand has to be lifted and put on your heart.

1196
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:41,454
Just put it on the left side, on your heart.

1197
01:04:43,692 --> 01:04:46,839
At this point, with all sincerity,

1198
01:04:47,442 --> 01:04:52,374
you have to say or ask a question three times:

1199
01:04:52,575 --> 01:04:56,337
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" - with full confidence.

1200
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:59,082
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

1201
01:04:59,283 --> 01:05:01,988
Forget the past. Forget the past!

1202
01:05:02,188 --> 01:05:03,607
Please, forget the past.

1203
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:06,147
Just now we are talking about the present.

1204
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:12,026
So just say: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

1205
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,944
Three times.

1206
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,997
With full confidence, ask the question.

1207
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,723
Now, put this right hand on your stomach,

1208
01:05:42,924 --> 01:05:44,852
on the left-hand side,

1209
01:05:45,053 --> 01:05:49,104
the center of Swadishtana on the left-hand side.

1210
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:55,670
Nabhi Chakra, on the Nabhi chakra on the left-hand side.

1211
01:05:58,185 --> 01:06:01,692
This is the center of the primordial master within you.

1212
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:06,504
And as you are the Spirit, you have to say with full confidence:

1213
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:11,220
“Mother, I am my own master”.

1214
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:15,475
“I am my own guru” - you have to assert it.

1215
01:06:16,684 --> 01:06:18,955
So that if you have been to wrong gurus,

1216
01:06:19,156 --> 01:06:21,353
fake gurus, all kinds of cults,

1217
01:06:21,553 --> 01:06:23,625
it will all disappear.

1218
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:26,114
Please, say ten times:

1219
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:30,956
"Mother, am I my own guide? Am I my own guru?"

1220
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:34,365
"Am I my own master?”

1221
01:06:44,268 --> 01:06:46,782
Don’t feel guilty, please, don’t feel guilty.

1222
01:06:46,982 --> 01:06:49,428
Don’t feel guilty.

1223
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:55,430
Still you are feeling guilty - it’s very wrong.

1224
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:03,491
Candles.

1225
01:07:05,575 --> 01:07:10,203
Now, put this right hand down below on the stomach.

1226
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:14,946
Down below the stomach is the Swadishtana on the left-hand side.

1227
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:21,716
At this point you have to say:

1228
01:07:22,197 --> 01:07:25,988
“Mother, make me the master of the Divine art

1229
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:28,225
or Divine technique”.

1230
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:31,993
“Mother, I want to be the master of Divine technique”.

1231
01:07:32,194 --> 01:07:36,919
This is the center of the mastery of Divine technique.

1232
01:07:41,616 --> 01:07:44,087
Better.

1233
01:08:03,857 --> 01:08:06,750
Please, say this six times.

1234
01:08:11,457 --> 01:08:14,055
It's all right.

1235
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:22,999
Press this hand again onto the heart.

1236
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,312
Now assert here

1237
01:08:27,514 --> 01:08:31,614
[unclear] you have to say it without feeling guilty.

1238
01:08:32,014 --> 01:08:39,009
With full confidence you have to say: “Mother I am the Spirit”.

1239
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:55,572
SY: Vishuddhi.

1240
01:09:32,411 --> 01:09:35,868
SM: Still, the Hamsa is.

1241
01:09:44,009 --> 01:09:48,654
Now, please put this right hand on the neck.

1242
01:09:48,854 --> 01:09:53,488
Please, put your neck straight, don’t push it back too much.

1243
01:09:53,886 --> 01:09:58,384
On the neck, on the left-hand side, near the shoulder,

1244
01:09:58,585 --> 01:10:01,465
just put it there and..

1245
01:10:02,838 --> 01:10:04,967
press it hard.

1246
01:10:06,504 --> 01:10:09,122
At this point

1247
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:12,868
you have to say: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

1248
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:17,433
Please, say it: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

1249
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:22,853
Sixteen times you have to say: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

1250
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,242
Heart.

1251
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,369
It's better.

1252
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:04,226
SY: Yes, it's good.

1253
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:20,680
Now raise this hand higher onto your forehead across,

1254
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,592
on your forehead across.

1255
01:11:22,792 --> 01:11:29,901
At this point you have to say: “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

1256
01:11:31,761 --> 01:11:33,549
SM: Put the light there I think,

1257
01:11:33,724 --> 01:11:37,537
because with this the right Vishuddhi is heated.

1258
01:11:46,778 --> 01:11:49,107
Press it hard.

1259
01:11:58,751 --> 01:12:00,324
Now without feeling guilty,

1260
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:03,268
put your right  hand to the back of your head,

1261
01:12:03,468 --> 01:12:04,654
back of your head,

1262
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:06,274
and try to press it hard,

1263
01:12:06,474 --> 01:12:08,647
back of your head, just above, yes,

1264
01:12:08,854 --> 01:12:11,658
back of your head. Now, try to pull it.

1265
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:14,587
Pull the head,

1266
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,513
and push the head backwards and pull with your hand.

1267
01:12:19,714 --> 01:12:24,814
At this point you have to say without feeling guilty -

1268
01:12:25,014 --> 01:12:27,766
hundred times I say: without feeling guilty -

1269
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:30,489
you have to say:

1270
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:37,139
"Oh Lord, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong".

1271
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:41,571
Again you feel guilty. Don’t feel guilty.

1272
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:44,901
Please, don’t feel guilty.

1273
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:48,108
SM: Better.
SY: Yes, it's passed.

1274
01:12:48,309 --> 01:12:50,620
SM: It's the [unclear]. Still there.

1275
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:05,163
Now, raise your hand on top of your head.

1276
01:13:05,364 --> 01:13:10,022
SM: Just do that slowly. No, with the candle, means.

1277
01:13:11,865 --> 01:13:13,809
Now, press it hard,

1278
01:13:14,024 --> 01:13:16,420
 in the center of it with your palm.
