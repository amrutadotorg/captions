00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.850
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:28.110
It is very important at this time to know
that human beings are not complete, that there

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.090
is something more to be achieved to be complete.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:54.400
Whether you go to the north or south, east
or west, you do not find people joyous.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:10.090
So the conclusion should be that whatever
has been our so-called achievements, has been

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.590
of no avail.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.770
On the contrary, in the modern times, say
about twenty years back we can say, so many

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:40.120
new words have come up, which people like
Me can’t understand.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:49.739
Like tensions, like problems – I don’t
understand.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:04:07.799
But all these have come to us through various
channels and are settled in our conditioning.

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:15.040
While people have talked against conditioning,
that we shouldn’t have condition, we have

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:24.010
conditioned ourselves with all these theories
and talks about something that is unknown.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:46.000
Like psychologists, you have to go to a psychologist
as if everybody

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.229
is an insane person.

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:55.240
Everybody must have a lawyer and must have
a psychologist to hang around.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:06.870
There is no need to have a psychologist for
sane people.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.390
So instead of improving we have gone down.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:22.600
There are certain diseases that have developed
now in America, like AIDS and all that, have

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.980
come to us through our bad conditioning by
Mr.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:38.160
Freud.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:51.660
You cannot analyze a human being by asking
questions, because it’s just a mental process.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.280
Whatever we think and whatever we project
through our mental processes are all artificial,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:09.500
are man-made.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.190
That is how we live in a very relative world,
and we do not know what’s on because we

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.130
are so confused.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.750
You ask anyone, “Did you follow?”

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.230
They say, “I’m confused."

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.790
I mean, in say about thirty years back, nobody
would say like that, nobody was confused this

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.720
way.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:52.699
And to put it upside down they’ll say, “That
means we are aware."

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.470
So the knowledge before you, whatever just
now you have discussed, is the knowledge of

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:05.040
the roots.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:12.120
In this, our modern development, the tree
has grown too big and we have lost all the

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.560
contact with the roots.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:33.150
And to get to the roots is an urge within
us, naturally.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:48.110
That’s how there are seekers, and seekers
of the beyond.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:55.669
Every aware person feels that there’s something
wrong somewhere – that why is it that we

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:09.550
get so confused, because we are not related
to the Absolute.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:21.620
But is there anything that is absolute within
us?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:31.240
That is what we have to see clearly from many
other scriptures and also our scriptures which

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:41.149
are written thousands of years back.

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:51.880
How can you write them off completely/ They
were not liars and they were not confused.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.420
They were very clear cut.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:15.740
And they all talked of the Spirit within us,
of virtue, of righteousness, of peace, of

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.260
bliss.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:35.740
So whatever we have to seek has to be traditionally
built in a spiritual ascent.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:41.820
But those people who live with mental projections
always prefer to have something absurd and

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:52.790
new and sensational as something to truth.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.699
Some sort of an ego-trip.

00:09:54.699 --> 00:10:07.550
Whatever you are seeking has to be based on
the traditional acceptance, and cannot be

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:34.329
something out of the blue, denouncing everything
else which was worked out from ages.

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:42.319
I would say it is the modern ego which refuses
all that is there and wants to accept that

00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:57.350
is something new, may be absolutely stupid.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:06.680
Like in India, we have some very well-educated
brahmins, very mentally equipped, projecting

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:22.680
all the time on mental level.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:29.139
They know Sanskrit, they know what is written
down.

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:37.970
But they asked Me have I heard about something
called dharmopine – all kinds of words.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:50.290
I said, “I never heard these words, from
where do they come into your hand?”

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:56.170
Which saint in India has said that be stricturous,
which scripture in India has said it, which

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.110
Bible has said it or Koran has said it, from
where do they get these words which I’ve

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.110
never heard before?

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.379
They said there is something like Shaktipath.

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:13.200
I said, “Where is this word, show Me."

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:33.630
Now can you imagine, one person called Vishnutirt,
wrote one book, one book sixty years back,

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:42.939
sixty years back, something nonsensical and
they all believed it.

00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:52.589
And all these great people, who are so well-educated,
suffering from high blood pressure, suffering

00:12:52.589 --> 00:13:09.649
from paralysis, heart trouble, cancer, every
sort of disease.

00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:16.879
I said, “At least your guru should look
after your health.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:27.339
By following this special book which you thought
was something great, what has happened to

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:28.339
you?”

00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:29.930
They were quite amazed.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:43.040
I said, “You are all
people who have read Sanskrit, you tell Me

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.410
in any one of the books you have read these
words?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.230
I have not seen anywhere, nor exist.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:14:09.959
Because Shaktipath what you are saying, is
nothing, but you are all possessed."

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:14.749
And after that I think everybody took a note
from there and have been trying all these

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:15.749
tricks.

00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:28.569
And it really entices a modern man to go to
something new like a guru-shopping going on.

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:39.910
Thus these horrible cults have been formed.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:48.560
From 1970, I’ve been talking about it clearly,
these cults are horrifyingly money-making

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.119
processes, and as a result you’ll all get
sick.

00:14:53.119 --> 00:15:05.949
They were all against Me.

00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:17.990
You must know that it has to be based on the
traditionally accepted experience.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:29.329
It cannot be something absurd that people
tell you that you take out your clothes and

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:32.930
start jumping.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:46.879
It was also said in the same book, that people
start jumping like frogs.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:16:01.069
Now just think of it, are we going to become
now frogs or earthworms?

00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:14.040
We have to become superior human beings, we
have to get to the Absolute which is within

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.190
us.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.799
That’s what Christ has said.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:24.049
He said, “You are to be born again,” to
Nicodemus.

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:37.499
And Nicodemus said that “Have I to enter
into the womb of the Mother?”

00:16:37.499 --> 00:16:48.050
But Christ said, “No, you are to be born
of the Holy Ghost.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.170
Whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit."

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.779
Very clearly, very, very clearly.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:57.929
But we forgot.

00:16:57.929 --> 00:17:11.130
And then the religions that
started on these great incarnations of truth

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:25.290
were all false.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:31.330
Like a tree that grows and it starts forming
into sects and sects and sects and ultimately

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:44.970
it goes to nothing, loses all connection with
the main tree.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:59.030
You are to be born again, but it has to be
a living process of the living God.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:06.100
It cannot be something artificial that somebody
puts the hand on your head and says “You

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:16.210
are baptized."

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:24.080
So also same about Islam, what Mohammed said
they did just the opposite, same about Christianity,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:31.400
Hinduism, everything is in juxtaposition.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:48.049
So by changing religion nothing is going to
work out, it’s like changing clothes.

00:18:48.049 --> 00:19:03.860
Or by going to these cults, only you’ll
become a pauper or an insolvent, or might

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.860
become sick.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:16.960
So it is important to understand that whatever
has to happen to us is based on a traditional

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:27.419
ascent.

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:38.240
Our evolutionary process has taken from amoeba
to this stage.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.070
First of all, we should say the carbon.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:48.070
If the carbon had not played its part, there
would have been no amino acids and there would

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:58.269
have been problem creating life.

00:19:58.269 --> 00:20:16.730
So we start from carbon onwards.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:25.850
Carbon is a matter, as you know.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:32.800
Then in evolutionary process you go further
and further that the whole universe was created,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:40.610
and then from amoeba you became a fish, and
from fish you became a tortoise and that is

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:55.970
how evolution took place.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:03.639
All these processes, which took place within
us, are recorded on our central nervous system.

00:21:03.639 --> 00:21:19.220
And they are expressed as centers, subtle
centers of energy within us, which has been

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:24.850
already described to you.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:41.190
But these different centers have been adorned
by a deity, or we can say like a fish which

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.480
came out first.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:50.230
Now the fish was the first leader, and that
is how all these different centers have a

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:55.980
powerful symbolic deity, we can say.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:09.289
Now, when your evolution has to take place,
it has to move through this channel which

00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:14.179
has got these seven centers, carbon being
placed below the Kundalini, which you can

00:22:14.179 --> 00:22:15.179
see in the map.

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:38.450
So, when you move upward the essence of your
being changes, is being evolved and these

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:47.700
are the milestones of your evolution.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:23:01.159
But as you know very well that in this brain
of ours, whatever we know is one thousand

00:23:01.159 --> 00:23:07.480
of what we can know.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:23.740
As described in the Patanjali Yoga there is
a all-pervading Divine Power around us.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:32.049
But you have to feel it, that’s the point
is.

00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:36.720
That you have to feel that power, which you
have not felt so far, though you have seen

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:48.330
it working.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:55.470
We have seen that every flower can become
a fruit and there are billions and billions

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:03.889
they are changing into fruits at different
times of the season.

00:24:03.889 --> 00:24:22.039
This great power we have to feel on our central
nervous system as our ascent is established.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:37.210
That is the
first thing that should happen to us.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:45.370
Now in the Bible the ascent of the disciples
is described very clearly.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:56.149
That when the Holy Ghost blessed them, it
was the breeze, cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:24:56.149 --> 00:25:19.549
Like Adi Shankaracharya has described it as
Salilam, Salilam – means very cool, pleasing.

00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:26.059
So when this cool breeze came in they got
their Realization, they got their second birth

00:25:26.059 --> 00:25:36.090
as a result of that cool breeze.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:48.529
Now then they started using a very strange
language.

00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:55.409
Now this was not that they started speaking
German or English or Indian Sanskrit language,

00:25:55.409 --> 00:26:03.200
it doesn’t mean that.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:12.759
But they started speaking the language of
the centers, the chakras.

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:17.519
There are some Sahaja Yogis here, if you listen
to them, if they have to tell you about you,

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:23.360
what’s wrong with you, they will not say
that you have got cancer or you’ve got diabetes

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.019
or you’ve got madness, they will not say
that.

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:32.429
They will say, this is the center out of gear
or these are the combinations of the centers

00:26:32.429 --> 00:26:33.429
out of gear.

00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:36.030
That is the strange language for a normal
person.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.940
And also because their hands are feeling the
cool breeze, and it’s blowing also the cool

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.940
breeze vibrations, then they try to fulfill
your centers with that power.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:47.750
You might feel that they are moving their
hands in a funny way.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:27:12.030
And some may think they are mad, possibly.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:46.629
If you go in a madhouse, the

00:27:46.629 --> 00:28:03.160
people who are mad think all sane people are
mad.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:11.820
Like our Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru once
went to a mad house and one mad man came and

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:21.460
he asked him, “Who are you?”

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:27.350
So he said, “I am Jawaharlal Nehru."

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.940
So he said, “Oh, you mean the prime minister."

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:36.679
He said, “Yes, same I mean."

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:43.250
He said, “You will be all right, all those
who come here think like that; when they come

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:54.309
here they are all right."

00:28:54.309 --> 00:28:58.940
So this is the situation.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:09.710
When people who are realized souls, who are
one with the Divine, when they behave, it

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:26.799
might look to be little odd to other people,
who are not yet knowing about the Divine Power.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:39.940
But today the situation is very dangerous.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:50.070
Now the problem about Christianity is so dangerous
that they are challenging the sanity of the

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:58.620
disciples of Christ.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:17.139
The theologians, the ones who use their brains
to understand Christ – they follow Paul.

00:30:17.139 --> 00:30:23.549
When I read him, I said, “Who is this one,
this Paul?”

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:30.909
He was the one who tortured the Christians,
he was the one who suffered from epilepsy

00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:36.240
and he is regarded as a great incarnation
in the Bible.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.500
How can he talk about Christ, who is he?

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.549
Kahlil Gibran has written a big chapter about
him: who is this strange man, Mr.

00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:40.549
Paul?

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:41.549
Followed by Augustin.

00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:42.549
Whole thing is nothing but a mental projection.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:43.549
To understand Christ you have to go beyond
your mind.

00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:44.549
To understand anyone of them you have to be
a realized soul, otherwise you cannot understand

00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:45.549
Him.

00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:47.340
Even if you have blind faith, as the Catholics
have, and they don’t want to talk about

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.429
it, because the whole thing was done by Mr.

00:30:49.429 --> 00:30:50.429
Paul himself.

00:30:50.429 --> 00:30:51.610
And they are challenging now the disciples,
who were the realized souls.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.769
I meet many intellectuals, they think that
Paul was correct and that these disciples

00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:53.769
of Christ were not intelligent intellectuals.

00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:55.071
How much Christ knew about intellectuals?

00:30:55.071 --> 00:30:56.071
How much books did He read, to what university
did He go?

00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:57.071
How much education one needs to know God?

00:30:57.071 --> 00:30:59.240
This is how they have shattered so many faithfuls.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240
This is blasphemous.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240
They must first of all get their Realization,
and then they will know what Christ is.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.240
And what His disciples were.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240
This is an aggression, I feel, of the intellectuals
on the faithfuls, a new type of crucifixion.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240
In India none of the saints were educated
in any university, nor Rama or Krishna went

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240
to any university as such.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.240
And we can understand this better, because
we have tradition of understanding an incarnation

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240
in our country.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.240
And then they make a picture about Maria and
all these people, insulting Her chastity.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.240
And they bring Mozart, who was a realized
soul, into such a shameful shape.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240
It is an attack, it is an attack, I again
tell you, it’s a hitlerish – worse than

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.860
that an attack on all that is sublime, all
that is divine, all that is pure.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:19.850
But the time is different, they don’t know,
they cannot go very far with that.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:24.870
Now you people, who are seekers, must realize
the importance of this time because this is

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.020
the time we are on the verge of ascending
or absolutely getting destroyed.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.889
You have to stand by it and see for yourself
that you get your Self Realization.

00:31:32.889 --> 00:31:37.409
That you know your Self, and you go beyond
this mental projection and this ego and achieve

00:31:37.409 --> 00:31:39.390
that absolute, that eternal life for yourself.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.980
Of course, you cannot pay for it, it’s absurd.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.970
It has to work out.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:49.679
But Realization doesn’t mean that you first
feel it and it’s permanent, because we are

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:50.679
very complicated people.

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:55.210
In the foothill of Himalayas went recently
and there were three thousand people walking

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.759
twenty miles distance came to program.

00:31:56.759 --> 00:31:57.759
Three thousand people.

00:31:57.759 --> 00:32:00.110
Everyone got Realization, and they are there,
no more lost.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:06.590
They know about the Kundalini, the Goddess
and the advertisement was: “There will be

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.230
awakening of the Goddess."

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.230
That’s all.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.700
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:17.280
And thousands of years back a great astrologer
called Brighu Muni, who is the actually the

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:24.879
first pioneer of astrology in India, has written
of these days when the Kundalini will be awakened

00:32:24.879 --> 00:32:25.879
spontaneously, sahaj.

00:32:25.879 --> 00:32:39.129
In these modern times, in this Kaliyuga, it
is going to happen, and they were just waiting.

00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:42.120
You cannot intellectualize the Divine.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:53.179
You have to experience it on your central
nervous system.

00:32:53.179 --> 00:33:03.499
As a result of this ascent, the word “problem”
will go away, the word “tension” will

00:33:03.499 --> 00:33:04.499
go away.

00:33:04.499 --> 00:33:08.940
The sickness will go away.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.110
You won’t need psychologists and lawyers.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:17.110
You’ll enter into the Kingdom of God, where
you will be looked after.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:25.009
Tomorrow I hope to tell you one by one what
are the manifestations of Self and what one

00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:27.660
can achieve through Self Realization.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:35.039
But today we should go in for the experience
of the Spirit which takes hardly any time.

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:38.970
And then we’ll have it tomorrow in a proper
way.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:46.710
Now as it is, I don’t know, if you would
like to ask some questions to Me, because

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:47.710
we shouldn’t waste too much time on questioning.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.919
It doesn’t help much, because question is
again a mental project.

00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:59.380
But if you want to ask Me questions, you can
write them down and I’ll try to answer them

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.380
tomorrow.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:06.159
Will be better idea than to divert the attention
of people.

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:10.450
You better tell your mind to keep quiet for
a while, because questioning is such a common

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:11.730
thing with us.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:16.020
So tell your mind, “Just keep quiet for
a while."

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.060
Gregoire announces in German language the
Self Realization experience.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.429
Shri Mataji: Already they are in thoughtless
condition.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:24.570
Gregoire explains more.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:30.710
Shri Mataji: You see, it is meant for really
serious people, not for people who just come

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:36.380
for lectures and things, it’s meant for
people who are real seekers and who are truthful,

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.900
otherwise it doesn’t work out.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.900
I am sorry.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.900
Gregoire explains more.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:45.990
Shri Mataji: To take the advantage of the
Mother Earth you have to take out the shoes.

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:47.399
Gregoire explains more.

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:50.669
Shri Mataji: Open there if it’s tight.

00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:53.950
Gregoire explains more about Self Realization
exercise.

00:34:53.950 --> 00:35:01.100
Shri Mataji: Moreover, I think there is one
question in the minds of people that is there

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:10.310
any condition on all that, there’s no condition
at all.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:16.350
Your Kundalini will rise automatically and
then, when you become the Spirit, you become

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:17.790
your own master.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.150
And your Spirit guides you through vibrations.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.060
There is no condition of any kind.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.290
It’s already done.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:32.250
Now you have to put your hands towards Me
because all these five fingers, six and seven

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.960
are the centers on the left hand side and
one on the right hand side the sympathetic

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.350
nervous system, which join together and become
the centers of the parasympathetic.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:47.230
So you have to put your hands just like this
to begin with, just like this and you have

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.120
to close your eyes throughout the experience
– so you can take out your spectacles, because

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.120
your eyesight also improves with that.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.570
You should not overlap your feet, but if you
are sitting – squatting is all right.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:36:01.210
But if you are not squatting then you should
keep your legs little parallel and both the

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:06.190
hands on your lap, on the knees like this.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:17.230
And then we will be using the left hand for
the desire, because this is the power of desire,

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:28.100
which you put towards Me and the power of
action through your hand we have to work out.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:40.080
So I have to tell you about these centers
that we are going to ourselves open out with

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.970
the Kundalini’s awakening.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:48.910
The left hand will be throughout like this,
with the right hand we will be putting it

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.170
first to the heart, where resides the Spirit.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.040
Right hand, right hand.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.240
I will tell you when we close the eyes.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.440
But I’m just now telling you so you understand.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:08.140
Now in the upper part of your stomach on the
left hand side – we are working on the left

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:17.260
hand side the whole thing is – so on the
upper part of your stomach.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.780
Now in the lower part of your stomach.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:29.950
Then you have to go upward again – upper
part of the stomach on the left hand side,

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:37.570
then on the heart, then on this side from
the front, many people try from that side

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.740
– this side.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.330
In this area where the neck and the shoulder
makes an angle and then in front here.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:44.330
And then at the back.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:48.960
And then you have to stretch your palm and
put this part of your hand here on the fontanel

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.850
bone area, which is the soft bone when you
are a child, and press it.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:52.850
Move it clockwise, seven times.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.760
To stretch it so that this thing touches here.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.810
Now the first experience you have is that
you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.540
Ghost coming out of your head.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.770
Holy Ghost is the Kundalini.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.710
So that is our first time you get your baptism
in the real sense of the word.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:13.780
Then your fingertips are enlightened, you
can feel the all-pervading Power of God that

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:18.100
starts flowing through you, and tomorrow I’ll
tell you how to use It.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.050
You do feel very blissful, joyous and sometimes
you feel you have achieved everything.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:27.430
But I have to tell you that establishment
of this second birth has to be done properly

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.610
through group practice of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.970
And luckily you have very good Sahaja Yogis
here and a very good center for you.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:44.020
For which you don’t have to pay anything,
but little time is to be spared to go and

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:51.650
see those people or they might have a follow-on
program for you, which you must attend.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:56.050
And the Sahaja Yogis are the people who have
established it.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:02.670
In the same way you can establish it and they
can give you Realization.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:07.210
In the same way you can give Realization,
too.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:13.430
And tomorrow I’ll tell you all other things
you can do.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:14.560
All right.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.510
So today, be in a pleasant mood.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.780
In a pleasant mood.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.910
All right?

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.710
And not to feel guilty about anything.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.260
That is the most important thing.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:33.730
You are the temple of God, only the light
has to come.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.280
There is nothing to feel guilty.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:45.380
That is the biggest hurdle I feel in the West
that people feel guilty for nothing at all,

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.350
for all useless things.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:52.760
If they wear a black shoe with a white sari
they feel guilty.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.700
Any little thing, they feel guilty.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:01.480
You are supposed to be free people why should
you feel guilty about anyone?

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:07.640
Even your forefathers and great grand parents
– there is no need to feel guilty for anyone.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:13.430
In short, you must forgive yourself and you
must respect yourself.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:18.630
There’s nobody like a sinner in My eye.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:22.380
I don’t see anybody as a sinner.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:26.360
Christ has died for us, for our sins.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:31.330
Now why should we think we are sinners any
more?

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.310
Only we have to awaken Christ within us.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.310
That’s all.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:37.310
All right.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:44.920
So, please have your left hand towards Me
and close your eyes.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.770
Put your right hand on your heart.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:59.210
I think, you should put it inside the coat,
would be better, inside.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:04.350
Now, in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.050
It’s the Absolute.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.890
But it is not in our attention.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:14.130
So, you have to ask Me a very fundamental
question.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:21.930
You can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whichever
suits you.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:27.840
The question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.060
Ask this question three times.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:43.780
You are not to open your eyes till I tell
you to open, please.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:50.280
Because attention goes out through our eyes,
keep it closed.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:42:00.040
Now this question follows another question,
that if you are your Spirit you become your

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:05.900
own master, your own guide, your own guru,
guide.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:17.910
So you put your right hand down below on the
upper part of your stomach which is the center

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:29.680
of the guru principle, the master principle,
which is built by many great prophets.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:35.560
Now, here you please ask Me another question
three times, “Mother, am I my own master?

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.770
Mother, am I my own guide?

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:39.970
Mother, am I my own guru?”

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.070
Ask three times.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:45.820
Now please take your hand, right hand on the
lower part of your abdomen and press it.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.060
Now, keep the left hand towards Me throughout.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:56.350
This is a center which works out the Divine
Laws, the Divine Technique and which is to

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:06.580
be respected because through this only the
Kundalini would rise, awaken.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.930
So you have to have the true knowledge.

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.370
Knowledge doesn’t mean through your brain,
but through your central nervous system.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:18.170
So here you have to say something, because
I cannot cross your freedom.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.890
It’s your freedom that you have to ask yourself.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:26.400
I cannot force you for the awakening of the
Kundalini.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:32.420
So here six times, because this center has
got six petals, you have to say that you want

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.780
to have the true knowledge.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:38.760
So you have to say, “Mother, please, may
I have the true knowledge?”

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.150
Six times, please.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:53.250
Now again move your right hand in the upper
part of your abdomen, where the guru principle

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.730
center is there.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:44:00.481
Here now, to make the awakened Kundalini move
through this center you have to assert that

00:44:00.481 --> 00:44:02.530
you are the master, accepting that.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:08.340
Ten times you have to say, “Mother, I am
the master.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.250
Mother, I am the guide.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.990
Mother, I am my own guru."

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:21.960
You have to assert, with full confidence in
yourself.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.950
Aside: Hot, very hot.

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:38.990
All right, now, please say it ten times with
full confidence in yourself.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:49.580
Now please raise your right hand to your heart
again.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.980
Here there are twelve petals.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:45:03.710
So you have to say again with full confidence,
“Mother, I am the Spirit, I am the Spirit,

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.590
I am the Spirit."

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:06.590
Kundalini is rising.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:17.660
Now you have to know that the Divine is the
ocean of love, grace and compassion.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:23.000
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:38.940
So whatever so called guilt you have please
know that in that ocean everything gets dissolved

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.050
in no time.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:51.040
Because you are the Spirit and the Spirit
cannot be guilty.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:57.060
So now raise you right hand in the corner
between the neck and the shoulder, take it

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.290
little backwards and hold it tight.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.530
This is the worst center everyone has.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:05.380
This you develop through feeling guilty.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.300
Put your right hand there, not the left hand.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.810
Left hand should be towards Me.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:15.930
In this center you have to say sixteen times,
“Mother, I am not guilty at all."

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.320
This kind of guilt gives you all kinds of
diseases, like angina, like spondylitis, all

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.650
kinds of diseases.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:29.770
Now sixteen times, from your heart, please
say, “Mother, I am not guilty."

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:38.050
From your heart, believing in yourself, “I
am not guilty at all."

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:53.130
Even if you have been smoking or drinking
or doing anything, just say that – not to

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.670
feel guilty.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:47:07.570
Because this is the decision of the Divine.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:11.270
Now if you still feel guilty better punish
yourself by saying it 108 times.

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.230
Better tell them – they can’t forgive
themselves.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.630
If they can’t forgive themselves.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.630
Now better?

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:16.630
It’s better.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:30.910
Now please put your right hand on your forehead
across and press it on both the sides as we

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:36.760
press them when we have headaches.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:56.900
Now here – not many times, but from the
deep feeling from the heart you have to say,

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:05.620
“Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:23.280
Many say that
it is difficult to say this, but it’s a

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.280
myth.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.422
If you forgive or don’t forgive there isn’t
anything that you do.

00:48:27.422 --> 00:48:39.400
But if you don’t forgive then you play into
the hands of wrong people.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:51.920
From your heart you have to say it, once for
all, “I forgive everyone, Mother."

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.160
Aside: Feel all the blisters.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.470
All right.

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:27.180
Now at the back, you have to put your hand
at the back of your head.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.070
This is very important to press for your eyesight
specially.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:37.890
Now without feeling guilty again, because
this you have to say, because still you feel

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:38.890
guilty.

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:45.590
That’s why I just want you to say without
feeling guilty.

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:53.720
Here you have to say that “If we have done
anything wrong against the Divine, please

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.720
forgive."

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.720
That’s all.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:03.810
Ask for forgiveness from God or from Divine
or whatever you want to feel that.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:13.650
But don’t count your sins, don’t think
of them, just say it in a general way – and

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.650
don’t feel guilty.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.650
Now good.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:16.970
These are the mantras on these centers

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:20.510
Now raise your hand on top of your head.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:32.890
Press it on the fontanel bone area which was
a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.800
Now press it and move it clockwise.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.340
Bend our head a little.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.950
Seven times.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:56.450
Shri Mataji blows into microphone.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:24.090
Now bring this

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:28.770
hand specially, slowly onto your lap.

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:33.100
Please open your eyes slowly.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:57.330
Now there is no thought if you see within
yourself so you can watch Me without thinking.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.870
Don’t think.

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:20.790
Now put your left hand
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:39.690
out of

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:54.140
your head.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:53:08.750
You can bend your head and see.

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.950
Sometimes it can be hot coming out.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:58.890
Now put the right hand and see if there’s
a cool breeze.

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:07.590
See now, just put the hand like this.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:21.760
Feeling the cool breeze?

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:29.600
You have to certify yourself.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.370
Good.

00:54:31.370 --> 00:55:00.260
Now you may put up your hands to
the sky.

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:12.500
Push back your head and say, “Is this the
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.830
Ask the question three times.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:17.830
Good.

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:22.290
Now put it down.

00:55:22.290 --> 00:56:06.170
Now see, are

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:14.910
you feeling anything.

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:51.340
Those who are feeling the cool breeze in

00:56:51.340 --> 00:57:15.260
their head or in their hands please raise
your hands.

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:24.120
Look at that.

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:35.930
May God bless you!

00:57:35.930 --> 00:58:12.140
I bow to
you all.

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:42.460
You are great.

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:53.310
Please come back tomorrow and try to establish
it.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:59:13.060
So many of
you have got it.

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:22.590
Now this silence you’ll enjoy.

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:35.880
Don’t think about it.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:54.150
Don’t think.

00:59:54.150 --> 01:00:46.980
Just go, don’t talk too much.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:01:23.820
Enjoy your Spirit.

01:01:23.820 --> 01:03:50.270
You have found it.

01:03:50.270 --> 01:14:44.750
Be quiet and just enjoy yourself.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:27:18.100
Just enjoy.
