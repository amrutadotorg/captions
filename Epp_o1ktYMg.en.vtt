00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Diwali Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 9 November 2003

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.120
Today is the great day of Diwali.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.760
That means today is the great day .....(?)

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.680
lights of your heart together

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.760
to make a greater light

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.320
for the world to move in a proper direction.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.320
It's a day of great joy, and those who join in this,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.120
are spreading also great joy.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.160
But the problems are there, as they say,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.480
but for us there is no problem because there is no darkness,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.560
we don't see any darkness anywhere,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.760
we see lights, and lights, and lights.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:11.440
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.840
We have to be very sincere with ourselves,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.440
because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.960
but it is from within the source,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
it's flowing, flowing and flowing.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.360
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.040
and our small petty things like jealousies

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.960
and competitions and all those things which spoil us

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.720
must be washed away.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.600
And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.240
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.280
so that everybody feels enlightened and happy

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.520
and forgets these petty problems.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.360
I am happy that you have been able to get some hall,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.280
it's all luck that we got it,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.040
people were so much worried about getting a hall.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.000
But it has just happened,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.280
so you should know also that our destiny is all also

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.760
guided and looked after.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400
You are already blessed people,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.800
there is no doubt about it.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.280
And we should not worry about small things and small matters.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.240
It will all work out very well, you will see,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.800
if you just leave it to your destiny, which is very high,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.240
very great - in this your own destiny you will go very far.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400
This is the promise of Diwali

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.600
to you all, that you will reach highest

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.480
and the noblest way of life.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.720
Every word I say will be there

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.240
to prove what I say is there.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.520
Whatever petty problems you have,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.720
they'll all be washed off.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.240
All these are the messages from the Divine,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.640
you don't have to worry about petty things,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.200
about money, about jobs, that's not your job.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.880
Your destiny will work it out.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.520
You have a promise that you'll be looked after.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.840
I hope you believe in that promise

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.600
and are joyous in the highest way.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.720
I bless you all from my heart, all of you,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.880
for a very happy and prosperous Diwali.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.920
Thank you very much.
