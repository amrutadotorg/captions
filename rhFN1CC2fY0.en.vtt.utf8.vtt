01:26.619 --> 01:32.840
unfortunately or fortunately you are

01:29.420 --> 01:35.240
born in these modern times and in these

01:32.840 --> 01:38.330
modern times as you know it's a very

01:35.240 --> 01:41.060
chaotic condition in these chaotic

01:38.330 --> 01:43.640
conditions you don't know what is right

01:41.060 --> 01:50.119
and what is wrong and there are all

01:43.640 --> 01:53.780
kinds of attractions which can take of

01:50.119 --> 01:56.679
your attention and reduce the energy of

01:53.780 --> 01:56.679
your attention

01:57.640 --> 02:07.250
it is possible more for the people who

02:02.659 --> 02:10.250
are very right-sided also the left-sided

02:07.250 --> 02:12.980
people can be very much affected the

02:10.250 --> 02:15.640
right-sided people as you know go up to

02:12.980 --> 02:20.120
a point and become extremely dry

02:15.640 --> 02:24.110
self-opinionated and address all their

02:20.120 --> 02:26.590
attention is in aggression while the

02:24.110 --> 02:37.670
people who are on the left side are

02:26.590 --> 02:41.930
indulging too much into their own both

02:37.670 --> 02:45.470
sides can tear away your attention which

02:41.930 --> 02:49.070
is the most important it is the most

02:45.470 --> 02:52.400
valuable thing is your attention but the

02:49.070 --> 02:58.070
attention cannot be controlled by a

02:52.400 --> 02:59.859
person who doesn't have a weak mind or a

02:58.070 --> 03:03.290
weak heart

02:59.859 --> 03:06.260
in every field of life where there it is

03:03.290 --> 03:09.980
political economic or any field of life

03:06.260 --> 03:14.930
in which human beings are living there

03:09.980 --> 03:20.329
is a very subtle problem which people

03:14.930 --> 03:23.959
don't understand now if I say that there

03:20.329 --> 03:24.880
is spirit within us which shines in our

03:23.959 --> 03:28.900
heart

03:24.880 --> 03:34.860
you need not believe need not

03:28.900 --> 03:38.799
but our attention is not on the spirit

03:34.860 --> 03:44.019
they call it at Mojave mook our

03:38.799 --> 03:47.200
attention is outside at this stage at

03:44.019 --> 03:52.180
the human awareness our attention is

03:47.200 --> 03:56.519
outside outside in various things now

03:52.180 --> 04:02.650
where should our attention go to evolve

03:56.519 --> 04:08.489
for what to achieve what the firstly our

04:02.650 --> 04:08.489
attention has now go towards our spirit

04:08.609 --> 04:17.739
towards spiritual understanding so what

04:16.840 --> 04:20.530
have you

04:17.739 --> 04:21.150
first of all by God's grace as I told

04:20.530 --> 04:24.039
you

04:21.150 --> 04:28.150
you all are realized people so your

04:24.039 --> 04:31.060
ascent is made in the center which is a

04:28.150 --> 04:35.560
very very difficult thing absolutely

04:31.060 --> 04:39.639
difficult notice but you should learn to

04:35.560 --> 04:42.310
keep in the center but how to keep the

04:39.639 --> 04:46.380
attention is in the center is the

04:42.310 --> 04:50.280
problem for many people who are still

04:46.380 --> 04:50.280
not above themselves

04:53.620 --> 05:03.820
now when you meditate try to meditate in

05:02.320 --> 05:07.650
a sustained way

05:03.820 --> 05:12.910
first of all sustained then you find

05:07.650 --> 05:19.290
that you are getting into the state of

05:12.910 --> 05:22.480
Samadhi means at a state where you start

05:19.290 --> 05:25.930
feeling the joy and the Bliss of God's

05:22.480 --> 05:30.340
blessings and then you start saying for

05:25.930 --> 05:34.810
God what a blessing what a blessing and

05:30.340 --> 05:45.360
what a bliss once you have reached a

05:34.810 --> 05:45.360
state then you have to realize Who am I

05:46.350 --> 06:04.770
who are what are you are the spent after

05:59.670 --> 06:09.780
establishing your sustained attention on

06:04.770 --> 06:12.980
the spirit you will develop a state

06:09.780 --> 06:17.870
where you will be in a complete state of

06:12.980 --> 06:17.870
witnessing with joy

06:17.900 --> 06:39.970
[Music]

06:43.290 --> 06:50.820
you say something about maintaining our

06:46.810 --> 06:50.820
attention to that stage that it should

06:56.170 --> 06:59.750
customers asked a very practical

06:57.950 --> 07:04.070
question is true that to keep the

06:59.750 --> 07:07.580
attention where it should be you see for

07:04.070 --> 07:12.940
everything you have to do some exercise

07:07.580 --> 07:12.940
a bath not before realization after them

07:13.480 --> 07:20.750
the best way is to learn how to watch

07:16.490 --> 07:22.850
yourself just start sitting here just

07:20.750 --> 07:27.460
put yourself into a position for where

07:22.850 --> 07:27.460
you watch yourself now what am i doing

07:31.410 --> 07:37.080
this is the bass this is the study apart

07:34.260 --> 07:39.900
from mantras apart from anything the

07:37.080 --> 07:46.500
abuse is the practice practice of

07:39.900 --> 07:48.720
becoming a witness and the witness is

07:46.500 --> 07:50.490
the spirit state their attention will

07:48.720 --> 07:55.080
not go i mean you will see everything is

07:50.490 --> 07:57.990
that attention will be inside try to

07:55.080 --> 08:00.750
practice this a my business now say some

07:57.990 --> 08:03.480
people say oh I had a horrible time

08:00.750 --> 08:06.090
whether this happened that happened see

08:03.480 --> 08:08.510
you are not a witness how can you have a

08:06.090 --> 08:10.980
horrible time if you are the spirit you

08:08.510 --> 08:13.590
only have a horrible time when you are

08:10.980 --> 08:16.050
not the spirit if you can wash the whole

08:13.590 --> 08:18.180
thing as a drama that is played then you

08:16.050 --> 08:20.040
are not having a horrible time but this

08:18.180 --> 08:25.790
outside of you is having horrible time

08:20.040 --> 08:29.940
with your watch that's how the attention

08:25.790 --> 08:33.570
can be fixed very well if you practice

08:29.940 --> 08:35.969
of the Asura practice all the time to be

08:33.570 --> 08:40.680
witness say you go up out you see

08:35.969 --> 08:44.039
something just try see it not to think

08:40.680 --> 08:47.070
about it be a witness of the world the

08:44.039 --> 08:49.590
joy will be complete and also you will

08:47.070 --> 08:51.300
become absolutely peaceful your

08:49.590 --> 08:54.270
attention will be completely enlightened

08:51.300 --> 08:57.290
and then the inspiration you will get me

08:54.270 --> 08:57.290
the tremendous

09:02.110 --> 09:16.029
oh we test is very different from paying

09:13.630 --> 09:19.570
attention paying attention is a

09:16.029 --> 09:23.230
deliberate thing you deliberately pay

09:19.570 --> 09:25.360
attention see to something as I'm

09:23.230 --> 09:27.100
talking you may not be realized you may

09:25.360 --> 09:32.800
be realized you can pay attention to me

09:27.100 --> 09:35.829
but witnessing is a state say I'll

09:32.800 --> 09:37.720
submit myself what happens if there's a

09:35.829 --> 09:40.390
problem or there's some calamity

09:37.720 --> 09:41.800
something suddenly I find and we're

09:40.390 --> 09:48.269
testing the whole thing like a drama

09:41.800 --> 09:48.269
it's a state but you can develop it
