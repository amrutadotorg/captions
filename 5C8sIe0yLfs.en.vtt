00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:11.444
Today we are here to celebrate Mahashivaratri.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:15.605
It’s a very great privilege for all of us

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:19.040
to understand about

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:28.363
Shri Mahadeva.

00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:39.686
Unless and until you have got your Self Realisation

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:44.202
you cannot understand what

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:55.363
is the great personality,

00:00:55.847 --> 00:01:09.645
the character and the powers of Shri Mahadeva.

00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:19.686
It is not easy to conceive,

00:01:20.323 --> 00:01:24.242
also to reach the depths

00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:29.645
of his greatness,

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:34.565
unless and until we are humble.

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:41.847
We have to be very humble to reach

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.040
at the Lotus Feet of Shri Mahadeva.

00:01:55.202 --> 00:02:05.444
As you have seen, one has to cross even the Sahasrara

00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:13.686
to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:25.847
He is beyond – beyond all our conceptions.

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:31.686
But he resides in our hearts as the Spirit,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.242
and is reflected very well when you get your Realisation.¶

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:49.524
But still, one has to understand the powers of Shri Mahadeva

00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:57.928
which is not very easy to describe about

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.928
this great God in liuttle words.

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:12.968
But the first power he himself has,

00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:17.524
that he is a very forgiving God.

00:03:18.524 --> 00:03:21.121
He forgives!

00:03:21.928 --> 00:03:28.282
He forgives us so many of our sins,

00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:34.202
so many of our destructive activities,

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:37.968
our horrible minds

00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:42.968
which tries to create problems for everyone.

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.323
Up to a point!

00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:54.282
But he has the greatest power to destroy.

00:03:54.847 --> 00:04:00.202
His destruction comes so suddenly

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:05.565
because he rules all the elements.

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:11.242
All the elements he rules. He rules the Mother Earth,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:16.403
and he rules all other elements.

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:20.121
Through their causal he rules,

00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:25.081
and he can destroy everything that he wants to

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:29.807
if he finds there is problem.¶

00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:37.726
I have to tell you

00:04:37.847 --> 00:04:42.161
that earthquakes are managed by him, not by me.

00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:46.202
I am not there for destruction.

00:04:46.323 --> 00:04:52.323
He is the one who sees what’s happening on this earth,

00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:56.242
what’s happening to the human beings.

00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:01.161
I’ll give you an example of Gujurat:

00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:07.807
apart from anything, Gujurat people are very money-oriented,

00:05:07.928 --> 00:05:10.363
they are worried with the stock-exchange, this, that,

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:14.444
all the time money, money, money, money, money.

00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:20.766
Even if they are abroad, they are extremely money-oriented.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.242
Sometimes I am surprised,

00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:30.726
impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:37.444
and they like artificial type of things like some gurus or somebody.¶

00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:42.887
I don’t know from where they get like this.

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:51.363
Whatever it is, you have a state called Bhavnagar in Gujurat.

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:54.040
Bhavnagar people came,

00:05:54.161 --> 00:06:00.484
they brought for me those silver slippers, padukas,

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:06.807
to be vibrated; I was surprised, I was happy at least,

00:06:06.928 --> 00:06:09.928
that these people are thinking about it.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.928
So they did a Puja, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.161
and also in Baroda.

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:22.645
These are the two places that were not touched,

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:28.726
even touched even by bookambh by the earthquake.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.726
Can you imagine.

00:06:30.847 --> 00:06:39.686
And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered.

00:06:41.403 --> 00:06:44.686
There are Sahaja Yogis, very few,

00:06:44.807 --> 00:06:51.524
all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.444
This is between the protection of your Mother

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:03.605
and the wrath of God Almighty.¶

00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:08.807
One has to understand this very well,

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:14.766
that he has powers over all the elements.

00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:18.040
I went to France,

00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:22.524
and there some people in France tried to trouble Me.

00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:26.040
And all the media got after Me.

00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:28.968
And on the television, everywhere,

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:32.403
they were saying all kinds of things against me.

00:07:32.524 --> 00:07:36.000
I knew something would go somewhere

00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:40.807
and suddenly from the sea a big –

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:46.161
I don’t know what to call it – a big storm started,

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:49.161
suddenly, no-one knows why.

00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:54.323
And two ships were completely sunk,

00:07:55.121 --> 00:08:01.040
and those people who went to rescue them got cancer.

00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:07.323
Then it came, this storm started moving fast

00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:15.645
and all the churches lost their top – heads I should say.

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:23.323
All the churches lost it. So many priest’s houses were ruined

00:08:23.444 --> 00:08:28.968
and it travelled and came up to the place where I had purchased

00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:32.202
a very big castle.

00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:37.928
It just stopped – and just stopped at the brink of it.

00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:42.242
Now, it is not my doing, I must tell you.

00:08:42.363 --> 00:08:45.968
But this is what he does.

00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:51.686
Though he is very forgiving, he is extremely kind,

00:08:51.807 --> 00:09:00.766
he’s blissful, but you should be aware of his powers.¶

00:09:00.887 --> 00:09:10.363
All those powers are used to protect my work, I should say.

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:17.645
It goes too far and it is to show to people that

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:23.242
they shouldn’t obstruct the work of spirituality.

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:29.766
It should be real spirituality. It should not be somebody

00:09:29.887 --> 00:09:36.484
like a false guru coming up and showing some magic,

00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:43.000
or talking something about some far-fetched thing.

00:09:43.121 --> 00:09:47.363
But the real spirituality, if you have,

00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:50.686
the protection will be always there,

00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:54.242
and Shiva will be very blissful.

00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:57.605
It’s extremely blissful.

00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:03.645
And what does he give you is even more beautiful

00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:05.928
than you could think of.

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:11.565
He is extremely forgiving.

00:10:11.686 --> 00:10:15.403
I should say he is the source of such forgiveness.

00:10:15.524 --> 00:10:22.202
If you have forgiveness in your heart, he resides in your heart.¶

00:10:22.323 --> 00:10:32.524
Otherwise, gradually, you start developing

00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:38.807
very difficult types of diseases.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.363
Say, if you are forgiving, your heart runs very fast.

00:10:47.484 --> 00:10:54.161
No-one can touch your heart. You cannot get heart-attacks.

00:10:54.726 --> 00:11:02.242
But if you are tolerating, suffering

00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:12.242
and taking many things as a power of your own,

00:11:12.363 --> 00:11:18.847
doing wrong things and forgetting about God,

00:11:18.968 --> 00:11:26.121
then you also start developing a very weak heart.

00:11:26.403 --> 00:11:30.363
So one side is that you develop a heart

00:11:30.484 --> 00:11:36.363
which is extremely aggressive,

00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:41.968
and can become like Hitler’s heart.

00:11:42.887 --> 00:11:50.121
Under any kind of pretensions, if you start torturing someone,

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:53.847
your heart becomes solid

00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:58.363
and then you can get a tremendous massive heart-attack,

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.524
and all the troubles from that.

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:06.524
This is inevitable.

00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:12.444
But supposing you are extremely tolerant

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:17.444
and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile,

00:12:17.565 --> 00:12:20.807
you are a frightened person.

00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:25.565
If you are frightened, then because of fright you do that,

00:12:25.686 --> 00:12:30.847
you can develop another kind of a heart we call as angina

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:33.403
where the blood supply is less,

00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:39.403
and ultimately you develop a kind of guilt and

00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:44.484
you lead a very mediocre life.¶

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:51.605
So this second thing also is very visible

00:12:51.726 --> 00:12:57.000
among people who think they are very, very tolerant.

00:12:57.121 --> 00:13:01.766
I am saying that tolerance is alright,

00:13:01.887 --> 00:13:04.484
because of Spirituality,

00:13:04.605 --> 00:13:08.040
but not because you are frightened,

00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:12.686
and you are afraid of something.

00:13:12.807 --> 00:13:16.161
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have no business to be

00:13:16.282 --> 00:13:18.726
afraid of anything.

00:13:19.887 --> 00:13:23.766
In India people are afraid of everything!

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:28.040
If they can see a squirrel, they will be frightened.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.363
If they see a lizard – finished!

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.242
I mean they are afraid of anything,

00:13:38.363 --> 00:13:44.363
and the ladies in India are so afraid of even cockroaches!

00:13:45.202 --> 00:13:49.565
This kind of temperament is absolutely stupid!

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:58.605
Because that makes you a kind of a person who is prone to angina.

00:13:58.726 --> 00:14:01.605
What is there to be afraid of?

00:14:01.726 --> 00:14:04.928
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.605
you are not to be afraid of anything.

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:11.807
They are afraid of rats,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.847
all kinds of nonsense and they boast of it,

00:14:15.968 --> 00:14:18.081
and they talk about it.

00:14:18.202 --> 00:14:23.605
Here the heart is becoming weak and weak and weak.¶

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:29.121
Also, I must say, the Indian men are responsible for that.

00:14:29.242 --> 00:14:32.081
Because they treat their women as

00:14:32.202 --> 00:14:36.726
if they are appendages or some sort of a liability,

00:14:36.847 --> 00:14:39.242
I don’t know what they think they are.

00:14:39.363 --> 00:14:44.968
Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable!

00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:50.807
Especially in north India, I have seen, women have no position.

00:14:50.928 --> 00:14:56.161
The woman is brought in the house, kept in the house,

00:14:57.323 --> 00:14:59.726
just like a maidservant,

00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:02.887
she has to cover he face all the time,

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:09.040
she doesn’t have to go out anywhere without permission.

00:15:09.202 --> 00:15:11.121
It’s terrible!

00:15:11.242 --> 00:15:15.524
Some people say it is a Muslim influence or whatever it is.

00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:25.565
But when you believe in eternal life, in spiritual life,

00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:34.968
you should not be governed by any such nonsensical atrocities.¶

00:15:36.726 --> 00:15:39.605
And that’s why I feel

00:15:39.726 --> 00:15:44.161
that you really need the emancipation of women in India.

00:15:44.282 --> 00:15:50.403
They are very good, they are very tolerant, they are very sweet,

00:15:50.524 --> 00:15:58.968
but they develop all the bad diseases, all the mental diseases,

00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:03.524
because they don’t know their own value,

00:16:03.645 --> 00:16:06.928
they don’t know their own self-respect.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.363
And on this I have already spoken at length.

00:16:11.484 --> 00:16:14.766
Whey should men behave like that?

00:16:15.363 --> 00:16:22.766
I think in our country, we have at least seventy percent are women;

00:16:23.444 --> 00:16:29.847
and seventy percent people’s energy is wasted in the north India.

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:34.081
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:37.161
And then they are punished.

00:16:37.282 --> 00:16:41.403
All such countries can never prosper,

00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:45.444
because women are the Laxmis.

00:16:45.887 --> 00:16:49.000
But they have to be Laxmis also,

00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:52.081
they have to behave like Laxmis.

00:16:52.202 --> 00:16:57.161
But some of them come up like this that you are shocked.

00:16:57.403 --> 00:17:01.766
How can they be women, they look like devils?

00:17:02.081 --> 00:17:06.645
So such an imbalance in the society

00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:11.484
which is punished, again, by Shri Mahadeva.¶

00:17:12.968 --> 00:17:16.565
He is very kind,

00:17:16.686 --> 00:17:20.565
and he looks after the people who have to suffer it.

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:25.363
And he tries to punish people who make them suffer.

00:17:25.847 --> 00:17:31.282
It is his quality to help

00:17:31.403 --> 00:17:37.202
by destroying people who are aggressive.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.202
He doesn’t talk of any Kundalini,

00:17:41.323 --> 00:17:44.161
he doesn’t talk of Self Realisation,

00:17:44.282 --> 00:17:47.605
he just punishes them, nicely!

00:17:47.726 --> 00:17:52.363
In such a bad way that it’s shocking!

00:17:52.484 --> 00:17:55.887
And he relieves sometimes people like

00:17:55.968 --> 00:18:02.242
– I have seen many women who live like this, suffer so much.

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:07.726
They die much earlier than their ages.

00:18:08.363 --> 00:18:16.040
All this one has to see in the right perspective.

00:18:17.081 --> 00:18:21.484
He’s there to protect, of course,

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:24.766
but more to destroy.

00:18:24.968 --> 00:18:31.000
He protects all kinds of animals, all birds,

00:18:31.121 --> 00:18:34.766
all the nature, he protects.

00:18:35.726 --> 00:18:43.161
He is the one who brings all the joy,

00:18:43.282 --> 00:18:46.968
all the joy of spirituality.

00:18:47.081 --> 00:18:54.403
But if you try to become aggressive,

00:18:55.847 --> 00:19:00.242
then he is the one who will destroy.

00:19:00.605 --> 00:19:06.726
Sometimes he gives more long rope to hang,

00:19:06.847 --> 00:19:08.968
and so people think we are alright,

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:11.887
they are satisfied with themselves.¶

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.524
On the contrary, in the west I find,

00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:18.202
the women are ruling the men more than the men.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.403
Very surprising.

00:19:20.524 --> 00:19:23.887
I don’t know how they have handled the situation,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.565
but they are ruling, all the time,

00:19:26.686 --> 00:19:29.565
and the men have to be under their thumb

00:19:29.686 --> 00:19:32.282
– I don’t know how they have managed it –

00:19:32.403 --> 00:19:36.807
but they do it! They are not humble.

00:19:36.928 --> 00:19:39.565
They don’t love,

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:43.887
and they go on divorcing their husbands all the time.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.202
They do not love!

00:19:47.323 --> 00:19:49.807
They don’t know what is love is.

00:19:49.928 --> 00:19:56.524
But also, I have seen men don’t understand what love is in India.

00:19:56.645 --> 00:19:58.968
They don’t know how to love

00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:04.000
their wives, which is a life-partner.

00:20:04.121 --> 00:20:08.645
How to respect, they don’t understand.

00:20:08.766 --> 00:20:13.766
There, then comes a great wrath,

00:20:13.887 --> 00:20:18.403
and this wrath works in so many ways,

00:20:19.121 --> 00:20:22.242
in creating horrible diseases

00:20:22.363 --> 00:20:29.807
and in creating problems and problems for such men.¶

00:20:35.444 --> 00:20:40.282
And the society also is responsible

00:20:40.403 --> 00:20:47.686
for doing all kinds of things against humble people.

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:56.242
Both ways, one has to understand, that if you are aggressive,

00:20:56.363 --> 00:21:03.202
you are under the Third Eye of Shri Mahadeva.

00:21:04.081 --> 00:21:09.524
In any way if you are aggressive, say with your servants,

00:21:09.645 --> 00:21:13.484
if you are aggressive with your subordinates,

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:19.202
if you are aggressive with your children,

00:21:20.282 --> 00:21:25.686
there is this wrathful God watching,

00:21:25.766 --> 00:21:33.161
and one can get under the spell of his destruction.¶

00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:41.444
But he gives us the great heights of Himalaya.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:51.766
He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very noble,

00:21:52.363 --> 00:21:58.161
and he wants that people should love each other.

00:21:58.807 --> 00:22:02.928
There should be pure love among human beings.

00:22:03.766 --> 00:22:15.403
And also he makes you, very delicately,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.202
behaving towards other people;

00:22:21.323 --> 00:22:26.242
very sweetly behaving towards others.

00:22:26.807 --> 00:22:34.928
If you don’t have that, then you are going in the wrong direction.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.726
But his greatest privilege,

00:22:37.847 --> 00:22:42.645
that he gives you the height and the depth.

00:22:43.323 --> 00:22:51.524
If you are worshipping him, then you develop such heights

00:22:51.645 --> 00:22:56.807
that you see the whole world as a witness.¶

00:22:57.202 --> 00:23:05.282
He sees the whole world as a sakshi-swarupa, as a witness.

00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:11.686
And so he is the knowledge, he is the pure knowledge.

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:15.524
You may get your Realisation, alright;

00:23:16.444 --> 00:23:19.726
you might feel the cool breeze in your hands, alright;

00:23:19.847 --> 00:23:24.847
but do you have the knowledge?

00:23:24.968 --> 00:23:29.524
I have to tell you what finger means what,

00:23:29.645 --> 00:23:34.565
what hand means what, what is vibrations, I have to tell you.

00:23:34.686 --> 00:23:40.363
He is that knowledge, He is the pure knowledge,

00:23:40.484 --> 00:23:46.282
complete knowledge, of the highest level.¶

00:23:46.484 --> 00:23:51.040
So he is the source of knowledge.

00:23:51.282 --> 00:23:58.968
Those people who are not humble cannot get that knowledge.

00:23:59.524 --> 00:24:04.202
Those people who are arrogant

00:24:04.323 --> 00:24:11.242
and who do not handle others delicately, sweetly, beautifully,

00:24:12.363 --> 00:24:15.847
are not blessed by him.

00:24:15.968 --> 00:24:23.282
They cannot achieve anything in life.

00:24:23.403 --> 00:24:25.645
What do we have to achieve?

00:24:25.766 --> 00:24:32.807
Not your position, not your wealth, not all these outward things,

00:24:32.928 --> 00:24:37.403
but you have to achieve a loving heart!

00:24:37.524 --> 00:24:41.000
Heart with which you can love.¶

00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:45.323
If there is Shiva in your heart, you will love

00:24:45.444 --> 00:24:51.040
everyone in a very beautiful manner.

00:24:51.161 --> 00:24:56.121
There won’t be any nonsensical ideas about love.

00:24:56.242 --> 00:25:07.968
Just pure love, pure love for all the people.

00:25:08.363 --> 00:25:17.000
With the blessing, then all your harshness goes away.

00:25:17.403 --> 00:25:22.282
For example, if you have a little power, little power,

00:25:25.444 --> 00:25:29.000
so you start to misuse it.

00:25:29.686 --> 00:25:37.605
Look at Shiva, he has so many powers; if he starts misusing,

00:25:37.726 --> 00:25:42.282
there won’t be even a blade of grass left on this earth.

00:25:42.403 --> 00:25:49.242
How much you are sinful, selfish, you know that.

00:25:50.605 --> 00:25:52.968
But still he gives you a chance

00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:55.847
‘So let’s see, they might improve’.

00:25:55.968 --> 00:26:01.000
And he is extremely generous, extremely generous,

00:26:01.121 --> 00:26:07.282
he is very forgiving and also extremely generous.¶

00:26:07.807 --> 00:26:17.081
Now supposing there are people who are living in a desert

00:26:17.807 --> 00:26:21.766
and they are very good people,

00:26:21.887 --> 00:26:26.726
and they are suffering because they are living in a desert,

00:26:26.847 --> 00:26:32.202
he will create oasis for them, he controls the Mother Earth.

00:26:32.323 --> 00:26:36.282
He can do everything to make them happy,

00:26:36.403 --> 00:26:42.282
if they are spiritual, if they worship.

00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:46.565
But human beings are so stupid

00:26:46.686 --> 00:26:52.040
that they go on fighting also in the name of God.

00:26:52.161 --> 00:26:59.403
Like in the south we have two types of people,

00:26:59.524 --> 00:27:03.081
one who worships Shiva, another who worships Vishnu.

00:27:03.202 --> 00:27:04.766
Can you imagine!

00:27:05.565 --> 00:27:08.766
Vishnu used to worship Shiva!

00:27:08.887 --> 00:27:13.605
Nobody’s higher, nobody’s lower. It’s so important.

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:16.282
Everything is so important.

00:27:16.403 --> 00:27:21.645
But they used to fight on this point, if they are worshipping Shiva,

00:27:21.766 --> 00:27:24.726
or they are worshipping Vishnu,

00:27:24.847 --> 00:27:28.040
and nowhere near the reality they were.

00:27:28.161 --> 00:27:31.282
They didn’t know what was the reality, nothing,

00:27:31.403 --> 00:27:34.766
just fighting, fighting, fighting.¶

00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:40.968
In the name of God, those who fight, Shiva comes on them

00:27:41.121 --> 00:27:44.444
and with his trident hits them.

00:27:44.565 --> 00:27:47.242
You are not to fight in the name of God,

00:27:47.363 --> 00:27:50.484
but you have to love and understand.

00:27:50.605 --> 00:27:54.444
So this fighting in the name of God is a nonsense.

00:27:54.565 --> 00:27:57.887
Not only that but it’s very, very dangerous.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.726
All such people who do that will be destroyed.

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:08.968
It is self-destructive. Such people will be destroyed completely. ¶

00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:16.202
So, you should understand that in the name of God you have to love.

00:28:16.323 --> 00:28:18.484
You have to understand.

00:28:18.605 --> 00:28:21.726
You need not tolerate nonsenses, it’s different;

00:28:21.847 --> 00:28:27.968
but you have to love people, spread you love.

00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:33.444
Gradually this love can go all over, all over the world,

00:28:33.565 --> 00:28:39.645
and then the vision of mine I can see working out.

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:43.565
But if there is fighting, there’s hatred,

00:28:43.686 --> 00:28:46.202
there’s all kinds of aggressiveness,

00:28:46.323 --> 00:28:50.928
these are all against Shiva, and such people will be destroyed.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.444
What will I do with them?

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:56.807
What can I do if they are destroyed?

00:28:56.928 --> 00:29:02.645
If they are very money oriented, materialistic people,

00:29:02.766 --> 00:29:06.726
they are not loving them, they are loving only for money.

00:29:06.847 --> 00:29:10.847
All such people will be destroyed, no doubt.¶

00:29:10.968 --> 00:29:17.887
One should be not only humble, but should be extremely loving.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.887
To get the blessings of Shiva you have to be extremely loving.

00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:32.645
Such people may not be very cunning, clever,

00:29:32.766 --> 00:29:36.968
maybe very innocent – they must be.

00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:42.242
Because when you love somebody, you want to help that person.

00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:44.323
I have suffered myself,

00:29:44.444 --> 00:29:48.887
I have tried to help people and they have deceived me.

00:29:49.081 --> 00:29:51.847
So what? That’s their nature,

00:29:51.968 --> 00:29:54.524
and they are destroyed, what can I do?

00:29:54.645 --> 00:29:59.645
I didn’t ask them that you deceive me, but they deceived me

00:29:59.766 --> 00:30:01.887
– I don’t know why.

00:30:01.968 --> 00:30:06.242
And I have been very kind and nice, and still they deceived me.

00:30:06.363 --> 00:30:12.887
So when the destruction follows, what can I do about it?¶

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.081
I don’t want anybody to be destroyed,

00:30:16.202 --> 00:30:18.887
I love this creation of mine,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.766
and I don’t have

00:30:20.887 --> 00:30:27.242
any way of protecting them if they are destructive.

00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:34.565
Because there is another great power who can destroy them.

00:30:35.766 --> 00:30:41.605
See then, I am absolutely in a helpless condition, sometimes I feel

00:30:41.726 --> 00:30:44.282
and I don’t know how to express,

00:30:44.403 --> 00:30:47.766
but one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis

00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:54.524
that with Shiva’s love and his blessings

00:30:54.645 --> 00:31:03.686
you can become extremely loving, extremely generous,

00:31:03.807 --> 00:31:12.040
very, very sweet and innocent like children.¶

00:31:12.766 --> 00:31:16.000
You have to be innocent.

00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:19.887
There is no need to be very clever and cunning

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.686
and you will be amazed how your innocence will be protected.

00:31:28.807 --> 00:31:33.524
If you are innocent, you don’t have to worry,

00:31:33.968 --> 00:31:43.403
there’s a power, the Third Eye of Shiva looking after you.

00:31:43.524 --> 00:31:46.847
Wherever you are going, he is with you.

00:31:46.968 --> 00:31:50.403
That doesn’t mean that you become stupid.

00:31:50.524 --> 00:31:56.565
It doesn’t mean that you are not practical.

00:31:56.686 --> 00:32:01.484
All that is taken over, all the practical side,

00:32:01.605 --> 00:32:04.242
by the power of Shiva.

00:32:04.363 --> 00:32:11.081
His guidance, his love, his kindness,

00:32:11.202 --> 00:32:15.363
you can see at every, every step of life.¶

00:32:15.484 --> 00:32:18.282
But first of all, watch your steps!

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:22.968
Are you aggressive? Are you troublesome?

00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:28.323
Do you say harsh things to others?

00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:33.484
Or are you humble? Are you gentle?

00:32:33.605 --> 00:32:39.081
And if you are kind, he is very much pleased.¶

00:32:39.202 --> 00:32:45.565
In the nature, it is His rule that works.

00:32:46.202 --> 00:32:49.081
And they (animals) are so systematic,

00:32:49.202 --> 00:32:57.121
they live with understanding of each other.

00:32:57.242 --> 00:33:13.565
For example, if you go in the jungle and it is absolutely quiet,

00:33:14.323 --> 00:33:17.524
and you don’t even hear the birds twittering:

00:33:17.645 --> 00:33:21.766
then you should know there is a tiger sitting some way.

00:33:21.887 --> 00:33:26.444
Because he is the king. They know they have to obey,

00:33:26.565 --> 00:33:30.605
and when the king is there, his protocol is there.

00:33:30.726 --> 00:33:33.766
They know automatically what is the protocol of the king.

00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:38.484
Nobody would be even moving if he is there.

00:33:38.605 --> 00:33:41.363
He sits in his majesty.

00:33:41.484 --> 00:33:46.847
Then in one week, or maybe fifteen days he will kill one animal.

00:33:46.968 --> 00:33:48.766
He has to eat.

00:33:48.887 --> 00:33:57.726
He kills one animal then he and his family, they eat first.

00:33:57.807 --> 00:34:02.403
He waits for some time, of course, for the blood to ooze out,

00:34:02.524 --> 00:34:06.081
then the whole family comes and eats.

00:34:06.202 --> 00:34:09.484
Then he leaves the body there.

00:34:09.605 --> 00:34:16.242
Then by gradation, one by one, all kinds of animals come

00:34:16.363 --> 00:34:19.444
and eat it as a prasad.

00:34:19.565 --> 00:34:28.484
And the last thing are the crows who come and eat that animal.

00:34:28.605 --> 00:34:33.887
Such discipline, such understanding of the protocol;

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I am amazed how animals are managed by Shiva.¶

00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:47.766
You never hear that animals are having a ‘strike’,

00:34:47.887 --> 00:34:55.040
or animals are having a big ‘underworld’ animals!

00:34:55.161 --> 00:35:02.323
You don’t hear that these animals are stealing things.

00:35:02.444 --> 00:35:08.161
And just imagine, we are coming from that animal life,

00:35:08.282 --> 00:35:11.121
but we are worse than them.

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:16.444
How are we going to rise if we have all such funny ideas

00:35:16.565 --> 00:35:22.040
of behaving in such a manner of fighting.

00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:25.968
On any small little excuse they will fight,

00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:28.363
they will start fighting.

00:35:28.484 --> 00:35:31.726
Animals also fight a little bit among themselves,

00:35:31.847 --> 00:35:34.524
but not in a collective way.

00:35:34.645 --> 00:35:38.524
They don’t do it in a collective way as we do it here.

00:35:41.081 --> 00:35:45.726
It is really at the slightest provocation

00:35:45.847 --> 00:35:49.807
we get into groups and start fighting.

00:35:49.928 --> 00:35:53.928
They get into groups but they don’t fight.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.081
What is the thing among them?

00:35:56.202 --> 00:36:02.686
Everything is so much, so much understood by animals,

00:36:02.807 --> 00:36:09.807
why not for us also to understand the law of nature?¶

00:36:09.928 --> 00:36:11.968
It is Mahadeva

00:36:12.081 --> 00:36:19.565
who manages that all the nature’s law are to be obeyed.

00:36:19.686 --> 00:36:24.121
Even the Mother Earth, the sky, everything,

00:36:24.242 --> 00:36:27.847
is looked after by him.

00:36:27.968 --> 00:36:31.524
He does nice, nice, beautiful things for us.

00:36:31.645 --> 00:36:34.444
With the changing of the seasons,

00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:39.202
he creates these beautiful flowers;

00:36:39.323 --> 00:36:44.484
he creates all that is soothing and joy-giving and beautiful,

00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:46.363
he looks after.

00:36:46.484 --> 00:36:51.686
He gives us to see what nature has given us,

00:36:51.807 --> 00:36:58.766
and tries to please us, keep us happy, entertain,

00:36:58.887 --> 00:37:01.565
like an innocent child.

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:05.323
But while we are, in our arrogance,

00:37:05.444 --> 00:37:09.524
we have our reactions – to everything!

00:37:09.807 --> 00:37:13.645
You see a carpet, you will say “I don’t like it!”

00:37:13.766 --> 00:37:16.524
Especially in the west, it is a common

00:37:16.645 --> 00:37:18.444
thing to say “I don’t like it”.

00:37:18.565 --> 00:37:23.403
Who are you not to like something, or to dislike something?

00:37:23.524 --> 00:37:25.968
What do you think of yourself?

00:37:26.081 --> 00:37:29.484
It’s very common, and shamelessly they will say

00:37:29.605 --> 00:37:35.686
“I don’t like this, I like it …” It’s impossible!

00:37:35.766 --> 00:37:39.202
Such human beings, I don’t know where they will go,

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:41.202
what will happen to them.

00:37:41.323 --> 00:37:47.323
Instead of appreciating, instead of enjoying everything,

00:37:47.444 --> 00:37:52.484
why to start criticizing and reacting.¶

00:37:52.605 --> 00:37:55.323
Reaction is much more in the west, I must say,

00:37:55.444 --> 00:37:57.282
not so much in India.

00:37:57.403 --> 00:38:03.605
But there are certain cultural differences, I think,

00:38:03.726 --> 00:38:05.928
that’s why people say like that.

00:38:06.081 --> 00:38:08.040
Here if somebody says like that,

00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:10.524
people will think that person is mad or that

00:38:10.645 --> 00:38:13.524
something is wrong with him, the way he talks.¶

00:38:13.645 --> 00:38:19.040
It is important how you express your love,

00:38:19.161 --> 00:38:23.000
how you talk about your love.

00:38:23.121 --> 00:38:26.484
Start it with your wife, to begin with,

00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:31.323
and then you can move towards your children and other people.

00:38:31.403 --> 00:38:33.565
And we are so stupid sometimes,

00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:37.726
that we love the whole world but we can’t love our wives!

00:38:37.847 --> 00:38:41.766
It’s a specialty! In India that’s very true,

00:38:41.887 --> 00:38:45.565
but also in the west I have seen people love their wives

00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:50.645
because of fear – fear of divorce maybe, I don’t know –.

00:38:51.524 --> 00:39:00.726
Love should have no fear. It should be just ‘free’ love.

00:39:00.968 --> 00:39:10.121
Without any fear, without any aggression, enjoy that pure love.

00:39:10.242 --> 00:39:16.726
And that is what is missing in the human beings today as it is.¶

00:39:16.847 --> 00:39:21.686
When the day will come when human beings will

00:39:21.766 --> 00:39:27.363
be understanding the beauty of love,

00:39:27.484 --> 00:39:36.403
then from the heavens there will be flowers falling on us,

00:39:36.524 --> 00:39:42.928
it would be such a tremendous day when

00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:52.928
Mahadeva will be able to close his Third Eye

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.282
and would be peaceful in his heart.

00:39:56.403 --> 00:39:59.605
It is my vision.

00:39:59.726 --> 00:40:03.726
It’s the future for you;

00:40:03.847 --> 00:40:10.444
to see how peacefully you can talk to people,

00:40:10.565 --> 00:40:16.645
how sweetly you can love others,

00:40:17.323 --> 00:40:20.928
how much you can give to others.¶

00:40:21.081 --> 00:40:27.161
For example, they have to give something,

00:40:27.403 --> 00:40:31.282
they’ll go in the market and buy the cheapest,

00:40:31.403 --> 00:40:35.605
the rottenest thing for giving.

00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:39.040
That’s not the way.

00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:45.565
You must buy small or big, whatever it is, out of love!

00:40:45.686 --> 00:40:48.565
That (thing) should talk about your love,

00:40:48.686 --> 00:40:51.000
tell about your love,

00:40:51.121 --> 00:40:55.081
and not about your money and what you have spent.

00:40:55.202 --> 00:40:59.242
It’s very common nowadays, even in India,

00:40:59.363 --> 00:41:05.686
that people try to show how much they are worth,

00:41:05.807 --> 00:41:09.726
what they wear, how they dress up.

00:41:09.847 --> 00:41:18.968
For what? For what? I’ve known such people, very many,

00:41:19.121 --> 00:41:22.444
and when they die there are not even four people available

00:41:22.565 --> 00:41:25.565
to carry their dead bodies!

00:41:25.686 --> 00:41:29.323
When they lived they think no end of themselves.

00:41:29.484 --> 00:41:36.040
That time, you should see how many people there are

00:41:36.726 --> 00:41:41.645
to love that person, to care for that person.

00:41:41.766 --> 00:41:46.928
Maybe it is the upbringing,

00:41:47.081 --> 00:41:49.807
maybe, that he had never known love,

00:41:49.928 --> 00:41:51.928
anything you may blame.¶

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.363
But for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to learn

00:41:56.484 --> 00:42:04.524
that love is your life, love is spirituality, and love

00:42:04.645 --> 00:42:09.686
– without expectations – to do something.

00:42:09.807 --> 00:42:13.565
Some people are, I know, very good at helping

00:42:13.686 --> 00:42:16.161
poor people, this, that.

00:42:16.282 --> 00:42:22.242
But behind that is the power that …

00:42:24.161 --> 00:42:27.726
They think “Oh, we are great, we are doing this work, that work”

00:42:27.847 --> 00:42:32.282
just to satisfy their power, not their love.

00:42:32.403 --> 00:42:35.686
So when you are working,

00:42:35.807 --> 00:42:41.081
you have to know that it’s just to satisfy your Spirit,

00:42:41.202 --> 00:42:45.161
just to satisfy your love that you are doing it,

00:42:45.282 --> 00:42:52.807
not for any name or for any kind of a position.

00:42:52.928 --> 00:43:01.363
If you have that kind of a detached love,

00:43:01.484 --> 00:43:08.000
virakta as they call it, then nobody has to certify you.

00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:14.161
You have it, and you are enjoying it!¶

00:43:16.847 --> 00:43:22.282
It is unfortunate I have to speak in English language,

00:43:22.403 --> 00:43:26.605
and maybe there are some who do not understand English,

00:43:26.726 --> 00:43:31.726
but nowadays English has become dominating, what to do?

00:43:31.847 --> 00:43:35.363
You have to suppose people will read  English language.

00:43:35.484 --> 00:43:39.242
I can’t use any other language.

00:43:39.645 --> 00:43:45.928
But one has to speak the language of love.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:51.726
You see animals, you see if you have a horse

00:43:51.847 --> 00:43:53.645
and if you have a dog,

00:43:53.766 --> 00:44:00.484
all these animals, they understand your love;

00:44:00.968 --> 00:44:07.323
how they stick to you, how they express their love,

00:44:07.444 --> 00:44:09.968
they are very sweet.

00:44:11.121 --> 00:44:16.081
And this we have to learn from them now, I think.

00:44:16.202 --> 00:44:20.807
Otherwise I don’t know how to make them understand

00:44:20.887 --> 00:44:23.645
the value of love.

00:44:24.766 --> 00:44:32.968
It is not that the way people are criticising:

00:44:33.081 --> 00:44:38.524
that we are not practical, that we have not

00:44:38.645 --> 00:44:47.282
achieved much money or power or something, that’s not important.

00:44:47.807 --> 00:44:53.081
Because there are many like that selling in the market.¶

00:44:53.524 --> 00:45:01.766
But we are different. We are the jewels of humanity,

00:45:01.887 --> 00:45:05.040
and we have to be like that, shining,

00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:10.242
cutting out all the wrong things within us

00:45:10.363 --> 00:45:17.605
as a diamond is cut to look something very, very great.¶

00:45:18.444 --> 00:45:26.161
My only, if I have any desire, is that:

00:45:26.282 --> 00:45:34.121
‘Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva’.

00:45:34.766 --> 00:45:44.928
How great he is, how detached he is, detached, absolutely detached.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:52.242
He lives with bones and things like that.

00:45:52.887 --> 00:45:56.726
He is not bothered about where he is, what he lives with,

00:45:56.847 --> 00:46:00.000
what he has, nothing.

00:46:00.484 --> 00:46:05.323
So detached, and we should be detached like that.¶

00:46:05.444 --> 00:46:10.524
At the same time, we should be very loving like him,

00:46:10.645 --> 00:46:14.000
extremely loving.

00:46:14.121 --> 00:46:18.686
How his heart is full of love for others,

00:46:18.807 --> 00:46:21.686
how he looks after others.

00:46:21.807 --> 00:46:28.363
I am warning you, because I know you all love me very much,

00:46:28.484 --> 00:46:31.766
but you should also love each other,

00:46:31.887 --> 00:46:34.887
you should have a loving heart,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.363
and have satisfaction in loving others.

00:46:40.484 --> 00:46:45.444
If you could develop that, your height will grow,

00:46:45.565 --> 00:46:50.524
your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow.

00:46:50.645 --> 00:46:55.968
It’s alright, the Goddess gives you the shraddha, alright,

00:46:56.121 --> 00:47:00.282
but the depth in shraddha,

00:47:01.484 --> 00:47:06.121
in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don’t know,

00:47:06.242 --> 00:47:10.444
but in Marathi they call it dyas.

00:47:10.565 --> 00:47:17.081
Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love,

00:47:17.202 --> 00:47:20.323
enjoying that love – then you don’t want anything.

00:47:20.444 --> 00:47:25.040
What do you want? You’ve got everything.

00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:27.645
So what do you want now?

00:47:27.766 --> 00:47:36.282
Just like the greatness of Shri Mahadeva.

00:47:36.403 --> 00:47:42.121
He’s so great that he’s detached.

00:47:42.242 --> 00:47:46.040
What does he want? I mean nothing is greater than him,

00:47:46.161 --> 00:47:50.444
nothing is more important than him. Then what does he want?

00:47:50.565 --> 00:47:56.282
He doesn’t want anything. That’s why he’s detached.

00:47:56.403 --> 00:48:01.887
This detachment you have to develop.¶

00:48:01.968 --> 00:48:08.121
But at the same time he is the Lord of all the arts,

00:48:08.242 --> 00:48:12.524
of the music, of the rhythm.

00:48:12.645 --> 00:48:17.040
The other day you saw these boys were playing the rhythm.

00:48:17.161 --> 00:48:20.766
The whole rhythm of everything he gives.

00:48:20.887 --> 00:48:29.363
The rhythmic life that we have, we are not yet aware of it.

00:48:29.484 --> 00:48:39.121
See a child is born exactly after nine months and so-many days.

00:48:39.242 --> 00:48:42.282
Who keeps this rhythm?

00:48:43.202 --> 00:48:48.202
Then we get, say, certain flowers at such-and-such time,

00:48:48.323 --> 00:48:54.686
then we get in the nature all kinds of seasons.

00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:57.081
Who keeps the rhythm?

00:48:57.202 --> 00:49:02.161
He is the one who is nothing but rhythm!

00:49:02.282 --> 00:49:06.928
And that rhythm is kept up, in the nature,

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.282
in everything there is a rhythm.

00:49:10.403 --> 00:49:17.363
And a rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart!

00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:21.121
It’s like an ocean.¶

00:49:21.242 --> 00:49:26.444
You get just that rhythm disturbed immediately if you

00:49:26.565 --> 00:49:31.928
find somebody who is being very cruel, very bad and all that.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:40.565
But in a smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake,

00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:45.323
there is no ripple at all, it is just love.

00:49:45.403 --> 00:49:48.605
And then at that time, if the rhythm,

00:49:48.726 --> 00:49:53.847
the silent rhythm of that heart is broken,

00:49:53.968 --> 00:49:57.081
then Shiva takes charge.

00:49:57.202 --> 00:50:04.565
So one has to have a complete sense of the rhythm of time,

00:50:04.686 --> 00:50:09.928
rhythm of nature, rhythm of everything.

00:50:10.081 --> 00:50:13.403
People don’t know even the names of the flowers.

00:50:13.524 --> 00:50:16.605
They don’t know what these flowers are,

00:50:16.726 --> 00:50:19.565
what time they come up;

00:50:19.686 --> 00:50:26.484
they have no idea what is the rhythm of their ‘living’

00:50:26.605 --> 00:50:28.565
– nobody’s bothered.¶

00:50:28.686 --> 00:50:33.807
All over, if you see, there is seasons and things.

00:50:33.928 --> 00:50:40.323
So all the rhythm, like his play, with tabla or pakwaj

00:50:40.444 --> 00:50:48.323
on which he played all the beautiful tunes of all the seasons.

00:50:48.444 --> 00:50:52.242
And that’s how the nature flourishes

00:50:52.363 --> 00:50:57.121
and comes up and then subsides.¶

00:50:57.242 --> 00:51:00.202
We do not see that point.

00:51:00.282 --> 00:51:04.282
We are just bothered about ourselves.

00:51:04.403 --> 00:51:06.726
Like I’ll ask “How are you?”

00:51:06.847 --> 00:51:10.403
“Mother, I’ve got a headache, I’ve got a stomach trouble,

00:51:10.524 --> 00:51:15.040
I have another trouble” … or everything is there.

00:51:15.161 --> 00:51:20.524
But another one would say “Ah, I’m alright!”

00:51:20.645 --> 00:51:22.282
“So, what’s the matter?”

00:51:22.403 --> 00:51:24.605
“Put the world right Mamma!

00:51:24.726 --> 00:51:27.121
Mother, why don’t you put the world right?”

00:51:27.242 --> 00:51:33.000
He’s worried about others, not about himself.

00:51:33.121 --> 00:51:39.121
And in that understanding of what one should do

00:51:39.242 --> 00:51:42.847
to make this world happy, beautiful,

00:51:42.968 --> 00:51:47.726
for that one has to really work hard, so called,

00:51:47.847 --> 00:51:51.887
and in that working one thinks,

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:58.081
“Isn’t it our duty to make this world beautiful?

00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:01.565
Isn’t it our job to make

00:52:01.686 --> 00:52:06.807
this world rhythmic, rhyming with the Spirit?”

00:52:06.928 --> 00:52:09.968
It’s our duty. We have to do it!

00:52:10.081 --> 00:52:16.565
Not only taking Sahaja Yoga for yourself, but for others.

00:52:16.686 --> 00:52:20.161
It’s not you are all the time worried about yourself,

00:52:20.282 --> 00:52:23.887
but you are worried about others,

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.887
what’s happening in the world.

00:52:27.968 --> 00:52:33.928
That is love! That love is spontaneous,

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:38.444
and when it works, it works wonders.¶

00:52:43.524 --> 00:52:48.444
So this is a beautiful evening,

00:52:49.242 --> 00:53:00.807
where we are worshipping such a great source of our ascent.

00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:06.323
And I hope you people will understand

00:53:06.444 --> 00:53:11.000
how far you are with that force,

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:16.202
how much are you drenched in that force,

00:53:16.323 --> 00:53:22.847
in that rhythm of Shiva,

00:53:22.968 --> 00:53:28.323
who, in his rhythmic way, gives you vibrations.

00:53:28.444 --> 00:53:33.121
Vibrations flow in the way we live,

00:53:33.242 --> 00:53:39.000
and that way should engulf you completely;

00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:43.766
and you should be asked in that your ‘I-ness’

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:47.766
should be dissolved in that which is I bless you.

00:53:47.887 --> 00:53:49.403
Thank you.¶

00:53:56.202 --> 00:54:04.040
Today we have a Ganesha Puja, a small Ganesha Puja,

00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:07.766
then Shiva Puja and then the Devi’s Puja.¶

00:54:07.887 --> 00:54:09.242
May God Bless You
