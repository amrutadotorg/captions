00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:15.363
Shri Ganesha is the source of purity, of purity.

00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:21.711
The first thing established in this world was purity .

00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:28.305
So that, whatever living beings, the human beings

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:32.482
all those who came into this world

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:38.390
should be protected by purity.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.960
and be away from impure things.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:57.288
That is why, the whole creation
was drenched with purity by Gauri ji.

00:00:57.368 --> 00:01:02.240
And after that the creation came into existence.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.450
So in our lives, the most important work is that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.054
that within ourselves, we should
place purity at the highest level.

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:23.402
But purity does not mean

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:26.884
that we take our bath, wash ourselves

00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:32.169
clean up, keep our body alright

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:37.609
but to clean our hearts.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.142
The biggest disorder of the heart is anger.

00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:47.726
Anger is the highest disorder of heart.

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:52.695
And when a man gets angry

00:01:52.775 --> 00:02:02.532
that which is purity gets destroyed.

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:10.473
Because another name of purity is selfless love.

00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:19.588
That love which always flows and does not expect anything.

00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:25.011
The satisfaction of this love is that it is just flowing.

00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:32.799
And when it does not flow, it gets suffocated and disturbed.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:42.145
So, purity means that you fill
your heart with love, not with anger.

00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:47.485
Anger is in any case our enemy

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:58.558
but, it is the enemy of the whole world.

00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:02.358
All the wars that have taken place in the whole world

00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:04.577
all the losses that have taken place

00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:11.211
have been because of collective anger.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.080
There are many excuses for anger.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.390
I got angry because this thing had happened.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.733
I got angry because that thing had happened.

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:25.879
Man can always find some reason to get angry.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:34.490
But even extremely destructive things
like war are there because of this anger.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.225
The basic reason behind that is anger.

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:45.352
If our heart is full of love, we cannot get angry.

00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:51.523
Now, the other meaning of 'yog' is 'Yukti ', means a trick.

00:03:51.603 --> 00:04:01.309
First, is that there should be
connection, but the second is “Yukti”.

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:10.996
This 'Yukti' should be understood. What is this trick?

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:15.967
It can be made to understand in 3 ways.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:21.747
First, Yukti is that we must have the knowledge about it.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.236
Knowledge does not mean "Intelligence"

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:29.575
but in our fingers, in our hands

00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:35.961
inside, the complete awakening
of the Kundalini is knowledge.

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:38.434
And when you have this kind of knowledge

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:42.234
then you start having more knowledge also.

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:46.538
Many things, which you could not understand
(earlier) you start understanding now.

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:52.316
Now you understand who is truthful and who is not.

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:57.088
And with this knowledge you
can awaken the Kundalini of others

00:04:57.168 --> 00:04:59.576
and then you can even explain to them.

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:08.204
And you can perfectly be one with them.

00:05:08.284 --> 00:05:14.966
You can communicate with them,
talk to them about this knowledge.

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:20.833
So, because of this knowledge,
you get intellectual knowledge too.

00:05:20.913 --> 00:05:23.138
You understand Sahajyoga.

00:05:23.218 --> 00:05:25.406
Otherwise could anybody understand this earlier?

00:05:25.486 --> 00:05:33.522
“Ida Pingala Sukhamana Nadi Re, Ek Hi Dor Udaunga”

00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:40.099
So, this kind of talk Kabira used to
do, would anybody understand him?

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:43.226
Did anybody understand Nanaka ?

00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:47.062
Or did anybody understand Gyaneshwara ji?

00:05:47.142 --> 00:05:50.003
Nobody understood LaoTsé?

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:54.298
The saints are saying something
very mysterious and secretive

00:05:54.378 --> 00:05:56.920
taking it like that.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.116
But after being in Sahajayoga,
you started understanding everything.

00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:03.563
So, even your intellectual cleverness too increased.

00:06:03.643 --> 00:06:06.314
That too became more clever. You started understanding it.

00:06:06.394 --> 00:06:10.677
It is good that you started understanding it.

00:06:10.757 --> 00:06:14.163
And whatever was secret became understandable.

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:19.614
Also you have been able to understand everything.

00:06:19.694 --> 00:06:24.351
The first Yukti is that you have increased your knowledge.

00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:28.340
Now what is the second Yukti?

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.358
That is when you have devotion towards Me.

00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:44.324
Now when you have this Bhakti, it should do Ananya-Bhakti

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:53.379
Means that you have to become one with Me.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:59.745
For example, you start thinking as I think.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.392
Sometimes, I think!

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:15.096
"Mother,even today this man is
so bad. He is like this, like that".

00:07:15.176 --> 00:07:19.246
I say,"No, he’s a very good man, an excellent man

00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:21.672
how do you say like that?

00:07:21.752 --> 00:07:23.751
How did you say like that?"

00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:28.542
Then I start wondering, why they are not seeing what I see?

00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:32.563
If they are seeing through My
eyes, they should also see what I see.

00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:37.734
But it is not so, they are seeing something else.

00:07:37.814 --> 00:07:45.220
So, this is not 'Ananya' (one). This is 'Anya' (other).

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.955
In the same way as My love is there for you

00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:52.831
and I am satisfied only with one thing

00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.833
that you have same love for others.

00:07:55.913 --> 00:07:59.297
If that thing is not there

00:07:59.377 --> 00:08:07.002
In that case I feel that it is ' anya'
(separated) and not 'ananya' (one).

00:08:07.082 --> 00:08:16.149
If everybody is a part of My body,
then they should become like Me.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:20.907
They should think like Me

00:08:20.987 --> 00:08:25.480
They should do, what I am doing.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.090
Why do they think differently?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.423
Why do they think the opposite?

00:08:32.503 --> 00:08:40.354
From where do these strange thoughts come to their mind?

00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:43.131
So, this is not 'Ananya' bhakti (devotion).

00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:53.632
This bhakti is your individual way.

00:08:53.712 --> 00:09:04.168
So, your thought process, your work and your love

00:09:04.248 --> 00:09:13.091
it should be just the same as you love Me.

00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:16.216
And if this is the source of love

00:09:16.296 --> 00:09:21.025
whatever is in the well, should come out in the bucket.

00:09:21.105 --> 00:09:23.977
How can anything else come in the bucket?

00:09:24.057 --> 00:09:26.741
And when something else comes

00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:36.707
then I feel that they have taken
the water from some other well.

00:09:36.787 --> 00:09:45.323
This is not my bucket.

00:09:45.403 --> 00:09:47.804
Now the third yukti is that

00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:52.343
when i told you the second thing

00:09:52.423 --> 00:09:58.703
that you keep within you, an Ananya Shakti.

00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:05.523
Mother, "I am surrendered to
You. I am very much surrendered".

00:10:05.603 --> 00:10:09.238
So, if you are surrendered, then if I tell you something

00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:11.637
or explain you something

00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:19.977
or keep some proposal or something before you

00:10:20.057 --> 00:10:23.152
how can the question of refusal arise in that?

00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:29.542
If you and Me are one, why should this question arise?

00:10:29.622 --> 00:10:31.985
Mother has said, "so it is oK".

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:36.113
Because, we have become Mother only, how can we say," No"?

00:10:36.193 --> 00:10:40.421
For example, you can see My eye

00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:44.884
So, My eye knows that you are sitting in front of Me

00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:47.459
because My eyes are Mine.

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:49.820
So, whatever is My understanding

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.684
there is no difference between that
and the understanding of My eyes .

00:10:53.764 --> 00:10:55.163
It is one and the same thing.

00:10:55.243 --> 00:11:03.179
What I am understanding through My intelligence
that I am understanding through my eyes also.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:09.920
Then you did't get what is called, 'oneness' with Me.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.486
So, this is another yukti, "Mother please come to My heart

00:11:16.566 --> 00:11:19.403
come into my head, come into my thoughts

00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:22.196
come into every moment of my life".

00:11:22.276 --> 00:11:26.328
Wherever you ask Me, I am available with folded hands.

00:11:26.408 --> 00:11:30.719
I am ready, but you will have to say

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:33.779
and will have to say, with full heart.

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:39.847
If you connect with Me with the aim of getting benifitted

00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:42.090
even then it is not good.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.229
But once the connection is established

00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:48.754
then all the purposes will be automatically achieved.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:50.982
You won’t have to do anything.

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:55.346
When all the purposes will be achieved automatically

00:11:55.426 --> 00:12:00.366
your attention will be in that only.

00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:03.261
Now the third thing is that

00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:05.484
that we are doing this work

00:12:05.564 --> 00:12:09.651
we have done this work of Sahajyoga.

00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:14.568
We decorated this, set this right

00:12:14.648 --> 00:12:20.683
I did this, then you are not a Sahajyogi.

00:12:20.763 --> 00:12:24.425
In Sahajyoga, your all karmas(actions)
should become Akarmas (non actions).

00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:35.932
But," I am doing something, I have
written this poem i have done this".

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:42.751
When, you see it once very subtly,

00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:49.779
" Do I really think like that, that I have done this

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:52.614
does it come to my mind?"

00:12:52.694 --> 00:12:55.932
That means, my yoga (connection) is not yet complete.

00:12:56.012 --> 00:13:00.686
When your yoga is complete, you will not think like that.

00:13:00.766 --> 00:13:04.027
You cannot think at all, thoughts wiill not be there

00:13:04.107 --> 00:13:06.032
You are in Akarma.

00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:10.107
"This is happening, that is
happening, all that is happening".

00:13:10.187 --> 00:13:13.627
You start talking like this

00:13:13.707 --> 00:13:19.014
And then we should say that you are at one with Me.

00:13:19.094 --> 00:13:24.191
Like My hand is doing some
work. Does it say," I am doing this".

00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:29.621
It does not even know that it is doing, it is happening.

00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:32.684
[Not Clear] I am only doing.

00:13:32.764 --> 00:13:34.922
But if he starts thinking," I am doing

00:13:35.002 --> 00:13:37.539
that means that my hand is cut off.

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:40.486
It is not connected.

00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:42.786
If it is connected, then he will never feel

00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:49.662
that,"I am moving, i am walking,
i am holding", he never feels.

00:13:49.742 --> 00:13:57.269
And when you feel that I am
doing, then chaitanya says," Do it".

00:13:57.349 --> 00:13:59.268
And then biggest of all problems starts.

00:13:59.348 --> 00:14:00.901
This is third yukti (trick).

00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:05.060
You should learn that trick, where i am doing something.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:11.998
For a moment you should introspect.
Am i doing. What am i doing?

00:14:12.078 --> 00:14:14.790
Till you were searching self realization

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.931
till then you were doing something

00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:19.728
because, you had ego.

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:25.689
You were single individual, you were in VYASHTI, (alone).

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:28.162
Now when you are in SAMASHTI (collective)

00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:33.727
when you have come in the
collective, you are not doing anything.

00:14:33.807 --> 00:14:37.484
You are just a part and parcel of that
collective and that work is being done.

00:14:37.564 --> 00:14:39.891
This is the third Yukti that you should understand.

00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:42.583
I am trying to tell you all these Yuktis because

00:14:42.663 --> 00:14:48.158
you have to take a jump now (into the new dimension).

00:14:48.238 --> 00:14:52.777
In this way, you should always try to introspect.

00:14:52.857 --> 00:14:55.470
And pay attention to yourself.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.207
Sahajayoga is a very great thing. It is a very unique thing.

00:15:00.287 --> 00:15:02.926
But the drawback we have

00:15:03.006 --> 00:15:08.319
but the reason that even now we are not able to enjoy it

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:12.051
its reason is that there is some
or the other drawback in us.

00:15:12.131 --> 00:15:16.872
And on getting all this

00:15:16.952 --> 00:15:23.013
if we are able to master this Yukti

00:15:23.093 --> 00:15:25.133
what will you get?

00:15:25.213 --> 00:15:31.280
Only Joy! Nirananda! And nothing else!

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.466
And then what else do you want?

00:15:34.546 --> 00:15:36.872
Your face itself will change.

00:15:36.952 --> 00:15:40.326
You will drench only in joy!

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:46.006
And today, on My Birthday

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:50.980
I would like that that your
birthday too might be celebrated.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.544
That from today, we understand this Yukhti

00:15:55.624 --> 00:16:02.125
and fill ourselves with purity, like Shri Ganesha.

00:16:02.205 --> 00:16:07.001
Only with purity can the wisdom settle down in human beings.

00:16:07.081 --> 00:16:11.546
Because the other name of love is 'Purity'.

00:16:11.626 --> 00:16:16.720
But wisdom also means love only.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.862
Every thing means love.

00:16:19.942 --> 00:16:26.452
If you are not able to acquire this wisdom

00:16:26.532 --> 00:16:30.538
and don't consider 'Love' as your own

00:16:30.618 --> 00:16:35.355
You are wasting your time by coming to Sahajyoga.

00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:39.767
Now the time has come as such

00:16:39.847 --> 00:16:42.629
that everybody has to be united

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:45.772
and have to transform ourselves.

00:16:45.852 --> 00:16:51.064
We have to transform ourselves, we have drawbacks.

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:55.580
We have to purify ourselves completely.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.690
How much you are loving yourself

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.616
So, you all be in that state of joy!

00:17:03.696 --> 00:17:06.030
you all achieve that state of joy!

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.597
and in that joy, you be joyous!

00:17:10.677 --> 00:17:13.034
These are My blessings!
