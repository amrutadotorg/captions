00:07.542 --> 00:12.667
First of all you have to learn how to drive, then you are tested.

00:12.792 --> 00:16.334
There will be five stones put together,

00:16.459 --> 00:20.792
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through

00:20.918 --> 00:23.792
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

00:23.876 --> 00:25.876
And you cannot do it.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.042
Why?

00:29.417 --> 00:34.125
That’s how he makes you a master.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.500
The mastery of your attention

00:38.626 --> 00:44.876
will come when you will start seeing
that it is all a myth that upsets you.

00:45.292 --> 00:48.417
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

00:48.542 --> 00:51.125
Just throw it away.

00:53.083 --> 00:56.584
Just throw it away and understand

00:56.709 --> 01:01.667
that you are the eternal attention,

01:03.083 --> 01:07.626
that you are the eternal life,

01:08.209 --> 01:14.125
that [the] only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance,

01:14.918 --> 01:19.125
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

01:19.250 --> 01:23.626
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

01:24.751 --> 01:28.209
Just drop it! It’s all myth!

01:29.083 --> 01:34.500
You’ll be amazed how your attention will rise

01:35.626 --> 01:39.667
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

01:39.834 --> 01:43.250
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

01:43.375 --> 01:47.834
will drop out, and you will just smile at it.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.667
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself fully

01:52.792 --> 01:55.000
because your attention

01:55.125 --> 02:00.459
will be completely drenched into the bliss of Self.

02:03.083 --> 02:07.834
I am saying you will, I say you are

02:09.083 --> 02:13.626
already drenched into that bliss.

02:14.751 --> 02:16.792
Keep it up.

02:17.292 --> 02:20.792
Now, how to do it?

02:22.626 --> 02:29.375
Actually, in every day-to-day life,
how to kill the memory of the past?

02:33.125 --> 02:38.500
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories.

02:40.334 --> 02:44.626
You must remember when you got your first Realisation

02:46.542 --> 02:48.334
– always think of it.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.834
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

02:51.959 --> 02:56.375
you [should] try to think how you got your Realisation.

02:57.209 --> 03:02.500
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating,

03:02.626 --> 03:10.792
you just try to remember how Realisation has come to you.

03:12.709 --> 03:17.667
When you feel aggressive about something or angry [about] something,

03:17.751 --> 03:23.792
just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering.

03:26.125 --> 03:32.459
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of dissolving yourself.

03:33.209 --> 03:36.792
So the new memories must be built up.

03:36.959 --> 03:40.792
If you start building up new memories,

03:40.918 --> 03:44.375
then you will start collecting moments

03:44.459 --> 03:54.083
to establish other moments which have such memories.

03:55.459 --> 03:59.209
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

03:59.334 --> 04:03.250
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

04:03.918 --> 04:07.292
Now the problem would be when
you will be raising the Kundalini of others,

04:07.417 --> 04:10.584
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there won’t be any thought –

04:10.667 --> 04:14.125
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

04:14.250 --> 04:21.542
But [at] that time you can record the joy of raising the Kundalini.

04:21.792 --> 04:28.584
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini of others,

04:32.083 --> 04:37.918
you will feel [that] a new wealth

04:38.042 --> 04:43.334
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

04:43.459 --> 04:49.709
And all those moments which were giving you confusion

04:49.792 --> 04:55.584
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop out

04:55.709 --> 04:58.584
and pure joy will remain.
