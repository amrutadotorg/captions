00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:12.667
First of all you have to learn how to drive, then you are tested.

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.334
There will be five stones put together,

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:20.792
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through

00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:23.792
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:25.876
And you cannot do it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.042
Why?

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:34.125
That’s how he makes you a master.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.500
The mastery of your attention

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:44.876
will come when you will start seeing 
that it is all a myth that upsets you.

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:48.417
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:51.125
Just throw it away.

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:56.584
Just throw it away and understand

00:00:56.709 --> 00:01:01.667
that you are the eternal attention,

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:07.626
that you are the eternal life,

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:14.125
that [the] only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance,

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:19.125
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.626
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.209
Just drop it! It’s all myth!

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:34.500
You’ll be amazed how your attention will rise

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:39.667
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.250
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.834
will drop out, and you will just smile at it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.667
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself fully

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.000
because your attention

00:01:55.125 --> 00:02:00.459
will be completely drenched into the bliss of Self.

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:07.834
I am saying you will, I say you are

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:13.626
already drenched into that bliss.

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.792
Keep it up.

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:20.792
Now, how to do it?

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:29.375
Actually, in every day-to-day life, 
how to kill the memory of the past?

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:38.500
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories.

00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:44.626
You must remember when you got your first Realisation

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.334
– always think of it.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.834
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.375
you [should] try to think how you got your Realisation.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.500
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating,

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:10.792
you just try to remember how Realisation has come to you.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.667
When you feel aggressive about something or angry [about] something,

00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:23.792
just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering.

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:32.459
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of dissolving yourself.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.792
So the new memories must be built up.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.792
If you start building up new memories,

00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:44.375
then you will start collecting moments

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:54.083
to establish other moments which have such memories.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.209
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:03.250
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:07.292
Now the problem would be when 
you will be raising the Kundalini of others,

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:10.584
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there won’t be any thought –

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.125
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.542
But [at] that time you can record the joy of raising the Kundalini.

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:28.584
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini of others,

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:37.918
you will feel [that] a new wealth

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:43.334
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:49.709
And all those moments which were giving you confusion

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:55.584
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop out

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:58.584
and pure joy will remain.
