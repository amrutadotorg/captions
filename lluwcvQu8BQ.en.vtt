00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:07.329
So I wish you all a very happy Diwali,

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:13.484
and a very prosperous New Year.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.214
The whole evening was so full of joy,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:27.233
peace that I don't know how
to describe

00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:33.886
the whole event was worked out
so beautifully by the French.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.179
Especially people from South Africa,
from Benin,

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:46.194
from Ivory Coast, from Kenya,

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:54.417
and also many others who have come
from various countries,

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:59.353
have shown their talent, their joy,
their happiness.

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:05.114
The best part of it that I've found
them to be very well equipped

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:12.267
with the names of the, all the deities
and how to praise them.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:16.123
Very surprising, in this short time,
how Sahaja Yoga

00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:19.643
has spread to all these countries.

00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:23.995
Regarding the programme,
that was presented

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.936
by the French, is remarkable
I must say.

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:32.455
Last year they had one very good
drama on Jnanadeva;

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.548
and this year the another one was really
very very remarkable.

00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:41.585
Long time back I told them
that Joan of Arc

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.548
was a special, blessed person
by the Divine;

00:01:48.573 --> 00:01:53.374
and she should be worshipped
as a goddess or as a deity,

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.499
which has looked after France
and its independence.

00:01:57.524 --> 00:02:00.672
But then the people, every year
I repeated,

00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:03.120
but they didn't make anything
on her.

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:08.360
So I was very happy to see Joan of Arc
represented here.

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:11.867
Actually in my own life, I have seen,
at a very young age

00:02:11.892 --> 00:02:14.340
of fourteen years and eighteen
years,

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:19.348
I was fighting for the independence
of our country.

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:28.238
And my professor, my principal
of the college, told me later on

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:32.077
that "I knew that you are the Shakti,
because how could you,

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:35.128
all alone, fight these people?"

00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:41.145
So all this aggressiveness is quite
now visible,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.281
and people can see how they have
been aggressed.

00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:49.448
Now the French aggressed these people,
these countries.

00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:54.987
Because of their aggression also
they have been

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:57.943
able to come to Sahaja Yoga,
in a way,

00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:01.024
because then the French took
interest in these people,

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.866
and now, they are, some of them are
Muslims, and of different religions

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:11.780
and they have taken to Sahaja Yoga; it's
a very very remarkable thing to happen.

00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:15.361
They are full of rhythm; rhythm
is in their body.

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:18.646
God has given everybody
something.

00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.859
Now, if some people have got
a fair skin,

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:26.468
I don't think God thinks much
about that.

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:30.060
But if the people have a dark skin,
see their rhythm,

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:35.867
the sense of rhythm, and the way
they were dancing to the tune.

00:03:35.892 --> 00:03:41.481
Not only, but with what speed they were
dancing. I must congratulate you all

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:45.193
for making such a nice play out
of Joan of Arc;

00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:48.880
and all the actors, especially the lady
who acted

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:52.640
as Joan of Arc, was remarkably
good.

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:57.080
I really must say that I never expected
sahaja yogis

00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:00.604
to come out with such a nice drama
on Joan of Arc.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.121
Practically, she was forgotten, because
lastly she was burned.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:19.088
And so many asked me, "If she was the
blessed one and looked by the goddess,

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:24.064
then why was she burned?"
Why was she destroyed?”.

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:29.487
So all of them had to face, all the saints
had to face all the negativity,

00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:35.408
and even if they died, doesn't matter,
they are eternal.

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:38.650
So it's not a very sad thing

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:44.309
to think that all the people who are
saintly have to suffer.

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:48.358
They can suffer because they can
afford to suffer;

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:56.768
they have a power to suffer. And that's
why everybody who is a saint

00:04:56.793 --> 00:05:00.991
is itself, in itself, is so rewarding
to the whole world;

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:06.288
you all have become Sahaja Yogis now.
Whether you are from South Africa

00:05:06.313 --> 00:05:10.336
or from France or from England,
from anywhere.

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:16.582
So there should be no idea
of domination on anyone,

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:19.036
or taking charge of anything.

00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:23.123
Once you understand that you are
all brothers and sisters;

00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:27.325
and that you are under one flag
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.924
you should have no idea of becoming
individualistic

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.666
or trying to show that you are something
better than the others.

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:43.927
To my eye, to my own vision, you are
all just the same.

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:48.763
Whether you are well educated or not,
if you are not educated,

00:05:48.788 --> 00:05:53.374
whether you are dark or you are white
or whatever you may be the colour,

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.586
to my eyes you are just the same.
Look at the Mother Earth,

00:05:56.611 --> 00:06:00.905
as you have seen, anybody who wants
to see the Mother Earth can learn

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.233
that she doesn't differentiate.
She looks after everyone

00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:10.400
with the same love and affection.
So I think,

00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:15.562
if there is even a little in your minds
left out of these

00:06:15.587 --> 00:06:20.822
dominating areas and dominating nature
that you had,

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:26.358
please try to get rid of it and see to it
that you become a humble person.

00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:30.368
Without humility, you cannot achieve
divine heights,

00:06:30.393 --> 00:06:34.410
it's very important to be humble.
And at the right time

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:39.167
then you will be surprised that
all this humility is paid for.

00:06:39.192 --> 00:06:42.512
So tomorrow we are going
to have the puja.

00:06:42.537 --> 00:06:45.708
It's a very good puja of Shri Laxmi,
that will be.

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:48.614
I was thinking because it's quite
a warm place,

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.929
we can have it about six o'clock tomorrow.
And I hope you all will come

00:06:53.954 --> 00:06:57.965
and attend the puja and get the blessings
of Shri Laxmi.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.326
It's very necessary, I must tell you,
that I allow you all

00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:06.099
to have these pujas of all these
deities,

00:07:06.124 --> 00:07:09.293
but you must know it’s a very
sensitive area,

00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:13.047
where you have to be auspicious,
you have to be sensible.

00:07:13.072 --> 00:07:16.128
You cannot just come to puja

00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:19.386
without understanding the significance
of the whole thing.

00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:23.415
Now for this Laxmi puja also,
there's a warning.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.183
If you are coming with a closed
mind

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:36.131
or with a heart which is closed,
which has no generosity in it,

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:42.031
and which has all funny ideas in the
head; all such people won't be blessed.

00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:43.854
On the contrary, they will get

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:47.463
a kind of the other side of the Laxmi
called as A-laxmi.

00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:50.172
And that's why one has to be
very careful

00:07:50.197 --> 00:07:54.250
that when you come tomorrow for puja,
come with an open heart,

00:07:54.275 --> 00:07:58.930
with a love in your heart and
there is proper reception

00:07:58.955 --> 00:08:03.242
of the Laxmi's blessings.
May God bless you all.

00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:06.102
Thank you very much for the nice
entertainment

00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:09.550
and for bringing out all the talents
of the world.

00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:14.866
I must say I'm sorry for the Portuguese
because I was going to Portugal,

00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:19.244
and I just couldn't do it because
of my bad health.

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:23.432
I don't think I have a bad health,
but whatever it is.

00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:25.815
I just couldn't do it this time,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.053
but next year I'm sure we'll be able
to manage.

00:08:29.078 --> 00:08:33.652
May God bless you. Thank you
very much, thank you.
