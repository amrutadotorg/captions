00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:14.117
This felicitation function is little embarrassing for Me

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:26.033
because I was born as a very simple person

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:35.075
and I have been an extremely simple person. I don't understand money.

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:45.492
I don't understand hatred. I don't understand greed. I'm so simple about it.

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:51.575
Despite that, you people came and got your Realization.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:59.825
It's your own achievement. It's your own desires that you have achieved.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:08.534
I find so many children nowadays born as realized souls.

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:12.534
So I think the time is also there,

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:21.700
that at My life, in My life itself, this was to happen.

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.825
It is everybody's lot.

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:33.825
I think, like Shri Rama, then came Shri Krishna, then came Jesus, then other people.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:41.700
It was their time. And My time it is to give you all Realization.

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:49.200
But, I must say, you all have taken it very heartily,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:55.367
sweetly, and are using your powers

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.991
to give love to others and to transform others.

00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:08.534
The other day, I was talking about love. Now the love, as it is understood,

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:13.950
is in your heart as this, but do you know the ocean of love

00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:19.409
is your Sahasrara.  When your Sahasrara is filled with love,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:28.200
then the life is changed. You don't become a very intelligent man,

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:37.409
very dynamic personality,but you are nothing but love

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.450
and this love is so self-satisfying.

00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:49.659
You are not bothered if others don't love you or they love you. You don't see to that part.

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:55.200
What you see is the enjoyment from that love.

00:02:55.242 --> 00:03:00.991
It's a tremendous ocean of love. You all have got it.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:09.908
And once you have entered into Sahaja Yoga, you know that you have entered into Sahasrara

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:19.617
and Sahasrara is the, I tell you, the source of all the truth.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.409
Truth is there, the complete truth.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.200
Truth is the knowledge and also the truth is love.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.033
If you love somebody, you know the truths about that person.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:48.699
You find out whether the person is good or bad or anything. It's very difficult.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.783
But if you love that person, then immediately know what's wrong with that person,

00:03:56.825 --> 00:04:01.534
what's right from that person. But because of your love,

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:08.991
you encompass the whole atmosphere between you and him

00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:11.534
or between you and others.

00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:17.741
You don't see the bad points easily, very difficult.

00:04:17.783 --> 00:04:22.534
I've been many a times, people say, cheated by others. Agreed,

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:32.866
but I have no sense of what cheating means, how people cheat you.

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:35.908
Many a times, people say that they are talking ill about Me.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.866
Yes, they are. I can see they are talking, doesn't matter.

00:04:40.908 --> 00:04:46.242
Makes no difference to Me. If they're taking ill of Me, it's all right.

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:50.699
But this felicitation embarrasses Me definitely

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.741
because I've not done anything so extraordinary, as they think.

00:04:56.783 --> 00:05:02.741
Extraordinary is that whatever capacity you have,

00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:08.075
if it acts, then it is there, like love.

00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:14.617
I have tremendous love, I don't know what to say. And it acts. It works.

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.699
And every human being cares for love.

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.117
You may be very great, you might be very intelligent,

00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:28.158
you may be earning lots of money, whatever it is. It's not so important.

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:35.575
What is the most important thing is that you are loved.

00:05:35.617 --> 00:05:41.825
This is, I have not made a theory out of it or I am not going to say that you all should learn it,

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:48.242
but it's so basic and that's the only thing that helps.

00:05:48.283 --> 00:05:56.699
So residing in the Sahasrara, if you see the waves of love flowing,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.200
maybe some people might take advantage of it, it doesn't matter,

00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:08.367
makes no difference. Some people can also mislead you.

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.492
It's all right. All kinds of things they do;

00:06:12.534 --> 00:06:20.242
but when there is love, you see, you are satisfied, you are not bothered,

00:06:20.283 --> 00:06:22.950
because you love everyone.

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:30.908
So you are satisfied. You are not bothered as to what others, they are doing to you,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.200
what advantage they're taking of you, what they are troubling you

00:06:35.242 --> 00:06:39.492
or all these also felicitations, how they have done,

00:06:39.534 --> 00:06:44.950
also all the facilities that you have from your own being,

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.117
are automatic.

00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:52.534
This felicitations and all that, of course, reflects you, no doubt,

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:55.367
but to Me, it is nothing great.

00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:59.367
I don't think it is a very great achievement for Me

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:04.575
because I have no vision, as such, I must tell you. I've heard this word,

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:07.283
that Mother has a vision. No, no, no, no,

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:09.283
I have no vision, I must tell you.

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:14.283
My simple thing is that everybody must love,

00:07:14.283 --> 00:07:19.283
and a pure love will change your lives,

00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:23.409
it will change the whole world, no doubt about it.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.033
It should come to you natural

00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:31.367
because now you have pierced through your Sahasrara.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:39.950
So for every Sahaja Yogi, love should be very, very natural thing, absolutely.

00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:46.033
For example, I know sometimes people are very rude.

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:49.699
They have certain rules and regulations

00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:57.033
and then they get very angry with the other people or whatever it is.

00:07:57.075 --> 00:08:01.325
Some people have positions and they use their position to get angry with others

00:08:01.325 --> 00:08:06.699
and even to get after that person and torture another person,

00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:13.950
they do, go on doing like this. But they have missed the point. They have missed the point.

00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:23.075
If you just have love, that pure love, then you see the point.

00:08:23.117 --> 00:08:29.866
You see it, that 'Yes, yes, that's what he is doing, that's why he's — .'

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:34.950
You know that. But you are not bothered, 'Why he is doing like me,'

00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:39.158
why is he troubling you and gradually, everything nullifies.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.741
Everything finishes off by itself.

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:48.825
I've seen many people who are talking ill about Me,

00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:53.200
doing all kinds of things against Me. So what? Let them do.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.617
That's their job. Let them do; but to Me, it doesn't disturb, you know.

00:08:58.617 --> 00:09:03.075
I think they are indulging into something of their own style,

00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:09.783
but what do you get? Joy comes only out of pure love.

00:09:09.825 --> 00:09:14.117
If you have no pure love, you cannot have joy.

00:09:14.158 --> 00:09:18.075
Talking that we are very joyous and all that,

00:09:18.117 --> 00:09:22.283
I know who are joyous really and who are not.

00:09:22.325 --> 00:09:27.158
You cannot artificially say that 'I am joyous.'

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:34.575
It should be some sort of an innate, spontaneous feeling within.

00:09:34.617 --> 00:09:42.409
So you are the ocean of feelings, ocean of beautiful feelings.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:51.033
And when you are enriched by that ocean, you are least bothered about anything.

00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:54.699
You know very well that I am very bad at money.

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:58.908
I don't understand. I cannot count money. So what?

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.575
I mean, that's My handicap, I should say,

00:10:02.617 --> 00:10:06.991
but it doesn't matter. What is so needed is

00:10:07.033 --> 00:10:17.783
'Can you feel the love of others? Can you feel the sweetness of others?'

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:20.741
As you see a little child, how nice you feel.

00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:25.741
In the same way, 'Do you feel that for others?'

00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:33.617
or 'Are they like children? Are they innocent like children?'

00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:40.825
And the now, I would suggest that innocence is the sign of love.

00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:48.659
Anybody who has innocence would know the technique of love.

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:54.242
If you are very clever, intelligent, you can answer back,

00:10:54.283 --> 00:11:02.783
you can correct people, do that. No. That's not the way. If you have love,

00:11:02.825 --> 00:11:07.700
you can correct people without saying anything to them,

00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:12.825
because love is a supreme intelligence.

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:20.492
It gives you all the correct method. It works out that.

00:11:20.534 --> 00:11:25.409
The whole thing works out that and then people say,

00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:27.492
'Mother, it's a miracle how it has happened.'

00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:31.866
No, no, it's no miracle.It's simple thing that love

00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:35.866
has acted in its own way. Love is not a dead thing.

00:11:35.908 --> 00:11:41.825
It's not a dead sea. It not only thinks, but it acts

00:11:41.866 --> 00:11:45.741
and acts so beautifully.

00:11:45.783 --> 00:11:49.492
Sometimes I'm amazed at its working.

00:11:49.492 --> 00:11:53.699
We call it a miracle, this, that. Nothing — it's love.

00:11:53.699 --> 00:12:00.575
Now, because the Divine loves you, it gives you miracles, so called.

00:12:00.617 --> 00:12:03.075
It can do anything

00:12:03.117 --> 00:12:08.242
because the Divine wants that you should get to Sahaja Yoga

00:12:08.242 --> 00:12:11.200
and you should become a real yogi.

00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:17.659
So whatever this love does, you think it's miracle.

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:22.534
It is not. Why people say, 'Mother, that's your style.'

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.450
It's not question. It's a question of love.

00:12:25.492 --> 00:12:31.575
Say, I love everyone very much, I trust everyone very much.

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:38.950
I never doubt, to begin with, and they are sinking, sinking,

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:43.409
but still I have faith that they'll come round, that they'll be all right.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:48.699
Give them a chance. But supposing they try some tricks,

00:12:48.741 --> 00:12:52.075
you'll be amazed how they get exposed.

00:12:52.117 --> 00:12:56.825
How they get exposed, it's very surprising.

00:12:56.866 --> 00:13:02.617
We have a Sahaja Yogi in Dubai. He told Me,

00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:05.908
'Mother, no use giving Realization to these big people.'

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.575
I say, 'Why?' So he gave Me the name of very highly

00:13:10.617 --> 00:13:14.575
spiritual people accepted by society.

00:13:14.617 --> 00:13:17.825
'I gave him Realization and he got exposed.

00:13:17.866 --> 00:13:21.866
I don't know, I never said anything — got exposed.'

00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:28.283
Another person whom he gave Realization, also had a very big thing,

00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:35.117
having lots of awards and this and that, he got exposed.

00:13:35.158 --> 00:13:42.866
And he gave Realization to one fellow who had peace award.

00:13:42.908 --> 00:13:53.283
He also got exposed. And then it was in the newspaper all about him.

00:13:53.325 --> 00:14:00.866
Now what is happening is that this man, out of love for the other one, gives them Realization,

00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:07.158
but that same love acts in such a manner that he gets exposed.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.075
You don't want to expose people.

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:14.659
You want that somehow they'll come to Sahaja Yoga all right, it's all right working out.

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:19.866
So he said, 'Mother, I don't think I'll give Realization to anyone.'

00:14:19.908 --> 00:14:24.492
I said, 'See, you go on giving.

00:14:24.534 --> 00:14:29.575
If the Divine wants that the person should be exposed, he will be exposed.'

00:14:29.617 --> 00:14:35.033
If there is anything wrong with that person, he'll be exposed.

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:39.200
Somebody who gets Realization, supposing,

00:14:39.242 --> 00:14:44.991
and he meets with an accident, of course he'll be saved,

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:49.699
but he might meet with an accident.

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:53.783
So what is the reason why? Why did he meet with the accident?

00:14:53.825 --> 00:15:02.450
Because he doesn't do anything for Sahaja Yoga. He's very ambitious.

00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:11.492
Somebody who's very sick, he's all right with Sahaja Yoga

00:15:11.534 --> 00:15:17.659
and somebody who's not that sick, gets much worse. It's a fact.

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:23.367
Though he's protected — that's one thing about Sahaj Yoga,

00:15:23.409 --> 00:15:28.033
you may be the worst Sahaja Yoga, you are protected, no doubt, but if you go on like that,

00:15:28.075 --> 00:15:37.617
if you all the time trying to go against Sahaja

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:43.409
and become asahaj, then you suffer very badly.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:50.242
It's very simple that if you are standing in a place, you are established in a place,

00:15:50.283 --> 00:16:02.950
which is very peaceful, very joy-giving, but you want to get out of it,

00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:08.699
so you face whatever is outside, it's automatic.

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:19.242
If you stand in the place which is so peaceful, which is joyous, which is full of love,

00:16:19.242 --> 00:16:24.117
you are all right, you'll grow in spirituality.

00:16:24.158 --> 00:16:28.783
But if you want to get out of it, then you have it.

00:16:28.825 --> 00:16:39.659
You can't help it. It's like a fortress or we can call a very secluded place,

00:16:39.659 --> 00:16:50.409
which very comfort and very much full of attention and all that

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:56.283
and then you want to go out of the attention. So, you're gone.

00:16:56.325 --> 00:17:00.908
That's how some Sahaja Yogis don't understand

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.492
why they are not yet getting into Sahaj Yoga.

00:17:04.534 --> 00:17:13.409
So no use using your intelligence because this intelligence, human intelligence,

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.866
is not a very high quality function.

00:17:16.908 --> 00:17:23.242
What is best is to fall in love with your Self

00:17:23.283 --> 00:17:36.950
love which is divine, love which is nourishing, love that looks after you.

00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:40.783
But we don't know how to look after ourselves.

00:17:40.825 --> 00:17:46.325
We don't know how to love ourselves. We love this person, love that person,

00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:53.242
but what about yourself? Then they think it is selfishness — no, not at all.

00:17:53.242 --> 00:18:02.158
To know the Self is love. If you know the Self, you'll know love,

00:18:02.158 --> 00:18:05.117
you'll fall into the ocean of that love.

00:18:05.158 --> 00:18:08.783
But that is what is My experience, I'm telling,

00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:11.783
and you all should experience the same love.

00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:14.950
Just watch yourself.

00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:24.283
It's very simple to introspect, 'Do I have love within me, fully?'

00:18:24.325 --> 00:18:28.575
Partly it is love, partly no.

00:18:28.617 --> 00:18:32.450
Now love can be very much bounded

00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:36.866
also like 'we love our country', say India.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:40.699
If we love our country, so we may think

00:18:40.699 --> 00:18:42.575
all Indian things are good.

00:18:42.617 --> 00:18:45.117
We'll never talk ill about our country.

00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:50.699
Anybody says anything about India, against, we'll hate that person.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:19:01.866
It's with everyone. You love your country. Also you love, say,

00:19:01.908 --> 00:19:07.617
your parents, love anybody. But is a limited love.

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:13.242
It's a bounded love. Love should be just opened.

00:19:13.283 --> 00:19:19.534
Then you will see where do you stand as far as your country's concerned,

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:25.659
as far as your relationships are concerned. You will know everything.

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:30.783
You need not harm, you need not say anything, you need not quarrel, fight,

00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:35.075
but you will know -- because love gives you knowledge,

00:19:35.117 --> 00:19:39.409
complete knowledge about the person.

00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:44.700
You know the person, what he's up to, what he's doing,

00:19:44.741 --> 00:19:50.741
but you don't mind because you love that person.

00:19:50.783 --> 00:19:53.825
So you don't mind. 'All right, so ahead.'

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:57.617
It's like a little child. It's going on the wrong way. Let it go.

00:19:57.617 --> 00:20:02.242
Now with all these things, whatever you wear,

00:20:02.283 --> 00:20:07.409
you are very lucky people who have reached Sahasrara

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:12.908
and that you all know everything about Sahaj Yoga.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:19.617
But without practising Sahaja Yoga, you cannot work it out

00:20:19.617 --> 00:20:24.450
because then, by practising it, you know about your Self.

00:20:24.492 --> 00:20:31.950
When you meditate, you know your Self and then you get just filled with love.

00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:37.033
But now, while sitting, you just start thinking,

00:20:37.033 --> 00:20:42.950
'He's a very bad man. I hate him' — this thing. All such stupid ideas come into your head,

00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:48.699
or 'I must buy this ornament' or 'I must buy this particular car'

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.699
and all that, then you are not loving.

00:20:53.741 --> 00:21:02.283
But if you love, then what happens is that whatever you need, you get.

00:21:02.325 --> 00:21:05.283
Whatever you want, you get.

00:21:05.283 --> 00:21:09.283
You have to first love yourself,

00:21:09.283 --> 00:21:18.200
but that love should be pure love. As a result of that, you'll cleanse yourself.

00:21:18.242 --> 00:21:23.908
Sometimes you are so much identified with your temperaments,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.699
with your nature, with you personality, whatever it is,

00:21:27.699 --> 00:21:30.950
but then you realize, in that love,

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.242
that 'This is not love. This is blind.'

00:21:34.283 --> 00:21:39.659
Love gives you a complete idea about yourself.

00:21:39.659 --> 00:21:46.991
'What am I? What problems I have?

00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:53.492
Why do I create problems?  Why do I get into problems?'

00:21:53.534 --> 00:22:00.700
You'll be amazed that love has such a powerful light in it,

00:22:00.741 --> 00:22:07.033
that it is the truth and it is the knowledge.

00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:12.450
Though I don't know if I am to blame anyone in this world

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:20.075
who are not a realized soul, I will not -- and a fully realized soul, I will not --

00:22:20.117 --> 00:22:27.325
because there is no light in their life.They can't see themselves

00:22:27.367 --> 00:22:31.492
and they can't see others. So what's the use of blaming them,

00:22:31.492 --> 00:22:37.783
blaming this community, that community or this country or that country? What is the use?

00:22:37.783 --> 00:22:50.950
And this love is universal. It has nothing to do with any particular type

00:22:50.991 --> 00:22:55.033
or particular style. It's universal.

00:22:55.075 --> 00:22:58.700
That is why Sahaja Yoga is universal.

00:22:58.741 --> 00:23:05.242
It is spreading everywhere. I want you to enjoy that love.

00:23:05.242 --> 00:23:10.950
Only example I'll give you, a grandmother and a grandchild.

00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:18.534
They have a relationship — at least in India, I know. of tremendous love.

00:23:18.534 --> 00:23:26.075
For them, the grandchild is everything and the grandmother is everything.

00:23:26.075 --> 00:23:31.825
They just love each other. Whatever the grandchild may do,

00:23:31.866 --> 00:23:34.699
whatever the grandmother may do, it's all right.

00:23:34.699 --> 00:23:40.075
It's a kind of a tremendous experience of elivage (elevation).

00:23:40.075 --> 00:23:46.492
You feel elevated and you enjoy that love.

00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:51.950
If there is no purity in love, you can never, never enjoy love.

00:23:51.991 --> 00:23:59.659
So I would request you to find out that ocean in your head

00:23:59.699 --> 00:24:05.950
in the Sahasrara, which is being filled by your heart.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:14.991
Do you know Heart and Sahasrara are very much in relationship with each other?

00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:25.450
Their style is such that if somebody's head is not all right, the heart won't be all right.

00:24:25.492 --> 00:24:29.492
If the heart is not all right, his head won't be all right.

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:33.617
But is more reflection from the head to the heart.

00:24:33.617 --> 00:24:40.700
They say that thereґs genes are bad or this, nothing of the kind.

00:24:40.741 --> 00:24:45.242
After Sahaja Yoga, your genes are changed

00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:55.450
you are changed; everything is changed now. So your brain is filled with nothing but light.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:02.534
Your heart is filled with light and you are just

00:25:02.575 --> 00:25:06.866
bouncing with love, all the time with humour,

00:25:06.908 --> 00:25:11.699
with loving care. Every day, I mean, it's so different.

00:25:11.699 --> 00:25:21.158
But that you have achieved now. Now you have got it. So just enjoy that.

00:25:21.158 --> 00:25:29.659
Then the caste system and the fundamentalism, that, the greed and jealousies

00:25:29.699 --> 00:25:35.534
and competition an all, they all drop, useless things.

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:43.409
But if you have the jungle of nonsense in your mind,

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:47.492
then all kinds of animals can creep in.

00:25:47.534 --> 00:25:55.908
To purify yourself with love, cleanse yourself with love.

00:25:55.908 --> 00:26:05.409
Look at every position, everything, with love and you will be amazed how you will find it easier

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:10.617
not to dominate, not control, not to despise,

00:26:10.617 --> 00:26:18.908
not to say things which are not(?) wrong. It's such a correcting thing, love is,

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:28.575
extremely correcting and extremely joy-giving that you will be amazed at yourself,

00:26:28.575 --> 00:26:30.783
how you are managing things.

00:26:30.783 --> 00:26:35.825
I knew of many like that.

00:26:35.866 --> 00:26:42.783
There was a Sahaja Yogi who never used to talk to his own uncle, never.

00:26:42.783 --> 00:26:51.033
And he said, 'Somehow, I hate him.' 'But why?' 'I don't know why, I hate him.'

00:26:51.075 --> 00:26:59.783
And then he went to a race course and there he saw his uncle coming.

00:26:59.783 --> 00:27:02.617
He rushed and he just hugged him.

00:27:02.617 --> 00:27:09.699
Uncle started looking, 'Now what does he want? Why is he doing? What is it?' in his mind.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:15.575
'Why is he wanting to love me like this?' He couldn't understand.

00:27:15.617 --> 00:27:26.659
When it happened, you know, that he couldn't explain that he'd become a Sahaja Yogi or anything.

00:27:26.659 --> 00:27:31.699
So the uncle asked, 'What do you want now?' He said,

00:27:31.699 --> 00:27:34.325
'Nothing. I love you, that's all.'

00:27:34.325 --> 00:27:45.033
It's such a nice thing to do it. It's such a nice thing to say.

00:27:45.075 --> 00:27:54.158
There should be no greed in it, no -- any plan behind it,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:01.534
just it's a feeling of an ocean which touches every shore

00:28:01.575 --> 00:28:08.367
and there it makes a sound, beautiful sound of love.

00:28:08.409 --> 00:28:19.492
And then the waves return back. Continuously it is flowing and continuously it is working out, never tired.

00:28:19.492 --> 00:28:25.866
I know in the Kali Yuga, to be born and to do this work

00:28:25.908 --> 00:28:30.991
is a very difficult task, but, to Me, it was not.

00:28:31.033 --> 00:28:33.200
Whatever happened,

00:28:33.242 --> 00:28:36.450
whatever people troubled Me, howsoever,

00:28:36.492 --> 00:28:47.283
I was working it out, out of this flow of love. Went round every place,

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:50.741
wherever is possible, whenever it is possible,

00:28:50.741 --> 00:28:54.158
whatever may be My health or anything,

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.741
I was least bothered and I have enjoyed all of you very much. I have enjoyed.

00:28:59.783 --> 00:29:03.617
There have been one or two horrible people -- doesn't matter.

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:10.075
So when you have — saying all these things about Me, only tears come into My eyes.

00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:16.741
I don't know what else to say. I mean, it is something I would like you to do,

00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:21.908
you to get it, this kind of life where you just flow with your love.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.534
May God bless you very much.
