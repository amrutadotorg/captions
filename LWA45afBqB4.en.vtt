00:09.918 --> 00:13.709
So I have to tell you, that you might be
the highest of highest,

00:13.918 --> 00:18.292
first thing [that] you have to give Me today
is that in your talk,

00:18.375 --> 00:24.876
in your behaviour, in your heart,
you will reside one with Love.

00:25.083 --> 00:29.500
And the second thing I want to ask is
that you should be peaceful people.

00:29.709 --> 00:33.209
Try to have peace with yourself.
Don’t fight with yourself.

00:33.959 --> 00:36.709
That peace should not be lost at any cost,

00:36.834 --> 00:41.292
and should not be also expressed outside
in a way, like I sometimes.

00:41.375 --> 00:45.167
My peace itself becomes terrible.

00:45.375 --> 00:48.999
But you don’t have that kind of a possibility,
so you just don’t do it.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.834
You just don’t do it, never do it that way.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.584
Try to be extremely peaceful,
try to make your forehead relaxed.

00:57.709 --> 01:02.125
Try to trust yourself, open your Agnya,
open your Ekadasha

01:02.334 --> 01:08.083
and your Sahasrara, and your heart will open.
Once your Sahasrara is open,

01:08.292 --> 01:12.334
your heart will open automatically,
so you will have a peaceful life.

01:12.542 --> 01:15.292
So today I am asking for two things from you.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.709
It's a funny thing that a Mother
has to ask for a gift.

01:18.918 --> 01:23.250
And the gift you have to give - first one -
is that you should be peaceful people.

01:23.459 --> 01:28.459
You should express peacefulness through
your own character, talking.

01:31.751 --> 01:37.751
Let everybody live peacefully within themselves
and give peace to others,

01:37.959 --> 01:44.792
so that this peace will become a nucleus
for the peace of the world.

01:44.999 --> 01:55.334
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.999
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

01:59.167 --> 02:02.959
You are sitting in complete peace
and happiness and joy,

02:03.125 --> 02:07.876
you don't know, you are emitting all that peace,
channelizing it and doing it.

02:07.959 --> 02:12.292
Now for us today to decide first of all
in our hearts

02:12.500 --> 02:15.375
that we’ll take to peaceful methods.

02:15.584 --> 02:19.375
When we are travelling, we’ll be taking
to peaceful methods.

02:19.584 --> 02:24.626
Anybody who is trying to provoke you
or trying to create a problem

02:24.834 --> 02:32.125
or divide you on any issue whatsoever,
run away from that person as fast as possible.

02:32.334 --> 02:38.999
Anybody who talks of peace, the peace-makers,
stick on to that person,

02:39.459 --> 02:44.999
then only you will understand
that you are also getting peace.

02:46.334 --> 02:52.292
Here you have come to get peace,
not to create problems,

02:52.500 --> 02:57.918
or to listen to your problems,
but to get to peace.

02:58.083 --> 03:07.334
Peace is a nature or is the quality of your Spirit.

03:07.542 --> 03:12.667
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

03:12.876 --> 03:20.709
what happens that you go beyond
the cause and the effect.

03:20.918 --> 03:23.667
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

03:23.876 --> 03:28.709
So the cause disappears
and the effect also disappears.

03:28.918 --> 03:35.417
So today we all have come here to worship
the peace, the within and the without.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.292
Let is be peaceful.

03:40.209 --> 03:47.500
So you have your love, which is pure,
without any lust or greed.

03:47.667 --> 03:53.792
You love others only because you are in love.

03:54.500 --> 03:59.584
And then, secondly, you are blessed with peace,

03:59.751 --> 04:03.834
you are absolutely at peace with yourself.

04:03.999 --> 04:07.792
And you will be amazed, with peace,
wisdom will come to you.

04:08.167 --> 04:12.584
You will be regarded as the
wisest man, wisest woman,

04:12.709 --> 04:15.375
because you are at peace with yourself.

04:15.584 --> 04:20.209
Only in peace you can discover the Truth,

04:20.375 --> 04:24.667
you can discover every solution
that you want to.

04:25.584 --> 04:33.375
You become  very wise and sensible person,
outstandingly great than others.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.542
You are not like common, general, people.

04:39.834 --> 04:43.626
When we say it’s a Vishwa Dharma,

04:43.709 --> 04:49.417
it’s a Universal Religion we belong to,

04:49.542 --> 04:57.918
first and foremost thing, the essence of that,
is peace.

04:58.250 --> 05:05.250
The peace has to be within, to begin with.
You have to be peaceful within yourself.

05:08.083 --> 05:15.083
If you are not peaceful, if you are playing
tricks with your ego,

05:17.626 --> 05:25.999
if you are just satisfying yourself saying
that you are peaceful, you are sadly mistaken.

05:26.083 --> 05:32.834
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself.

05:32.918 --> 05:35.626
It is to be felt within yourself.

05:35.709 --> 05:42.000
So do not give wrong satisfactions to yourself,

05:42.083 --> 05:47.792
do not give false notions to yourself.
Don’t cheat yourself.

05:49.834 --> 05:52.918
Peace has to be felt within yourself,

05:52.999 --> 05:56.250
and if you are not feeling that,
you shouldn’t come and ask me,

05:56.334 --> 05:58.334
“Mother, why I am not feeling it.”

05:58.417 --> 06:04.000
Because I am not going to tell you
that something [is] wrong with you.

06:04.083 --> 06:12.584
You have to work it out that you should feel
peaceful within yourself.

06:12.667 --> 06:20.999
It is not that if you have too much of silence outside,
you feel peaceful.

06:21.042 --> 06:25.834
The peace has to be within yourself.

06:25.918 --> 06:29.959
You have it. Your Spirit is absolutely peaceful

06:30.000 --> 06:36.834
Avyagra, without restlessness.
There is no restlessness in your Spirit.

06:36.918 --> 06:41.000
Absolutely peaceful and steady.

06:42.375 --> 06:46.667
It is for you to feel it. It is not
for anybody else to certify you.

06:46.751 --> 06:48.292
This is one thing.

06:48.375 --> 06:52.125
Secondly, when I am telling you something,
you think I am not telling you.

06:52.209 --> 06:53.959
It doesn’t register in your brain.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.959
You think I am telling it to X, Y, Z
but not to you. You are not in it.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.792
That’s another sign [that] there is no peace.

07:01.876 --> 07:05.834
Because there is no peace,
there is no registration.

07:05.918 --> 07:12.083
Whatever goes into your head,
that is going to work out.

07:12.167 --> 07:19.792
But what I find [is] that people
[who] have concave personalities,

07:19.876 --> 07:21.709
then they receive it.

07:21.792 --> 07:28.584
Those who have convex personalities,
do not register anything .

07:28.667 --> 07:33.250
The registration is so poor that, whatever I say

07:33.334 --> 07:36.959
doesn’t have any effect on them.
Otherwise, whatever I say is a mantra.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.083
It should have direct effect on you,

07:39.167 --> 07:46.250
and you should feel that effect,
that penetration within you.

07:46.334 --> 07:54.626
But as if it is for somebody else,
as if it is not for you.

07:59.918 --> 08:05.042
This shows there is no peace within you.

08:05.125 --> 08:14.959
Only the peace within can register
whatever is auspicious,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.083
whatever is nourishing for your growth.

08:20.292 --> 08:26.167
So try to make peace with yourself.
Do not fight with yourself,

08:26.834 --> 08:30.083
“Why should I do it?”, “I am so bad!”,
“I should not have done it!”.

08:30.167 --> 08:33.667
All these we should not do.

08:33.709 --> 08:37.751
Try not to fight with yourself, first of all.

08:37.834 --> 08:41.709
Then you fight with me, “Why am I like this?
Why should it be like this with me?

08:41.792 --> 08:43.834
Why is it I catch? Why. . . .?.”

08:43.918 --> 08:46.584
How am I to answer such a question?
It is very aggressive.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.982
I think it is very aggressive attitude
of many Sahaja Yogis

08:50.062 --> 08:52.224
to come and ask me such a question, “Why…?”

08:52.304 --> 08:59.584
Because I can’t tell you what is wrong
with you because it is not in my culture.

08:59.667 --> 09:04.250
You should find yourself what is wrong with you.

09:04.292 --> 09:10.876
But it’s not “what’s wrong with you” is the problem.
What is right with you is the attitude.

09:10.959 --> 09:16.042
Whatever is right with you, put your foot on that,

09:16.125 --> 09:23.876
establish yourself on that point.
And then develop yourself higher.

09:23.959 --> 09:33.751
Peace is the keynote, as I said,
for universal growth of this Religion.

09:38.083 --> 09:43.250
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy, happiness.

09:43.459 --> 09:48.792
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

09:48.999 --> 09:53.209
to understand to give up all the strives,

09:53.417 --> 09:59.999
all the false battles, for money and for power,

10:00.792 --> 10:06.083
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

10:06.292 --> 10:11.834
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

10:12.000 --> 10:16.709
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

10:17.500 --> 10:22.459
where they are invited with all respect and love.

10:22.667 --> 10:26.584
I wish peace to all of them, to all the countries,

10:26.792 --> 10:35.959
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

10:37.876 --> 10:46.459
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

10:46.667 --> 10:56.375
their tongues speak with peace,
their eyes see nothing but peace.

11:00.500 --> 11:05.626
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

11:05.834 --> 11:09.417
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

11:09.626 --> 11:15.083
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly, has to vanish,

11:15.292 --> 11:19.459
and the peace has to prevail, which is not
the peace of the dead

11:19.667 --> 11:25.125
but peace of the living,
that has to come, of the wise.

11:25.834 --> 11:30.000
I bless all of you to be
the channels of that peace,

11:30.209 --> 11:36.542
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

11:36.751 --> 11:43.334
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.209
May God bless you.
