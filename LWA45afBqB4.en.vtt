00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:13.709
So I have to tell you, that you might be 
the highest of highest,

00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:18.292
first thing [that] you have to give Me today 
is that in your talk,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:24.876
in your behaviour, in your heart, 
you will reside one with Love.

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:29.500
And the second thing I want to ask is 
that you should be peaceful people.

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:33.209
Try to have peace with yourself. 
Don’t fight with yourself.

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:36.709
That peace should not be lost at any cost,

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:41.292
and should not be also expressed outside 
in a way, like I sometimes.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:45.167
My peace itself becomes terrible.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:48.999
But you don’t have that kind of a possibility, 
so you just don’t do it.

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:51.834
You just don’t do it, never do it that way.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.584
Try to be extremely peaceful, 
try to make your forehead relaxed.

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:02.125
Try to trust yourself, open your Agnya, 
open your Ekadasha

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:08.083
and your Sahasrara, and your heart will open. 
Once your Sahasrara is open,

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:12.334
your heart will open automatically, 
so you will have a peaceful life.

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:15.292
So today I am asking for two things from you.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.709
It's a funny thing that a Mother
has to ask for a gift.

00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:23.250
And the gift you have to give - first one -
is that you should be peaceful people.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:28.459
You should express peacefulness through
your own character, talking.

00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:37.751
Let everybody live peacefully within themselves
and give peace to others,

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:44.792
so that this peace will become a nucleus
for the peace of the world.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:55.334
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.999
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:02.959
You are sitting in complete peace
and happiness and joy,

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:07.876
you don't know, you are emitting all that peace,
channelizing it and doing it.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.292
Now for us today to decide first of all
in our hearts

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.375
that we’ll take to peaceful methods.

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:19.375
When we are travelling, we’ll be taking
to peaceful methods.

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:24.626
Anybody who is trying to provoke you
or trying to create a problem

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:32.125
or divide you on any issue whatsoever,
run away from that person as fast as possible.

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:38.999
Anybody who talks of peace, the peace-makers,
stick on to that person,

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.999
then only you will understand
that you are also getting peace.

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:52.292
Here you have come to get peace,
not to create problems,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.918
or to listen to your problems,
but to get to peace.

00:02:58.083 --> 00:03:07.334
Peace is a nature or is the quality of your Spirit.

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:12.667
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:20.709
what happens that you go beyond
the cause and the effect.

00:03:20.918 --> 00:03:23.667
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:28.709
So the cause disappears
and the effect also disappears.

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:35.417
So today we all have come here to worship
the peace, the within and the without.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.292
Let is be peaceful.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.500
So you have your love, which is pure,
without any lust or greed.

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:53.792
You love others only because you are in love.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.584
And then, secondly, you are blessed with peace,

00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:03.834
you are absolutely at peace with yourself.

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.792
And you will be amazed, with peace,
wisdom will come to you.

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:12.584
You will be regarded as the
wisest man, wisest woman,

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.375
because you are at peace with yourself.

00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:20.209
Only in peace you can discover the Truth,

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:24.667
you can discover every solution 
that you want to.

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:33.375
You become  very wise and sensible person,
outstandingly great than others.

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:36.542
You are not like common, general, people.

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:43.626
When we say it’s a Vishwa Dharma,

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:49.417
it’s a Universal Religion we belong to,

00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:57.918
first and foremost thing, the essence of that,
is peace.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.250
The peace has to be within, to begin with.
You have to be peaceful within yourself.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:15.083
If you are not peaceful, if you are playing
tricks with your ego,

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:25.999
if you are just satisfying yourself saying
that you are peaceful, you are sadly mistaken.

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:32.834
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself.

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:35.626
It is to be felt within yourself.

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:42.000
So do not give wrong satisfactions to yourself,

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:47.792
do not give false notions to yourself.
Don’t cheat yourself.

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:52.918
Peace has to be felt within yourself,

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.250
and if you are not feeling that,
you shouldn’t come and ask me,

00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:58.334
“Mother, why I am not feeling it.”

00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:04.000
Because I am not going to tell you
that something [is] wrong with you.

00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:12.584
You have to work it out that you should feel
peaceful within yourself.

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:20.999
It is not that if you have too much of silence outside,
you feel peaceful.

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:25.834
The peace has to be within yourself.

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.959
You have it. Your Spirit is absolutely peaceful

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.834
Avyagra, without restlessness.
There is no restlessness in your Spirit.

00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:41.000
Absolutely peaceful and steady.

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:46.667
It is for you to feel it. It is not
for anybody else to certify you.

00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:48.292
This is one thing.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:52.125
Secondly, when I am telling you something,
you think I am not telling you.

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:53.959
It doesn’t register in your brain.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.959
You think I am telling it to X, Y, Z
but not to you. You are not in it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.792
That’s another sign [that] there is no peace.

00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:05.834
Because there is no peace,
there is no registration.

00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:12.083
Whatever goes into your head,
that is going to work out.

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:19.792
But what I find [is] that people
[who] have concave personalities,

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:21.709
then they receive it.

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:28.584
Those who have convex personalities,
do not register anything .

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:33.250
The registration is so poor that, whatever I say

00:07:33.334 --> 00:07:36.959
doesn’t have any effect on them.
Otherwise, whatever I say is a mantra.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.083
It should have direct effect on you,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:46.250
and you should feel that effect,
that penetration within you.

00:07:46.334 --> 00:07:54.626
But as if it is for somebody else,
as if it is not for you.

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:05.042
This shows there is no peace within you.

00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:14.959
Only the peace within can register
whatever is auspicious,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.083
whatever is nourishing for your growth.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:26.167
So try to make peace with yourself.
Do not fight with yourself,

00:08:26.834 --> 00:08:30.083
“Why should I do it?”, “I am so bad!”,
“I should not have done it!”.

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:33.667
All these we should not do.

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:37.751
Try not to fight with yourself, first of all.

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:41.709
Then you fight with me, “Why am I like this?
Why should it be like this with me?

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.834
Why is it I catch? Why. . . .?.”

00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:46.584
How am I to answer such a question?
It is very aggressive.

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:49.982
I think it is very aggressive attitude
of many Sahaja Yogis

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:52.224
to come and ask me such a question, “Why…?”

00:08:52.304 --> 00:08:59.584
Because I can’t tell you what is wrong
with you because it is not in my culture.

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:04.250
You should find yourself what is wrong with you.

00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:10.876
But it’s not “what’s wrong with you” is the problem.
What is right with you is the attitude.

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:16.042
Whatever is right with you, put your foot on that,

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:23.876
establish yourself on that point.
And then develop yourself higher.

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:33.751
Peace is the keynote, as I said,
for universal growth of this Religion.

00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:43.250
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy, happiness.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:48.792
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:53.209
to understand to give up all the strives,

00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:59.999
all the false battles, for money and for power,

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:06.083
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:11.834
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.709
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.459
where they are invited with all respect and love.

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:26.584
I wish peace to all of them, to all the countries,

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:35.959
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:46.459
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:56.375
their tongues speak with peace,
 their eyes see nothing but peace.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.626
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:09.417
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

00:11:09.626 --> 00:11:15.083
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly, has to vanish,

00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:19.459
and the peace has to prevail, which is not
the peace of the dead

00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:25.125
but peace of the living,
that has to come, of the wise.

00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:30.000
I bless all of you to be
the channels of that peace,

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:36.542
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:43.334
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:45.209
May God bless you.
