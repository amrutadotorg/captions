00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:42.630
It was very nice to come to Reading again,
and to meet very nice people like your Mayor

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:50.220
and another nice person who was interviewing
me at the radio station.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:16:01.110
I am discovering new talents in this place
which is really historically very important.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:10.170
But in the history of spirituality, England
as a whole has to play a very, very important

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.580
role, which perhaps English people don’t
realise.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.810
William Blake has said that, that England
has to become Jerusalem.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:25.779
It has to become a Holy land and you all have
to become holy people.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:29.820
He is not a liar, he wouldn’t tell you a
lie.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:36.210
People can say that he was a visionary and
he visualised things beyond his foresight.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:45.320
That’s not a fact, because about Sahaja
Yoga he has written very vividly, clearly,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:53.830
as to where I’ll be staying since my arrival
in England, where our ashram is going to be.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:17:03.830
It is so beautifully done that I feel this
land has something special about it to produce,

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:09.890
or to create, such great poets, such great
seers.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.080
India of course is a country of yoga, no doubt.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:23.360
But there also we had a great poet, about
the same time as Blake, maybe a little earlier,

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360
Gyaneshwara.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.670
He did write about Kundalini.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:34.360
He also described the times of Sahaja Yoga
by saying that: at that time, the people who

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:43.000
are in darkness, the people who are blind,
will see light.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.120
He’s also gone further to say that: those
people who will receive light, will be able

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.109
to enlighten other people.

00:17:55.109 --> 00:18:03.340
But William Blake has very clearly said that
men of God will become prophets, and these

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.550
prophets will have powers to make others prophets.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:18.290
And this is the test that you should put to
everything: “Have I become a prophet?”

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.760
I mean, it’s all right there are many people
who are around, who are selling their things.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.300
I don’t know what they are doing to attract
more people.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:38.240
Like the mayor asked me that, “As your work
is so fantastic, you must have been receiving

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.109
thousands of people!”

00:18:40.109 --> 00:18:43.240
I said, “No I don’t.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.730
Sometimes I receive five or sometimes ten!”

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.779
He was amazed!

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:48.669
He said, “How can that be?”

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.090
I said, “It’s true!

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.920
I receive very few people to come to my programme.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.290
And if they come and stick on for a while,
they get Realisation all right.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.490
But there are very few who come.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.050
He was quite amazed.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.220
He said, “Really?

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.889
But I am surprised, you don’t charge any
money, there’s no membership.

00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:10.669
I mean it really shows that it is something
Divine.

00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:13.830
And still, how is it few people come to you?”

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.160
I said, “I will ask the same question to
you, because I don’t understand human beings!

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:25.580
You better answer me that why so few people
come and take advantage of this Sahaja Yoga

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:33.870
which gives you the power that is lying within
you, which gives you what you have already

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:39.229
existing within you, which is your own, it’s
your own property.

00:19:39.229 --> 00:19:42.720
Still they don’t come, even if you tell
them [that] freely you are going to be given

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.430
all your bank balances, please come, please
come, but they don’t come."

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.820
So I said, “Instead of asking me this question,
for the first time, let me ask you this question.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.040
I can’t understand."

00:19:54.040 --> 00:20:00.489
But in Indian villages it’s a different
thing: where the people come in thousands.

00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:04.800
One of the reasons may be that the people
do not know much about Kundalini, they are

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.160
naïve about that.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:13.590
And they do not know what it means by the
word ‘Self-Realisation’: what it means,

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.370
what is a Self, and what should happen to
us.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:23.720
Perhaps that may be the reason: a sort of
ignorance about it.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:30.370
But despite all that, this word ‘Self-Realisation’
has been used since long by many marketeers,

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.810
and nobody has been able to give it.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:38.299
Now if somebody says, “Yes it can happen
to you, just it can happen."

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:40.490
I think there should be real interest.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:50.350
But still I cannot explain why is it that
few people come, and those who come also do

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.680
not stick on, they have no patience.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.610
“But with other gurus?”

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.050
He asked me.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.360
I said, “No, there are many [that] go: thousands
and thousands."

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:08.140
There’s one fellow whom the British people
have given 58 Rolls Royces, and then they

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.170
gave him a 59th one because he would not come
without getting a Rolls Royce from them.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:18.280
So they starved themselves for one year, and
gave him the 59th Rolls Royce!

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.200
And how many people must have done it?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.980
Fifty-thousand people collected that money
to give it to this fellow to come down here!

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.370
Already now that he has 59th, I think he must
be waiting for the 60th.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:36.630
And I wouldn’t be surprised that they will
be again collecting money for him.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.489
One must understand that you cannot pay for
God.

00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:44.480
You cannot buy God by giving him a Rolls Royce.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.590
He doesn’t understand this Rolls Royce,
He doesn’t understand money, He doesn’t

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.590
understand bank.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.880
He doesn’t know the mint.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:57.970
He doesn’t know that you are having a new
system, of this paper money.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.670
He’s not aware of these things.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:07.090
But somehow we are so much used to these mundane
things, regular things, that we personally,

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:12.880
all of us, feel that if it is going to be
God, He has to be just like us: there should

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.220
be an organisation, there should be a chairman,
there should be a vice-chairman, there has

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.340
to be a secretary, and all this organisation
must be there.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.570
And there only if we go, then it’s all right,
then we are safe, we are secure, because we

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.130
are used to it.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:34.670
But God’s laws and God’s domain is very
different from what we understand.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.310
We have never felt his love.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:43.420
We have been always working, with all our
organised things because we were insecure

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.480
about something.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.280
Every institution is for some kind of an insecurity.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:54.560
Because we are insecure, we think something
is going to fall upon us, something horrible

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.870
is going to happen, that’s how we form a
thing.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:04.720
Otherwise our children may be spoiled or our
old people may die, or something may happen,

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.400
we form an organisation.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.609
This is not believing in God.

00:23:09.609 --> 00:23:14.310
Secondly we form, also, organisations because
we hate.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:21.760
But we have never seen the Power of Love,
which is the most beautiful, blissful and

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.049
smoothly working: like a flower becoming a
fruit.

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:29.500
Have you ever seen a flower becoming a fruit?

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.880
Nobody has seen it.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.310
How slowly it becomes!

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.139
Have you ever seen a bud opening into a flower?

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:42.959
You have to put a slow motion camera to catch
that slow movement.

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:49.500
All that is done by this great Power of God,
this Divine Power which is called as ‘Brahma’

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.520
in Sanskrit language.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:58.790
And to know that Brahma is the idea behind
Self-Realisation.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:04.780
It is all-pervading, It is working everywhere,
but we cannot feel It and we have to feel

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.780
That.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.090
And how to feel it?

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.530
How to know that?

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:14.870
The only way is to get yourself connected
with your Self which connects you to that

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.861
All-pervading Power, and it starts flowing
through you.

00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:25.010
If you learn the ways and methods you can
manoeuvre it, you can use it and you can give

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.210
it to others also.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:31.280
It’s a very simple thing like putting a
connection.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.790
Like you come in the room: if you have to
put on the lights, you just have to switch

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.040
on, it’s like that.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.880
It’s very simple.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.040
But when you switch on the light, you must
know that there’s a very huge organisation

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.970
behind this little switch.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:52.300
In the same way, behind all this there’s
a very great organisation of God Almighty,

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.540
which we have not known: we have just heard
about God, “There is God, and let’s pray

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.640
to God,” All that.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.040
But where is He?

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.040
What is He?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.490
And what are we?

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.749
We have never known that.

00:25:03.749 --> 00:25:10.270
So first time you get connected with His Power.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:16.980
Now about Spirit: I mean, in English language
‘spirit’ is used for so many things!

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.300
They will use it for a dead body – it’s
a spirit.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.960
They’ll use it for also spirits: alcohols.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.100
‘Spirit’ for Atma.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:31.040
But where I am talking now it is about the
Atma: the Spirit, which is the reflection

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:39.710
of God Almighty within us, which is the witness,
which watches every moment, every action of

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.710
ours.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.220
And it stays there till it enjoys.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:51.189
To understand the Spirit, we have to know
its nature, what is the nature of the Spirit

00:25:51.189 --> 00:25:57.120
is, and then, when we get enlightenment, what
happens to us.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.750
Now here you have seen three powers, as they
have shown you.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:05.390
The first power is on the right hand side,
is the power of action.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:11.800
I mean the first one is the power of desire
which is on the left hand side, the second

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:17.980
one is the power of action, and in the centre
is the power of, what we call, the sustenance

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.770
which gives you our evolution.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.240
So we have three powers.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.020
All these three powers act within us.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.210
For example the first power of desire.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:38.460
The first power of desire within us acts in
such a manner that we start desiring for things.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.780
Actually the whole universe is created [and]
out of the universe, this beautiful thing

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.480
like human being is created.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:57.210
And this power that has created this special
thing called ‘human being’ is the residual

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:08.280
power that resides in the triangular bone,
for the ultimate desire to be one with the

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.189
Divine.

00:27:10.189 --> 00:27:13.872
But it has not yet manifested, so that is
why it is called as a residual power.

00:27:13.872 --> 00:27:19.830
It has not yet manifested because we have
not yet become one with the Divine.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.570
So that power is still sleeping within us,
that’s why they call it a sleeping Kundalini.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:30.910
But that desire is within us, and that drives
us to all kinds of seeking: we make mistakes,

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:37.400
we do all kinds of wrong choices — doesn’t
matter — everything can be forgiven.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:46.020
But she resides in the triangular bone waiting
for a chance when she could be awakened by

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.280
somebody who has the authority to awaken.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:53.360
As he told you just now that it’s an actualisation,
you cannot just go to a church, and somebody

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.530
puts the hand on your head and he says, “All
right, I have baptised you."

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.900
This is only just a false certificate, you
know that.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.559
It’s a false certificate.

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:08.650
But when this power is manifested, when you
become one with the Divine, when yoga, the

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:15.680
union, takes place, then only we can say that
Kundalini has manifested itself: means your

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.650
desire to be one with the Divine has been
manifested.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:27.030
So now there are four powers I have told you
about: one is the power of desire with which

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.760
we desire other things.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.030
Like we may desire to have a chair.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:40.910
So what we do, if there is some steel which
is dead, we make another dead stuff like called

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.950
a ‘chair’, which is of steel — another
dead.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:49.390
We sit on it [and] we start become habituated
with this: means a part of us is deadened,

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.230
because we can’t sit without a chair, the
chair sits on our head.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.940
People carry chairs with them, because they
just can’t sit without the chairs.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.740
Like that the matter starts fighting your
Spirit, and starts giving you habits.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.090
The another thing of matter is that it never
gives you joy.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:11.740
For example, you want to have a table, all
right, then you want to have a chair, then

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.510
you want to have a car, then you want to have
a helicopter, and never happy!

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:22.170
So, wants in general are never satiable; is
a principle of economics.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.170
Why?

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.360
Because matter cannot give you satisfaction,
that’s why.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.350
It just plays with you.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:33.080
You like one thing, you jump to it, you like
another thing, you jump to another one.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:40.210
Now this matter within us is created by the
right side, that is the power that comes to

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.960
us from five elements.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:50.129
And these five elements, when they are not
enlightened do not give joy.

00:29:50.129 --> 00:29:54.700
They are within us, we use them.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.189
Supposing somebody thinks that, “If I go
to race and if I win a big amount of money

00:29:59.189 --> 00:30:00.189
I’ll be happy."

00:30:00.189 --> 00:30:04.350
But you go and see the person after six months,
you will find that he’s the most unhappy

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.470
person ever known.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.530
Because money is a headache, house is a headache.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.050
Anything that you own is a headache.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.430
It is better that others should own it and
you should enjoy; that’s a better way of

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.430
looking at things.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:22.210
But we think that possession is something
that we can really enjoy, which is not true,

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.170
because we are not going to take anything
with us.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:32.860
Now when these five elements act upon us,
what happens to us?

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.020
What do we develop?

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.230
We develop, in the subtle way, the attention.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:42.050
Say there is something, a matter, here, my
attention can be drawn to it.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.830
If there is something material, my attention
can be drawn to it.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.960
But supposing something is in the ether, I
cannot see it.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.430
Something that is not material I cannot see
it.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.380
So the attention cannot be drawn.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:31:00.170
That’s how our attention is created by these
five elements, within ourselves.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:06.700
Now this attention that we have: naturally
because it is created by the material things,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:14.040
in the sense that it is created by the causal
of these elements, our attention goes to material

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.040
things.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.040
It’s natural, because it is created by that,
isn’t it?

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.040
Our attention is outside.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.530
If I say, “Put your attention inside!”

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.749
How can you?

00:31:20.749 --> 00:31:26.929
I mean there’s no way of putting it inside:
it’s an impossible situation.

00:31:26.929 --> 00:31:30.510
Because anything that happens outside, our
attention goes there.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:36.030
Something material, something substantial
we see, and then our attention goes to that.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.189
But how can you put your attention inside,
because we are lost, we do not know where

00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:42.640
to go, how to find it, how to put our attention
inside.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:50.020
So this attention is within us, and when the
Kundalini rises, then the attention is drawn

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.840
in, because of the happening.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.890
That’s why a happening is necessary.

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:59.119
Supposing suddenly you are listening to me,
and something falls down, your attention will

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:00.119
go to it.

00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:04.870
That is why a happening takes place, that
this Kundalini rises and she attracts the

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:05.870
attention inside.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:11.960
But actually when she touches the Spirit,
what happens to the attention itself?

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.819
The attention becomes enlightened.

00:32:14.819 --> 00:32:17.640
Now what is that?

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.350
Attention becomes enlightened, means what?

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:24.340
Means that this attention has a light.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:30.330
Now supposing you have an attention which
has a light, what should happen?

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.790
That you look at anyone, you should be able
to know that person in and out.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.770
That should be the first thing, isn’t it?

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:39.829
If your attention has the light, you should
be able to see through that person just like

00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:42.229
an x-ray you should know where the problem
is.

00:32:42.229 --> 00:32:47.859
Then, if your attention is enlightened, you
should be able to help that person also, with

00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:49.670
your attention, by paying [attention].

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:56.610
Enlightenment is the enlightenment by the
Divine Power of love.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:02.790
So if you pay attention to somebody, that
love must act.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.860
Otherwise it is just like any other attention:
You pay attention to this, nothing happens.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.660
You pay attention to that, nothing happens.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.070
You pay attention to anyone, nothing happens.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:15.010
But when you are enlightened, then your attention
is enlightened.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:20.160
And you will find, after Sahaja Yoga, if you
pay attention to someone, you can cure that

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.160
person.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:27.540
If you have reached a certain stage of maturity
in Sahaj Yog.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:33.550
Like there was one of the first Sahaja yogis
in England who got his Realisation, who is

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.070
here I think.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.230
He was a little doubtful.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:41.260
And he said, “Mother you said that our attention
gets enlightened: how are we to know about

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.260
other people?”

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.260
I said, “Very easy!

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.820
About whom do you want to know?”

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.860
He said, “I want to know about my father."

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.930
I said, “All right."

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.270
His father was in Scotland.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.469
“You put your hands and think of your father.

00:33:51.469 --> 00:33:52.469
Just think."

00:33:52.469 --> 00:33:54.560
He started a burning here.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.020
Now these are the centres for your father
(right hand) and these are the centres for

00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.670
your mother (left hand).

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.209
And this started burning.

00:34:01.209 --> 00:34:03.690
Now this finger denotes this centre (Vishuddhi).

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:11.450
So I told him he must be down with very bad
bronchitis.

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.370
He said, “How can there be telecommunication?”

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:18.490
This is enlightenment, into a new world of
telecommunication!

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.950
I said, “All right you ring up your father!”

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:21.950
He rang up his father.

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:25.740
And the father never came to the phone.

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:33.270
And his mother said, “Your father is down
with very bad bronchitis."

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.620
Now sitting down here you can give cure to
that.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:40.910
Now it’s not a cock and bull story, I must
tell you.

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.310
It is so fantastic, that people can’t believe
it.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.790
But you can.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.150
But you have to have certain maturity to do
that.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.750
If your light is a little hazy, then it doesn’t
work out.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:57.310
I mean, you can cure people, sitting down
here, sitting down in London: I should say,

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.610
most humbly I can cure them; I have done it.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.260
And some other people have done it also.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:09.150
So what happens is that the attention which
goes there…Now for example, our attention

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.150
is dead in a way.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.630
If it goes there, what happens?

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.360
Only thoughts start coming to us.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.940
On the contrary this [thought] is more dominating
[to us] than ourselves.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.339
Because as soon as we look at something, some
thought starts coming.

00:35:18.339 --> 00:35:21.910
I mean, you can’t look at anything without
some thoughts coming into your head.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.530
I mean, imagine the domination of the matter
on us, that everything gives us a thought!

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:31.010
While, when you look at a thing, when you
are a realised-soul, then this attention acts.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:38.740
If it is a living thing, you can see the action
working on that.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.270
But if it is dead, then what happens?

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.730
Then you become thoughtless.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:51.900
Say you see a beautiful painting, you see
a beautiful painting: now there is no thought

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:57.802
in your mind; so all the creation of that
painting just starts pouring in you as joy.

00:35:57.802 --> 00:36:02.240
You feel that joy just pouring into you, because
there is no thought in between.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.300
Otherwise normally we’ll think, “Who has
painted this picture?”

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.890
“Who has done this?”

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:07.890
How much they must have paid?”

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:08.890
That’s the first thing!

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.300
First question would be how much money it
must have cost!

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.770
Then second would be, “Who is the artist?”

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:23.170
All these questions actually paralyse the
beauty, the art, the creation of that painting.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:33.370
Like [on] a wave-free surface of some lake,
you can see the complete image, the reflection,

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:37.600
of the surroundings of that lake.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.150
The complete creation, the complete joy comes
to us.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.000
In the same way you become absolutely thoughtless.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.930
You see something and you become absolutely
thoughtless, because the joy is so complete,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:55.030
that you just get stunned and the whole thing
starts pouring into you, like showers of joy.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.310
It’s an experience which you cannot have
before Realisation.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:04.240
It’s only possible after Realisation: that
you can enjoy your attention.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.410
And it is such a joker.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:11.810
Your attention plays tricks and tells you
so many things about other people.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:16.400
Like, I was coming and I said, “Now let
us see.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.860
This gentleman, I have to meet him.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.790
Let me see his vibrations."

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:21.940
I said, “Now.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.339
His vibrations: this is catching."

00:37:23.339 --> 00:37:24.610
All right, what does that mean?

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:31.150
A problem with his wife: either he has no
wife, or if he has a wife, it’s a wrong

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.656
relationship, or maybe there’s a problem
with the wife.

00:37:32.656 --> 00:37:36.240
This is wife’s [centre].

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.130
And we discovered it was so.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.280
But because I knew about it, I didn’t touch
that point.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.130
Because if you say that, you will have it!

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.470
So better not say that point.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.310
You know already about the gentleman, what
sort of a problem he has, so better not touch

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:50.740
that point and gradually try to remove it.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.650
Like that, it is so easy, after Realisation,
to know about others.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:02.200
Like a gentleman came to see me, he was an
Indian and he knew that a person who is a

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.589
seeker is not supposed to drink, when you
come at least to a holy person.

00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:11.870
But he gave up his drinking: for about eight
days he did not drink, he had a bath everything;

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:15.670
he had a nice mouthwash with everything and
he came and saw me.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.940
And I said, “You have to give up your alcohol
completely."

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.610
He said, “Mother how do you know this?”

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.000
I said, “I know!”

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.520
Because the centres that are catching in him
are only possible if you are a drunkard.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.640
And I said, “You have been a drunkard, and
that is why it has been there."

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.390
He agreed that, “I was.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.209
But eight days back I gave it up.

00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:37.230
I said, “Eight days makes no difference!

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:40.900
I know that you have been a drunkard, and
you’ll have to give up that gradually."

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.240
He said, “I will Mother, I promise you."

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.050
But this is really surprised him: how did
I know about it?

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:54.000
So much so that once a lady came to see me,
and I found that her right hand here, was

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.550
completely charring, and this was all catching.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:03.060
So I asked her, “What is your relationship
with your father?”

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.969
Especially this finger.

00:39:04.969 --> 00:39:08.490
“Oh,” she said, “what has it to do with
it?”.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:13.080
Normally girls in India are very attached
to their fathers and, it’s a very good relationship.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.030
I said, “There must be something wrong,
otherwise you can’t get such horrible feelings

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.030
about it."

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.230
“Yes but how do you know Mother?”

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.790
I said, “I know, you better tell me."

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.469
“Oh, it’s all right, it’s all right.

00:39:23.469 --> 00:39:25.630
We have a good relationship, nothing wrong,
this, that."

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.630
I said, “Really?”

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.250
She said, “Yes, we have no [problem].

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.390
I mean, it’s perfectly all right!”

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.390
And she went away.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.730
I was wondering; I knew she was telling me
lies.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:40.760
Just after that, her mother came in, and her
father and they said, “Oh that was our daughter

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.940
who had come to see you."

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.940
I said, “Really?”

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:49.190
He said, “Do you know this girl has filed
a [law] suit against me, her father?”

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.190
“Really?”

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:51.190
“Yes!

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.190
And on wrong basis.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.219
Under the advice of a very wrong person.

00:39:54.219 --> 00:39:57.580
Her husband is abroad, and some wrong person
has put ideas into her head, and she has filed

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.400
a suit against me."

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.010
“Aaaah!”

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.010
I said, “See!

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.010
That’s what happened!”

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.839
So the attention gives you all the information:
when it is enlightened.

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:11.810
It corrects the problems.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:18.630
And of all the things it warns you, it warns
you beforehand.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:23.540
For a Sahaja Yogi, supposing a Sahaja Yogi
is misled, he loses the way, then it is accepted

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.790
that we have to go that way, there is something
we have to do.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.069
And just he goes that way and he finds the
thing that he has lost for a long time, or

00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:34.360
he meets a friend whom he has to meet or some
address that he had, he gets it.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:41.329
We don’t mind getting lost or anything because
you find that this was necessary to go that

00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:43.030
way to find something.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.671
It’s so interesting and so interwoven.

00:40:44.671 --> 00:40:50.690
And sometimes you start understanding, after
some time, that there are angels who are looking

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.690
after you.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:55.709
Definitely there are angels who are guiding
us.

00:40:55.709 --> 00:41:02.630
Every moment, they are there, and taking our
attention to things which are important.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:08.890
Because of Spirit’s quality, to be collectively
conscious, our attention itself becomes collectively

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:09.890
conscious.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.839
The priorities change.

00:41:12.839 --> 00:41:16.510
The priorities change so much.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:24.400
Like I was going in Kashmir one day, in a
car, and suddenly I told my husband, that

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.219
there is tremendous vibrations in this place.

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:32.430
So he asked the driver: he said, “Is there
any temple here?”

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.719
He said, “No, it’s a wilderness.

00:41:34.719 --> 00:41:36.280
There is no temple, nothing!”

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.010
I said, “About two, three miles maybe.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.010
Let’s go ahead."

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.960
So he said, “No there’s some muslims staying
here.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.199
There’s no temple, no question of having
a temple."

00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:45.230
I said, “Is there a mosque?”

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.589
“Oh,” he said, “Yes.

00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:49.449
There is a mosque of Hazratbal!”

00:41:49.449 --> 00:41:54.310
One hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept in that
mosque.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:58.010
And I felt the vibrations at least four, five
miles away from it!

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.010
Just imagine!

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.810
And when we came about three miles, I could
just tell him how to go there.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.800
And only one hair was emitting [so many] vibrations.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.680
So the whole priority, the attention, goes
to things which have good, Divine vibrations.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.400
It is not bothered about things which have
no good vibrations.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.430
Whatever has good vibrations, it will go to
that.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.790
Like a person who is a holy person, he touches
anything, it vibrates.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.079
He touches water, it vibrates.

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:28.110
Anything you touch, anything you feel, it
vibrates it.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:33.630
For example, water, if you vibrate it, it
can be a medicine.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.719
River Ganges is nothing but vibrated water!

00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:38.680
You get vibrations from that.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:45.550
These vibrations are Divine vibrations, are
the vibrations of the power of love of God.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:50.620
It is something so much out of the blue, that
suddenly if you hear about these things, it

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:56.890
sounds quite odd and fantastic But it is not
at all to Indians, they know about all it.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.240
This knowledge has not come to us.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.430
But in the Bible, Christ has said that, “Your
hands will speak."

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:08.209
Your hands will speak: that means in your
hands you will be feeling it.

00:43:08.209 --> 00:43:10.550
He said it very clearly.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.530
Your hands will speak: that is what should
happen to us.

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:19.010
That our hands should speak, means they should
communicate to us what they have to communicate.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.930
Because all the centres are represented in
our hand.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:27.800
As shown there you can see all the centres
are on the left hand side and right hand side,

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.280
you can see very clearly how these centres
are denoted on our hand.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.849
And once you start feeling them, if you know
the decoding of it, you can immediately say

00:43:36.849 --> 00:43:41.599
what the other person is suffering from, what
you are suffering from.

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:47.250
And then you have to learn how to correct
them, those problems of the another person.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:53.800
So the first thing that happens to you [is]
that your attention becomes enlightened.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:44:05.150
This attention is so wonderful, is so joy-giving,
it’s so humorous, because you become like

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.959
a witness; the whole thing becomes a joke.

00:44:07.959 --> 00:44:13.580
You see people seriously running up and down
to do something, and you just don’t understand.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.380
And you ask them, “What’s the matter with
you?”

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.380
“Oh, you don’t know?

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.380
It’s very important, very important!”

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.380
“Yes what?”

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.890
“I have put all my money for the race."

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:26.040
And he comes back, head hung!

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.430
“What happened?”

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.290
“I lost all my money!”

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.880
The way he was running, the way he is coming
back, is a big joke.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.511
But to him it’s not: he becomes serious,
sometimes he becomes involved into in, sometimes

00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:39.740
elated, but you are just enjoying the whole
joke.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:44.270
The whole tragedy and comedy of life you enjoy,
like a spectator.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:49.420
You become the spectator: you are no more
worried, upset or in tension.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:55.110
Actually I have seen people who are very hot
tempered become so placid and so sweet and

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.110
so poised.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:45:01.670
It’s surprising how they change, because
they have got the balancing point, the absolute

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:02.670
point.

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.270
This is what happens to your attention when
you get Realisation.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:11.589
But then what happens to your awareness, which
you get from the central path of your evolution?

00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:16.449
For example animals have an awareness.

00:45:16.449 --> 00:45:18.890
Also we have an awareness.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.100
We have awareness much higher than that of
animals.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.770
Some people say, “Yes we can play tennis,
you see."

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:29.010
that’s a higher awareness than animals.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.790
But some people cannot play tennis or understand
it.

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:37.339
But one awareness human beings have, definitely
— whatever they may be, at whatever level

00:45:37.339 --> 00:45:41.189
— that they understand what is dirty, what
is filthy.

00:45:41.189 --> 00:45:43.380
They can smell it; animals can’t.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:50.189
You take a horse or a dog through a dirty
length, it will just walk like a king, as

00:45:50.189 --> 00:45:54.640
if it’s leading a parade for the queen — it
has no problems.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.270
But for human beings we just can’t do it!

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.589
We have to put something to cover our nose.

00:45:59.589 --> 00:46:05.290
So, like that, we have many other things which
we have achieved as human beings.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:08.839
We have sense of colour, we have sense of
beauty, we have sense of balance.

00:46:08.839 --> 00:46:15.890
We have so many things, which dogs may not
have, horses may not have, dolphins may not

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:16.890
have.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.099
They are so close to us — they live with
us — but they may not have those senses

00:46:20.099 --> 00:46:21.780
as we have.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:27.800
But now, what happens to human awareness,
at this stage, is that this human awareness

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.730
suddenly jumps up into a new dimension.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.839
You become collectively conscious.

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:32.900
You become!

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:33.900
Again, I say.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.610
It’s an actualisation: it happens to your
awareness.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.339
You just become collectively conscious.

00:46:41.339 --> 00:46:49.280
Means, little children, today Olympia, she
was interviewing me, she came and she put

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.250
her fingers in her ears, because the lady
who was talking to me had a problem in her

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:56.120
throat.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:00.400
Perhaps maybe she has to use her throat too
much also, or maybe something else.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.980
So she put her fingers in her ears.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.160
You see, this is the mantra we use “Allah
hu akbar” by putting fingers.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.689
The little one, she is very small, about two
years of age, she just put in.

00:47:08.689 --> 00:47:15.360
But still she felt she has not helped me fully,
so she put both her fingers in the mouth to

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.130
suggest that please look after the lady, she’s
got this problem.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:26.920
The concern and the feeling that you get for
another person is so tremendous, so tremendous,

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.020
that people can’t understand but it’s
very simple [to explain], because if you become

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.860
part and parcel of the person, how can you
not have concern?

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.740
I mean who is the other?

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:40.689
The problem is [that] now, supposing you are
sitting before me, and you have a problem

00:47:40.689 --> 00:47:43.420
in your stomach, I’ll also have a little
problem.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:47.720
And I’ll be so concerned about that problem
that it is as if in my stomach that problem

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.939
is existing.

00:47:48.939 --> 00:47:50.110
It is like that.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.780
The awareness becomes so collectively conscious
that it becomes part and parcel of you.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.940
Who is the other?

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.620
The feeling of otherness goes away.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.969
Now people talk big things like, “We are
all united,” “We are all brothers and

00:48:01.969 --> 00:48:04.100
sisters, and this and this."

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.430
You must have heard all these speeches.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:08.800
And when it comes to war, they’ll fight.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.180
But in this, you cannot fight, because who
is the other?

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.180
You can’t fight your nose.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.250
You can’t fight your hand.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:14.770
You can’t fight your fingers.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.280
Nor do you help anyone.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.500
You don’t help anyone.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:22.709
Because supposing this finger is in trouble
and this hand presses it, does it help it?

00:48:22.709 --> 00:48:23.709
Nothing!

00:48:23.709 --> 00:48:25.390
This is neither obliged, nor this is helping.

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:26.559
This is one.

00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:32.840
That feeling of oneness — that you are part
and parcel of the whole is — established.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.670
Because of that feeling, that is such a tremendous
feeling that you are part and parcel of the

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:40.000
whole, that you get cured.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:50.880
The curing comes because of that innate understanding
by your being, that you are not alone: you

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:58.100
are part and parcel of the whole, you are
a cell of the whole body of God, or you are

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.650
a microcosm of the macrocosm.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:06.630
This is not just a psychological or a rational
thing, but you just become.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.149
You just become, you can’t help it.

00:49:09.149 --> 00:49:13.040
And when you are that, you just don’t feel
you are helping anyone.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.740
It’s just like one cell acting for another
cell.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.280
The whole thing works in such a homogeneous
way: no fighting, no quarrelling.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.050
On the contrary, you enjoy each other!

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.180
You just love each other.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.430
And you just see the good points of another
person.

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:29.870
You don’t see the bad points.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:34.059
You forget the race, you forget all creeds,
and everything you forget.

00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:37.180
Because a nose doesn’t say, “I am higher
than the hands!”

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.180
Does it say?

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.830
Or the feet do not say, “I am lower than
the hands!”

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:41.830
They all are required.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:45.389
Supposing there is something wrong with the
feet, you will just try to help.

00:49:45.389 --> 00:49:47.709
Something wrong with the nose, you’ll help
your nose.

00:49:47.709 --> 00:49:49.780
You don’t discriminate in your body, do
you?

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.570
In the same way, we do not discriminate.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:57.959
Once you become realised-souls, whether you
are from India or from Asia, or from any other

00:49:57.959 --> 00:50:00.101
place, from England, America, any place you
may be.

00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:05.290
You may be Chinese: every sort of faces that
we have, in the cross section of Sahaja Yogis!

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:09.540
You will find all kinds of people are there,
and they all love each other.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:14.130
You must see the way when these people from
England went to India, to the villages where

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:16.500
I worked: the villagers just grabbed them!

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:22.520
And they were so happy: they said, “First
time we are meeting our brothers and sisters!”

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.860
And these people were just enjoying them,
and they all started dancing.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.940
Of course they are very light-footed and they
wanted all these people to dance with them.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.300
And though the Britishers are not so light-footed
as they are, so they found it rather difficult.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.010
So they made them jump, jump, jump!

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:40.800
And now they have become good dancers too;
and they all dance together and sing together,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.470
in complete joy and understanding.

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:46.159
The whole attitude towards life changes.

00:50:46.159 --> 00:50:51.940
You become really a princess in the sense
that you don’t need anything — there is

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:52.940
no dearth.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.149
If there is a dearth then you are beggar.

00:50:55.149 --> 00:50:58.420
If there is no dearth, you can sleep here,
you can sleep in a palace.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:02.899
If you want you can get a Rolls Royce or if
you want, you can walk.

00:51:02.899 --> 00:51:04.129
What’s the harm?

00:51:04.129 --> 00:51:05.369
What’s the difference?

00:51:05.369 --> 00:51:09.639
Because the joy comes from your Spirit, not
from outside things.

00:51:09.639 --> 00:51:11.760
The whole idea of comfort changes.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.230
The whole idea of luxury changes.

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:19.420
It’s all completely changed because you
enter into this new dimension.

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:23.780
And that’s what happens to your awareness:
that you become collectively conscious.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:30.540
The enlightenment gives a human awareness
a new dimension by which you are collectively

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.690
conscious.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:37.570
Now emotion gives us happiness: if you love
somebody you feel happy, and [if] you meet

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:39.570
that person you feel happy.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.389
And you want to bestow all your love on that
person.

00:51:42.389 --> 00:51:46.530
If your children are there, you want to love
them, and give them love.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:50.210
But before Realisation, this joy is limited.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:53.920
For example, husband wife relation I can understand.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.980
But about children, like in India: they love
their children so much that they will even

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.240
sell their country for their children’s
sake.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.869
The love becomes like a possession.

00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:05.510
It becomes a love hate relationship.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.980
They love so much that they come to hatred.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.750
It’s a funny thing but it happens.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:11.750
Why?

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.230
Because it has limitations.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:17.250
Love has limitations: it’s not infinite.

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:22.260
But when you get your love enlightened you
get joy.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:29.240
There’s no material given thing, just you
enjoy each other.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.149
In Calcutta first time on my way to America
I had gone.

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:36.740
I was staying in a hotel and there were five
or six other Sahaja Yogis staying with me,

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.740
in other rooms.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:43.270
And one gentleman came to see me, and he fell
at my feet, and tremendous vibrations he had.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:46.369
And they all rushed: “Who has come?

00:52:46.369 --> 00:52:47.690
Who has come?”

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:49.020
I said, “Why?”

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:51.210
“Tremendous joy started flowing on our head,
Mother!

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.210
Who is at your feet?”

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:53.210
They all rushed to me.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:56.180
I said, “See this one."

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.180
“Haahh!”

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.659
They all stood, ‘Haahh!

00:53:00.659 --> 00:53:01.659
What enjoyment!

00:53:01.659 --> 00:53:02.659
What enjoyment!”

00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:03.659
He was enjoying.

00:53:03.659 --> 00:53:04.659
They were enjoying him.

00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:05.659
This is the first time you enjoy human beings.

00:53:05.659 --> 00:53:09.010
Because you can feel the vibrations of a person.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:15.360
What a beauty [a] human being is, what a glory
he is, what a blessing he is, what a creation

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.910
he is, you realise only after Realisation.

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:24.690
Before that, you judge him — “Oh he has
got long hair,” “He has got red hair,”

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:28.260
“He has got long nose” — All that.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.680
But then you just see him in a subtle way.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.450
What he is, is his vibrations.

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:36.941
And so many people I have seen — Sahaja
Yogis also — if they get somebody they’ll

00:53:36.941 --> 00:53:37.941
all rush there.

00:53:37.941 --> 00:53:41.220
The fellow is there, and they are all taking
vibrations, for half an hour and I am tired.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.280
I say, “Now finish it off!”

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:48.490
But no they are just sucking it like a child.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:55.770
First time you enjoy human beings — the
joy which has not duality.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:59.139
Joy does not have happiness and unhappiness.

00:53:59.139 --> 00:54:02.149
Happiness comes to us when our ego is pampered.

00:54:02.149 --> 00:54:06.850
Unhappiness comes to us when our ego is damped.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:07.930
It is something different.

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:11.020
We are not our egos, we are our Self.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:14.740
And when Self enjoys something, it enjoys
it.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:20.200
There is no remorse, there is no duality about
it, there is no unhappiness.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.120
So joy is a complete thing.

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.210
It cannot be described.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.820
It is just to be experienced, and enjoyed
within ourselves.

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.330
And that’s what happens to us.

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:35.270
When we get our Realisation our idea of love
changes.

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:39.570
Like, you say, “Oh I love this person only."

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:43.970
Like your husband is there, you have to love
him like a husband.

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.110
You don’t love everybody like a husband.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.960
Your sister is there, you love her like a
sister.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.760
But you think all others as your sisters.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.760
Then you love your brothers; you think them
to be your brothers.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.360
You love all of them.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.180
The love spreads, like that.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.070
It does not rest in one place.

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:07.210
It does not stagnate, it does not coagulate.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:14.150
Supposing in a plant, sap is rising and it
goes to one flower because it loves it, and

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:15.159
settles down there.

00:55:15.159 --> 00:55:17.930
The tree will die and the flower will die.

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:24.300
So the love we have before Realisation, is
like that love, which dies ultimately or creates

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.300
problems and it dies.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.240
But love after Realisation is a love that
emits, just flows.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.940
You don’t get anything.

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.680
“What do you get?”

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.680
people ask me.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:40.460
I mean my husband is in a different line and
I have a double life, and all my friends ask,

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.379
“What do you get out of it?”

00:55:42.379 --> 00:55:44.740
I say, “I am not here to get.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.750
I get out something from me.

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:49.540
It’s just to give, is to enjoy."

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.550
As I told your mayor today, “Your politics
will be solved.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:53.550
You’ll have no parties."

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.639
He said, “How can that be?”

00:55:54.639 --> 00:56:01.830
I said, “See now: I have supposing all the
powers, so I am a capitalist.

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.639
But I must share, so I’m a communist.

00:56:03.639 --> 00:56:07.300
I have to be a pure communist and a pure capitalist.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:13.460
So how can I have two parties when both the
things exist within me?”

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.460
That’s how you solve your politics.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.460
How do you solve your economics?

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:21.480
The whole transaction areas and all those
things come from a false idea that matter

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.580
can give us happiness: it cannot.

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:30.760
Only the matter that has a certain coefficience,
which gives vibrations, is the only thing

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.760
that gives you joy.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.530
Now we don’t know if there is such matter
around.

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:37.170
For example somebody will say Stonehenge.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:39.500
I mean, it looks funny with the druids.

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.600
Of course they don’t know anything, I agree.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:47.899
But it is not [funny], because Stonehenge
is created by the Mother Earth.

00:56:47.899 --> 00:56:48.899
It has vibrations.

00:56:48.899 --> 00:56:53.270
They can’t feel anything, they are standing
there, singing songs, this, that.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.900
Somebody must have felt in their forefathers.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:02.300
There are many places where you get vibrations
from the Mother Earth, so many.

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:07.080
It is written in the Bible, in the ten commandments,
only that whatever is created by the Mother

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.930
Earth or by the sky should not be reproduced
by human beings and worshipped.

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:17.020
But there are many things which have come
out of the Mother Earth.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.420
But unless and until you have vibrations,
how will you know?

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.740
You don’t know the truth.

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:25.450
So in the human awareness, to know the truth,
is very relative.

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:30.350
You will say that, “How is it that this
person is fake and that person is not fake?”

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:32.159
“This is truth that is not truth?”

00:57:32.159 --> 00:57:33.659
There’s no way of knowing it.

00:57:33.659 --> 00:57:37.770
Unless and until you get to the Absolute point,
how will you know the relative?

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:40.690
So when you get your Realisation, you can
ask, “Is he a real man?”

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:45.220
If he is, you will get vibrations.

00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:53.510
If he’s not, then, you might even get blisters;
vibrations will stop maybe; little bit blisters

00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:56.740
you might get, if he is not a right type of
a person.

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.619
If somebody is obstinate, you will get indication.

00:57:59.619 --> 00:58:03.293
If somebody is suffering from some possession,
you will get indication.

00:58:03.293 --> 00:58:06.970
If somebody is mentally mad, you will know.

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:11.020
It’s very, very systematic, and very scientific.

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:18.200
God’s laws never fail, [are] very attentive,
and everything that you know through it is

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.659
absolute and correct.

00:58:19.659 --> 00:58:24.810
Only thing is you have to learn: you have
to train up your mind to understand these

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:25.810
different things.

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:31.620
But small children are much cleverer than
bigger people; because you see, they have

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:36.510
so many hangups, they have so many complications,
they rationalise everything.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:41.950
Children will just say this: “This is this!”

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:46.920
Now people think that, “How can it be free?”

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.400
How can it be with money?

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.440
I ask the other question!

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:57.750
We cannot think of these things in the terms
that I’d say [is] Divine, because you have

00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:59.609
never known it before.

00:58:59.609 --> 00:59:02.310
How much money did Christ get?

00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:08.100
We have a life here of Christ: how much money
did he take?

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:12.520
Now Christianity as such — they asked me
a question today — I mean it cannot deliver

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.540
the goods!

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:21.940
They are Christians, they go to church, but
is their life Christian?

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.409
Churches cannot deliver the goods.

00:59:23.409 --> 00:59:26.470
But that doesn’t mean that you run away
from Christ.

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:31.690
You can run away from that kind of things,
but not from Christ, because Christ exists.

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:37.870
He definitely exists within us, and is a special
person because he’s placed at a very pivotal

00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:53.629
point, between the centre of the optic chiasma,
where the pituitary and pineal body are there

00:59:53.629 --> 00:59:56.350
and he controls our ego and superego.

00:59:56.350 --> 01:00:00.750
And when the Kundalini rises, then Christ
is awakened, and he sucks all of our karmas,

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.010
all of our sins.

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:05.609
That’s what he said — that he has suffered
for our sins.

01:00:05.609 --> 01:00:11.970
They will say Christ, in the church they say
it, and then why do they ask you to suffer?

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:15.840
If Christ has suffered, why should we suffer
anymore?

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.960
There should be no sufferings anymore, just
enjoy and rejoice.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.840
He’s done everything for us.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.540
Or do you want him to suffer more?

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:28.850
There are Jews who said, that, “We don’t
believe in Christ, and we have to suffer."

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:30.690
Already, “Have Mr Hitler for you!”

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:33.630
If they want another one, they can have another
one.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.490
And go on with your suffering.

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:39.280
It is high time that they accept Christ and
give up their sufferings, otherwise, they

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.650
are putting their sufferings on other people.

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.320
There is no suffering needed anymore.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:51.619
It’s a funny idea, I don’t understand,
why people say you must suffer to become spiritual?

01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:54.820
Who has given you these ideas?

01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:01.460
Actually among Hindus it was believed that,
our karmas, we have to pay for it.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.879
Yes, all right.

01:01:02.879 --> 01:01:04.240
Up to what point?

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.300
Till somebody called Mahavishnu comes in:
that is Christ.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.300
He’s called as ‘Mahavishnu’.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:17.359
All the signs and symptoms of Christ are described
as Mahavishnu in the Devi Mahatmyam, but who

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:18.359
reads that?

01:01:18.359 --> 01:01:19.820
I mean Christians will only read Bible!

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.730
Will they read something else?

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:23.730
So they never knew.

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:27.080
And when the missionaries went from here,
they never talked about Christ like that.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.670
“Oh,” they just said, “you’d better
get converted."

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:32.200
They used to brand everyone: Christian, Christian,
Christian, Christian.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.820
They would put a loaf of bread in the water,
and say that, “This is the beef, and all

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.139
of you have become now Christians!”

01:01:40.139 --> 01:01:41.430
So by villages they became Christians.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:45.730
Imagine this kind of a Christianity, how far
is it going to go?

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:50.250
They never said that Christ is the one who
was Mahavishnu because they never knew.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:56.720
Until I told them that it was he, the Mahavishnu
who came, who has come already.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.020
And he is going to suck our [karmas].

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.190
So this is done, then what?

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:01.639
Why to worry about karmas?

01:02:01.639 --> 01:02:02.639
[They are] finished!

01:02:02.639 --> 01:02:04.119
All our karmas are over.

01:02:04.119 --> 01:02:08.670
But here we have Christ, but we don’t know
his essence.

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:13.180
We don’t know what is he there for, what
was the need for him to crucify himself.

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:21.190
It was just to create a tremendous Deity within
us, that is Christ, who will suck our up our

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:22.190
[bad] vibrations.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:24.260
Now we have many Jews who are our disciples.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.400
They will jolly well have to accept Christ,
because Kundalini does not rise unless and

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.900
until you accept it here.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.930
But even those Christians who don’t accept,
say Moses, or Jehovah: they have to accept

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:39.290
that Jehovah is sitting here (above Agnya).

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:41.399
That’s the Viraata.

01:02:41.399 --> 01:02:46.210
That’s the Akbar: that, you have to see
for yourself when the Kundalini rises.

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:51.010
You’ll be amazed, unless and until you say
Lord’s prayer, it won’t rise above this

01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:53.170
(Agnya), if it is stuck there.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.240
And all the Christians have this problem.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.450
You will be surprised that Christ himself
is angry with them.

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:02.139
You have to say Lord’s prayer.

01:03:02.139 --> 01:03:06.470
That’s why he said, “You will be calling
me ‘Christ, Christ,’ and I won’t recognise

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:07.470
[you]."

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:10.430
Just imagine!

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:17.630
Then you have to say Lord’s prayer in front
of some holy personality [so that] he forgives

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:22.909
you, and then the Kundalini rises.

01:03:22.909 --> 01:03:27.359
Just imagine — he was the one who was the
controller of ego, he is the one who sucks

01:03:27.359 --> 01:03:33.200
our ego, and see the Christian nations: if
there is one thing they cannot get out is

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.200
their ego.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.450
Now they are realising it, no doubt.

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:39.359
But still to get out of it, they have to fight
it; and the more you fight it, it becomes

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:42.950
like a balloon — big, big, big, big, big.

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.430
But by fighting it you cannot get out of it.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:52.300
Only by rising through the central path you
can suck it, through the awakening of Christ,

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:56.210
and you get your Realisation as cool breeze
coming out of your head.

01:03:56.210 --> 01:04:04.020
But when it happens also, as I said, people
do not know what it is — these Brahma Shakti

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:09.340
or what you call this cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost, what it is, because they didn’t allow

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.340
Christ to live long.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.560
He lived for hardly three and a half years
to talk about it.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:19.879
I mean the way they treated him was really
so atrocious and so cruel.

01:04:19.879 --> 01:04:25.320
To whom could he talk, to these fishermen?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320
About Kundalini?

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.730
I mean they made it impossible!

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:33.920
Same with Mohammed Sahib: Arabs could not
accept Mohammed at all.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.830
And they have not yet accepted him, the way
they are crucifying him everyday.

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.920
He couldn’t tell people about it.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.590
But he did promise that it will happen to
you.

01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:52.490
He’s promised that a Comforter will come,
so that you will know my Father forever — means

01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:53.490
you will get your Self-Realisation.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.760
He promised it.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.920
But how will you make him out?

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.730
How will you make out the Comforter?

01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:00.910
How will you find out, if Christ comes in?

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:03.230
Now some ‘christ’ is being announced.

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.890
It’s a big joke.

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.700
You’d better tell this ‘Mr Christ’ to
walk on the water.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.800
And you’ll find him out!

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.619
We had one in India.

01:05:12.619 --> 01:05:15.240
He told that he is going to walk on the water.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.520
And mad people from America, they came with
televisions, telescopes, and all Indians were

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.139
there to see the fun of the whole thing.

01:05:22.139 --> 01:05:26.140
All of them came here and Government also
encouraged people because lots of foreign

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.020
exchange, you know, for this kind of tomfoolery!

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:37.790
They all came, they occupied premises in a
very big hotel, where there was a huge big

01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:43.710
swimming bath, where this fellow was supposed
to walk on the water.

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:47.159
And they had telescopes and every sort of
thing there.

01:05:47.159 --> 01:05:52.720
And apart from that they had a television
set, and from America they were going to release

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.120
all the scenes of what was going to happen.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.770
This fellow came forward, it was on the television,
you could see it.

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:02.700
He put one foot, and with the second foot
he was down!

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:03.700
(laughter) He couldn’t even swim!

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.700
Can you imagine?

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.180
And they had to fish him out!

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:17.450
And he was put in the hospital, and they found
he had cancer.

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:20.590
But imagine, when they asked, “Why did you
do all this?”

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:24.080
He said, “At least I got a name!”

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080
Imagine!

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.470
Like some hijackers, they say that, “At
least by doing these things, we will get some

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:28.470
name."

01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:32.859
You know there are some maniacs who want to
appear in the newspaper this way or that way.

01:06:32.859 --> 01:06:35.350
So he said, “I got a big name, in America.

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:36.530
Everywhere, everyone knows me!”

01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:39.820
Thank God he’s no more now to befool some.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.960
You see these tricks they play.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.670
So these tricks have nothing to do with God.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:47.359
If he’s Christ, let him walk on the water!

01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:51.899
If you people will be kind enough, you better
write to this gentleman who has spent so much

01:06:51.899 --> 01:06:56.180
money in the newspapers, especially to the
journalists I would request.

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.830
Because journalism takes to such stupid people
very easily, I don’t know why.

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:00.830
They will publish.

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:04.859
You know they published such a lot of things
about this nonsensical ‘christ’ who has

01:07:04.859 --> 01:07:05.859
come.

01:07:05.859 --> 01:07:06.859
Better ask him.

01:07:06.859 --> 01:07:10.590
There’s another one who was trying to teach
flying.

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:16.310
Poor things who were flying, one of them is
sitting here, she was the directress of the

01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:20.820
institution, got epilepsy, the husband got
epilepsy, the child got epilepsy, all of them.

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:24.560
They lost all their money, all their property,
everything.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.700
That’s how they were flying on the streets
of London.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.810
I said, “Why not ask the guru to fly?

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:33.250
Why not use these leaning tower of Pisa?

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.250
Just throw him down.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.700
Let’s see how far he can fly!”

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.619
And then they were paying £3,000 to learn
flying nonsense!

01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:40.129
Why do you want to fly?

01:07:40.129 --> 01:07:46.599
Are you going to become birds now?

01:07:46.599 --> 01:07:53.450
Like these nonsensical tricks they play on
you, and you believe them.

01:07:53.450 --> 01:08:02.190
It is never said in any scripture, any books,
anywhere that you will be flying as religious

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:06.879
people or as spiritual people — never!

01:08:06.879 --> 01:08:10.129
Nor that you will be becoming mad.

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:15.460
Even ‘St’ Paul who was — I don’t know
how they included him in the Bible — I can’t

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.379
understand how was he a Christian?

01:08:17.379 --> 01:08:18.460
This is first thing.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.820
If he saw the light, well and good.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.470
Who saw the light?

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:26.379
Now supposing you go and say, “I have seen
the light, and I have become a great Christian!”

01:08:26.379 --> 01:08:31.139
and you start organising it, must you be included
in Bible?

01:08:31.139 --> 01:08:34.040
He has no idea of Christ, and he has no idea
of reality!

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.810
When I saw him [in The Bible] I said, “From
where does this gentleman come in?”

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:46.690
He was nowhere near reality and he said, that
people got like mad when Holy Ghost came,

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:52.260
everybody started laughing and they started
saying all kinds of words and all kinds of

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.260
languages.

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.180
It’s very easy.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:01.810
You see, say if an Indian possesses you, you
will start behaving just like an Indian: you’ll

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:06.780
speak Indian language, you may be thieving,
telling lies — all these things which are

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:07.780
their character.

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:12.500
Or if you are an English man entered into
an Indian, you will start speaking Oxbridge

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.790
English.

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:19.859
It’s possible — you have seen these things
happening to people when they get possessed,

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:21.220
they do it.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.590
It’s all possession.

01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:25.010
What is the way to know what you have got?

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:31.280
It’s so much unknown that, anything that
is unknown is not God!

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:36.750
There is collective subconscious, and there
is collective supraconscious.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.420
Anybody can enter in from that area and can
possess us.

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:47.380
You must have seen a film shown by some doctors
who said that cancer is caused by some proteins

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:54.830
— proteins which come to us from the areas
which are built within us since the time of

01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:57.500
our creation — that’s collective subconscious.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.320
They say it clearly — protein 58 to protein
52.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:09.450
They say it so clearly about it that, that
is what triggers our cancer.

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:10.859
But they don’t know how to control them.

01:10:10.859 --> 01:10:13.940
Of course, I have been saying this for the
last twelve years!

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.560
But nobody understood at that time when I
was saying that it is the collective subconscious

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.040
from where these things come in.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.380
Christ is the one who took out [dead] spirits
and put in the pigs.

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:30.440
And here they are talking of Christian movements
like you have got Pentecostals and charismatic

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.879
and this and that, where they are putting
spirits into you!

01:10:33.879 --> 01:10:39.010
And when they come before me, they shake like
this — just like this — and go into an

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:40.010
epileptic mood.

01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:43.180
I sometimes you see there are a hundred spirits
sitting in those people.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.859
They have no idea as to what to do with the
dead, they are so naïve.

01:10:47.859 --> 01:10:52.060
In the church you are sitting on a dead body
— God knows how many.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.359
They don’t know how to do that.

01:10:55.359 --> 01:11:00.560
For example if an Indian lady from India comes
in, she walks like this, saving her feet,

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.660
“Oh God, they are sleeping here!”

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:09.020
We know that when they are buried there, maybe
their dead souls are around.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:14.310
But here in the church you go: I mean [it’s]
a very nice way of possessing a person!

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:22.589
There’s a Sahaja Yogini in Paris: her mother
was about sixty years of age — not very

01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:27.100
old because I am of that age — and she was
so mad, she became so mad, that she did not

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.780
know what was a bidet and what was a WC.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:37.770
And she was a funny woman, and she sometimes
used to forget even her daughter!

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:44.760
But Sunday morning she would get up in a very
normal way, dress up very well, go to the

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.040
church, say her prayers and come back.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.310
I mean, like a possessed person, she used
to walk.

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:54.599
But somehow one of the Sundays she got lost
and she informed the police.

01:11:54.599 --> 01:11:59.399
The police said, “You better send her to
one of these places where the old are looked

01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:00.399
after."

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:06.089
So this Marie told me that, when they put
her there, she found there are many like this

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:07.830
who get up on Sundays!

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:09.930
There is a church for them.

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.830
Also there are dead bodies of these mad women.

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:17.320
They go to this church every Sunday, again
they are mad for the whole week, again on

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.680
the Sunday, they get up and go to the church
and come back.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.980
Just imagine!

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.399
How can that be God?

01:12:25.399 --> 01:12:27.389
You mean these dead spirits are God?

01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:31.690
And will He shake you all the time like this,
if God enters into you?

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:34.389
How can it be?

01:12:34.389 --> 01:12:35.740
It’s maddening.

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:41.849
Will you become more dignified and beautiful,
or you will become ridiculous?

01:12:41.849 --> 01:12:42.990
Just ask a question to yourself?

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:47.420
In the Bible, it is written that everybody
said that these people are possessed, and

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.580
they laughed at them, and they said they have
gone mad.

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.889
And still it is in the Bible, and people read
it!

01:12:52.889 --> 01:12:54.950
“Let us read chapter this…”

01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:57.560
Just imagine describing mad people!

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560
And that has become ‘authentic’, now who
is going to challenge them?

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.599
They’ll kill me if I tell them that, but
it’s a fact.

01:12:59.599 --> 01:13:07.020
This is not what is going to happen to you.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.099
What Christ has said [is] “Your hands will
speak."

01:13:11.099 --> 01:13:16.990
Even Mohammed Sahib has said more about the
day of resurrection.

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:24.740
He didn’t talk of the day of death first,
of the complete destruction first, he talked

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.930
more about the day of resurrection.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:27.930
Christ also [about] the day of judgement.

01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:30.619
They did not talk of the death.

01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:37.399
While there are people sitting around and
thinking, “Now when will that day come when

01:13:37.399 --> 01:13:39.119
we’ll all be finished?”

01:13:39.119 --> 01:13:40.119
Imagine!

01:13:40.119 --> 01:13:44.359
We have reached that state of confusion that
we are waiting for a complete destruction,

01:13:44.359 --> 01:13:48.149
trying to celebrate it, the way people are
anxious about it.

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:53.790
First of all, you all have to enter into the
Kingdom of God – that’s the place for

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:54.790
you.

01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:55.790
That’s the place to enjoy.

01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:57.149
That’s the place God has made.

01:13:57.149 --> 01:14:05.810
He has not made you a human being to suffer
and suffer and die in suffering, then we have

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:07.010
never understood Him.

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:09.460
He is the Father of compassion.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.550
He is the ocean of love, an ocean of forgiveness.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:18.570
We have forgotten, what His nature is.

01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:22.970
And we really misunderstand that he has made
us to suffer.

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:27.680
This is really absolutely [an] anti-God idea,
I think, and I just can’t understand how

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.899
can we really gulp it down.

01:14:29.899 --> 01:14:34.119
It’s too much, to believe that God will
make you suffer.

01:14:34.119 --> 01:14:36.790
Or [that] Kundalini makes you suffer is another
worse idea.

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.010
She is your Mother.

01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:39.530
She has been with you.

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:40.750
She has been waiting.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:42.190
She is your own mother.

01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:43.970
Everybody has an individual Mother.

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:52.339
She has been waiting for this day to give
you Realisation, is she going to make you

01:14:52.339 --> 01:14:53.339
suffer?

01:14:53.339 --> 01:14:54.339
May God bless you all.

01:14:54.339 --> 01:14:57.490
I’m very happy to be back, and I hope you’ll
have more people next time and I’ll be able

01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:59.250
to come back again.

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:13.300
If you have any problems, any questions, you
may ask me.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:21.530
Seeker: You said on the radio interview today,
that you were destined to become what you

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:24.190
are today.

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:27.310
Are we also destined?

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:29.680
Shri Mataji: You have hit the point.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.060
That’s it!

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.139
Absolutely, that’s it!

01:15:33.139 --> 01:15:36.830
You are all destined to come and get Realisation
— absolutely that’s it!

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:44.720
Otherwise, do you think am I mad to go about?

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.880
Have you ever known so many seekers in this
world?

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.060
Not only destined, but [with] deliberations.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:16:00.970
You have deliberately taken birth in those
days to get your Realisation, and to do the

01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:07.320
work of God, and to enjoy the bliss of God.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.589
It’s a deliberate action on your part.

01:16:10.589 --> 01:16:13.980
Destination is of course there, but deliberations
are there [too].

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:20.220
You have to be all very special people to
do that, no doubt.

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:26.099
That’s a quality, that’s a quality: everybody
doesn’t have that quality.

01:16:26.099 --> 01:16:29.139
That’s a quality of people, and only such
people can stick on.

01:16:29.139 --> 01:16:36.480
I couldn’t tell this to our mayor, that
it’s a quality that is lacking.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.520
It’s a quality.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.090
They just know that — this is the truth.

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:43.609
Seeker: Isn’t possible to abuse the Kundalini?

01:16:43.609 --> 01:16:46.359
Shri Mataji: No, never, never, never, never!

01:16:46.359 --> 01:16:47.359
You cannot, never.

01:16:47.359 --> 01:16:48.359
Seeker: But can you awaken it through the
wrong channel?

01:16:48.359 --> 01:16:49.609
Shri Mataji: You cannot do it.

01:16:49.609 --> 01:16:52.130
You cannot do it.

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:53.609
You just cannot.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.010
It’s the wisdom.

01:16:55.010 --> 01:17:00.820
Kundalini is awakened only by the permission
of a Deity which is wisdom.

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.490
You can never misuse it.

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:04.869
You can never sell it.

01:17:04.869 --> 01:17:07.159
I’ll give you an example.

01:17:07.159 --> 01:17:14.480
There was a gentleman, an Indian, whom I gave
Realisation in America, who started his own

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.480
organisation.

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.420
As usual Indians are very good at making money.

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.230
Put them anywhere, they’ll make money.

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:24.210
This fellow, first he behaved all right, and
then he started his organisation and all that

01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:27.460
and he wrote to me, “I am doing this Sahaja
Yoga, I am doing this, and I’ve got lots

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:28.460
of people coming."

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.050
He put a fees and all that.

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:32.310
I didn’t know how he was running it.

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:35.899
Of course, you can charge for the food all
right, you can charge for your stay.

01:17:35.899 --> 01:17:40.260
But when he came — the people in Bombay
are very sensitive — they told me, “Mother,

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:41.260
we are fainting with this man!

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.260
What’s the matter with him?

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.440
We are all feeling giddy."

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.190
I said, “Don’t you worry.

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:46.190
I’ll find out."

01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:50.909
When he came, I said, “Can I have a look
at your brochure?”

01:17:50.909 --> 01:17:54.720
In the brochure, he had written, “For vibrations,
ordinary, $125.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.870
For special ones $280!”

01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:56.870
I said, “Sir why this?”

01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:57.870
He said, “Mother how am I to live?”

01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:00.320
I said, “What were you doing?”

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.860
He said, “I was a teacher."

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:08.590
I said, “You go ahead with your teaching.

01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:12.220
How much money did you pay me to get your
vibrations that you put this kind of a thing

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.220
there?”

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.079
He said, “But how am I going to live?”

01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:17.440
And he got into a temper, and he became very
red.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.040
Now, “I can talk to you about it.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.520
You cannot take any money for it."

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.520
So he got very angry.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.480
He said, “I am going to see one Guru."

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.490
I said, “Go and see him!”

01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.599
This is a guru living in Calicut (Kozhikode).

01:18:30.599 --> 01:18:33.500
Actually I have never met him.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.869
But this fellow, when he came back, he telephoned
to me.

01:18:36.869 --> 01:18:39.010
He said, “Mother please forgive me, please
forgive me, please forgive me."

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:40.010
I said, “What happened?”

01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:45.320
He telephoned, and on the telephone he said,
“I must tell you all of what happened."

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.320
I said, “What happened?”

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.329
He said, “I went there, and when I reached
the gate, this guru was sitting in a hut,

01:18:50.329 --> 01:18:54.880
and he started throwing stones at me: one
after another, so many stones he threw that

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.829
I just sat down there.

01:18:56.829 --> 01:18:58.629
He said, “What do you mean?

01:18:58.629 --> 01:19:03.120
You have said those things to Mother and you
think I will give you some blessings here?

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.220
These are my blessings, go ahead!”

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:13.890
And poor fellow, he went back: he went and
sat in the station, on the platform.

01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:18.070
And one of this guru’s persons went and
said that, “What did you say to Mother?

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:22.340
He knows that Mother is there, and how dare
you say something to Mother?”

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:26.170
He said, “Because I was making money and
she was angry with me, and this."

01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:29.520
He said, “You better go and ask for forgiveness!”

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:34.159
For three days, he stayed on the platform
and on the fourth day the guru sent for him

01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:35.159
[and] he came.

01:19:35.159 --> 01:19:38.270
And then he said a Sanskrit shloka in my praise
and all that.

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:39.960
He said, “Just go and read it out to Mother,
that’s all."

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.000
So he brought that and read it on the phone.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.320
But somehow he could not meet me.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.560
He tried his level best but he just could
not meet me.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.159
And he read that to me.

01:19:51.159 --> 01:19:54.750
But when this guru, I told him that, “Why
don’t you go to America, because this year

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.260
I won’t be able to go?”

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:59.860
He went to New York, he was there for three
days and he went back.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.849
He said, “They are all mad people!

01:20:01.849 --> 01:20:02.849
They are dollar-mad!

01:20:02.849 --> 01:20:03.849
I can’t stay there.

01:20:03.849 --> 01:20:04.849
They were offering me dollars for everything."

01:20:04.849 --> 01:20:05.849
So he ran back!

01:20:05.849 --> 01:20:06.869
He couldn’t stay there.

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:08.349
So there are realised-souls.

01:20:08.349 --> 01:20:11.950
There are people who know about Sahaja Yoga.

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:14.590
But they know that you cannot sell it.

01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:20.720
If you try to do anything like that — finished
— you will lose your vibrations immediately.

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.680
They are very sensitive, very sensitive.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.210
If you are ignorant, then it’s all right,
they will stay.

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:31.800
But knowingly if you do something, just they’ll
disappear.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.290
And you won’t like it, because when they
are flowing you are enjoying yourself, and

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:38.240
you just stop [enjoying].

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:50.149
Those who don’t know anything about Kundalini,
they say the Kundalini is in the stomach,

01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:53.089
this, that — they are not authorised people,
they try to play tricks with Kundalini — they

01:20:53.089 --> 01:20:54.129
get into trouble.

01:20:54.129 --> 01:20:59.109
Because it’s not the Kundalini, because
She is the Mother, but the Deity, the Deity

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:03.450
that is Christ actually in another form called
Ganesha is sitting down there.

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:08.159
He hits them hard onto the sympathetic, and
that’s how they get it, all the problems.

01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:12.250
Seeker: So how do other gurus raise the Kundalini?

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:15.500
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am going to do.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.329
Once I have done it, then you will do.

01:21:17.329 --> 01:21:20.310
First an enlightened light must enlighten
you.

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:23.500
Once you are enlightened, you enlighten other
people.

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:29.050
Dr Warren: He said, how do other gurus raise
the Kundalini?

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:32.350
Shri Mataji: Which one?

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:33.450
Which one?

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:35.649
Let’s have him out.

01:21:35.649 --> 01:21:38.940
I will send half of them to them.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:39.940
Who is the one?

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.389
They just talk.

01:21:41.389 --> 01:21:44.690
Seeker: Swami Muktananda is quite popular.

01:21:44.690 --> 01:21:47.889
Shri Mataji: You think he’s raising Kundalini
or he’s putting bhoots?

01:21:47.889 --> 01:21:49.290
He is putting possessions!

01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:51.260
They just dance, dance, dance.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.570
Anybody can dance, what is so great?

01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:58.480
Anybody can dance, what is there so great
in dancing?

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.000
Is there?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.839
But Kundalini you can see with your naked
eyes, the pulsation, the rising and the cool

01:22:04.839 --> 01:22:07.609
breeze coming out of your head.

01:22:07.609 --> 01:22:08.770
That’s what it is.

01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:10.840
It’s not dancing: even Rajneesh does that!

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840
He even takes out your clothes!

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840
All right?

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:17.639
But this Muktanand is a funny fellow I must
say.

01:22:17.639 --> 01:22:24.089
Horrible fellow he spoils the Kundalini so
badly!

01:22:24.089 --> 01:22:26.200
The other day one fellow came, who was with
him for sixteen years, can you imagine?

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.899
He’s good for nothing now!

01:22:28.899 --> 01:22:31.600
How to give him Realisation?

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.380
He’s spent all his money, everything.

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.879
He has become so useless.

01:22:34.879 --> 01:22:38.839
And then he says now, “Now I feel I am mentally
also good for nothing."

01:22:38.839 --> 01:22:43.480
I sent him to Australia, that fellow.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.480
I am sorry!

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.420
I didn’t mean you, I did not mean you.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:49.649
I sent him to Australia because he was going
to Australia, I said all right, you go and

01:22:49.649 --> 01:22:50.649
see these people.

01:22:50.649 --> 01:22:52.599
But a headache, I tell you.

01:22:52.599 --> 01:22:55.170
He’s good for nothing, this fellow!

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:59.030
I know his names in his previous lives (Muktanand).

01:22:59.030 --> 01:23:00.310
But very difficult.

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:01.310
Horrible!

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:09.250
They
not only want to make money: it’s all right,

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:12.149
there are thugs, there are smugglers, all
right, I don’t mind.

01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:14.330
But they’ll spoil your chances of Realisation.

01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:16.000
They are anti-God.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.040
That’s the point is!

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.730
The Kundalini just doesn’t rise in people
who go to Muktanand — rather difficult.

01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:25.020
Don’t be frightened, if you have been, I’ll
manage it.

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:28.300
It can be worked out.

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:34.399
But when you will meet somebody Muktanandi,
you will know: you will run away from that

01:23:34.399 --> 01:23:36.240
person then, because the hands break!

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.820
You get tired.

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:41.790
The Kundalini is tired, poor thing: She hits
her head, this side, that side.

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:51.180
I don’t know what he does: horrible, cruel
man.

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:56.640
One better than the other, this Muktanand.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.520
Can’t you see on his face?

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.750
What does he talk?

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:02.750
All nonsense!

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:04.540
Very easy to make out.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:09.270
He puts the Kundalini in such a way that the
Void is completely finished!

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:14.580
The crossing point, that Void, is so much
obstructed that the Kundalini doesn’t get

01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:17.199
out of that, it just wobbles there only.

01:24:17.199 --> 01:24:22.899
Well, we’ll work it out, all right?

01:24:22.899 --> 01:24:25.490
We’ll work it out.

01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:30.930
You are seekers, you are seekers.

01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:33.930
You are God’s own people.

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:35.410
And you are to be saved.

01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:36.410
So let these horrible people delude you.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:37.410
How long will they go on?

01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:39.140
All of them have to perish one by one, you
will see that.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:45.350
The best part of it [is] that all untruth
fails, ultimately.

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:50.670
Seeker: How do you actually tell a true guru?

01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:53.230
Shri Mataji: After Realisation it’s very
easy.

01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:55.230
But you can tell.

01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:58.620
For example, can’t you say who is a sincere
person?

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:02.060
You can, if you don’t get into the circus.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.550
It’s simple.

01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:13.690
But a true guru will not be worried about
your purse, as to how much money you have

01:25:13.690 --> 01:25:14.690
got.

01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:15.690
And he will give you your own powers.

01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:21.230
He’ll not try to show off his own powers,
talk about his own powers, “I am this, I

01:25:21.230 --> 01:25:22.589
am that,” nothing.

01:25:22.589 --> 01:25:26.180
Unless and until the Kundalini is risen and
you have got Self-realisation, nobody will

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:30.330
give you false certificate that Kundalini
is awakened.

01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:32.400
It has to manifested.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.070
It’s all falsehood: [from] a to z, it is
false.

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:40.480
Supposing for example that somebody’s Kundalini
doesn’t rise — all right, it does not

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.480
rise.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.310
My own daughters are not realised-souls, what
can I do about it?

01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:47.390
My own daughters are not realised-souls.

01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:49.400
But my grandchildren are.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.090
So what can I do?

01:25:51.090 --> 01:25:53.029
I cannot force on them.

01:25:53.029 --> 01:25:58.009
If it is not, it is not.

01:25:58.009 --> 01:25:59.630
You cannot give a false certificate.

01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:05.920
It has to happen.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.259
Seeker: Isn’t it hard to combine Christian
and Hindu concepts?

01:26:10.259 --> 01:26:11.279
Shri Mataji: No, no, it is the easiest.

01:26:11.279 --> 01:26:12.910
They are just the same, my child.

01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:14.029
They are just the same.

01:26:14.029 --> 01:26:16.460
There is no difference at all.

01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.080
They are all one.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:24.820
Christ has said, “Those who are not against
me are with me."

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:27.300
Who are they?

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.380
They are all one.

01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:31.430
There is no difference at all.

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:32.449
You’ll find it.

01:26:32.449 --> 01:26:38.680
At different stages they came on this Earth
to give us a new dimension, all of them.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.570
Like on a tree, we have different flowers
at different times, but they all come from

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:45.360
the same source, don’t they?

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.719
Now they pluck the flower, “This is my flower,”
“This is my flower."

01:26:48.719 --> 01:26:53.279
That’s not, that’s a dead flower.

01:26:53.279 --> 01:26:57.850
The same energy produces the same flowers.

01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:59.540
But they fight.

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:07.610
You will be surprised, if I tell you the whole
history of the relationship between them:

01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:16.580
between Christ and Krishna, between Mohammed
and Christ, and Krishna, there’s a big relationship.

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:25.170
They are all related to each other, very closely,
which you’ll find out in Kundalini also.

01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:30.560
It’s very interesting how they are related,
now they have played the game.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:34.250
And they are all settled down within us: all
brothers sisters, husband-wife; all sorts

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.759
of relationship they have.

01:27:35.759 --> 01:27:42.529
It’s very interesting to see, but it is
not only a story but you can see it yourself,

01:27:42.529 --> 01:27:46.820
that they are within you.

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:54.270
Say for example if I say that Mohammed Sahib
was the same as Nanak, Guru Nanak.

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:56.730
Imagine the Sikhs are breaking the neck of
Muslims, and Muslims are breaking the heads

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:59.260
of the Sikhs.

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:06.210
It’s a big quarrel going on.

01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:14.330
But Nanak came after Mohammed, to teach Muslim-Hindu
unity.

01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:17.580
Because he was surprised the way Muslims are.

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:21.020
But they are one!

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:25.469
They are one personality, born again and again.

01:28:25.469 --> 01:28:30.390
Moses, Abraham, Socrates: all of them are
the same.

01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:37.779
Now if a Muslim is a fanatic, he gets a cancer.

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:41.410
Normally he should, or he becomes a dry personality.

01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:43.700
Imagine Khomeini.

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.810
They become a dry personality.

01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:48.730
They can be very violent people.

01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:50.790
But supposing they get into trouble, like
cancer.

01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:56.750
I had one Muslim coming from Iran, who was
a fanatic, he got cancer.

01:28:56.750 --> 01:29:00.630
I said, “You think that Mohammed Sahib is
the only person?”

01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:01.630
“Yes,” he said.

01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:04.100
“But if I say, Guru Nanak was the same."

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.259
“I can’t believe it."

01:29:05.259 --> 01:29:06.259
I said, “Then I can’t cure you.

01:29:06.259 --> 01:29:10.400
You have to accept, because Mohammed Sahib
himself is against you, because he came in

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.400
ten forms."

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.270
And he wouldn’t accept it.

01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:17.500
But his wife prevailed upon him because he
was very sick.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.850
And he got cured.

01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:22.320
That’s how you have to prove.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.850
Human beings cannot easily understand.

01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:28.199
You see, if you are born in a Christian religion,
you become a Christian.

01:29:28.199 --> 01:29:31.270
It’s a horrible thing like that!

01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:37.800
You are all human beings, and all this people
have come on this Earth to give you a new

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.800
dimension.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.160
Only we don’t understand them.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.820
They never came to make us fanatics.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:49.330
That at least ,that is too much to see.

01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:54.450
After Realisation, you will know that they
are all in complete unison, complete concord,

01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:59.430
that’s not possible on human level: absolute
complete concord.

01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:02.910
Yes, it’s a fact!

01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:08.500
All right, should we have Realisation now,
let us try.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:15.810
Because I have to go now to London, and tomorrow
is another very heavy day.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:21.840
Please put your hands.
