1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:18,300
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,920
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,340
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,320
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:49,480
However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

6
00:00:50,020 --> 00:01:00,600
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:25,700
and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

8
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:40,460
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

9
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,220
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

10
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,360
A small boy who came into the world and did such great work!

11
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:05,000
He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active.

12
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:23,100
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:47,940
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

14
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:58,760
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything, but you cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:08,900
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is. Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

16
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:19,540
When He is awakened within us, then we have no questions left.

17
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,700
Then we are successful, in whichever task
we undertake.We find joy in everything we do.

18
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:40,000
He is the embodiment of joy and gives joy to everyone.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

20
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:55,540
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

21
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,240
This pleases Him very much.

22
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:13,180
Such an embodiment of love, such a pure-hearted

23
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Shri Ganesha was born today.

24
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,480
This is the importance of this day.

25
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:33,660
Today if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it.

26
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:45,380
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

27
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:53,300
Ask Him with all your heart and He will help you

28
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,480
in every way, every moment, every instant.

29
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,380
Today is a very big day,

30
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,040
because the actual
pure spirit has taken birth today.

31
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:28,160
And He already had such an eternal state,
that many people could not comprehend it

32
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
or write about it.

33
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,760
They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand

34
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,700
that by the power of Shri Ganesha’s name
you can get your realization.

35
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:53,000
By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear.

36
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:00,420
He is eternal.

37
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:11,180
He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him.

38
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,440
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him.

39
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:27,860
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

40
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:44,800
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings you can
do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will you have any problems.

41
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:53,120
Because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

42
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,700
Though He is a little boy, He looks after
you.

43
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,840
Shri Ganesha is a very great power by which so much work is getting done.

44
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,300
For Me, He is the purest and My own.

45
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:23,840
I trouble Him a lot, when somebody tries to trouble Me, I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him all right.

46
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:35,640
When this fellow is unmanageable for Me, when
there is a difficult person and it is possible

47
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,860
for Me to handle him, then He does the job.

48
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:52,000
So today’s day is very auspicious as today
He is born.

49
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,920
Secondly today is Panchami (the Fifth Day).

50
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:12,480
This Panchami is recognized because on this day we wear a dress,

51
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:21,960
whatever we wear today is so that our body is properly covered.

52
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:39,640
The sense of shame and chastity that our body
has is because of Him.

53
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,120
Lajja Rupena Samstitha.

54
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:54,220
So if you have any sense of chastity and shame, it is because of Him.

55
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,740
That will benefit you immensely.

56
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,760
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

57
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,040
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases,

58
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,380
you become joyous, because He is the personification.

59
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:31,260
Because of this, both things are today, His
birthday and His help.

60
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:42,560
We take His help in any work what we do.
Such is our way. In that direction our attention does not go.

61
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:52,600
But we don't see what we have to do to awaken Him.

62
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,480
We do not feel that we should become like
Him, that we should have a state in which

63
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:07,200
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us.

64
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,320
With which we may never venture on the wrong path.

65
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,720
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special,

66
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:27,620
they despise all the wrong things in this
world and they do not do anything wrong

67
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,500
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

68
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,400
They cannot enjoy any wrong activities.

69
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,180
This is Shri Ganesha's great blessing that
you have come into such a joyous life.

70
00:10:42,420 --> 00:11:02,120
So today in His service you sing His praise
and glory, so that He may be pleased.

71
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,200
My Eternal Blessings to all of you.

72
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,690
 

73
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:28,720
 

74
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:38,370
