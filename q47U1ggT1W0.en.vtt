WEBVTT

00:00.159 --> 00:05.297
Earlier I have told you about origin.

00:06.602 --> 00:10.843
Because on the day of Maha Shivratri

00:12.153 --> 00:15.240
when we want to talk about Shivji

00:15.265 --> 00:18.528
its beginning starts with its origin.

00:18.713 --> 00:32.991
How much He is the origin, that means God's first form.

00:35.142 --> 00:39.344
It gets manifested

00:39.737 --> 00:46.513
when He gets lighted by Bramha.

00:48.173 --> 00:51.164
At that time He is called Sadashiva.

00:53.076 --> 00:57.135
That is why Shivji is known as the beginning.

00:58.458 --> 01:02.286
Just try to understand like this

01:02.311 --> 01:09.822
that to a tree before its complete manifestation

01:10.386 --> 01:15.743
its seed is examined

01:15.950 --> 01:17.364
and for the same reason

01:17.389 --> 01:20.194
it should be called BIJASWAROOP ( the form of the seed).

01:20.845 --> 01:27.059
That is why there is a great importance of Shivji.

01:29.758 --> 01:36.847
After that, after His manifestation within His ownself

01:37.776 --> 01:44.673
Shakti comes in Her own form and is known as Adishakti.

01:47.712 --> 01:57.338
Same Adishakti enlightens individually all the three forms of God

01:57.363 --> 01:59.710
which you know

02:00.028 --> 02:04.351
whose name is Bramha, Vishnu and Mahesh means is Shiv Shankar.

02:05.149 --> 02:08.355
That means three aspects of one diomand

02:08.514 --> 02:16.012
Adishakti filters

02:17.922 --> 02:25.399
and when on Doomsday, the whole creation

02:25.424 --> 02:31.880
the whole manifested world is immersed

02:31.905 --> 02:34.903
merges with the same Bramha

02:35.928 --> 02:40.931
even then Sadashiva is present there

02:42.045 --> 02:44.790
and His connection

02:46.691 --> 02:51.137
continues with that part of God

02:51.162 --> 02:53.791
which is never manifested

02:54.530 --> 02:57.882
which is a non- being.

02:57.907 --> 03:08.168
God's powers that manifest, come out of His Being

03:08.732 --> 03:12.783
and those which do not manifest, always remain as non being.

03:13.085 --> 03:16.926
In that Sadashiva's place

03:18.426 --> 03:25.133
is like a diamond which may break, get splitted

03:25.158 --> 03:30.054
however much it may get smashed , break into small particles

03:30.546 --> 03:33.612
still it goes on shining.

03:34.954 --> 03:40.088
It's shine never gets destroyed.

03:40.113 --> 03:44.322
This is what Sada Shiv’s state is.

03:46.124 --> 03:51.093
A state (STHITI) is created because of Sada Shiva

03:51.118 --> 03:55.589
and in the creation of the world

03:56.883 --> 04:02.418
unless there is a situation there can be no creation.

04:03.113 --> 04:06.198
First of all, a situation is created.

04:06.223 --> 04:09.857
Existence of anything is to be brought about.

04:10.362 --> 04:17.560
Existence is caused because of the power of Sadashiva.

04:20.431 --> 04:29.992
That is why, His role in creation is the same

04:30.017 --> 04:38.953
as that of foundation of a massive building.

04:38.986 --> 04:46.144
Foundation cannot be seen

04:46.169 --> 04:51.499
but without that no building can be erected.

04:52.462 --> 04:56.058
In the same way, Sadashiva inside our being

04:56.083 --> 05:00.228
resides in our heart and takes the form of spirit.

05:00.514 --> 05:04.572
Till He is in  the form of spirit in our heart

05:04.775 --> 05:10.623
till then only our life in this world continues.

05:10.648 --> 05:15.976
The day He closes His eyes, the same day we cease to exist.

05:16.651 --> 05:23.487
We leave this world and our state goes to PARLOK (another world).

05:24.780 --> 05:34.654
Shivji, you know resides in our Moon Channel.

05:35.703 --> 05:40.529
and residing in our Moon channel

05:40.554 --> 05:45.379
He does His work of maintaing its STHITI (state) within us.

05:45.922 --> 05:56.020
But He also maintains the state of our PRANA (life).

05:57.716 --> 06:01.333
Without Shivji our life cannot continue.

06:01.358 --> 06:04.371
There is a detailed description of it

06:04.396 --> 06:06.997
which I have mentioned in detail in My book.

06:08.135 --> 06:14.257
Shivji's form is that He is a great Saint.

06:16.155 --> 06:20.452
For example, God's form is that He is a saint from within

06:24.880 --> 06:27.513
He doesn't have any reason to do it He does it.

06:27.577 --> 06:30.581
He does it because of His whim, for His joy.

06:30.606 --> 06:33.742
If He wants, He creates, otherwise He destroys.

06:36.506 --> 06:41.922
An ascetic

06:41.947 --> 06:49.021
who dewells in this world, is His symbol.

06:49.279 --> 06:51.284
By ascetism

06:51.309 --> 06:53.619
I do not mean the way it is understood in the world

06:53.644 --> 06:54.978
all of you know that.

06:55.005 --> 06:56.644
An ascetic should be called he

06:56.669 --> 06:58.831
who after getting self realization

06:58.856 --> 07:02.110
has reached a stage where he is in a witness state.

07:02.135 --> 07:04.265
Inside he is an ascetic

07:04.290 --> 07:07.294
but outwardly even while living in the whole world

07:07.319 --> 07:08.329
he is a great saint.

07:10.052 --> 07:13.441
He doesn't have the need to tell anyone that he is a saint

07:14.104 --> 07:16.103
i have adopted ascetism

07:18.352 --> 07:23.195
but the spirit inside us that takes to ascetism inside us.

07:23.220 --> 07:28.985
One who gets ascetic from inside that state is of Shree Shiva.

07:29.104 --> 07:32.449
and the world in which we dewell

07:32.474 --> 07:35.227
and the task of the world that we do

07:35.756 --> 07:38.572
and whatever we enjoy in the world

07:39.144 --> 07:43.092
that enjoyment form of the God Almightly

07:43.117 --> 07:46.175
is that of Shree Vishnu's form.

07:47.093 --> 07:49.739
That’s why in the form of Vishnu, He is the enjoyer

07:50.097 --> 07:53.235
in the form of Shivji, He is an ascetic

07:53.260 --> 08:00.272
and in the form of Brahma, He is the creator that creates.

08:03.339 --> 08:06.546
Looking at this ascetic

08:06.571 --> 08:14.722
one sees this strange thing that His body is blue in colour.

08:18.088 --> 08:21.900
Because He is sitting on the line of ‘CHANDRAMA (moon)

08:21.925 --> 08:28.556
there are snakes around His neck and arms.

08:29.851 --> 08:34.687
His whole decoration is with snakes.

08:35.783 --> 08:43.030
Snakes are cooling and peaceful. They consume heat.

08:44.498 --> 08:47.081
He keeps all these snakes on his body

08:47.106 --> 08:50.295
symbolising that all the wicked

08:50.351 --> 08:53.424
horrible, poisonous

08:53.449 --> 08:57.122
and powerful things that are there to destroy this

08:57.191 --> 08:59.547
holding them all in His being.

09:01.435 --> 09:05.022
He drunk all the poison of the world.

09:05.047 --> 09:10.270
You already know that He drank all the poison in the beginning only

09:10.295 --> 09:13.650
and whatever poison of the world is there

09:13.675 --> 09:17.196
He consumes inside His being and keeps the world cool

09:18.323 --> 09:20.787
to give joy to the creation.

09:20.812 --> 09:25.622
Whatever dies or comes to an end

09:25.647 --> 09:31.358
goes and settles down in His kingdom

09:31.579 --> 09:35.257
and all the useless and the evil people's

09:35.669 --> 09:40.609
prisons are shut down by the dust of His feet.

09:41.564 --> 09:47.477
They are controlled by the grateness of Shivji.

09:50.115 --> 09:53.693
Chandrama (Moon) resides on His head.

09:53.718 --> 09:58.469
Chandrama is the brother of Laxmi

09:58.494 --> 10:00.695
and that is why it is said that

10:00.720 --> 10:03.993
He has put His brother in law on His head.

10:06.017 --> 10:13.777
There is a strange description of Him by the poets.

10:13.959 --> 10:15.602
and very beautiful

10:19.182 --> 10:24.170
and a big load of Ganga on His head.

10:24.195 --> 10:27.379
Means as if He is about to remove pride of all human beings.

10:27.404 --> 10:31.749
He has tied even the proud Ganga in His dreadlocks.

10:31.774 --> 10:35.555
His dreadlocks are so tremendous.

10:35.939 --> 10:41.133
He sucks away all the ego of human beings

10:41.158 --> 10:47.217
and this way He protects the people from egoistical people.

10:48.950 --> 10:53.563
He is incomparable, He can’t be described in words.

10:53.588 --> 11:02.258
But He has a very remarkable, extraordinary power

11:03.209 --> 11:07.635
which no other God has and that is the power of forgiveness.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.957
He can forgive even the most evil person.

11:13.452 --> 11:17.448
Those who can’t be forgiven even by

11:17.473 --> 11:20.412
Shree Ganesh or YESHU MASIH (Jesus Christ)

11:20.437 --> 11:24.132
Sada Shiva can forgive even them.

11:24.172 --> 11:31.215
That is why whenever we have to ask for forgiveness

11:32.633 --> 11:37.723
we have to ask Him for forgiveness.

11:42.207 --> 11:47.870
Because there are certain things for which Ganesha can never forgive.

11:48.117 --> 11:53.817
which we say sin against Mother

11:53.842 --> 11:58.721
Shree Ganesha can never forgive all sex related sins.

11:58.746 --> 12:02.671
It is very difficult to pacify Shree Ganesha.

12:02.696 --> 12:04.682
Jesus Christ also can never forgive

12:04.707 --> 12:06.667
He can never forgive.

12:06.692 --> 12:16.091
Only Mahadev, Shiv Shankar is capable of forgiving such sins.

12:16.116 --> 12:19.548
Even these two can’t understand Him.

12:22.111 --> 12:25.884
So, we should worship Him.

12:26.698 --> 12:31.986
It is so surprising, why do people fast on the day of Mahashivratri?

12:32.011 --> 12:39.463
I can't understand that on which basis this custom was created.

12:39.513 --> 12:41.023
May be some crooked people

12:41.048 --> 12:43.863
have written this in the SHASTRAS (old religious texts).

12:43.888 --> 12:47.137
On this day, he drank poison.

12:49.892 --> 12:54.443
Today you are also allowed to eat anything

12:54.468 --> 12:56.288
even if you take poison today.

12:56.701 --> 13:00.558
You have decided to fast today.

13:03.046 --> 13:05.960
I can feel such a strain on my heart chakra today

13:05.985 --> 13:07.868
any Sahaj yogi who has fasted today

13:07.893 --> 13:09.674
is straining my heart chakra today.

13:11.488 --> 13:13.999
Sahaj yogis should not act blindly.

13:14.024 --> 13:18.147
They should think that the great day of celebration

13:18.338 --> 13:21.830
He who conquered the world by taking poison

13:21.855 --> 13:26.262
when there is such a great festival of that Shivji

13:26.287 --> 13:29.488
who has said that one should starve to death that day.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.023
The day a person is happy he takes more food than normal

13:32.048 --> 13:34.265
Today it is the day of taking two loaves more

13:34.361 --> 13:37.464
Today everybody is fasting.

13:39.217 --> 13:42.895
That is why Shivji is angry with everyone

13:44.999 --> 13:47.632
and for this even Shivji cannot forgive.

13:47.657 --> 13:49.925
So how can you be blissful?

13:49.950 --> 13:54.477
That’s why all these big devotees of Shiva, get heart attacks first.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.907
Today it it is the day to rejoice

13:59.932 --> 14:05.466
that He drank all the poison of the world.

14:05.911 --> 14:11.067
All that was not benevolent, all the sins

14:11.092 --> 14:16.222
all the evil that was spread in the world, he sucked it all.

14:16.247 --> 14:19.914
On such a day of this great festival of Shivji

14:19.939 --> 14:23.341
we should not do something so inauspicious.

14:23.366 --> 14:26.976
If we fast on the day of someone’s birthday

14:27.001 --> 14:29.790
so shall we eat on the day he dies?

14:32.140 --> 14:34.438
All this reverse business happens here.

14:34.463 --> 14:38.041
When someone dies, all the Brahmins sit down and eat.

14:38.875 --> 14:43.330
When someone is born, all the family sit down and fast.

14:44.505 --> 14:45.937
How can this be explained?

14:45.962 --> 14:48.706
Which SHASTRA says so?

14:48.731 --> 14:50.329
Even in the SHASTRAS (Holy books)

14:50.354 --> 14:53.643
the idiotic people have filled in such things.

14:55.901 --> 14:57.266
Wherever you see

14:57.291 --> 14:58.673
in their religious texts

14:58.753 --> 15:01.423
they have filled all sorts of wrong stuff.

15:01.448 --> 15:03.293
After much deliberation one must see

15:03.318 --> 15:06.079
what is the sense behind fasting today?

15:10.102 --> 15:11.749
Everyone should eat sweets

15:11.774 --> 15:18.042
because in the temples everyone wants to eat sweets.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.349
So sweets should be offered.

15:19.374 --> 15:20.384
Now throughout the night

15:20.409 --> 15:22.487
they will consume BHANG (an intoxicating drink)

15:22.512 --> 15:26.419
will consume CHARAS and then they will say Shivji used to take it

15:26.444 --> 15:29.047
so we are also having CHARAS and BHANG.

15:29.072 --> 15:32.417
Shiv ji consumes CHARAS and BHANG  (intoxicating drinks).

15:32.442 --> 15:37.775
because when He has to go into subconscious He consumes it.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.971
He may consume anything, how is anyone concerned with that.

15:41.331 --> 15:46.203
For example, if there is an aeroplane and you have to go somewhere

15:46.228 --> 15:48.639
then you have to be a pilot first.

15:48.664 --> 15:51.579
Those who have consumed BHANG or CHARAS

15:51.604 --> 15:52.626
can’t become Shiv ji.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.102
It is Shivji only who has drunk the poison from the world

15:55.127 --> 16:00.160
bhang from all over the world and is consuming it

16:00.185 --> 16:02.824
otherwise, where else can it dumped?

16:04.998 --> 16:06.811
All these things were filled inside Him

16:06.836 --> 16:08.797
because you are verily the STHITI (state)

16:08.822 --> 16:10.303
you drink poison, you take BHANG (an intoxicating drink).

16:10.351 --> 16:12.912
Now everyone is trying to copy Him by drinking BHANG.

16:12.937 --> 16:15.036
Do you think that you are becoming Shivji by drinking BHANG?

16:16.703 --> 16:20.666
How many of you here are even worth the dust of Shiv ji’s feet?

16:24.143 --> 16:28.854
He drinks it because it is all stored inside Him.

16:28.829 --> 16:31.074
There is BHANG in this world.

16:31.099 --> 16:33.151
RAKHSHASAS (demons) and evil people also.

16:33.176 --> 16:35.447
Where can they be kept? Inside the house?

16:35.709 --> 16:37.463
If you have something like this

16:37.488 --> 16:39.953
you must have arrangements to store it also.

16:39.978 --> 16:43.528
Shivji said ‘ ok bring me, I will drink the poison of the world’.

16:45.236 --> 16:49.263
That is why these things are stored inside Him.

16:52.382 --> 16:57.097
You people, who are consuming CHARAS and BHANG in His name

16:57.122 --> 17:01.321
there are no greater fools in this world than yourselves.

17:03.966 --> 17:09.382
Sahaj yogis should think that you had never felt vibrations till now.

17:09.453 --> 17:11.836
You don’t know what this thing is?

17:12.019 --> 17:18.094
very new, tremendous and remarkable.

17:22.673 --> 17:30.132
Then you should change your thoughts and habits as well.

17:32.303 --> 17:35.352
Why do we always speak the opposite of what it should be

17:35.377 --> 17:36.658
I don't understand

17:37.682 --> 17:47.634
and with every such thing, Shivji will leave this world

17:48.356 --> 17:51.217
and then it will be very difficult to make settle down

17:51.242 --> 17:53.414
and if he stays standing for too long

17:53.439 --> 17:54.443
He will start His TANDAV (dance of destruction).

17:54.555 --> 17:56.324
He is unpredictable.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.652
So you should be thoughtful of this.

18:02.677 --> 18:07.250
Today is His very great day.

18:07.275 --> 18:09.341
You must promise ME today

18:09.366 --> 18:13.746
that the next Shivratri will be a huge celebration.

18:14.077 --> 18:16.381
He will be praised.

18:17.940 --> 18:22.322
May be He doesn’t like ornaments like Vishnu ji.

18:22.347 --> 18:27.040
He has different decorations. Get BABHOOT (ash) for him.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.664
You can offer him ashes from across the world.

18:30.689 --> 18:34.286
He is ready for all this.

18:34.508 --> 18:40.614
But if he has mentioned fasting, then I am not aware of this.

18:40.864 --> 18:45.645
The word VRAT (fast) has changed. It now has become fasting.

18:48.018 --> 18:50.465
You should fast when, for example

18:50.490 --> 18:54.620
when Shri Ram Chandra ji went to exile in the forests

18:54.645 --> 18:59.249
When there is repentance, then it is understandable.

18:59.274 --> 19:03.080
Are you repenting that He (SHIVJI) has drunk all poison?

19:06.541 --> 19:10.052
One must think.

19:10.077 --> 19:13.000
All the hardships of the world

19:13.025 --> 19:15.704
all the turmoils, all the poison of the world

19:15.729 --> 19:20.633
He drank on this great day, that is why it is called Maha Shivratri.

19:21.934 --> 19:27.701
He took the whole dark night into Himself.

19:27.726 --> 19:35.370
He absorbed all the darkness of the world inside Him.

19:37.668 --> 19:43.194
I cannot force you, but you should try it out.

19:43.219 --> 19:47.130
You should decide that on next Maha Shivratri

19:47.155 --> 19:51.040
we will not fast and see how strongly the vibrations flow.

19:53.097 --> 19:56.385
And ask for forgiveness!
