00:00:01.593 --> 00:00:09.978
It is so joy giving to be back in Australia.

00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:14.987
When I wanted to come here in this month,

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:21.566
Stephen told me that Perth would be scorchingly hot (Laughter)

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:26.909
and, “I don’t think you should go to Perth first, you can go later."

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:33.206
So I said, “That part you leave it to me! The rest is alright!”

00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:37.401
Now you have seen how it rained and rained and rained,

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:40.880
because you wanted rain, that was needed very much.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.765
And also you wanted a cooler atmosphere.

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:51.176
Both things have worked out.

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:57.696
But then the worry was that, because of the rain, the seekers won’t come.

00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:01.848
Also that was solved because it was a testing ground.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:05.014
I told them, “If they are real seekers they’ll come."

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:09.506
Otherwise what’s the use of having a big quantity with no seeking?

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:12.374
And see yesterday what beautiful people came!

00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:16.527
They came all the way in the rain, because

00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:20.450
they were seekers and very deep seekers. They never even asked a question!

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.208
Can you imagine, in this Australia, I am always bombarded with questions.

00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:30.054
And they had told me not to allow them to ask questions.

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:34.521
But I could feel their seeking so much, that I said, “Better ask me questions."

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:38.309
And not a single question was asked.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:42.279
So in one shot how many things are done?

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.165
You got the rain that you needed very much for your trees,

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:53.390
for your crops, for your fruits, for everything.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.419
And it was most unexpected.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:02.977
And then you got it cooled down so that our programmes could go on well.

00:02:03.057 --> 00:02:07.507
Then you got the real seekers and the real seeking.

00:02:07.587 --> 00:02:12.367
But the electricity went off. Now see the good point of electricity also.

00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:17.045
Because electricity went off, we had those candles

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:21.567
and all the bhoots I saw were just burnt with these candles on!

00:02:21.647 --> 00:02:25.040
And I came in the room, they all went, “Buk! buk! Buk!” like that,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.177
and I could see why candles had to be put!

00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:34.231
So, also, that was a good thing that we should rely sometimes on natural things.

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:37.657
We are so much dependant on electricity, is not a very good thing.

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:41.711
So we should have always provision for something natural.

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:46.458
We should keep some lanterns and things and should try to live more with the nature

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:49.377
than with this electricity.

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:54.347
I tell you this electricity is responsible for spoiling our eyes very much.

00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:59.224
Supposing we had used those lights which [the] older generation had used,

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:06.306
we would never have strained so much our eyes as we are with this electricity.

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:11.056
Because not [only] that it gives us light but also it takes away light from our eyes.

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:16.487
So too much use of electricity has made us like slaves to it.

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:21.547
As you know that, in America, once the electricity failed and so many people died.

00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:24.894
So it’s more to depend on natural things.

00:03:24.974 --> 00:03:30.958
And this is a good trend that you have, that you try to have more natural surroundings,

00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:35.657
more natural places to live in.

00:03:35.737 --> 00:03:41.766
So the main thing we have to realise, is that equilibrium

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:47.147
that is being worked out by Paramachaitanya.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:04:01.416
If Paramchaitanya is the power of love of God, then it works out equilibrium.

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:08.329
So the Sahaja Yogis who are going to work out Paramchaitanya

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.950
have to have equilibrium in their life.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:19.426
This is a place where I say resides Mahaganesha.

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:25.777
So we have to understand how Shri Ganesh brings balance in us.

00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:33.332
It’s very important to see that his swastika represents nothing else but balance.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:35.746
Balance when it is steady.

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:46.190
When it starts moving in the right direction, then constructive work starts.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.386
And also it works out all that is important for life.

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:56.066
But when it starts the other way round it works out the destructive part.

00:04:56.146 --> 00:04:58.377
These both are in balance.

00:04:58.457 --> 00:05:01.152
If they are not life cannot go on.

00:05:01.232 --> 00:05:05.262
The constructive and destructive both have to be in balance.

00:05:05.342 --> 00:05:15.510
If you see in the nature: for example, a bud has to come,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.992
and when the bud dies then the fruit comes out.

00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:28.247
The tree has to evaporate its water to the sky.

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:31.427
If it does not then it won’t rain.

00:05:31.507 --> 00:05:33.886
It won’t trigger the rain.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:37.419
But during winter season it has to drop out its leaves,

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:41.869
because these leaves have to die and fall on to the ground

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.562
to nourish the mother nature with nitrogen.

00:05:46.642 --> 00:05:52.296
Then, during summer time, again they come back.

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:59.876
So the life goes on like this, that, whatever is created is destroyed; something new comes up;

00:05:59.956 --> 00:06:07.766
again that new thing also comes up in a way that it becomes constructive.

00:06:07.846 --> 00:06:12.755
And then whatever it has constructed, part of it is destroyed.

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:16.116
So actually, if you see – in the death resides the life.

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:21.360
If there is no death – imagine if all the people who were born since long,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.986
would have been living today, we would not have been here.

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:29.946
It would have been so difficult to manage ourselves with all these people.

00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:36.576
But so many animals have died and those animals also have become human beings.

00:06:36.656 --> 00:06:43.726
So many human beings have to die to get other people to come on this Earth.

00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:47.576
And that you have to take some rest and come back again.

00:06:47.656 --> 00:06:51.486
So the death is just a change of life.

00:06:51.566 --> 00:06:55.369
Without death, life cannot exist.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.926
It’s a balance between the two.

00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:02.424
So a Sahaja Yogi should never be afraid of death. He should never be afraid of death.

00:07:02.504 --> 00:07:06.537
Because if he is going to die it is only going to be another life

00:07:06.617 --> 00:07:12.753
where he rests for a while and comes back with greater enthusiasm, with greater energy.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:16.049
So there is a complete balance in nature, if you see.

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:18.726
If there was no balance we could not have existed.

00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:23.246
Supposing the Earth was moving with a greater speed, you would not have existed.

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:30.305
If the Pacific Ocean was deeper, even by certain feet, you would not have existed.

00:07:30.385 --> 00:07:34.674
So many things are completely in balance: the distance with the sun,

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:38.070
the distance with the moon. Everything is so much in balance.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.596
If this balance breaks then we would be nowhere.

00:07:42.676 --> 00:07:53.272
So we have to understand that all this is done by Shri Ganesha.

00:07:53.352 --> 00:08:02.010
He is the one who looks after all the material things and all the things that are created.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:08.812
For example, the first chakra is created by this Mother Earth

00:08:08.892 --> 00:08:14.646
and all this universe then, is created by the second chakra.

00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:21.104
But the first chakra is the one which emits the holiness,

00:08:21.184 --> 00:08:25.836
the auspiciousness, which gives balance.

00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:29.306
Auspiciousness comes only through balance.

00:08:29.386 --> 00:08:35.873
So I find people when they have lost their balances, they go to the Right or to the Left.

00:08:35.953 --> 00:08:40.840
People are very righteous, extremely righteous, very good Sahaja Yogis,

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.111
nice, but there is no love.

00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:46.496
Without love, righteousness has no meaning.

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:49.307
Love doesn’t mean that you indulge into anything,

00:08:49.387 --> 00:08:52.865
but you must have detached love and responsibility.

00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:56.538
So in our life we should see if we have that balance or not.

00:08:56.618 --> 00:09:01.252
It’s very important if we have to see to Shri Ganesh.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:07.880
Shri Ganesha, as you know, is on Mooladhara, he controls all our senses

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.925
as far as the Mooladhara is concerned, especially all the excretion.

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:17.355
So we are not people who believe in the indulgence of it,

00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:21.272
neither we believe in the detachment of it; but in the balance.

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:25.937
That’s why you all have to be married, you have to have a proper physical life

00:09:26.017 --> 00:09:33.195
and that you should have proper children and lead a very sensible, dignified married life.

00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:34.805
That is very important.

00:09:34.885 --> 00:09:36.547
But love should be there.

00:09:36.627 --> 00:09:43.846
There should be love between husband and wife, between children and parents and everyone.

00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:48.882
If one person goes into imbalance the whole family goes into imbalance.

00:09:48.962 --> 00:09:54.041
To establish a family, sweetly and nicely, is also an art.

00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:59.737
And if both of them agree and say that, “We will do this way!”

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:01.956
I am sure it’s not difficult.

00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:08.468
Because you are Sahaja Yogis [so] you already know the quality of balancing.

00:10:08.548 --> 00:10:15.082
What I find in the West, now, is the balance has gone really on the rocks.

00:10:15.162 --> 00:10:18.818
Because, see now, there are all kinds of problems

00:10:18.898 --> 00:10:22.130
of homosexuality and this and that and all that.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.501
This is just because of imbalances [that] people have gone to that limit.

00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:33.576
Another is asceticism, where your people are ascetic, made ascetic like in TM and all that.

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:35.288
They have taken to these things.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:37.486
Because these are unnatural things.

00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:40.065
Natural is to be in balance.

00:10:40.145 --> 00:10:43.800
If you are not in balance then things go off

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:50.445
and you become either too much of something and nothing of the other.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.896
That’s how people suffer.

00:10:52.976 --> 00:11:00.896
So from Ganesha’s chakra we have to learn what are we doing.

00:11:00.976 --> 00:11:07.431
So sometimes we have to accumulate things, we have to consume things,

00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:10.346
and then we have to throw them away also.

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:15.799
It is not that what ever we consume is just stored up within us or in the house.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:21.476
So we must also learn how to throw away things and how to take inside.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:25.937
This is in our household [and] in our thought also.

00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:31.400
In our thought also, when we receive some thoughts from anywhere,

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.398
we should only digest that [which] is good for us.

00:11:34.478 --> 00:11:37.822
And it’s digested because of Paramachaitanya.

00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:41.126
The rest should be thrown away, you shouldn’t bother [with it].

00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:43.229
Like yesterday somebody met me.

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:48.317
She said, “Mother I am a Catholic and I cannot get out of Catholicism."

00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:51.157
She is supposed to be, she wants to do, Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:51.237 --> 00:11:53.807
Then I said, “You stay inside Catholicism."

00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:56.496
Because there is no question of balance.

00:11:56.576 --> 00:12:04.740
But in Sahaja Yoga whatever good of Catholicism, means that you have to worship Christ

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.307
– that part is alright.

00:12:06.387 --> 00:12:09.467
The rest, whatever is nonsensical has to be thrown away.

00:12:09.547 --> 00:12:19.468
So the whole atmosphere that you face, of thoughts, of ideas, of books,

00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:22.460
whatever you read, you must develop a capacity

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.145
to consume that [which] is good for you, and whatever is bad you should throw away.

00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:31.546
I must say in Austria people are really doing that very well.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:34.637
Somebody is now doing research on Koran.

00:12:34.717 --> 00:12:40.157
He is taking out all the essences of Koran which are in balance.

00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:45.477
Koran talks of balance: talks of that you must have balance – equilibrium.

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:48.892
It talks of it, and so he has taken that point.

00:12:48.972 --> 00:12:58.106
And now he is taking out all that creates imbalances in the Islamic book called ‘Koran’,

00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:00.316
which people have used for imbalances.

00:13:00.396 --> 00:13:06.196
On one point you can show how they have gone, deviated, from their path.

00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:09.227
‘Deviated’ means – they have gone into imbalances.

00:13:09.307 --> 00:13:13.047
For example Christianity now: you can take it very clearly

00:13:13.127 --> 00:13:16.126
that they didn’t use Ganesha’s principle there at all.

00:13:16.206 --> 00:13:23.449
But all throughout it’s written that you have to look after yourself in a moral way,

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:28.049
that in the Old Testament it is written that...

00:13:38.664 --> 00:13:43.452
In the Old Testament it is written: ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery’.

00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:47.424
But Christ has made it even subtler – very subtle

00:13:47.504 --> 00:13:49.730
– because He’s at Agnya controlling the eyes.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.038
So he said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:59.463
But the Christians have crossed all the limits of adultery, all the limits.

00:13:59.543 --> 00:14:05.016
I mean, I don’t know to what limit they are going to go now, I mean really they have gone amuck,

00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:13.372
the way they are going into this kind of experimentation.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:16.081
And then what will happen to your children?

00:14:16.161 --> 00:14:18.513
What will happen to your society?

00:14:18.593 --> 00:14:23.595
That’s what is happening now, in complete imbalance.

00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:27.091
Completely in imbalance, all these societies,

00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:36.123
where they are using adultery as a style of life.

00:14:36.203 --> 00:14:41.454
What Christ has said, just the opposite they are doing.

00:14:41.534 --> 00:14:46.734
Same as Shri Krishna has said that in everybody resides the Spirit.

00:14:46.814 --> 00:14:48.866
Then everybody is just the same.

00:14:48.946 --> 00:14:51.079
So how can you have caste system?

00:14:51.159 --> 00:14:55.487
You can have at the most caste system according to the work that you are doing.

00:14:55.567 --> 00:15:01.526
But you can’t have caste system according to the birth.

00:15:01.606 --> 00:15:02.802
You cannot have.

00:15:02.882 --> 00:15:05.695
I mean it’s so plain, clean.

00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:11.586
You can see it so clearly, He has said it, that everybody has got the Spirit.

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:14.620
So everybody can ascend.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.667
Christ has said the same thing.

00:15:16.747 --> 00:15:20.420
He has not said that women don’t have the Spirit or men have the Spirit.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.512
And look at the way that these people are talking that they cannot have ordination.

00:15:24.592 --> 00:15:30.348
Of course ordination itself is humbug, but still.

00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:34.362
But to deprive someone of certain rights because they are women or men

00:15:34.442 --> 00:15:37.861
is something absolutely, I should say, nonsense.

00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:44.586
It has no relevance to dharma, because ‘dharma’ means balance.

00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:46.063
‘Dharma’ means balance.

00:15:46.143 --> 00:15:52.037
The one who has balance is the man who is dharmic, who is in the centre.

00:15:52.117 --> 00:16:02.009
If you are in the centre, say you take, say a balance, this called as balancing.

00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:04.407
But in Hindi it’s called as taraju (तराजू).

00:16:04.487 --> 00:16:07.684
Now you hold it in the hand. It’s called as balance, can you imagine?

00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:12.876
You hold it in the centre. The centre of gravity of that balance is in the centre.

00:16:12.956 --> 00:16:18.642
Now if you go more on this side this will go down, or you go on this side it will go down.

00:16:18.722 --> 00:16:25.197
But if you are at the gravity point you cannot move this side or that side.

00:16:25.277 --> 00:16:29.507
Can you imagine the gravity is coming from Mother Earth!

00:16:29.587 --> 00:16:33.227
And Mother Earth has made Shri Ganesha.

00:16:33.307 --> 00:16:37.017
So this gravity point within us is to be maintained

00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:41.479
and this gravity comes very natural to human beings.

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:43.491
It’s not to be adopted or anything.

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:50.074
If [in] childhood, if children are told about their gravity, about their dignity,

00:16:50.154 --> 00:16:56.369
about their greatness, they will immediately develop it with a great pride that,

00:16:56.449 --> 00:17:03.757
“We are something special and that we have to have this gravity within us."

00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:09.437
Now this gravity gives you a kind of an attraction.

00:17:09.517 --> 00:17:15.307
Anybody who is grave, doesn’t mean that you pull a big face, it never means that.

00:17:15.387 --> 00:17:22.650
But gravity means that you are not disturbed easily by any turmoil or anything.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.401
Gravity means so many things as you can see, from Shri Ganesha’s character.

00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:33.137
Gravity means you are the one who is standing in the centre.

00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:39.650
A person who sees everything and doesn’t get disturbed,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.024
doesn’t get tempted, is self-contented,

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:48.737
doesn’t ask for anything, doesn’t need anything,

00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:55.117
doesn’t take revenge, forgives.

00:17:55.197 --> 00:17:58.648
Because he has no way to get out of his gravity.

00:17:58.728 --> 00:18:00.437
He is just bound there.

00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:05.083
Now somebody takes a revenge and runs away: “Alright, go away!”

00:18:05.163 --> 00:18:08.007
If somebody tries to trouble him: “Alright, go away!”

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.973
Because he can’t run out of that gravity point.

00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:14.305
That other person has lost his balance but he can’t run after

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.398
that person who is in imbalance.

00:18:16.478 --> 00:18:19.413
So he doesn’t run after that person who has done wrong.

00:18:19.493 --> 00:18:23.357
He says, “Alright, he has done wrong? Have pity on him let him do that."

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:26.337
He doesn’t run after that person. He is standing there.

00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:34.321
And his standing there itself is sufficient to frighten others, and to destroy others.

00:18:34.401 --> 00:18:38.297
Because he’s standing at a point where he cannot be destroyed.

00:18:38.377 --> 00:18:40.887
But the others are running towards destruction.

00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:45.590
So what’s the use of running after him, getting yourself also destroyed?

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:54.707
Such a person who has achieved that balance sees others as something to be pitied,

00:18:54.787 --> 00:18:58.592
because he sees they are on the verge of falling down.

00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:03.134
I am here nicely settled down, but they are on the verge of falling down.

00:19:03.214 --> 00:19:07.707
They may try to tell him, they may try to help him.

00:19:07.787 --> 00:19:10.324
They may try to do everything for that person,

00:19:10.404 --> 00:19:13.168
because they can see that person is going to fall down.

00:19:13.248 --> 00:19:18.677
But if that person doesn’t want to take to balance you cannot force it.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:23.754
So the Ganesha’s greatest quality is that he has gravity.

00:19:23.834 --> 00:19:27.851
With that gravity he sits down on this Mother Earth.

00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:33.070
Now, because this is a country of Ganesha,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.402
the Australians must have balance, should, naturally have.

00:19:38.482 --> 00:19:40.895
But they don’t. I must tell you, they don’t.

00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:45.870
And my experience of Australians before I started Sahaja Yoga has been terrific,

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.087
I must tell you that (laughing)!

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:57.186
If an Australian starts drinking, only person who can compete with him is a Russian!

00:19:58.137 --> 00:20:02.187
And then they talk so irrelevantly, you don’t know how to deal with them.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:09.369
If they shake your hand, then you will feel, after some time, you have lost it.

00:20:09.449 --> 00:20:13.520
Everything they do in such a big way

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.960
that I couldn’t understand why is it [that] they shake your hand so badly.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.804
So C.P. said, “You see they have lots of jungles."

00:20:21.884 --> 00:20:27.567
He tried to console me, “and there are lots of animals and things and

00:20:27.647 --> 00:20:30.075
that’s why you see they shake hands like that."

00:20:30.155 --> 00:20:32.723
I said, “No animal shakes hands you see!”

00:20:32.803 --> 00:20:36.547
How have they learned from the animals? I can’t get this explanation alright!

00:20:36.627 --> 00:20:40.567
On the contrary they are extremely gentle.

00:20:40.647 --> 00:20:44.087
Animals are extremely gentle with each other.

00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:47.757
So how this kind of shaking hands has started?

00:20:47.837 --> 00:20:52.400
And only people who can beat them are Greeks who shake hands in a very funny way

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.557
that really you get a big jerk!

00:20:54.637 --> 00:21:01.910
So I felt that the country of Ganesha,

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:11.737
should be absolutely in balance and in one tune with this Paramachaitanya.

00:21:11.817 --> 00:21:15.107
You see the animals who live in the jungles.

00:21:15.187 --> 00:21:17.307
You have so much of nature.

00:21:17.387 --> 00:21:22.880
See these trees – they grow up to a point and they do not aggress others,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.207
they do not fight, they do not have groups. Nothing of the kind.

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:31.778
Just they grow, accept whatever is given to them,

00:21:31.858 --> 00:21:38.827
live with it happily, and if they have to be destroyed they accept the destruction.

00:21:40.227 --> 00:21:43.585
But they are absolutely in contact with God,

00:21:43.665 --> 00:21:47.145
or under the complete control of God almighty.

00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:52.797
That’s why animals are called as ‘pashu’, means pash, means ‘under the control of God’.

00:21:52.877 --> 00:21:55.395
While we have got freedom.

00:21:55.475 --> 00:21:57.527
Even we have got freedom.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:22:00.402
Still this is the country of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:00.482 --> 00:22:06.297
[What] the nature should really imbibe within you, is the balance.

00:22:06.377 --> 00:22:10.673
And the balance should come in such a manner

00:22:10.753 --> 00:22:17.214
that your whole character, your own temperament should show that balance within you.

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:22.250
But what I find is the most difficult thing in Australia

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:29.947
that there are groups and people fight and lots of problems with that.

00:22:30.027 --> 00:22:38.227
It surprises me – how can [it be], in the country of Ganesha, where there are ganas?

00:22:38.307 --> 00:22:40.107
All Ganas are here.

00:22:40.187 --> 00:22:44.078
If ganas start fighting with each other what will happen?

00:22:44.158 --> 00:22:48.571
Supposing the anti-bodies in our body start fighting with each other

00:22:48.651 --> 00:22:51.017
then what will happen to our body?

00:22:51.097 --> 00:22:52.467
So you are like ganas!

00:22:52.547 --> 00:22:57.329
You are specially blessed people to be born in this special country.

00:22:57.409 --> 00:23:04.450
And, after all these achievements that you have made, if you are going to take these

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:11.032
absolutely nonsensical things of the countries which are over developed,

00:23:11.112 --> 00:23:17.857
have lost their balance, then what’s the use of being born in this Ganesha’s land?

00:23:17.937 --> 00:23:23.658
In this Ganesha’s land you have to have a complete balance within yourself.

00:23:23.738 --> 00:23:28.630
That’s what I expect from the Sahaja Yogis of Australia:

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:34.757
that they have to give to the whole world the sense of balance of Shri Ganesha.

00:23:34.837 --> 00:23:38.638
On the contrary it is being reported to me

00:23:38.718 --> 00:23:52.194
that, every time we have our programme in Ganapatipule, people have noticed

00:23:52.274 --> 00:23:57.512
that there are groups in Australia,

00:23:57.592 --> 00:24:04.677
that people are not clean hearted; they talk ill of others.

00:24:04.757 --> 00:24:10.576
And they told me, warned me, “Mother be on the look out, why it is happening.

00:24:10.656 --> 00:24:17.517
They speak something behind their backs and try to convince the people of other countries about it."

00:24:17.597 --> 00:24:21.142
Of course they being so clean that they don’t like it.

00:24:21.222 --> 00:24:24.055
They don’t want to hear it from Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:24.135 --> 00:24:28.387
They don’t want to hear against anyone who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.497
So they informed me, “Mother this is a very serious thing!”

00:24:31.577 --> 00:24:35.247
And certain things [that] they have told me are really very serious.

00:24:35.327 --> 00:24:40.677
So now we have to first decide that we should bear no grudge to anyone.

00:24:40.757 --> 00:24:43.917
How can you bear a grudge to anyone?

00:24:43.997 --> 00:24:47.497
We have to be forgiving. All the time forgiving.

00:24:47.577 --> 00:24:51.094
Something, somebody has said it, alright, doesn’t matter.

00:24:51.174 --> 00:24:56.641
As it is, English language, you know, is not a very soft language, it’s not a very soft language,

00:24:56.721 --> 00:25:00.941
and in that if you say something one should not mind.

00:25:01.021 --> 00:25:04.967
It’s a very humorous language but the humour sometimes cuts you out.

00:25:05.047 --> 00:25:06.300
But it doesn’t matter.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.082
That’s the defect of the language.

00:25:09.162 --> 00:25:13.203
But that doesn’t mean that you should say harsh words to anyone,

00:25:13.283 --> 00:25:17.404
or you should be indifferent to anyone.

00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:21.506
Do your duties to your children, to your wife, to your husband.

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:25.661
Indifference to anyone, itself, is tremendous harshness.

00:25:25.741 --> 00:25:29.757
For the small thing if a woman gets angry and doesn’t talk to her husband,

00:25:29.837 --> 00:25:34.067
or if the husband neglects the wife, and doesn’t bother about her, looking after her,

00:25:34.147 --> 00:25:37.496
caring for her, then it’s a crime.

00:25:37.576 --> 00:25:40.773
According to Sahaja Yoga it’s a wrong thing to do.

00:25:40.853 --> 00:25:45.180
Because you must have balance you must have softness of nature.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:50.663
You should talk very softly to others and be kind and nice.

00:25:50.743 --> 00:25:54.840
Just find out if you are doing that or not.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:02.063
Then between the group [also]. It’s a question of using the power of love.

00:26:02.143 --> 00:26:04.649
We have no other power: we have no money power,

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:07.861
we have no this political power, economic power, nothing.

00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:10.975
What power we have got is the power of love.

00:26:11.055 --> 00:26:16.808
For that, when you talk to each other, one has to talk in a soft manner;

00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:19.673
extremely soft and kind manner.

00:26:19.753 --> 00:26:27.354
You’ll be surprised: I must say, in my experience, I have found Germans like that!

00:26:27.434 --> 00:26:31.666
Extremely soft to each other, extremely gentle!

00:26:31.746 --> 00:26:37.709
I mean I can’t believe these Germans who killed the whole world once upon a time!

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:43.345
Now in Sahaja Yoga suddenly they have realise, “What a horrible thing we have done!”

00:26:43.425 --> 00:26:48.002
And Sahaja Yogis, they are extremely gentle.

00:26:48.082 --> 00:26:54.211
You scratch anyone and you will be surprised that the, all of them,

00:26:54.291 --> 00:27:02.347
all the Sahaja Yogis are extremely, extremely gentle.

00:27:02.427 --> 00:27:05.314
While the Italians I used to think

00:27:05.394 --> 00:27:10.150
would be very gentle, because they have art, culture, everything

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.373
and they produce such nice things.

00:27:12.453 --> 00:27:16.990
But on the contrary I find that Germans can beat them.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.684
It’s beautiful German Sahaja Yogis there have.

00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:23.943
They hate neo-fascism. They said, “We have had enough of it!

00:27:24.023 --> 00:27:26.636
We had such a bad name all over the world!

00:27:26.716 --> 00:27:29.913
If they know we are Germans nobody wants to look at us!”

00:27:29.993 --> 00:27:31.545
And what are these people doing?

00:27:31.625 --> 00:27:36.450
So they have become extremely gentle, from one end to another end.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.603
And this gentleness really brings them out,

00:27:39.683 --> 00:27:42.891
because everybody is so surprised

00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:46.805
that Germans could be that gentle, so sweet.

00:27:46.885 --> 00:27:49.898
Now look at Shri Ganesh – how gentle he is,

00:27:49.978 --> 00:27:54.531
how sweet he is and how innocent he is.

00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:58.423
His ways are so gentle: how he works on you,

00:27:58.503 --> 00:28:04.590
how he makes things for you, how gently he does all these things.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.053
Like see now you cannot see this flower opening.

00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:11.132
In my room you put some flowers and they started growing.

00:28:11.212 --> 00:28:15.383
You can’t see the growth. If you put a camera of a special nature

00:28:15.463 --> 00:28:17.461
which can record, you can see it growing there,

00:28:17.541 --> 00:28:21.069
but you can’t see [normally]. You can’t see a tree growing.

00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:24.699
You can’t see a flower opening out.

00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:32.709
You just can’t see anything that is growing by nature, by Shri Ganesh.

00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:34.642
He does it so gently.

00:28:34.722 --> 00:28:38.629
Now also he will not grow trees one on top of another!

00:28:38.709 --> 00:28:43.538
But in such a way that they all get the suns rays.

00:28:43.618 --> 00:28:48.039
Just like a great mother, I must say, the way, gently, he does everything.

00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:51.857
Every leaf is made differently – what an art!

00:28:51.937 --> 00:28:53.069
Every leaf!

00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:56.707
In the whole world you cannot find exactly the same leaf

00:28:56.787 --> 00:29:00.500
whether it is from Australia or from America.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.698
The leaf, if you see it under a microscope, will differ.

00:29:04.778 --> 00:29:08.058
Every leaf! Can you imagine?

00:29:08.138 --> 00:29:14.495
Look at his work, how gently he puts everything, how gently he works.

00:29:14.575 --> 00:29:23.894
And while we are living on the grounds of Shri Ganesha how gentle we should be.

00:29:23.974 --> 00:29:28.505
And in dealing with people we should be extremely, extremely gentle.

00:29:28.585 --> 00:29:35.150
We should show that we are Ganesha’s special ganas.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.904
That’s what I feel about Australians.

00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:42.302
We have had some mishaps, I know, doesn’t matter.

00:29:42.382 --> 00:29:45.053
But that’s alright. A few of them were like that.

00:29:45.133 --> 00:29:54.585
But all of you should really learn to be very loving, gentle, kind and concerned.

00:29:54.665 --> 00:30:01.733
Small, small things can make people happy, very happy.

00:30:01.813 --> 00:30:05.863
And I try all these tricks myself and you should also try these tricks.

00:30:05.943 --> 00:30:08.173
It’s very simple.

00:30:08.253 --> 00:30:15.592
One day I gave a sari to a lady, so she said, “Mother how do you know I love this colour?”

00:30:15.672 --> 00:30:17.763
“Because I have seen you mostly wearing this colour.

00:30:17.843 --> 00:30:19.213
So I know you love this colour."

00:30:19.293 --> 00:30:20.363
“But did you see me?”

00:30:20.443 --> 00:30:22.503
“Yes, of course, I saw you."

00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:28.880
So these small things: she was so heartened; she felt that, “Mother notices me,”

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.323
Because I have seen you.

00:30:31.403 --> 00:30:33.233
I mean I see all of you.

00:30:33.313 --> 00:30:37.973
But I know about all of you because I am concerned and bothered about you.

00:30:38.053 --> 00:30:43.456
And everyone I know where you stand, what’s wrong with you, what should be done,

00:30:43.536 --> 00:30:45.914
what you like, what you don’t like.

00:30:45.994 --> 00:30:48.051
There’s no harm in doing that.

00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:52.723
It’s much better to have a better rapport when you understand what’s the problem is.

00:30:52.803 --> 00:30:54.738
I immediately know what’s the problem.

00:30:54.818 --> 00:31:00.981
I know a person who is dominating, I know a person who is mistrusting. Everything I know.

00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:08.249
And gradually I try to tell them in a very gentle way that, “This should be corrected."

00:31:09.983 --> 00:31:11.641
But you need not tell them.

00:31:11.721 --> 00:31:16.249
For you there’s a very simple method of giving bandhans and improving people.

00:31:16.329 --> 00:31:20.789
You don’t have to worry about doing something very drastic about it

00:31:20.869 --> 00:31:22.597
or to tell them on the face.

00:31:22.677 --> 00:31:26.316
Only thing if you give bandhan to them you can do it.

00:31:26.396 --> 00:31:34.460
Now, about this, how to develop this balance,

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.392
is the big problem and I was thinking that

00:31:38.472 --> 00:31:42.152
I will talk about this later on to people in details:

00:31:42.232 --> 00:31:47.013
how to develop the balance in our character, in our nature.

00:31:47.093 --> 00:31:50.313
Of course meditation does help you to be in the centre.

00:31:50.393 --> 00:31:53.432
But, still, sometimes we just slip off.

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:59.626
And there is a way by which you can really make your character

00:31:59.706 --> 00:32:03.763
in such a way that you’ll remain in balance all the time.

00:32:03.843 --> 00:32:10.253
On the contrary when there will be a crisis you will just jump on to your gravity point.

00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:12.703
That should happen. If that happens no problem.

00:32:12.783 --> 00:32:14.232
It happens with me.

00:32:14.312 --> 00:32:19.920
If I see any crisis anywhere, in Sahaja Yoga, in my family life, or anywhere,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.133
immediately I know that I am deep down on to my gravity.

00:32:24.213 --> 00:32:29.799
And from there I can see everything so clearly and then I solve the problem.

00:32:29.879 --> 00:32:34.470
That is what one has to understand, that you have to jump on your gravity.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.333
And then it’s not a relative position.

00:32:37.413 --> 00:32:40.903
To be on the gravity is not a relative position.

00:32:40.983 --> 00:32:48.275
It is not that you have to compare yourself with others.

00:32:48.955 --> 00:32:51.121
No you don’t have to.

00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:54.883
You don’t have to think that I’ll be losing this or I’ll be gaining this.

00:32:54.963 --> 00:32:57.993
Nothing of the kind. You are there on your own position.

00:32:58.073 --> 00:32:59.393
You are there.

00:32:59.473 --> 00:33:02.183
You are in charge of yourself.

00:33:02.263 --> 00:33:03.533
So you don’t worry.

00:33:03.613 --> 00:33:12.106
There is no jealousy, there’s no fear, there’s no kind of a temptation, just you are there.

00:33:12.186 --> 00:33:13.753
You are not bothered.

00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:18.446
Sometimes I have seen the leaders are worried about their leadership sometimes.

00:33:18.526 --> 00:33:24.542
Now leadership is just hocus-pocus, I must tell you.

00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:30.417
If somebody says Mother you become the leader I’ll say, “No.

00:33:30.497 --> 00:33:33.463
I know.

00:33:33.543 --> 00:33:35.391
I know that joke!”

00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:38.824
So it’s a joke. Leadership is a joke you see.

00:33:38.904 --> 00:33:43.641
And if you know it’s a joke, then only you will work it out better.

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:48.343
Because, there’s nothing like hierarchy in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:48.423 --> 00:33:50.743
As you know, we are all one, the same.

00:33:50.823 --> 00:33:53.109
We cannot say that hands are better than feet

00:33:53.189 --> 00:33:56.067
and the feet is better than this – nothing of the kind.

00:33:56.147 --> 00:33:59.650
In the same way everything is very important,

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:03.267
and everything circulates like the blood cells.

00:34:03.347 --> 00:34:08.205
So we do not say that this blood cell is good and that blood cell is bad.

00:34:08.285 --> 00:34:11.842
Or this blood cell is higher, that blood cell is higher.

00:34:11.922 --> 00:34:14.832
In the same way everybody is circulating.

00:34:14.912 --> 00:34:16.757
So one should not have any fear.

00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:20.932
Also fear of the leader should not be there. There’s no need to fear the leader.

00:34:21.012 --> 00:34:23.832
If you are on your gravity you keep to it.

00:34:23.912 --> 00:34:25.252
He will understand you.

00:34:25.332 --> 00:34:28.110
As long as leader is on the gravity he’ll be there,

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:33.122
as soon as he goes away from the gravity he’ll go away himself.

00:34:33.202 --> 00:34:38.972
So you stand on your own gravity point and nobody can disturb you.

00:34:39.052 --> 00:34:41.380
You should have no fear, nothing.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.522
Nothing to bother in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:43.602 --> 00:34:46.412
As it is you are all saints. What is there to bother?

00:34:46.492 --> 00:34:54.174
The whole ganas, all the angels, all this All-pervading Power is looking after you.

00:34:54.254 --> 00:35:02.123
Yesterday we saw a kind of a light, miraculous light, following us on both the sides of the car.

00:35:02.203 --> 00:35:05.538
Especially on my side there was such a lot of light following.

00:35:05.618 --> 00:35:10.761
Just giving [an] indication that it’s alright, this is Ganesha’s place

00:35:10.841 --> 00:35:14.453
and here things are going to work out.

00:35:14.533 --> 00:35:19.405
So you are placed so well, you have so many powers within yourself

00:35:19.485 --> 00:35:23.029
and which you can express very well.

00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:25.538
Fearlessly you can have it within yourself.

00:35:25.618 --> 00:35:28.733
Anybody who tries to trouble you will be looked after

00:35:28.813 --> 00:35:34.003
by this All-pervading Power, you don’t have to do anything about it.

00:35:34.083 --> 00:35:37.749
So try to see: are you in balance in any way.

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:42.142
Some people are too much attached to their family and some people are detached.

00:35:42.222 --> 00:35:45.882
Too much attachment to family is also wrong.

00:35:45.962 --> 00:35:49.197
What is the need to be attached so much? You’ll spoil your children.

00:35:49.277 --> 00:35:51.463
When they grow up they hit you back.

00:35:51.543 --> 00:35:56.517
So best is to keep them in balance, have a detached attitude towards life.

00:35:56.597 --> 00:36:03.035
And this detached attitude, as I had told you, is like the sap in the tree

00:36:03.115 --> 00:36:05.292
which goes to all the places.

00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:09.650
If it is surplus it can evaporate or it can go down,

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:13.688
but it doesn’t stick to anything, because if it sticks to anything,

00:36:13.768 --> 00:36:18.162
that involvement will kill that tree and also kill that part,

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:20.673
that flower, where it is sticking on to.

00:36:20.753 --> 00:36:27.251
So we see that attached love is the death of the love.

00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:33.690
So we have to have a proper understanding of this detached love,

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:38.416
where you stand on your gravity

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:44.259
and you have concern about everyone, you think about everyone.

00:36:44.339 --> 00:36:57.000
In case you find that somebody is not alright, you don’t lose your balance,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:01.003
but get that person in the balance.

00:37:01.083 --> 00:37:05.690
If you start losing your balance then how can you get back that person.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:11.616
And in that way you will lose all your hatred, all your anger,

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:21.587
all your lust, or what you can call, all your competition, all that.

00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:26.867
Because you stand in your own dignity. You don’t want [a] certificate from anyone.

00:37:26.947 --> 00:37:32.412
You don’t want any praising from anyone.

00:37:32.492 --> 00:37:36.882
You just know that you are there. And you are self-contented.

00:37:36.962 --> 00:37:41.683
Then it’s not also necessary that, “Mother must give me a special audience!”

00:37:41.763 --> 00:37:43.193
It’s all ego.

00:37:43.273 --> 00:37:45.140
“I must see Mother!

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.920
I have to see her privately!” What is the need to see me privately?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.263
I am never private. I am available every time to you, all the time.

00:37:53.343 --> 00:37:58.046
So all these things are coming out of the ignorance

00:37:58.126 --> 00:38:03.015
and out of the fact that you are not on your gravity point.

00:38:03.095 --> 00:38:09.549
So today, to begin with, we have this Ganesh puja where we all should, in our heart, think

00:38:09.629 --> 00:38:15.429
what is our gravity point and [on] that we have to stand very firm.

00:38:15.509 --> 00:38:18.138
May God bless you.
