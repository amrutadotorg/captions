00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.300
It is so joy giving to be back in Australia.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.190
When I wanted to come here in this month,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:23.360
Stephen told me that Perth would be scorchingly
hot (Laughter) and, “I don’t think you

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.029
should go to Perth first, you can go later."

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.190
So I said, “That part you leave it to me!

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.329
The rest is alright!”

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.670
Now you have seen how it rained and rained
and rained, because you wanted rain.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.320
That was needed very much.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.159
And also you wanted a cooler atmosphere.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.140
Both things have worked out.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.399
But then the worry was that, because of the
rain, the seekers won’t come.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.909
Also that was solved because it was a testing
ground.

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.559
I told them, “If they are real seekers they’ll
come."

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.780
Otherwise what’s the use of having a big
quantity with no seeking?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.420
And see yesterday what beautiful people came!

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.890
They came all the way in the rain, because
they were seekers and very deep seekers.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.299
They never even asked a question!

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.579
Can you imagine, in this Australia, I am always
bombarded with questions.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.210
And they had told me not to allow them to
ask questions But I could feel their seeking

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.869
so much, that I said, “Better ask me questions."

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.649
And not a single question was asked.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.540
So in one shot how many things are done?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.049
You got the rain that you needed very much
for your trees, for your crops, for your fruits,

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.710
for everything.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.750
And it was most unexpected.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.159
And then you got it cooled down so that our
programmes could go on well.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.770
Then you got the real seekers and the real
seeking.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.100
But the electricity went off.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.349
Now see the good point of electricity, also:
because electricity went off,

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:21.830
we had those candles and all the bhoots I
saw were just burnt with these candles on!

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.799
And I came in the room [and] they all went,

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.799
“Buk! buk!

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.440
Buk!” like that, and I could see why candles
had to be put!

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.689
So, also, that was a good thing that we should
rely sometimes on natural things.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.920
We are so much dependant on electricity, is
not a very good thing.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.030
So we should have always provision for something
natural.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.080
We should keep some lanterns and things and
should try to live more with the nature than

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.390
with this electricity.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.610
I tell you this electricity is responsible
for spoiling our eyes very much.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.819
Supposing we had used those lights which [the]
older generation had used, we would never

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.569
have strained so much our eyes as we are with
this electricity.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.319
Because not [only] that it gives us light
but also it takes away light from our eyes.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.750
So too much use of electricity has made us
like slaves to it.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.810
As you know that, in America, once the electricity
failed and so many people died.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.030
So it’s more to depend on natural things.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.930
And this is a good trend that you have, that
you try to have more natural surroundings,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.920
more natural places to live in.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:47.410
So the main thing we have to realise, is that
equilibrium that is being worked out by Paramachaitanya.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:04:01.750
If Paramchaitanya is the power of love of
God, then it works out equilibrium.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:10.129
So the Sahaja Yogis who are going to work
out Paramchaitanya have to have equilibrium

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.420
in their life.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.760
This is a place where I say resides Mahaganesha.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.730
So we have to understand how Shri Ganesh brings
balance in us.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:33.890
It’s very important to see that his swastika
represents nothing else but balance.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.080
Balance when it is steady.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:46.630
When it starts moving in the right direction,
then constructive work starts.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.720
And also it works out all that is important
for life.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.690
But when it starts the other way round it
works out the destructive part.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.630
These both are in balance.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.290
If they are not life cannot go on.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.060
The constructive and destructive both have
to be in balance.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:17.570
If you see in the nature: for example, a bud
has to come, and when the bud dies then the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.350
fruit comes out.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:28.500
The tree has to evaporate its water to the
sky.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.680
If it does not then it won’t rain.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.220
It won’t trigger the rain.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.250
But during winter season it has to drop out
its leaves, because these leaves have to die

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.340
and fall on to the ground to nourish the mother
nature with nitrogen.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.630
Then, during summer time, again they come
back.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.470
So the life goes on like this, that, whatever
is created is destroyed; something new comes

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:08.100
up; again that new thing also comes up in
a way that it becomes constructive.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.740
And then whatever it has constructed, part
of it is destroyed.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.770
So actually, if you see – in the death resides
the life.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.750
If there is no death – imagine if all the
people who were born since long, would have

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.320
been living today – we would not have been
here.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.280
It would have been so difficult to manage
ourselves with all these people.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.910
But so many animals have died and those animals
also have become human beings.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:44.060
So many human beings have to die to get other
people to come on this Earth.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.910
And that you have to take some rest and come
back again.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.820
So the death is just a change of life.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.020
Without death, life cannot exist.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.260
It’s a balance between the two.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.630
So a Sahaja Yogi should never be afraid of
death.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.330
He should never be afraid of death.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.400
Because if he is going to die it is only going
to be another life where he rests for a while

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.880
and comes back with greater enthusiasm, with
greater energy.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.270
So there is a complete balance in nature,
if you see.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.060
If there was no balance we could not have
existed.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.500
Supposing the Earth was moving with a greater
speed, you would not have existed.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:30.470
If the Pacific Ocean was deeper, even by certain
feet, you would not have existed.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.490
So many things are completely in balance:
the distance with the sun, the distance with

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.680
the moon.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.710
Everything is so much in balance.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.930
If this balance breaks then we would be nowhere.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:52.490
So we have to understand that all this is
done by Shri Ganesha.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:08:03.190
He is the one who looks after all the material
things and all the things that are created.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:11.550
For example, the first chakra is created by
this Mother Earth and all this universe then,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.980
is created by the second chakra.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:24.170
But the first chakra is the one which emits
the holiness, the auspiciousness, which gives

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.170
balance.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.640
Auspiciousness comes only through balance.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.099
So I find people when they have lost their
balances, they go to the Right or to the Left.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:42.050
People are very righteous, extremely righteous,
very good Sahaja Yogis, nice, but there is

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.050
no love.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.399
Without love, righteousness has no meaning.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:51.610
Love doesn’t mean that you indulge into
anything, but you must have detached love

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.199
and responsibility.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.450
So in our life we should see if we have that
balance or not.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.410
It’s very important if we have to see to
Shri Ganesh.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:09.129
Shri Ganesha, as you know, is on Mooladhara,
he controls all our senses as far as the Mooladhara

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:13.259
is concerned, especially all the excretion.

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:19.210
So we are not people who believe in the indulgence
of it, neither we believe in the detachment

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.790
of it; but in the balance.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.680
That’s why you all have to be married, you
have to have a proper physical life and that

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:33.529
you should have proper children and lead a
very sensible, dignified married life.

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.139
That is very important.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:36.410
But love should be there.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:44.180
There should be love between husband and wife,
between children and parents and everyone.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.110
If one person goes into imbalance the whole
family goes into imbalance.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:54.470
To establish a family, sweetly and nicely,
is also an art.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:59.910
And if both of them agree and say that, “We
will do this way!”

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.290
I am sure it’s not difficult.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:07.579
Because you are Sahaja Yogis [so] you already
know the quality of balancing.

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:15.300
What I find in the West, now, is the balance
has gone really on the rocks.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:22.100
Because, see now, there are all kinds of problems
of homosexuality and this and that and all

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.100
that.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.470
This is just because of imbalances [that]
people have gone to that limit.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:33.910
Another is asceticism, where your people are
ascetic, made ascetic like in TM and all that.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.209
They have taken to these things.

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:37.820
Because these are unnatural things.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.399
Natural is to be in balance.

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:48.480
If you are not in balance then things go off
and you become either too much of something

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.310
and nothing of the other.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.230
That’s how people suffer.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:11:01.230
So from Ganesha’s chakra we have to learn
what are we doing.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:08.860
So sometimes we have to accumulate things,
we have to consume things, and then we have

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.680
to throw them away also.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.920
It is not that what ever we consume is just
stored up within us or in the house.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.629
So we must also learn how to throw away things
and how to take inside.

00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:26.080
This is in our household [and] in our thought
also.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:33.129
In our thought also, when we receive some
thoughts from anywhere, we should only digest

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:34.690
that [which] is good for us.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.420
And it’s digested because of Paramachaitanya.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.519
The rest should be thrown away, you shouldn’t
bother [with it].

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:43.009
Like yesterday somebody met me.

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:48.100
She said, “Mother I am a Catholic and I
cannot get out of Catholicism."

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.550
She is supposed to be, she wants to do, Sahaja
Yoga.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.200
Then I said, “You stay inside Catholicism."

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.889
Because there is no question of balance.

00:11:56.889 --> 00:12:05.180
But in Sahaja Yoga whatever good of Catholicism,
means that you have to worship Christ – that

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.279
part is alright.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.860
The rest, whatever is nonsensical has to be
thrown away.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:20.020
So the whole atmosphere that you face, of
thoughts, of ideas, of books, whatever you

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.199
read, you must develop a capacity to consume
that [which] is good for you, and whatever

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:27.149
is bad you should throw away.

00:12:27.149 --> 00:12:31.939
I must say in Austria people are really doing
that very well.

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:34.220
Somebody is now doing research on Koran.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.550
He is taking out all the essences of Koran
which are in balance.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.870
Koran talks of balance: talks of that you
must have balance – equilibrium.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.990
It talks of it, and so he has taken that point.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:58.499
And now he is taking out all that creates
imbalances in the Islamic book called ‘Koran’,

00:12:58.499 --> 00:13:00.709
which people have used for imbalances.

00:13:00.709 --> 00:13:06.589
On one point you can show how they have gone,
deviated, from their path.

00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:09.620
‘Deviated’ means – they have gone into
imbalances.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.760
For example Christianity now: you can take
it very clearly that they didn’t use Ganesha’s

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.519
principle there at all.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:39.100
But all throughout it’s written that you
have to look after yourself in a moral way.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.700
Now in the Old Testament it is written: ‘Thou
shalt not commit adultery’.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.279
But Christ has made it even subtler – very
subtle – because He’s at Agnya controlling

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:49.279
the eyes.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:53.189
So he said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes."

00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:59.439
But the Christians have crossed all the limits
of adultery, all the limits.

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:04.519
I mean, I don’t know to what limit they
are going to go now, I mean really they have

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:13.730
gone amuck, the way they are going into this
kind of experimentation.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.389
And then what will happen to your children?

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:18.360
What will happen to your society?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.779
That’s what is happening now, in complete
imbalance.

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:33.480
Completely in imbalance, all these societies,
where they are using adultery as a style of

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.519
life.

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:41.850
What Christ has said, just the opposite they
are doing.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:47.130
Same as Shri Krishna has said that in everybody
resides the Spirit.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.610
Then everybody is just the same.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.339
So how can you have caste system?

00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:55.740
You can have at the most caste system according
to the work that you are doing.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.779
But you can’t have caste system according
to the birth.

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:02.779
You cannot have.

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:04.999
I mean it’s so plain, clean.

00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:11.839
You can see it so clearly, He has said it,
that everybody has got the Spirit.

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:14.980
So everybody can ascend.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.920
Christ has said the same thing.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.709
He has not said that women don’t have the
Spirit or men have the Spirit.

00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:24.499
And look at the way that these people are
talking that they cannot have ordination.

00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:30.600
Of course ordination itself is humbug, but
still.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.610
But to deprive someone of certain rights because
they are women or men is something absolutely,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.970
I should say, nonsense.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:44.839
It has no relevance to dharma, because ‘dharma’
means balance.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:46.160
‘Dharma’ means balance.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.290
The one who has balance is the man who is
dharmic, who is in the centre.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:16:01.870
If you are in the centre, say you take, say
a balance, this called as balancing.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.660
But in Hindi it’s called as taraju (तराजू).

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.889
Now you hold it in the hand.

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:07.139
It’s called as balance, can you imagine?

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.709
You hold it in the centre.

00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:13.129
The centre of gravity of that balance is in
the centre.

00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:17.999
Now if you go more on this side this will
go down, or you go on this side it will go

00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:18.999
down.

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:25.450
But if you are at the gravity point you cannot
move this side or that side.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.760
Can you imagine the gravity is coming from
Mother Earth!

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.480
And Mother Earth has made Shri Ganesha.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:41.089
So this gravity point within us is to be maintained
and this gravity comes very natural to human

00:16:41.089 --> 00:16:42.089
beings.

00:16:42.089 --> 00:16:43.480
It’s not to be adopted or anything.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:50.709
If [in] childhood, if children are told about
their gravity, about their dignity, about

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:59.189
their greatness, they will immediately develop
it with a great pride that, “We are something

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:04.010
special and that we have to have this gravity
within us."

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:09.690
Now this gravity gives you a kind of an attraction.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:15.560
Anybody who is grave, doesn’t mean that
you pull a big face, it never means that.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:22.750
But gravity means that you are not disturbed
easily by any turmoil or anything.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:28.220
Gravity means so many things as you can see,
from Shri Ganesha’s character.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:33.390
Gravity means you are the one who is standing
in the centre.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:43.640
A person who sees everything and doesn’t
get disturbed, doesn’t get tempted, is self-contented,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:55.530
doesn’t ask for anything, doesn’t need
anything, doesn’t take revenge, forgives.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.901
Because he has no way to get out of his gravity.

00:17:58.901 --> 00:18:00.690
He is just bound there.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:05.640
Now somebody takes a revenge and runs away:
“Alright, go away!”

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.260
If somebody tries to trouble him: “Alright,
go away!”

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.220
Because he can’t run out of that gravity
point.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.950
That other person has lost his balance but
he can’t run after that person who is in

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.950
imbalance.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.450
So he doesn’t run after that person who
has done wrong.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.160
He says, “Alright, he has done wrong?

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.610
Have pity on him let him do that."

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.200
He doesn’t run after that person.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.590
He is standing there.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:34.690
And his standing there itself is sufficient
to frighten others, and to destroy others.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.550
Because he’s standing at a point where he
cannot be destroyed.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.140
But the others are running towards destruction.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.030
So what’s the use of running after him,
getting yourself also destroyed?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:54.960
Such a person who has achieved that balance
sees others as something to be pitied, because

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.780
he sees they are on the verge of falling down.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.380
I am here nicely settled down, but they are
on the verge of falling down.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.960
They may try to tell him, they may try to
help him.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.020
They may try to do everything for that person,
because they can see that person is going

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.020
to fall down.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.930
But if that person doesn’t want to take
to balance you cannot force it.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.580
So the Ganesha’s greatest quality is that
he has gravity.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.740
With that gravity he sits down on this Mother
Earth.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:38.060
Now, because this is a country of Ganesha,
the Australians must have balance, should,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.060
naturally have.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.060
But they don’t.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.060
I must tell you, they don’t.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:46.530
And my experience of Australians before I
started Sahaja Yoga has been terrific, I must

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.340
tell you that (laughing)!

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:58.590
If an Australian starts drinking, only person
who can compete with him is a Russian!

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.440
And then they talk so irrelevantly, you don’t
know how to deal with them.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:10.150
If they shake your hand, then you will feel,
after some time, you have lost it.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:16.300
Everything they do in such a big way that
I couldn’t understand why is it [that] they

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.260
shake your hand so badly.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.670
So C.P. said, “You see they have lots of
jungles."

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:28.210
He tried to console me, “and there are lots
of animals and things and that’s why you

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.690
see they shake hands like that."

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.100
I said, “No animal shakes hands you see!”

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.430
How have they learned from the animals?

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.800
I can’t get this explanation alright!

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.380
On the contrary they are extremely gentle.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.340
Animals are extremely gentle with each other.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.010
So how this kind of shaking hands has started?

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.930
And only people who can beat them are Greeks
who shake hands in a very funny way that really

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.810
you get a big jerk!

00:20:54.810 --> 00:21:08.410
So I felt that the country of Ganesha, should
be absolutely in balance and in one tune with

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.990
this Paramachaitanya.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.360
You see the animals who live in the jungles.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.560
You have so much of nature.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:23.760
See these trees – they grow up to a point
and they do not aggress others, they do not

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.460
fight, they do not have groups.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.460
Nothing of the kind.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:34.750
Just they grow, accept whatever is given to
them, live with it happily, and if they have

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:40.400
to be destroyed they accept the destruction.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.870
But they are absolutely in contact with God,
or under the complete control of God almighty.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:52.050
That’s why animals are called as ‘pashu’,
means pash, means ‘under the control of

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.050
God’.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.740
While we have got freedom.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.780
Even we have got freedom.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.060
Still this is the country of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:06.550
[What] the nature should really imbibe within
you, is the balance.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:13.920
And the balance should come in such a manner
that your whole character, your own temperament

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.610
should show that balance within you.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:25.010
But what I find is the most difficult thing
in Australia that there are groups and people

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:30.200
fight and lots of problems with that.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:38.480
It surprises me – how can [it be], in the
country of Ganesha, where there are ganas?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.360
All Ganas are here.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.530
If ganas start fighting with each other what
will happen?

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.460
Supposing the anti-bodies in our body start
fighting with each other then what will happen

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.270
to our body?

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.570
So you are like ganas!

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.700
You are specially blessed people to be born
in this special country.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:04.820
And, after all these achievements that you
have made, if you are going to take these

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:12.220
absolutely nonsensical things of the countries
which are over developed, have lost their

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:18.110
balance, then what’s the use of being born
in this Ganesha’s land?

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:23.160
In this Ganesha’s land you have to have
a complete balance within yourself.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:30.030
That’s what I expect from the Sahaja Yogis
of Australia: that they have to give to the

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:35.010
whole world the sense of balance of Shri Ganesha.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:43.620
On the contrary it is being reported to me
that, every time we have our programme in

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:59.000
Ganapatipule, people have noticed that there
are groups in Australia, that people are not

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.930
clean hearted; they talk ill of others.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:11.120
And they told me, warned me, “Mother be
on the look out, why it is happening.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.650
They speak something behind their backs and
try to convince the people of other countries

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.770
about it."

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.970
Of course they being so clean that they don’t
like it.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.820
They don’t want to hear it from Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.640
They don’t want to hear against anyone who
are Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.750
So they informed me, “Mother this is a very
serious thing!”

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.500
And certain things [that] they have told me
are really very serious.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.930
So now we have to first decide that we should
bear no grudge to anyone.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.170
How can you bear a grudge to anyone?

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.510
We have to be forgiving.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.750
All the time forgiving.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.430
Something, somebody has said it, alright,
doesn’t matter.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.361
As it is, English language, you know, is not
a very soft language, it’s not a very soft

00:24:55.361 --> 00:25:00.630
language, and in that if you say something
one should not mind.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.950
It’s a very humorous language but the humour
sometimes cuts you out.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.480
But it doesn’t matter.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.700
That’s the defect of the language.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:17.590
But that doesn’t mean that you should say
harsh words to anyone, or you should be indifferent

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.590
to anyone.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.230
Do your duties to your children, to your wife,
to your husband.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.210
Indifference to anyone, itself, is tremendous
harshness.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:30.270
For the small thing if a woman gets angry
and doesn’t talk to her husband, or if the

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:35.360
husband neglects the wife, and doesn’t bother
about her, looking after her, caring for her,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.430
then it’s a crime.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.200
According to Sahaja Yoga it’s a wrong thing
to do.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.840
Because you must have balance you must have
softness of nature.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:51.160
You should talk very softly to others and
be kind and nice.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.240
Just find out if you are doing that or not.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.100
Then between the group [also].

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.680
It’s a question of using the power of love.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.140
We have no other power: we have no money power,
we have no this political power, economic

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.140
power, nothing.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.760
What power we have got is the power of love.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:18.390
For that, when you talk to each other, one
has to talk in a soft manner; extremely soft

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.430
and kind manner.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:28.540
You’ll be surprised: I must say, in my experience,
I have found Germans like that!

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.550
Extremely soft to each other, extremely gentle!

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:37.990
I mean I can’t believe these Germans who
killed the whole world once upon a time!

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:43.250
Now in Sahaja Yoga suddenly they have realise,
“What a horrible thing we have done!”

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:48.070
And Sahaja Yogis, they are extremely gentle.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:58.190
You scratch anyone and you will be surprised
that the, all of them, all the Sahaja Yogis

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.980
are extremely, extremely gentle.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:09.820
While the Italians I used to think would be
very gentle, because they have art, culture,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.710
everything and they produce such nice things.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.310
But on the contrary I find that Germans can
beat them.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.610
It’s beautiful German Sahaja Yogis there
have.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.870
They hate neo-fascism.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.700
They said, “We have had enough of it!

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.960
We had such a bad name all over the world!

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.210
If they know we are Germans nobody wants to
look at us!”

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.790
And what are these people doing?

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:36.760
So they have become extremely gentle, from
one end to another end.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:44.220
And this gentleness really brings them out,
because everybody is so surprised that Germans

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.010
could be that gentle, so sweet.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:53.930
Now look at Shri Ganesh – how gentle he
is, how sweet he is and how innocent he is.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:28:03.080
His ways are so gentle: how he works on you,
how he makes things for you, how gently he

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.880
does all these things.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.360
Like see now you cannot see this flower opening.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.380
In my room you put some flowers and they started
growing.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.660
You can’t see the growth.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.390
If you put a camera of a special nature which
can record, you can see it growing there,

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.750
but you can’t see [normally].

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.460
You can’t see a tree growing.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.940
You can’t see a flower opening out.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:33.100
You just can’t see anything that is growing
by nature, by Shri Ganesh.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.860
He does it so gently.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.020
Now also he will not grow trees one on top
of another!

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.660
But in such a way that they all get the suns
rays.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:48.430
Just like a great mother, I must say, the
way, gently, he does everything.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.460
Every leaf is made differently – what an
art!

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.460
Every leaf!

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.400
In the whole world you cannot find exactly
the same leaf whether it is from Australia

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.940
or from America.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.910
The leaf, if you see it under a microscope,
will differ.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.260
Every leaf!

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.270
Can you imagine?

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:13.800
Look at his work, how gently he puts everything,
how gently he works.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:23.510
And while we are living on the grounds of
Shri Ganesha how gentle we should be.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.070
And in dealing with people we should be extremely,
extremely gentle.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:33.450
We should show that we are Ganesha’s special
ganas.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.360
That’s what I feel about Australians.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.510
We have had some mishaps, I know, doesn’t
matter.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.510
But that’s alright.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.260
A few of them were like that.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:53.450
But all of you should really learn to be very
loving, gentle, kind and concerned.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:30:01.940
Small, small things can make people happy,
very happy.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:06.070
And I try all these tricks myself and you
should also try these tricks.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.380
It’s very simple.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:15.450
One day I gave a sari to a lady, so she said,
“Mother how do you know I love this colour?”

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.970
“Because I have seen you mostly wearing
this colour.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.420
So I know you love this colour."

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.570
“But did you see me?”

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.710
“Yes, of course, I saw you."

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:29.470
So these small things: she was so heartened;
she felt that, “Mother notices me,” Because

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.530
I have seen you.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.440
I mean I see all of you.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.180
But I know about all of you because I am concerned
and bothered about you.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.780
And everyone I know where you stand, what’s
wrong with you, what should be done, what

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.900
you like, what you don’t like.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.660
There’s no harm in doing that.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.930
It’s much better to have a better rapport
when you understand what’s the problem is.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.840
I immediately know what’s the problem.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.310
I know a person who is dominating, I know
a person who is mistrusting.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.310
Everything I know.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:10.110
And gradually I try to tell them in a very
gentle way that, “This should be corrected."

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.540
But you need not tell them.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:16.190
For you there’s a very simple method of
giving bandhans and improving people.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:22.210
You don’t have to worry about doing something
very drastic about it or to tell them on the

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.210
face.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.690
Only thing if you give bandhan to them you
can do it.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:38.000
Now, about this, how to develop this balance,
is the big problem and I was thinking that

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.220
I will talk about this later on to people
in details: how to develop the balance in

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.220
our character, in our nature.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.520
Of course meditation does help you to be in
the centre.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.050
But, still, sometimes we just slip off.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:32:01.280
And there is a way by which you can really
make your character in such a way that you’ll

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.970
remain in balance all the time.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:10.460
On the contrary when there will be a crisis
you will just jump on to your gravity point.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.610
That should happen.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:12.910
If that happens no problem.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.990
It happens with me.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:21.050
If I see any crisis anywhere, in Sahaja Yoga,
in my family life, or anywhere, immediately

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.340
I know that I am deep down on to my gravity.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:30.140
And from there I can see everything so clearly
and then I solve the problem.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.810
That is what one has to understand, that you
have to jump on your gravity.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.540
And then it’s not a relative position.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.530
To be on the gravity is not a relative position.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:47.760
It is not that you have to compare yourself
with others.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.650
No you don’t have to.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:55.090
You don’t have to think that I’ll be losing
this or I’ll be gaining this.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.090
Nothing of the kind.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.200
You are there on your own position.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.600
You are there.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.390
You are in charge of yourself.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.740
So you don’t worry.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:10.720
There is no jealousy, there’s no fear, there’s
no kind of a temptation, just you are there.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.960
You are not bothered.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.850
Sometimes I have seen the leaders are worried
about their leadership sometimes.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:27.980
Now leadership is just hocus-pocus, I must
tell you.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.410
If somebody says Mother you become the leader
I’ll say, “No.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.670
I know.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:34.950
I know that joke!”

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.370
So it’s a joke.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.710
Leadership is a joke you see.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:44.780
And if you know it’s a joke, then only you
will work it out better.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.550
Because, there’s nothing like hierarchy
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.950
As you know, we are all one, the same.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.100
We cannot say that hands are better than feet
and the feet is better than this – nothing

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.130
of the kind.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:03.380
In the same way everything is very important,
and everything circulates like the blood cells.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.159
So we do not say that this blood cell is good
and that blood cell is bad.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:12.049
Or this blood cell is higher, that blood cell
is higher.

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:15.039
In the same way everybody is circulating.

00:34:15.039 --> 00:34:17.240
So one should not have any fear.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.190
Also fear of the leader should not be there.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.139
There’s no need to fear the leader.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.039
If you are on your gravity you keep to it.

00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:25.179
He will understand you.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:30.139
As long as leader is on the gravity he’ll
be there, as soon as he goes away from the

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.329
gravity he’ll go away himself.

00:34:33.329 --> 00:34:39.179
So you stand on your own gravity point and
nobody can disturb you.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.740
You should have no fear, nothing.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.829
Nothing to bother in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:45.230
As it is you are all saints.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.619
What is there to bother?

00:34:46.619 --> 00:34:54.249
The whole ganas, all the angels, all this
All-pervading Power is looking after you.

00:34:54.249 --> 00:35:01.330
Yesterday we saw a kind of a light, miraculous
light, following us on both the sides of the

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.330
car.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.920
Especially on my side there was such a lot
of light following.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.910
Just giving [an] indication that it’s alright,
this is Ganesha’s place and here things

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.660
are going to work out.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:21.440
So you are placed so well, you have so many
powers within yourself and which you can express

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.369
very well.

00:35:23.369 --> 00:35:25.859
Fearlessly you can have it within yourself.

00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:31.140
Anybody who tries to trouble you will be looked
after by this All-pervading Power, you don’t

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.210
have to do anything about it.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.160
So try to see: are you in balance in any way.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.349
Some people are too much attached to their
family and some people are detached.

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:46.089
Too much attachment to family is also wrong.

00:35:46.089 --> 00:35:47.810
What is the need to be attached so much?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.200
You’ll spoil your children.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.670
When they grow up they hit you back.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.789
So best is to keep them in balance, have a
detached attitude towards life.

00:35:56.789 --> 00:36:03.749
And this detached attitude, as I had told
you, is like the sap in the tree which goes

00:36:03.749 --> 00:36:05.499
to all the places.

00:36:05.499 --> 00:36:11.599
If it is surplus it can evaporate or it can
go down, but it doesn’t stick to anything,

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:18.369
because if it sticks to anything, that involvement
will kill that tree and also kill that part,

00:36:18.369 --> 00:36:20.880
that flower, where it is sticking on to.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:27.590
So we see that attached love is the death
of the love.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:36.210
So we have to have a proper understanding
of this detached love, where you stand on

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:44.559
your gravity and you have concern about everyone,
you think about everyone.

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:57.839
In case you find that somebody is not alright,
you don’t lose your balance, but get that

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:01.210
person in the balance.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.980
If you start losing your balance then how
can you get back that person.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:16.069
And in that way you will lose all your hatred,
all your anger, all your lust, or what you

00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:21.460
can call, all your competition, all that.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.183
Because you stand in your own dignity.

00:37:23.183 --> 00:37:26.900
You don’t want [a] certificate from anyone.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:32.619
You don’t want any praising from anyone.

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:34.660
You just know that you are there.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.180
And you are self-contented.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:41.890
Then it’s not also necessary that, “Mother
must give me a special audience!”

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.400
It’s all ego.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.509
“I must see Mother!

00:37:45.509 --> 00:37:47.460
I have to see her privately!”

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.890
What is the need to see me privately?

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:53.470
I am never private I am available every time
to you, all the time.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:38:00.880
So all these things are coming out of the
ignorance and out of the fact that you are

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.740
not on your gravity point.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:09.280
So today, to begin with, we have this Ganesh
puja where we all should, in our heart, think

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.710
what is our gravity point and [on] that we
have to stand very firm.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.339
May God bless you.
