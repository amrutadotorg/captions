00:01.960 --> 00:05.880
Today I am going to talk to you about attention.

00:20.480 --> 00:31.160
What is attention, what is the movement of attention

00:31.280 --> 00:40.920
and what are the ways and methods of raising our attention.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.760
Keep it in broad ways. Alright?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.800
But when I am saying all these things

00:48.920 --> 00:51.720
you must know that I am talking to you individually

00:51.840 --> 00:53.360
– it’s not about others.

00:53.480 --> 00:58.680
Always the first thing human beings do is, when I am speaking to you,

00:58.800 --> 01:02.720
you try to find out about who Mataji is speaking!

01:02.840 --> 01:07.119
This is the best way of putting your attention onto something else.

01:07.239 --> 01:09.852
If you put your attention to yourself that,

01:09.973 --> 01:12.759
“This is for me and me and me alone,”

01:12.880 --> 01:17.480
then it will have an effect, because these [words of mine] are mantras.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.400
And that’s why it is wasted

01:20.520 --> 01:25.400
because whatever is given to you is thrown onto another person.

01:26.200 --> 01:35.640
So the attention, that you have, is the only way to know the reality.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.200
Your own attention is important,

01:39.320 --> 01:42.560
not the attention of others or your attention on others!

01:42.680 --> 01:45.000
This must be clearly understood.

01:45.160 --> 01:48.280
If you understand this point that the whole thing

01:48.400 --> 01:51.160
is to be consumed by you,

01:51.280 --> 01:55.320
through your attention to raise yourself to a higher situation,

01:55.440 --> 01:58.000
it will work out. Otherwise, it is like giving food to you

01:58.120 --> 02:00.280
and going to another person who is getting nourished,

02:00.400 --> 02:01.800
while you are getting nothing.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.360
And that person also may not be able get nourished,

02:06.480 --> 02:10.600
because he doesn’t know that you are throwing it to that person.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.200
So today, as I am going to speak to you about attention,

02:14.320 --> 02:20.960
you should know that your attention should absorb all that I am saying.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.440
It is not meant for anybody else.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.480
You better sit in thoughtless awareness, that’s the best way,

02:27.600 --> 02:32.000
so that it goes into you. Otherwise it’s like a lecture, you know.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.400
That you listen to me has no effect.

02:34.520 --> 02:41.160
Every lecture will transform you because, after all, I am speaking.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.800
But because you always think of others

02:44.920 --> 02:47.160
and you think of your problems all the time

02:47.440 --> 02:51.280
– something nonsensical is going on, about which you are worried –

02:51.400 --> 02:53.440
and the attention is so overloaded

02:53.560 --> 02:57.040
that whatever is said to you doesn’t go into you.

02:57.160 --> 03:01.120
So, just now, utilise it by being attentive and knowing

03:01.240 --> 03:05.200
that all these nonsensical things have no value.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.280
It’s your attention that has to come up and has to grow.

03:15.760 --> 03:29.680
So, attention is the whole of the canvas of your being

03:29.800 --> 03:33.360
– is a complete canvas, is the attention.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.880
Complete canvas of your being is the attention.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.640
How much you have gone into it, how much you have discovered it,

03:41.760 --> 03:46.640
how far you have raised it is a different point.

03:49.040 --> 03:55.880
Attention is Chitta and God is attention.

03:56.600 --> 04:01.280
How far your attention has been enlightened is a different point.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.280
But your attention is God

04:09.520 --> 04:14.960
– if you become enlightened to that extent.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.560
It is like a canvas.

04:18.680 --> 04:24.840
You can say it is like a canvas which is spread out for a film,

04:25.960 --> 04:29.339
and whatever aptitudes

04:29.460 --> 04:34.160
or, you can say, the drags or movements, your attention has,

04:34.280 --> 04:38.320
shows on that canvas.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.880
I don’t know what is the word for ‘vritti’ in English language.

04:45.440 --> 04:51.520
It’s not aptitude, but a person gets prone to, or his attention is dragged to

04:51.640 --> 04:55.160
– I don’t know [if] there is a word like that in English language – vritti.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.000
Can you suggest any word?

04:59.680 --> 05:08.760
So our attention is just a pure, completely pure canvas

05:10.000 --> 05:16.120
and is acted upon by the three gunas we have, to begin with.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.760
And the three gunas come to you, as you know,

05:20.880 --> 05:26.400
one from your past, one from your future sense and one from the present.

05:30.520 --> 05:37.440
Now, whatever have been your experiences about

05:37.560 --> 05:42.600
a particular thing or a particular occasion,

05:43.080 --> 05:49.720
so far, is completely recorded in your memory.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.400
For example, if you see the black colour:

05:54.800 --> 06:00.640
all that goes with the black colour is recorded in your memory.

06:00.760 --> 06:07.680
As soon as you see this black colour, quite a lot of it comes up.

06:09.120 --> 06:15.640
That means, as soon as you see this with your attention,

06:15.760 --> 06:21.000
the attention gets muddled up, or you can say the attention gets coloured

06:21.120 --> 06:25.760
with all the memories about this black colour.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.778
And then your action takes place

06:30.899 --> 06:36.149
according to the way your attention is affected.

06:38.480 --> 06:45.480
For example, just now something was burned by these flames.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.000
Now, all of you became aware of it.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.800
Next time whenever you will see a flame,

06:53.920 --> 06:58.440
first thing [that] will happen will be that you will be cautious about it.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.480
It is not going to happen again,

07:00.600 --> 07:03.560
but the whole memory will come to you

07:03.680 --> 07:08.240
and you will try to be cautious or warn others,

07:08.360 --> 07:14.080
because your attention will become aware of that

07:14.200 --> 07:21.240
as soon as you will see that, because that canvas of your attention

07:21.360 --> 07:27.640
itself will start throwing out these pictures, out of itself,

07:27.760 --> 07:32.520
through your past experiences, on to the canvas.

07:32.640 --> 07:37.560
This is a living canvas.

07:38.440 --> 07:47.200
Or may be that if you have got some ideas which you have premeditated,

07:47.320 --> 07:52.160
or thought of, of the future.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.240
For example, you must have thought of somebody that,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.840
“If I meet that man I will tell him like this.”

07:58.960 --> 08:02.567
As soon as you will meet that man,

08:02.688 --> 08:07.320
your attention will start bubbling out with those ideas

08:07.440 --> 08:09.518
that are coming about this man,

08:09.639 --> 08:11.800
and you will start addressing to him accordingly.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.840
It’s all stored up within you,

08:13.960 --> 08:17.480
whether it is about the future or about the past.

08:17.600 --> 08:25.320
It’s given out of the attention through that bubbling process

08:25.760 --> 08:29.880
which depends on your dragging nature, where are you dragged.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.160
That’s called as vritti, but I don’t know what you call it in English language.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.440
I do not know what is the, what you are prone to (tendency).

08:39.280 --> 08:42.960
Vritti is a very neutral word. It doesn’t mean anything bad.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.280
It means where you are drawn to.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.280
Vritti means a temperament by which you are drawn to.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.520
And whatever is your temperament, it acts like that.

08:52.640 --> 09:00.040
For example, if you see a man walking, say, blindly

09:00.160 --> 09:02.680
– he cannot see things –

09:02.800 --> 09:06.360
one person may get angry with that person,

09:06.480 --> 09:09.160
another may have pity for that person,

09:09.280 --> 09:12.680
third may come forward to help him out.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.640
It’s the vritti, it’s the temperament,

09:14.760 --> 09:19.360
that you have developed through your three gunas.

09:22.640 --> 09:30.600
That’s why this attention becomes identified with you.

09:30.840 --> 09:39.000
And when you are identified with this, your vritti, your temperaments,

09:39.160 --> 09:46.800
then you are still in a misidentified area.

09:46.920 --> 09:53.320
Let us take a case of somebody who has been possessed before.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.840
Now, coming to Sahaja Yoga his possession goes away.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.640
But the memory remains in the brain that he was possessed.

10:04.760 --> 10:09.720
And [if] the memory is stronger in a person, left side is stronger,

10:09.840 --> 10:13.480
then that memory lingers on,

10:13.600 --> 10:17.880
and as soon as that person comes in contact with anyone

10:18.000 --> 10:23.080
which has got something to do with the past possession, it clicks.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.320
And the whole thing starts coming into you bubbling out

10:26.440 --> 10:30.040
and you think you are again possessed.

10:31.360 --> 10:36.040
It is the memory which gives you [this reaction]. It’s a myth.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.600
It’s the memory that tells you, “Oh, you are again possessed!”

10:41.720 --> 10:46.480
Because your left side is weak, means you always live in your memory.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.960
Your memory is stronger than yourself.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.703
If you could make yourself stronger than your memory,

10:53.824 --> 10:55.951
nothing can possess you.

11:02.880 --> 11:09.080
But after you get your Realisation,

11:09.200 --> 11:15.120
you are not still identified with that state of mind

11:15.600 --> 11:21.480
in which you see your ego and superego as myths.

11:24.280 --> 11:29.120
Still you get caught up into your ego and superego,

11:29.240 --> 11:35.120
and that’s why your attention is still in a mess.

11:36.560 --> 11:42.440
In a pure simple way of attention in an innocent child,

11:44.560 --> 11:47.840
he sees everything in pratyaksha,

11:47.960 --> 11:52.120
means in actual experiencing of something – for a child –

11:52.240 --> 11:54.240
because he has no memory.

11:54.360 --> 12:00.680
So he’ll have to burn his hand to feel that this burns.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.360
He has to touch something cold to know that it is cold.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.680
His memory is not yet built up.

12:06.960 --> 12:15.240
So into the actual experiencing of it he lives.

12:16.640 --> 12:21.680
But that actual experiencing becomes memory.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.200
And once the memory is built up stronger,

12:24.320 --> 12:28.480
the whole personality is affected by memory.

12:28.600 --> 12:33.000
All the conditioning of all kinds come through that;

12:33.120 --> 12:38.880
your reading, even the whole atmosphere can come to you.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.240
You see, sometimes you smell a particular soap,

12:43.360 --> 12:45.880
or say a rose, you smell it –

12:46.000 --> 12:50.680
then all the memories of smelling such a rose, sometimes,

12:50.800 --> 12:53.520
comes to you and you may feel really elated sometimes,

12:53.640 --> 12:55.720
maybe sometimes, maybe, or sometimes very unhappy,

12:55.840 --> 12:58.840
whatever may be the situation.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.160
So you may feel happy or unhappy.

13:03.280 --> 13:07.480
Because, whatever experiences you have had,

13:07.600 --> 13:10.120
has given you a memory.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.880
This memory might have given you a superego,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.960
or might have given you a ego.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.600
This scanning might have taken place.

13:19.720 --> 13:23.440
If it has been a ego and a superego,

13:23.560 --> 13:28.360
then may be that, if it was ego you must have felt happy.

13:28.480 --> 13:33.280
If it is satisfying to your ego you feel very happy.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.280
If it is not, if it is superego, if you are suppressed by this,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.280
then you feel very unhappy.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.120
So both things like happiness or unhappiness

13:42.240 --> 13:47.600
are the states where you are still in the myth,

13:48.480 --> 13:52.560
still the myth exists. You have to still go beyond.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.520
So if you feel happy about some situation, you should know you

13:55.640 --> 13:59.200
are only happy before Realisation,

13:59.320 --> 14:05.400
because it is giving some support to your ego to bloat.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.800
And if you are unhappy, then you should know that

14:10.920 --> 14:14.400
there is some sort of a suppression on your ego

14:14.520 --> 14:16.840
and there’s a superego developing.

14:16.960 --> 14:23.880
So both the situations have been of no help to you,

14:25.560 --> 14:28.400
of no help to you for your growth,

14:28.520 --> 14:32.680
except that both these institutions develop so much

14:32.800 --> 14:39.480
that you are away from the real experiencing.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.360
The real experiencing stops

14:44.480 --> 14:49.680
because your attention is so much muddled up.

14:50.760 --> 14:55.680
So on one side if you move – on the left hand side –

14:56.320 --> 15:02.560
your attention is muddled up with fear, with pain,

15:02.680 --> 15:12.600
with unhappiness, with hopelessness, dejection.

15:14.520 --> 15:20.440
The other side, if you indulge too much on to the right hand side

15:20.560 --> 15:22.360
– little bit also –

15:22.480 --> 15:30.440
you start getting elated, excited, over-dominating.

15:32.160 --> 15:38.600
The colour of the left side is blue.

15:38.720 --> 15:43.320
And the blue colour starts changing to the black.

15:44.120 --> 15:50.760
While on the right hand side it is, to begin with, yellow,

15:50.880 --> 15:53.360
light yellow or you can say golden,

15:53.480 --> 15:57.720
then yellow, then orange and then red.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.480
So you go to aggression on the right hand side.

16:01.600 --> 16:09.200
On the left hand side you go into a complete state of

16:10.240 --> 16:11.600
entropy, you can call it,

16:11.720 --> 16:15.640
or a state where you are separated from yourself

16:15.760 --> 16:19.120
into a complete frozen state.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.480
So [on] one side you become completely frozen,

16:21.600 --> 16:25.240
on the other side you become completely heated up.

16:26.920 --> 16:33.760
Both these things are, again, movement on the wrong direction.

16:33.880 --> 16:37.320
Even in the centre when the attention is kept

16:37.440 --> 16:42.560
– that you keep your attention more in the centre –

16:42.680 --> 16:49.480
there also, because it’s a very sensitive point, it doesn’t stay there.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.120
For example,

16:52.680 --> 16:59.200
when we, say, use fire, we can use it for burning the house.

16:59.600 --> 17:04.280
In the same way we can use it for creating smoke.

17:04.400 --> 17:09.960
But we can also use this fire in its proper way, if we use it,

17:10.080 --> 17:15.640
in its proper proportion, for cooking the food [or] for giving us light.

17:15.760 --> 17:21.880
If it is too much, it can burn like a big fire.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
If it is too little, it can burn like smoke.

17:26.120 --> 17:29.200
But in the center when you know how to balance it,

17:29.320 --> 17:31.760
then you can use it for your own purpose

17:31.880 --> 17:39.000
– for cooking or for giving light, and then for a puja too.

17:40.920 --> 17:50.200
So in the same way when we really balance our gunas properly,

17:50.440 --> 17:56.200
then we become gradually the master of the whole situation.

17:58.880 --> 18:04.840
The attention doesn’t get dragged

18:04.960 --> 18:07.640
into things that we have been doing

18:07.760 --> 18:10.560
or that we have understood through our memories

18:10.680 --> 18:13.200
or through our experiences or whatever it is,

18:13.320 --> 18:16.840
and is not also dragged towards, too much, on the right hand side

18:16.960 --> 18:22.000
that we try to overpower, or try to dominate someone.

18:22.120 --> 18:27.200
Because if you move too much that side you have seen [that] it becomes blood.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.240
It is difficult for people to understand how,

18:30.360 --> 18:36.840
when people become very religious-minded, like now Iran,

18:37.120 --> 18:39.080
the movement is on the right

18:39.200 --> 18:44.440
– all the austerities, all that, everything – now bloodshed.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.520
Christians also did the same.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.800
Brahmins did the same in India.

18:50.920 --> 18:55.080
Buddhists did the same, even [though] they talked of nonviolence

18:55.200 --> 19:01.600
they got to bloodshed, because movement started [on the] right hand side.

19:01.720 --> 19:07.800
Left hand side movement will take you to very sly and dark methods.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.600
So right-handed sided people – like big nations

19:12.720 --> 19:15.880
who are supposed to be developed nations –

19:16.000 --> 19:19.280
they justify war.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.560
“We must have weapons to face each other.”

19:22.680 --> 19:25.800
But you all, each other, are the same people from God’s point of view!

19:25.920 --> 19:28.280
Why are you fighting?

19:29.402 --> 19:32.279
When God asks you, “Why are you fighting, what is the need?

19:32.400 --> 19:35.560
Why don’t you sit down properly and listen to each other?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.320
What are you fighting about?

19:37.440 --> 19:42.080
You are fighting about land. Is it your father’s land? It belongs to God!

19:42.200 --> 19:45.760
God has created this land. Why are you fighting?”

19:45.880 --> 19:48.720
But your attention is such that immediately you think,

19:48.840 --> 19:51.000
“Oh, this is my land, this is my motherland,

19:51.120 --> 19:53.480
this is my fatherland, this is my brotherland.”

19:53.600 --> 19:58.440
But what about your land which is within you? It’s not your own!

19:58.560 --> 20:00.864
So if you go on telling these people

20:00.985 --> 20:04.120
that we should have no war they will not listen.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.440
Realisation is the only way.

20:06.560 --> 20:10.480
By Realisation your attention gets higher

20:10.600 --> 20:15.560
and gets separated from that strata from where these things bubble in.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.360
Do you understand my point now?

20:18.480 --> 20:23.720
The strata goes higher, the attention goes higher, at a higher state.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.680
And these things [Inaudible]

20:27.800 --> 20:34.000
By right side movement you get vikshepa, confusion. First you get confusion.

20:34.120 --> 20:38.400
Every intellectual, whatever brilliant he may be, he is confused.

20:38.520 --> 20:43.040
And the more confused he is, the more he asserts himself

20:43.160 --> 20:46.720
because he is confused, he’s not sure of himself, so he asserts,

20:46.840 --> 20:48.600
“This is the thing; this is the thing.”

20:48.720 --> 20:51.520
I mean, if it is so, why should you assert it?

20:51.640 --> 20:53.960
But he goes on asserting, “This is the thing!”

20:54.080 --> 20:57.360
Then understand that now he is going towards lunatic asylum – absolutely!

20:57.480 --> 21:01.800
And the way he asserts, and goes on talking about it,

21:01.920 --> 21:07.680
all the time, that means he is not sure.

21:07.880 --> 21:12.400
He becomes like a possessed personality.

21:12.760 --> 21:18.240
When he explains everything through his brains that

21:18.360 --> 21:21.600
“This is the thing. This is correct. We must all do, this is what…”

21:21.720 --> 21:24.840
and he convinces many others who are confused like him.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.800
They depend on him. He becomes a leader because, you see,

21:27.920 --> 21:29.280
they are much more confused

21:29.400 --> 21:32.360
and they find somebody who is not so much confused outwardly

21:32.480 --> 21:35.880
[so] they stick on to him, and all of them get to war

21:36.000 --> 21:42.160
or some sort of a bloodshed or some sort of – they want to see blood.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.960
They become heartless, passionless, compassionless,

21:48.080 --> 21:52.120
you can say – compassionless, loveless people.

21:52.240 --> 21:57.720
The other movement is the blue side, is like the blue moonlight.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.160
So, for the romanticism starts.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.720
Sitting in the moonlight, you see!

22:03.840 --> 22:09.120
The ideas start coming from Lord Byron (laughter).

22:12.080 --> 22:15.760
And they come into your attention

22:15.880 --> 22:18.840
– then it becomes very strong passion with you.

22:18.960 --> 22:24.000
You think, “Oh, I am still, I have to find out my loves!”

22:24.120 --> 22:27.800
And you go on in search of your loves and this and that.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.440
These things are not really giving joy.

22:32.560 --> 22:38.560
That’s why so many poems have been written that,

22:38.720 --> 22:43.520
“Love is the most painful thing, it’s worse than death,”

22:43.640 --> 22:46.960
and all sorts of poems are written like that

22:47.080 --> 22:49.360
so why did you get into it?

22:49.480 --> 22:51.920
I mean, it’s already written down, books after books,

22:52.040 --> 22:54.200
still why do you get into it? (laughing)

22:54.320 --> 22:58.440
You are already warned about it that,

22:58.560 --> 23:03.000
“Don’t go after love, love is deception, love is this, that,

23:03.120 --> 23:08.440
it is very temporary, it is for the little while you get that.”

23:08.560 --> 23:11.560
By chance, if somebody could stop at a point

23:11.680 --> 23:16.440
by marrying somebody who is sweet enough and realise

23:16.560 --> 23:21.280
that love and marriage and all these things are in the centre,

23:21.400 --> 23:24.760
are like the fire in the kitchen,

23:24.880 --> 23:29.000
are like the fire in the temple:

23:29.120 --> 23:34.360
looks after it and doesn’t overdo something about it.

23:34.480 --> 23:39.080
Then maybe that this may be utilized.

23:39.200 --> 23:45.080
In the same way the right side movement of the Sun line.

23:45.200 --> 23:49.600
If people think that, yes, the sun is important,

23:49.720 --> 23:51.920
we have to have sun in the house,

23:52.040 --> 23:59.400
but you are not to become naked and insult the Sun and get your skin cancer!

23:59.520 --> 24:02.240
Sun is not for your skin cancer!

24:02.360 --> 24:07.560
But if you overdo it, also it is dangerous.

24:07.680 --> 24:13.640
A person who exposes himself too much to planning

24:13.760 --> 24:16.680
and doing that, and doing this, and doing all this,

24:16.800 --> 24:20.040
can land up into very great difficulties.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.720
So you have to balance that side also

24:22.840 --> 24:28.480
and this side and you have to be in the centre, in the equilibrium.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.680
Now this word ‘equilibrium’ doesn’t exist in our day-to-day life.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.120
It exists only in the fiction

24:35.240 --> 24:39.920
or may be in the so-called scientific research.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.240
But as far as human beings are concerned,

24:42.360 --> 24:45.560
they do not know what is equilibrium is.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.960
Because of this, the attention, though after Realisation

24:50.080 --> 24:55.240
comes up, still on the sides they just go down,

24:55.360 --> 24:59.840
this side or that side according to your vrittis.

24:59.960 --> 25:04.200
And when these identifications still act in them,

25:04.320 --> 25:11.160
they are prone to go down again in their attention

25:11.680 --> 25:16.520
and again start bubbling out the same thing as they had.

25:16.640 --> 25:23.560
Now one has to become lighter in one’s own mind

25:24.720 --> 25:29.640
and should think that, “We have dropped all that now why are we there?”

25:29.760 --> 25:34.840
One should become lighter with all that load flowing out,

25:34.960 --> 25:42.600
because you are here to raise your attention higher and higher

25:42.720 --> 25:45.640
so that you come up to a point

25:45.760 --> 25:50.960
where you become one with the attention of God.

25:51.280 --> 25:56.760
Already your attention is sparkled because through your attention

25:56.880 --> 25:58.720
you can see what’s wrong with you,

25:58.840 --> 26:01.360
you can see what’s wrong with others

26:01.480 --> 26:05.560
and you can see how far you are going with yourself.

26:05.680 --> 26:11.400
But the progress is retarded because you do not know that this attention

26:11.520 --> 26:16.640
is pure form and all that you get into this attention

26:16.760 --> 26:23.880
is a mythical stuff, is a myth.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.360
If you drop this myth gradually, treat everything as a myth

26:30.480 --> 26:34.680
and not depend on becoming unhappy or happy

26:34.800 --> 26:36.280
– just seeing the thing –

26:36.400 --> 26:38.200
[then] your attention will take a flight

26:38.320 --> 26:43.080
and it will be at a much higher level residing there.

26:43.560 --> 26:48.400
Instead of that, every moment you go this way or that way

26:48.520 --> 26:53.320
– it goes on like that – and the movement upwards is much less.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.680
Even in Sattvoguna, when you rise,

26:56.800 --> 27:00.240
you can go much worse in that condition also.

27:00.360 --> 27:04.400
For example, if you say that, “I am trying to be Sattwoguni.”

27:04.520 --> 27:13.600
In Sattwoguni it is that you start seeing everything,

27:13.720 --> 27:17.200
discriminating through your understanding

27:17.320 --> 27:19.560
– not through vibrations – through understanding:

27:19.680 --> 27:27.760
“Oh! Should we not somehow or the other take out our attention from here?”

27:27.880 --> 27:31.040
“Should we not give up this?”

27:31.160 --> 27:35.040
“Should we be charitable?” “Should we go and serve the people?”

27:35.160 --> 27:39.960
There are people who think, “Oh, we are going to do something great!”

27:40.080 --> 27:43.040
– like your Salvation Army.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.040
Let them be salvaged by themselves!

27:45.160 --> 27:47.800
I don’t know what salvation they are going to do.

27:47.920 --> 27:52.120
So these ideas – ideas, I am saying – of Sattvoguna,

27:52.240 --> 27:57.480
can also immobilise you and can really freeze you down once for all,

27:57.600 --> 28:02.480
and that also can work in you in such a sly manner,

28:02.600 --> 28:08.360
we can say, in such a secretive manner, that you won’t feel it.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.720
All these ideas of helping others, being charitable,

28:11.840 --> 28:14.800
“Let’s have a charity association!” – finished!

28:14.920 --> 28:19.880
Once you work in a charity association, your attention is finished there.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.960
But if your attention goes higher

28:24.080 --> 28:28.720
– say [as] my attention is. I am only nothing but charity! I mean what am I?

28:28.840 --> 28:35.840
It just flows. You just become the charity.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.033
So the difference between

28:39.154 --> 28:42.960
a person who is a realised and a not realised is this

28:43.080 --> 28:51.360
that the attention which was giving myth as reality to you

28:51.480 --> 28:53.960
is gone now, is gone higher.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.760
It can see that it is myth.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.400
Attention can clearly see that it is myth,

29:00.520 --> 29:06.480
and you can see that yourself and you can remove yourself from them.

29:10.056 --> 29:12.786
That, of course, I have to give you a push, no doubt,

29:12.907 --> 29:15.080
and I am working hard on that to give you a push.

29:15.200 --> 29:19.000
But you should also know that mythical things must be dropped out,

29:19.120 --> 29:22.400
otherwise you will not grow.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.200
All mythical things must be dropped out.

29:26.320 --> 29:29.640
And the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless awareness

29:29.760 --> 29:32.840
because as soon as you transcend these three gunas

29:32.960 --> 29:34.400
you become thoughtlessly aware.

29:34.520 --> 29:38.840
You have to cross Agya. Once you cross Agya, these three gunas,

29:38.960 --> 29:42.880
absolutely you go into a state where you are gunateet,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.920
you are beyond gunas.

29:47.280 --> 29:51.480
So you do not deliberately do anything,

29:51.600 --> 29:54.720
but it just works out.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.800
But analysis is one of the diseases of the West.

30:00.920 --> 30:05.720
What are you analysing? What are you analysing? You ask yourself.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.240
I feel like laughing at the whole analysis that goes on.

30:09.360 --> 30:13.160
See, they’ll sit down, take out a hair, splitting the hair into hundred!

30:13.280 --> 30:17.200
And great analysers are sitting down there!

30:18.040 --> 30:21.714
They cannot even say how the chromosomes

30:21.994 --> 30:24.113
have that spindle action

30:24.421 --> 30:29.519
and, I mean at that minute level the things are worked out.

30:31.436 --> 30:35.658
They cannot say how a cell divides.

30:38.046 --> 30:41.428
What are they analysing sitting down here?

30:42.423 --> 30:47.572
Now, they have analysed for a purpose – also done for God.

30:47.692 --> 30:51.696
Through their analysis now my things are recorded.

30:52.411 --> 30:55.224
Through their analysis I can go to the TV,

30:55.345 --> 30:58.726
if they allow me any time, because of analysis [it] doesn’t fit into me,

30:58.847 --> 31:03.910
they won’t allow, they may not, it might be expedited.

31:04.125 --> 31:06.873
But say, for example, if you had not discovered these things –

31:06.993 --> 31:09.313
for example take it like that –

31:10.530 --> 31:13.770
and the science was not discovered,

31:14.747 --> 31:18.457
your attention would have been at least better off.

31:20.441 --> 31:25.821
Because of science, your attention is also very much in confusion.

31:26.313 --> 31:33.926
So I don’t know which one to praise, whether the science or the primitiveness.

31:34.146 --> 31:37.002
When you raised yourself to science also,

31:37.123 --> 31:39.340
you got to another extreme as usual.

31:39.461 --> 31:43.814
Till you burnt out your complete attention, you were not satisfied.

31:43.934 --> 31:47.344
I mean if you had kept your balance in science also

31:47.465 --> 31:50.068
it would have helped, but the balance was lost there.

31:50.189 --> 31:51.963
Give anything to human beings

31:52.083 --> 31:56.754
and they know how to make the worst out of it.

31:56.874 --> 32:00.270
They will go to the extreme. You give them a horse, they cannot go

32:00.391 --> 32:04.648
ordinary trotting or galloping, they must have a double gallop,

32:04.768 --> 32:06.497
till they fall and die!

32:06.617 --> 32:11.014
Everything you see, they just are on the run all the time.

32:12.008 --> 32:15.566
So first thing is needed is to steady down yourself

32:15.686 --> 32:18.443
and tell yourself that, “Now all these mythical things

32:18.563 --> 32:21.682
I am not going to allow to come to my attention.”

32:23.063 --> 32:26.005
All these things are nothing but myths.

32:26.125 --> 32:30.016
But you are giving too much importance to myths.

32:30.224 --> 32:34.476
You are taking them bit so seriously. They are just mythical.

32:34.596 --> 32:38.226
Now, I mean, when you are realised now you laugh at people

32:38.346 --> 32:44.438
who just go mad over say, a moonlit night.

32:44.559 --> 32:47.747
Alright? But ask the fellow who is doing that,

32:47.867 --> 32:52.128
he’ll say, “You are heartless, you have no feelings!”

32:52.248 --> 32:57.159
He’ll give you a big poetry out of it.

32:57.587 --> 33:00.998
You go and see anyone of these people who are riding a high horse,

33:01.118 --> 33:03.032
who are at the helm of affairs,

33:03.152 --> 33:05.773
and you will feel like laughing at them.

33:05.893 --> 33:11.080
But they will think that, “You are useless, you are doing no work,

33:11.200 --> 33:15.584
you are good for nothing, you are just wasters.”

33:17.164 --> 33:20.750
So now for you, because you are enlightened now, is to understand

33:20.870 --> 33:28.710
that our attention has to move higher and higher, at a higher space.

33:28.860 --> 33:32.260
Now actually what has happened in Realisation?

33:32.380 --> 33:38.408
Your Kundalini has risen and has come up,

33:38.604 --> 33:46.903
just like, you can say, a small, thin hair, one hair,

33:49.133 --> 33:53.667
and that has broken your Sahastrara

33:54.167 --> 33:58.496
and now the grace is flowing into you.

33:59.330 --> 34:02.495
But it’s a very small movement that has taken place, of course

34:02.615 --> 34:06.813
which is a very difficult movement no doubt, but it has taken place.

34:08.718 --> 34:14.078
Now you have not expanded like this.

34:14.198 --> 34:18.300
Your chakras are only pierced in the centre,

34:18.420 --> 34:21.343
but the rest of the attention is still intact.

34:21.463 --> 34:27.277
Actually it is so intact, that you don’t even feel that it is pierced.

34:27.397 --> 34:33.507
Now you have to expand that, open it out,

34:33.816 --> 34:38.998
so that more strands of Kundalini can rise

34:39.434 --> 34:47.594
and your attention, which is in these centers, expands.

34:49.015 --> 34:53.695
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical on the sides.

34:53.816 --> 34:59.576
On every centre we have our attention,

34:59.696 --> 35:02.576
which is being enlightened in the centre

35:02.696 --> 35:06.075
through this Light passing through.

35:06.282 --> 35:11.437
But the Light is too small for the darkness that you have collected.

35:12.730 --> 35:15.257
Specially for the people of the West, I would say,

35:15.377 --> 35:19.897
your confusions, you must get rid of them.

35:21.637 --> 35:23.437
But still you identify.

35:23.557 --> 35:26.274
Because if I ask you anything [like], “How are you?”

35:26.394 --> 35:28.504
Means what?

35:30.364 --> 35:33.899
Means you are still confused.

35:34.019 --> 35:35.662
Alright?

35:39.019 --> 35:41.724
Confusion should go.

35:42.287 --> 35:47.226
One confusion was there that, “This is Realisation or not?”

35:47.346 --> 35:49.424
I hope that’s over now with you people.

35:49.544 --> 35:52.401
At least now you believe it is Self-realisation.

35:52.521 --> 35:55.785
I had to tell people, “No, you are self-realised now, you are!”

35:55.905 --> 35:59.101
Still they would jump up like [a] jack-in-the-box, you see.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.078
They’ll say, “No, we’re not Mother!

36:01.198 --> 36:03.205
How do you say this is Realisation?”

36:03.325 --> 36:07.783
“We expect this out of Realisation and that out of Realisation

36:07.903 --> 36:10.623
– that we’ll be flying out of the door if we are Realised,”

36:10.743 --> 36:12.543
or something nonsensical like that.

36:12.663 --> 36:14.941
Thank God, these ideas have gone away.

36:15.061 --> 36:20.661
But when we are Realised, there is Light that has come in us,

36:21.020 --> 36:25.006
we have to grow it only by separating our attention

36:25.126 --> 36:27.279
from the myths.

36:29.026 --> 36:31.695
It’s all mythical.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.380
I also play with you,

36:33.500 --> 36:39.307
because unless and until you are sure,

36:39.427 --> 36:46.521
I am not going to give you a wrong idea about yourself.

36:47.707 --> 36:52.614
I want to see how far still your attention is moving,

36:52.734 --> 36:57.294
and I know [that] still you are not sure,

36:58.500 --> 37:01.428
still you are not sure of yourself,

37:04.531 --> 37:09.784
that’s why the confidence is not there.

37:12.014 --> 37:17.125
First of all you have to learn how to drive, then you are tested.

37:17.245 --> 37:20.788
There will be five stones put together,

37:20.908 --> 37:25.266
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through

37:25.386 --> 37:28.239
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

37:28.359 --> 37:30.360
And you cannot do it.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.520
Why?

37:33.863 --> 37:38.569
That’s how he makes you a master.

37:39.719 --> 37:42.984
The mastery of your attention

37:43.104 --> 37:49.359
will come when you will start seeing that it is all a myth that upsets you.

37:49.772 --> 37:52.894
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

37:53.014 --> 37:55.605
Just throw it away.

37:57.550 --> 38:01.045
Just throw it away and understand

38:01.166 --> 38:06.129
that you are the eternal attention,

38:07.542 --> 38:12.072
that you are the eternal life,

38:12.653 --> 38:18.581
that [the] only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance,

38:19.367 --> 38:23.601
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

38:23.721 --> 38:28.105
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

38:29.201 --> 38:32.672
Just drop it! It’s all myth!

38:33.553 --> 38:38.956
You’ll be amazed how your attention will rise

38:40.079 --> 38:44.138
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

38:44.289 --> 38:47.718
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

38:47.838 --> 38:52.278
will drop out, and you will just smile at it.

38:52.451 --> 38:57.129
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself fully

38:57.249 --> 38:59.464
because your attention

38:59.584 --> 39:04.925
will be completely drenched into the bliss of Self.

39:07.566 --> 39:12.310
I am saying you will, I say you are

39:13.541 --> 39:18.079
already drenched into that bliss.

39:19.222 --> 39:21.262
Keep it up.

39:21.761 --> 39:25.261
Now, how to do it?

39:27.086 --> 39:33.857
Actually, in every day-to-day life, how to kill the memory of the past?

39:37.591 --> 39:42.978
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories.

39:44.788 --> 39:49.080
You must remember when you got your first Realisation

39:51.025 --> 39:52.789
– always think of it.

39:52.909 --> 39:56.284
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

39:56.404 --> 40:00.852
you [should] try to think how you got your Realisation.

40:01.686 --> 40:06.966
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating,

40:07.086 --> 40:15.266
you just try to remember how Realisation has come to you.

40:17.169 --> 40:22.113
When you feel aggressive about something or angry [about] something,

40:22.233 --> 40:28.249
just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering.

40:30.599 --> 40:36.933
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of dissolving yourself.

40:37.671 --> 40:41.254
So the new memories must be built up.

40:41.413 --> 40:45.264
If you start building up new memories,

40:45.384 --> 40:48.819
then you will start collecting moments

40:48.939 --> 40:58.541
to establish other moments which have such memories.

40:59.938 --> 41:03.661
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

41:03.781 --> 41:07.702
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

41:08.376 --> 41:11.768
Now the problem would be when you will be raising the Kundalini of others,

41:11.889 --> 41:15.029
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there won’t be any thought –

41:15.150 --> 41:18.607
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

41:18.727 --> 41:26.020
But [at] that time you can record the joy of raising the Kundalini.

41:26.253 --> 41:33.037
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini of others,

41:36.561 --> 41:42.381
you will feel [that] a new wealth

41:42.501 --> 41:47.807
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

41:47.927 --> 41:54.153
And all those moments which were giving you confusion

41:54.273 --> 42:00.047
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop out

42:00.167 --> 42:03.051
and pure joy will remain.

42:03.172 --> 42:09.550
Because now most of the experiences you have had are more of joy.

42:10.811 --> 42:13.370
Joy has no thoughts.

42:13.490 --> 42:18.996
It’s just an experience, a pratyaksha.

42:21.282 --> 42:24.455
That’s why I said you keep your eyes open.

42:27.767 --> 42:31.162
I hope you will understand what I mean by that.

42:32.893 --> 42:34.710
May God bless you all.

42:40.835 --> 42:42.782
I think let us meditate today.

42:42.902 --> 42:47.231
Maybe this meditation will help us. Please close your eyes.

42:47.967 --> 42:50.087
(break in recording)

42:56.105 --> 42:58.742
..all of you, these things, put it on the fire.

42:58.862 --> 43:07.262
Douglas [Fry], take these two, these things, and take them on the fire.

43:07.382 --> 43:12.942
(break in recording)

43:13.062 --> 43:18.502
…without paying attention here or there or without worrying.

43:19.248 --> 43:24.183
Worry and all these things are vikshepas, are all confusions, comes from confusion.

43:24.303 --> 43:30.183
You have known about me that I can sit for nine hours in one pose.

43:30.303 --> 43:33.703
I mean I have done that but I can do even more.

43:33.823 --> 43:42.081
So one has to develop a baithak, is a sitting posture, for some time.

43:42.202 --> 43:45.374
You must settle down in some position. Alright?

43:45.494 --> 43:50.977
Should try to do that, and whatever is required for that is to be done

43:51.097 --> 43:53.965
because that’s the only way you can do it.

43:54.085 --> 43:58.436
If you are walking, still your attention will be moving about.

43:58.557 --> 44:03.013
Anyway, if there’s a movement then the time, space comes into play.

44:03.133 --> 44:09.108
But if you can settle down, if you can have a place where you can sit down.

44:09.338 --> 44:11.070
And that’s why the photograph helps.

44:11.191 --> 44:14.259
If you can see the photograph continuously,

44:14.874 --> 44:18.230
with a relaxed eyes, not all the time staring but relaxed eyes.

44:18.414 --> 44:21.683
You can close your eyes with respect [then] again you can open your eyes.

44:21.803 --> 44:24.655
This settling down of the position

44:24.775 --> 44:27.417
– you will be surprised how your attention will

44:27.537 --> 44:30.444
gradually rise, you will feel it.

44:32.293 --> 44:35.481
Just now you are all in thoughtless awareness so go into meditation.

44:35.601 --> 44:39.161
No, if you cannot sit you can take a seat, you see, down below.

44:39.282 --> 44:44.124
But as I said it, clothes should be a little lighter.

44:44.245 --> 44:48.225
Alright, put your hands towards me. You have to sit for about now, five minutes.

44:48.345 --> 44:50.248
I will not make you [sit] much.

44:50.368 --> 44:54.867
But I hope you will develop it next time your sitting.

46:37.029 --> 46:39.893
Right hand on the heart I think will help. Right hand on the heart.

46:40.013 --> 46:44.349
Now do it with your heart. Do – it – with – your – heart.

46:46.614 --> 46:48.924
Right hand on the heart.

47:03.090 --> 47:07.645
Think within that, “I am the Eternal Life, I am the Spirit”

47:18.974 --> 47:27.095
Hold your breath.

47:27.215 --> 47:32.695
Leave it.

47:40.284 --> 47:46.486
This time when you hold your breath you should know that I am the Mother of the Universe

47:46.606 --> 47:51.804
and the most powerful personality.

47:53.482 --> 47:57.317
And I am your Mother and you are all protected.

47:57.437 --> 47:59.449
Hold your breath.

48:05.838 --> 48:08.272
Haa! Leave it.

48:25.133 --> 48:27.640
Good.

48:27.760 --> 48:30.157
You are still children I must say.

48:30.756 --> 48:32.517
Don’t you know that I’m very powerful?

48:32.747 --> 48:34.116
Have I to tell you?

48:35.227 --> 48:37.032
Even the small children know that.

48:49.920 --> 48:50.920
Alright?

49:01.512 --> 49:02.856
Relax.

49:08.158 --> 49:09.725
Let’s have some music and something.

49:09.845 --> 49:13.639
Now, any questions anywhere?

49:17.081 --> 49:21.067
Yogi: I have a question. Could you explain the difference between joy and happiness?

49:21.187 --> 49:22.890
Shri Mataji: Oh!

49:23.010 --> 49:24.612
Very simple you know.

49:24.732 --> 49:30.110
Joy doesn’t have a double thing like happiness and unhappiness.

49:30.230 --> 49:31.994
Joy is singular, absolute.

49:32.114 --> 49:35.410
It’s absolute. It is thoughtless.

49:35.530 --> 49:37.683
It’s fulfilment.

49:37.803 --> 49:41.996
Happiness is always shadowed by unhappiness,

49:42.116 --> 49:47.613
is the double coined stuff, double faces of a coin.

49:47.733 --> 49:51.863
Happiness will be followed by unhappiness, unhappiness by happiness.

49:51.983 --> 49:54.663
It’s a relative terminology.

49:54.783 --> 49:58.825
But joy is absolute, absolute.

49:58.962 --> 50:01.650
It’s beyond thought. It’s bliss.

50:01.872 --> 50:04.593
Yogi: It’s more like contentment.

50:04.713 --> 50:08.479
Shri Mataji: Contentment can be relative still.

50:08.599 --> 50:12.354
But it’s all that in one.

50:12.474 --> 50:18.074
Joy is where you do not ask anything anymore, you’re just there.

50:19.368 --> 50:23.899
It just emits then. Just emits.

50:25.748 --> 50:29.945
You don’t want anything, it just goes overflowing.

50:31.151 --> 50:33.427
It has nothing to do with your rationality,

50:33.547 --> 50:36.263
cannot be perceived through your rationality.

50:36.383 --> 50:38.534
It’s beyond, you just feel it.

50:38.654 --> 50:40.579
Hmm. Jeremy?

50:40.699 --> 50:42.231
Jeremy: Why do we dream?

50:42.778 --> 50:44.246
What makes us dream?

50:44.366 --> 50:46.546
Shri Mataji: Dreams? Now dreams are you see:

50:46.721 --> 50:51.744
there are three stages of our consciousness in the normal way – not the fourth one

50:51.865 --> 50:55.997
that, now, you are in the fourth one – but normally there are three stages.

50:58.433 --> 51:01.773
And the third stage is called as shushupti,

51:01.893 --> 51:07.230
where you are in a stage where you are deep asleep.

51:07.351 --> 51:11.066
That time you come in contact with the unconscious.

51:11.186 --> 51:14.213
Unconscious actually enters your attention,

51:14.333 --> 51:18.684
and you start getting the information from that.

51:18.804 --> 51:24.597
But a person who is not yet realised

51:24.717 --> 51:27.334
is not yet quite awake in that state, in the sense that,

51:27.455 --> 51:29.755
whatever he records gets again clouded

51:29.876 --> 51:32.178
when he is coming back through those stages of…

51:32.320 --> 51:38.020
he comes through subconscious areas, lots of areas we can say,

51:38.141 --> 51:41.584
that he comes out of all the subconscious areas

51:41.704 --> 51:45.174
that he has got within him, and the supraconscious areas within him,

51:45.294 --> 51:46.934
and then he comes to conscious mind.

51:47.054 --> 51:50.204
So lots of things cloud it, like covered it,

51:50.325 --> 51:53.094
so the interpretation or even the memory of

51:53.214 --> 51:55.588
the dream could be quite confused.

51:55.750 --> 52:00.812
But after Realisation you touch even deeper because you enter into unconscious.

52:00.933 --> 52:03.265
Not that The unconscious has to do anything,

52:03.386 --> 52:05.053
but you enter into the unconscious.

52:05.173 --> 52:10.053
Your attention goes into the attention and it records what it sees.

52:10.173 --> 52:15.379
The more you become Realised, the dream state will go away.

52:15.499 --> 52:20.374
For example I never dream. I mean actually I am in dream.

52:20.494 --> 52:23.564
I never dream in the sense that when I am so-called dreaming,

52:23.684 --> 52:25.779
I am actually there working it out.

52:25.899 --> 52:29.037
And I can verify it with others that I was that time with you.

52:29.157 --> 52:30.608
He says, “Yes, this happened.”

52:30.728 --> 52:32.928
So, you see, it’s a different state of mine.

52:33.048 --> 52:37.584
But actually this happens, you never have a dream, you are always in reality.

52:37.704 --> 52:39.940
But that’s a different thing. But at least

52:40.061 --> 52:43.731
whatever you record in that from the unconscious,

52:43.851 --> 52:45.711
at least should be your own.

52:45.831 --> 52:49.051
But mostly the dreams of the people are clouded,

52:49.171 --> 52:52.177
so the dream doesn’t have much meaning.

52:52.682 --> 52:57.292
But with Sahaja Yoga you are enlightened so much that,

52:57.412 --> 53:03.789
in your dreams also, you see what unconscious has to say actually.

53:03.910 --> 53:06.324
Which is not confused, which is not clouded,

53:06.444 --> 53:09.725
which is absolutely with that you are awakened.

53:09.910 --> 53:13.860
I mean, for example, you might see me, many a times, in dreams.

53:13.980 --> 53:16.065
And suggestions you will get from me.

53:16.186 --> 53:19.469
I mean, I work through dreams only, through the unconscious.

53:19.589 --> 53:22.664
But some people always will say, “Oh, I have seen you somewhere.

53:22.784 --> 53:25.337
I have seen you many a times. I don’t know where I have seen.

53:25.458 --> 53:27.184
Were you in New York?” I said, “No.”

53:27.304 --> 53:32.593
“Then where did I see you?” They saw me in their sleep, you see.

53:32.714 --> 53:37.452
But they cannot connect that it was in the sleep [that] they had seen me.

53:37.572 --> 53:41.374
They are not Realised people but they have seen me.

53:46.014 --> 53:48.588
Yogini: Can you give people Realisation in their sleep?

53:48.708 --> 53:52.067
Shri Mataji: No. No. I cannot.

53:52.188 --> 53:54.831
I do not even want to give Realisation to people

53:54.952 --> 53:59.198
when they are not facing me, either my photograph or Sahaja Yogis.

53:59.333 --> 54:04.173
That should not be. Because recognition is the only point in Sahaja Yoga.

54:04.911 --> 54:10.084
Modern Sahaja Yoga is only going to work out if you recognise me!

54:10.204 --> 54:13.963
If you do not recognise me, it’s not going to work out.

54:14.083 --> 54:16.305
This is the only way.

54:16.425 --> 54:18.981
This is the only key?

54:19.116 --> 54:21.116
Because so far you have never recognised.

54:21.237 --> 54:25.392
Only on recognition all your past things will be forgiven, everything will be done.

54:25.512 --> 54:29.778
But if you refuse to recognise me or you go slow with it, your progress will be slow.

54:29.898 --> 54:31.693
Which I have told you frankly.

54:31.814 --> 54:36.889
Though it’s rather embarrassing job, but I have to tell you. This is a fact.

54:37.509 --> 54:39.424
So in dream you cannot give Realisation.

54:39.544 --> 54:43.240
But in dream you might see the situation in which will be giving,

54:43.361 --> 54:46.644
how you should give. Your solutions will be suggested to you,

54:46.764 --> 54:49.951
how to approach a particular person.

54:50.252 --> 54:52.940
But you cannot give Realisation to anyone.

54:53.060 --> 54:58.380
They have to know that they have got Realisation through Mataji Nirmala Devi.

54:59.888 --> 55:02.982
As it is, when you give them Realisation, they have no value [for it].

55:03.102 --> 55:07.542
If they don’t know me, they will have no value.

55:15.568 --> 55:19.991
But I would still suggest that one should not go on analysing the dreams too much.

55:20.111 --> 55:21.871
Again the same problem will start.

55:21.991 --> 55:24.344
Because I know Jung and all these people did that.

55:24.464 --> 55:28.025
But that was alright at that stage because they were not Realised people,

55:28.146 --> 55:32.317
or they were Realised of a very confused manner,

55:32.438 --> 55:34.831
in the sense that they were not sure of themselves.

55:34.951 --> 55:37.845
But you people do not go on bothering about dreams so much.

55:37.966 --> 55:43.682
The dreams are coming to you to give you a solution of a problem.

55:45.340 --> 55:47.209
The unconscious is helping you in dreams.

55:47.329 --> 55:53.594
For example, when I go to India most of them dream that Mother is coming.

55:54.785 --> 55:58.836
I mean it acts like television!

56:05.301 --> 56:08.460
Sahaja Yogi: I dreamt of you after the first time I came here.

56:11.705 --> 56:14.878
Shri Mataji: After you came here? Not before?

56:14.998 --> 56:18.854
But there are people who have come to me because they dreamt about me also.

56:18.974 --> 56:23.394
Now that’s a good thing. To dream about me means you’ve gone very deep.

56:23.514 --> 56:25.580
The verification comes in.

56:25.700 --> 56:33.218
Sahaja Yogi: When I was here, you put your hand over this eye, when I dreamt about it

56:33.516 --> 56:37.052
it was as though something was pulled out of it, like a crystal.

56:38.407 --> 56:43.299
And it fell on the floor and it sort of grew legs and ran away.

56:43.419 --> 56:45.964
(laughter).

56:51.210 --> 56:55.050
I used to suffer from headaches and since that time I haven’t.

56:56.361 --> 57:01.509
Shri Mataji: You see! That’s true. That’s true.

57:01.630 --> 57:04.776
I mean, actually it is done like that.

57:04.896 --> 57:07.703
I’ll tell you an example, a very concrete example of this.

57:07.824 --> 57:12.315
One man who used to come to Sahaja Yoga and was very deep into it.

57:12.688 --> 57:19.852
You see some of the Rajneesh’s disciples wanted to sort of harm him.

57:19.972 --> 57:23.646
So they called him and they said, “We’ll offer you a paan (leaf)”

57:23.767 --> 57:25.492
– you see, that we eat and all that.

57:25.613 --> 57:28.735
And they really mesmerised him and gave him a paan.

57:28.856 --> 57:30.533
He ate the paan and all that.

57:30.653 --> 57:34.174
That was after the programme, about 10.30 he ate the paan,

57:34.295 --> 57:36.823
and he went into his subconscious areas.

57:36.943 --> 57:39.346
But he was coming to consciousness little bit,

57:39.467 --> 57:42.502
and then they took him in the taxi and beat him.

57:42.622 --> 57:44.222
But they could not beat!

57:44.342 --> 57:48.427
He could see that they used to come and beat him and their hands were held by somebody.

57:48.548 --> 57:51.228
Could not feel the beating on him at all.

57:51.349 --> 57:53.925
And he used to come to consciousness, again unconscious,

57:54.046 --> 57:55.977
and then he became absolutely conscious.

57:56.101 --> 57:59.233
He saw them beating him and they were getting the pain

57:59.354 --> 58:02.332
as if beaten but he was never beaten up.

58:02.452 --> 58:06.340
And then they left him in one place

58:06.461 --> 58:10.988
and then they took out his gold chain, and he had one ring

58:11.109 --> 58:13.763
of a real ruby on his fingers, they took out all that,

58:13.883 --> 58:16.158
and they left him in one place somewhere.

58:16.279 --> 58:21.335
And he walked all the way from there to his house.

58:21.456 --> 58:24.288
So, I saw all this happening to him

58:24.409 --> 58:28.554
and that I was trying to slap, bang these people and all that.

58:28.674 --> 58:30.175
I saw all that, I was doing it.

58:30.296 --> 58:34.259
So, early in the morning I got up, about six o’clock and I telephoned to his house and

58:34.380 --> 58:37.431
I said that how is he now? His wife said, “He came very late.

58:37.552 --> 58:40.867
I mean he came really in the morning time about five o’clock.

58:40.987 --> 58:43.212
And now he’s sleeping.” I said, “Let him sleep.

58:43.332 --> 58:45.402
He has had a very bad time last night

58:45.522 --> 58:47.750
and he suffered a lot and these Rajneesh people

58:47.871 --> 58:49.482
have troubled him a lot,” I told her.

58:49.603 --> 58:52.326
She was quite surprised, she didn’t know all these things!

58:52.447 --> 58:56.027
When he got up she asked, “Where did you go?” And he told all the story about it.

58:56.148 --> 58:59.414
Then he telephoned to me and he said, “Mother, you were there to save me!”

58:59.535 --> 59:02.319
I said, “Alright.” I told him, but normally I don’t tell you.

59:02.439 --> 59:04.634
But that day I just wanted to find out.

59:04.754 --> 59:10.402
Then he said that, “I’ve lost my ring that was given to me by my father

59:10.523 --> 59:13.380
and I really feel sad about it.”

59:14.737 --> 59:17.115
So I said, “Alright you will find it.

59:17.235 --> 59:19.840
Both the things you are going to get it.”

59:19.960 --> 59:25.518
And when he was getting down from the staircase

59:25.638 --> 59:29.564
he found a red kind of a bundle lying there.

59:29.684 --> 59:32.482
And his wife said, “What is this red bundle lying here for?”

59:32.602 --> 59:37.744
So he picked it up. Inside was the ring and inside was his chain.

59:37.864 --> 59:39.657
Then he immediately telephoned to me,

59:39.778 --> 59:42.466
“Mother I have found both the things, how did you manage?”

59:42.586 --> 59:43.657
You see it can be done.

59:43.777 --> 59:47.790
So all that was done for them because you see one can work it out.

59:47.910 --> 59:50.710
It can happen like that. But,

59:52.221 --> 59:56.863
you must know that everything is done through the power of Brahma,

59:56.984 --> 59:59.005
that’s the glow of Adi Shakti.

59:59.125 --> 01:00:03.200
It’s all done through that. The rest is all myth.

01:00:05.316 --> 01:00:09.344
If you are not frightened of the myth, and if you do not recognise the myth,

01:00:09.464 --> 01:00:13.450
you are above it! But you still recognise it.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:15.986
This is the problem.

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:22.034
Sahaja Yogi: If you are a scientist say,

01:00:22.155 --> 01:00:25.035
are you saying that you shouldn’t continue scientific work?

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.516
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. If you are a scientist

01:00:29.636 --> 01:00:32.713
then, after Realisation, what you should do is to bring

01:00:32.834 --> 01:00:35.067
science and Realisation together.

01:00:35.187 --> 01:00:38.038
You can explain science and Realisation together.

01:00:38.158 --> 01:00:40.969
You have to explain Realisation through scientific method.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:45.160
This should be your effort, a new direction, because you have found out that you are Realised,

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.664
you have found out that there is All-pervading Power, now, if you can put it

01:00:48.785 --> 01:00:51.600
in the scientific language you can talk to them.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.800
So that knowledge is not wasted.

01:00:56.669 --> 01:01:01.195
Supposing you are a geologist, you can explain many things of geology

01:01:01.315 --> 01:01:06.008
which you have not explained so far, through Realisation.

01:01:06.136 --> 01:01:09.415
So you give actually the science it’s fulfilment itself!

01:01:09.567 --> 01:01:13.692
There are so many questions they cannot answer.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:28.430
Every thing, politics, everything – why it has failed, what has happened,

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:34.706
what is the reason – everything can be explained through science of Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:38.122
Everything! why it works out, why it doesn’t work out,

01:01:38.242 --> 01:01:40.182
what’s the thing, what is the failure is

01:01:40.302 --> 01:01:43.222
– everything can be explained.

01:01:43.342 --> 01:01:46.369
Human behaviour, everything.

01:01:49.266 --> 01:01:55.349
So use your knowledge to enlighten the knowledge

01:01:55.469 --> 01:01:58.358
which is covered with ignorance.

01:02:08.861 --> 01:02:14.734
For example, see now, you have developed films, cinemas, this, that.

01:02:14.855 --> 01:02:16.926
Use it for Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:17.628 --> 01:02:22.631
How can you use it for Sahaja Yoga you should try to find out ways and methods.

01:02:27.428 --> 01:02:30.605
Supposing you are a dramatist: use that drama.

01:02:30.725 --> 01:02:33.810
Make a drama on Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:48.215 --> 01:02:51.789
Put your mind to that and you can do it.

01:02:51.956 --> 01:02:55.475
For example, supposing somebody is doing a course in journalism,

01:02:55.595 --> 01:03:00.177
then he should use his journalism for to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:04.819 --> 01:03:10.127
You should try to find out in geology also, or in any subject whatsoever:

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:16.008
the light of Sahaja Yoga which is being missed so far by the scientists,

01:03:16.221 --> 01:03:18.699
by the geologists, by the psychologists, by everyone,

01:03:18.819 --> 01:03:22.485
because it’s all a science which is secluded, which is

01:03:22.605 --> 01:03:27.590
in darkness, which has no connection with the whole.

01:03:33.437 --> 01:03:36.399
Now you see your fire is here alright?

01:03:36.519 --> 01:03:41.382
Now, when I put my hand there, what happens is this fire is enlightened.

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:48.943
This power sucks in from you, or any one of you who are Realised-souls,

01:03:49.063 --> 01:03:55.093
whatever is within you which can be burnt away by fire,

01:03:58.077 --> 01:04:00.214
and it burns it off.

01:04:02.497 --> 01:04:10.617
This fire you have analysed in ignorance but now you are enlightened.

01:04:10.868 --> 01:04:12.683
I gave realisation in India

01:04:12.804 --> 01:04:15.766
to some scientists who were working on the agriculture.

01:04:15.887 --> 01:04:19.816
They started using vibrations for agriculture

01:04:22.295 --> 01:04:27.864
and they were surprised that they could produce ten times more yield.

01:04:27.984 --> 01:04:30.204
I mean, you can see the difference between

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.530
the types of things that are being produced

01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:35.677
and they are doing tremendous work on that.

01:04:35.798 --> 01:04:40.474
They’ll be publishing papers and things and they are doing that.

01:04:42.127 --> 01:04:50.705
You can see also how vibrations work on say a nucleus of an atom.

01:04:52.654 --> 01:04:54.868
They will be acted through mesotrons

01:04:55.011 --> 01:04:58.575
If you see that, mesotrons will immediately react to it because

01:04:58.696 --> 01:05:01.667
they are arbitrary and you will be amazed you can handle them

01:05:01.787 --> 01:05:04.492
and manoeuvre them through your vibrations,

01:05:04.612 --> 01:05:08.024
if you see them under microscope.

01:05:08.144 --> 01:05:10.197
If you want to go into it you can go into it,

01:05:10.318 --> 01:05:13.610
because first of all you have to convince these horrible people

01:05:13.731 --> 01:05:18.469
what else could be, and give up everything else

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:23.515
and just accept it be within it.

01:05:26.633 --> 01:05:30.500
We are curing people without any science with us.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.804
We are curing mad people without any science.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.747
After all, everything is for the betterment of human beings.

01:05:35.867 --> 01:05:40.399
We are improving food problem.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.487
We are improving even material problem,

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:46.750
everybody has got betterment,

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:50.270
I mean, Lakshmi tattwa is improved in them.

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:53.493
All these things can be done.

01:05:55.262 --> 01:05:58.180
And scientists can show that science taken to extreme

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:03.928
can take [us] to destruction, which is not related to the whole.

01:06:04.048 --> 01:06:08.295
If you move in one direction, a linear movement,

01:06:08.415 --> 01:06:11.323
it just coils back and comes back to you.

01:06:11.443 --> 01:06:15.913
But if you are related to the whole then you know how to balance it,

01:06:16.034 --> 01:06:19.564
otherwise the nose starts growing or the ears start [growing] – it’s malignant.

01:06:19.699 --> 01:06:23.650
The growth of science, the modern science, is malignant.

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:29.511
Even on Earth, if part of Earth starts growing, for example, on one side,

01:06:29.632 --> 01:06:34.370
the whole balance and equilibrium will be gone of the Earth, isn’t it!

01:06:34.598 --> 01:06:40.280
I mean if you see The Nature in its real completeness

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.864
then you will see there’s such a balance existing.

01:06:44.984 --> 01:06:50.714
Science just moves like a blind horse in one direction.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.823
What is the use? Then you go to atom and from atom

01:06:55.944 --> 01:07:00.267
you go to atomic energy and from there to the destruction part.

01:07:00.754 --> 01:07:04.355
But if you had kept to the truth and to the complete,

01:07:04.475 --> 01:07:06.944
then you would not have gone that far.

01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:10.996
Alright, it’s useful for us, use it.

01:07:12.948 --> 01:07:18.733
Analysis destroys you, destroys all our character, everything.

01:07:18.854 --> 01:07:23.268
If you start analysing you, yourself, you’ll be destroyed.

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:27.341
Take yourself as a whole.

01:07:29.047 --> 01:07:31.367
There are people I have known who analyse me also.

01:07:31.487 --> 01:07:34.336
Such silly fools I have seen.

01:07:35.932 --> 01:07:38.972
Haa, there are.

01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:50.452
It’s so fantastic, the way human beings go about

01:07:51.844 --> 01:07:54.484
with there small little brain!

01:07:58.673 --> 01:08:01.929
Anything they cannot explain in Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:08.428
When you have the higher science to discover, forget the lower sciences.

01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:12.721
I mean, when you were a frog,

01:08:13.229 --> 01:08:15.426
you were only worried about the well where you lived but

01:08:15.546 --> 01:08:18.742
now today you are a human being, you are worried about other things.

01:08:18.863 --> 01:08:23.120
Now, if you become a super-human being, you should be worried about higher sciences.

01:08:24.985 --> 01:08:30.679
Now what have you achieved through science we can achieve in a second through Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:39.728 --> 01:08:43.040
Your material welfare can be, in a second we can improve it.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.973
If you get your Realisation, materially you will be better off.

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:55.930
Most of the people they declare as coma and dead

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:58.846
or lunatic and gone cases…

01:08:58.967 --> 01:09:01.516
they have not been able to cure any lunatic whatsoever.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.997
Once he goes to the lunatic asylum he just comes [out] as a corpse.

01:09:05.117 --> 01:09:08.566
He never comes back as a sane person.

01:09:09.503 --> 01:09:11.393
What your science has achieved so far?

01:09:11.513 --> 01:09:13.607
And in which way?

01:09:13.727 --> 01:09:16.907
Take to anything: political problems, anything.

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:23.309
You try to have political, say democracy – you have created demonocracy.

01:09:24.087 --> 01:09:30.159
You wanted to have communism – it is nothing but killing everyone.

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:32.344
Everything is a topsy turvy.

01:09:32.464 --> 01:09:37.728
Hello! How are you?

01:09:37.848 --> 01:09:39.454
Come here you come here!

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:43.212
You’re daddy has come?

01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:44.037
Child: Yes.

01:09:44.158 --> 01:09:45.413
Shri Mataji: Where is he?

01:09:45.534 --> 01:09:46.340
Child: In there.

01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:51.188
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see, I see. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Good!

01:09:52.211 --> 01:09:53.991
Now any other question?

01:09:54.112 --> 01:09:56.305
Should we have some music?

01:10:02.181 --> 01:10:05.329
Yogi: Mother, what is the true meaning of your name ‘Shri Bhagawati’?

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:08.041
I have seen several different translations of the name

01:10:08.161 --> 01:10:09.273
Shri Mataji: You see,

01:10:09.394 --> 01:10:11.729
entirely different to each other.

01:10:14.304 --> 01:10:21.012
‘Bh’ ‘ga’: “Bhaga” means six things all together.

01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:25.196
They are the six attributes of God

01:10:25.576 --> 01:10:30.738
and Bhagawati is the power of God, that’s why She’s called that.

01:10:30.858 --> 01:10:33.912
Six basic attributes of God.

01:10:38.491 --> 01:10:52.237
First is innocence, second is creativity, third is…

01:11:18.486 --> 01:11:21.215
fatherliness, you can say, but

01:11:21.335 --> 01:11:25.798
is the one which nourishes.

01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:40.907
You see if you put the gardener and the Mother Earth together

01:11:41.027 --> 01:11:46.197
then what is the quality of them, is nourishment to grow,

01:11:46.318 --> 01:11:49.262
looking after, called as ‘palanhaar’.

01:11:50.477 --> 01:11:53.186
In English must be a word somewhere.

01:11:53.306 --> 01:11:56.314
The ‘Patron’?

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.280
But ‘patron’ doesn’t mean all that, isn’t it.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.268
Yogi: Husbandry?

01:12:03.388 --> 01:12:04.644
Shri Mataji: Husbandry?

01:12:04.764 --> 01:12:08.444
‘Husbandry’ is a funny word! (laughter)

01:12:12.967 --> 01:12:14.967
Something like that.

01:12:16.161 --> 01:12:17.281
‘Paternal’

01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:21.779
Shri Mataji: But it is also maternal, you see.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:23.186
Yogini: Guardian?

01:12:23.307 --> 01:12:25.649
Shri Mataji: Guardian is only in control.

01:12:25.769 --> 01:12:29.748
You see all these things put together is ‘palanhaar’.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:33.310
Yogi: Sustainer.

01:12:34.167 --> 01:12:36.183
Shri Mataji: Sustenance is also there.

01:12:36.303 --> 01:12:41.863
But the kindness, the control, the looking after, the weeding out.

01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:49.194
All the beauties of that and the enjoyment of seeing your creation.

01:12:51.392 --> 01:12:52.392
The growth.

01:12:52.763 --> 01:12:56.065
The One who makes our growth possible.

01:13:05.999 --> 01:13:08.079
Then He is Almighty.

01:13:09.319 --> 01:13:10.710
Almighty.

01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:15.696
Nobody is more powerful than Him. He’s the most powerful.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:29.074
And He encompasses everything.

01:13:33.225 --> 01:13:37.709
He’s All-pervading and He knows everything – Sarvarupa.

01:13:38.753 --> 01:13:42.517
He knows everything, omniscient.

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.785
This is ‘Bhaga’.

01:13:52.905 --> 01:13:58.883
And Bhagawati is the power of God.

01:14:00.908 --> 01:14:03.895
Without Bhagawati, God has no meaning.

01:14:04.715 --> 01:14:10.053
It’s like moon and moonlight, it’s like sun and sunlight.

01:14:10.892 --> 01:14:14.618
You cannot differentiate. They are just one and the same.

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:18.633
Yogi: Is Bhagawati Adi Shakti then?

01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:21.984
Shri Mataji: Adi Shakti is the same as Bhagawati.

01:14:22.877 --> 01:14:25.355
She’s called by many names.

01:14:25.475 --> 01:14:28.527
One of them is Nirmala also.
