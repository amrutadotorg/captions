1
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:42,909
Today we have gathered here to do
the Navaratri Puja.

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,373
There were nine times when the major
incarnations

3
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:56,513
of the Mother of this universe

4
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:05,146
were manifested. They were manifested
with a purpose.

5
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:15,335
That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas,
Her disciples, Her children.

6
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:18,537
This was

7
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:34,400
a binding love, She could not escape it.

8
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:40,172
Mother's love is binding, She cannot
escape it

9
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:46,498
and She has to manifest it, work it out

10
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:51,780
and give that protection to all
Her children.

11
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,139
This protection in the modern times
has taken another form.

12
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,546
In those days, the evil was trying

13
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:13,894
to harm, to destroy the people who were
righteous,

14
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:17,923
who were bhaktas, who were doing
good things,

15
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,801
who wanted to lead a very religious life.

16
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:29,495
So to save them, She incarnated.
To protect them, She incarnated.

17
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:34,247
But they knew what was good, they knew
what was wrong.

18
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:40,886
And they wanted to preserve their good
life, their precious life.

19
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:44,810
They didn't care for money, they didn't
care for power,

20
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:48,752
but just they wanted their life,

21
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:54,008
means they wanted to be alive to worship
the Goddess.

22
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,557
And when they were troubled or harmed
or destroyed

23
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:02,258
by these evil forces, She had to manifest.

24
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,478
But in modern times it's become
very complicated

25
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:10,225
as the modern times are complicated.

26
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:13,172
First of all,

27
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:19,887
in the mind, in the lifestyle,
in the society

28
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:26,457
of good human beings, righteous human
beings,

29
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,639
fear of the wrong has entered.

30
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,546
Like they are afraid say of their priests,
of their churches,

31
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:42,200
of their temples, of their mosques,
which are all false.

32
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,413
They are not afraid of God, they don't
believe in God.

33
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:51,749
They think they have created God and they
can manage God. So who is God?

34
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,888
The way they behave you can see clearly
that they do not recognize

35
00:03:56,089 --> 00:04:01,636
the existence of God, God Almighty who is
a wrathful God.

36
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:05,597
They are not at all worried as to what
will happen to them.

37
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:10,594
They don't even believe in the second life,
they don't believe in the resurrection.

38
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:17,411
They are very short-sighted, evil people
doing all kinds of evil things.

39
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:22,034
So somehow or other, as soon as you
are born,

40
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:25,761
you are born into some sort of a brand,

41
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:31,496
you are this, you are that, you are that,
you are that, as soon as you are born.

42
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:34,323
So the first brand comes onto this
modern man,

43
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:39,076
is of what religion to which he belongs.

44
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:45,334
He can't avoid it, he has to be jolly well
belonging to some religion.

45
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,080
You go anywhere, even in the passport -
nowadays they have stopped it -

46
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:53,941
otherwise they used to ask: "What is
your religion?"

47
00:04:55,071 --> 00:05:00,353
And in India if you said you had no
religion they would not give you a passport

48
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:04,134
because you are not yet qualified
evil person,

49
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:08,695
or you are not following qualified
evil people.

50
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:17,345
So that very simple gullible good people,
very righteous believers of God,

51
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:24,432
developed this kind of a fear which was put
into their heads by these false people.

52
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:27,292
That if you don't do like this, if you
don't pay money to us,

53
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,931
then God will be wrathful.

54
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:38,940
If you do not come to the confession,
then God will be angry with you,

55
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:43,272
if you do not tolerate our nonsense,
God will be angry with you.

56
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:50,058
All these things started going into
the brains of the people very easily.

57
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,863
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in drinking.

58
00:05:55,064 --> 00:06:00,076
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in marrying many women.

59
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:04,525
In some religion they believe that you
can have caste system.

60
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:12,981
All is anti-God, absolutely anti-God
activity perpetuated into the society

61
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:19,303
by these priests who are supposed to be
in charge of the religion.

62
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:26,427
So the first horrible conditioning we have
when we start Sahaja Yoga is this.

63
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:33,369
So to start something afresh they find it
very difficult.

64
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:42,496
So the first protection Mother had
to render is from this conditioning.

65
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,645
The second one is that of the country.

66
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:50,555
Either you belong to this country,
to that country, or to that country.

67
00:06:50,756 --> 00:07:00,964
And these days every country is competing
with each other in all kinds of

68
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:09,135
corruption, mafia, all kinds of things,
every country.

69
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:12,169
Suddenly you discover.

70
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:15,924
You have faith in one country, you find,
oh no, no, they were supporting

71
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:20,507
certain person secretly.

72
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,369
So whether they are democratic or anything,

73
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,461
there is a kind of a mafia working
everywhere under some name.

74
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:34,963
So the so-called laws also are only
for people who are simple, gullible,

75
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:39,610
pure citizens, and not for the people
who put those laws on them.

76
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:43,210
They take bribes, they take all kinds
of things, but still

77
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:48,376
they are supposed to be in charge of law,
doing all kinds of illegal things,

78
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:52,785
because they have made the law, so they
know how to be illegal.

79
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:58,475
So this is the second type of fear that is
in the minds of the modern time.

80
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:04,623
Then the third thing was the war.
Wars after wars came in,

81
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:10,319
so many people developed a kind of a fear
about war,

82
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,803
and as a reaction they developed a kind
of a stupid ego,

83
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,710
just they said, to protect themselves.

84
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:26,726
In protection, themselves, they have
built up a big ego

85
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:34,592
and they are now becoming very,
we should say, aggressive people.

86
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:46,526
So this kind of a wider range,
I should say, of fear,

87
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:52,905
it can be directed into any direction,
it can be directed towards anyone.

88
00:08:53,106 --> 00:09:01,091
Then comes - is the fear of race -
racialism.

89
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:06,824
Now I'm told that neo-nazism is taking
its own course

90
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:10,662
and is coming up like a little snake.

91
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:19,221
So this is another area which is very
dangerous now, working out.

92
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,892
Now in the minds of seekers -
in their seeking,

93
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,650
they have been to many gurus, they have
read all kinds of books

94
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:33,643
but they were seeking, you know. !!!!!!AAAAAAAAA
They can, they were seeking, yet...

95
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:37,193
drink any kind of water, develop all kinds
of diseases, what can you do?

96
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:42,538
You are seeking after all, you are thirsty.
It has to be excused.

97
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:45,506
And that's how they develop lots
of problems,

98
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:48,842
not only in their body but also
in their brain.

99
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:52,760
And now it's a very delicate thing.
If you tell somebody

100
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:56,128
that you have been to such and such guru,
he doesn't want to hear

101
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,671
because for him now the guru has become
the last word.

102
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:02,993
You cannot say anything against his guru.

103
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:06,742
Now when he starts suffering, then he may
accept,

104
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:09,931
but to take it out that guru is also
very delicate

105
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:14,328
because if you want to take out that guru,
then he might be hurt.

106
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,317
So it's a very delicate operation.

107
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:24,165
Then the modern society, the less said
the better.

108
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:28,781
The norms of modern society are given
to us by people

109
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:35,354
who were characterless like Freud, who had
no sense of morality,

110
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:39,837
or by drunkards, though they don't have
any statues of drunkards.

111
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:46,446
But most of them, if you see the abandonment
of our value system comes through drinking.

112
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,800
And the drinking was there but not
to this extent, I mean,

113
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:53,248
everybody was not a drunkard, these days
everybody can be a drunkard.

114
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:56,488
And there's no shame about it.
With that drinking

115
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:04,547
our value system started dropping down
and people have accepted now,

116
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:09,334
the normal thing is abandonment.
This is another way.

117
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:16,767
Formerly the parents used to support
the person if he would take to God,

118
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,673
if he would take to righteous life
or to something higher.

119
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:24,656
And if they saw these qualities in their
child they used to be happy,

120
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:29,533
but these days the other way round,
the parents don't like it.

121
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,573
As if the parents have lost everything
in themselves,

122
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:40,094
so they want to hold on to their children,
grandchildren and possess them.

123
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,326
And brainless creatures, because their
brain has been already washed out,

124
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:50,284
there's nothing in their brains. To fight
the parents also is a big problem.

125
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:54,185
So this kind of a fear is also there, that:
"My mother should not know,

126
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:58,252
my father should not know," this, that.

127
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:02,358
You can say from all sides

128
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,796
the fear is burning, like flames.

129
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:17,279
And we are now here, in Kali Yuga, we have
started Sahaja Yoga.

130
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:29,509
So the way we have to work out
our protection has to be mutual.

131
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:36,411
Mother of course is there to protect you
all the time,

132
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:39,800
Her powers are there to protect you.

133
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:44,492
But surprisingly in the modern times,

134
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:49,529
there's one condition which has to be
fulfilled.

135
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,684
Because in those days good were good

136
00:12:56,885 --> 00:13:01,905
and evil were evil, there was no mixing up.

137
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:05,538
So once they asked for Goddess, they
accepted Her,

138
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:09,126
She came in Her real form and She worked
it out.

139
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:14,247
But in modern times, you must know that
all these evil things

140
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:18,756
are also lingering in your head, little bit
here and there.

141
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:21,371
People are extremely superficial,

142
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:28,834
they are very much prone to the mass
attitude, fashions, things like that.

143
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:33,934
Sort of, their personality is not that
developed as that

144
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:38,634
of those bhaktas who knew they were right,
who knew they were righteous,

145
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,884
who knew whatever they were doing
was correct

146
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:48,150
and were standing on their legs firm.

147
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:57,048
So the modern Sahaja Yogi is very different
from the Sahaja Yogi of olden times.

148
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:03,794
Because in the olden times it was not easy
to get Realization.

149
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,896
One in a billion, or in a trillion.

150
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:14,990
And they had to work very hard, so as they
worked hard, very hard,

151
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:20,016
they got cleansed and built up themselves,
you see, and toiled.

152
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:24,951
Like any art piece which takes time,
is done with care,

153
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:28,216
is definitely thousand times better than
these modern artists

154
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,212
just putting two, three lines like this.

155
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:35,669
So the today's human being is like a modern
artist, you see.

156
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,426
You put one line and you say: "You must
see this into that person,

157
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:42,948
you must have an identity." I mean,
what identity people can have?

158
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,634
With one line, you say, find out
the identity.

159
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:54,787
So the Sahaja Yogis which are today here,
have to realize

160
00:14:54,988 --> 00:15:02,358
that all these things are surrounding us,
and these evil forces are also there.

161
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,807
There are some within us, some are without.

162
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:12,925
So it's a - looks to be very difficult
task, but it's not.

163
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:20,553
Because one condition if you can
understand,

164
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:25,359
is that you have to recognize Me.

165
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:30,777
I know I am Mahamaya, I'm really very
clever at it.

166
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:42,824
But I am truthful, I do not have crocodile
tears, I cannot have.

167
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:48,940
I am truthful, but still I am Mahamaya.

168
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:54,435
So to recognize Me what should we do?

169
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,749
If we recognize then you are protected.

170
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:09,872
And the cleansing is the simplest thing
in Sahaja Yoga is to be collective.

171
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:16,236
If you are not collective then know that
something wrong with you.

172
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:22,678
If you are collective then as if you are
taking your bath in the river Ganges.

173
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,700
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

174
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,015
you don't have to... just be collective.
If you are collective,

175
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:36,423
if you are enjoying the collective, then
you should know that you are clean.

176
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:42,508
No blemishes there, you are absolutely
all right.

177
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:49,527
Now the second part of is - this Mahamaya
business.

178
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:54,223
I had to be very close to you, I had to be
extremely close,

179
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:58,682
talk to you, to have a rapport, to tell you
everything about Yoga

180
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:04,702
to make you absolutely aware of yourself.
This had to be done,

181
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:08,516
and with all these complications within
your mind,

182
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:14,180
within your heart, within your body, I had
to work it out.

183
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:21,879
To come close in the real form would have
been very dangerous,

184
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,052
so One had to be a Mahamaya. But
despite that,

185
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:37,654
if you could recognize Me,
to understand Me,

186
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:44,123
that I am Divine personality,
it's an Incarnation -

187
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,749
that's all the Deities want. Then they'll
look after you in every way.

188
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,034
They'll give you all the powers, they'll
give you all the satisfaction,

189
00:17:56,235 --> 00:18:02,095
all the protection that you want. This is
the condition

190
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:06,708
which for a rational mind is very difficult
to understand,

191
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:12,761
that how can Adi Shakti be in one body?

192
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:18,176
How can the Infinite can become finite?

193
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,298
But human beings cannot do that.

194
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:30,021
Only human beings. God can do it. He is God
after all.

195
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:37,447
And if so, you have so many miracles,
you have so many photographs,

196
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:43,415
so many things to see, but this is what
one has to recognize.

197
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:48,776
Now I see people, when I talk to them

198
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:53,972
they start talking to Me a little
frivolously,

199
00:18:54,173 --> 00:19:00,621
not with that depth, not with that feeling
that I am Mahamaya.

200
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:05,604
Then some of them even answer Me. Some
of them, if I tell them something,

201
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:11,983
they are ready to give an answer,
explanation.

202
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,941
Of course this freedom I have given you
deliberately,

203
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:25,696
but must understand that you have
to talk to Me

204
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:32,560
in a way that is, you would talk
to Adi Shakti.

205
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:35,635
Very important.

206
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:47,919
Then how you behave is very important.
You should not be artificial,

207
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,213
you should not be superficial, but best is
to put your hand on your heart,

208
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:59,983
both the hands, and just try to feel it.

209
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:04,392
Your Mother is Adi Shakti.

210
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:11,406
She has created all this Universe, She
has created all this world,

211
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:19,815
She is for your protection. Even
Shri Krishna could not protect

212
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:26,086
Pandavas - they had to go in the forest,
they had to suffer.

213
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:29,827
But not Sahaja Yogis.

214
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:37,217
As soon as I come to know about your
problems, My attention can work out.

215
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:41,540
Shri Rama Himself had to go to jungles.

216
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:50,021
All this is given to you, this protection,
because you are seekers of truth,

217
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:58,486
and the truth is that I am the Adi Shakti
incarnated.

218
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,618
Once this truth becomes one with yourself

219
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,650
there is nothing to fear, because
all the Deities know this fact,

220
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:21,763
they know about this Incarnation very well.
They are all prepared for it,

221
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:30,885
and they'll do anything to substantiate
your belief.

222
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:36,911
In every way they are trying to give you
My photographs, in the sky, this, that,

223
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:41,756
I mean all sorts of things. God knows what
they are going to do today.

224
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,169
They are so anxious.

225
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:49,714
They are behind the stage, before
the stage, all sides of the stage,

226
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:55,544
listening to Me, feeling happy that I am
telling you the truth.

227
00:21:55,745 --> 00:22:02,965
But the way they recognize and the way
they act, they never disobey.

228
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,940
If you behave in the same manner

229
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:15,784
you are completely protected from all these
problems I have told you about.

230
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:23,761
Now I won't say you shouldn't hate anyone,
you shouldn't do.., nothing of the kind.

231
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:31,230
I wouldn't say you should not steal
something.

232
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:37,838
I wouldn't say that you make money, don't
make money out of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

233
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,049
I don't even say don't drink, don't smoke,
I never said so.

234
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,119
But automatically once you know whom
you are facing,

235
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,520
in whose protection you are, automatically
you will do that.

236
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:54,635
Automatically. You will have no fear.

237
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:59,576
Once you have recognized you will have
no fear from anyone.

238
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:07,385
And the more you show that recognition,
the more you realize it,

239
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:13,582
you get higher and higher. Not only
spiritually,

240
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:19,955
but every way - mentally, socially,
economically, politically.

241
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:26,152
It's very remarkable

242
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:33,929
that not only that you recognize Me
as a Mother who loves you very much,

243
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:41,786
but a Mother who is powerful to protect
you, She’s very powerful.

244
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:49,522
If you realize that, and if you feel that
within your heart,

245
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:54,892
supposing I correct you sometime, instead
of feeling sad you should see it

246
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:59,357
that "How fortunate I am that Adi Shakti
Herself is correcting me.

247
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:02,862
She is taking interest in me.

248
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:07,667
How fortunate I am to be born at this time,

249
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:14,127
to be with Her in Her great work, what
have I done?"

250
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:25,075
This recognition itself will fulfil all
the incarnations of Navaratri.

251
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:31,028
So today we are worshipping the Durga,
Kali,

252
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:35,752
all these great Goddesses, these Powers,
even Radha.

253
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:39,126
It was Radha who killed Kamsa not
Shri Krishna.

254
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:45,989
He had to ask Radha to come and kill him.
It's the Power that kills.

255
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:57,196
So if you realize

256
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:04,434
that your Mother is the Adi Shakti.

257
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:07,879
I know of so many people.

258
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:13,225
There's one gentleman who is working
in London airport.

259
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,087
Somebody tried to trouble him. He said:
"You see, be careful of?ah...

260
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,646
my Mother is very powerful, you don't
know."

261
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:24,985
Next day that man lost his job, lost
his business, lost this, lost this,

262
00:25:25,186 --> 00:25:30,355
and he came to him and said: "Now which
is your Mother, let me see Her?"

263
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:42,012
There was a farmer in, near Rahuri,

264
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:49,105
and in the night three men came to steal
some sugar cane.

265
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:57,724
And next day they came and they said:
"Which Goddess do you worship?"

266
00:25:57,925 --> 00:26:06,994
He said: "Why?". "There were three hefty
people watching your - guarding your field,

267
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:10,460
and we came just to... and we thought,
better take some of this sugar cane,

268
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:17,987
after all, it looks so nice, and they beat
us. Of course we never got hurt."

269
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:26,387
So just behind this recognition is
all the powers.

270
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:30,702
There's so many, so many stories I can
tell you,

271
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:34,928
how things have happened, how it has
worked out.

272
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:45,124
But if you are doubting, still halfway,
this, that, then things won't be all right.

273
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:50,229
You shouldn't worry about your reputation.

274
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:57,701
Just go with full speed into any direction,
knowing one thing -

275
00:26:57,902 --> 00:27:06,612
that you are My child, and that I am
Adi Shakti.

276
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,942
Everything that looks horrible will become
better.

277
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:16,486
We have seen it now in this France case,
and all that, what has happened.

278
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:21,668
Don't worry about anything, just know that

279
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:26,444
I am the Adi Shakti.

280
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:33,712
That all the powers of Gods and Goddesses
and all that are within Me,

281
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:38,113
and they are within Me, and they are all
looking after you.

282
00:27:38,314 --> 00:27:43,949
But if that recognition is not there, they
are not going to recognize you either.

283
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:55,699
So for today's Navaratri I have to tell you
that just try to keep in mind

284
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,562
that today you are worshipping
the Adi Shakti and not only Durga.

285
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,737
And you are worshipping Durga and all
these Goddesses to thank them.

286
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:11,784
Because if they had not saved you that time
you would have been so frightened,

287
00:28:11,985 --> 00:28:15,781
you would have become bad people and
you would not have been here.

288
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:19,960
That is why we are thankful to them
for saving us

289
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:26,687
and giving us this protection at that time
when we were very helpless.

290
00:28:31,856 --> 00:28:34,726
May God bless you all.
