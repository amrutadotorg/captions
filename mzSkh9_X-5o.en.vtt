00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.620
According to the calendar,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.540
this year there are ten days of Navaratri,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.580
not of nine.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.620
Nine are the days,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.340
in the night,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.620
when the Goddess had to fight the demons

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.860
and to save Her children from the effects of negativity.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.100
On one side,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.780
She was ocean of love and compassion,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.980
and on the other side,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.980
She was protecting them like a tigress.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.380
Because the times

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.940
were such that nobody could meditate,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.340
nobody could take the name of God,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.500
nobody could think even of Self-Realisation.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.060
But those who are sitting here today,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.420
you have been there also in those days,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.060
and you were all saved for today, for this day,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.180
so that you can achieve your Self Realisation.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.020
The form of the Goddess in those days

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.740
was not Maya Swarupi.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.620
She was in Her real form,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.620
and that created a great awe,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.060
even among the disciples.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.020
So the question of giving them

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.980
Self Realisation was not there.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.860
First of all, they were to be saved.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.340
So like nine months the mother has to keep the child

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.940
in her womb, for these nine months,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.780
or you can say nine yugas, nine times,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.220
you all have been saved properly,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:33.180
and on the tenth month you are given your birth.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.300
Also this birth is always after seven days of nine months.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.580
So we had to wait

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.700
for some time till it matures.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.820
Now the tenth Navaratri today

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.900
is to celebrate actually the Adi Shakti.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.940
So today we are really going to worship the Adi Shakti.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.260
On one side the Adi Shakti is Mahakali,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.300
on the other side, She is Mahasaraswati,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.980
in the centre She is Mahalakshmi,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.220
and also She is the Amba,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.460
the One Who is the Kundalini.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.820
But She is also beyond that.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.780
She's parashakti;

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.900
She's beyond all the powers.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.220
Because She is the generator of power.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.180
So, She has to be beyond all that.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.100
So today when we are worshipping Her,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.300
we have to worship Her in all these forms.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.780
So you understand that the tenth day

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.100
that we are having Navaratri for the first time

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.740
in the calendar is because

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.747
today is the day when we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:57.908
Now when they say there is only one God,

00:03:57.988 --> 00:03:59.577
all right there is one God.

00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:02.017
But one God has got a head,

00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:04.177
He's got His liver,

00:04:04.257 --> 00:04:06.337
He's got His stomach,

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:08.167
He's got His nose.

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.807
He's got everything.

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:12.767
Just like as human beings are.

00:04:12.847 --> 00:04:14.288
Because they say so,

00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:17.367
that God made human beings in their own image.

00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:20.166
So then He has different parts in the bodies,

00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:22.727
and He has to run those different parts.

00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:26.249
And for these different parts, He has to have Deities,

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:28.767
and these Deities are to be understood.

00:04:28.847 --> 00:04:33.088
And unless und until you understand
and worship those Deities,

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:36.488
you cannot awaken those Deities within yourself.

00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:41.047
But they all are part and parcel of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:46.133
Are completely under the control of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:46.213 --> 00:04:51.253
Yesterday you heard about the powers of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.360
It's like

00:04:55.846 --> 00:05:03.247
a tortoise takes his whole body inside his shell,

00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:09.207
in the same way I have withdrawn
all these powers within Myself.

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:15.326
I mean, you cannot discover them easily.

00:05:15.406 --> 00:05:17.886
You cannot find them out easily.

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:20.533
Except for these modern cameras,

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:24.000
which are trying to cheat us.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.382
They are the ones who are giving My forms and things to you.

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:34.902
Because there is light

00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:39.262
in these vibrations,

00:05:39.342 --> 00:05:42.222
and when these vibrations are emitted,

00:05:42.302 --> 00:05:47.342
you start seeing them in these cameras,

00:05:47.422 --> 00:05:49.862
even if they may not be very sensitive,

00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:52.862
but somehow people catch it.

00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:57.582
There have been so many miraculous photographs, as you know.

00:05:57.662 --> 00:06:00.382
One photograph you must have seen

00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:03.353
where Shri Ganesha Himself is standing behind Me.

00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:07.337
Now you don't see anyone standing just now here.

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:12.182
But you don't know what's happening.

00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:16.542
And this is what one has to understand,

00:06:16.622 --> 00:06:23.782
That we have entered into a new realm of God's magic.

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:28.227
And His magic works, in so many ways.

00:06:28.307 --> 00:06:32.626
Now the description yesterday as you read of the Goddess,

00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:35.346
that Her hands were throwing

00:06:35.426 --> 00:06:40.946
all the arrows with such a speed that
as if one felt that She was dancing.

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:46.826
Is a fact, no doubt,
but you don't see that.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:52.866
You cannot see that every hair of Mine is like an arrow.

00:06:54.586 --> 00:06:58.146
And it works so tremendously.

00:06:58.226 --> 00:07:05.506
But to you I'm just sitting here quietly,
just like you as you are sitting.

00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:07.906
But it's not so.

00:07:07.986 --> 00:07:10.866
It's something much more.

00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:15.906
Now when they show a lion or a tiger,

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:18.866
as My vahana,

00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:22.346
then you have to understand that they show,

00:07:22.426 --> 00:07:24.026
actually they are.

00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:25.825
Actually they are.

00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:28.946
It's not that they are symbolically, actually they are.

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:32.066
So the dignity of a tiger,

00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:34.946
I have told you many a times how dignified it is.

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:39.386
Because I sit on him, he's so dignified.

00:07:39.466 --> 00:07:43.439
If he has to eat the meat, he'll kill one cow or anything,

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:46.346
eat the meat, leave it for others.

00:07:46.426 --> 00:07:48.706
It's so dignified.

00:07:48.786 --> 00:07:51.426
And once a month he eats.

00:07:52.546 --> 00:07:58.386
So even to get a vahana of this kind,

00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:02.426
this was to be evolved from amoeba stage to this stage.

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:06.466
Otherwise he would not have been here.

00:08:08.506 --> 00:08:11.266
In the same way you are evolved,

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:15.306
and in you are these, all these vahanas also there.

00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:18.266
And they work out

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:22.346
very quickly all that you want.

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:25.239
You desire something;

00:08:25.946 --> 00:08:29.946
you'll be surprised immediately you'll find it works out.

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:34.226
You ask for something, immediately it works out.

00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:40.986
But there should be a complete dedication in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:42.827
When I say Sahaj Yog,

00:08:42.907 --> 00:08:49.426
you know that is the yoga of your attention with My Feet.

00:08:49.506 --> 00:08:51.502
That's what it is.

00:08:52.262 --> 00:08:58.942
So today we are talking about Shakti,
about the Power of the Goddess,

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:03.462
which are much more to be discovered

00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:06.862
and too intricate,

00:09:06.942 --> 00:09:11.234
very well balanced and extremely efficient.

00:09:11.314 --> 00:09:15.554
So, all the demons were killed,

00:09:15.634 --> 00:09:19.394
they are again back in their own seats.

00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:23.994
The worst thing is they have entered
into the heads of the seekers,

00:09:24.074 --> 00:09:27.726
because they have come as gurus now.

00:09:29.314 --> 00:09:33.692
They've come as Catholic Church,
as Protestant Church,

00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:37.372
as all kinds of temples

00:09:37.914 --> 00:09:41.674
and all kinds of fundamentalist and all that.

00:09:42.254 --> 00:09:47.114
All they look like rakshasas also,
if you look at them.

00:09:48.674 --> 00:09:52.594
And when they influence you, they go into your heads.

00:09:52.674 --> 00:09:56.666
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,
even those heads are cleansed

00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:59.361
and you are all right, out of it.

00:09:59.441 --> 00:10:05.960
So, My idea was that
today is not only the worship of the Khumba,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.560
where the Kundalini resides,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.519
but the Khumba becomes like a flower pot.

00:10:17.966 --> 00:10:21.206
It's like that, that has happened

00:10:21.772 --> 00:10:25.373
and then it can also, as somebody said that,

00:10:25.453 --> 00:10:31.533
"Mother these flower pots also can become table lamps."

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.160
I said, "See, now, you've said it!"

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.379
So the Khumba becoming flowers, and flowers becoming light,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.800
and the lights with fragrance!

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.280
I hope you'll understand My vision

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.240
and you'll stand by Me,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.200
you'll come up to that.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.553
I depend on you entirely for My vision.

00:10:56.633 --> 00:11:00.059
We have to change this whole world into a beautiful place.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:04.485
Now for that not much sacrifice is needed.

00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:07.753
You're already blessed, you don't have to do much,

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:14.720
only thing is keep your attention on the source of Power.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.075
May God bless you.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.240
Ah? Thank you.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.546
Mathias says, "We promise." You all say that.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.400
Thank you very much.
