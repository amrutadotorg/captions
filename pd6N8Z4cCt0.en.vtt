00:00:01.003 --> 00:00:06.670
Today we have come here

00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:12.628
to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.586
It's such a coincidence

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:19.878
that the Mother of Christ

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:22.586
came and stayed in Turkey.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.753
Isn't it surprising

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:27.753
that She should come here

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:33.461
after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here.

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:38.379
I wonder if He also came with Her later on?

00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:41.129
But they say then He went to Kashmir

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:43.254
and She was also there.

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:46.503
Quite possible, on their way

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.920
they might have gone there.

00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:55.254
So we are here to worship Him.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.670
According to Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.962
She was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:16.254
and She's the one who sacrificed Her Son

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:21.670
for the sake of religion.

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:25.670
But unfortunately,

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.379
nobody understood Her value.

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:32.461
Nobody saw

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:37.795
that She was such a great spiritual personality.

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:40.545
Only through Sahaja Yoga

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:43.212
you can understand that She was

00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:46.254
a very great personality

00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:50.545
who gave birth to Christ.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:00.379
It is very unfortunate

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:03.837
that She was not respected,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.586
specially in the Islamic world.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.503
Because of that,

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:17.878
the women in the Islamic culture have no place.

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:24.670
My experience is very sad about them.

00:02:26.878 --> 00:02:29.170
We have started an organization

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:32.670
for the rehabilitation of women

00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:36.837
who are destitutes and all of them

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.628
who have applied are Muslim ladies - very sad.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.295
While Muhammed Sahib has said

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:48.379
that "you must look after your mother"

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.670
despite that all these women

00:02:52.254 --> 00:02:57.170
some of them have eight children, ten children

00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:00.212
- have come to this destitute home.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.170
Of course, we have to give them place.

00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:06.753
We have to look after them

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.087
because we don't believe in all these

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.170
small type of ideas about religion.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.087
Most important is 'human' religion.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.212
We have to combine all these religions together.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.753
It's a terrible task

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.586
because Muslim won't respect Muslim.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.045
Christians - Christians won't respect Hindus.

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:37.711
I mean it's a funny thing that's going on.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.003
They all are for God

00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:44.337
and for God's work and His love.

00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.045
Despite that, there's no respect.

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:49.878
There's no love.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.586
On the contrary, they're all quarrelling, fighting,

00:03:53.753 --> 00:03:57.545
killing everywhere.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:00.087
It's very sad

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:04.170
that in the name of religion and God,

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:08.753
people should become so cruel and so absurd.

00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:12.212
This is the only solution-

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.379
is to give them Self Realization,

00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:21.711
which is the Realization

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:27.711
was called as miraj in the Koran.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.129
It's called as miraj.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.670
But they have said that nobody can get miraj.

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:37.670
Muhammed-sahib got it, but nobody else

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.379
- like they have banned people

00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:42.503
from getting Self Realization,

00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:44.087
which is not true.

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.420
All human beings can get Self Realization.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.586
Whether they are from Africa,

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.837
England, America, India, anywhere.

00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.212
They all can get their miraj.

00:05:03.962 --> 00:05:07.545
One should understand that no human being

00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:10.379
is created in this world to fight,

00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:12.295
to fight each other.

00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:15.254
Even the animals don't fight.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.045
Why should human beings fight

00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:20.129
- that, too, in the name of religion.

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:21.962
In the name of God,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.212
Christ came on this Earth

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:28.586
just to create oneness of religion,

00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:33.379
but even the Christians, they only started fighting,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.670
dominating others.

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:39.295
It's a big world of turmoil,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.170
where everybody is fighting in the name of God

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.045
and in the name of religion.

00:05:48.295 --> 00:05:50.711
So our religion is global,

00:05:51.753 --> 00:05:53.129
is one religion.

00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:56.003
We respect all the Deities,

00:05:57.545 --> 00:05:59.545
all the Gods and Goddesses

00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.045
- respect Them and worship Them.

00:06:04.962 --> 00:06:08.711
We are not so stupid

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:13.254
not to understand that They are all one.

00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:16.461
Also, after getting Realization,

00:06:16.795 --> 00:06:20.045
you realize that all these exist

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:22.670
on our central nervous system.

00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:25.670
They exist on our chakras.

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:29.503
They are not there

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.670
just because people have told us in history and all that,

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:36.753
but actually in that's a fact,

00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:40.254
that all of them are there together,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.837
working out the resurrection of the whole world.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.670
So the greatest thing that Christ has done

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.962
is the resurrection part

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.295
and in this resurrection, He suffered a lot.

00:06:54.503 --> 00:06:57.420
He had to go through lots of ordeals

00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:00.920
and then His body itself was resurrected.

00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:05.212
On the same lines, Sahaja Yoga is working out

00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:08.170
- that you get your Realization

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.212
means your resurrection.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.545
All your wrong ideas disappear.

00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:16.711
All your nonsense disappears

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.087
and nothing but love,

00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:22.628
understanding comes in.

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:26.586
It was difficult, I know, in the beginning

00:07:27.254 --> 00:07:31.420
to start this work in India or otherwise, also everywhere

00:07:31.628 --> 00:07:34.045
I found people are so ignorant

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.753
and human beings hate each other.

00:07:37.878 --> 00:07:40.920
With some excuse, ......... with

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:44.878
some sort of a - I don't know what ideas they have,

00:07:45.087 --> 00:07:48.586
historical ideas, and they hate.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.003
This hating in India has been there,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.129
but also abroad, like Hitler came in.

00:07:58.003 --> 00:08:00.920
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

00:08:01.503 --> 00:08:04.254
He was a satanic force who incarnated

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:08.129
and did all kinds of horrible things.

00:08:09.087 --> 00:08:11.295
The way he has killed people,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.962
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:18.170
He killed children.

00:08:19.087 --> 00:08:23.837
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.212
- such a horrible thing.

00:08:27.337 --> 00:08:28.379
When I went to Germany,

00:08:28.628 --> 00:08:30.586
they wanted Me to see all that.

00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:35.670
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.045
But My husband went there

00:08:39.254 --> 00:08:42.962
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

00:08:43.962 --> 00:08:45.003
It's so sickening.

00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:48.795
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:52.711
to kill people, under some circumstances,

00:08:53.254 --> 00:08:56.878
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

00:08:58.962 --> 00:09:02.379
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:06.545
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

00:09:08.962 --> 00:09:11.711
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:15.795
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

00:09:16.753 --> 00:09:19.670
Throughout, people have been killing

00:09:19.837 --> 00:09:21.254
in the name of religion.

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:23.962
Religion teaches you to love,

00:09:24.878 --> 00:09:27.129
to love God and love each other.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.379
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

00:09:32.962 --> 00:09:35.420
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:38.461
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.337
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

00:09:44.087 --> 00:09:47.420
and it should because, after all,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.212
we are all human beings.

00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:52.586
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.503
as Christ had.

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:58.920
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:01.586
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:02.295 --> 00:10:04.920
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

00:10:06.129 --> 00:10:08.920
He's described it very well, very clearly.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.337
But who wants that?

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.545
They don't want to have their miraj.

00:10:15.295 --> 00:10:17.129
If somebody tries to work it out,

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:20.379
they get after that person, saying

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:22.628
that "This is something ridiculous."

00:10:24.545 --> 00:10:25.753
It's all wrong.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.170
I mean this has happened with all of them.

00:10:32.045 --> 00:10:33.920
All of them have suffered

00:10:34.212 --> 00:10:37.254
because of the ignorance of human beings - all of them.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.670
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:48.420
But I am much more powerful,

00:10:48.753 --> 00:10:51.711
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

00:10:53.003 --> 00:10:55.045
And it's working out all over the world now,

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:59.753
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

00:10:59.962 --> 00:11:04.087
this kind of a wrong idea about others

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.337
is absolutely dangerous.

00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:14.420
And so, once large number of people know this,

00:11:15.545 --> 00:11:17.586
I'm sure it will all finish off.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.878
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:28.129
That just because you follow a particular religion,

00:11:28.545 --> 00:11:29.670
people hate you.

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:32.087
I mean I can't understand.

00:11:34.337 --> 00:11:37.212
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

00:11:37.212 --> 00:11:42.295
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

00:11:42.837 --> 00:11:47.170
in the name of God, who has created you.

00:11:47.545 --> 00:11:49.837
They don't understand God and His love.

00:11:53.503 --> 00:11:58.003
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

00:11:58.337 --> 00:12:00.920
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

00:12:01.212 --> 00:12:04.711
when He was crucified.

00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:08.753
His mother had to suffer so much.

00:12:10.837 --> 00:12:13.503
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

00:12:14.295 --> 00:12:16.795
Because He was teaching about love.

00:12:18.045 --> 00:12:22.295
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:25.962
How can you help people if you don't love?

00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:33.212
Under what premises do you help others?

00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:36.212
Because you love,

00:12:37.003 --> 00:12:40.254
that's why you want to enjoy others

00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:42.129
and to understand.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.670
Once you start loving others,

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:49.586
then this myth finishes off.

00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:53.003
Supposing you are born as a Christian

00:12:53.254 --> 00:12:55.545
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.670
what makes you think that you are different from others?

00:13:04.212 --> 00:13:05.753
You are born the same way.

00:13:06.962 --> 00:13:09.337
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:11.711
You look the same way.

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:15.254
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.837
What makes you different?

00:13:19.545 --> 00:13:22.087
I think it's something political about it,

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:25.461
something very mean

00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:30.586
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:33.962
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.878
unite all the people in the name of God,

00:13:38.337 --> 00:13:40.795
to make them one in the name of God.

00:13:41.962 --> 00:13:44.295
Supposing there is somebody living,

00:13:45.045 --> 00:13:47.670
say, in South Africa

00:13:49.003 --> 00:13:53.461
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:55.337
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:55.753 --> 00:13:59.212
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.711
They are all your bothers and sisters.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.045
They're your own.

00:14:04.586 --> 00:14:07.045
You go there and they will

00:14:07.337 --> 00:14:10.129
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:16.003
They will never think what religion you come from

00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:19.003
or what sect you come from, nothing.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.503
I was surprised the way they have love.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:26.711
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

00:14:27.795 --> 00:14:31.295
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

00:14:31.461 --> 00:14:35.295
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:41.212
But that capacity has become so much less,

00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:45.753
so much minimum, that, with that capacity,

00:14:46.045 --> 00:14:50.837
people fight and kill each other.

00:14:52.837 --> 00:14:57.045
It's a greatest sin to kill people in the name of religion.

00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:01.129
I don't know what - how they believe

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.295
that, by killing each other, we can go to heaven.

00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:07.170
They will go to the worst hell.

00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:14.795
This idea has now, of course, subsided a little,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.129
but still existing.

00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:19.711
They see it happening every day,

00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:25.337
this kind of a nonsense, but still they are continuing with it.

00:15:26.461 --> 00:15:28.670
Now what can we Sahaja Yogis do about it?

00:15:28.878 --> 00:15:29.962
We should think.

00:15:30.878 --> 00:15:34.461
Let us see, whatever religion we are born, that's what.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.087
You have to be born in some religion.

00:15:37.878 --> 00:15:39.461
You cannot drop from heaven.

00:15:41.295 --> 00:15:46.379
So whatever religion you are born, you are not bound by that.

00:15:47.503 --> 00:15:52.254
You are bound by the religion of love and joy.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.170
And then you go on crying and weeping

00:15:56.379 --> 00:16:03.337
and teaching and … of unhappiness, of fighting.

00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:06.878
How can that be? We are human beings.

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:08.379
They are not animals.

00:16:08.628 --> 00:16:10.461
Even the dogs don't do that way.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.920
Why should we human beings kill each other

00:16:15.003 --> 00:16:22.379
and make a miserable life for others and for yourself?

00:16:23.711 --> 00:16:25.503
Because if you hate others,

00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:28.461
you will also become hateful.

00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:33.837
A will hate the B and then the B will hate the A,

00:16:34.254 --> 00:16:37.379
so the whole human life and civilization

00:16:37.628 --> 00:16:40.003
has nothing to do but to hate!

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:47.254
Sahaja Yoga is such a blessing to you, I must say,

00:16:48.003 --> 00:16:52.129
because it has given to you all the Deities within you, enlightened

00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:55.212
and now you know you are belong to the whole.

00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:58.628
You know you are not belonging to some stupid ideas.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.129
It's very remarkable when I came here.

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:10.670
I knew Mary lived here. I knew Mother Mary lived here.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.045
There is a house of Mother Mary.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.753
That gave Me a very great joy to know that She had lived here

00:17:21.586 --> 00:17:23.795
and so I said we must worship Her.

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.920
After all, She was a mother of Christ!

00:17:28.878 --> 00:17:30.045
Mother is a mother.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.628
What does it matter whether She was a Christian, Hindu, Muslim?

00:17:34.837 --> 00:17:36.170
It doesn't matter.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.753
And for Her love, She allowed Her son to be sacrificed

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:44.711
for the whole world and for the universe - what a mother!

00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:48.170
Can you find such a mother in this world

00:17:48.878 --> 00:17:52.920
who will allow Her own son to be crucified -

00:17:55.628 --> 00:18:01.545
such a courageous, loving and global personality.

00:18:03.295 --> 00:18:06.711
Here we are. It's a coincidence, as I said,

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.795
because She lived here.

00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:10.545
Why did She come?

00:18:12.837 --> 00:18:15.295
Why did She come here? She could have gone directly.

00:18:16.254 --> 00:18:21.212
She came here and lived and we have a house of Her.

00:18:21.795 --> 00:18:23.170
Now with this house only,

00:18:23.379 --> 00:18:25.503
the Christians will start a cult.

00:18:26.878 --> 00:18:30.129
They'll fight with the Muslims

00:18:30.503 --> 00:18:33.920
and the Muslims will fight with the Christians.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.295
Anything you do, they will fight.

00:18:36.837 --> 00:18:39.753
That's the main character is to fight,

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:44.254
not to help others, not to help each other - no, not at all.

00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:50.129
They're just trying to be very, very funny and nasty.

00:18:52.129 --> 00:18:56.337
In India we have had so many nice people

00:18:56.545 --> 00:18:58.670
who taught that we must love each other.

00:18:59.878 --> 00:19:02.212
Despite that, in India people are fighting.

00:19:04.379 --> 00:19:06.837
They have had so many Sufis in this country.

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:09.212
In the same way, in India also,

00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:14.129
we have had very great saints, very great - everywhere.

00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:16.379
Some of them were Muslims,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.503
some of them were Hindus

00:19:19.003 --> 00:19:21.753
and people sing their songs; everything's there.

00:19:22.087 --> 00:19:28.087
But, they're worshipped separately

00:19:28.295 --> 00:19:30.670
and people fight even in their names.

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.379
They want to find something to fight.

00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:37.087
Real fighting cocks, I tell you they are.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.003
They haven't got a human quality within them,

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:44.212
which is love, which is affection-

00:19:45.295 --> 00:19:48.170
must enjoy your love for each other.

00:19:49.003 --> 00:19:52.586
That's the thing they have lost their capacity to love.

00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:56.962
What does it matter if somebody is born

00:19:57.254 --> 00:19:59.628
in China or in India or anywhere?

00:20:00.337 --> 00:20:01.753
He is a human being.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.170
He, too, has the capacity to love

00:20:05.545 --> 00:20:08.837
and you should also have capacity to love.

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.129
My experience is different.

00:20:14.545 --> 00:20:16.503
I went to China with My husband.

00:20:17.461 --> 00:20:18.379
In China

00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:21.379
that time, they didn't have any good feelings for Indians,

00:20:21.628 --> 00:20:22.545
I don't know why.

00:20:23.878 --> 00:20:27.212
But they were so kind to Me, you won't believe,

00:20:28.586 --> 00:20:29.962
so nice to Me

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:32.670
and the way they treated Me,

00:20:32.878 --> 00:20:35.170
everybody was surprised, " What's the matter? "

00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:38.379
"How are they so kind to you? "

00:20:38.878 --> 00:20:40.920
"In China they don't like Indians."

00:20:41.837 --> 00:20:43.003
I said, "It's a myth. "

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:45.753
"I don't think I have seen that with the Chinese. "

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:52.545
"They're extremely, extremely kind and respectful to Me. "

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.711
"What have I done for them? Nothing."

00:20:56.295 --> 00:20:58.837
Well, you'll be surprised, in one of the hotels,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.254
one of My ankle ornament[s] had fallen down - silver.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.087
It did happen and then I went away to a very far fetched place

00:21:14.087 --> 00:21:17.670
and they sent it in an envelope, those anklets.

00:21:18.212 --> 00:21:19.295
Can you imagine?

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.379
All the way - I was so much full of tears.

00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:29.920
So I said "These Chinese are also very loving people,

00:21:30.129 --> 00:21:31.962
extremely loving."

00:21:32.545 --> 00:21:35.545
I went for My program.

00:21:37.003 --> 00:21:40.129
We had a women's conference.

00:21:41.503 --> 00:21:42.920
So I don't know why,

00:21:43.753 --> 00:21:47.045
but at the airport only these Chinese boys arrived.

00:21:48.129 --> 00:21:50.545
They took all My luggage. I was so late!

00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:56.254
The function was at ten o'clock and I reached about 8:30.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.503
They put Me in the car.

00:21:59.212 --> 00:22:00.670
They put My luggage there

00:22:00.837 --> 00:22:02.628
and they said, "We have to directly

00:22:02.837 --> 00:22:05.420
go to the conference." I said, "All right."

00:22:06.295 --> 00:22:10.295
I went there and in this short time,

00:22:10.586 --> 00:22:13.670
these boys were really so attached to Me.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.586
When I finished the conference, they're waiting outside

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:19.337
- can't believe it -

00:22:19.628 --> 00:22:23.254
the same Chinese people who are against Indians.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.628
And then, after that, it didn't stop.

00:22:27.878 --> 00:22:29.087
They brought two cars -

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.129
one for My wheelchair, one for Me

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.878
- and they took Me to the best shopping places.

00:22:39.461 --> 00:22:41.045
But I said, "What will you do?"

00:22:41.503 --> 00:22:43.753
They said, 'We'll carry your wheelchair upstairs.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.295
Can you imagine?

00:22:46.045 --> 00:22:47.962
They were no relation of mine.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.087
I've never seen them before.

00:22:51.337 --> 00:22:52.920
So one of them said,

00:22:53.129 --> 00:22:56.628
"Tomorrow, Mother, I won't be able to come." I said, "Why?"

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.711
He said, "I'm getting married tomorrow."

00:22:59.129 --> 00:23:01.379
And I said, "What have you been doing all this day?"

00:23:03.337 --> 00:23:05.586
He said, "I enjoyed your company so much"

00:23:05.795 --> 00:23:08.379
I'm such an old woman like Me - young people.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.753
"No, no, no, no, I've enjoyed.

00:23:10.878 --> 00:23:14.503
I'll also bring my bride for You to be seen."

00:23:14.795 --> 00:23:15.795
I tell you,

00:23:16.379 --> 00:23:18.003
tears came into my eyes.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.628
I said, "Such love, such kindness."

00:23:22.045 --> 00:23:24.170
I didn't do anything for them, nothing.

00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:26.628
I didn't give them any money, nothing.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.920
My goodness, till the end they were so much attentive to Me

00:23:32.586 --> 00:23:36.503
- very young boys, all below twenty-five years of age.

00:23:38.337 --> 00:23:40.503
And they carried My Wheelchair

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:43.920
up three storeys with their hands.

00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:46.087
I said, "Don't do it, I don't want …"

00:23:46.212 --> 00:23:48.212
(They said,) "No, no, no, no, we want You to see."

00:23:48.337 --> 00:23:49.878
"We want You to come."

00:23:51.212 --> 00:23:52.045
I said, "Why?"

00:23:52.878 --> 00:23:54.837
[They] said, "It would be nice for all of them."

00:23:55.337 --> 00:23:57.628
I don't know what made them think like that.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.670
Such enlightened people, I tell you.

00:24:01.045 --> 00:24:03.129
With love, you get enlightened.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.087
With love, you get understanding.

00:24:08.295 --> 00:24:11.087
And such deep love exists within you.

00:24:11.878 --> 00:24:13.711
Now the politicians will come

00:24:13.837 --> 00:24:15.254
and tell you a story.

00:24:15.586 --> 00:24:17.461
Then somebody else will tell you,

00:24:17.711 --> 00:24:19.379
"Come and fight" and all that.

00:24:19.711 --> 00:24:22.503
That's how they have managed in Germany, young people.

00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:28.087
But now, now they're changing.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.337
All this world has to change

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.753
because it has suffered a lot.

00:24:34.379 --> 00:24:35.962
This is no religion.

00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:40.711
This is not the teachings of the saints - no.

00:24:41.503 --> 00:24:42.711
It is not.

00:24:42.962 --> 00:24:46.711
It is devilish, that teaches you to hate others,

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.628
is the worst thing.

00:24:49.503 --> 00:24:53.170
I mean all the enjoyment of love,

00:24:54.212 --> 00:24:58.962
all the enjoyment of affection, you don't know.

00:25:01.962 --> 00:25:05.170
Nowadays, you see the problem of the churches, this, that.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.503
I can't understand, stupid people.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.628
They have done so many laws

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.795
and with that laws, whatever it is, whatever may be the causes,

00:25:16.503 --> 00:25:20.670
but what's happening is that poor children are suffering.

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:24.753
They have no sense of pure love.

00:25:26.837 --> 00:25:29.753
Nobody understands what is poor love is.

00:25:30.003 --> 00:25:33.461
Which is actually their innate quality, their innate -

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.087
I should say the 'property'.

00:25:37.087 --> 00:25:41.795
But they don't know how you can love somebody purely!

00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:48.586
It's all something very, very wretched.

00:25:48.837 --> 00:25:51.628
It doesn't behove human beings to be like that.

00:25:52.045 --> 00:25:53.962
Even the animals are not like that,

00:25:55.087 --> 00:25:57.920
but human beings can go to any extreme.

00:25:59.628 --> 00:26:01.379
The whole wealth of beauty,

00:26:01.586 --> 00:26:03.837
the whole wealth of creativity,

00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:07.670
the whole wealth of art, artistic temperament,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.503
the whole wealth of enjoying life is finished.

00:26:13.461 --> 00:26:15.670
If you are a fighting cock,

00:26:16.711 --> 00:26:20.795
you can't see anything, any good in anyone, in anything.

00:26:21.837 --> 00:26:23.420
They will fight others

00:26:23.628 --> 00:26:26.295
and they'll fight among themselves also - is a fact.

00:26:27.045 --> 00:26:29.628
They might say, "We must fight." All right, fight.

00:26:29.837 --> 00:26:33.170
But then they fight among themselves also.

00:26:33.379 --> 00:26:37.170
They will torture their own brothers and sisters.

00:26:37.962 --> 00:26:41.878
I mean, they don't love anyone. This is the main thing is.

00:26:42.254 --> 00:26:44.087
Why take the name of religion?

00:26:45.254 --> 00:26:47.003
What the religion has done?

00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:49.753
How could the religion teach you such a

00:26:49.962 --> 00:26:53.337
horrible thing like hatred for your own?

00:26:55.628 --> 00:26:59.170
It's not only among Christians, Hindus, Muslims, but

00:26:59.379 --> 00:27:05.837
everywhere human beings have become very dirty and filthy.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.503
They say it is Kali Yuga.

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.962
I can't understand.

00:27:12.045 --> 00:27:14.170
How can you lose the power to love?

00:27:14.586 --> 00:27:17.129
That's what Christ has talked about.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.129
He's talked about love very clearly.

00:27:21.295 --> 00:27:24.087
He said, "Love thy neighbour as thyself."

00:27:24.337 --> 00:27:26.129
Have you found anyone like that?

00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:31.670
You don't find all such people.

00:27:32.503 --> 00:27:36.920
The Christians who followed Christ, what did they do?

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.586
Muslims who followed Mohammed-sahib, what did they do?

00:27:42.337 --> 00:27:46.170
And Hindus who followed Shri Rama, what did they do?

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.087
Are they anywhere near their leaders?

00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:53.920
Are they anywhere near those Incarnations of the Divine?

00:27:54.129 --> 00:27:55.129
Nowhere.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.045
The reason is - I don't blame them

00:27:58.461 --> 00:28:00.461
- because they had no Realization.

00:28:01.628 --> 00:28:03.461
They didn't know their spirit.

00:28:04.087 --> 00:28:05.795
If you have no Realization,

00:28:06.295 --> 00:28:08.753
you cannot understand anything,

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:13.254
you cannot understand any enjoyment or anything.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.962
I mean,

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:18.670
if you go to Germany,

00:28:20.379 --> 00:28:23.379
you can't go and see all the things they have done.

00:28:24.003 --> 00:28:27.545
You'll faint, if you have any human qualities.

00:28:28.212 --> 00:28:30.837
Even you go to Japan

00:28:31.129 --> 00:28:34.129
and they way they had put this Hiroshima,

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:36.829
this - my goodness,

00:28:37.337 --> 00:28:40.003
I started trembling, I couldn't bear it.

00:28:40.254 --> 00:28:43.753
I said, "How could human beings be that cruel?"

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.962
Horrible!

00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:49.044
I mean now the days have come that

00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:51.514
they're killing their own children.

00:28:51.586 --> 00:28:52.962
Extreme is this.

00:28:54.129 --> 00:28:56.379
The other side of it is Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:57.212 --> 00:29:00.795
in which you love all human beings

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.461
because they're human beings.

00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:08.170
They're born with you in this time.

00:29:09.254 --> 00:29:10.920
You have to help each other

00:29:11.337 --> 00:29:12.753
and love each other.

00:29:14.254 --> 00:29:15.680
This is the main thing.

00:29:15.711 --> 00:29:17.545
If you can develop this,

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.420
you'll be very, very strong Sahaja Yogis

00:29:20.962 --> 00:29:24.379
and you will be supported and blessed by the Divine.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.337
Divine will help you

00:29:27.753 --> 00:29:30.129
and take you out of all troubles

00:29:30.586 --> 00:29:34.295
and tribulations and all kinds of difficulties,

00:29:34.795 --> 00:29:38.503
if you are a loving personality.

00:29:39.087 --> 00:29:41.795
This is what the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:29:42.045 --> 00:29:43.212
It didn't exist (like this before.)

00:29:43.628 --> 00:29:48.003
Now, if you are a loving person,

00:29:48.878 --> 00:29:52.003
the Divine will go out of the way to help you,

00:29:52.545 --> 00:29:54.586
to sort out your problems,

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.170
to punish those who are troubling you.

00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:59.837
I mean, it's My own experience like that.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.254
I never do anything. I never curse anybody.

00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.920
I don't fight. I don't shout.

00:30:06.503 --> 00:30:08.461
Automatically, it works.

00:30:09.337 --> 00:30:11.711
I don't even tell the Divine to do anything.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:19.295
The Divine is at the greatest, just personality,

00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:22.962
I should say. That is the one who does all the justice.

00:30:23.962 --> 00:30:28.962
Nobody can suffer under the guidance and love of Divine,

00:30:29.212 --> 00:30:30.170
take it from Me.

00:30:30.878 --> 00:30:32.711
This is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.129
I agree Kali Yuga is horrible.

00:30:35.545 --> 00:30:37.878
People are horrible. This is that.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.461
But there's one thing

00:30:40.878 --> 00:30:46.295
that this Divine has become very alert.

00:30:46.461 --> 00:30:47.920
It was never that alert.

00:30:49.003 --> 00:30:50.920
If Christ was born at this time,

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.003
He could not have been crucified.

00:30:56.212 --> 00:31:00.503
It's only because He was not born during Kali Yuga.

00:31:01.503 --> 00:31:03.628
That's a very big blessing for us.

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.711
Nobody can be tortured.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.337
Nobody can be troubled.

00:31:09.379 --> 00:31:12.795
Only thing, you have to be a humble person.

00:31:13.795 --> 00:31:15.837
You have to have a good character

00:31:16.753 --> 00:31:21.003
and you have to have a very loving personality.

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.503
That's all.

00:31:22.878 --> 00:31:25.045
You'll enjoy the loving personality.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.711
You'll get the blessings

00:31:28.379 --> 00:31:30.087
because [of] you're loving personality.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.003
I mean, the way the Divine looks after you,

00:31:33.545 --> 00:31:35.962
there are so many miracles people tell Me.

00:31:36.586 --> 00:31:38.545
I'm not surprised because I know

00:31:38.837 --> 00:31:42.045
the Divine has become extremely alert

00:31:42.628 --> 00:31:45.878
towards human beings who are good and nice.

00:31:46.503 --> 00:31:47.586
It will look after.

00:31:47.878 --> 00:31:50.129
It will support. It will do everything.

00:31:51.254 --> 00:31:54.962
It's very surprising that it has become so alert.

00:31:55.711 --> 00:31:57.795
Like Muahmmed-sahib suffered so much.

00:31:58.087 --> 00:32:01.503
Everybody suffered so much, but not now.

00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:03.628
Now the Sahaja Yogis won't suffer.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.129
Take it from Me.

00:32:05.878 --> 00:32:08.920
They're looked after by the Divine itself.

00:32:09.586 --> 00:32:12.170
Everything is looked after. I will tell you,

00:32:12.337 --> 00:32:15.503
people have written letters after letters all over the world,

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.586
how they have been supported,

00:32:18.087 --> 00:32:19.837
how they have been helped.

00:32:20.545 --> 00:32:24.461
Very surprising how they have been rescued.

00:32:28.753 --> 00:32:33.337
So we have to trust in ourselves

00:32:34.295 --> 00:32:37.628
and we have to really love people.

00:32:38.545 --> 00:32:41.254
We should be humble and love.

00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:45.753
All this love will help you all your life.

00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:49.170
This is the message of Christ.

00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:51.962
Christ has said, "Forgive them."

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.586
How lovingly He said,

00:32:53.753 --> 00:32:56.628
"But they don't know what they're doing."

00:32:57.461 --> 00:32:59.586
Very lovingly He pleads

00:32:59.837 --> 00:33:02.628
for all the bad people who crucified Him,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.962
that "Oh, Lord, please forgive them

00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:07.628
because they don't know what they are doing."

00:33:08.212 --> 00:33:11.503
Can you imagine such a loving character of Christ?

00:33:11.837 --> 00:33:18.045
And now, when we are celebrating and worshipping Him,

00:33:18.503 --> 00:33:21.045
we have to worship that character within us,

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.503
that we are also loving people.

00:33:23.837 --> 00:33:25.003
We love each other.

00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:28.962
All over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis love each other.

00:33:29.295 --> 00:33:32.254
Of course, there could be one or two who are not so good,

00:33:32.461 --> 00:33:36.461
but mostly, ninety-nine percent Sahaja Yogis love each other.

00:33:37.087 --> 00:33:39.795
My blessings to you is this -

00:33:40.003 --> 00:33:44.670
on this day may God give you lots of love,

00:33:45.503 --> 00:33:48.461
and loving capacity within you,

00:33:49.087 --> 00:33:50.753
that you should have,

00:33:51.045 --> 00:33:53.670
which will change your life completely

00:33:54.003 --> 00:33:57.129
and you'll become such a powerful personality,

00:33:57.711 --> 00:34:00.254
very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:01.254 --> 00:34:04.628
You can do marvels and miracles

00:34:05.337 --> 00:34:09.628
if you have developed the understanding of love.

00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:12.628
May God bless you
