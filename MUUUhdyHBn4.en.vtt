00:14:40.052 --> 00:14:42.885
We all have today gathered here

00:14:43.218 --> 00:14:46.801
on top of this beautiful mountain,

00:14:48.594 --> 00:14:52.218
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:14:53.594 --> 00:14:57.177
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

00:14:57.634 --> 00:15:03.594
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:07.968
by which He showed

00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:11.634
that the spirit does not die.

00:15:12.634 --> 00:15:16.427
He was – He was the Omkara,

00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:21.177
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:27.344
and that is why He could walk on the water.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:33.218
And also now we have made a film

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.801
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

00:15:39.093 --> 00:15:42.344
which shows the carbon atom,

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:46.634
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.594
you find a proper swastika there;

00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:56.344
and left to the right we see Omkara.

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:59.344
But when you see from down below upward,

00:15:59.634 --> 00:16:03.344
what you see is alpha and omega.

00:16:03.926 --> 00:16:08.218
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:11.885
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:18.760
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:16:19.801 --> 00:16:23.135
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:29.135
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

00:16:30.594 --> 00:16:34.093
I don’t know at the time of Christ

00:16:34.469 --> 00:16:38.260
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

00:16:38.634 --> 00:16:40.885
but definitely to Him

00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:46.010
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.052
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

00:16:59.635 --> 00:17:04.760
and very important for our ascent.

00:17:06.302 --> 00:17:09.676
If He had not resurrected Himself,

00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:14.218
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

00:17:14.843 --> 00:17:17.635
So it’s a great contribution.

00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:22.885
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.843
what you were before

00:17:27.218 --> 00:17:30.427
and what you are today.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:36.344
It is such a change,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.885
such a difference,

00:17:39.177 --> 00:17:42.135
such a transformation.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.594
It is His own sacrifice

00:17:47.052 --> 00:17:48.510
on the cross

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.510
and His own

00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:55.552
beautiful resurrection

00:17:55.843 --> 00:17:59.052
has created a way for all of us

00:17:59.385 --> 00:18:04.634
to get into this new transformed state.

00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:15.260
In this state is a different story for human beings,

00:18:15.634 --> 00:18:18.093
and a different for Christ.

00:18:18.427 --> 00:18:20.510
Christ was Himself

00:18:20.843 --> 00:18:25.010
was holiness, was purity.

00:18:26.469 --> 00:18:28.968
So His resurrection

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:35.718
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

00:18:37.344 --> 00:18:41.218
because He did not need transformation,

00:18:42.843 --> 00:18:44.801
He did not

00:18:45.093 --> 00:18:49.594
have to go through any cleansing.

00:18:51.052 --> 00:18:54.385
But what happened in His case

00:18:55.052 --> 00:19:00.177
was that He became

00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:04.843
resurrected from death

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:09.885
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.843
is like a death;

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:15.218
because they do everything

00:19:15.594 --> 00:19:21.177
without any understanding about the totality,

00:19:22.385 --> 00:19:24.552
about the reality,

00:19:24.885 --> 00:19:27.926
about the absolute truth.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.510
Whatever they do ultimately

00:19:30.926 --> 00:19:35.010
takes them to their destruction.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:40.010
Even the religions which are established

00:19:40.385 --> 00:19:42.469
by these great incarnations

00:19:42.843 --> 00:19:47.260
are absolutely on a decline.

00:19:47.635 --> 00:19:51.635
You do not find any trace of religious life

00:19:52.052 --> 00:19:53.552
with all those people

00:19:53.885 --> 00:19:56.760
who claim that they are the ones

00:19:57.093 --> 00:20:00.885
who can represent those incarnations.

00:20:01.594 --> 00:20:04.635
If you see in a subtle way

00:20:05.052 --> 00:20:06.968
it’s very painful also,

00:20:07.344 --> 00:20:11.469
that in the name of all these great incarnations

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:14.385
the kind of work people are doing,

00:20:14.801 --> 00:20:19.344
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:22.634
because they have no fear of God.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.135
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

00:20:26.427 --> 00:20:28.135
all over the world.

00:20:28.469 --> 00:20:29.552
Of course here,

00:20:29.843 --> 00:20:31.760
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

00:20:32.093 --> 00:20:34.010
Everywhere people are seeing

00:20:34.427 --> 00:20:37.676
all these false things have been exposed.

00:20:38.052 --> 00:20:41.926
But these false things they have used

00:20:42.469 --> 00:20:46.385
under a garb of God,

00:20:46.676 --> 00:20:49.594
spirituality and beauty.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.218
That’s the best way you can hide.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.718
All the cruelty, all the violence,

00:20:59.635 --> 00:21:02.552
all the ugliness

00:21:03.469 --> 00:21:05.885
– this is how they have worked it out.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.968
And it has gone into such a state

00:21:10.385 --> 00:21:13.385
that you do not find the slightest

00:21:13.801 --> 00:21:18.260
even tinge of religious life among these people.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.676
Like all the thieves of the world,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.968
all the great crooks of the world

00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:26.968
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

00:21:29.218 --> 00:21:33.510
It’s only because what was written in all the books

00:21:33.843 --> 00:21:37.676
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

00:21:38.177 --> 00:21:40.635
was never done.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:45.634
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.469
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

00:21:49.885 --> 00:21:52.260
He also said that “You are to be born again”

00:21:52.676 --> 00:21:55.552
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

00:21:55.926 --> 00:22:01.385
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

00:22:02.968 --> 00:22:05.676
But they don’t think that actually

00:22:06.052 --> 00:22:08.635
what benevolence it has given them.

00:22:09.052 --> 00:22:10.885
At the most they might have made some money,

00:22:11.302 --> 00:22:14.676
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

00:22:15.052 --> 00:22:21.052
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:27.801
One must pity their insanity,

00:22:28.552 --> 00:22:32.260
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:34.177
or to anybody else’s life

00:22:34.552 --> 00:22:38.885
of such a noble and a higher value system,

00:22:39.344 --> 00:22:45.385
and are doing all very low-graded things.

00:22:47.344 --> 00:22:52.552
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

00:22:53.135 --> 00:22:56.718
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

00:22:57.385 --> 00:23:01.427
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

00:23:01.801 --> 00:23:06.427
that you are coming from that environment,

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.634
that style of life,

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.260
that kind of thinking

00:23:12.634 --> 00:23:14.843
which was all for your destruction.

00:23:15.218 --> 00:23:19.510
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.552
So when you’re coming out of it,

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.010
still these things hang over,

00:23:26.427 --> 00:23:31.385
still you get affected by them.

00:23:31.926 --> 00:23:34.594
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

00:23:34.885 --> 00:23:38.177
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.052
to some sort of a funny situation,

00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:46.843
to some sort of a degrading things.

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:50.302
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:53.552
sometimes you accept all that.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.344
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

00:23:56.634 --> 00:23:58.427
that after coming to realization

00:23:58.843 --> 00:24:01.843
he has to be very introspective.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.093
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

00:24:04.427 --> 00:24:08.218
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.968
It’s very important that you have to know

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:17.302
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

00:24:17.968 --> 00:24:22.177
Because Christ did not need this,

00:24:22.801 --> 00:24:26.510
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:33.344
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

00:24:34.218 --> 00:24:40.510
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

00:24:40.843 --> 00:24:43.177
on the sense that from He died

00:24:43.634 --> 00:24:46.676
and then He resurrected Himself.

00:24:47.135 --> 00:24:50.385
But for us it is very different.

00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:53.801
We are now Sahaja yogis,

00:24:54.177 --> 00:24:57.676
but we were ordinary human beings.

00:24:58.093 --> 00:25:00.552
We had no light within us.

00:25:00.926 --> 00:25:02.968
Now the light comes within us

00:25:03.344 --> 00:25:05.634
and we see the light,

00:25:05.968 --> 00:25:09.344
then what do we become?

00:25:09.718 --> 00:25:13.218
We have to become the light itself.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.385
Christ was the light.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.302
He did not have to become.

00:25:17.635 --> 00:25:19.635
So we have to become the light.

00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:23.843
And now you have to guard on

00:25:24.718 --> 00:25:28.302
the way this light might get disturbed,

00:25:28.635 --> 00:25:33.968
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:40.093
So carrying on yourself with this light,

00:25:40.427 --> 00:25:42.801
first thing you should know that

00:25:43.218 --> 00:25:45.469
if you see the light, is not proper

00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:47.135
– means you are not the light.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.968
You have to become the light.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.801
When you are the light,

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.843
then in that light you can easily see

00:25:57.177 --> 00:25:59.676
how your mind works,

00:26:00.177 --> 00:26:02.260
what ideas it gives,

00:26:02.635 --> 00:26:09.177
what affects your mind

00:26:09.885 --> 00:26:11.843
while you’re ascending.

00:26:12.177 --> 00:26:14.093
Is this the worry

00:26:14.385 --> 00:26:19.885
or is this the responsibility that you have?

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.510
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

00:26:24.926 --> 00:26:26.676
that there is an impediment

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:32.177
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

00:26:32.885 --> 00:26:35.634
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:41.010
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.510
It’s a very beautiful journey

00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:47.594
– very, very beautiful journey.

00:26:48.052 --> 00:26:50.260
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

00:26:50.634 --> 00:26:55.260
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

00:26:56.427 --> 00:27:01.510
the journey of kundalini.

00:27:03.594 --> 00:27:11.218
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

00:27:12.885 --> 00:27:17.594
Basically you were not a realized soul,

00:27:18.177 --> 00:27:20.843
but now you are a realized soul.

00:27:21.344 --> 00:27:23.218
You are a evolved state.

00:27:23.676 --> 00:27:29.427
Now what is missing is the idea

00:27:29.885 --> 00:27:34.843
that we are absolutely all right

00:27:35.344 --> 00:27:39.635
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

00:27:41.052 --> 00:27:45.676
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

00:27:46.177 --> 00:27:48.843
it’s not going to help you at all.

00:27:49.344 --> 00:27:52.344
What you have to do is to

00:27:53.135 --> 00:27:54.968
all the time introspect yourself.

00:27:55.385 --> 00:27:57.552
That’s what is meditation for,

00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.469
to see for yourself

00:27:59.801 --> 00:28:03.926
how you are keeping up

00:28:04.427 --> 00:28:07.594
your spiritual ascent.

00:28:08.093 --> 00:28:09.510
No one else can do it,

00:28:09.926 --> 00:28:12.344
it’s your own individual work.

00:28:12.634 --> 00:28:14.594
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

00:28:14.843 --> 00:28:17.635
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.760
They may not say, they may not refer it,

00:28:22.177 --> 00:28:23.634
but they will know definitely

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.760
that such-and-such chakra is catching

00:28:26.177 --> 00:28:28.093
and this person has this problem.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:33.218
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.718
what is their problem is.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.177
So if somebody tells you

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.427
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

00:28:42.718 --> 00:28:45.427
you should never, never feel bad about it,

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.469
because by keeping that chakra intact

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.676
you are ruining your own life.

00:28:52.177 --> 00:28:54.634
So what you have to do is to see

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.760
that if somebody tells you that

00:28:57.135 --> 00:29:01.052
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

00:29:01.427 --> 00:29:04.010
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

00:29:04.427 --> 00:29:07.010
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

00:29:07.385 --> 00:29:09.552
there’s something wrong with your face,

00:29:09.843 --> 00:29:11.260
you can immediately correct it.

00:29:11.634 --> 00:29:15.260
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

00:29:15.635 --> 00:29:19.052
you have to be mature enough that you should know

00:29:19.385 --> 00:29:21.052
that it is a great blessing

00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:24.552
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

00:29:25.552 --> 00:29:27.218
Like the other day there was some quarrel

00:29:27.552 --> 00:29:28.968
between the two leaders.

00:29:29.344 --> 00:29:31.801
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

00:29:32.093 --> 00:29:33.385
There should not be.

00:29:33.594 --> 00:29:37.177
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

00:29:37.552 --> 00:29:38.843
two legs do not fight.

00:29:39.218 --> 00:29:42.135
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

00:29:42.552 --> 00:29:46.676
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

00:29:47.469 --> 00:29:50.260
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

00:29:50.634 --> 00:29:55.218
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

00:29:55.718 --> 00:29:59.260
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

00:29:59.718 --> 00:30:01.926
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

00:30:02.344 --> 00:30:03.926
When he puts his hand towards Me,

00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:07.218
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

00:30:07.552 --> 00:30:09.760
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

00:30:10.135 --> 00:30:13.968
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

00:30:14.344 --> 00:30:16.469
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

00:30:16.801 --> 00:30:20.510
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

00:30:21.344 --> 00:30:26.594
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

00:30:26.968 --> 00:30:29.510
because I said it to him.

00:30:30.135 --> 00:30:33.093
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

00:30:33.594 --> 00:30:35.427
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

00:30:35.843 --> 00:30:36.885
what is good for him.

00:30:37.177 --> 00:30:38.635
He did not feel bad at all.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.135
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.302
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:49.052
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

00:30:56.052 --> 00:30:59.635
Now, the problem with us is that

00:30:59.968 --> 00:31:04.260
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

00:31:05.344 --> 00:31:07.760
and we have consolidated it.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.260
Also, we have a great collective force,

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:13.135
I can see, in every country.

00:31:13.594 --> 00:31:16.302
We can give realizations to so many,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.302
and we can really establish

00:31:19.718 --> 00:31:24.427
all these great truths in our lives.

00:31:24.843 --> 00:31:26.260
We can do it.

00:31:26.594 --> 00:31:30.135
All the time we should establish them.

00:31:30.926 --> 00:31:34.302
But there is one point

00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:37.760
on which one should not be very sure:

00:31:38.218 --> 00:31:44.385
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:48.052
You have to be careful on this point very much.

00:31:48.469 --> 00:31:54.260
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:54.635 --> 00:31:59.344
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

00:32:00.427 --> 00:32:03.760
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

00:32:04.302 --> 00:32:07.552
The reason is that they have no faith

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:14.510
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:18.594
This is the faith which is missing.

00:32:19.177 --> 00:32:23.801
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

00:32:24.385 --> 00:32:28.760
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:37.093
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.801
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

00:32:45.135 --> 00:32:46.926
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.344
– you have known that it is so.

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:51.344
But even knowing that,

00:32:51.676 --> 00:32:55.177
it has not become such a faith within you.

00:32:55.635 --> 00:32:59.427
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

00:32:59.843 --> 00:33:02.302
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

00:33:02.634 --> 00:33:04.135
not the blind faith.

00:33:04.552 --> 00:33:07.968
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.510
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:17.760
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

00:33:18.218 --> 00:33:20.385
There cannot be any problems

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.218
if your faith is enlightened.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.885
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

00:33:28.302 --> 00:33:31.718
many people who are very steady,

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:36.635
who are upright,

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.510
who are very valuable.

00:33:40.052 --> 00:33:41.843
They are like the people

00:33:42.218 --> 00:33:45.385
who know they are standing on the rocks.

00:33:45.926 --> 00:33:49.968
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.385
they think they are still dwindling

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.469
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

00:34:01.594 --> 00:34:05.676
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

00:34:06.135 --> 00:34:10.302
and also that has come out of faith

00:34:10.635 --> 00:34:13.801
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.801
nothing can trouble us.

00:34:17.344 --> 00:34:20.635
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

00:34:21.052 --> 00:34:22.718
I mean, He knew everything,

00:34:23.093 --> 00:34:25.135
so He was sure about it.

00:34:25.634 --> 00:34:29.302
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:33.344
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.385
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:39.552
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

00:34:39.926 --> 00:34:41.801
It is so.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.469
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

00:34:46.926 --> 00:34:50.302
while the other people,

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.926
even Sahaja yogis,

00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:58.594
have to become like Christ

00:34:58.926 --> 00:35:01.843
as far as the faith is concerned.

00:35:02.427 --> 00:35:06.801
This faith is to be understood.

00:35:07.676 --> 00:35:10.427
This is an enlightened faith.

00:35:10.843 --> 00:35:15.135
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

00:35:15.552 --> 00:35:18.010
He went into all kinds of things,

00:35:18.469 --> 00:35:22.427
just because He knew it was just a drama

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.052
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.801
and there’s nothing serious,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.968
nothing is going to matter,

00:35:33.302 --> 00:35:34.801
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

00:35:35.177 --> 00:35:37.427
He played the drama.

00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:41.385
To Him it was nothing very serious.

00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:47.634
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.385
He also in His heart knew everything that

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.760
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

00:35:57.469 --> 00:36:01.634
But at the same time,

00:36:02.635 --> 00:36:05.552
He was the embodiment of faith:

00:36:06.052 --> 00:36:10.552
faith in Himself

00:36:10.885 --> 00:36:14.634
and in this all-pervading Power.

00:36:16.052 --> 00:36:18.344
This never lets you down,

00:36:18.801 --> 00:36:23.718
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

00:36:24.427 --> 00:36:29.177
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

00:36:30.427 --> 00:36:34.510
naturally I will give him all the work,

00:36:35.093 --> 00:36:37.427
I will trust everything,

00:36:37.843 --> 00:36:40.760
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

00:36:41.093 --> 00:36:44.385
never doubt such a person.

00:36:45.552 --> 00:36:50.801
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

00:36:51.469 --> 00:36:58.260
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

00:36:59.052 --> 00:37:03.177
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

00:37:04.968 --> 00:37:06.760
how life will improve

00:37:07.218 --> 00:37:12.344
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

00:37:12.885 --> 00:37:15.177
You’ll have no doubts,

00:37:15.552 --> 00:37:20.302
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

00:37:22.926 --> 00:37:27.093
So, this is such a state

00:37:27.634 --> 00:37:29.344
– only with faith.

00:37:29.843 --> 00:37:32.594
But now this faith, how do you get?

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:37.177
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

00:37:37.552 --> 00:37:38.968
There’s no course about it,

00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:41.177
there’s no literature about it,

00:37:41.552 --> 00:37:43.801
there’s no lecture about it.

00:37:44.218 --> 00:37:49.676
But there is an awakening within you

00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:54.177
which will ask this

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.218
“What am I?” – this awakening,

00:37:57.594 --> 00:38:00.010
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:05.843
You see, this will question

00:38:07.926 --> 00:38:11.718
“What is it that I have achieved?

00:38:12.135 --> 00:38:15.385
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

00:38:15.843 --> 00:38:18.427
All these questions will come to you.

00:38:18.926 --> 00:38:20.968
But if you have faith,

00:38:21.427 --> 00:38:23.801
not the blind but the enlightened

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.760
which is established by many miracles in life,

00:38:27.135 --> 00:38:28.260
many things in life;

00:38:28.634 --> 00:38:31.427
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.968
small, small things.

00:38:33.302 --> 00:38:35.385
There have been miracles even in big things,

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.510
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

00:38:39.926 --> 00:38:41.552
So now you know, very well settled,

00:38:41.968 --> 00:38:45.469
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:45.801 --> 00:38:48.552
For example, it starts raining.

00:38:49.052 --> 00:38:52.135
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

00:38:52.552 --> 00:38:55.177
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

00:38:55.552 --> 00:38:56.760
nothing can happen.

00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:59.302
Let it rain as much as it likes.

00:38:59.676 --> 00:39:03.427
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

00:39:03.843 --> 00:39:05.510
it’s not going to drench us.

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:11.010
In the same way this faith within us

00:39:11.385 --> 00:39:15.093
has to be absolutely solid,

00:39:15.843 --> 00:39:19.760
and that makes you extremely strong

00:39:20.218 --> 00:39:22.635
and makes you responsible

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.260
for the resurrection of thousands

00:39:25.594 --> 00:39:30.052
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

00:39:35.469 --> 00:39:39.469
This kind of life that we have

00:39:40.885 --> 00:39:46.552
– that only by our own establishment,

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.635
by our own understanding,

00:39:51.093 --> 00:39:56.676
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

00:39:57.718 --> 00:40:00.260
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

00:40:01.469 --> 00:40:04.843
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.427
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

00:40:09.926 --> 00:40:14.052
You all should have the chance

00:40:14.634 --> 00:40:18.218
to know your spirit

00:40:18.676 --> 00:40:22.843
and to know yourself.

00:40:23.634 --> 00:40:26.302
So one has to have faith in oneself.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.968
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:32.344
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

00:40:32.676 --> 00:40:36.718
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

00:40:39.968 --> 00:40:43.801
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:47.427
What do you want?

00:40:47.843 --> 00:40:52.093
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

00:40:54.052 --> 00:40:56.052
even if you don’t ask.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:02.010
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

00:41:02.594 --> 00:41:05.926
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

00:41:06.427 --> 00:41:08.968
because this all-pervading Power

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.093
is the only real power,

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.385
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

00:41:15.218 --> 00:41:21.968
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

00:41:22.635 --> 00:41:29.718
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

00:41:31.093 --> 00:41:34.385
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

00:41:34.801 --> 00:41:36.469
and he was deceived by someone

00:41:36.885 --> 00:41:39.302
and made him buy a land and a house

00:41:39.718 --> 00:41:43.634
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

00:41:44.093 --> 00:41:45.010
And this fellow said,

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:46.843
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

00:41:47.218 --> 00:41:48.926
they will not say anything to you.”

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.634
He believed him – had wrong faith,

00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:55.635
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

00:41:55.968 --> 00:42:01.510
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

00:42:03.634 --> 00:42:08.469
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.968
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

00:42:15.385 --> 00:42:18.302
and so many people came and saw all this.

00:42:18.718 --> 00:42:22.843
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.510
he could not understand,

00:42:24.926 --> 00:42:26.510
“Why it has happened to me

00:42:26.926 --> 00:42:30.885
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

00:42:32.676 --> 00:42:34.552
And he was deceived and he was,

00:42:35.218 --> 00:42:37.552
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

00:42:37.968 --> 00:42:41.718
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.552
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

00:42:45.926 --> 00:42:52.135
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:58.177
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

00:42:58.594 --> 00:43:01.676
That’s all – “Have faith.”

00:43:02.302 --> 00:43:04.385
And what a miraculous thing happened,

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.510
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

00:43:12.634 --> 00:43:14.469
And that fellow said,

00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:17.885
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

00:43:18.344 --> 00:43:21.302
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:25.552
that I want to pay.”

00:43:26.718 --> 00:43:31.843
It’s something unbelievable.

00:43:34.052 --> 00:43:37.469
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

00:43:37.843 --> 00:43:42.052
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

00:43:42.344 --> 00:43:45.177
Nothing worked out, nothing

00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:47.676
– only his faith.

00:43:48.135 --> 00:43:51.801
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

00:43:52.469 --> 00:43:53.760
He was supposed to go to jail,

00:43:54.135 --> 00:43:55.427
now he’s going to become a rich man.

00:43:55.801 --> 00:43:58.218
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

00:43:58.718 --> 00:44:00.218
This is just the financial side of it,

00:44:00.594 --> 00:44:01.427
but I know you know

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.676
that there are so many other miracles happening.

00:44:04.177 --> 00:44:08.302
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

00:44:08.718 --> 00:44:12.135
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

00:44:12.634 --> 00:44:16.218
After realization at least you should take to faith.

00:44:16.885 --> 00:44:19.552
That really is something surprising

00:44:19.885 --> 00:44:21.968
that people get their realization and everything,

00:44:22.427 --> 00:44:26.718
still they do not have faith in themselves.

00:44:27.302 --> 00:44:32.552
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

00:44:33.344 --> 00:44:37.926
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

00:44:38.302 --> 00:44:40.968
faith was part and parcel of His being.

00:44:41.469 --> 00:44:46.177
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

00:44:46.843 --> 00:44:49.760
Now we have to have it.

00:44:50.344 --> 00:44:54.010
We have to believe in ourselves.

00:44:54.676 --> 00:44:56.718
There’s so many incidents I can give you

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.594
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:04.010
where just the faith has helped.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.760
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.427
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:13.010
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:17.177
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

00:45:17.469 --> 00:45:19.634
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:21.260
She said it three times.

00:45:21.634 --> 00:45:23.594
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

00:45:23.926 --> 00:45:26.218
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

00:45:26.552 --> 00:45:28.302
She just got up, walked out.

00:45:28.676 --> 00:45:31.177
And then she started running all the way,

00:45:31.594 --> 00:45:33.552
and everybody started laughing.

00:45:33.885 --> 00:45:35.594
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

00:45:35.968 --> 00:45:38.218
I said, “But see her faith!”

00:45:38.885 --> 00:45:44.760
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

00:45:45.718 --> 00:45:52.093
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.801
They have shown faith in that person.

00:45:56.177 --> 00:45:57.635
As I have told you always,

00:45:57.968 --> 00:46:00.968
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

00:46:01.427 --> 00:46:03.052
One among hundred might deceive us

00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:04.843
doesn’t matter, we trust.

00:46:05.218 --> 00:46:08.968
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

00:46:09.385 --> 00:46:11.177
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

00:46:11.634 --> 00:46:14.469
But what about deities?

00:46:14.926 --> 00:46:17.801
You show faith in them and it works,

00:46:18.218 --> 00:46:19.552
immediately they work out.

00:46:19.968 --> 00:46:21.218
Like Guido told Me that

00:46:21.594 --> 00:46:24.344
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

00:46:24.843 --> 00:46:26.510
for these two days.”

00:46:26.926 --> 00:46:31.010
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.093
It disappeared.

00:46:35.552 --> 00:46:41.093
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:47.926
And when we talk of faith, you know,

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:54.218
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

00:46:55.344 --> 00:47:00.052
which organizes, which knows everything,

00:47:00.594 --> 00:47:02.676
which is so intelligent, efficient

00:47:03.093 --> 00:47:04.634
– above all, it loves you.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:08.093
And then you show faith.

00:47:09.635 --> 00:47:16.760
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:22.718
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

00:47:23.344 --> 00:47:24.635
They don’t feel then bad,

00:47:25.052 --> 00:47:27.760
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

00:47:28.135 --> 00:47:30.635
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:34.093
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:37.010
whether this thing happens or not.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.427
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

00:47:41.885 --> 00:47:43.093
Supposing you are lost on the way,

00:47:43.469 --> 00:47:46.760
know that it has to be that way.

00:47:47.594 --> 00:47:51.302
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

00:47:51.676 --> 00:47:53.218
He was to be crucified.

00:47:53.634 --> 00:47:55.052
He had to carry the cross,

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.010
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.427
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.302
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:08.676
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

00:48:09.218 --> 00:48:12.218
But this faith in Him gave Him

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:17.718
such a tremendous powers.

00:48:19.135 --> 00:48:20.843
He could have done anything.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.344
He could have killed all these people

00:48:23.635 --> 00:48:27.260
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

00:48:27.634 --> 00:48:29.594
Just one glance could have killed them.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:33.052
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

00:48:33.385 --> 00:48:34.594
He went through it.

00:48:34.926 --> 00:48:38.427
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:41.635
He is the one who won everything.

00:48:42.344 --> 00:48:44.177
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

00:48:44.552 --> 00:48:46.385
has to look at one’s own life.

00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:53.177
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

00:48:54.093 --> 00:48:58.218
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

00:48:58.718 --> 00:49:00.634
In the evolutionary process

00:49:01.052 --> 00:49:04.594
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

00:49:05.177 --> 00:49:11.427
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

00:49:11.926 --> 00:49:14.469
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:17.635
most of the people are not going to be there.

00:49:18.093 --> 00:49:19.552
Not that we are not available,

00:49:19.968 --> 00:49:25.634
but because they are not fated

00:49:26.218 --> 00:49:27.885
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:28.218 --> 00:49:30.510
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:32.427
So, you are so fortunate

00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:36.676
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

00:49:37.052 --> 00:49:40.052
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

00:49:40.469 --> 00:49:44.885
in your resurrection that is your being now.

00:49:45.385 --> 00:49:48.427
And with that you will know how precious

00:49:48.801 --> 00:49:51.594
you are for the whole world,

00:49:51.968 --> 00:49:54.093
and that what you have to do is not

00:49:54.427 --> 00:49:57.177
to think of material gains, physical gains

00:49:57.634 --> 00:50:02.885
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.302
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:10.843
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

00:50:11.218 --> 00:50:13.469
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

00:50:13.843 --> 00:50:14.926
everything works out,

00:50:15.427 --> 00:50:19.093
everything in its own time shows its own results.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:25.052
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

00:50:25.552 --> 00:50:30.594
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

00:50:33.635 --> 00:50:39.552
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

00:50:39.885 --> 00:50:41.385
“All right, Mother says so.

00:50:41.718 --> 00:50:44.926
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.177
Like the other day I had a journalist,

00:50:47.635 --> 00:50:50.594
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

00:50:50.968 --> 00:50:51.968
I said, “Why?”

00:50:52.302 --> 00:50:56.635
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

00:50:57.052 --> 00:50:59.010
How can there be a blind child,

00:50:59.302 --> 00:51:01.801
how can this and how can that?”

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.718
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.843
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:10.552
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:15.843
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

00:51:16.218 --> 00:51:20.718
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

00:51:22.218 --> 00:51:25.552
So the situation is explainable;

00:51:25.968 --> 00:51:30.427
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

00:51:31.135 --> 00:51:34.885
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

00:51:35.302 --> 00:51:37.177
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

00:51:37.635 --> 00:51:41.594
have you any problems? None.”

00:51:44.427 --> 00:51:46.635
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

00:51:47.052 --> 00:51:50.843
Now if you say that there is a way out

00:51:51.302 --> 00:51:54.302
and that there is a solution,

00:51:54.718 --> 00:51:57.760
and that a time can come

00:51:58.093 --> 00:52:01.010
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

00:52:01.427 --> 00:52:04.801
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

00:52:06.634 --> 00:52:08.302
so why not see this?

00:52:08.676 --> 00:52:12.385
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

00:52:13.676 --> 00:52:17.634
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:21.469
So this kind of negative attitude

00:52:21.843 --> 00:52:23.968
also Sahaja yogis can have.

00:52:24.427 --> 00:52:26.676
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

00:52:27.135 --> 00:52:29.634
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

00:52:29.926 --> 00:52:33.177
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

00:52:33.718 --> 00:52:38.177
You can cure, your faith can cure.

00:52:38.676 --> 00:52:41.510
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

00:52:41.885 --> 00:52:43.135
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

00:52:43.634 --> 00:52:47.260
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

00:52:47.634 --> 00:52:49.885
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

00:52:50.385 --> 00:52:54.801
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

00:52:55.218 --> 00:52:58.010
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

00:52:58.469 --> 00:53:01.218
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

00:53:01.552 --> 00:53:03.718
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

00:53:04.135 --> 00:53:05.594
Third day he was out of hospital,

00:53:05.843 --> 00:53:08.052
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

00:53:08.469 --> 00:53:12.052
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

00:53:12.469 --> 00:53:14.676
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

00:53:15.052 --> 00:53:17.344
the deities have to work it out.

00:53:17.801 --> 00:53:20.968
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:24.344
It’s the deities who stood by it.

00:53:28.302 --> 00:53:34.760
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

00:53:35.552 --> 00:53:41.552
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:45.801
Why not we develop that complete faith

00:53:46.302 --> 00:53:48.177
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

00:53:48.594 --> 00:53:51.552
we are in the Kingdom of God,

00:53:52.052 --> 00:53:56.302
and that this Power is going to look after us?

00:53:56.843 --> 00:53:59.427
Then we’ll have no choices,

00:53:59.885 --> 00:54:05.760
we’ll have no hesitation.

00:54:06.635 --> 00:54:10.177
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

00:54:10.594 --> 00:54:13.052
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

00:54:13.469 --> 00:54:15.634
or go anywhere – so what?

00:54:16.093 --> 00:54:19.302
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

00:54:19.676 --> 00:54:22.302
it’s perfectly all right.

00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:25.218
And no worry of any kind.

00:54:25.635 --> 00:54:28.177
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:30.926
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

00:54:31.302 --> 00:54:33.052
Everything drops out.

00:54:33.469 --> 00:54:34.760
Doesn’t matter.

00:54:35.177 --> 00:54:38.052
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:42.302
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.718
Like people tell Me,

00:54:44.052 --> 00:54:45.427
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.552
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

00:54:48.801 --> 00:54:51.385
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

00:54:51.843 --> 00:54:52.968
only the seat is changed.

00:54:53.385 --> 00:54:55.635
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:00.760
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

00:55:02.218 --> 00:55:08.344
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

00:55:08.885 --> 00:55:11.427
then you don’t bother.

00:55:11.885 --> 00:55:14.344
Many people will find out whether

00:55:14.676 --> 00:55:17.093
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

00:55:17.469 --> 00:55:22.010
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:26.926
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

00:55:27.344 --> 00:55:30.968
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

00:55:31.469 --> 00:55:34.344
Nothing can bind you,

00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:36.552
nothing can pull you down,

00:55:36.885 --> 00:55:40.718
no habit can come back on you;

00:55:42.718 --> 00:55:48.010
because faith will purify you completely,

00:55:48.594 --> 00:55:51.635
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

00:55:52.135 --> 00:55:55.926
This faith is not something

00:55:56.385 --> 00:55:58.010
that can be put into your heads

00:55:58.427 --> 00:56:02.010
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

00:56:02.718 --> 00:56:07.552
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:13.260
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:13.885 --> 00:56:18.469
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

00:56:19.594 --> 00:56:21.594
would be established,

00:56:22.052 --> 00:56:23.760
would be effective,

00:56:24.177 --> 00:56:29.552
and for the whole world will be a model.

00:56:31.135 --> 00:56:34.718
May God bless you all.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.010
There are just the children, there are so many children.

00:57:15.093 --> 00:57:16.594
Today is the day of Christ,

00:57:16.885 --> 00:57:21.052
so we should have children in any case to wash My feet.

00:57:22.843 --> 00:57:27.344
Can you fit it there, or you will have to move it?
