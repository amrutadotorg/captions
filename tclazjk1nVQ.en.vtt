00:15.955 --> 00:19.115
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:43.088 --> 00:46.928
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

00:49.430 --> 01:00.460
many of you are wondering why God has created these beautiful things.

01:00.540 --> 01:04.380
Because you people had to come on this Earth

01:04.460 --> 01:08.266
and enjoy the beauty that is one of the reasons.

01:08.346 --> 01:14.542
And now God feels very much fulfilled

01:14.622 --> 01:29.588
with the joy and satisfaction and a kind of a completion of His desire.

01:29.669 --> 01:38.970
Why God has created this beautiful universe
has been a question

01:39.050 --> 01:42.755
asked for thousands of years.

01:44.961 --> 01:51.028
The reason is very simple to understand:

01:51.108 --> 01:58.414
this beauty that is created cannot see itself.

01:58.615 --> 02:08.865
In the same way, God who is the source
of beauty, cannot see its own beauty,

02:08.945 --> 02:13.879
like a pearl cannot enter into itself to see its beauty,

02:13.960 --> 02:20.367
like the sky cannot understand its own beauty,

02:20.447 --> 02:25.666
the stars cannot see their own beauty,

02:25.746 --> 02:37.624
the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance.

02:37.705 --> 02:47.513
In the same way God Almighty cannot behold His own being.

02:47.593 --> 02:50.843
He needs a mirror

02:50.923 --> 02:58.787
and that is how He has created this
beautiful universe as His mirror.

02:58.867 --> 03:05.334
In this mirror He has created now beautiful things like the Sun,

03:05.414 --> 03:12.232
then the Sun has to see his own reflection also.

03:13.673 --> 03:19.382
So, he has created these beautiful trees to see that

03:19.462 --> 03:26.954
when he shines, they come up so well and look so green.

03:27.034 --> 03:32.158
Then He has created those birds to rise early in the morning

03:32.238 --> 03:39.505
to greet the Sun, so the Sun knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

03:39.585 --> 03:45.475
or else He has created these beautiful lakes
for these trees to see their reflection

03:45.661 --> 03:52.215
and the lakes to feel their existence when the
ripples start moving within themselves.

03:52.395 --> 03:55.865
So then He created human beings.

03:55.945 --> 04:00.794
The human beings cannot also see their own beauty, their own glory.

04:00.874 --> 04:05.025
That is why they are in the darkness, they are ignorant.

04:05.105 --> 04:10.568
They cannot see what lies within themselves.

04:10.648 --> 04:17.924
So they are running after something
which is absolutely against themselves,

04:18.005 --> 04:24.237
which is ugliness, which is self destructive.

04:24.336 --> 04:30.164
And the struggle to get to is such a lot,

04:30.244 --> 04:33.619
that as a result, they destroy themselves.

04:33.700 --> 04:39.087
Like as people have taken to these drugs, taken to all bad
habits

04:39.167 --> 04:42.585
– of in this place, they say a lot of smuggling going on –

04:42.665 --> 04:47.856
and all such endeavors that people take up because they do not know

04:47.936 --> 04:50.495
what beautiful things they are.

04:50.575 --> 04:56.692
So now a mirror has to be created for them,
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

04:56.773 --> 05:00.826
Their mirror is their Spirit.

05:00.906 --> 05:06.073
That Spirit is to be brought in their consciousness, their attention.

05:06.153 --> 05:11.482
If it comes in their attention then they can see their image.

05:11.575 --> 05:21.583
Now this attention that comes in as an enlightened attention

05:21.663 --> 05:27.635
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

05:27.715 --> 05:33.597
is the expression of the attention which is enlightened.

05:33.677 --> 05:40.819
But it is also said that it is got a nature, which is very transitory,

05:40.899 --> 05:46.811
or, we can say, which is disappearing every moment to moment.

05:46.891 --> 05:50.916
When
this is happening what is to be done?

05:50.996 --> 05:57.051
For that you have to steady yourself with meditation,

05:57.131 --> 06:02.790
with hearing the enlightened talks,

06:02.870 --> 06:11.745
by seeing the good things of life without thinking about them,

06:11.825 --> 06:16.507
by seeing also the goodness of others

06:16.587 --> 06:20.789
and then you start seeing
goodness in yourself also.

06:20.869 --> 06:24.645
That is why I always say that one should not feel guilty.

06:24.725 --> 06:32.977
Because you are feeling guilty of something, which is just, just an illusion.

06:33.071 --> 06:38.002
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. It is something like that.

06:38.082 --> 06:41.677
So if you know that you are beautiful beings

06:41.757 --> 06:47.525
and that you have got a shadow is nothing to do with you and your beauty.

06:47.605 --> 06:54.134
If you can see you own beauty then you will be amazed that within us lies

06:54.215 --> 07:00.403
all those joy giving, all those beautiful
things, which we are seeing outside.

07:00.483 --> 07:03.083
But just now, the mirror is not all right,

07:03.163 --> 07:06.371
that’s
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

07:06.452 --> 07:16.779
But, when you are one with your Self, then
you see all these nature within yourself,

07:16.860 --> 07:20.515
all the joy giving qualities of this nature within yourself.

07:20.595 --> 07:27.075
So I wanted you to come to this place just
to learn how God has created this beautiful

07:28.501 --> 07:33.682
area for you people to enjoy and to be here.

07:33.762 --> 07:35.895
May God bless you.
