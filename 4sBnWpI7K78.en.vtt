00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.709
hello! It’s good! How are you?

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:06.709
It’s a good day.

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:08.890
Today is an auspicious day because 21st is
an auspicious day for us and today is Monday

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.890
and the 7th month.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:39.860
All things combined together and it’s a
very auspicious evening.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:01:20.990
So today I’ll talk to you about auspiciousness
because most of you are Sahaj Yogis.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:34.759
Who has come for the first time?

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.980
One, two, three, four, five…So we have for
the first time! All right.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.980
(laughing)

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:51.620
I am sure somebody has talked to them about
introduction to Sahaja Yoga or something?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.010
And to make it short, the whole thing I don’t
want to repeat as I was thinking of talking

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.570
on a new subject to the Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.970
As you know all of you, and you can see around
also that there’s a very big en masse search

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.979
for the Truth — there is.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:15.170
I mean, even in this hall you will be amazed
there might be five [or] six halls like this

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.810
where everybody is sitting in some hall and
doing and something about it.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.780
I mean there is no doubt a very big urge to
seek the Truth.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:39.000
This urge has come through our own evolutionary
understanding.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.209
When human beings have reached a certain stage
of sagacity, you can call it, or a satisfaction,

00:02:51.209 --> 00:03:02.379
like when you have achieved a certain amount
of material well-being or have seen something

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:23.219
which doesn’t give you a complete answer;
like Buddha, when he saw an old man and then

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:33.209
a dead man, he was puzzled at it; he was very
much puzzled and he started wondering what

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.309
is this death and why a human being becomes
an old man.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:53.059
There was a prophecy about him when he was
a child that he may become an ascetic or that

00:03:53.059 --> 00:04:02.999
he may give up his family life to find the
Truth — he might do that.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:07.810
And the parents were worried and [his] father
arranged for him a very big palace with all

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.449
the things available and a very beautiful
wife and a child.

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:22.760
But still from inside he had a feeling of
some incompleteness, of meaningless[ness]

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:34.300
of life; and with that meaningless feeling,
once he saw a very, very old man and then

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.780
a dead man, and this just went into his head.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.669
This was two thousand years back, more than
that.

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.380
But today there was many buddhas living.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.550
I mean his first name was Siddharth.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.590
Siddharth itself is very beautiful [name]
– Siddh, Arth: the one who has mastered

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.659
his meaning.

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.349
The beginning of the name itself was very
suggestive.

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.080
But then he became The Buddha, the enlightened
one.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.460
But you are all siddharthas who are seeking
the Truth.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.889
he also went to Upanishadas and he also went
to many people, he went to Benares and was

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.740
so disillusioned the way the people were in
Benares.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.680
he found there was no religion in them, there
was no God in them, there was no goodness

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
in them.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.060
And they were making money out of all this.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.150
Then he went to some gurus, and this and that,
and everywhere he found that they did not

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.879
know the Truth, and he got tired, very tired.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:06:00.760
he had given up everything just in the search
of Truth.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.430
And he was so tired, absolutely tired, and
lay down under a tree, a banyan tree, we call

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.430
it the ashwatha: and then Sahaja Yoga itself,
[which] is the spontaneous awakening of the

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.449
Kundalini, took place, and he got his Realisation.

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:24.940
But that time there was no Mataji Nirmala
Devi to tell him how he got it, where was

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.770
his Kundalini.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:38.169
he just felt the cool breeze coming in him
and he felt his Self and he started talking

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.190
about it and telling people.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:52.740
he felt that, “Because I gave up everything,
that is why it has worked so."

00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:11.819
It was a mistake, I would say, or a misunderstanding,
because what do you give up?

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.820
Whatever you hold on to.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.190
What is there to give up?

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.819
All these stones?

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:19.819
What?

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:21.539
What is their value?

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:29.590
And this giving up is also a mental idea,
just a mental idea: if you are not holding

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.349
on to anything what are you going to give
up?

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:42.990
So this idea of giving up came to him because
he thought that this must be the reason.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:51.860
Supposing I have to come to Caxton Hall, I
go all the way to Tottenham Court Road and

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.160
then I go to East End and then come down here.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.990
So if anybody comes to ask me the way I will
say, “All right, go to Tottenham Court Road,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:07.509
then to East End and then through the traffic
you can land up here!” But it’s only two

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:15.840
minutes drive from my house! So it was that
kind of a misunderstanding which led him to

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.139
think that there is no God.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:23.120
In a way it was a mid-step because if you
talk of God suddenly…Even today if I say,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.110
“There is a God,” how are you to believe
me?

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.199
You can believe your vibrations, you can believe
there’s a cool breeze coming in, you can

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:35.880
see the Kundalini rising, you can see the
pulsation of that, but how can you say that

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.180
there is God?

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.519
Because I say there is.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.649
Because it is pervading.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:52.820
And whatever I say, now you can test it on
your vibrations!

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.269
Now how will you know that these vibrations
are telling you the Truth?

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:04.020
It is very simple if you understand the common
sense of relativity.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:13.560
Like, bring two mad people from lunatic asylum
absolutely certified as mad — all right?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:22.050
And then – Paul is laughing – and then
get two sane people sitting down.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:27.440
Now you put your hands towards the people
who are mad and you will get horrible burning

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:35.560
in here, maybe in here, maybe in the whole
hand — on the left side.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.459
And they themselves, before my photograph
will be going on like this (shaking).

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:46.870
Many go, even they look sane but there are
many like that: all fanatics, all extremists,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:59.350
all sorts of people, they go on like this,
spiritualists again, druggists, chemists (laughing),

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.350
cancer patients.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:09.490
It’s a different frequency, different style
in every way.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:15.399
So you get ten cases like that.

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:27.720
Now you ask the question, “Is there God?”
And you start getting cool breeze flowing

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.810
into you.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:35.889
“Is His power all-pervading?” You start
getting a cool breeze flowing into you.

00:10:35.889 --> 00:10:45.050
That is how you find out which is the Truth,
where what I am saying, what vibrations are

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.100
telling, is the Truth or not.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.220
That is how you can test your vibrations.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:00.290
This search is on, and there are many shops
people have opened.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.220
This is not a shop, this is a temple.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:14.269
And a temple in the market place has a very
little value.

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:20.699
If you have to climb up seven mountains to
go to a temple it has much more value but

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:29.940
only a few can reach there alive! So the temple
had to come down to London, to Caxton Hall,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.820
to talk to people.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:40.009
But in the market place if you have a temple,
you can notice that people just go in the

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:45.089
marketplace, purchase something before going
they may throw 1 anna (1/16 old Indian Rupee)

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:49.171
there thinking, “Oh Lord, give me some profit
when I am going there!” And while coming

00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:53.920
back they will throw another 5 annas there
saying that, “Oh all right, You have helped

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.920
me.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.170
All right 5p is all right for your sake because
I have got some profit I am giving You!”

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:06.019
Because they have a mentality of marketing:
even with God they bargain.

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:13.130
The mentality is of marketing, of most of
the people, must be.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.759
But among them are real people also.

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:21.700
Many, many real people are there who are misled.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:31.009
Because they see the crowds going, thousands
of people going there, they are also misled.

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:37.620
Ultimately all those who are true seekers
will receive their Realisation.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.440
Even those who are not will receive it.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.370
But first those who are seeking are the foundation
stones.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:52.519
They have to build up themselves in such a
way that this big edifice could be raised

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:57.660
on its back, on its foundation stone.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:10.649
You people have to be such strong Sahaja Yogis,
such strong Sahaja Yogis, that from your own

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:20.000
life others would take the lessons and understand
that this is something that has really transformed

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
people.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.990
Because the time of judgment has come and
of transformation.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:32.790
The Last Judgement is not direct but through
transformation.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.529
It does not fail much.

00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:43.010
If you do not fail it, it is not going to
fail: it is going to work out.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:49.779
All sorts of permutations and combinations
it has worked out — all sorts.

00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:53.910
Now there’s no horrible guru I have not
tried.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.680
Of course, sometimes I hear some new names
from somebody.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.379
The other day I heard something new, some
other name.

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:05.139
And he’s another funny thing! He’s teaching
people, I don’t know.

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:07.769
Something very horrid he’s teaching people.

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:14.470
And maybe he may be successful for a short
time but ultimately those who are true seekers

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.740
will definitely come.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:21.100
Those who are supporting these wrong organisations
will also come to Sahaja Yoga because they

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.940
will recognise that, “By supporting these
people what are we going to gain?

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:31.380
We are going to go to hell!” They will see
their gurus how they are behaving: ultimately

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.380
they will come of course.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.970
For the time being they do not.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.899
Sometimes it’s quite frustrating.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:41.850
For example, in Norwich we met two ladies
— elderly, quite elderly — but without

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:48.050
any common sense and they said, “No, we
have a guru who has given us a name."

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.009
I said, “Why do you need a guru for that?

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:53.300
You can pick up on the streets.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.829
A donkey can give you a name!”And what is
the name they have been given?

00:14:55.829 --> 00:15:00.589
One of the disciples of this guru told me
a name has been given called as ‘tinga’

00:15:00.589 --> 00:15:05.079
[which] means ‘a thumb’ — [in India
if] you show somebody a thumb, it is ‘tinga’.

00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:11.540
Just imagine! It is not even Sanskrit! I said,
“He doesn’t even know Sanskrit! Now he

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:17.850
has been found out with six women around him
and he’s got keeps and he’s taking all

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.100
Scotch whisky, all that, he’s busy here."

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.750
They said, “Still…” I said, “Still?

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:36.079
How long will you go on like that?” Of course
some common sense will come into them.

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:42.399
So these things are there, existing, but the
true ones will understand the true nature

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:43.889
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:51.110
It is so nice to see all of you here because
we are going to have a very nice 27th.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:57.410
Is the day we are initiating you as gurus;
that’s the day you will be initiated as

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.410
gurus.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.560
And special powers will be given to you on
that day.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:19.339
But our intellect is to be a little bit brought
low and our heart is to be a little bit raised

00:16:19.339 --> 00:16:20.339
higher.

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:27.379
If we could do that then we’ll be able to
create auspiciousness about us.

00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:30.269
Now I must tell you about auspiciousness.

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:32.759
What is auspicious?

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:39.569
This word people know: this is not auspicious,
that is not auspicious.

00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:44.350
If you find the horse’s horseshoe, it is
auspicious.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:54.730
Now do you know in modern times the symbol
of Sahaja Yoga is horseshoe-shaped: can you

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:55.730
imagine?

00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.440
It has many meanings but why that shape is
auspicious, people did not know.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:06.430
People do not know why a thing is auspicious
and a thing is not auspicious.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:14.270
Now this has been in England; for years people
were using horseshoe as an auspicious thing

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.100
and it is, hundred percent.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.280
The shape of a horseshoe emits vibrations.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280
You can see for yourself.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:32.130
The shape of that horseshoe is the shape [of]
how The Shakti moves, how the power moves:

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.110
always like this, elliptical, like that.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:45.301
It goes to a person, say if I love this person
the vibrations will go like this and embrace

00:17:45.301 --> 00:17:46.560
her and then come back.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.650
The first movement is this way, the first
dimension is like that.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:54.910
But this can be [in] three-hundred and sixty
degrees (3600) it moves.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.300
The whole Creation took place by the movement
of the Shakti like this.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.710
That’s why they sometimes see it parabolic.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.240
You see, like Einstein has been talking about
it.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.450
But they see partial truth, not the whole.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:26.060
Now, when you have a shape or a form, or a
kind of an assemblage of certain factors in

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:37.300
a particular material could be, could be a
particular tree, could be a human being, then

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:47.240
you find, from that person — only the realised-souls
can feel — vibrations coming.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:56.370
Because, whatever emits vibration is auspicious
and auspiciousness is the quality by which

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.180
we emit vibrations.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:07.310
Now purity is
a very relative word in the modern times.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.610
People don’t understand what is purity.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.250
I mean they don’t understand even what is
normal, leave only purity.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:17.160
Everybody seems to be abnormal or subnormal
in modern times.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.210
Nobody seems to be normal.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.912
Even the psychologists can’t define what
normal is.

00:19:19.912 --> 00:19:22.770
Normal is that which is auspicious.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:30.760
Now this is the knowledge of the beyond.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.790
With whatever senses you have, you cannot
feel it.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.510
For example, I went to Stonehenge.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.730
Now you all know that there’s something
about Stonehenge, you know that there’s

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:43.750
something about them.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.810
But what about them?

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:54.520
These are the stones which have come out of
Mother Earth, which are emitting vibrations.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.820
And the covering of that has been done later
on, some people must have [done that].

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.370
They did not understand how these stones have
come out, one after another so they must have

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.520
used [other stones] to cover it.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:12.360
But if they were saints they would have said
that, this is a stone which has got vibrations.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:22.020
For example, when we say that we should not
worship any statues in The Bible, it’s very

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:29.080
correct because it is said that, whatever
is created by Mother Earth or by the sky should

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.410
not be reproduced.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.280
So Mother Earth is producing something.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.120
Now ask the Christians what are they producing.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.830
What is the element that is the earth is producing,
what is the sky is producing?

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:50.130
They will not be able to tell you! What is
this Mother Earth producing which should not

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.250
be reproduced?

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.900
Which should not be worshipped?

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:59.150
Means something She is producing which should
be worshipped and that should not be reproduced.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:08.771
This auspiciousness can only be felt by people
who are realised-souls or people who are sensitive

00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:11.030
to spirituality.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.920
Those who are not sensitive to spirituality
cannot feel it.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.020
They do not understand.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:24.090
They may like a person very much, “Because
I like!” But why?

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:29.820
Why do you like a person very much and you
do not like another person?

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:36.300
That person may be any type, they will say,
“No we like him!” But children — not

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.710
all, but many children — can feel the auspiciousness.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:48.980
Dogs can feel it, rats can feel it, snakes
can feel it, tigers can feel it, lions can

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:56.150
feel it, but human beings are rather difficult!
Horses can feel it.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.910
Horses feel it very much.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:10.620
If you take them near a place where there
are [dead] spirits or, we can say, some sort

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.640
of a burial ground, they would not like to
go down there much.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:23.560
First they would resist, but gradually they
also get used to it; same with dogs.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.780
They can feel it, a man who is a realised-soul,
who is not a realised-soul.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.930
They can even feel an evil person.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.850
They are very sensitive.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:39.410
A dog can always feel a saint.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.920
Even a mad dog can be controlled by a saint.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:53.720
This auspiciousness, the feeling of auspiciousness,
can be felt through heart: it’s the feeling

00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:02.970
from the heart, not from the brain, not from
the ego or superego: means either we get ideas

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:07.960
from our ego or from our superego, from our
conditioning.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:17.370
But if our heart is alive, which is a very
rare thing nowadays: most of us have got hearts

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:25.700
like, ‘frozen’ I would not say [but],
like Rock of Gibraltar.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.510
Because frozen can be defrosted.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:34.550
So such a heart, Rock of Gibraltar, is living
here, you see.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:43.990
And you meet another person and you feel the
other is just going to bang on you with that

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.990
Rock of Gibraltar.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.660
I don’t know if you have visited Rock of
Gibraltar any time.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.660
I have.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:56.590
One day we were plying on a ship and suddenly
our ship stopped and what I found is a huge

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.220
big promontory.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:04.060
I said, “What sort of a thing it is?”
Because no ship can go near any rock, that

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:12.160
near, because no rock is that steep to give
that much draft for the ship.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.800
And this was just like this in front.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.490
I said, “What sort of a rock is this?”
They said, “This is Rock of Gibraltar!”

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:25.620
I was looking at it absolutely a solid piece
and you thought it is going to hit you on

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.680
your head.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:33.600
Something like that [when] human beings become,
how can you feel the auspiciousness?

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.660
It’s a very sensitive thing: extremely sensitive
and delicate.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:45.600
All the delicacy of the heart, I don’t know
where it is gone.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.880
Like Lord Byron’s style! Look at him: what
a life he had! He made everyone miserable

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.570
in his private life and in his poetry he made
everybody cry; took out their eyes, washed

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:13.500
them, again put them back in the sockets!
(laughing) I mean, he was a very great sadist,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.500
I felt.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.830
Horrible! He could not write anything beautiful,
he could not see anything beautiful, he could

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.710
not say anything that was pleasant.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:30.830
And people, I have seen, have wept and wept
and wept and this fellow was enjoying having

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.420
a nice time somewhere! (laughing)

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:40.130
It’s nice to laugh it out because we had
two patients who read only Lord Byron and

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:49.870
were gone cases! You don’t know in England
I get such cases, some samples! He is no more

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.210
here so I can tell you about him.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.690
He used to just weep and weep and weep.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.110
And then we didn’t do anything with him
here, we couldn’t do much.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:04.290
I told him, “Why are you weeping?” And
then I discovered he was a patient created

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:13.600
by Lord Byron! I told him not to take this
poet very seriously, and forget about it!

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.640
(laughing) He was just doing it to sell his
books! But the fellow couldn’t get rid of

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.180
it, always he used to get into that mood,
and very serious mood and this and that.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.520
Then we sent him home.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.760
I sent some Sahaja Yogis to his mother, father:
very nice people, I must say.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.900
They talked to me on the phone: very good
people.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.130
They said, “Mother, if you say, we’ll
keep him in the house."

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:38.830
He’s a big man, he’s a big man about thirty
years of age, you know.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:43.430
And third day the mother said, “Better chuck
him out of the house, Mother!” I said, “Why,

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.960
where will he go?” She said, “He is still
doing the same thing.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.020
He is in the room.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.760
I have to serve him food.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:59.500
I have to wash his things and he is just sitting
and weeping there!” So because the sensitivity

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500
is lost.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.500
Whom are you giving your heart?

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:08.650
To this Lord Byron, of all the persons?

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.610
This is the problem with us: we do not know
who is auspicious.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.450
For example, Blake people won’t like.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:22.820
I mean the one who is the poet you have really,
I would say, after Shakespeare.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.190
I wonder if Shakespeare was one man or many
people put together.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:31.860
But Blake was the poet you had, the greatest
of all I would say.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.110
There were so many, also others.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.290
Wordsworth was another.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:40.360
You can see [that] those who talk of charming
things or pleasant things and beautiful things

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.860
are the poets, not these garbage cleaners.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:57.730
What is wrong with us that we cannot make
out between the stink and the fragrance?

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.910
Auspiciousness is the way we emit our fragrance
to others.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:07.750
For example the other day two boys got Realisation
and all the Sahaja Yogis ran just to feel

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.980
their vibrations and the rest were left behind.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.510
Because they were enjoying the person, the
vibrations of that person.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.460
Then I shouted at them, I said, “Now, all
right, now you have enjoyed, now go and see

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.100
others also there!” And they would not go
near somebody who was thinking he was a great

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.960
man sitting down there.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.130
Nobody would go near them.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.160
They were holding their ears sitting here.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.540
Then everybody avoiding to go to that man
and the fellow must be feeling miserable,

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.460
I know that, but I went to him and worked
it out.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.960
But then I found that he was doing something
very, very wrong himself.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.750
And he said, “Mother, I am not evil."

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:47.530
I said, “No, it’s not evil but whatever
you have done is evil, is to play into the

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.200
spirits, call them down, put on people and
this.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.730
Is an evil thing to do."

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.790
“I did not know, Mother."

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.960
I said, “All right.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.450
It’s all right, if you did not know, it
can be forgiven."

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:03.980
But this is what auspiciousness is: that you
to feel it from your heart which is awakened.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.030
The heart must be awakened.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:18.850
In the heart resides the Spirit, which is
not yet flowing in our consciousness, in our

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.420
central nervous system.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:27.810
It resides there, the joy itself.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:33.730
I don’t know if you have ever seen phosphorus
taken out of the water and how it just gets

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:38.540
ignited, it is like that.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:46.510
Inside the maya, the illusion, that spark
is sitting down, and when this Kundalini rises

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:52.870
and touches that spark, it starts emitting
its joy, its auspiciousness.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:30:00.570
Unless and until you have that within you,
you cannot feel the auspiciousness of others.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:09.240
Take a coconut, for example: put it the other
way round, you won’t get vibrations.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:15.610
If you put it this way [with] the coconut
coming up you will get more vibrations.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:24.600
There are certain coconuts who give you very
good vibrations, some give horrible ones.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:34.040
And you know human beings also have coconuts!
(laughter) Some of the coconuts give such

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.820
beautiful vibrations and some of them do not.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.200
Some of them are tired.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:47.310
Some of them are nothing but like a balloon
of Mr.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.020
Ego.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.830
Or some of them have nothing but superego
in them.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:58.320
So this coconut is to be made auspicious.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:09.130
Now, how it is connected to the Spirit, that
is a very important point: how our brain is

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:10.800
connected with Spirit.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:17.960
Whatever I am telling you, you need not believe
me but, you will find it out for yourself

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.920
that, whatever I am saying is the Truth.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:34.530
Your heart has the Spirit, the light, and
the heart has got seven auras around it.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:46.610
And these seven auras get enlightened by the
Spirit.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:54.430
But before that it’s a very instantaneous
or you can say a simultaneous happening.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:32:02.501
When the Kundalini rises there are seven centres
also in our brain, in the sense [that] there

00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:04.740
are the seats of the centres.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.750
These seven centres are represented again
on the seat, you know that very well.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:14.660
All the Sahaja Yogis know where they are.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:26.630
So when these centres are enlightened, the
auras start shining in the heart.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:32.230
And this centre (brahmarandhra) is actually
the seat of the Spirit.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.490
The Spirit has moved from there and has gone
to the heart: that’s why in childhood you

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:40.000
will find there’s an opening here.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.150
It’s a very soft bone, called as fontanelle
bone, talu, is here.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:52.060
Because the Spirit comes out from there and
is settled on the heart.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:57.810
You know, Spirit also comes out in the night
sometimes, goes round and sees.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.080
It’s so.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:09.370
When these centres in our brain get enlightened
by Kundalini, one by one, first they are enlightened

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:16.140
here, then in the brain, then the auras in
the heart start getting enlightened.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:26.110
Ultimately when this centre — which is the
centre of the heart here, Sahastrara, in this

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:40.750
point — when this one gets enlightened,
then the Spirit also gets enlightened, fully;

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:48.350
and then these auras become doubly shining.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:55.740
Then the auspiciousness is in many dimensions
starts expressing itself.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:04.370
But to keep that light on, one has to keep
the Kundalini over here.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:09.109
Then what happens?

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:14.210
Then we are ruled by our heart’s indication
[rather] than by our brain.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.210
How?

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:24.759
Because the heart has the Spirit, which emits
vibrations, it’s not the brain.

00:34:24.759 --> 00:34:28.609
And you depend on your vibratory awareness
after Realisation.

00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:34.409
The more you depend on your vibratory awareness,
the more you use your heart, your Spirit,

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.669
not your brain.

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:41.020
The more you use your brain: again you go
down.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:47.240
Because it is taken over now by the Spirit.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.429
For example: after Realisation when you start
thinking about it…I mean people can think

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:54.799
of anything! I mean I can tell you, I have
had such experiences that they would think

00:34:54.799 --> 00:35:00.920
that, “Why Mataji is wearing a sari like
this?” Even to this extent they can go to!

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.140
But if you can just leave your heart to work
it out and don’t think, because you are

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.140
in thoughtless awareness after Realisation.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:13.809
If you try to maintain that state, pay attention
to your heart and let your Spirit emit itself

00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:20.880
so that it clears out completely the confusion
of the brain and everything; then you will

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.539
be amazed that you cannot lose your vibrations.

00:35:25.539 --> 00:35:26.539
You cannot lose your Realisation.

00:35:26.539 --> 00:35:36.420
The simplest way is — we have found like
this — that after Realisation if you go

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:41.299
for seven days treatment with soaking feet
before my photograph it works out.

00:35:41.299 --> 00:35:48.160
But immediately when I say, “My photograph,”:
finished! The ego comes up: “Why her photograph?”

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:54.490
First thing comes up: “Who is She?” I
may be nothing — all right agreed, I am

00:35:54.490 --> 00:36:01.779
nothing — but I have raised your Kundalini!I
have given you Realisation! I must be something

00:36:01.779 --> 00:36:06.859
after all.

00:36:06.859 --> 00:36:07.859
So why worry?

00:36:07.859 --> 00:36:12.789
I am not taking away anything from you.

00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:18.940
Then you start establishing your auspiciousness,
the sense of auspiciousness.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:25.210
Once you have established it, then you do
not lose it very easily.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.210
You don’t like then inauspicious things,
normally.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:34.359
If there is somebody inauspicious you say,
“Mother, no! We can’t do anything about

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:40.069
this gentleman!” Afterwards when you become
very strong you don’t mind working on anyone

00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:42.059
whatsoever.

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:43.869
But gradually you have to grow up to it.

00:36:43.869 --> 00:36:45.070
I understand that.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:50.019
But I can’t understand people using their
rationality to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:50.019 --> 00:36:59.900
How can you understand this Great Power with
your limited rationality?

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:13.510
I can explain to an ant about your politics
but I cannot tell you how this Divine Power

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:14.779
works.

00:37:14.779 --> 00:37:27.990
One day Djamel asked me, numerically: to what
extent it goes, to what dimension?

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.099
And when I told him he said, “It is incalculable."

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:34.450
I said, “It is infinite! You cannot calculate."

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:42.630
If you put two mirrors facing each other and
put some object in between, you cannot calculate

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:50.500
how many reflections you will get.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.770
Even that you see but you cannot calculate.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:38:02.580
But here I am talking about something that
does that, which creates this.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:10.099
You cannot calculate all the molecules and
the atoms of one element, but I am talking

00:38:10.099 --> 00:38:20.309
about Somebody who has created them and who,
in every molecule, pulsates.

00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:24.519
How can you understand with this brain?

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:26.660
You can only become one with It and enjoy
yourself! Why worry?

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:32.230
Why do you want to count the molecules?

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:39.730
Why this madness?

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:49.789
It would be like a madman going to the seashore
to have a nice bath, starts counting the small

00:38:49.789 --> 00:38:55.650
little pebbles and the grains of the sand.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:01.970
Get in! Enjoy! You become that.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:05.089
This is advaita, were you become one.

00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:08.210
All religions teach advaita.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:16.059
Advait means were there is not the other,
ananya.

00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:17.900
You become one with that.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:18.930
With the whole Ocean you become one.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:23.269
[When] a drop becomes the ocean, all the powers
of the oceans are there for the drop — that’s

00:39:23.269 --> 00:39:24.269
what it is.

00:39:24.269 --> 00:39:32.200
But there are some people, who say, “We
believe in dwaita, No, we don’t want to

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.200
get lost."

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.630
You are not lost! You become the whole.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:42.490
But they want to keep their small limitations,
you see.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:47.480
Now what is that small limitation they want
to keep?

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:53.359
It’s called as Mr.

00:39:53.359 --> 00:40:02.970
E G O, which is a myth, which is a myth.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:09.240
It’s such a big myth is ego: because what
do you do, human beings?

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.589
Let’s see now.

00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:12.570
What do you do?

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:13.760
You make a chair all right.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.730
You see, people are even proud if they can
make a chair these days because nobody can

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:23.069
use their hands these days, you know that,
with everything done by machines.

00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:28.100
I don’t know they cannot create human beings
otherwise they may try that also.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.799
So what do you do?

00:40:32.799 --> 00:40:35.950
You create something dead out of dead.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.339
Everything is dead.

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:42.269
Whatever you have created is dead.

00:40:42.269 --> 00:40:43.289
Have you done any living work?

00:40:43.289 --> 00:40:45.130
So one lady got very angry with me.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:49.930
She said, “Yes, we have created a tube baby!”
I said, “You have not created, it was all

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:50.930
there.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:51.930
The life was there.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.539
You just brought it together and it worked
out that way.

00:40:54.539 --> 00:41:04.279
It’s nothing!” It’s just like an egg
being put it in the incubator.

00:41:04.279 --> 00:41:05.529
It is that, simple thing.

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:10.569
You have done nothing! You have put life into
it, have you?

00:41:10.569 --> 00:41:11.769
Let us confess it now.

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:18.020
We cannot convert even one flower, transform
one flower into a fruit.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.310
Let us admit it.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.589
So what is this ego, then?

00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:27.859
“I do this and I do this,” “I would
like that and I would have this” and “I,

00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:28.859
I, I."

00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:29.859
Who is this ‘Mr.

00:41:29.859 --> 00:41:34.460
I’ who cannot do one living thing?

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:40.359
Just ask yourself! It’s a very simple question.

00:41:40.359 --> 00:41:44.089
So you reach a conclusion: it’s a myth.

00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:46.410
We do not do anything.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:51.329
As many times I have told you that, some people
going by train put all their luggage on their

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:52.329
heads.

00:41:52.329 --> 00:41:55.499
So they said, “Why are you carrying so much
luggage on your head?” They said, “Because

00:41:55.499 --> 00:41:58.769
they want to reduce the weight of the train."

00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:07.580
(laughter) This is just like that: put it
on your head! “I do it! I do it! I do it!”

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.930
But by brainwashing you I cannot reduce it.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:09.930
How [then]?

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:15.109
The myth has to be broken.

00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:19.480
The myth breaks when Kundalini rises.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:25.869
Then how you talk is a very different language:
“It is not coming."

00:42:25.869 --> 00:42:26.869
“It is not going."

00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:27.869
It is ‘it’.

00:42:27.869 --> 00:42:29.730
It becomes a third person.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.190
Then your power which is flowing through your
hands, you see that going through your hands,

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.190
which you are manoeuvring.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:40.200
You don’t say, “I am giving you Realisation!”
You just say, “It is going."

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.509
“It is rising."

00:42:41.509 --> 00:42:43.269
“It is not coming."

00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:48.349
Even if it is your son you will say, “I
cannot give, now what to do?” Like a lady

00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:53.619
came with me to America once and she was very
anxious that I must give Realisation to her

00:42:53.619 --> 00:42:54.619
son and all that.

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:56.809
So I told her, “Look at this.

00:42:56.809 --> 00:42:59.460
Now you have come all the way, I know, for
this purpose.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:05.039
But now if the Kundalini doesn’t rise, should
you want me to say that he is realised?”

00:43:05.039 --> 00:43:06.809
“No, no, no, Mataji, I know it doesn’t
rise."

00:43:06.809 --> 00:43:08.589
Then I said, “You give him a Realisation.

00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:09.690
I cannot give him, all right, you try."

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.089
Then, “But it doesn’t rise!” I said,
“Then what to do?

00:43:13.089 --> 00:43:17.980
If the Kundalini is not coming up, what can
we do about it?”

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.749
So, the Kundalini has to come spontaneously.

00:43:20.749 --> 00:43:28.240
It’s a living process but after Realisation
you start doing living things.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.660
You can raise the Kundalini.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.990
You can pulsate the Kundalini.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.790
I don’t know about pulsation: so far I have
not seen any Sahaja Yogi doing it.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:38.920
But you can raise it all right.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:45.900
You can give Realisation: with my photograph
it works better.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:54.140
You can give vibrations now to the plants,
to the fruit, or to any, any flower like this.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:59.480
If it is dying it will come to life.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:07.680
If you give vibrations say, to a field of,
or seeds of, wheat, they can be multiplied:

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.480
they can be ten times more than what they
were.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:18.769
Now you have started giving vibrations to
the trees, to the people, you are doing the

00:44:18.769 --> 00:44:19.769
living work.

00:44:19.769 --> 00:44:22.869
Now you have become the ocean of life.

00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:31.509
So far you were not because the power of life
[which] is to give life has come in you!

00:44:31.509 --> 00:44:46.700
Now you are living, before this you were dead,
in the sense that you were worshipping a dead

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.150
God called ‘ego’, now it’s the living
God within you — is the Spirit.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:58.660
Once you start accepting your Spirit all your
priorities change just like that, because

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:03.020
Spirit is joy and happiness.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:08.829
Spirit is the everything, so you start losing
all your interest into other things.

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:15.509
This is what is, when your auspiciousness
is of the greatest height that even your name

00:45:15.509 --> 00:45:22.569
can create something great, and photograph
can do wonders.

00:45:22.569 --> 00:45:29.670
If you become auspiciousness, you are the
holiest of the holy.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:38.279
For that we have to get rid of some of the
dirt and the dust, we have get rid of some

00:45:38.279 --> 00:45:44.440
of the false notions that we have and myths
of things: some people have the myth that

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:55.480
they are guilty and some people, as I told
you, have so many myths.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.510
But for giving up, this Kundalini works out.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.579
You allow Her to work it out, that’s all.

00:46:00.579 --> 00:46:01.579
It works.

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:03.390
It has worked with so many from England and
I am very proud of my Sahaja Yogis of England.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:13.310
If anybody asks me, “Where do you find the
best young people?” I said, “It’s in

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.450
England,” and they are surprised.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:37.049
They are not racialists, they are not all
this nonsense of being fanatics, nothing.

00:46:37.049 --> 00:46:44.670
Except for druggists and chemists they are.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:49.349
(laughter) That also due to mistakes.

00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:51.849
But that I can correct.

00:46:51.849 --> 00:46:55.480
But most of them are beautiful people, very
sincere, very honest and very good.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:10.819
Because England is the heart, is the heart
of the universe, of the world.

00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:14.059
Whatever happens in England gets known all
over the world.

00:47:14.059 --> 00:47:19.130
Do you know these people had this siege (at
the Iranian Embassy in Kensington on 30/4/1980);

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:22.359
today I read in the paper they were giving
an explanation about it, that, “We did it

00:47:22.359 --> 00:47:26.710
in England, not because we wanted to kill
anybody or anything, but we wanted to talk

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:30.650
to British government, so that if anything
happens in London it will be known all over

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:31.650
the world."

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:36.220
People still think that British are still
the sanest people in the West.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.119
Still they think like that, which is the truth.

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:47.869
So, we have a very good group of people here,
which has to expand.

00:47:47.869 --> 00:47:53.170
You have to find out more and more who are
seekers.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.640
But don’t tell them just now that you have
to give up any one of their druggists chemists

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.440
business, because if you tell them then they
will run away.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.930
We made a mistake like this, I know that.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:07.420
No, they will just give up, you don’t worry.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.910
Let them come.

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:18.190
Because once they have found it, even if we
tell them [to], they will not go back.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.940
Let them join.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.700
Let them come.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.910
By your auspiciousness, by your vibrations
and the fragrance of the flowers let all the

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:34.140
bees start hovering, knowing that there is
the scent of the beautiful nectar hidden under

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.320
these petals.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.599
I am sure all of them will come and one day
from England we’ll have the real spiritual

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:43.740
upsurge for the whole world.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:49.130
May God bless you.
