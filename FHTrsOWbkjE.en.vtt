00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:01.690
Right,

1
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:02.630
yes,

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.139
they're going to be all right.

3
00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:05.719
You're going to look after them,

4
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.710
is it

5
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.880
right?

6
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.520
Mm,

7
00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.149
what's happening?

8
00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:11.670
Feeling fine?

9
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.029
Feeling fine?

10
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.520
Are you happy?

11
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
OK.

12
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.899
When she has uh 2 months,

13
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.280
uh,

14
00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:24.020
my teacher said,

15
00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.459
hello,

16
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:25.729
I said hello.

17
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200
Yes,

18
00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:27.239
that's

19
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.259
funny.

20
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.849
There are many children like that.

21
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.869
Yes,

22
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.919
there are so many.

23
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:43.330
Yeah.

24
00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.409
I don't.

25
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.740
There's nothing that's.

26
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.369
I.

27
00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.580
A 3rd eye.

28
00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:04.680
You think that's the 3rd.

29
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.699
No,

30
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:04.720
no,

31
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.739
no,

32
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760
no,

33
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:04.779
no,

34
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800
no,

35
00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:04.819
no,

36
00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.940
don't do all that.

37
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.290
It

38
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:15.129
just

39
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.559
that's the same

40
00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.400
Oh

41
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.459
Oh,

42
00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:36.860
what's so Diana,

43
00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.459
I think it was Diana,

44
00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:40.779
that's such a nice thing.

45
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.550
Be

46
00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.790
Ah,

47
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.150
do you now?

48
00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.669
Perfect

49
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.019
He does.

50
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.199
That could be better.

51
00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.300
The skinny.

52
00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:08.309
What what about this

53
00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.488
we'll have to do something about it.

54
00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:20.548
You don't mind,

55
00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569
right.

56
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.639
Horrible.

57
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.070
Hello

58
00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:32.449
They don't

59
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.550
What's it?

60
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.050
No,

61
00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:38.399
but.

62
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.690
That's

63
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.300
Yeah.

64
00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:50.250
Why is yoga on the back?

65
00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:52.880
What's bad about yoga.

66
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.699
Well

67
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.300
He was not like those.

68
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.929
If you can see from his

69
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.940
book what he writes is that he went there

70
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.229
and saw this thing and he makes another movie and

71
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.199
he did this and that happened.

72
00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.270
It was what what you saw.

73
00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.479
No,

74
00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.690
no.

75
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.820
And apart from that,

76
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.169
He he got ideas,

77
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.580
these funny ideas.

78
00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.490
Of cutting their

79
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.300
And

80
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.759
it's not pretty.

81
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.070
It's not get

82
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.550
not to leave your family or not to become a not invented.

83
00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.570
Some sort of thing they have taken a clue from,

84
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.179
I think Catholics or

85
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.830
or priests,

86
00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:39.199
even the same.

87
00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:40.050
I mean we we

88
00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.600
that's,

89
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.009
you see,

90
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.289
you don't have to give up anything.

91
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.009
What can you give up in the name of God?

92
00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.809
What is so great?

93
00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:46.970
What can you give up?

94
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.190
All false heights.

95
00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.690
You give up this you suffer this nothing you don't have to do anything.

96
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.000
You just need a

97
00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:58.869
life which is balanced.

98
00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.050
Don't go to extremes in moderation.

99
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.380
Why did God ask you to

100
00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:07.250
do all these things,

101
00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:08.089
to shave your hair?

102
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.369
Otherwise,

103
00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.610
why did he give you the hair

104
00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:10.399
shave it.

105
00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:12.289
Yeah.

106
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.770
You understand my point,

107
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.089
but

108
00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:16.970
it's logical.

109
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.130
You can see what I'm saying is logical.

110
00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:22.919
Oh,

111
00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:23.348
I.

112
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.720
Oh.

113
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.989
Yes,

114
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.339
huh,

115
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.279
huh.

116
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950
or

117
00:04:58.329 --> 00:04:58.380
or plastic.

118
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.959
Um.

119
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.170
See,

120
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.489
see,

121
00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:17.820
Rama never took a son.

122
00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:19.250
I see Krishan never took it.

123
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.190
What's the Sana,

124
00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.720
there's no one.

125
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.589
Even all the girls are married.

126
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.950
After

127
00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:36.119
You all right?

128
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.160
Pa mothers.

129
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.440
A telegraph.

130
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.920
OK.

131
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.959
He.

132
00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:16.380
Oh that

133
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.079
that

134
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.079
that.

135
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.880
to do that

136
00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:35.609
that is you have to cut the tongue,

137
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.089
put it back here touch it here

138
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.959
he said that's it.

139
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.519
His early disciples are in India still wagging their tongues,

140
00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.869
you know,

141
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.160
they can't speak nothing is their tongue.

142
00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:52.950
Later on I think people must refuse to do that,

143
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.480
and this is this catering business.

144
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.209
It's like when the kundalini rises,

145
00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:00.670
something happens to him naturally because

146
00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.190
after all it's happening and when she rises there is a

147
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:06.519
contraction.

148
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.579
And

149
00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:09.170
then

150
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.500
the certain chakras are going to contraction to hold her up.

151
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.549
Then if they relax,

152
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.119
then I like just take your personal movement of your

153
00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:23.950
intestines something so spontaneous it happened that is right.

154
00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:26.510
Also when this chakra is

155
00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.290
opening out a little bit your tongue is pulling,

156
00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:31.269
but you don't feel,

157
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.440
don't feel just what's the use of pulling the

158
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.510
tongue by artificial method would be like moving a,

159
00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:42.390
a wheel of a car and saying that let the car drive.

160
00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:47.519
See when the car will start it will drive by itself by

161
00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:49.149
doing that what you are not going to achieve the result.

162
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.660
With all artificial.

163
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.029
Here we go.

164
00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:55.959
The telegraph.

165
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.380
They live a dig out.

166
00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:18.760
Your pregnancy.

167
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.880
Uh-huh.

168
00:08:32.058 --> 00:08:32.070
E.

169
00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:36.799
Right.

170
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:41.219
Eclipse.

171
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.210
Hi.

172
00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:52.059
Ah

173
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.580
I just don't know how to say that.

174
00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:43.890
or left hand hama of Korea or right hand niche ja.

175
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.719
Abe.

176
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:52.130
Working out.

177
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:55.979
Now how are you?

178
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.450
Did you feel the full breeze?

179
00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.130
Oh,

180
00:09:59.179 --> 00:09:59.609
good.

181
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.479
And you put your left and right there.

182
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.640
It's a kind of a mystery they were.

183
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.619
You have been to also the same person.

184
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.549
I naturally and like.

185
00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:22.760
That

186
00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:24.940
Left hand towards me,

187
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.669
right hand down.

188
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:28.659
If your idea.

189
00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.239
when it's all set,

190
00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:32.549
um,

191
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.909
just one as down boy.

192
00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:34.380
Where,

193
00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.789
where did he go?

194
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.059
Ananda Mayama.

195
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.979
Thank God she's dead now.

196
00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:47.700
How many she has she has.

197
00:10:52.309 --> 00:10:52.409
I

198
00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:53.450
Huh,

199
00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:56.070
you could find out.

200
00:10:57.969 --> 00:10:58.010
Do you see that.

201
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.750
Not only stay with one person.

202
00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:04.239
All her patients are,

203
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.109
uh,

204
00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.799
all her disciples are

205
00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:10.440
patients of Anan Mama disciples,

206
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.520
high blood pressure,

207
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.809
kidney trouble,

208
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.030
liver trouble

209
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.090
and heart.

210
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.700
She came to London to see me.

211
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:31.719
Nanny.

212
00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:37.039
Now one more is coming,

213
00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:38.119
Brahma Kumari,

214
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.710
or they have arrived or not

215
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.190
already arrived.

216
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.390
They're in the name of.

217
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.590
that.

218
00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:48.530
That's

219
00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:51.400
I was for the

220
00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:54.309
yeah but I.

221
00:11:59.479 --> 00:12:00.520
They have a place in Adelaides.

222
00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:07.359
You should use your brain,

223
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:07.890
your brain,

224
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:07.929
you should not

225
00:12:12.619 --> 00:12:14.369
yield to any of these nonsensical things that they talk to them.

226
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:14.450
I don't know why.

227
00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:26.719
Kumari or Kumar?

228
00:12:37.729 --> 00:12:37.929
Um,

229
00:12:37.969 --> 00:12:38.299
it's

230
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:43.570
Are you better?

231
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.330
eating anything?

232
00:12:46.609 --> 00:12:46.729
Well,

233
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:49.729
I do feel quite good and I'd like to feel good.

234
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.719
better

235
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:52.390
Yeah,

236
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.080
are you feeling the cool breeze is the point?

237
00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:55.530
Yes,

238
00:12:55.619 --> 00:12:57.570
I can feel the cool breeze on.

239
00:12:59.739 --> 00:12:59.969
Mhm

240
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.690
Earlier I had quite a strongly churned up stomach,

241
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.210
and that's just about gone.

242
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.429
Yesterday or.

243
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.909
I've been sitting here I mean I've been putting my hand on it.

244
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:16.729
It's stuff.

245
00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.169
So put your hand down there,

246
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:18.919
I can,

247
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.489
and you just say I am my own master.

248
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.609
I am my own guru.

249
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.549
You read too much.

250
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.390
Did you read too much?

251
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:26.409
No,

252
00:13:26.419 --> 00:13:26.440
forget it,

253
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.369
all these books.

254
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.299
Oh that's

255
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.359
look at the girl.

256
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.729
It's a different person

257
00:13:37.669 --> 00:13:38.950
you look at a different person?

258
00:13:40.969 --> 00:13:43.000
she's the teacher of teachers.

259
00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:47.890
I think you put your.

260
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:48.650
Left hand

261
00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:01.739
right hand on the side is.

262
00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:01.840
What else you did?

263
00:14:01.849 --> 00:14:01.869
I mean.

264
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:05.409
Um.

265
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.890
With my uh

266
00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:10.559
what.

267
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:14.969
You see,

268
00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:15.419
you know,

269
00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:16.080
Babarada

270
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.710
from N to roll ababa.

271
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.140
It's just

272
00:14:25.169 --> 00:14:26.609
I think all of that.

273
00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:28.429
Yeah

274
00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:36.260
OK

275
00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:38.479
Well that's

276
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.219
You that

277
00:14:41.729 --> 00:14:43.530
So I hand on your stomach.

278
00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:48.130
No,

279
00:14:48.169 --> 00:14:48.190
like her,

280
00:14:55.869 --> 00:14:55.880
yeah,

281
00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:55.919
I say mother,

282
00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:56.010
I'm my own guru.

283
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.059
Now what about you?

284
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.119
You to do the same.

285
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:56.210
I'm my own guru.

286
00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:56.260
You too.

287
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:56.299
I put your.

288
00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:58.710
Have my own.

289
00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:06.960
You see the block

290
00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:08.030
block is there in the head.

291
00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:13.239
All right,

292
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:15.559
I'm saying that.

293
00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:18.429
Hm that's say.

294
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.179
Lovely.

295
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:22.309
Better now.

296
00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:26.020
Only thing you have to learn

297
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:26.830
the method,

298
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.140
the via,

299
00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:28.940
the knowledge,

300
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.090
how to work it out.

301
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:30.710
That's all.

302
00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.030
I want your spirit is there.

303
00:15:33.729 --> 00:15:34.830
You don't need a guru.

304
00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:44.479
Hold on.

305
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.750
The heart,

306
00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:52.000
in your heart,

307
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.630
put your hand on the heart.

308
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.039
OK.

309
00:15:59.299 --> 00:15:59.549
Some

310
00:16:03.239 --> 00:16:03.659
Yeah

311
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.020
You have been to.

312
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.900
That's why you're feeling it better.

313
00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:19.520
What about you?

314
00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:22.010
Aren't you feeling

315
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.059
Yeah.

316
00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:38.570
That.

317
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.049
That's that seems to me I realise.

318
00:16:49.489 --> 00:16:49.820
see that

319
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.460
Good day.

320
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.799
Now you should look after this Adelaide centre,

321
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.070
yes.

322
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.229
Master this art.

323
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.140
I,

324
00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:06.430
I hope to send some of them here

325
00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:07.520
from Sydney.

326
00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:10.718
And they'll work it out for you.

327
00:17:11.618 --> 00:17:12.040
But

328
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.118
you should not import any more.

329
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.680
import any now you should become yourself great master.

330
00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:22.800
Is there anyone here who's got a big house where you could meet at all?

331
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.060
Half an hour from Adelaide,

332
00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:27.140
and half an hour away.

333
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.050
You're welcome to come.

334
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.189
It's just that they haven't established a centre yet and

335
00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:32.709
they're needing it but then you find out some other place

336
00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:44.790
else got one closer?

337
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.880
Did you take down their names.

338
00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:45.790
That would be good,

339
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.459
really.

340
00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:48.880
Come upstairs,

341
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.489
have a look.

342
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.449
You have to save so many of them.

343
00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:58.959
Imagine what an attack is from every sort of thing.

344
00:17:58.969 --> 00:17:59.030
We went to India.

345
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.900
This lady here was also off at her house,

346
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.709
but she says she's an hour's drive away.

347
00:18:17.349 --> 00:18:17.369
I can.

348
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.319
Right.

349
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.670
I don't know breeze.

350
00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:27.640
I feel it's the breeze that goes over my hands or anything like that.

351
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.589
Just have to say seriously that

352
00:18:31.979 --> 00:18:33.619
I am my own guru.

353
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:34.910
Yes.

354
00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:39.920
OK

355
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.719
Just know that you are your own,

356
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.260
right?

357
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.199
Just must be easy.

358
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.579
Must have faith in yourself.

359
00:18:58.589 --> 00:18:59.069
It's all right.

360
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.910
She's all right.

361
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:00.949
It's hard.

362
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.359
You have a breathing problem?

363
00:19:05.439 --> 00:19:05.689
OK.

364
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.109
What about your father?

365
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:08.810
Yeah.

366
00:19:12.369 --> 00:19:12.719
OK.

367
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:13.390
What's,

368
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.579
what about your father?

369
00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:18.829
What's wrong with it?

370
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:21.630
He had cancer.

371
00:19:24.699 --> 00:19:24.750
He died of cancer.

372
00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:32.130
Now you tell him,

373
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.180
close your eyes.

374
00:19:32.189 --> 00:19:32.219
Tell him

375
00:19:37.819 --> 00:19:38.930
that I'm all right.

376
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.219
Don't worry about me.

377
00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:42.780
Put your hand on the mother,

378
00:19:42.939 --> 00:19:43.479
right,

379
00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:44.119
on the mother,

380
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.150
yeah,

381
00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:47.469
I'm just telling that I'm all right.

382
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.849
Don't worry about me.

383
00:19:49.069 --> 00:19:49.729
Take your breath,

384
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.030
get your realisation.

385
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.609
Don't worry about me anymore.

386
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.369
I'm all right,

387
00:19:53.699 --> 00:19:53.900
you.

388
00:19:57.859 --> 00:19:58.270
State type.

389
00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:01.719
Are they all right children?

390
00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:03.839
Mata,

391
00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:05.040
are you feeling all right?

392
00:20:05.709 --> 00:20:05.829
Good,

393
00:20:05.969 --> 00:20:07.520
no shaking now in your hands.

394
00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:09.920
Still shaking.

395
00:20:16.969 --> 00:20:17.459
Is it shaking?

396
00:20:18.209 --> 00:20:18.489
No,

397
00:20:18.569 --> 00:20:18.750
good.

398
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:22.619
But she's inner.

399
00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:25.449
Ah,

400
00:20:30.589 --> 00:20:31.589
but a cultural shock,

401
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.050
eh.

402
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:35.229

403
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.319
They can look up,

404
00:20:47.449 --> 00:20:48.829
they kick in the Suralock.

405
00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:01.839
Yeah

406
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:05.410
Right.

407
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.670
Yeah.

408
00:21:20.199 --> 00:21:21.359
OK.

409
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:22.790
Mhm.

410
00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:25.380
Better,

411
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400

412
00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:34.689

413
00:21:34.699 --> 00:21:34.709
so

414
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:35.699

415
00:21:35.709 --> 00:21:35.719

416
00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:35.760
I come now.

417
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:36.579
Are you better now.

418
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:52.420
Not.

419
00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:57.869
So

420
00:21:59.709 --> 00:21:59.930
I

421
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:01.579
I'm all right,

422
00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:04.630
come forward now.

423
00:22:04.729 --> 00:22:06.300
I'll have to pass it on your left.

424
00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:07.760
I don't mind,

425
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.160
come forward.

426
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:11.680
Oh.

427
00:22:19.579 --> 00:22:20.219
And that other.

428
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:28.060
Yeah.

429
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.400
Can you see Sundalini at the back.

430
00:22:36.109 --> 00:22:36.119
Yes.

431
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:40.430
Yeah.

432
00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:46.459
Uh

433
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:47.930
Oh.

00:22:54.709 --> 00:22:54.719
I.

435
00:22:58.829 --> 00:22:58.839
No.

436
00:23:01.479 --> 00:23:01.489
Yeah,

437
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.979
it's it's difficult to see.

438
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.069
That's

439
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.180
no.

440
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:11.650
Just don't.

441
00:23:12.969 --> 00:23:15.229
Just don't put both hands on the mother

442
00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:17.800
and not to feel guilty at all

443
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.560
for anything that you have done,

444
00:23:19.719 --> 00:23:20.089
all right.

445
00:23:30.369 --> 00:23:30.380
At.

446
00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:36.959
Yeah.

447
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:44.329
Forgive,

448
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:48.920
forgive yourself,

449
00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:48.959
right?

450
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:51.290
Forgive yourself.

451
00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:54.760
Because after all you got to seek it.

452
00:23:56.439 --> 00:23:57.310
It doesn't matter.

453
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.510
I took the red so they all run away.

454
00:24:05.339 --> 00:24:06.260
run away from this,

455
00:24:06.459 --> 00:24:06.849
you know.

456
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.119
Ah better.

457
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:11.819
I just really

458
00:24:15.339 --> 00:24:15.660

459
00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:17.239
Thank you,

460
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:17.520
brother.

461
00:24:21.609 --> 00:24:21.680
what I gave you what I do.

462
00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:26.290
I did too.

463
00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:29.229
So I guess.

464
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:32.900
Not this,

465
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.380
not this last year anyway.

466
00:24:35.459 --> 00:24:36.020
Not this year,

467
00:24:36.089 --> 00:24:37.109
this last to perhaps.

468
00:24:40.199 --> 00:24:40.319
No,

469
00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:41.180
just eat it.

470
00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:47.380
Mm.

471
00:24:54.709 --> 00:24:55.949
I think I'll work on the.

472
00:24:57.489 --> 00:24:57.530
Where did she want?

473
00:24:59.439 --> 00:25:00.160
She's gone away with.

474
00:25:02.719 --> 00:25:02.750
Who is that?

475
00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:11.660
I'll just.

476
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.770
Huh,

477
00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:16.380
it's very good.

478
00:25:16.459 --> 00:25:16.839
It works.

479
00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:16.920
It's red colour.

480
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.189
It frightens that

481
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:22.489
yeah something like that.

482
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.439
It's better now.

483
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:27.390
How are you feeling?

484
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.349
Still a thing.

485
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.140
I think it left me off.

486
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.380
According to.

487
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.500
It's quite strongly.

488
00:25:39.989 --> 00:25:40.000
I.

489
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:48.599
In the in the

490
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:53.630
Ily damaged yourself,

491
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.170
right.

492
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:00.579
Right.

493
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.280
Every church on the left side

494
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.739
is damaged.

495
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.520
something some conversation.

496
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.040
little warm.

497
00:26:20.469 --> 00:26:20.479
I.

498
00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:32.430
the wind bing it.

499
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.099
I think it's the wind from around here.

500
00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:43.040
so

501
00:26:50.069 --> 00:26:50.079
What.

502
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.520
so many places you go to one place.

503
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:00.219
Yes,

504
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:00.719
I do.

505
00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:02.290
Like a study.

506
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.400
I tell I say is Buddhist stay be Buddhist.

507
00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:09.410
I too much.

508
00:27:12.489 --> 00:27:13.040
Now I

509
00:27:16.699 --> 00:27:17.000
Mother,

510
00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:18.060
I use the Holy Ghost.

511
00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:24.030
I,

512
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.339
Mother,

513
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.079
you wouldn't.

514
00:27:25.089 --> 00:27:25.099
No,

515
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:25.609
no,

516
00:27:25.619 --> 00:27:26.369
you wouldn't.

517
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:28.880
they

518
00:27:32.689 --> 00:27:32.969
I

519
00:27:35.219 --> 00:27:35.310
I

520
00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:43.380
Yeah

521
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:47.310
Slightly cool.

522
00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:50.709
Yeah.

523
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:53.599
Whatever it is,

524
00:27:53.609 --> 00:27:53.660
it's not strong,

525
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:53.680
right,

526
00:27:53.689 --> 00:27:53.839
but you have to cooperate a little bit with yourself and have

527
00:28:03.089 --> 00:28:04.219
because it's so many things,

528
00:28:04.239 --> 00:28:04.359
isn't it because God who get him in anything.

529
00:28:10.739 --> 00:28:12.180
How can God forget it?

530
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:12.920
OK.

531
00:28:27.869 --> 00:28:28.130
the far right.

532
00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:35.670
According to me it's better.

533
00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:37.939
That's all I can say not yet all right,

534
00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:39.140
hm.

535
00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:41.989
So we'll let you know.

536
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.189
Tell him how to do.

537
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:45.010
All right,

538
00:28:45.089 --> 00:28:45.589
let's try this.

539
00:28:51.489 --> 00:28:51.530
He's alright.

540
00:28:53.349 --> 00:28:53.880
He's good.

541
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.420
How is it kept out of all this?

542
00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:57.760
That's a good idea not to be too fast.

543
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.969
Take this message.

544
00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:13.089
that

545
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.959
that's.

546
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.810
Ask him also to bring sugar and everything

547
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.089
or to bring it on.

548
00:29:35.869 --> 00:29:36.439
What

549
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.099
I spent a lot of money.

550
00:29:40.109 --> 00:29:40.800
Then he gets,

551
00:29:40.949 --> 00:29:41.619
he becomes

552
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:42.640
mad you become.

553
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:43.469
That's what happens.

554
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.109
The other

555
00:29:48.979 --> 00:29:48.989
Yeah

556
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.810
Are you feeling better now?

557
00:29:54.349 --> 00:29:55.510
Are you feeling relaxed?

558
00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:03.329
Did you feel anything.

559
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:13.780
Um

560
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:15.989
Amazingly,

561
00:30:16.069 --> 00:30:17.300
nobody is disturbing us.

562
00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:19.369
All these cars have come.

563
00:30:19.489 --> 00:30:20.489
Nobody's bothered about us.

564
00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:24.099
Yeah.

565
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.439
Yeah

566
00:30:34.939 --> 00:30:34.959
I just.

567
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:38.890
Yeah.

568
00:30:42.489 --> 00:30:42.500
Yeah.

569
00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:47.280
And how to feel.

570
00:30:49.189 --> 00:30:50.300
Don't get upset.

571
00:30:50.709 --> 00:30:53.540
We'll have to work it out after how many days is it.

572
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:03.170
That's.

573
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640
Yeah

574
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:06.630
Well.

575
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:23.880
Uh.

576
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:32.300
Hey.

577
00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:37.319
I

578
00:31:38.609 --> 00:31:38.619
Hm.

579
00:31:44.229 --> 00:31:44.270
Can the call please.

580
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:50.069
No,

581
00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:50.339
I just ask a question.

582
00:31:52.969 --> 00:31:52.979
I.

583
00:31:53.989 --> 00:31:54.000
Right.

584
00:31:56.859 --> 00:31:56.880
Mother,

585
00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:56.920

586
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:56.949
Mother,

587
00:31:56.959 --> 00:31:57.050

588
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.180

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:08.978
No.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:26.978
Yeah.

609
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:30.860
Uh.

00:34:42.888 --> 00:34:42.898
OK.

614
00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:50.000

00:34:53.228 --> 00:34:53.629
I.

Yeah.

620
00:35:21.169 --> 00:35:21.639
OK.

621
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:22.870
It's it.

622
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:25.850
Are you all right?

623
00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:30.399
Yeah

624
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.250
We should be

625
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.050
You know.

626
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.010
Yeah

627
00:35:54.909 --> 00:35:54.919
OK.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.419
I ask you like it that much.

629
00:36:09.629 --> 00:36:10.580
Will they bring it in

630
00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:28.290

631
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:55.620
Uh,

633
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.610
I think

634
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.090
it's not all right.

635
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.840
I've tried everything and the business is horrifying.

636
00:37:15.419 --> 00:37:15.429
Yeah

637
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.949
Can I just do a little manipulation on the neck now?

638
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.560
Just turn your head

639
00:37:24.989 --> 00:37:26.239
Just when everything gets better.

640
00:37:33.149 --> 00:37:34.010
feeling it better on the

641
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.510
No I

642
00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:40.979
The incarnation of

00:37:43.689 --> 00:37:44.139
look at how

644
00:38:13.879 --> 00:38:14.540
It's

645
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:15.429
Then

646
00:38:19.389 --> 00:38:19.439
sucking in

647
00:38:21.489 --> 00:38:21.560
I

648
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.550
on your right hand now.

649
00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:37.909
You got it just forehead.

650
00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:40.689
That.

651
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:46.949
No,

652
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.419
no.

653
00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.459
Its flowing

654
00:38:59.149 --> 00:38:59.159
Just

655
00:39:01.209 --> 00:39:01.229
going out.

656
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.389
I can afford that.

657
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:24.070
So.

658
00:39:29.669 --> 00:39:29.959
Do you like that?

659
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.020
really hard.

660
00:39:35.489 --> 00:39:37.080
What is to suffer so much.

661
00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:41.929
That's what

662
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:45.219
Let's say bye bye.

663
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:46.000
It's here.

664
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.429
It's yeah.

665
00:39:51.629 --> 00:39:52.040
Yeah,

666
00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:52.360

667
00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:52.989

668
00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:55.709
OK

669
00:39:58.169 --> 00:39:58.290
Hey.

670
00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:03.000
Hm.

671
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.149
That's what we see.

672
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.159
See if you're feeling it on the hand.

673
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:17.770
Yeah.

674
00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:21.030
Like

675
00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:27.959
experience.

676
00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:32.979
No.

677
00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:35.379
That's the thing,

678
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.179
but don't get disappointed and disheartened.

679
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.050
I know.

680
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:51.120
Just see if it tingling changes to cool.

681
00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:53.330
I

682
00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:57.040
Dealing with the beginning.

683
00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:58.540
It's a big.

684
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.510
Better.

685
00:41:10.399 --> 00:41:11.250
Tingling's getting there.

686
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:13.139
I

687
00:41:18.919 --> 00:41:19.290
Huh

688
00:41:20.389 --> 00:41:20.469
But

689
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.159
Huh?

690
00:41:27.959 --> 00:41:29.600
According to the.

691
00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.459
these rules.

692
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:48.449
The

693
00:41:50.229 --> 00:41:52.270
Very nice to take all the money and everything.

694
00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:12.139
OK.

695
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:20.030
What the.

696
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.169
Take time to neutralise the person,

697
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.040
but have patience with it.

698
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.020
Today is the 2nd day when you are with me,

699
00:42:30.139 --> 00:42:30.540

700
00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:40.209
Like tomorrow and the fine all do and also do what they said to be done.

701
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:40.330
Religiously is nice.

702
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:40.360
I said,

703
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:41.139
are you all right?

704
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.070
Cool.

705
00:42:44.399 --> 00:42:44.679
OK,

706
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:44.919
just do that.

707
00:42:46.709 --> 00:42:47.409
Would it be possible to,

708
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.310
this is not

709
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.280
cane sugar,

710
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.320
but could it be added to that?

711
00:42:50.399 --> 00:42:50.520
I mean,

712
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.189
it's cane sugar,

713
00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:51.709
but it's not,

714
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.189
uh,

715
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.600
quite fine sugar.

716
00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.149
But if that was added to sugar.

717
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:01.080
OK.

718
00:43:04.419 --> 00:43:04.429
Mhm.

719
00:43:04.439 --> 00:43:04.469
Are you alright?

720
00:43:04.479 --> 00:43:04.489
No,

721
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:04.520
not really.

722
00:43:16.389 --> 00:43:16.439
Thank

723
00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:19.889
Keep your hands up.

You mean

725
00:43:26.429 --> 00:43:28.649
make it easier for her so she doesn't have to reach.

726
00:43:29.379 --> 00:43:30.129
It just moves in a little bit.

727
00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:38.530
Is it cool?

728
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.310
2.

729
00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:49.110
coming up there it's not the window it's the wind blowing.

730
00:43:50.479 --> 00:43:51.469
There's no.

731
00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.360
You've been to some,

732
00:43:58.409 --> 00:43:59.000

00:43:59.169 --> 00:43:59.760
I just,

734
00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:02.889
you mean for help or not for spiritual help.

735
00:44:02.969 --> 00:44:03.889
I do a lot of reading,

736
00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:05.639
but I don't really go to anybody.

737
00:44:05.929 --> 00:44:07.939
I'm still searching for something to believe.

738
00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.419
Put your hand down there.

739
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.739
And just ask the question,

740
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.000
are you the source of all the knowledge?

741
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:22.909
Mother,

742
00:44:23.399 --> 00:44:23.639
