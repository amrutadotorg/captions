00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:19.853
It’s only the human beings who have got
this freedom,

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:24.214
the will, “free will” as they call it.

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:27.966
If you want to go to heaven, you can go
to heaven.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:32.573
If you want, you can go to hell.

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:40.385
And that is what we are facing now
in modern times,

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:50.789
that if we do not take course to sensible
things

00:00:52.643 --> 00:00:59.968
we may be all wiped out of the surface
of the Earth.

00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:07.025
I’ve been telling since long that it
affects our genes.

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:12.207
Supposing a father is an alcoholic, the son
also gets it in his genes.

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:16.127
So many things, most of the vulnerability
that you have

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:29.642
or what you can call the susceptibility
is coming from these genes.

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:34.403
Now the susceptibility to do something
wrong,

00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:40.506
always to take to something bad,
whatever is destructive,

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:44.013
comes from the genes;

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:54.357
and it was said that the Asians have
two genes which protects them,

00:01:54.558 --> 00:02:01.684
bars them for doing something wrong.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:08.403
Might be a culture research, I don’t know.

00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:13.552
And the Aboriginals and the people who
have lived in the nature

00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:17.514
have only one gene that protects.

00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:23.167
But for white skin, there’s no gene
to protect. Can you imagine?

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:30.184
They are left to winds. Whichever way
the wind blows, they start blowing.

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:38.470
So, it’s such a big problem with the white
skin.

00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.743
Also they think they are the higher race,
but they are not

00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:44.813
according to the biological process,
you can say.

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:49.488
You can see the Germans, what they did.
I mean, killing children in the gas...

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.113
How could they do it? I mean, I just –
unimaginable.

00:02:58.018 --> 00:03:04.068
The way they have killed people in all
the African countries also,

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.526
specially in America, the Spanish.

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:15.961
Unimaginable. The way they have treated
other people everywhere.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:23.344
Cruelty comes to them first. Very easily
they can become cruel.

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:30.186
They take to bad things very easily.

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:33.103
There are some Sahaja Yogis who came
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:39.584
stayed in Sahaja Yoga for so much and
again they have taken to their bad life.

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:46.256
So now it is very much to be understood

00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:51.806
that you have to be very careful and
cautious.

00:03:53.077 --> 00:03:56.677
The bhoots will first catch you.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.600
That’s why so much schizophrenia
everywhere.

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:06.029
If you – schizophrenia is so much true
in America. So much.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.064
All kinds of horrible diseases they have.

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:13.346
But I can’t understand how they got it.

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:18.686
So one has to be very careful

00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:24.138
that after coming to Sahaja Yoga you must
stick on

00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:34.419
to your sublime Self, to your glorious
Self, otherwise it is dangerous.

00:04:35.563 --> 00:04:41.799
When one thing about Sahaja Yoga I was
amazed that how it cleanses the genes.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.515
Actually, gene in a Persian language is
called like a “bhoot,” you know Jin,

00:04:52.716 --> 00:05:00.442
but this whole theory is now showing

00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:12.084
that white-skinned people are more
vulnerable to all kinds of things.

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:17.693
And I think they are the ones who have
suffered a lot

00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:20.779
because there must have been a big fight
within,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.958
that ‘What is this nonsense we are doing?
Why should we do it?’

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:35.862
And that’s why so many of them started
seeking, so many of them.

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.481
The seeking is so much suggested in Indian
culture, everything,

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:47.778
but nobody did that the way you people
were seeking, it’s creditable;

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.078
because you realized, perhaps, that this
is a terrible life you are into.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.873
‘Why are we here, so unprotected?’.

00:05:57.074 --> 00:06:05.481
And that’s why so much of – we have so
many Sahaja Yogis all over the world

00:06:05.682 --> 00:06:12.430
who have taken to Sahaja Yoga, and are
steadying themselves

00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:17.037
and are progressing beautifully.

00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:23.026
That means the genes which were not
protecting have become protective now,

00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:31.327
one thing, and those genes which make you
vulnerable to things also become clean

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:37.231
and you cannot get to those things.
They said the people who get AIDS

00:06:37.432 --> 00:06:43.525
are the ones who have genes like that,
they are vulnerable to AIDS.

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:56.233
So, this new dimension that the science
has exposed before us

00:06:56.434 --> 00:07:07.285
tells us two things, that by living like
a white country,

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:14.502
people saw the hell itself and that’s why
they have taken now,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.093
with such a big jump, to Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:30.987
And your duty is to see that you get more
out of all that hell.

00:07:31.188 --> 00:07:35.912
Around you, if you see – I mean, when you
read the newspaper you are shocked.

00:07:36.113 --> 00:07:39.289
It’s not the accident by which people die,

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:46.765
but all kinds of diseases, murders, this,
that going on. God knows, such violence.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:50.035
Specially in America, you’ll be surprised

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.767
that I can’t even wear my wedding ring
there.

00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:59.498
My husband doesn’t allow Me to wear
My wedding ring, even mangal sutra.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.401
And what goes wrong with them, I don’t
know,

00:08:03.602 --> 00:08:10.436
that they take to violence without
any difficulties.

00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:14.251
We had one gentleman who came from America.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:18.174
He had already murdered his brother and
murdered his mother also –

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:24.382
mother and brother, both. I said,
“How could you do that?”

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:29.067
And so many you will find in England
who have killed their children.

00:08:29.647 --> 00:08:32.940
And now, as I was telling you, it’s
a very dangerous situation

00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:38.385
when you [know], I read about the genes
and the no protective genes;

00:08:38.588 --> 00:08:43.910
because I remember once, one student
who had gone to Cambridge.

00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:46.815
He came back and he said, ‘What surprises
me,

00:08:47.016 --> 00:08:53.073
he – they take to drugs like a venture.
They take to anything bad like a venture,

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:55.915
while for us, we are frightened, you know,
we think this is wrong.

00:08:56.116 --> 00:09:00.642
All throughout, we know it is wrong and
we are doing wrong, knowingly.’

00:09:00.843 --> 00:09:02.707
So he said, ‘I don’t’, he told Me,

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:07.160
‘I don’t know how they get over this
protectiveness.’

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:10.832
They just go headlong into it, anything,
you know,

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:15.495
a love affair with any unknown girl,
they’ll sleep with anyone.

00:09:15.696 --> 00:09:20.813
How can they do it? They don’t even
think whether it is right or wrong.

00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:28.851
That’s what is true, that to introspect
and see for yourself

00:09:29.052 --> 00:09:34.111
whether it is good or bad, is very
important.

00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:37.360
Now also we have some national problems.

00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:40.642
Different nationality has different
problems.

00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:44.289
But in Sahaja Yoga I think we are washed
of all these things.
