00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:15.950
We have had Bhairava Puja in Belgium and now
I thought today let us have Mahakali Puja

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:27.440
because yesterday’s experience, last night’s
experience, was the work of Mahakali.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:41.640
She has a double role all the time, she’s
at two extremes. On one side she is full of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:52.710
joy, giver of joy, she’s very happy when
she sees her disciple are joyous. Joy is her

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.069
own quality, is her energy, and yesterday
you must have been amazed to see so many middle-aged

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:12.600
ladies of France smiling and laughing. I’d
never seen them smiling; it’s very surprising

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.289
how they were so joyous and so very happy
and this is the energy of Mahakali that gives

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.640
you all that joy after Realization and the
joy you enjoy among yourselves, all these

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.259
are the qualities of Mahakali and when they
will read out the names of Mahakali you will

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:49.929
know how her powers manifest in Sahaja Yoga
and how it has helped you all to get drenched

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.469
into the Ocean of Joy.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:02:12.730
To
begin with I have to tell you one thing that
Mahakali Puja, when you are doing, you have

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:24.420
to feel a joy within yourself, and joy from
other Sahaja Yogis. If you, if you cannot

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.750
feel that, that means you are not yet grown
and there’s some problem, maybe with your

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.400
parents, maybe with your children, maybe it’s
family, with your country, whatever it is

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.310
but there’s some sort of a conditioning
which is working out that doesn’t give you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:55.819
that joy. And to grow into Sahaja Yoga is
very important, which I think people don’t

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.280
understand, even if they live in ashrams,
they don’t understand one thing, that you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:12.860
have to be collective. If you are not collective
then you are thrown out, gradually. Now this

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:21.890
Mahakali power has got seven strings you can
say this, and these strings are there to throw

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.510
you out into collective subconscious (next
couple of words inaudible). Like as in the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.019
sitar you have seen for the resonance, there
are other strings also. So once you start

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.530
getting out of the collectivity it is the
Mahakali Herself, picks you out and starts

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:53.950
throwing you out, slowly slowly to the subconscious
area and where you just disappear. And all

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:02.180
kinds of problems start, I have seen this
happening in every country, that people who

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:12.180
do not attend the collective meditation. For
France I have the same report and I think

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.390
the people who do not grow will be thrown
out.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:27.789
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action,
as the Mahakali has a double action. She’s

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.539
extremely loving, full of joy, full of happiness
and She’s the one who’s extremely cruel,

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.710
wrathful, She’s the one who’s the slayer
of all the demons and the evil, and those

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.870
people who try to do evil. So once you are
thrown out into the left side then you can

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.460
imagine, you can develop any kind of left-side
diseases to begin with, Mooladhara diseases

00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:00.990
are the worst, you develop diseases like mellitus,
this, er, er, you must have heard of the disabilities

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.930
caused by the muscles getting degenerated.
All muscular degeneration comes from this

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:19.430
problem. So at any cost that must be avoided.
But if you are not in the collective, if you

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.020
do not understand the collective, and if you
are out of the collective you’ll be surprised

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:34.310
that negative forces will join together and
they’ll pull you out. So this is one of

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:44.900
the things that happens, so be very careful
that don’t avoid the collective programmes.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:56.780
The, another problem about Mahakali is that,
that She’s the one who gives you the feeling

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:12.139
for your wife, for your husband, She is the
one. Now there also, the same problem. If

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:24.009
both of them are alright, She’s alright
but if She finds any one of them going astray

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.819
She’ll throw that person out and out and
out and the, another person, if that person

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:35.039
is attached to that person also will be thrown
out. So this business of falling in love,

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.050
this nonsense that we have here, that you
fall in love, but the word is all right because

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:46.720
you fall really in love. It’s a real falling
happens. So what happens when you start falling

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.150
in love, there’s a kind of a maya of this
Mahakali and you just get infatuated, your

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.639
ego gets pampered, or something like that,
or you have certain ideas of a wife or something

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.539
and then you think ‘Oh, that’s the one
for me.’

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:09.129
So in these cases only two things can happen;
either you can be lost completely because

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:17.199
of your wife or your husband whom you adore
and admire and you, you’ve finished, I mean

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:23.129
your personality is finished. Or else, the
another thing which is even more serious is

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:27.759
that, that you’ll completely break forever
and hate each other. That’s why they say

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:37.470
that there’s a love and hate relationship.
How can love be hate? But it becomes, because

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:45.580
of the, this quality of the Goddess that She
is on one side extremely loving, extremely

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:55.870
kind, extremely soft, she goes up to a point.
And then She throws you on the other side,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.479
and that is why in these countries where people
always fall in love, you see, they don’t

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:06.789
marry otherwise, unless and until they have
fallen in love. In that they cross all the

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:13.289
maryadas also. In falling in love they will
marry somebody who is already married or who

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:23.599
is, they’ll carry on with somebody who is
not yet divorced or also they will have marriages,

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:29.530
er, among themselves in the same household
or something. All kinds of things they do

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:35.940
and the old woman marries a young man or a
young, er, old man marries a young girl, like

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.860
that, all nonsensical things, without any
maryadas. And they do not stick together,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:49.380
they have no maryadas. To marry is to create
a maryada, maryada of your behaviour and this

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:56.020
is the maryada which, if you do not keep,
er, keep, then this Mahakali gets into it.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.030
So first of all one has to be collective,
the ones who are not collective, the ones

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:06.800
who do not attend every time a collective
programme. You might give suggestions, that

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.580
you would like to come for such and such thing.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.600
For example, I have already explained, that
you shouldn’t talk, put my, there are so

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.150
many tapes which they have not, never heard.
List…let them listen to my tape then go

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.600
into meditation and then do the aarti and
finish it off. Because these tapes are to

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:33.720
be heard again and again. Now those who get
any questions out of those tapes can, next

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.750
time, discuss it before starting the tapes.
That’s a very good thing and that works.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:47.170
In India nobody speaks, they just put my tapes
on or show my video, after that they just

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:54.810
have meditation and aarti. Finished. After
that nobody talks. But before starting it,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:02.190
they do it is to talk to each other and discuss
the problems or discuss anything that they

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:10.080
felt about the previous programme. Because
you have not come here to marry someone or

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:16.590
to fall in love into something. You have not
come here to get after some woman because

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.250
she’s your wife or some man because he’s
your husband. You have had so many husbands

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:31.470
and wives in previous lives. But you have
come here for your ascent; and if you have

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:37.770
come here for your ascent you have to keep
a watch. How is your mind working? Supposing

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.870
I say that you should have good married life,
of course, I do say, you should have good

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:50.860
married life. But not at the cost of losing
your ascent. It has happened with people,

00:10:50.860 --> 00:11:01.600
we have lost a complete, I should say, a city
like that. Such stupidity came, comes up over

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:08.260
people. So be careful not to get lost, you
have not come here to have only a happy married

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:16.180
life but happy married life is just one step.
But if that step is taking you away from the

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:25.140
real path of your ascent is better to be careful.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:31.860
Also we must understand the innocence means
purity, purity of thought. As I explained

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:37.290
yesterday I hope you understood the meaning
of purity. Purity is to be understood much

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:52.680
more by Europeans. Very important. Specially
French. Because the whole society is suffering.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:00.510
Society can only be pure if the family life
is pure. Not only that but your relations

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:09.010
with each other are pure. Like I was told
that somebody fell in love in Ganapatipule.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:16.730
I mean you go for a pilgrimage. It’s like
you have to go to buy a sari and you end up

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:26.200
with a shaving stick. It’s that stupid.
You are coming to Ganapatipule for a, for

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:40.810
what? You are coming there for your ascent,
it’s a pilgrimage. But in the pilgrimage

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:47.800
I’ve never heard anybody falls in love with
each other and goes to marriage. So this bhoot

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.610
of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja
Yoga, that is one of the biggest loads. And,

00:12:53.610 --> 00:13:06.660
and must understand that purity means chastity.
Innocence means chastity, not only physical

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:17.020
also mental chastity. You have to have mental
chastity, if you don’t have mental chastity

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.870
you cannot ascend.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:31.470
Actually in the West it is more mental that
physical, is a fact. And that’s why their

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.420
brains (inaudible?) have gone off. And they
are becoming just like, I think, potatoes

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:42.270
now, I think. Because if you go on mentally
imagining and playing around and working it

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:47.670
out this way, it’s going to be absolutely
dangerous because it’s all imagination,

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:53.540
it has nothing to do with reality. The more
you get into this kind of a nonsense the more

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:59.460
you become away from reality. That never means
you should be dry, it never means you should

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:08.530
be, er, negligent of your responsibility,
does not mean. As I said, the sap…(Shri

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:33.060
Mataji speaks aside in Hindi). As I’ve said
that the sap in the tree rises, all right?

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:40.850
Then it purifies, it nourishes every part
of the plant separately in a different way.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:46.120
Like it’s a mother, so mother, father, is
a father, sister, is a sister, brother, is

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:54.410
a sister (Shri Mataji corrects), brother is
a brother. The brother-sister relations cannot

00:14:54.410 --> 00:15:08.540
become husband-wife relations. How can it
be? (Speaks aside again in Hindi). Now what

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:15.120
happens really is that such a confusion in
the mind and it has created tremendous problems

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.760
for us.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:30.210
Then the sap nourishes all these things and
comes back. It doesn’t get attached to something:

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:35.960
‘Oh, she’s my wife so the first priority
is my wife.’ Because I’ve said, of course,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:41.990
family life has to be all right, you must
look after your family life. But that doesn’t

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.770
mean that you make everything suffer, that
doesn’t mean that your ascent should be

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.560
finished. Cannot be that.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.750
You are not like ordinary people, you are
saints and for the saints the main thing is

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:03.820
their ascent, not their family life, not their
material possessions, nothing. Nor their children,

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:16.570
but their ascent, once they ascend everything
will ascend with it.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:26.140
Now the understanding of chastity should be
there. It can come to you very easily if you

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:34.210
ascend, it’s such a vicious circle. It is
such a vicious circle. Now first of all you

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:42.820
get your Realization, all right. Now you must
know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:52.350
shakti because she’s the primordial. Mahakali
shakti is the primordial shakti within us.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:17:00.400
And is the Kundalini is the Mahakali shakti.
And she remains as a virgin within you. Means

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.079
She’s purity, She has a power to purify.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:19.220
All that happens when you get your Realization.
She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:30.750
on you. Now the one who’s sitting there
is Shri Ganesh. Now people don’t understand

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:45.780
what is innocence is. Shri Ganesha is sitting
there and He is the one who resides on mooladhara,

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:52.930
even over his Mother because He’s like a
guard, and He’s the one who tells whether

00:17:52.930 --> 00:18:01.960
She can ascend or not. Unless and until He
gives permission She cannot ascend. So Shri

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:17.440
Ganesha gives the ascending sort of, er, OK,
alright, you can rise. And he stops all his

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:27.560
work. You have seen th… Me, sitting for
hours together. I don’t have to go even

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:35.030
to the bathroom or anywhere because Shri Ganesha
stops all his work. He’s only worried now

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:45.440
about the ascent and on every chakra he checks
your purity, and then accordingly the Kundalini

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:55.440
tries to purify (you?). But when it reaches
the mental level, mental level has all these

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:02.970
funny ideas of romance, this nonsense, that
nonsense. I was surprised the other day, there

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:09.250
was a girl who was having a trouble with her
husband of expressing her love to her husband

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:15.980
after marriage; before marriage she was all
right. So I told her: ‘Read some book where

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:24.470
they have described the romance between husband
and wife’. So she said, ‘There is no book

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:33.120
I have known.’ Then I asked one professor
to find out, he said there’s no such book.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:41.250
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the
marriage. But also with maryadas, not at the

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:50.350
cost of Sahaja Yoga, not at the cost, cost
of your ascent. So all these ideas people

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:55.750
have in the West, I know you are so much conditioned
about it. So, you say now let us see, this

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:02.280
is some (? inaudible word) after all, we have
to give all the benefit to them.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:10.730
Now we select people, we do everything. Is
all the work of Mahakali because you have

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:17.130
to work on the vibrations, it’s all the
work of Mahakali. And after marriages also

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:32.070
some marriages do fail. The reason being they
do not know what is the purpose of their marriages.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:41.230
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali
is that She is purity. Absolute purity. And

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:53.370
that purity if we cannot imbibe within us,
we cannot be Sahaja Yogis. Now this mind is

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.800
so much conditioned, I know. Our children
will be much better off than ourselves. Then

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:05.540
they won’t have these conditionings as we
have had. And so many problems can be just

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.040
avoided if you really become pure people.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:15.240
I see in the other society in which I move,
nobody seems to be safe, somebody’s wife

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.580
is running with somebody’s husband, somebody’s
daughter is running with somebody’s father,

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:26.280
somebody’s running, a boy running with somebody’s
mother. Next day you find somebody else standing

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:32.400
there husband and wife. Or sometimes it’s
so biz…funny that you can’t believe it,

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:40.810
how can it be? And everybody’s in danger.
A man goes to the house, he finds his wife

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:48.220
run away with another man. Or a man goes for
his work, he’s run away with another woman.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:57.470
So the, She, She’s the one, She gives you
stithi, the state. Stithi means consolidation.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:09.700
Without your proper consolidation into your
purity, not into your romantic life, you cannot

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:19.650
rise. Like when we make the aeroplane, first
we have to consolidate it. Fix it up properly,

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:30.240
work it out, so that when it goes in the air
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:41.130
In the same way when we are ascending Shri
Ganesha does that, he just stops the action

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.800
of excretion completely and the ascent starts.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:53.510
They are doing their work all right, despite
the fact they have been insulted, they have

00:22:53.510 --> 00:23:00.150
been neglected, we have misbehaved, whatever
we might have done, they are doing their jobs

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:05.990
alright. We can see it, so many people getting
their Realization. But what are we doing about

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:19.590
it? We cannot be even collective, we cannot
attend collective things. And look at them

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:25.620
how generous they are, they are extremely
collective, they are extremely collective,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:38.450
to such an extent to somebody supposing worships
Shri Krishna. His heart will catch. Why? Because

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.720
you must also worship Shiva.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:53.330
They are so collective and so much connected
with Me. So they are all collective, in the

00:23:53.330 --> 00:24:01.809
same way you are also devas, you also should
be collective. As soon as you become collective

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:08.470
all these nonsensical things will drop out.
All these ideas will drop out. You do not

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:15.030
become collective because you have not dropped
out all these things, or else you are afraid

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:25.380
of dropping them out. So let us know what
is our purpose (is?), our purpose is to ascend.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.580
And what is the Mahakali power is doing for
us.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:38.340
She is giving you your ascent through Kundalini.
She is purify; She’s giving you all the

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:51.680
powers. She is protecting you all the time,
She is giving you joy. But what are we doing

00:24:51.680 --> 00:25:05.320
for Her? Her only, only desire is that my
children should be saintly, that they should

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:14.000
have beautiful qualities of a saint. That
he doesn’t fall at every woman, fall at

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.320
every man. It’s not so cheap, you see. And
mentally specially, I mean if the Sahasrara

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:36.600
is spoilt how can Sahaja Yoga work out? The
whole play is of the Sahasrara. And that purity

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:45.710
should manifest. Through you we are going
to change the world. Through no-one else.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.770
The Sahaja Yogis who are going to change the
world.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:58.730
Now look at the generosity, when my body is
so generous. Yesterday one lady came, I think

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:07.070
she, she had a very bad liver. She came downstairs
and I, my liver started pumping vibrations,

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:12.610
terrible. She had a very bad liver though;
she had taken drugs, I mean she had taken

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:19.600
drugs and all that suffering was done to me,
by this liver of mine. It didn’t think that

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:27.230
‘Oh Mother, she’s come all the way out
suffering’ so started just pumping for that

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:37.270
woman. So generous it is. And they are so
generous themselves the way they bestow blessings

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:46.600
(all over?). How they are hard working, how
they are running about. What are we giving

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.340
them?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:56.150
They give us joy, they look after us, they
look after our children, they look after everything,

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:02.300
they manage everything. Now what are we doing
for them?

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.570
Also I’ve heard that people don’t help
when they have to do postering, they have

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:16.320
to do, very few people come up. This is being
ungrateful, very ungrateful to those. All

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:25.020
the deities are present when you are having
those collective programmes. And surprisingly

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:32.570
the old Sahaja Yogis are more difficult than
the new ones. I mean this I just, surprising.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:39.270
I mean are they becoming now out of date or
something? Christ has said ‘First will be

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:46.530
the last’. I hope that’s not going to
happen. Sort of a confidence they develop,

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:54.080
‘Oh, we are old Sahaja Yogis.’ We have
had a horrible results in London of this consciousness

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.760
that ‘We are old, we’ll do whatever we
like. We may attend the collective or not.’

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.520
A kind of a ego.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:10.929
Please be careful. Christ has clearly said
‘First will be the last.’ And I’ve seen

00:28:10.929 --> 00:28:21.570
so many of them, just getting out like that,
even I don’t know how they get out. In such

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:31.940
stupid ways that unimaginable for anyone.
Like one gentleman in Italy was an old Sahaja

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:38.280
Yogi just got up and said: ‘I am Maha Mataji.’
Everyone started looking at him. ‘What do

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:50.090
you mean?’ ‘I am Maha Mataji and I’m
going to do all this myself.’ So they said,

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:55.720
‘Alright, so we are going out of ashram.’
‘No, no, no, I can’t manage the ashram,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:02.150
I’m getting out.’ And he went and stayed
with someone, that lady, who heard against

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:12.570
me and got cancer and died.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.059
In the collectivity supposing you have one
problem, another one has some problem. It

00:29:17.059 --> 00:29:30.750
just works out, balances. As one finger is
cut out, it is useless or a nail which is

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:41.260
taken out is useless. It dies. So that is
how we are organizing our spiritual death

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.600
and ultimately I don’t know what else. And
then they come back that ‘Mother I have

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.260
got now these troubles so I have come back,
I was out of Sahaja Yoga for three years.’

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:59.200
I say: ‘What do you mean, out of Sahaja
Yoga?’ ‘I didn’t attend any collective

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:06.670
programme.’ I am thinking of the collectivity
of the whole world, that’s my vision, and

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:15.290
if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective who is
going to be collective? Who is going to fulfill

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:22.559
my vision?

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:31.580
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja
Yogis, must attend the programme. And the

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:43.520
second thing is that there was a little problem
of generosity of people. Of course that’s

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:53.790
also is a character of Mahalaxshmi, She’s
very generous. And when you are generous in

00:30:53.790 --> 00:31:02.450
giving vibrations and looking after people,
this and that, then Mahalaxshmi’s principle

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:09.140
works out. But Mahalaxshmi doesn’t give
money to people who are miserly, will never

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:21.460
give. They may have money in the bank but
they can never enjoy. So if there is need

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:27.059
people have to give money to Sahaja Yoga.
I have been supplying lot of money, as you

00:31:27.059 --> 00:31:31.420
know, from the very beginning. Those who are
early Sahaja Yogis will know how much I have

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:40.390
been able to pay. But now we are growing and
everybody should know that we have to pay.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:47.190
After all this is our responsibility. Where
are we going to spend our money, in what?

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.970
I mean my family feels that, that what, whatever
money I’m spending for Sahaja Yoga is the

00:31:51.970 --> 00:32:02.340
best. They get punyas, is the best for them.
Only with punyas you get more wealth, health

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:13.150
and prosperity. If you do not have punyas
you cannot get it. It will come and go away.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:21.140
It will disappear, into thin air.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:32.420
So I was surprised that people are not generous.
We have to know that we are so much better

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:42.679
off people than many others. Like the Eastern
Bloc people are not so good in money matters

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:48.500
just now. I’m not saying that we have to
help them but we have to think and we send

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:55.540
something for them as presents. Can we do
something for them? The matter has the value

00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:05.000
which is again Mahakali’s power. Is the
power of Mahakali, that the matter carries

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:15.250
the love. Expresses.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:23.830
So many times I have seen how, very sweetly,
they gave me something. I really don’t take

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:31.740
anything and I don’t need anything but certain
things which show so such concern, such understanding,

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:46.080
such love. How will you express your love?
To those people who’re so far away. You

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:57.770
just try, try to give, try to give for Sahaja
Yoga also and you’ll be amazed how it will

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.070
work out.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:09.990
For collectivity we have to know that Shri
Bhairavanath and Shri Hanumana and Shri Ganesha,

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:17.850
these three principles that work within us,
all of them have parallel work to do, parallel

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:26.800
work, they do not interfere for each other.
But if it comes to help they go all out, there’s

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:35.000
no quarrel. No quarrel between the two, no.
If Hanuman needs Bhairava, he is there, if

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.940
Bhairava needs Hanumana he is there, all out.
So this collectivity comes only by understanding

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:52.010
one thing – what a great work we are doing
today, people are not conscious of that, they

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:59.490
take it just by the way. In the war you have
seen how people fight, even if they have the

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:10.550
fear of dying. Formerly nobody was paid also
in the military. But they went and fought,

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:16.280
maybe for their country, for anything. And
they used to join together to fight, they

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:22.300
allowed themselves to be killed, they helped
each other, they did this, all these qualities

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:28.560
are there when we want to hate someone. But
when we want to love someone why shouldn’t

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:36.800
we help, those qualities emerging out of us.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:46.990
These are the qualities of Mahakali because
She is the expert of war affairs. She’s

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:54.410
the One who makes people work and She’s
the One who makes them fight because is the

00:35:54.410 --> 00:36:03.080
desire. They have nothing there, just the
desire to do something and then they join

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:14.160
together and then the Mahasaraswati helps
them to act but first the desire is so strong.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.510
Now the desire has to be very very strong
within us that we have to be for the emancipation

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:24.540
of the whole world, we are the people, we
are the special people, we are in the (foundation?).

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:33.820
Nothing else is more important than our own
personality being completely dedicated for

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:38.260
Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:50.800
This desire has to be extremely strong and
very pure. Those actually desire it, actually,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.130
they get their Realization like that, they
reach their depth like that and they enjoy

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:06.880
doing work of Sah… they all the time they
enjoy it, for them nothing is more important.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.040
As we say in, there’s a saying that when
you get the re…water of Ganges to drink,

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:23.619
why should you take water from dirty, er,
rivers? So the whole attention is that side,

00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:29.230
the all the joy you get out of this romance
and this love, and this and that, becomes

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:38.170
zero before it because it’s Nirananda. Only
joy. In the marriage you see wife says like

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:48.820
this, says that, er, all this is so conditioning.
Any, any joy. You have different joys on different

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:55.170
centers, they are all given by Mahakali, but
the greatest of all you have got after Realization

00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:03.680
is the Nirananda, that state you must reach,
to Nirananda state. If you are in that state

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:13.950
of Nirananda then all other these pleasures
and joys are zero. I mean so many people who

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.470
told me they were very fond of cricket in
India, they said, ‘Mother, we don’t see

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.730
nowadays cricket.’ I said ‘Why?’ ‘(As?)
the enjoyment is not there now, it’s a sort

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:30.660
of, that enjoyment is lost.’ Otherwise Indians
are mad after cricket. See even in the forest

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.520
if you go they’ll be listening to the cricket.
It’s a game played by English, who are not

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:42.750
so much interested but Indians are. And now
if you ask them they say ‘No, we’re not

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:43.970
interested (now?).’

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:49.550
So many people who used to read seven, eight
newspapers say ‘We never read newspapers,

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:55.300
never good news, finished.’ And still they
are managing because the whole focus of your

00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:02.109
attention is now on Sahaja Yoga because you
only enjoy Sahaja Yoga. You like to meet Sahaja

00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:10.690
Yogis, you have to be with Sahaja Yogis. We
had a puja in England, it was raining and

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:21.470
quite a vibrant puja of Shri Ganesha. But
nobody was bothered. It started pouring down

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:27.410
through the, er, pendal they had put up, nobody
was bothered. All right, water has come, let

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:32.840
the water pass this way, we’ll sit that
side. Everybody had just, eh, because first

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:42.119
thing was to enjoy. They didn’t want to
give up enjoyment at any cost. And it continued,

00:39:42.119 --> 00:39:49.980
the whole night. One was worried because somebody
has threatened that the police will come.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:56.530
I made the police sleep also and the man who
was to report also was sleeping. So the whole

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:01.010
night we enjoyed ourselves.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:08.730
Now this enjoyment cannot come to you if you
do not have purity of your mind. Nirananda.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:20.740
You can get other anands of other, other things.
Other, other chakras. How to bring the purity.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:31.980
Just by developing thoughtless awareness and
looking at things without thinking. For that

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:39.190
you have to be collective. If you are collective,
I am there, wherever you are collective, wherever

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:47.530
you gather, I am there and nothing gives me
greater pleasure to hear that all of you are

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.830
attending this programme.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:57.950
You’ll be amazed that in Australia we have
so many centers in every, every city but they

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:14.320
all attend the programmes of collectivity
because they know collectivity is the ocean

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:27.119
of nourishment. This is the simplest thing
we have to do, but the bhoots are much more

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:40.150
collective. Much more collective. Bhoots can
go to such a length of fraternity that you’ll

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.050
be amazed.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:54.270
There was a lady in France only. She was an
old lady and her daughter was in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:42:00.500
She had become absolutely mad so she put her
in the, I mean absolutely bhootish, and so

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:07.609
she put her in a elderly home. And in the
elderly home she only knew how to go to church

00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:14.940
on Sundays, she would dress up and go to church,
that’s only sensible thing she used to do.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:21.960
So she put her in the thing and there was
a church, and she told me this, her daughter

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:28.950
told me that it is very amazing that all of
them get up in the morning, dress up well

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:35.320
and go to church and in the, inside the church
there are graves of people who have died,

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:44.270
out of those, I mean, half-mad or full-mad
elderly people. Otherwise they did not know

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:49.220
even how to wear their dresses, they didn’t
know how to eat their food, they didn’t

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:54.760
know anything but when it came to going to
church to that bhootish place where all the

00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.770
bhoots were there, they all would get up in
the morning, dress up properly and go to the

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:07.540
church, sit down, sing hymns and come back.
As if like possessions. Such a fraternity

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:16.680
of bhoots there is. As soon as one bhoot comes
in, one bhoot came now recently from Australia.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:23.530
Now he is gathering all the bhoots round here.
Even to Pune there he gathered, all the bhoots,

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:29.619
immediately. Then he came here, now he’s
gathering those bhoots. People are getting

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:35.109
friendly with him. Exactly who are bhoots
you can make it out by just seeing a bhoot

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:41.590
sitting there and who is sitting next to that
person. They are so attracted like a magnet,

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:47.310
well the magnet is the quality of Mahakali.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:57.280
Bhoots know me better than anybody else can
know because they know my past, they are in

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:05.700
the past. And they know who has got bhoots
and how they attract each other, and how they

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:18.170
act on a bhootish person. That is why the
positive collectivity has to be there. But

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:25.410
when it comes to positivity they do not get
collective. All those who do not get collective

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:34.760
will gradually go into the fraternity of bhoots
because today we are dealing about Mahakali.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.609
She is the One who knows everything about
these bhootish things, she’s in charge,

00:44:39.609 --> 00:44:46.220
I mean. She’s the Lord of all these bhoots
and She knows and She looks after then and

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:52.400
She manages them. But where’s, (inaudible
word?) want to go into that realm, what has

00:44:52.400 --> 00:45:02.240
She to do? She has locked them up on one side
but Sahaja Yogis want to go there, just enter

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:10.550
through back doors into that area, what can
you do?

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:14.810
Of course She protects, She doesn’t want
anyone to go there, She’s just kept them

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:25.930
out and told the bhoots not to come this side,
but Sahaja Yogis only go there. That’s been

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:26.930
reported.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:35.690
Under these circumstances, Sahaja Yoga has
gone very far, very much in so many other

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:44.420
countries. In France you have seen yesterday
how this ananda shakti of the Mother acted

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:51.210
on people. ‘ It was wonderful to see that,
everybody came to me and they were full of

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:56.990
smiles, I have never seen any French woman
of that age smiling, never, no question, even

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:02.430
if you tickled them, even if you certify that
this is a joke they’ll not smile like that.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:10.780
I’ve never seen their teeth. Yesterday the
whole face was lit up, so many of them, something

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:20.960
so miraculous it was. This anandini shakti
of Mahakali was acting so beautifully yesterday

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.410
and you are the people who will now guide
or misguide them.

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:36.960
If you become, all of you become, higher personalities,
if you become collective all of you, and if

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:46.090
you become generous, and if you become absolutely
pure, they will say ‘Now look at these people,

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:53.540
how beautiful they look.’ You already look
very beautiful, your faces shine, but it will

00:46:53.540 --> 00:47:08.700
all disappear and the effects of disappearance
are not very simple. So be careful, I of course

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:23.540
bless you, with all the qualities of Bhairava,
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahakali

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:28.000
and He is the One who is running up and down,
morning till evening every time, specially

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:38.849
in the night He is working so very hard killing
these horrible rakshasas, this, that, and

00:47:38.849 --> 00:47:48.050
achieving such results. We have to join Him,
all of us, and work it out.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.840
May God Bless You.
