WEBVTT

00:03.030 --> 00:15.950
We have had Bhairava Puja in Belgium and now
I thought today let us have Mahakali Puja

00:15.950 --> 00:27.440
because yesterday’s experience, last night’s
experience, was the work of Mahakali.

00:27.440 --> 00:41.640
She has a double role all the time, she’s
at two extremes. On one side she is full of

00:41.640 --> 00:52.710
joy, giver of joy, she’s very happy when
she sees her disciple are joyous. Joy is her

00:52.710 --> 01:01.069
own quality, is her energy, and yesterday
you must have been amazed to see so many middle-aged

01:01.069 --> 01:12.600
ladies of France smiling and laughing. I’d
never seen them smiling; it’s very surprising

01:12.600 --> 01:21.289
how they were so joyous and so very happy
and this is the energy of Mahakali that gives

01:21.289 --> 01:27.640
you all that joy after Realization and the
joy you enjoy among yourselves, all these

01:27.640 --> 01:36.259
are the qualities of Mahakali and when they
will read out the names of Mahakali you will

01:36.259 --> 01:49.929
know how her powers manifest in Sahaja Yoga
and how it has helped you all to get drenched

01:49.929 --> 01:51.469
into the Ocean of Joy.

01:51.469 --> 02:12.730
To
begin with I have to tell you one thing that
Mahakali Puja, when you are doing, you have

02:12.730 --> 02:24.420
to feel a joy within yourself, and joy from
other Sahaja Yogis. If you, if you cannot

02:24.420 --> 02:32.750
feel that, that means you are not yet grown
and there’s some problem, maybe with your

02:32.750 --> 02:37.400
parents, maybe with your children, maybe it’s
family, with your country, whatever it is

02:37.400 --> 02:42.310
but there’s some sort of a conditioning
which is working out that doesn’t give you

02:42.310 --> 02:55.819
that joy. And to grow into Sahaja Yoga is
very important, which I think people don’t

02:55.819 --> 03:01.280
understand, even if they live in ashrams,
they don’t understand one thing, that you

03:01.280 --> 03:12.860
have to be collective. If you are not collective
then you are thrown out, gradually. Now this

03:12.860 --> 03:21.890
Mahakali power has got seven strings you can
say this, and these strings are there to throw

03:21.890 --> 03:27.510
you out into collective subconscious (next
couple of words inaudible). Like as in the

03:27.510 --> 03:35.019
sitar you have seen for the resonance, there
are other strings also. So once you start

03:35.019 --> 03:42.530
getting out of the collectivity it is the
Mahakali Herself, picks you out and starts

03:42.530 --> 03:53.950
throwing you out, slowly slowly to the subconscious
area and where you just disappear. And all

03:53.950 --> 04:02.180
kinds of problems start, I have seen this
happening in every country, that people who

04:02.180 --> 04:12.180
do not attend the collective meditation. For
France I have the same report and I think

04:12.180 --> 04:17.390
the people who do not grow will be thrown
out.

04:17.390 --> 04:27.789
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action,
as the Mahakali has a double action. She’s

04:27.789 --> 04:33.539
extremely loving, full of joy, full of happiness
and She’s the one who’s extremely cruel,

04:33.539 --> 04:38.710
wrathful, She’s the one who’s the slayer
of all the demons and the evil, and those

04:38.710 --> 04:46.870
people who try to do evil. So once you are
thrown out into the left side then you can

04:46.870 --> 04:51.460
imagine, you can develop any kind of left-side
diseases to begin with, Mooladhara diseases

04:51.460 --> 05:00.990
are the worst, you develop diseases like mellitus,
this, er, er, you must have heard of the disabilities

05:00.990 --> 05:07.930
caused by the muscles getting degenerated.
All muscular degeneration comes from this

05:07.930 --> 05:19.430
problem. So at any cost that must be avoided.
But if you are not in the collective, if you

05:19.430 --> 05:27.020
do not understand the collective, and if you
are out of the collective you’ll be surprised

05:27.020 --> 05:34.310
that negative forces will join together and
they’ll pull you out. So this is one of

05:34.310 --> 05:44.900
the things that happens, so be very careful
that don’t avoid the collective programmes.

05:44.900 --> 05:56.780
The, another problem about Mahakali is that,
that She’s the one who gives you the feeling

05:56.780 --> 06:12.139
for your wife, for your husband, She is the
one. Now there also, the same problem. If

06:12.139 --> 06:24.009
both of them are alright, She’s alright
but if She finds any one of them going astray

06:24.009 --> 06:29.819
She’ll throw that person out and out and
out and the, another person, if that person

06:29.819 --> 06:35.039
is attached to that person also will be thrown
out. So this business of falling in love,

06:35.039 --> 06:39.050
this nonsense that we have here, that you
fall in love, but the word is all right because

06:39.050 --> 06:46.720
you fall really in love. It’s a real falling
happens. So what happens when you start falling

06:46.720 --> 06:53.150
in love, there’s a kind of a maya of this
Mahakali and you just get infatuated, your

06:53.150 --> 06:58.639
ego gets pampered, or something like that,
or you have certain ideas of a wife or something

06:58.639 --> 07:03.539
and then you think ‘Oh, that’s the one
for me.’

07:03.539 --> 07:09.129
So in these cases only two things can happen;
either you can be lost completely because

07:09.129 --> 07:17.199
of your wife or your husband whom you adore
and admire and you, you’ve finished, I mean

07:17.199 --> 07:23.129
your personality is finished. Or else, the
another thing which is even more serious is

07:23.129 --> 07:27.759
that, that you’ll completely break forever
and hate each other. That’s why they say

07:27.759 --> 07:37.470
that there’s a love and hate relationship.
How can love be hate? But it becomes, because

07:37.470 --> 07:45.580
of the, this quality of the Goddess that She
is on one side extremely loving, extremely

07:45.580 --> 07:55.870
kind, extremely soft, she goes up to a point.
And then She throws you on the other side,

07:55.870 --> 08:00.479
and that is why in these countries where people
always fall in love, you see, they don’t

08:00.479 --> 08:06.789
marry otherwise, unless and until they have
fallen in love. In that they cross all the

08:06.789 --> 08:13.289
maryadas also. In falling in love they will
marry somebody who is already married or who

08:13.289 --> 08:23.599
is, they’ll carry on with somebody who is
not yet divorced or also they will have marriages,

08:23.599 --> 08:29.530
er, among themselves in the same household
or something. All kinds of things they do

08:29.530 --> 08:35.940
and the old woman marries a young man or a
young, er, old man marries a young girl, like

08:35.940 --> 08:40.860
that, all nonsensical things, without any
maryadas. And they do not stick together,

08:40.860 --> 08:49.380
they have no maryadas. To marry is to create
a maryada, maryada of your behaviour and this

08:49.380 --> 08:56.020
is the maryada which, if you do not keep,
er, keep, then this Mahakali gets into it.

08:56.020 --> 09:01.030
So first of all one has to be collective,
the ones who are not collective, the ones

09:01.030 --> 09:06.800
who do not attend every time a collective
programme. You might give suggestions, that

09:06.800 --> 09:09.580
you would like to come for such and such thing.

09:09.580 --> 09:15.600
For example, I have already explained, that
you shouldn’t talk, put my, there are so

09:15.600 --> 09:20.150
many tapes which they have not, never heard.
List…let them listen to my tape then go

09:20.150 --> 09:25.600
into meditation and then do the aarti and
finish it off. Because these tapes are to

09:25.600 --> 09:33.720
be heard again and again. Now those who get
any questions out of those tapes can, next

09:33.720 --> 09:38.750
time, discuss it before starting the tapes.
That’s a very good thing and that works.

09:38.750 --> 09:47.170
In India nobody speaks, they just put my tapes
on or show my video, after that they just

09:47.170 --> 09:54.810
have meditation and aarti. Finished. After
that nobody talks. But before starting it,

09:54.810 --> 10:02.190
they do it is to talk to each other and discuss
the problems or discuss anything that they

10:02.190 --> 10:10.080
felt about the previous programme. Because
you have not come here to marry someone or

10:10.080 --> 10:16.590
to fall in love into something. You have not
come here to get after some woman because

10:16.590 --> 10:21.250
she’s your wife or some man because he’s
your husband. You have had so many husbands

10:21.250 --> 10:31.470
and wives in previous lives. But you have
come here for your ascent; and if you have

10:31.470 --> 10:37.770
come here for your ascent you have to keep
a watch. How is your mind working? Supposing

10:37.770 --> 10:42.870
I say that you should have good married life,
of course, I do say, you should have good

10:42.870 --> 10:50.860
married life. But not at the cost of losing
your ascent. It has happened with people,

10:50.860 --> 11:01.600
we have lost a complete, I should say, a city
like that. Such stupidity came, comes up over

11:01.600 --> 11:08.260
people. So be careful not to get lost, you
have not come here to have only a happy married

11:08.260 --> 11:16.180
life but happy married life is just one step.
But if that step is taking you away from the

11:16.180 --> 11:25.140
real path of your ascent is better to be careful.

11:25.140 --> 11:31.860
Also we must understand the innocence means
purity, purity of thought. As I explained

11:31.860 --> 11:37.290
yesterday I hope you understood the meaning
of purity. Purity is to be understood much

11:37.290 --> 11:52.680
more by Europeans. Very important. Specially
French. Because the whole society is suffering.

11:52.680 --> 12:00.510
Society can only be pure if the family life
is pure. Not only that but your relations

12:00.510 --> 12:09.010
with each other are pure. Like I was told
that somebody fell in love in Ganapatipule.

12:09.010 --> 12:16.730
I mean you go for a pilgrimage. It’s like
you have to go to buy a sari and you end up

12:16.730 --> 12:26.200
with a shaving stick. It’s that stupid.
You are coming to Ganapatipule for a, for

12:26.200 --> 12:40.810
what? You are coming there for your ascent,
it’s a pilgrimage. But in the pilgrimage

12:40.810 --> 12:47.800
I’ve never heard anybody falls in love with
each other and goes to marriage. So this bhoot

12:47.800 --> 12:53.610
of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja
Yoga, that is one of the biggest loads. And,

12:53.610 --> 13:06.660
and must understand that purity means chastity.
Innocence means chastity, not only physical

13:06.660 --> 13:17.020
also mental chastity. You have to have mental
chastity, if you don’t have mental chastity

13:17.020 --> 13:19.870
you cannot ascend.

13:19.870 --> 13:31.470
Actually in the West it is more mental that
physical, is a fact. And that’s why their

13:31.470 --> 13:36.420
brains (inaudible?) have gone off. And they
are becoming just like, I think, potatoes

13:36.420 --> 13:42.270
now, I think. Because if you go on mentally
imagining and playing around and working it

13:42.270 --> 13:47.670
out this way, it’s going to be absolutely
dangerous because it’s all imagination,

13:47.670 --> 13:53.540
it has nothing to do with reality. The more
you get into this kind of a nonsense the more

13:53.540 --> 13:59.460
you become away from reality. That never means
you should be dry, it never means you should

13:59.460 --> 14:08.530
be, er, negligent of your responsibility,
does not mean. As I said, the sap…(Shri

14:08.530 --> 14:33.060
Mataji speaks aside in Hindi). As I’ve said
that the sap in the tree rises, all right?

14:33.060 --> 14:40.850
Then it purifies, it nourishes every part
of the plant separately in a different way.

14:40.850 --> 14:46.120
Like it’s a mother, so mother, father, is
a father, sister, is a sister, brother, is

14:46.120 --> 14:54.410
a sister (Shri Mataji corrects), brother is
a brother. The brother-sister relations cannot

14:54.410 --> 15:08.540
become husband-wife relations. How can it
be? (Speaks aside again in Hindi). Now what

15:08.540 --> 15:15.120
happens really is that such a confusion in
the mind and it has created tremendous problems

15:15.120 --> 15:21.760
for us.

15:21.760 --> 15:30.210
Then the sap nourishes all these things and
comes back. It doesn’t get attached to something:

15:30.210 --> 15:35.960
‘Oh, she’s my wife so the first priority
is my wife.’ Because I’ve said, of course,

15:35.960 --> 15:41.990
family life has to be all right, you must
look after your family life. But that doesn’t

15:41.990 --> 15:46.770
mean that you make everything suffer, that
doesn’t mean that your ascent should be

15:46.770 --> 15:49.560
finished. Cannot be that.

15:49.560 --> 15:55.750
You are not like ordinary people, you are
saints and for the saints the main thing is

15:55.750 --> 16:03.820
their ascent, not their family life, not their
material possessions, nothing. Nor their children,

16:03.820 --> 16:16.570
but their ascent, once they ascend everything
will ascend with it.

16:16.570 --> 16:26.140
Now the understanding of chastity should be
there. It can come to you very easily if you

16:26.140 --> 16:34.210
ascend, it’s such a vicious circle. It is
such a vicious circle. Now first of all you

16:34.210 --> 16:42.820
get your Realization, all right. Now you must
know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali

16:42.820 --> 16:52.350
shakti because she’s the primordial. Mahakali
shakti is the primordial shakti within us.

16:52.350 --> 17:00.400
And is the Kundalini is the Mahakali shakti.
And she remains as a virgin within you. Means

17:00.400 --> 17:06.079
She’s purity, She has a power to purify.

17:06.079 --> 17:19.220
All that happens when you get your Realization.
She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects

17:19.220 --> 17:30.750
on you. Now the one who’s sitting there
is Shri Ganesh. Now people don’t understand

17:30.750 --> 17:45.780
what is innocence is. Shri Ganesha is sitting
there and He is the one who resides on mooladhara,

17:45.780 --> 17:52.930
even over his Mother because He’s like a
guard, and He’s the one who tells whether

17:52.930 --> 18:01.960
She can ascend or not. Unless and until He
gives permission She cannot ascend. So Shri

18:01.960 --> 18:17.440
Ganesha gives the ascending sort of, er, OK,
alright, you can rise. And he stops all his

18:17.440 --> 18:27.560
work. You have seen th… Me, sitting for
hours together. I don’t have to go even

18:27.560 --> 18:35.030
to the bathroom or anywhere because Shri Ganesha
stops all his work. He’s only worried now

18:35.030 --> 18:45.440
about the ascent and on every chakra he checks
your purity, and then accordingly the Kundalini

18:45.440 --> 18:55.440
tries to purify (you?). But when it reaches
the mental level, mental level has all these

18:55.440 --> 19:02.970
funny ideas of romance, this nonsense, that
nonsense. I was surprised the other day, there

19:02.970 --> 19:09.250
was a girl who was having a trouble with her
husband of expressing her love to her husband

19:09.250 --> 19:15.980
after marriage; before marriage she was all
right. So I told her: ‘Read some book where

19:15.980 --> 19:24.470
they have described the romance between husband
and wife’. So she said, ‘There is no book

19:24.470 --> 19:33.120
I have known.’ Then I asked one professor
to find out, he said there’s no such book.

19:33.120 --> 19:41.250
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the
marriage. But also with maryadas, not at the

19:41.250 --> 19:50.350
cost of Sahaja Yoga, not at the cost, cost
of your ascent. So all these ideas people

19:50.350 --> 19:55.750
have in the West, I know you are so much conditioned
about it. So, you say now let us see, this

19:55.750 --> 20:02.280
is some (? inaudible word) after all, we have
to give all the benefit to them.

20:02.280 --> 20:10.730
Now we select people, we do everything. Is
all the work of Mahakali because you have

20:10.730 --> 20:17.130
to work on the vibrations, it’s all the
work of Mahakali. And after marriages also

20:17.130 --> 20:32.070
some marriages do fail. The reason being they
do not know what is the purpose of their marriages.

20:32.070 --> 20:41.230
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali
is that She is purity. Absolute purity. And

20:41.230 --> 20:53.370
that purity if we cannot imbibe within us,
we cannot be Sahaja Yogis. Now this mind is

20:53.370 --> 20:57.800
so much conditioned, I know. Our children
will be much better off than ourselves. Then

20:57.800 --> 21:05.540
they won’t have these conditionings as we
have had. And so many problems can be just

21:05.540 --> 21:10.040
avoided if you really become pure people.

21:10.040 --> 21:15.240
I see in the other society in which I move,
nobody seems to be safe, somebody’s wife

21:15.240 --> 21:20.580
is running with somebody’s husband, somebody’s
daughter is running with somebody’s father,

21:20.580 --> 21:26.280
somebody’s running, a boy running with somebody’s
mother. Next day you find somebody else standing

21:26.280 --> 21:32.400
there husband and wife. Or sometimes it’s
so biz…funny that you can’t believe it,

21:32.400 --> 21:40.810
how can it be? And everybody’s in danger.
A man goes to the house, he finds his wife

21:40.810 --> 21:48.220
run away with another man. Or a man goes for
his work, he’s run away with another woman.

21:48.220 --> 21:57.470
So the, She, She’s the one, She gives you
stithi, the state. Stithi means consolidation.

21:57.470 --> 22:09.700
Without your proper consolidation into your
purity, not into your romantic life, you cannot

22:09.700 --> 22:19.650
rise. Like when we make the aeroplane, first
we have to consolidate it. Fix it up properly,

22:19.650 --> 22:30.240
work it out, so that when it goes in the air
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

22:30.240 --> 22:41.130
In the same way when we are ascending Shri
Ganesha does that, he just stops the action

22:41.130 --> 22:45.800
of excretion completely and the ascent starts.

22:45.800 --> 22:53.510
They are doing their work all right, despite
the fact they have been insulted, they have

22:53.510 --> 23:00.150
been neglected, we have misbehaved, whatever
we might have done, they are doing their jobs

23:00.150 --> 23:05.990
alright. We can see it, so many people getting
their Realization. But what are we doing about

23:05.990 --> 23:19.590
it? We cannot be even collective, we cannot
attend collective things. And look at them

23:19.590 --> 23:25.620
how generous they are, they are extremely
collective, they are extremely collective,

23:25.620 --> 23:38.450
to such an extent to somebody supposing worships
Shri Krishna. His heart will catch. Why? Because

23:38.450 --> 23:43.720
you must also worship Shiva.

23:43.720 --> 23:53.330
They are so collective and so much connected
with Me. So they are all collective, in the

23:53.330 --> 24:01.809
same way you are also devas, you also should
be collective. As soon as you become collective

24:01.809 --> 24:08.470
all these nonsensical things will drop out.
All these ideas will drop out. You do not

24:08.470 --> 24:15.030
become collective because you have not dropped
out all these things, or else you are afraid

24:15.030 --> 24:25.380
of dropping them out. So let us know what
is our purpose (is?), our purpose is to ascend.

24:25.380 --> 24:29.580
And what is the Mahakali power is doing for
us.

24:29.580 --> 24:38.340
She is giving you your ascent through Kundalini.
She is purify; She’s giving you all the

24:38.340 --> 24:51.680
powers. She is protecting you all the time,
She is giving you joy. But what are we doing

24:51.680 --> 25:05.320
for Her? Her only, only desire is that my
children should be saintly, that they should

25:05.320 --> 25:14.000
have beautiful qualities of a saint. That
he doesn’t fall at every woman, fall at

25:14.000 --> 25:24.320
every man. It’s not so cheap, you see. And
mentally specially, I mean if the Sahasrara

25:24.320 --> 25:36.600
is spoilt how can Sahaja Yoga work out? The
whole play is of the Sahasrara. And that purity

25:36.600 --> 25:45.710
should manifest. Through you we are going
to change the world. Through no-one else.

25:45.710 --> 25:49.770
The Sahaja Yogis who are going to change the
world.

25:49.770 --> 25:58.730
Now look at the generosity, when my body is
so generous. Yesterday one lady came, I think

25:58.730 --> 26:07.070
she, she had a very bad liver. She came downstairs
and I, my liver started pumping vibrations,

26:07.070 --> 26:12.610
terrible. She had a very bad liver though;
she had taken drugs, I mean she had taken

26:12.610 --> 26:19.600
drugs and all that suffering was done to me,
by this liver of mine. It didn’t think that

26:19.600 --> 26:27.230
‘Oh Mother, she’s come all the way out
suffering’ so started just pumping for that

26:27.230 --> 26:37.270
woman. So generous it is. And they are so
generous themselves the way they bestow blessings

26:37.270 --> 26:46.600
(all over?). How they are hard working, how
they are running about. What are we giving

26:46.600 --> 26:47.340
them?

26:47.340 --> 26:56.150
They give us joy, they look after us, they
look after our children, they look after everything,

26:56.150 --> 27:02.300
they manage everything. Now what are we doing
for them?

27:02.300 --> 27:04.570
Also I’ve heard that people don’t help
when they have to do postering, they have

27:04.570 --> 27:16.320
to do, very few people come up. This is being
ungrateful, very ungrateful to those. All

27:16.320 --> 27:25.020
the deities are present when you are having
those collective programmes. And surprisingly

27:25.020 --> 27:32.570
the old Sahaja Yogis are more difficult than
the new ones. I mean this I just, surprising.

27:32.570 --> 27:39.270
I mean are they becoming now out of date or
something? Christ has said ‘First will be

27:39.270 --> 27:46.530
the last’. I hope that’s not going to
happen. Sort of a confidence they develop,

27:46.530 --> 27:54.080
‘Oh, we are old Sahaja Yogis.’ We have
had a horrible results in London of this consciousness

27:54.080 --> 27:58.760
that ‘We are old, we’ll do whatever we
like. We may attend the collective or not.’

27:58.760 --> 28:01.520
A kind of a ego.

28:01.520 --> 28:10.929
Please be careful. Christ has clearly said
‘First will be the last.’ And I’ve seen

28:10.929 --> 28:21.570
so many of them, just getting out like that,
even I don’t know how they get out. In such

28:21.570 --> 28:31.940
stupid ways that unimaginable for anyone.
Like one gentleman in Italy was an old Sahaja

28:31.940 --> 28:38.280
Yogi just got up and said: ‘I am Maha Mataji.’
Everyone started looking at him. ‘What do

28:38.280 --> 28:50.090
you mean?’ ‘I am Maha Mataji and I’m
going to do all this myself.’ So they said,

28:50.090 --> 28:55.720
‘Alright, so we are going out of ashram.’
‘No, no, no, I can’t manage the ashram,

28:55.720 --> 29:02.150
I’m getting out.’ And he went and stayed
with someone, that lady, who heard against

29:02.150 --> 29:12.570
me and got cancer and died.

29:12.570 --> 29:17.059
In the collectivity supposing you have one
problem, another one has some problem. It

29:17.059 --> 29:30.750
just works out, balances. As one finger is
cut out, it is useless or a nail which is

29:30.750 --> 29:41.260
taken out is useless. It dies. So that is
how we are organizing our spiritual death

29:41.260 --> 29:46.600
and ultimately I don’t know what else. And
then they come back that ‘Mother I have

29:46.600 --> 29:51.260
got now these troubles so I have come back,
I was out of Sahaja Yoga for three years.’

29:51.260 --> 29:59.200
I say: ‘What do you mean, out of Sahaja
Yoga?’ ‘I didn’t attend any collective

29:59.200 --> 30:06.670
programme.’ I am thinking of the collectivity
of the whole world, that’s my vision, and

30:06.670 --> 30:15.290
if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective who is
going to be collective? Who is going to fulfill

30:15.290 --> 30:22.559
my vision?

30:22.559 --> 30:31.580
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja
Yogis, must attend the programme. And the

30:31.580 --> 30:43.520
second thing is that there was a little problem
of generosity of people. Of course that’s

30:43.520 --> 30:53.790
also is a character of Mahalaxshmi, She’s
very generous. And when you are generous in

30:53.790 --> 31:02.450
giving vibrations and looking after people,
this and that, then Mahalaxshmi’s principle

31:02.450 --> 31:09.140
works out. But Mahalaxshmi doesn’t give
money to people who are miserly, will never

31:09.140 --> 31:21.460
give. They may have money in the bank but
they can never enjoy. So if there is need

31:21.460 --> 31:27.059
people have to give money to Sahaja Yoga.
I have been supplying lot of money, as you

31:27.059 --> 31:31.420
know, from the very beginning. Those who are
early Sahaja Yogis will know how much I have

31:31.420 --> 31:40.390
been able to pay. But now we are growing and
everybody should know that we have to pay.

31:40.390 --> 31:47.190
After all this is our responsibility. Where
are we going to spend our money, in what?

31:47.190 --> 31:51.970
I mean my family feels that, that what, whatever
money I’m spending for Sahaja Yoga is the

31:51.970 --> 32:02.340
best. They get punyas, is the best for them.
Only with punyas you get more wealth, health

32:02.340 --> 32:13.150
and prosperity. If you do not have punyas
you cannot get it. It will come and go away.

32:13.150 --> 32:21.140
It will disappear, into thin air.

32:21.140 --> 32:32.420
So I was surprised that people are not generous.
We have to know that we are so much better

32:32.420 --> 32:42.679
off people than many others. Like the Eastern
Bloc people are not so good in money matters

32:42.679 --> 32:48.500
just now. I’m not saying that we have to
help them but we have to think and we send

32:48.500 --> 32:55.540
something for them as presents. Can we do
something for them? The matter has the value

32:55.540 --> 33:05.000
which is again Mahakali’s power. Is the
power of Mahakali, that the matter carries

33:05.000 --> 33:15.250
the love. Expresses.

33:15.250 --> 33:23.830
So many times I have seen how, very sweetly,
they gave me something. I really don’t take

33:23.830 --> 33:31.740
anything and I don’t need anything but certain
things which show so such concern, such understanding,

33:31.740 --> 33:46.080
such love. How will you express your love?
To those people who’re so far away. You

33:46.080 --> 33:57.770
just try, try to give, try to give for Sahaja
Yoga also and you’ll be amazed how it will

33:57.770 --> 34:00.070
work out.

34:00.070 --> 34:09.990
For collectivity we have to know that Shri
Bhairavanath and Shri Hanumana and Shri Ganesha,

34:09.990 --> 34:17.850
these three principles that work within us,
all of them have parallel work to do, parallel

34:17.850 --> 34:26.800
work, they do not interfere for each other.
But if it comes to help they go all out, there’s

34:26.800 --> 34:35.000
no quarrel. No quarrel between the two, no.
If Hanuman needs Bhairava, he is there, if

34:35.000 --> 34:44.940
Bhairava needs Hanumana he is there, all out.
So this collectivity comes only by understanding

34:44.940 --> 34:52.010
one thing – what a great work we are doing
today, people are not conscious of that, they

34:52.010 --> 34:59.490
take it just by the way. In the war you have
seen how people fight, even if they have the

34:59.490 --> 35:10.550
fear of dying. Formerly nobody was paid also
in the military. But they went and fought,

35:10.550 --> 35:16.280
maybe for their country, for anything. And
they used to join together to fight, they

35:16.280 --> 35:22.300
allowed themselves to be killed, they helped
each other, they did this, all these qualities

35:22.300 --> 35:28.560
are there when we want to hate someone. But
when we want to love someone why shouldn’t

35:28.560 --> 35:36.800
we help, those qualities emerging out of us.

35:36.800 --> 35:46.990
These are the qualities of Mahakali because
She is the expert of war affairs. She’s

35:46.990 --> 35:54.410
the One who makes people work and She’s
the One who makes them fight because is the

35:54.410 --> 36:03.080
desire. They have nothing there, just the
desire to do something and then they join

36:03.080 --> 36:14.160
together and then the Mahasaraswati helps
them to act but first the desire is so strong.

36:14.160 --> 36:19.510
Now the desire has to be very very strong
within us that we have to be for the emancipation

36:19.510 --> 36:24.540
of the whole world, we are the people, we
are the special people, we are in the (foundation?).

36:24.540 --> 36:33.820
Nothing else is more important than our own
personality being completely dedicated for

36:33.820 --> 36:38.260
Sahaja Yoga.

36:38.260 --> 36:50.800
This desire has to be extremely strong and
very pure. Those actually desire it, actually,

36:50.800 --> 36:56.130
they get their Realization like that, they
reach their depth like that and they enjoy

36:56.130 --> 37:06.880
doing work of Sah… they all the time they
enjoy it, for them nothing is more important.

37:06.880 --> 37:12.040
As we say in, there’s a saying that when
you get the re…water of Ganges to drink,

37:12.040 --> 37:23.619
why should you take water from dirty, er,
rivers? So the whole attention is that side,

37:23.619 --> 37:29.230
the all the joy you get out of this romance
and this love, and this and that, becomes

37:29.230 --> 37:38.170
zero before it because it’s Nirananda. Only
joy. In the marriage you see wife says like

37:38.170 --> 37:48.820
this, says that, er, all this is so conditioning.
Any, any joy. You have different joys on different

37:48.820 --> 37:55.170
centers, they are all given by Mahakali, but
the greatest of all you have got after Realization

37:55.170 --> 38:03.680
is the Nirananda, that state you must reach,
to Nirananda state. If you are in that state

38:03.680 --> 38:13.950
of Nirananda then all other these pleasures
and joys are zero. I mean so many people who

38:13.950 --> 38:17.470
told me they were very fond of cricket in
India, they said, ‘Mother, we don’t see

38:17.470 --> 38:21.730
nowadays cricket.’ I said ‘Why?’ ‘(As?)
the enjoyment is not there now, it’s a sort

38:21.730 --> 38:30.660
of, that enjoyment is lost.’ Otherwise Indians
are mad after cricket. See even in the forest

38:30.660 --> 38:35.520
if you go they’ll be listening to the cricket.
It’s a game played by English, who are not

38:35.520 --> 38:42.750
so much interested but Indians are. And now
if you ask them they say ‘No, we’re not

38:42.750 --> 38:43.970
interested (now?).’

38:43.970 --> 38:49.550
So many people who used to read seven, eight
newspapers say ‘We never read newspapers,

38:49.550 --> 38:55.300
never good news, finished.’ And still they
are managing because the whole focus of your

38:55.300 --> 39:02.109
attention is now on Sahaja Yoga because you
only enjoy Sahaja Yoga. You like to meet Sahaja

39:02.109 --> 39:10.690
Yogis, you have to be with Sahaja Yogis. We
had a puja in England, it was raining and

39:10.690 --> 39:21.470
quite a vibrant puja of Shri Ganesha. But
nobody was bothered. It started pouring down

39:21.470 --> 39:27.410
through the, er, pendal they had put up, nobody
was bothered. All right, water has come, let

39:27.410 --> 39:32.840
the water pass this way, we’ll sit that
side. Everybody had just, eh, because first

39:32.840 --> 39:42.119
thing was to enjoy. They didn’t want to
give up enjoyment at any cost. And it continued,

39:42.119 --> 39:49.980
the whole night. One was worried because somebody
has threatened that the police will come.

39:49.980 --> 39:56.530
I made the police sleep also and the man who
was to report also was sleeping. So the whole

39:56.530 --> 40:01.010
night we enjoyed ourselves.

40:01.010 --> 40:08.730
Now this enjoyment cannot come to you if you
do not have purity of your mind. Nirananda.

40:08.730 --> 40:20.740
You can get other anands of other, other things.
Other, other chakras. How to bring the purity.

40:20.740 --> 40:31.980
Just by developing thoughtless awareness and
looking at things without thinking. For that

40:31.980 --> 40:39.190
you have to be collective. If you are collective,
I am there, wherever you are collective, wherever

40:39.190 --> 40:47.530
you gather, I am there and nothing gives me
greater pleasure to hear that all of you are

40:47.530 --> 40:49.830
attending this programme.

40:49.830 --> 40:57.950
You’ll be amazed that in Australia we have
so many centers in every, every city but they

40:57.950 --> 41:14.320
all attend the programmes of collectivity
because they know collectivity is the ocean

41:14.320 --> 41:27.119
of nourishment. This is the simplest thing
we have to do, but the bhoots are much more

41:27.119 --> 41:40.150
collective. Much more collective. Bhoots can
go to such a length of fraternity that you’ll

41:40.150 --> 41:41.050
be amazed.

41:41.050 --> 41:54.270
There was a lady in France only. She was an
old lady and her daughter was in Sahaja Yoga.

41:54.270 --> 42:00.500
She had become absolutely mad so she put her
in the, I mean absolutely bhootish, and so

42:00.500 --> 42:07.609
she put her in a elderly home. And in the
elderly home she only knew how to go to church

42:07.609 --> 42:14.940
on Sundays, she would dress up and go to church,
that’s only sensible thing she used to do.

42:14.940 --> 42:21.960
So she put her in the thing and there was
a church, and she told me this, her daughter

42:21.960 --> 42:28.950
told me that it is very amazing that all of
them get up in the morning, dress up well

42:28.950 --> 42:35.320
and go to church and in the, inside the church
there are graves of people who have died,

42:35.320 --> 42:44.270
out of those, I mean, half-mad or full-mad
elderly people. Otherwise they did not know

42:44.270 --> 42:49.220
even how to wear their dresses, they didn’t
know how to eat their food, they didn’t

42:49.220 --> 42:54.760
know anything but when it came to going to
church to that bhootish place where all the

42:54.760 --> 43:00.770
bhoots were there, they all would get up in
the morning, dress up properly and go to the

43:00.770 --> 43:07.540
church, sit down, sing hymns and come back.
As if like possessions. Such a fraternity

43:07.540 --> 43:16.680
of bhoots there is. As soon as one bhoot comes
in, one bhoot came now recently from Australia.

43:16.680 --> 43:23.530
Now he is gathering all the bhoots round here.
Even to Pune there he gathered, all the bhoots,

43:23.530 --> 43:29.619
immediately. Then he came here, now he’s
gathering those bhoots. People are getting

43:29.619 --> 43:35.109
friendly with him. Exactly who are bhoots
you can make it out by just seeing a bhoot

43:35.109 --> 43:41.590
sitting there and who is sitting next to that
person. They are so attracted like a magnet,

43:41.590 --> 43:47.310
well the magnet is the quality of Mahakali.

43:47.310 --> 43:57.280
Bhoots know me better than anybody else can
know because they know my past, they are in

43:57.280 --> 44:05.700
the past. And they know who has got bhoots
and how they attract each other, and how they

44:05.700 --> 44:18.170
act on a bhootish person. That is why the
positive collectivity has to be there. But

44:18.170 --> 44:25.410
when it comes to positivity they do not get
collective. All those who do not get collective

44:25.410 --> 44:34.760
will gradually go into the fraternity of bhoots
because today we are dealing about Mahakali.

44:34.760 --> 44:39.609
She is the One who knows everything about
these bhootish things, she’s in charge,

44:39.609 --> 44:46.220
I mean. She’s the Lord of all these bhoots
and She knows and She looks after then and

44:46.220 --> 44:52.400
She manages them. But where’s, (inaudible
word?) want to go into that realm, what has

44:52.400 --> 45:02.240
She to do? She has locked them up on one side
but Sahaja Yogis want to go there, just enter

45:02.240 --> 45:10.550
through back doors into that area, what can
you do?

45:10.550 --> 45:14.810
Of course She protects, She doesn’t want
anyone to go there, She’s just kept them

45:14.810 --> 45:25.930
out and told the bhoots not to come this side,
but Sahaja Yogis only go there. That’s been

45:25.930 --> 45:26.930
reported.

45:26.930 --> 45:35.690
Under these circumstances, Sahaja Yoga has
gone very far, very much in so many other

45:35.690 --> 45:44.420
countries. In France you have seen yesterday
how this ananda shakti of the Mother acted

45:44.420 --> 45:51.210
on people. ‘ It was wonderful to see that,
everybody came to me and they were full of

45:51.210 --> 45:56.990
smiles, I have never seen any French woman
of that age smiling, never, no question, even

45:56.990 --> 46:02.430
if you tickled them, even if you certify that
this is a joke they’ll not smile like that.

46:02.430 --> 46:10.780
I’ve never seen their teeth. Yesterday the
whole face was lit up, so many of them, something

46:10.780 --> 46:20.960
so miraculous it was. This anandini shakti
of Mahakali was acting so beautifully yesterday

46:20.960 --> 46:26.410
and you are the people who will now guide
or misguide them.

46:26.410 --> 46:36.960
If you become, all of you become, higher personalities,
if you become collective all of you, and if

46:36.960 --> 46:46.090
you become generous, and if you become absolutely
pure, they will say ‘Now look at these people,

46:46.090 --> 46:53.540
how beautiful they look.’ You already look
very beautiful, your faces shine, but it will

46:53.540 --> 47:08.700
all disappear and the effects of disappearance
are not very simple. So be careful, I of course

47:08.700 --> 47:23.540
bless you, with all the qualities of Bhairava,
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahakali

47:23.540 --> 47:28.000
and He is the One who is running up and down,
morning till evening every time, specially

47:28.000 --> 47:38.849
in the night He is working so very hard killing
these horrible rakshasas, this, that, and

47:38.849 --> 47:48.050
achieving such results. We have to join Him,
all of us, and work it out.

47:48.960 --> 47:50.840
May God Bless You.
