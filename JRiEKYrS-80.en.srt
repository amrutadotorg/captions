00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:06,523
SIGNIFICANCE OF HALLOWEEN

2
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:12,898
IN THE TALKS OF SHRI MATAJI

3
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:27,255
Or else if you have the puja on Saturday
evening it would be better idea.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
Chaya, Saturday... (question in Hindi)

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,134
Sunday - you see. Let us have it
on Saturday evening.

6
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,815
[Question in Hindi]
Yogini: Thirty-first.

7
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:40,959
Shri Mataji: It will be alright.
Yogi: Yes, thirty-first.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,759
Shri Mataji: Thirty-first? Is it?
Yogi: Halloween.

9
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:46,433
Shri Mataji: Eh? End of week. Yogi:
Halloween. Shri Mataji: Ah. Yogi: Yes.

10
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:54,001
Shri Mataji: Hallo…? Yogi: Halloween,
Mother, it’s a festival… of doubtful origin.

11
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:56,120
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: It’s a fest, a fest.

12
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,196
Halloween is the abbreviation
of the term Hallow’s eve,

13
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:02,919
because November 1st is supposed
to be All Saints’ Day.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,524
November 1st, so the last day
of October is Hallows’eve,

15
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,683
it’s called Halloween. It’s supposed
to be the night when all the demons

16
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:14,800
and witches fly through the sky on those
broomsticks, things like that Mother…

17
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,495
When all the spirits take to the sky
on the night of Halloween.

18
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,647
That's Saturday night.

19
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,798
Shri Mataji: Then we should do it
on a Sunday day!

20
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:31,492
Yogi: The children dress up, Mother,
and dress up as spirits,

21
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:35,040
and ghosts, and they carry lanterns, 
witches.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,319
Shri Mataji: Very bad. 
Yogi: Witches too.

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,760
It’s reputed to be a night when the spirits,
when the dead come out and...

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,245
Shri Mataji: That’s the fourteenth of…
So we’ll have it on a Sunday then,

25
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:47,352
it’s on a Sunday, Sunday. I would not
like to do that day.

26
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:50,298
Yogi: Sunday is, Sunday is reputed
to be All Saints’ Day, Mother,

27
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:53,266
the day of all the Saints, November 1st.
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

28
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:55,344
Yogi: It's called All Saints' Day.
Shri Mataji: That’s a good day.

29
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,835
Then we’ll have All Saints’ Day
plus Diwali day.

30
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:02,318
Saints’ day, it’s good! So we’ll have it
on Sunday, all right?

31
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:08,759
Then the fourteenth day is
very important,

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,827
because that is the day the Goddess

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,540
as a power, as a power,

34
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:26,259
because it was Kartikeya who killed
Narakasura, the devil.

35
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,827
And he was one of the worst of all,
could not be killed.

36
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:40,347
So Shiva and Parvati were married
for this special purpose to produce

37
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:49,551
this powerful Shaktiputra, means the son
of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

38
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:57,661
And He was just born to kill this horrible
devil, called as Narakasura.

39
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:02,504
And He killed. That is the day,
fourteenth day.

40
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:05,426
It is something like Halloween,
that day.

41
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:15,458
Because that is the day they open the gates
of hell and put all the devils into hell.

42
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:21,184
And that’s why that day one has to rest
in the morning time as long as possible.

43
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,944
So that let all the devils be put in
nicely

44
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,912
because some of them might be
hanging around still.

45
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:33,396
It’s better to allow them to get out.

46
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:38,920
I mean, in the realm that you are
you do not feel much their existence.

47
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:44,561
But if you were in the realm of subconscious
area or collective subconscious,

48
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:49,084
people see even some of the spirits
and also can feel their existence,

49
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:52,733
they see the black spots and all that.

50
00:03:53,238 --> 00:04:01,795
So that day is very dangerous, but
because Narakasura was killed,

51
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:10,209
people celebrated. That celebration
is expressed next day,

52
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:14,732
which that day is the day of Diwali
they say.

53
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:20,389
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga
much more than any other country.

54
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:24,420
My concern for America is for
the same reason.

55
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:30,092
I’m not saying so much about South America
but more about the North America.

56
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:38,070
But even in South America, what
I found is that it is a kind of

57
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:47,312
a nation where they have
no guidance at all

58
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:50,719
about dharma, no guidance.

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,944
Openly they are doing carnival,
this, that.

60
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:59,490
I mean, how can you do it in a country,
all those things?

61
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:03,639
They are following the footsteps
of North America.

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,311
Like in North America they have
that Halloween nonsense.

63
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:10,928
I mean, imagine openly on the street
doing Halloween nonsense.

64
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,990
So they are following carnival. To them,
“Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

65
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:20,159
as if there is a very big achievement
and going into that carnival

66
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,115
from all over the places. From Australia
people are coming down.

67
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:33,061
But the worst and the worst
and the worst is the Hollywood.

68
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:43,798
Is the film industry. Under the name
of industry you can do anything.

69
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:51,969
Now this Hollywood is creating
such horrible films,

70
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,258
but the worst is that they get awards
for these worst films.

71
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,658
There’s one film they showed,
I’ve not seen,

72
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,601
I can’t see it.
(The Silence of the Lambs, 1991)

73
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:07,665
They told Me that a man is a cannibal
and he is eating the flesh of human beings

74
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:12,164
and they have shown and they enjoy.

75
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:17,056
Very, very famous. Apart from that,
not only famous,

76
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:22,812
but they got awards for the best film,
the best actor, the best devil.

77
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:29,124
You must get a director from there and
make him eat the flesh of human beings.

78
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,880
It’s the only way, I think,
this horrible thing...

79
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,053
Then they are producing other
pictures.

80
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:36,777
I’ve seen another one for a short time

81
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:40,585
where they shows all dead bodies
hanging, you see.

82
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:43,202
Horrible!

83
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,709
Why these people like to see such
horrible things?

84
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,062
What is their character? Where have
they gone?

85
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:58,533
Why do they enjoy things which
no human being

86
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:03,241
who is a human being will enjoy?

87
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,504
And then it goes further.
Their Halloween business –

88
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:13,730
I saw a film, I said, “My God.”
This is a hell in which

89
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:18,494
they thought it was like the Ras
of Shri Krishna.

90
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:23,853
So it was Krishna consciousness,
I think, that was working there.

91
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:28,049
There are thousand and one things
which can shock you in America,

92
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,993
and also in England, also in Europe.
