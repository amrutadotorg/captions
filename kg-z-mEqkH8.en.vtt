00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:27.600
Today is the day of worshipping your guru:

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.080
that is your Mother.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.260
And as I told you, it’s a very unique happening

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.700
that Mother, Herself, has to become your Guru.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.000
And also you know that it is a very difficult task for a Mother to be a guru,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.560
Because her love is so overflowing

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.720
that it is difficult for Her to give any discipline to Her children.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.520
She can not discipline Her own Love.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.340
How can She discipline Her children?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.200
Being that, the responsibility on the disciples is much more.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.000
If the Guru is the person who can discipline you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.720
without feeling anything

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.180
hurting to him,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.540
he is much more capable, and he can do it.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.720
But for a Mother it is a very, very, very difficult,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.380
I would say, a very difficult job to be the guru.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.860
She does not know how to balance,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.740
And She is extremely forgiving because She is the Mother.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.560
While the guru, from the very beginning, does not forgive.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.500
But mother, till the end, she’ll go to the last end.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.740
Even if the child has forsaken her,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.740
even if he has beaten her up,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.260
even if he is willing to kill Her,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.360
still She will be saying that, "My child are you hurt?"

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.780
Then the responsibility of the disciples is much more, to see

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.420
that they do not hurt Her,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.200
and they do not hurt Her, and they do not take My love for granted.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.460
For they must know that they have to prove themselves

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.360
and they have to improve themselves.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.240
That is why this day it is a very unique combination

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.620
of tremendous Love

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.280
overflowing you,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.120
and also the thought,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.160
I would say, the divine inspiration,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.840
that tells me that you have to be disciplined.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.780
You have to be disciplined sahaja,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.400
not by another person.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.620
But has to be,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.960
because if the ship is not properly tied up

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.980
and it is not seaworthy

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.420
it cannot go very far.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.680
If you want to enjoy

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:59.560
the ride in the ocean of His grace and compassion,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.800
His bliss and kindness,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.980
then you must build up yourself fully.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.000
Now we have seen we have chakras,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:20.740
and we can excite them, we can awaken them by awakening the Deities.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.420
But is it not a mechanical process.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.920
Every Deity has got a subtle point behind it,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.980
which is a very subtle being within you.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.800
You know them, one by one.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.260
And you know why these chakras are catching — because you lack that part.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.760
There is nothing to feel bad about it.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.160
As I told you this is like your motor car outside.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.320
This is your instrument. But the instrument has to be properly harmonised and cleaned.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.780
Today I want certain promises by you to be reached.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.540
And the foremost of all,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.520
as Christ has said,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.220
"Love thy neighbour as thyself".

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.380
I would say, one step ahead of that:

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.300
"Love thy neighbour, a sahaja yogi, more that yourself."

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.480
Let us start here. I don’t ask you to do for the whole universe: among yourselves.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.460
First of all decide: what have you done for others?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:47.160
Second: A promise you have to make that you will never say a harsh word to any other sahaj yogi,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.080
even if he beats you hollow!

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.400
You can tell for that:

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.540
that is the greatest sin you will be committing from sins.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.180
Don't try to correct others!

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.160
If he asks you to check things then tell that sweetly.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.700
But do not be harsh! Use your tongue for saying something sweet.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.060
I am telling you again and again and again.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.380
Otherwise I will put some sort of a restriction on you.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.100
Try to control your tongue.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.400
It’s very essential to put sweetly something, you can,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.400
you are sahaja yogis,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.820
it’s very easy to put it sweetly [something].

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.340
It’s such an attractive thing.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.880
Why do you say harsh things?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.280
For what? To create enemy?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.780
If you want to have enemies, you can have so many:

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.920
for that you need not say harsh things.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.600
Very easy to gather enemies. It is difficult to get friends.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.800
And difficult to get your own kith and kin.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.120
The Sahaj Yogis, you have one Mother.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.980
And that hurts Me the most.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.300
Any, any, thing that tries to break you

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.780
will take out my heart into many parts.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.860
And this body, it becomes divided into many parts.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.860
So don't do that to Me.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.060
This is the greatest suffering I can have from you.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.420
I request you not to do that because I have taken you into My Being,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.420
and you are part and parcel of Me.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.960
You are one of the thousand petals of My Sahasrar,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.500
and I don’t want these petals to be broken by you

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.580
and to be trampled by others.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.900
You have your own dignity, and respect the dignity of others.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.980
And you are Sahaj yogis, realised-souls,

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.780
you must know.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.940
You are not ordinary people.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.360
As you respect yourself, you’ll respect others.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.520
This is one thing I have to tell you:

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.640
that among yourselves you should be very humble

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.980
and very friendly and extremely sweet.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.500
Also when you will start doing that gradually you will learn a method

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.640
by which you’ll be very sweet.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.480
It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.900
It is better to be beaten up than to be beating others.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:33.200
It is better to be simple and deceived than to be deceiving others.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.640
We are like the shield and the shield has to fight the sword.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:50.020
Sword doesn’t fight a sword, the shield does.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.240
This is, you must understand, that for anything

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.640
no harsh words needs to be said. Keep quiet.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:06.500
Just try to control your tongue.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.700
That is one thing:

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.020
that there should not be disunity because you are collectively conscious among yourselves.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040
If there is disunity among you,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.880
you cannot be one: then how can we think of the whole world being one? Just think of it!

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:33.060
And your responsibility is much greater because you are the first people who have got it in the whole of Europe and the whole of England.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.540
Respect each other.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.940
Think of the good points everyone has.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.280
Try to love.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.600
If I were like you:

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.640
you know I am complete I have no problem -

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.440
why am I bothering?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.940
Because I love you.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.240
If you love each other you will see the good points of another,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.060
and you will imbibe them.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.360
Try to love each other

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.860
But do not confuse this love with a carnal love.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.700
his is Divine love:

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:26.160
absolutely pure, elevating, helping you to ascend.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.320
Tonight you promise Me that

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.680
you will look at every sahaja yogi

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.320
as a person in bondage in love

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.860
and not in hatred.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.600
And if somebody you think is not doing right or going bad,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.420
then you cure that person sitting in the house.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.400
You know how to cure.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:58.020
But do not be harsh. By talking ill you are not going to do anything to him.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.920
You use your methods which you know very well.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.000
This is one point. And that will give Me the greatest pleasure, the greatest of all:

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.760
when I will see all my children loving each other,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760
being kind to each other,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.640
running to do for others, trying to help each other

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.140
and extremely humbled down.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.980
Some of you are better off, some of you are more intelligent,

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.180
some of you have got more heart qualities.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.740
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:33.760
or somebody who has little less of love
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.300
or somebody who has little less of love.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.740
May be that person just he wants more love.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.400
But try to give than to expect others to give.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.420
Then the second one: I want you, all of you,

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.560
today, to know that you are the people

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.100
who have to build up sahaja yoga in your country

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.500
and also in other countries wherever you go.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.500
So you have to give it like seeds

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.080
and the seeds which has to grow the Whole Tree!

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.100
You have to bear all other trees - so how important you are!

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.100
So today you have to resolve

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.960
that in your personal life you are going to be honest.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.940
You are going to watch yourself, you are going to introspect yourself,

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.940
you are not going to tell lies.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.920
And you are going to look after your chastity, look after your life

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.660
as a very precious thing!

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.120
And you are not going to cheat yourself.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.400
And you are not going to debase yourself.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.740
And you are not going to denigrate yourself,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.140
in your own eyes!

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:43.400
But develop those eyes which criticise all these things and can see Yourself.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.160
Today you must promise Me that you will meditate, you’ll introspect

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.280
than getting into your ego.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.980
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaj Yog

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.300
— that is God’s own methods —  at any cost!

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.060
If you do not understand a part of Sahaj Yog, you can come and ask Me, but don’t criticise!

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.320
This is you must promise Me.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.980
So far whatever has happened, has happened.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.440
It’s finished. It’s forgiven. But don’t criticise His ways now anymore,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:27.320
because now you are put into a higher position. You are put into a higher position, today.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:34.300
No more criticism of Sahaj Yog, at any cost, I think!

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.740
Because then you criticise God.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.100
If you don't understand - ask Me.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.660
And now you know

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.520
you are the people, God has sent only those who really know

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.220
that Sahaja Yoga is the ONLY way.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.380
It is revealed to you only, very few people, that this is the Truth.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.980
And this is going to save the whole humanity and all the people.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.040
And God can be ONLY understood through Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.140
Nobody is going to decry Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.960
Nor anyone is going to say that, "I am the Sahaja Yoga".

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:23.960
Anybody who can say that has been always, so far, we have seen in our practices in Sahaja yoga for the last now so many years,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.500
that anyone who takes up upon to themselves that "I am the Sahaja Yoga"

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.640
has had the worst possible falls of all Sahaj Yogis.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.160
Don't do it.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:40.620
We are a part and parcel of that Sahaj Yoga: harmonising people, being one with people.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.620
So nobody should criticise Sahaja Yog.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.240
Nobody should take chances with Sahaja Yog.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.200
And forth: you have to be obedient to Me.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.480
I have been telling you, in a different way

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.240
and every way that you should understand.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.240
Now good point.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.240
Today you have done this puja,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.760
I want to tell you that on you Own,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.960
on your free will, with your own understanding

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.160
you have to be obedient to Me.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.780
This is your own decision.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.100
I can not force obedience on you,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.180
but you must understand it is for your own good.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.920
Because every minute I can see your future, I can see your past, I can see your ascent, I can see everything.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.400
If I say anything at that moment, it may appear a little bit unreasonable, but just obey Me, what I tell you!

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.300
I am not asking too much, you have seen: not much, as other gurus do.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.300
You don’t know other gurus what do they do:

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.820
They will hang the disciple in the well half way down.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:52.340
He is just there, from his waste, you see, they will be hanging a rope up.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.500
They take seven parikshas (परीक्षा — trial, test) like this horrible ones.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.220
They will throw him into some place.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.920
7 like this, they are all together 108 parikshas.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.700
And then they'll say, "come along". Then they will try [to teach you], it starts after all.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.700
I am not taking your test.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.240
But obedience is very necessary,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.220
because I know everything.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.000
I can't help it, you can not have another opinion about My [ ] because that is it.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.640
And if I say something, I would not say normally,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.280
I will not hurt you, you know that.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.800
I hate to hurt you, after any hurt I cause you I weep and cry.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.360
But I have to do it, because you are my dearest children.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:46.300
And you are My [will] and you have to do the most important thing on Earth so be careful.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:52.940
Whatever I have told you, you have to obey. For today for this place

00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:00.980
and today's function [ ] these are the three clear restrictions.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.180
I have not asked for much.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.860
But it was very difficult.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.940
They are difficult.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.720
Look after yourself, try to be good sahaja yogis,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.960
be sweet to each other, kind to each other

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.440
Don't deceive yourself,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.460
look after your vibrations at everything will work out.
