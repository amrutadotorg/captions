00:16.360 --> 00:27.600
Today is the day of worshipping your guru:

00:28.640 --> 00:31.080
that is your Mother.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.260
And as I told you, it’s a very unique happening

00:36.260 --> 00:39.700
that Mother, Herself, has to become your Guru.

00:39.700 --> 00:46.000
And also you know that it is a very difficult task for a Mother to be a guru,

00:46.000 --> 00:54.560
Because her love is so overflowing

00:54.560 --> 01:01.720
that it is difficult for Her to give any discipline to Her children.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.520
She can not discipline Her own Love.

01:04.520 --> 01:08.340
How can She discipline Her children?

01:08.640 --> 01:16.200
Being that, the responsibility on the disciples is much more.

01:16.200 --> 01:25.000
If the Guru is the person who can discipline you

01:25.000 --> 01:29.720
without feeling anything

01:33.100 --> 01:37.180
hurting to him,

01:37.180 --> 01:42.540
he is much more capable, and he can do it.

01:42.540 --> 01:51.720
But for a Mother it is a very, very, very difficult,

01:57.160 --> 02:04.380
I would say, a very difficult job to be the guru.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.860
She does not know how to balance,

02:07.980 --> 02:13.740
And She is extremely forgiving because She is the Mother.

02:13.780 --> 02:18.560
While the guru, from the very beginning, does not forgive.

02:18.560 --> 02:23.500
But mother, till the end, she’ll go to the last end.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.740
Even if the child has forsaken her,

02:26.740 --> 02:28.740
even if he has beaten her up,

02:28.740 --> 02:31.260
even if he is willing to kill Her,

02:31.340 --> 02:38.360
still She will be saying that, "My child are you hurt?"

02:41.680 --> 02:45.780
Then the responsibility of the disciples is much more, to see

02:45.780 --> 02:49.420
that they do not hurt Her,

02:49.420 --> 02:52.200
and they do not hurt Her, and they do not take My love for granted.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.460
For they must know that they have to prove themselves

02:56.780 --> 03:01.360
and they have to improve themselves.

03:01.700 --> 03:06.240
That is why this day it is a very unique combination

03:06.240 --> 03:08.620
of tremendous Love

03:08.800 --> 03:11.280
overflowing you,

03:11.300 --> 03:16.120
and also the thought,

03:16.120 --> 03:19.160
I would say, the divine inspiration,

03:19.160 --> 03:23.840
that tells me that you have to be disciplined.

03:24.420 --> 03:27.780
You have to be disciplined sahaja,

03:27.780 --> 03:30.400
not by another person.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.620
But has to be,

03:32.640 --> 03:37.960
because if the ship is not properly tied up

03:37.980 --> 03:39.980
and it is not seaworthy

03:39.980 --> 03:44.420
it cannot go very far.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.680
If you want to enjoy

03:50.680 --> 03:59.560
the ride in the ocean of His grace and compassion,

03:59.560 --> 04:02.800
His bliss and kindness,

04:02.800 --> 04:08.980
then you must build up yourself fully.

04:09.980 --> 04:13.000
Now we have seen we have chakras,

04:13.020 --> 04:20.740
and we can excite them, we can awaken them by awakening the Deities.

04:20.940 --> 04:23.420
But is it not a mechanical process.

04:23.420 --> 04:26.920
Every Deity has got a subtle point behind it,

04:26.920 --> 04:32.980
which is a very subtle being within you.

04:36.060 --> 04:38.800
You know them, one by one.

04:38.800 --> 04:45.260
And you know why these chakras are catching — because you lack that part.

04:45.340 --> 04:47.760
There is nothing to feel bad about it.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.160
As I told you this is like your motor car outside.

04:51.160 --> 04:57.320
This is your instrument. But the instrument has to be properly harmonised and cleaned.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.780
Today I want certain promises by you to be reached.

05:01.860 --> 05:06.540
And the foremost of all,

05:09.060 --> 05:10.520
as Christ has said,

05:10.520 --> 05:13.220
"Love thy neighbour as thyself".

05:13.220 --> 05:16.380
I would say, one step ahead of that:

05:16.380 --> 05:22.300
"Love thy neighbour, a sahaja yogi, more that yourself."

05:27.300 --> 05:34.480
Let us start here. I don’t ask you to do for the whole universe: among yourselves.

05:34.520 --> 05:39.460
First of all decide: what have you done for others?

05:39.460 --> 05:47.160
Second: A promise you have to make that you will never say a harsh word to any other sahaj yogi,

05:47.160 --> 05:51.080
even if he beats you hollow!

05:51.300 --> 05:54.400
You can tell for that:

05:54.400 --> 05:58.540
that is the greatest sin you will be committing from sins.

05:58.540 --> 06:02.180
Don't try to correct others!

06:02.180 --> 06:07.160
If he asks you to check things then tell that sweetly.

06:07.420 --> 06:11.700
But do not be harsh! Use your tongue for saying something sweet.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.060
I am telling you again and again and again.

06:14.060 --> 06:18.380
Otherwise I will put some sort of a restriction on you.

06:18.380 --> 06:22.100
Try to control your tongue.

06:23.020 --> 06:26.400
It’s very essential to put sweetly something, you can,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
you are sahaja yogis,

06:28.400 --> 06:30.820
it’s very easy to put it sweetly [something].

06:30.820 --> 06:33.340
It’s such an attractive thing.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.880
Why do you say harsh things?

06:35.880 --> 06:40.280
For what? To create enemy?

06:41.260 --> 06:43.780
If you want to have enemies, you can have so many:

06:43.780 --> 06:46.920
for that you need not say harsh things.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.600
Very easy to gather enemies. It is difficult to get friends.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.800
And difficult to get your own kith and kin.

06:53.800 --> 06:58.120
The Sahaj Yogis, you have one Mother.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.980
And that hurts Me the most.

07:00.980 --> 07:06.300
Any, any, thing that tries to break you

07:06.300 --> 07:09.780
will take out my heart into many parts.

07:09.780 --> 07:15.860
And this body, it becomes divided into many parts.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.860
So don't do that to Me.

07:17.860 --> 07:21.060
This is the greatest suffering I can have from you.

07:21.060 --> 07:26.420
I request you not to do that because I have taken you into My Being,

07:26.420 --> 07:28.420
and you are part and parcel of Me.

07:28.420 --> 07:33.960
You are one of the thousand petals of My Sahasrar,

07:33.980 --> 07:38.500
and I don’t want these petals to be broken by you

07:38.500 --> 07:42.580
and to be trampled by others.

07:42.900 --> 07:46.900
You have your own dignity, and respect the dignity of others.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.980
And you are Sahaj yogis, realised-souls,

07:49.980 --> 07:51.780
you must know.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.940
You are not ordinary people.

07:55.300 --> 07:59.360
As you respect yourself, you’ll respect others.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.520
This is one thing I have to tell you:

08:02.520 --> 08:05.640
that among yourselves you should be very humble

08:05.640 --> 08:09.980
and very friendly and extremely sweet.

08:09.980 --> 08:13.500
Also when you will start doing that gradually you will learn a method

08:13.500 --> 08:16.640
by which you’ll be very sweet.

08:16.640 --> 08:21.480
It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.

08:21.480 --> 08:25.900
It is better to be beaten up than to be beating others.

08:25.900 --> 08:33.200
It is better to be simple and deceived than to be deceiving others.

08:37.500 --> 08:43.640
We are like the shield and the shield has to fight the sword.

08:43.640 --> 08:50.020
Sword doesn’t fight a sword, the shield does.

08:51.040 --> 08:55.240
This is, you must understand, that for anything

08:55.240 --> 09:00.640
no harsh words needs to be said. Keep quiet.

09:01.380 --> 09:06.500
Just try to control your tongue.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.700
That is one thing:

09:08.700 --> 09:13.020
that there should not be disunity because you are collectively conscious among yourselves.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
If there is disunity among you,

09:15.040 --> 09:19.880
you cannot be one: then how can we think of the whole world being one? Just think of it!

09:19.880 --> 09:33.060
And your responsibility is much greater because you are the first people who have got it in the whole of Europe and the whole of England.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.540
Respect each other.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.940
Think of the good points everyone has.

09:41.940 --> 09:44.280
Try to love.

09:44.420 --> 09:47.600
If I were like you:

09:47.600 --> 09:51.640
you know I am complete I have no problem -

09:51.640 --> 09:54.440
why am I bothering?

09:54.440 --> 09:57.940
Because I love you.

10:00.200 --> 10:06.240
If you love each other you will see the good points of another,

10:06.260 --> 10:10.060
and you will imbibe them.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.360
Try to love each other

10:12.360 --> 10:16.860
But do not confuse this love with a carnal love.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.700
his is Divine love:

10:18.700 --> 10:26.160
absolutely pure, elevating, helping you to ascend.

10:26.900 --> 10:31.320
Tonight you promise Me that

10:31.320 --> 10:35.680
you will look at every sahaja yogi

10:35.680 --> 10:38.320
as a person in bondage in love

10:38.320 --> 10:40.860
and not in hatred.

10:41.640 --> 10:46.600
And if somebody you think is not doing right or going bad,

10:46.600 --> 10:49.420
then you cure that person sitting in the house.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.400
You know how to cure.

10:51.400 --> 10:58.020
But do not be harsh. By talking ill you are not going to do anything to him.

10:58.060 --> 11:01.920
You use your methods which you know very well.

11:01.920 --> 11:07.000
This is one point. And that will give Me the greatest pleasure, the greatest of all:

11:07.000 --> 11:10.760
when I will see all my children loving each other,

11:10.760 --> 11:12.760
being kind to each other,

11:12.760 --> 11:16.640
running to do for others, trying to help each other

11:16.640 --> 11:20.140
and extremely humbled down.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.980
Some of you are better off, some of you are more intelligent,

11:24.980 --> 11:29.180
some of you have got more heart qualities.

11:29.180 --> 11:33.740
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence,

11:33.740 --> 11:33.760
or somebody who has little less of love
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence

11:33.760 --> 11:36.300
or somebody who has little less of love.

11:36.300 --> 11:40.740
May be that person just he wants more love.

11:40.840 --> 11:45.400
But try to give than to expect others to give.

11:46.360 --> 11:51.420
Then the second one: I want you, all of you,

11:51.420 --> 11:54.560
today, to know that you are the people

11:54.560 --> 11:57.100
who have to build up sahaja yoga in your country

11:57.100 --> 12:01.500
and also in other countries wherever you go.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
So you have to give it like seeds

12:03.500 --> 12:07.080
and the seeds which has to grow the Whole Tree!

12:07.080 --> 12:11.100
You have to bear all other trees - so how important you are!

12:11.100 --> 12:13.100
So today you have to resolve

12:13.100 --> 12:16.960
that in your personal life you are going to be honest.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.940
You are going to watch yourself, you are going to introspect yourself,

12:20.940 --> 12:22.940
you are not going to tell lies.

12:22.940 --> 12:26.920
And you are going to look after your chastity, look after your life

12:26.920 --> 12:29.660
as a very precious thing!

12:29.680 --> 12:32.120
And you are not going to cheat yourself.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.400
And you are not going to debase yourself.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.740
And you are not going to denigrate yourself,

12:36.740 --> 12:38.140
in your own eyes!

12:38.140 --> 12:43.400
But develop those eyes which criticise all these things and can see Yourself.

12:43.400 --> 12:50.160
Today you must promise Me that you will meditate, you’ll introspect

12:50.160 --> 12:54.280
than getting into your ego.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.980
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaj Yog

13:02.040 --> 13:05.300
— that is God’s own methods —  at any cost!

13:05.300 --> 13:10.060
If you do not understand a part of Sahaj Yog, you can come and ask Me, but don’t criticise!

13:10.060 --> 13:12.320
This is you must promise Me.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.980
So far whatever has happened, has happened.

13:14.980 --> 13:19.440
It’s finished. It’s forgiven. But don’t criticise His ways now anymore,

13:19.440 --> 13:27.320
because now you are put into a higher position. You are put into a higher position, today.

13:27.320 --> 13:34.300
No more criticism of Sahaj Yog, at any cost, I think!

13:34.700 --> 13:37.740
Because then you criticise God.

13:37.740 --> 13:42.100
If you don't understand - ask Me.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.660
And now you know

13:45.660 --> 13:49.520
you are the people, God has sent only those who really know

13:49.520 --> 13:53.220
that Sahaja Yoga is the ONLY way.

13:53.220 --> 13:57.380
It is revealed to you only, very few people, that this is the Truth.

13:57.380 --> 14:00.980
And this is going to save the whole humanity and all the people.

14:00.980 --> 14:05.040
And God can be ONLY understood through Sahaja Yoga.

14:05.040 --> 14:09.140
Nobody is going to decry Sahaja Yoga.

14:09.140 --> 14:13.960
Nor anyone is going to say that, "I am the Sahaja Yoga".

14:15.060 --> 14:23.960
Anybody who can say that has been always, so far, we have seen in our practices in Sahaja yoga for the last now so many years,

14:23.960 --> 14:27.500
that anyone who takes up upon to themselves that "I am the Sahaja Yoga"

14:27.500 --> 14:31.640
has had the worst possible falls of all Sahaj Yogis.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.160
Don't do it.

14:33.160 --> 14:40.620
We are a part and parcel of that Sahaj Yoga: harmonising people, being one with people.

14:43.140 --> 14:46.620
So nobody should criticise Sahaja Yog.

14:46.620 --> 14:50.240
Nobody should take chances with Sahaja Yog.

14:50.240 --> 14:55.200
And forth: you have to be obedient to Me.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.480
I have been telling you, in a different way

14:59.480 --> 15:03.240
and every way that you should understand.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.240
Now good point.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.240
Today you have done this puja,

15:07.240 --> 15:10.760
I want to tell you that on you Own,

15:10.760 --> 15:13.960
on your free will, with your own understanding

15:13.960 --> 15:16.160
you have to be obedient to Me.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.780
This is your own decision.

15:17.780 --> 15:20.100
I can not force obedience on you,

15:20.100 --> 15:23.180
but you must understand it is for your own good.

15:23.180 --> 15:29.920
Because every minute I can see your future, I can see your past, I can see your ascent, I can see everything.

15:29.920 --> 15:35.400
If I say anything at that moment, it may appear a little bit unreasonable, but just obey Me, what I tell you!

15:35.400 --> 15:39.300
I am not asking too much, you have seen: not much, as other gurus do.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.300
You don’t know other gurus what do they do:

15:41.300 --> 15:45.820
They will hang the disciple in the well half way down.

15:45.820 --> 15:52.340
He is just there, from his waste, you see, they will be hanging a rope up.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.500
They take seven parikshas (परीक्षा — trial, test) like this horrible ones.

15:55.500 --> 15:59.220
They will throw him into some place.

15:59.220 --> 16:02.920
7 like this, they are all together 108 parikshas.

16:02.920 --> 16:07.700
And then they'll say, "come along". Then they will try [to teach you], it starts after all.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.700
I am not taking your test.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.240
But obedience is very necessary,

16:12.320 --> 16:16.220
because I know everything.

16:17.040 --> 16:23.000
I can't help it, you can not have another opinion about My [ ] because that is it.

16:23.820 --> 16:26.640
And if I say something, I would not say normally,

16:26.640 --> 16:28.280
I will not hurt you, you know that.

16:28.280 --> 16:33.800
I hate to hurt you, after any hurt I cause you I weep and cry.

16:33.800 --> 16:39.360
But I have to do it, because you are my dearest children.

16:39.400 --> 16:46.300
And you are My [will] and you have to do the most important thing on Earth so be careful.

16:46.300 --> 16:52.940
Whatever I have told you, you have to obey. For today for this place
