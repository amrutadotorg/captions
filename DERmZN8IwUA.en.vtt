00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:11.896
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:22.289
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:34.111
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.775
and the wind was blowing from all sides

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:46.335
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:54.516
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

00:00:54.717 --> 00:01:01.751
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:09.671
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.044
that He must have felt.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.416
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:25.624
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:30.754
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:35.967
When our attention is on our Spirit,

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:48.709
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:57.011
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:03.094
complaining about comforts,

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:09.166
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:20.133
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:30.337
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:37.969
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.832
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:50.037
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:54.627
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:54.828 --> 00:02:57.018
and that goes to My credit, I think,

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:05.078
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:11.177
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:20.250
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:24.941
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:33.954
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:38.860
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:44.858
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:51.462
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:57.434
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:01.227
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:05.889
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.629
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.328
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.933
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

00:04:21.134 --> 00:04:27.768
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:32.045
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:38.412
as we say, is the light,

00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:46.325
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:54.117
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

00:04:54.318 --> 00:05:02.393
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:11.036
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

00:05:11.237 --> 00:05:17.765
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:24.282
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

00:05:24.836 --> 00:05:31.341
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:36.217
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:41.472
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:48.617
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

00:05:48.818 --> 00:05:53.287
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

00:05:53.488 --> 00:05:57.417
can be born in a manger,

00:05:57.638 --> 00:06:02.041
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:10.453
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:17.682
we should make ourselves miserable

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:24.690
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:29.477
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

00:06:29.678 --> 00:06:34.278
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:42.904
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:45.117
That's the main point.

00:06:45.318 --> 00:06:51.047
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

00:06:51.248 --> 00:06:54.050
then He gives you hundred times more.

00:06:54.251 --> 00:06:58.214
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

00:06:58.415 --> 00:07:01.867
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

00:07:02.068 --> 00:07:05.896
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

00:07:06.097 --> 00:07:10.237
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

00:07:10.438 --> 00:07:16.021
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:23.751
no material well-being, as we call it.

00:07:23.952 --> 00:07:33.145
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:40.232
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:45.917
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

00:07:46.118 --> 00:07:50.438
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:55.234
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

00:07:56.506 --> 00:08:04.362
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

00:08:04.563 --> 00:08:12.143
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

00:08:12.706 --> 00:08:16.607
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:24.180
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:27.611
and in that evaluation

00:08:28.198 --> 00:08:35.699
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:42.469
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:49.667
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

00:08:49.868 --> 00:08:55.014
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

00:08:55.215 --> 00:08:58.082
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

00:08:58.283 --> 00:09:03.523
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

00:09:03.837 --> 00:09:08.050
because they are not your relations.

00:09:08.878 --> 00:09:11.700
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:18.655
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:25.168
just give them up on this point.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:30.337
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:33.869
that we must forgive.

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:39.233
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:43.326
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:47.887
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:53.523
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

00:09:53.724 --> 00:10:00.065
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:09.233
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

00:10:10.697 --> 00:10:19.279
His life has been a story of spirituality,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.909
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.153
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

00:10:30.322 --> 00:10:36.487
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

00:10:36.688 --> 00:10:42.896
as itâ€™s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

00:10:43.097 --> 00:10:47.068
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:49.928
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:53.433
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

00:10:53.634 --> 00:10:59.866
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:04.230
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:08.535
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:17.521
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

00:11:18.198 --> 00:11:20.976
He has proved it beyond doubt.

00:11:21.177 --> 00:11:26.289
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:31.996
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

00:11:32.816 --> 00:11:42.831
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.429
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.576
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

00:11:49.777 --> 00:11:52.528
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

00:11:52.729 --> 00:11:55.639
There have been so many events in this
short time.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.715
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:03.293
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
