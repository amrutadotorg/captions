00:01.480 --> 00:11.896
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:14.947 --> 00:22.289
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

00:23.262 --> 00:34.111
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

00:34.720 --> 00:37.775
and the wind was blowing from all sides

00:37.976 --> 00:46.335
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

00:46.536 --> 00:54.516
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

00:54.717 --> 01:01.751
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

01:01.952 --> 01:09.671
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

01:10.410 --> 01:14.044
that He must have felt.

01:15.680 --> 01:19.416
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

01:19.617 --> 01:25.624
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

01:25.904 --> 01:30.754
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

01:31.935 --> 01:35.967
When our attention is on our Spirit,

01:36.168 --> 01:48.709
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

01:48.910 --> 01:57.011
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

01:58.681 --> 02:03.094
complaining about comforts,

02:03.295 --> 02:09.166
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

02:09.367 --> 02:20.133
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

02:23.086 --> 02:30.337
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

02:30.538 --> 02:37.969
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

02:38.170 --> 02:44.832
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

02:45.033 --> 02:50.037
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

02:50.238 --> 02:54.627
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

02:54.828 --> 02:57.018
and that goes to My credit, I think,

02:57.219 --> 03:05.078
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

03:07.204 --> 03:11.177
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

03:11.378 --> 03:20.250
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

03:20.451 --> 03:24.941
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

03:25.142 --> 03:33.954
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

03:34.208 --> 03:38.860
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

03:39.061 --> 03:44.858
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

03:45.059 --> 03:51.462
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

03:51.663 --> 03:57.434
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

03:57.635 --> 04:01.227
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

04:01.428 --> 04:05.889
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

04:06.090 --> 04:11.629
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

04:11.830 --> 04:17.328
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

04:17.529 --> 04:20.933
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

04:21.134 --> 04:27.768
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

04:27.969 --> 04:32.045
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

04:32.246 --> 04:38.412
as we say, is the light,

04:39.384 --> 04:46.325
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

04:46.526 --> 04:54.117
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

04:54.318 --> 05:02.393
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

05:02.594 --> 05:11.036
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

05:11.237 --> 05:17.765
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

05:17.966 --> 05:24.282
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

05:24.836 --> 05:31.341
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

05:31.542 --> 05:36.217
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

05:36.418 --> 05:41.472
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

05:41.673 --> 05:48.617
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

05:48.818 --> 05:53.287
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

05:53.488 --> 05:57.417
can be born in a manger,

05:57.638 --> 06:02.041
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

06:02.242 --> 06:10.453
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

06:10.654 --> 06:17.682
we should make ourselves miserable

06:17.883 --> 06:24.690
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

06:24.891 --> 06:29.477
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

06:29.678 --> 06:34.278
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

06:34.479 --> 06:42.904
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

06:43.105 --> 06:45.117
That's the main point.

06:45.318 --> 06:51.047
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

06:51.248 --> 06:54.050
then He gives you hundred times more.

06:54.251 --> 06:58.214
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

06:58.415 --> 07:01.867
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

07:02.068 --> 07:05.896
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

07:06.097 --> 07:10.237
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

07:10.438 --> 07:16.021
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

07:16.222 --> 07:23.751
no material well-being, as we call it.

07:23.952 --> 07:33.145
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

07:35.359 --> 07:40.232
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

07:40.433 --> 07:45.917
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

07:46.118 --> 07:50.438
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

07:50.605 --> 07:55.234
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

07:56.506 --> 08:04.362
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

08:04.563 --> 08:12.143
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

08:12.706 --> 08:16.607
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

08:16.808 --> 08:24.180
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

08:24.381 --> 08:27.611
and in that evaluation

08:28.198 --> 08:35.699
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

08:37.167 --> 08:42.469
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

08:42.670 --> 08:49.667
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

08:49.868 --> 08:55.014
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

08:55.215 --> 08:58.082
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

08:58.283 --> 09:03.523
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

09:03.837 --> 09:08.050
because they are not your relations.

09:08.878 --> 09:11.700
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

09:11.901 --> 09:18.655
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

09:21.199 --> 09:25.168
just give them up on this point.

09:25.774 --> 09:30.337
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

09:30.529 --> 09:33.869
that we must forgive.

09:34.386 --> 09:39.233
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

09:39.593 --> 09:43.326
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

09:43.527 --> 09:47.887
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

09:48.088 --> 09:53.523
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

09:53.724 --> 10:00.065
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

10:00.239 --> 10:09.233
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

10:10.697 --> 10:19.279
His life has been a story of spirituality,

10:19.480 --> 10:24.909
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

10:25.110 --> 10:30.153
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

10:30.322 --> 10:36.487
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

10:36.688 --> 10:42.896
as itâ€™s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

10:43.097 --> 10:47.068
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

10:47.269 --> 10:49.928
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

10:50.129 --> 10:53.433
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

10:53.634 --> 10:59.866
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

11:00.067 --> 11:04.230
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

11:04.431 --> 11:08.535
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

11:08.736 --> 11:17.521
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

11:18.198 --> 11:20.976
He has proved it beyond doubt.

11:21.177 --> 11:26.289
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

11:26.490 --> 11:31.996
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

11:32.816 --> 11:42.831
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.429
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

11:47.630 --> 11:49.576
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

11:49.777 --> 11:52.528
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

11:52.729 --> 11:55.639
There have been so many events in this
short time.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.715
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

11:59.916 --> 12:03.293
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
