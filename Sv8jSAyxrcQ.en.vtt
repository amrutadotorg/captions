07:44.657 --> 07:49.810
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

07:54.482 --> 08:01.496
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

08:03.649 --> 08:08.180
We cannot change it; we cannot transform it.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.608
Also, unfortunately,

08:12.808 --> 08:18.379
with this human awareness we cannot know it.

08:19.025 --> 08:23.830
Can they hear, all of them? Ask them can they hear, all of them.

08:32.026 --> 08:34.248
Yogini: He is saying that with the fan it is not helping,

08:34.448 --> 08:37.477
All right, then put it off.

08:37.678 --> 08:42.881
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

08:43.081 --> 08:49.505
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

08:53.013 --> 08:59.372
Better. It makes too much sound; fan was making too much sound.

09:05.901 --> 09:13.138
So now we have to know that our awareness

09:13.338 --> 09:20.045
is not sufficient enough to know the absolute Truth.

09:20.666 --> 09:25.403
Actually, we don't know the absolute Truth.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.866
That's why there is a problem.

09:32.487 --> 09:35.655
Somebody says this is good. Somebody says that is good.

09:35.855 --> 09:42.299
There is a quarrel, fight, arguments, and ultimately wars.

09:43.513 --> 09:47.630
That means we have to evolve more.

09:49.744 --> 09:52.848
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

09:53.048 --> 09:57.337
you should not accept it blindfolded,

09:58.995 --> 10:08.886
but accept it as a hypothesis.

10:10.494 --> 10:18.230
And if it is proved, then you have to accept it as honest people.

10:19.102 --> 10:22.933
Because it is for your benevolence,

10:23.134 --> 10:26.942
for the benevolence of your family, your country,

10:27.143 --> 10:31.291
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

10:36.359 --> 10:39.674
At the very outset, I would like to tell you

10:39.874 --> 10:47.041
that the truth is you are not this body, this mind,

10:47.248 --> 10:56.342
these emotions, intellect, conditionings, or your ego.

10:58.689 --> 11:03.185
But you are the pure Spirit.

11:04.275 --> 11:09.940
There is another truth is, you see all these beautiful flowers

11:10.140 --> 11:13.765
and we take them for granted.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.771
Actually, it's a miracle.

11:19.355 --> 11:22.952
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

11:23.152 --> 11:27.448
so he will say, It is the autonomous nervous system.

11:28.219 --> 11:32.366
But who is this auto?

11:32.567 --> 11:35.497
Also, if you take to science

11:35.698 --> 11:37.756
you will find they cannot answer

11:37.957 --> 11:42.866
all the questions because it has its own limitations.

11:44.854 --> 11:50.338
For example, science cannot tell you why are you on this earth,

11:50.747 --> 11:54.687
what is your identity.

11:55.139 --> 11:59.335
So we take to religions.

12:00.501 --> 12:03.528
But in the modern times, religions have become

12:03.736 --> 12:07.751
money oriented or power oriented.

12:09.542 --> 12:18.337
Also, it was great incarnations who came

12:18.538 --> 12:23.710
like Christ, Mohammed Saab, Moses.

12:23.911 --> 12:29.623
They were very great, pure incarnations

12:30.509 --> 12:33.747
and they did not know what sort of people they were facing.

12:33.948 --> 12:38.260
The way they were tortured and crucified.

12:39.175 --> 12:44.342
They preached to people who cannot follow their followings,

12:44.543 --> 12:48.875
they cannot follow their principles.

12:50.336 --> 12:54.251
For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter  Mathews

12:54.475 --> 13:00.162
that if your one eye commits a sin, you take out the eye.

13:01.538 --> 13:07.835
If your one hand does some sinful thing, you cut out the hand.

13:08.036 --> 13:12.794
If somebody slaps you on this face, turn the other face.

13:13.927 --> 13:19.185
I haven't seen any Christian without eye and without hands.

13:20.943 --> 13:26.364
It's an impossible thing and very difficult.

13:27.958 --> 13:33.872
It was easy for Christ to say that because He was so great.

13:34.339 --> 13:41.978
Actually, you have to become a saint to follow His principles.

13:42.690 --> 13:47.255
Ordinary people cannot follow Him.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.922
Then I think Mohammed Saab thought that He was so strict

13:51.131 --> 13:59.004
with the men, so He made lots of laws for the women also.

13:59.963 --> 14:05.482
And so strict that any woman who looked at any man

14:05.683 --> 14:08.819
with any lust, she should be buried halfway

14:09.020 --> 14:13.133
and should be stoned.

14:14.140 --> 14:18.804
Imagine what would have happened to American women.

14:24.178 --> 14:26.697
So the principle of morality

14:26.898 --> 14:31.898
was really too much for normal human beings.

14:32.983 --> 14:36.887
Also, the Sharia which was brought in by Mohammed Saab

14:37.088 --> 14:41.768
was given by Moses for the Jews.

14:42.700 --> 14:46.188
In the Bible in the Old Testament, in the Jeremiah,

14:46.389 --> 14:50.818
it is described clearly.

14:51.417 --> 14:56.183
But Jews thought it was too much, so they didnt bother.

14:56.953 --> 14:59.107
But Muslims think they can do it;

14:59.308 --> 15:03.288
I am sure they can't.

15:03.848 --> 15:07.968
So, they believe they are Muslims, but they are not.

15:08.887 --> 15:13.489
Christians believe they are Christians, but they are not.

15:14.426 --> 15:18.614
First you have to become a saint.

15:19.731 --> 15:24.260
You have to become an enlightened personality

15:24.956 --> 15:30.120
so that automatically you become righteous, automatically.

15:30.676 --> 15:35.989
In Sahaja Yoga, we dont have any punishments.

15:36.553 --> 15:40.935
Here, we have to accept human beings as they are.

15:41.271 --> 15:50.980
There are no confessions, and no physical or mental punishments.

15:51.965 --> 15:56.713
At the most, we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

15:58.019 --> 16:06.274
As this Power lies in the sacrum bone, it's your own.

16:07.317 --> 16:13.106
She is your Mother, your individual Mother.

16:14.513 --> 16:18.907
She knows all about you

16:19.108 --> 16:23.897
and She is very anxious to give you your second birth.

16:24.388 --> 16:26.618
It is in the real sense of the word

16:26.819 --> 16:31.241
[that] you have to have your second birth.

16:31.919 --> 16:37.819
It is not just a make-believe that you are twice born.

16:39.217 --> 16:41.741
It becomes like any other brand like you are a Christian

16:41.942 --> 16:47.067
or a Hindu or a Muslim or a twice born.

16:47.671 --> 16:52.577
But anybody can commit any sin.

16:54.344 --> 16:58.454
Anybody can commit any sin.

17:00.560 --> 17:04.961
So one has to become innately righteous,

17:05.162 --> 17:09.521
innately moral.

17:12.801 --> 17:18.285
It's only possible when you become the Spirit.

17:20.157 --> 17:24.668
When this Kundalini rises, She passes through six centers

17:24.869 --> 17:28.718
which are responsible for our physical, mental,

17:28.919 --> 17:33.169
emotional, and spiritual being.

17:34.376 --> 17:36.512
Thus, our physical being improves,

17:36.713 --> 17:42.153
or sometimes absolutely in perfect condition.

17:43.131 --> 17:48.478
In India there are four doctors from Delhi university

17:48.679 --> 17:52.906
who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga.

17:53.679 --> 17:58.464
Many incurable diseases can be cured with Sahaja Yoga.

17:59.693 --> 18:07.763
For diagnosis or for treatment, you don't have to go to hospitals

18:08.315 --> 18:13.528
because you know self-knowledge.

18:13.729 --> 18:17.900
You get self-knowledge

18:18.831 --> 18:24.362
because you start feeling on your fingertips your own centers.

18:24.652 --> 18:31.582
You start feeling this all-pervading Power on your fingertips.

18:32.533 --> 18:36.211
So, this is the second truth that you have to know

18:36.411 --> 18:41.645
that there is an all-pervading Power of divine Love.

18:42.682 --> 18:45.998
In the Koran, Mohammed Saab has clearly said that

18:46.199 --> 18:48.698
when you will get your resurrection,

18:48.899 --> 18:54.589
your hands, your fingers will know about you

18:54.790 --> 18:59.486
and they will tell you about you.

19:00.770 --> 19:05.051
This is the time of your resurrection.

19:05.652 --> 19:13.423
I call it a blossom time, but in the Bible it is described as the last judgement.

19:14.490 --> 19:17.387
You have to choose; you are free to choose.

19:17.588 --> 19:19.969
If you want to go to hell, you can go.

19:20.170 --> 19:24.381
If you want to go to heaven, you can go.

19:28.887 --> 19:37.122
From the day you get your realization,

19:37.323 --> 19:43.028
you start the transformation within yourself.

19:44.664 --> 19:48.892
In the light of the Spirit, you become your own guide,

19:49.093 --> 19:53.001
your own master.

19:53.202 --> 19:57.632
You give up everything that is destructive.

19:58.584 --> 20:05.887
You give up everything that is not for your progress.

20:06.535 --> 20:10.675
All bad habits drop out automatically.

20:12.624 --> 20:20.974
And these bad habits just remove all the diseases,

20:21.174 --> 20:25.706
all the destructiveness from your body.

20:27.334 --> 20:31.463
Its like this: if I am holding a snake, and there is darkness

20:31.664 --> 20:35.096
and I cant see, and I am obstinate,

20:35.297 --> 20:40.258
I am not going to believe if you tell me its a snake.

20:42.186 --> 20:49.374
And unless and until the snake bites, I won't give it up.

20:51.621 --> 20:54.663
But if there is little light, even little light,

20:54.864 --> 21:00.614
immediately I will throw away the snake on my own.

21:02.309 --> 21:08.012
That is why enlightenment is the most important thing.

21:08.858 --> 21:10.925
If you want to save the world,

21:11.126 --> 21:14.737
it is important that we should take to our enlightenment

21:14.938 --> 21:19.487
and give enlightenment to others.

21:20.252 --> 21:24.896
As a result of this, your attention becomes absolutely innocent,

21:25.097 --> 21:29.214
devoid of lust and greed.

21:31.253 --> 21:33.865
Innocence is an eternal thing,

21:34.066 --> 21:38.693
but we have covered it with some clouds.

21:40.079 --> 21:44.028
It is never destroyed,

21:44.229 --> 21:50.920
and it comes back as soon as you get your enlightenment.

21:53.739 --> 21:56.688
So your attention becomes not only innocent

21:56.889 --> 22:00.576
but very powerful and active.

22:01.284 --> 22:05.760
Wherever you put attention, it acts.

22:06.874 --> 22:11.717
Such a person emits joy and peace.

22:14.621 --> 22:18.777
Then you know the absolute Truth.

22:19.396 --> 22:23.861
That means everybody knows the same truth.

22:24.501 --> 22:27.204
Supposing if you have ten children who are realized souls

22:27.405 --> 22:29.118
and tie their eyes,

22:29.319 --> 22:31.615
and ask them what is wrong with this person,

22:31.816 --> 22:35.863
they will all lift the same fingers.

22:36.425 --> 22:39.834
So in our awareness, a new dimension is created

22:40.034 --> 22:45.500
called as vibratory awareness.

22:46.051 --> 22:50.763
Many people don't believe in God. But if you want to know,

22:50.964 --> 22:53.787
you just put your hands and ask, Is there God?

22:53.996 --> 22:59.541
And immediately you start getting tremendous cool breeze in your hands.

23:00.142 --> 23:05.222
And if you, say, want to find out was Christ the son of God,

23:05.423 --> 23:11.451
you just find out. And it is true because you get the cool breeze.

23:12.284 --> 23:18.617
But if there is falsehood, if there is a false master,

23:18.818 --> 23:21.497
you can immediately make it out because you get heat,

23:21.698 --> 23:25.819
sometimes pins and needles.

23:27.478 --> 23:31.517
Everybody knows the same.

23:34.368 --> 23:39.770
Then the greatest thing that happens to you

23:39.971 --> 23:44.884
[is] that you become collectively conscious.

23:45.753 --> 23:50.251
Because you can feel the vibrations of another person,

23:50.452 --> 23:56.592
and you can feel the chakras, the centers of another person also.

23:57.430 --> 24:01.462
Then who is the other?

24:02.550 --> 24:07.231
Like a microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

24:07.432 --> 24:12.963
Microcosm becomes a macrocosm.

24:13.243 --> 24:17.820
Like a drop becomes the ocean.

24:18.028 --> 24:28.753
And such love, pure love and compassion flows in them.

24:30.619 --> 24:36.148
Then you understand the value of another person also,

24:36.650 --> 24:41.263
and also your own value.

24:41.464 --> 24:46.617
But you become humble.

24:46.817 --> 24:53.114
You can give realization to others. You can cure others.

24:54.454 --> 25:00.415
That is how one enlightened light can enlighten other lights.

25:01.097 --> 25:04.113
It's a natural process.

25:04.314 --> 25:06.935
Just like a seed. If you put it in the Mother Earth,

25:07.136 --> 25:11.104
it sprouts by itself.

25:11.757 --> 25:14.637
Because in the seed it is built in to sprout

25:14.838 --> 25:20.291
and it is in the Mother Earth the power is there to sprout.

25:20.924 --> 25:25.111
This is how everything is built in within you.

25:26.407 --> 25:31.149
It is spontaneous, means Sahaj.

25:31.350 --> 25:36.308
Means it is born with you, this right to have this union, yoga,

25:36.509 --> 25:40.509
with this divine Power.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.610
When we think, we think about the past or the future.

25:45.811 --> 25:50.492
We cannot be in the present which is the reality.

25:51.202 --> 25:53.682
We think about the future and past,

25:53.883 --> 25:58.039
and we cannot be in reality, which is the present.

26:00.022 --> 26:04.880
Because the past is finished [and] the future doesn't exist.

26:05.895 --> 26:09.109
But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts

26:09.310 --> 26:13.302
and establishes the silence in between them.

26:14.361 --> 26:19.752
That time you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware.

26:20.110 --> 26:24.571
You are aware but you are thoughtless.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.444
You want to think, you can think. You don't want to think,

26:28.644 --> 26:32.305
you need not think.

26:34.206 --> 26:38.238
But inspirations start coming.

26:41.258 --> 26:46.319
This state is the state of peace within yourself.

26:47.625 --> 26:50.188
You become a witness of the whole drama,

26:50.389 --> 26:55.272
and you become extremely peaceful within yourself.

26:55.951 --> 27:00.197
There is no stress, there is no strain.

27:02.425 --> 27:07.103
You become so free of all these things.

27:08.344 --> 27:12.687
Actually, you become your own master.

27:18.859 --> 27:24.279
Last of all, the greatest thing that happens to you

27:24.480 --> 27:29.847
[is] that you jump into the ocean of joy.

27:31.833 --> 27:39.569
When you are happy or unhappy, these are two sides of a coin.

27:40.838 --> 27:42.866
When your ego is pampered, you are happy;

27:43.067 --> 27:47.801
when it is punctured, you are unhappy.

27:48.283 --> 27:52.289
But joy is singular.

27:54.123 --> 28:00.975
And it's a state in which you transcend all these limitations

28:01.176 --> 28:05.277
of your conditionings.

28:05.478 --> 28:10.145
For example, we have huge gatherings in India

28:10.346 --> 28:14.501
of people who have become saints

28:11.501 --> 28:15.728
fighting, nothing of the kind.

28:14.702 --> 28:17.900
and it is surprising [that] I have never seen them quarreling,

28:25.198 --> 28:30.217
It's a state in which you realize your importance,

28:30.418 --> 28:34.637
your glory and the glory of others.

28:36.370 --> 28:40.436
Its all your own.

28:40.637 --> 28:44.720
It's all within you.

28:44.921 --> 28:51.337
This power, what we call Kundalini, is in the sacrum bone

28:51.538 --> 28:56.709
that means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.

28:58.516 --> 29:06.385
Now this power of yours is the power of pure desire.

29:07.510 --> 29:11.129
All other desires are not pure.

29:12.826 --> 29:16.673
Today we ask for a house, we get it. Then we try to get a car,

29:16.873 --> 29:19.429
then we want to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane

29:19.629 --> 29:23.933
I mean there is no end to it.

29:24.912 --> 29:26.860
It is not satiable.

29:27.061 --> 29:30.080
In general, they say, wants are not satiable.

29:30.281 --> 29:34.293
Economics says so.

29:35.390 --> 29:37.995
So whether you are aware or not aware,

29:38.196 --> 29:44.581
this power of pure desire in within you.

29:45.407 --> 29:49.674
And once you get connected with this all-pervading Power,

29:49.875 --> 29:54.156
all your problems get solved.

29:54.728 --> 29:57.754
Even economic

29:57.955 --> 30:01.115
[and] political.

30:01.316 --> 30:07.605
Because most of the world problems come from human beings.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.397
And all the human problems come from these chakras,

30:11.598 --> 30:15.670
from these centers.

30:16.210 --> 30:19.706
If these centers are somehow or other corrected,

30:19.907 --> 30:24.949
the whole world can be a beautiful place to live in.

30:27.350 --> 30:31.665
By talking about peace or having organizations of peace,

30:31.866 --> 30:35.733
you cannot have peace.

30:36.405 --> 30:39.034
I have known people who have got awards in peace

30:39.235 --> 30:44.336
and [are] absolutely very hot tempered, very.

30:45.317 --> 30:50.277
They never even smile. They never even smile.

30:51.129 --> 30:56.762
And if you have to approach them, it is better to go through a barge pole.

30:56.963 --> 31:01.387
I dont know how they get peace awards.

31:02.194 --> 31:06.507
You have to have peace within.

31:09.063 --> 31:15.321
In this short lecture I dont think I can tell you everything about it.

31:17.404 --> 31:20.845
But like in this beautiful hall you have so many lights.

31:21.046 --> 31:25.079
Only you have to switch on, thats all.

31:25.359 --> 31:29.259
But if I go on telling you about the history of this electricity,

31:29.460 --> 31:33.781
how it came here, it is so boring.

31:33.982 --> 31:38.615
So why not get it, enlightenment?

31:38.936 --> 31:41.908
It is so easy.

31:42.109 --> 31:46.382
You cant pay for it, you must understand this.

31:47.113 --> 31:51.233
God doesn't understand money.

31:51.442 --> 31:55.871
He doesn't understand banking that's our headache.

31:57.331 --> 32:02.276
I don't know how people can sell God in the market.

32:04.488 --> 32:07.836
Its all right [that] you can pay for this hall, all right.

32:08.037 --> 32:11.662
But not for your Realization.

32:16.671 --> 32:22.591
It will hardly take 15 minutes for you to get your Realization.

32:23.864 --> 32:28.915
You are feeling warm, but after that you will feel very cool.

32:29.649 --> 32:33.688
But as I said, I cannot force on you.

32:34.248 --> 32:38.306
If you don't want, I cannot do it.

32:38.733 --> 32:43.539
So those who do not want to have, have to go out.

32:44.186 --> 32:49.253
It is not mental; it is beyond the mind.

32:50.028 --> 32:53.117
So even My lecture is just an introduction,

32:53.317 --> 32:57.642
but it is not the happening.

32:57.938 --> 33:02.290
Happening is the actualization,

33:02.491 --> 33:07.218
I would say the actualization of your baptism.

33:07.419 --> 33:11.658
It's the experience, it is not just talking.

33:12.626 --> 33:17.278
And you all can have this experience,

33:17.696 --> 33:22.018
not at all difficult.

33:22.265 --> 33:29.820
You dont have to think about it, just it will work automatically.

33:31.344 --> 33:36.687
There is no problem of any kind that you will face.

33:38.783 --> 33:44.892
I feel Brazil can do very well in Sahaja Yoga

33:46.178 --> 33:51.600
because people are faithful and simple-hearted.

33:53.406 --> 33:59.242
As in Russia I found they have no conditioning of any kind.

34:00.123 --> 34:08.311
At least 65 to 70% people are very sensitive to spirituality.

34:08.830 --> 34:12.721
The rest are stupid I must say.

34:13.392 --> 34:17.227
They are taking to American culture of Coca-Cola and all that.

34:17.428 --> 34:22.138
They want Marlboro cigarettes.

34:27.655 --> 34:30.053
In Russia, in one place called Togliatti,

34:30.254 --> 34:35.543
we have got about 21.000 Sahaja Yogis.

34:37.159 --> 34:42.228
And also the government is very good there, I mean the universities.

34:42.429 --> 34:48.523
They have thrown away all other false gurus from there, everyone.

34:49.577 --> 34:52.444
Surprisingly, they awarded Me

34:52.645 --> 34:55.940
the award of the St. Petersburg university,

34:56.141 --> 35:00.376
which was the oldest university,

35:01.108 --> 35:05.158
as the honorary academician which were only ten so far.

35:05.359 --> 35:08.968
I am the tenth.

35:10.016 --> 35:13.531
And one of them is Einstein.

35:14.399 --> 35:17.618
One of them is Enstein.

35:18.844 --> 35:21.534
I was quite surprised, you know. So I said,

35:21.735 --> 35:26.759
Why do you include Me with Einstein? He was such a great scientist.

35:27.665 --> 35:30.364
So they said that, Mother, what Einstein has done

35:30.565 --> 35:33.099
is only on the matter. You are working on human beings.

35:33.299 --> 35:37.937
So they have given Me such a high award.

35:38.764 --> 35:42.898
I said, I am not doing anything. Actually, they have their own powers,

35:43.099 --> 35:45.920
and they are getting awakened to it. What am I doing about it?

35:46.121 --> 35:48.850
I don't know.

35:49.773 --> 35:55.551
But they are very sensitive people. There were 2000 scientists

35:56.297 --> 35:59.898
in that conference.

36:00.647 --> 36:03.135
They dont have much conditionings.

36:03.336 --> 36:07.429
I think they are people who are like clean slate.

36:07.630 --> 36:10.548
- Like? - Like clean slate,

36:10.749 --> 36:14.974
Clean slate, on which we write, clean slate.

36:17.393 --> 36:21.713
And it has worked really wonders there.

36:25.549 --> 36:28.807
So, I would request those who do not want to have

36:29.008 --> 36:31.105
their Self Realization should leave the hall

36:31.306 --> 36:35.798
because it is not proper to disturb in-between.

36:36.679 --> 36:39.551
But after Realization,

36:39.759 --> 36:52.010
one should not sort of get dissolved into that and do not grow.

36:52.991 --> 37:00.382
Because it is in the beginning you will feel really on top of the world.

37:00.583 --> 37:03.583
But you have to grow.

37:04.991 --> 37:10.042
You have to grow in the collective.

37:10.243 --> 37:15.673
You cannot grow in your houses or your homes, or in your rooms.

37:16.600 --> 37:20.643
But you don't have to give up anything.

37:21.129 --> 37:26.074
You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your heads

37:26.894 --> 37:31.277
or go to Gobi Desert to get nirvana.

37:32.488 --> 37:36.879
Here, on your seats, you will get your Realization.

37:38.209 --> 37:43.251
Don't have to give up your family, don't have to give up anything.

37:43.452 --> 37:47.624
You don't have to change your dress or anything.

37:48.513 --> 37:54.895
In Chicago I met a gentleman, the head of the Hare Rama.

37:55.096 --> 38:00.526
He was wearing a dhoti, what we wear in India, a dhoti.

38:01.337 --> 38:07.572
Specially that day it was very cold in Chicago.

38:08.740 --> 38:12.260
I said, Why do you wear a dhoti in this cold? Its terribly cold.

38:12.461 --> 38:16.523
As a mother, I feel concerned.

38:17.365 --> 38:21.771
He said, My guru has initiated me like this.

38:22.325 --> 38:24.914
I said, Do you think that by wearing this dhoti

38:25.115 --> 38:29.115
you will get your nirvana?

38:29.666 --> 38:33.530
80% people in India wear dhotis and go on saying,

38:33.730 --> 38:38.979
Hare Rama, hare Krishna. Are they all going to get nirvana?

38:39.694 --> 38:44.312
I mean if they all go to heaven, where will you be?

38:45.969 --> 38:50.953
It is the internal change that is needed, not outward.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.573
I think you all are intelligent people, and you will understand

38:54.774 --> 38:58.013
what I am saying.

39:00.335 --> 39:02.495
We don't have any organization.

39:02.695 --> 39:05.619
We don't have any priesthood. We have no hierarchies.

39:05.819 --> 39:09.497
Nothing of the kind. Everybody is equally the same.

39:10.806 --> 39:13.845
I have no secretary. I travel every day, practically.

39:14.046 --> 39:17.997
Tomorrow I am going to Sao Paulo and then I am going to other places.

39:18.198 --> 39:22.372
Everyday practically I am travelling.

39:22.812 --> 39:26.988
But I don't think I am travelling. I don't think.

39:27.189 --> 39:31.795
I will be 72 years of age [but] I dont feel tired.

39:33.702 --> 39:40.468
I am the same because I feel tremendous love for all of you.

39:41.293 --> 39:45.043
That compels Me to travel.

39:47.636 --> 39:52.252
And that love itself is so nourishing

39:52.557 --> 39:55.757
and so joy giving.

39:56.029 --> 39:59.847
Same thing you all can have.

40:00.048 --> 40:03.892
You all can have the same powers.

40:04.093 --> 40:08.929
These are your potential things which you must get.

40:20.148 --> 40:26.984
Now, this mother Kundalini, She knows everything about you.

40:27.185 --> 40:31.974
Like a tape recorder, She has taped everything. She knows you.

40:32.850 --> 40:35.588
She knows what mistakes you have committed,

40:35.789 --> 40:40.306
She knows what are your aspirations, She knows you.

40:40.951 --> 40:44.953
So please dont judge yourself.

40:47.618 --> 40:53.311
She knows and She is anxious to give you your second birth.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.752
So just understand

40:56.953 --> 41:04.455
that you should not feel at all in any way diffident.

41:04.693 --> 41:08.975
You must have complete respect for yourself.

41:09.802 --> 41:14.103
That means you should not feel guilty at all.

41:15.566 --> 41:18.238
This is the first condition that

41:18.439 --> 41:24.519
please don't feel guilty about anything that has happened in the past.

41:25.046 --> 41:29.991
Past is finished, we are in the present.

41:31.384 --> 41:34.298
So this is a very important condition because if you feel guilty,

41:34.499 --> 41:40.447
the center on the left-hand side is in jeopardy.

41:40.988 --> 41:49.745
So you may get Spondylitis, you may get Angina,

41:49.946 --> 41:53.758
you may get Tuberculosis

41:54.530 --> 41:58.756
or, could be, lethargic organs.

41:59.052 --> 42:01.324
So what is the use of feeling guilty

42:01.525 --> 42:05.963
and troubling yourself like this?

42:07.312 --> 42:14.158
The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone

42:14.359 --> 42:18.348
even without thinking about them.

42:19.208 --> 42:21.231
As this center is caught up,

42:21.432 --> 42:25.129
the Kundalini cannot rise above this center.

42:27.279 --> 42:33.595
Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

42:33.796 --> 42:36.424
It is a myth.

42:36.625 --> 42:39.129
Because if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

42:39.330 --> 42:43.291
and torture yourself.

42:43.968 --> 42:45.926
Specially at this moment.

42:46.134 --> 42:51.550
The center on the optic chiasma is like this, absolutely constricted.

42:52.467 --> 42:56.560
And if you don't forgive, it won't open out.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.305
And at this moment,

42:59.506 --> 43:02.681
you will miss the great opportunity of Self Realization

43:02.882 --> 43:07.725
because Kundalini won't be able to pass through that center.

43:08.289 --> 43:11.495
Also, don't think about people whom you have to forgive

43:11.696 --> 43:18.756
because it is a very painful, I think, sometimes.

43:18.957 --> 43:22.379
You get a headache.

43:23.355 --> 43:27.363
In general, you have to forgive.

43:28.540 --> 43:34.142
The third condition is very simple. You have to take out your shoes.

43:35.754 --> 43:38.735
In England, first time I said please take out your shoes,

43:38.936 --> 43:42.881
so half the people walked off.

44:16.700 --> 44:19.367
You have been already told about the subtle centers

44:19.568 --> 44:23.519
and the channels that we have within ourselves.

44:25.001 --> 44:30.562
So now we have two powers  left and right.

44:30.787 --> 44:33.094
The left one is the power of desire,

44:33.295 --> 44:36.959
the right one is the power of action.

44:38.332 --> 44:41.792
Is a mundane desire,

44:42.555 --> 44:46.063
everyday desire.

44:48.725 --> 44:55.680
Now, so those who are sitting on the chair,

44:55.881 --> 44:58.023
not those who are sitting on the ground they are all right,

44:58.224 --> 45:02.685
have to put both their feet apart from each other.

45:03.077 --> 45:08.593
And put the left hand on your left lap, that's all.

45:08.874 --> 45:12.889
And we have to nourish our centers with our right hand.

45:15.382 --> 45:20.479
Only for tonight we have to do, is not to be repeated.

45:24.196 --> 45:26.612
Now we will show you what is to be done,

45:26.813 --> 45:30.394
is to put the left hand like this, which symbolizes that

45:30.603 --> 45:34.588
you desire to have your Self Realization.

45:36.567 --> 45:41.099
All right. So please put the left hand like this.

45:42.598 --> 45:47.427
Now the right hand you have to put it first on your heart

45:48.281 --> 45:53.203
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

45:55.303 --> 45:59.900
If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide,

46:00.101 --> 46:03.655
your own master.

46:04.469 --> 46:06.747
So, we work only on the left-hand side.

46:06.948 --> 46:09.201
Put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen

46:09.402 --> 46:13.565
on the left-hand side.

46:14.221 --> 46:16.896
This is the center of your mastery

46:17.097 --> 46:21.359
created by great prophets and seers.

46:23.179 --> 46:25.995
Now you take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

46:26.196 --> 46:29.946
on the left-hand side.

46:31.135 --> 46:37.159
This is the center, surprisingly, is of pure divine Knowledge.

46:38.347 --> 46:40.460
Now you take your right hand to the upper portion

46:40.661 --> 46:44.590
of your abdomen again.

46:44.952 --> 46:49.194
Then take it on your heart.

46:50.264 --> 46:54.888
And then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

46:57.568 --> 47:02.083
and turn your head to your right.

47:02.643 --> 47:08.987
This center is not all right. Please don't feel guilty.

47:11.765 --> 47:18.144
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across like this

47:18.345 --> 47:22.119
and bend your head slowly.

47:25.263 --> 47:30.122
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head

47:30.460 --> 47:34.217
and push back your head.

47:35.829 --> 47:39.114
Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

47:39.314 --> 47:45.009
you have to ask for forgiveness from the divine Power.

47:47.862 --> 47:49.909
Now the last center is important.

47:50.110 --> 47:53.893
Stretch your palm as far as possible.

47:55.432 --> 47:59.692
Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area

47:59.892 --> 48:04.345
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

48:04.608 --> 48:08.952
Now push back your fingers as far as possible.

48:09.620 --> 48:13.065
Now please put down your head.

48:13.549 --> 48:16.026
Here you have to move your scalp

48:16.227 --> 48:20.892
slowly seven times clockwise.

48:21.878 --> 48:27.386
Please push back your fingers otherwise there will be no pressure.

48:27.789 --> 48:31.703
And bend your heads please.

48:34.158 --> 48:37.867
Please move it seven times.

48:38.430 --> 48:42.367
That's all we have to do.

48:45.573 --> 48:49.850
Now we will start by closing our eyes.

48:50.050 --> 48:55.355
Please don't open your eyes until and unless I tell you.

48:56.541 --> 49:01.188
Please put your feet apart from each other

49:01.388 --> 49:05.732
and let hand on your left lap.

49:10.635 --> 49:15.385
And put your right hand on your heart.

49:17.479 --> 49:22.226
You can take out your spectacles and close your eyes.

49:25.234 --> 49:29.594
Please don't open till I tell you.

49:31.535 --> 49:36.007
Here resides the Spirit.

49:36.207 --> 49:38.514
So you have to ask a fundamental question

49:38.714 --> 49:42.885
about yourself three times to Me.

49:48.986 --> 49:54.928
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

49:58.264 --> 50:05.454
So please say it three times in your heart, "Mother", ask the question,

50:05.655 --> 50:10.289
Mother, am I the Spirit?

50:22.092 --> 50:25.197
I have told you already that if you become the Spirit,

50:25.397 --> 50:30.166
you become your own guide, your own master.

50:35.026 --> 50:37.982
So now please take your right hand in the upper portion

50:38.182 --> 50:44.477
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it with your fingers.

50:50.390 --> 50:53.729
Here you ask Me another question in your heart,

50:53.929 --> 50:58.358
very fundamental, about yourself.

51:04.546 --> 51:11.184
Please ask, Mother, am I my own master?

51:18.496 --> 51:22.843
I've already told you that I respect your freedom

51:23.043 --> 51:26.936
and I cannot force on you your Self Realization.

51:27.136 --> 51:34.291
In the same way, I cannot force pure divine Knowledge on you.

51:44.973 --> 51:48.680
So please take down your right hand in the lower portion

51:48.880 --> 51:53.248
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

51:57.459 --> 52:11.033
Here you have to say again I mean you have to ask six times

52:11.233 --> 52:15.444
because the center has got six petals.

52:22.184 --> 52:25.163
So ask six times,

52:25.363 --> 52:31.082
Mother, please give me pure divine Knowledge.

52:38.058 --> 52:43.823
This is the knowledge about the science of divine Laws,

52:48.606 --> 52:53.824
which you get spontaneously, automatically on your nerves.

52:57.786 --> 53:02.735
As soon as you ask the question for divine Knowledge,

53:02.935 --> 53:07.349
the Kundalini starts rising upward.

53:11.598 --> 53:14.855
So you have to nourish the upper centers

53:15.056 --> 53:19.728
with your full self-confidence.

53:24.262 --> 53:26.577
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion

53:26.777 --> 53:31.980
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

53:38.962 --> 53:45.232
Here you have to say ten times with full confidence,

53:45.432 --> 53:50.705
Mother, I am my own master.

53:59.195 --> 54:05.652
I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind,

54:05.852 --> 54:11.512
this intellect, these emotions, these conditionings, this ego,

54:11.712 --> 54:16.037
but you are the pure Spirit.

54:25.541 --> 54:28.716
So now raise your right hand on top of your heart

54:28.916 --> 54:34.049
and here you have to say again with full self-confidence.

54:41.388 --> 54:49.453
Say it will full confidence, Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

54:49.653 --> 54:52.035
That you are, have faith in it and say it,

54:52.235 --> 54:56.734
Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

55:04.523 --> 55:11.479
This all-pervading Power of divine Love

55:11.679 --> 55:21.380
is the ocean of knowledge and bliss.

55:27.967 --> 55:34.068
It is the ocean of energy of compassion and love.

55:37.741 --> 55:45.098
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

55:48.027 --> 55:51.796
and whatever mistakes you might have committed

55:51.996 --> 55:54.192
can be easily dissolved

55:54.393 --> 56:00.455
by the power of this ocean of compassion and forgiveness.

56:07.967 --> 56:12.070
You must have faith in yourself.

56:13.828 --> 56:18.821
So, forgive yourself and put your hand, right hand

56:19.021 --> 56:21.243
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

56:21.443 --> 56:25.584
and turn your head to your right.

56:35.715 --> 56:41.650
Now, with full confidence you have to say sixteen times,

56:41.850 --> 56:47.867
Mother, I am not guilty at all. Have confidence.

56:57.297 --> 57:03.305
I have already told you that

57:03.505 --> 57:08.899
whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

57:12.820 --> 57:17.625
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

57:22.074 --> 57:25.928
and torture yourself.

57:26.128 --> 57:28.638
Specially at this moment if you don't forgive,

57:28.838 --> 57:31.299
the center of Agnya won't open and your Kundalini

57:31.499 --> 57:35.858
will not be able to penetrate.

57:42.573 --> 57:45.435
So now raise your hand to your forehead across

57:45.635 --> 57:51.314
and put down your head as far as possible.

58:00.087 --> 58:04.759
Here you have to say again with self-confidence,

58:04.959 --> 58:09.524
but not how many times from your heart,

58:15.149 --> 58:20.124
Mother, I forgive everyone in general.

58:28.304 --> 58:32.850
Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

58:33.050 --> 58:35.222
just for your satisfaction,

58:35.423 --> 58:42.139
you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading divine Power.

58:51.544 --> 58:58.688
So now please raise your right hand on the back side of your head

58:58.888 --> 59:02.930
and push back your head as far as possible.

59:12.055 --> 59:14.410
Here you have to say, again from your heart,

59:14.610 --> 59:18.821
not how many times,

59:22.473 --> 59:26.995
just for your justification,

59:28.684 --> 59:34.098
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

59:37.129 --> 59:44.284
Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive them.

59:55.932 --> 59:59.115
Now the last center as I said is very important.

59:59.315 --> 01:00:05.760
You have to stretch your palm fully and

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:12.720
put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area,

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:17.662
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:00:32.704 --> 01:00:37.165
Now stretch back your fingers as far as possible

01:00:40.656 --> 01:00:44.789
and please put down your head as far as possible.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:53.002
With a pressure you have to move

01:00:53.202 --> 01:00:58.515
your scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

01:01:06.593 --> 01:01:09.932
Here again I cannot force Self Realization on you.

01:01:10.132 --> 01:01:15.792
So you have to ask for it saying seven times while moving your hand,

01:01:15.992 --> 01:01:20.578
Mother, please give me my Self Realization.

01:02:12.944 --> 01:02:18.069
Now please take down your hand.

01:02:19.754 --> 01:02:23.840
Slowly open your eyes.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:28.522
Put both the hands towards Me like this

01:02:30.878 --> 01:02:34.690
and watch Me without thinking.

01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:44.417
Now put the right hand towards Me like this

01:02:44.617 --> 01:02:48.347
and put down your head, and with the left hand

01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:53.714
try to see if there is a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

01:02:53.914 --> 01:02:58.438
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

01:03:12.123 --> 01:03:17.302
Now, please put the left hand.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:25.062
Also, bend your head, it is important.

01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:28.308
Now again see with the right hand.

01:03:28.508 --> 01:03:32.472
Not on top of your head, away from your fontanelle bone.

01:03:32.672 --> 01:03:38.817
If there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming.

01:03:48.304 --> 01:03:54.866
Sometimes they are cool, sometimes they are hot.

01:03:58.897 --> 01:04:02.998
They could be close or away.

01:04:03.982 --> 01:04:07.434
But if you have not forgiven yourself or others,

01:04:07.634 --> 01:04:11.587
you get the hot breeze.

01:04:14.822 --> 01:04:21.232
So now again please try to forgive everyone, yourself also.

01:04:26.021 --> 01:04:31.272
Now please put again your right hand towards Me

01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:35.643
and see with the left hand.

01:04:38.733 --> 01:04:41.627
You have to move your hand because sometimes it is far,

01:04:41.827 --> 01:04:45.804
sometimes it is closer.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.907
It is coming out of your fontanelle bone area,

01:04:52.107 --> 01:04:56.552
so please have faith in yourself.

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:04.566
Please bend your head, bend your head, otherwise.

01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:16.040
Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this,

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.139
push back your head.

01:05:24.967 --> 01:05:31.011
Now, here you can ask one of these three questions three times,

01:05:31.211 --> 01:05:34.532
one of them.

01:05:40.361 --> 01:05:46.635
The first one is, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:05:51.008 --> 01:05:55.000
Ask three times.

01:05:55.812 --> 01:06:02.888
Second one is, Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of divine Love, Ruh?

01:06:08.383 --> 01:06:13.266
The third one is, Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:19.625
Ask any one of these three times.

01:06:22.477 --> 01:06:28.990
This is the first time you are feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

01:06:32.693 --> 01:06:37.139
Now please bring down your hands.

01:06:39.178 --> 01:06:44.248
All those who have felt

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:54.289
cool breeze on the fingertips,

01:06:54.489 --> 01:06:57.397
or may be hot,

01:06:57.598 --> 01:07:02.082
same on the palms

01:07:04.308 --> 01:07:11.628
or out of their fontanelle bone area,

01:07:15.495 --> 01:07:19.323
please raise both your hands.

01:07:24.276 --> 01:07:26.561
What do you say to that?

01:07:26.761 --> 01:07:30.871
I bow to you all.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:40.168
Most of you have become saints now, so I bow to you.

01:07:47.337 --> 01:07:50.825
Please put down your hands.

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:57.128
All those who have felt the cool breeze,

01:07:57.328 --> 01:08:03.960
this all-pervading Power of divine Love, have to grow into it.

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:14.950
Some of you may not have felt.

01:08:17.544 --> 01:08:22.889
Maybe something physically, mentally wrong with you,

01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:29.494
maybe spiritually.

01:08:29.694 --> 01:08:33.850
Or maybe you are thinking too much.

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:39.563
Or maybe you did not forgive,

01:08:39.764 --> 01:08:44.134
you do not forgive yourself and others.

01:08:44.334 --> 01:08:47.275
Whatever it is,

01:08:47.475 --> 01:08:51.264
everything can be corrected.

01:08:52.053 --> 01:08:57.636
Respect your Realization

01:09:01.066 --> 01:09:05.134
and grow into it.

01:09:05.334 --> 01:09:09.626
Most surprising thing is that when I come,

01:09:09.826 --> 01:09:15.459
so many of you come here and get your Realization.

01:09:22.006 --> 01:09:26.114
But I am a foreigner, I am an Indian

01:09:28.515 --> 01:09:32.288
and you trust Me so much.

01:09:34.518 --> 01:09:39.322
But we have here very beautiful Sahaja Yogis.

01:09:43.061 --> 01:09:52.108
They will not take any money and you can grow.

01:09:54.026 --> 01:09:57.909
They'll tell you all about it,

01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:03.650
complete knowledge.

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:07.290
So when I go away, you should not

01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:12.360
just give up, you have to grow.

01:10:16.455 --> 01:10:20.458
Otherwise, it would be like the parable of Christ that

01:10:20.658 --> 01:10:26.461
some seeds fell on the barren land

01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:32.434
and some on the marshy land which just sprouted and were finished.

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:45.871
It's a very great responsibility

01:10:47.273 --> 01:10:52.140
that you are born in this special time.

01:10:54.519 --> 01:10:58.675
Then you have got your Realization.

01:10:59.668 --> 01:11:02.686
And it's only you, the enlightened ones,

01:11:02.886 --> 01:11:06.334
who can save the world.

01:11:09.873 --> 01:11:14.798
Make the world beautiful for your children.

01:11:16.579 --> 01:11:22.040
So please understand your own worth and value.

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:28.340
Now, please know your identity that

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:33.220
you have entered into the kingdom of God.

01:11:37.979 --> 01:11:41.964
Life would be full of blessings.

01:11:43.557 --> 01:11:48.517
But please grow and give it to others.

01:11:52.752 --> 01:11:56.206
Have faith in yourself.

01:11:56.406 --> 01:12:01.859
My message is, now enjoy yourself and enjoy others.

01:12:05.369 --> 01:12:10.096
May God bless you all.

01:13:06.443 --> 01:13:11.318
Thank you very much. Thank you.
