1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:03,579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:12,634
 I was overjoyed to see

3
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:20,633
the way you had organized this beautiful welcome.

4
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:30,743
I must say that it’s your love which finds

5
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:41,568
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:51,788
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

7
00:00:52,114 --> 00:01:00,137
come to your heads, and you represent

8
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:05,877
the different countries from where you have come.

9
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:14,975
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

10
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:20,161
and tell them the message that the time has come

11
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:26,978
 for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

12
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,045
We have to rise above this human level

13
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:36,870
to a higher level of existence.

14
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:42,825
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

15
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:51,526
 how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

16
00:01:51,773 --> 00:02:04,880
 and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

17
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:13,044
 which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

18
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:22,373
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

19
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,270
 the joy of others, the happiness of others.

20
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:35,059
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

21
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,846
 you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

22
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:47,908
You have already done it, and gradually once

23
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:54,334
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

24
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:59,587
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

25
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:05,273
so very important that all others in your countries

26
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:13,854
 also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

27
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:18,799
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

28
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:25,048
 the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

29
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:32,501
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

30
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,835
 and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

31
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:43,997
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

32
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:52,133
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

33
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:56,816
you go beyond all the three gunas.

34
00:03:57,123 --> 00:04:06,175
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

35
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:17,357
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

36
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,099
Your attention moves from there to the second style

37
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:28,475
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

38
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,408
they want to do something, want to show something,

39
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:35,986
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

40
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,954
All this struggle just disappears.

41
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:42,114
"Atit" means beyond.

42
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:48,050
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

43
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:53,736
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

44
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:57,568
and you just hate that kind of life

45
00:04:57,593 --> 00:05:03,123
 and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

46
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:05,959
That also is finished.

47
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:12,987
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

48
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:20,172
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

49
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:27,660
 because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

50
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:33,873
 you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

51
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:41,702
So you become a person who is beyond this.

52
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:49,584
This is something very remarkable as far as

53
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:54,273
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

54
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:57,044
You just enjoy being yourself.

55
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:03,613
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

56
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:08,281
But what happens is that you just go beyond

57
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:12,043
all these three gunas which have been

58
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:17,707
dominating you this way or that way.

59
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:27,831
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

60
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:38,792
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

61
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:43,171
I know today I was late somehow.

62
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,863
It just works out that way.

63
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:48,186
But you didn’t miss the time.

64
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:51,966
You were still enjoying.
 I could see, sitting in the house,

65
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:54,837
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

66
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:57,875
all of you are enjoying nicely.

67
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,795
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

68
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:04,318
This is beyond time.

69
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,689
You’re not bound by time.

70
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:10,663
Whatever is the time is your own, because

71
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,393
you are standing in the present,

72
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:19,024
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

73
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:22,683
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

74
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,660
 or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

75
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:28,929
Here you were just enjoying,

76
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:33,826
 enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

77
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:38,755
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

78
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:42,009
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

79
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:45,333
 that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

80
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:49,362
So at this moment you are here sitting,

81
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,331
 perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

82
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:57,688
 just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

83
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,990
 of your connections with others.

84
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:05,014
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

85
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:08,172
 how you are enjoying this.

86
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:12,149
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

87
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:14,871
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

88
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:16,736
What is the problem?

89
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:23,213
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

90
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:27,099
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

91
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,976
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

92
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,229
 no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

93
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:38,615
they were so shy and so much worried.

94
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:43,388
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

95
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:46,150
 that My car failed on the way and

96
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:49,989
I was delayed in going.

97
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:57,926
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

98
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,151
and we were stranded on the road.

99
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:05,172
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

100
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:11,091
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

101
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:16,279
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

102
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:20,273
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

103
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,170
Otherwise they would not.

104
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,555
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

105
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,147
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

106
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:35,543
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

107
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:41,239
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
 so it’s our responsibility.”

108
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:44,803
In that way they took the responsibility.

109
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:50,261
So when you are beyond the time,
 you become responsible for that moment.

110
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:55,765
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

111
00:09:56,122 --> 00:10:01,014
means you just all of you become responsible.

112
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:06,086
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

113
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:09,549
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

114
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,436
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

115
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:19,666
 all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

116
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:26,964
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

117
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:29,588
The time cannot bow you down.

118
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:33,591
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

119
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:37,026
 they would have thrown stones on My car,

120
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:42,788
 thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

121
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,213
They would have resented.

122
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:48,637
But not the people who are beyond time.

123
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,886
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

124
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:57,607
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

125
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:05,384
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

126
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:13,416
 beyond your human nature.

127
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,832
That means whatever you do is religious,

128
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:25,591
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

129
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:30,353
If, say, you are in a business,

130
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:34,614
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

131
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:39,624
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

132
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:44,076
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

133
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,695
but you are beyond it.

134
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:55,590
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

135
00:11:56,058 --> 00:12:00,588
 they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

136
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,777
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

137
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:10,625
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

138
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,287
But not you.

139
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:15,511
For you, you are always in dhyan,

140
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:20,138
 always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

141
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,365
you just jump into that awareness

142
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:27,733
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

143
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,160
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

144
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,916
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

145
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,296
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

146
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,802
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

147
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:53,507
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

148
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:56,930
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

149
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:03,389
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

150
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,270
"All right.

151
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:08,466
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

152
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:11,440
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

153
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:14,397
So she said that "You have to be careful

154
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:19,278
that even the spoon should not be used."

155
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:22,435
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

156
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:28,917
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

157
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,095
 who are eating non–veg. food,

158
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:37,672
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

159
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:40,724
So I had to incur all these problems.

160
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,634
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

161
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:46,841
our cook to cook anything for us.

162
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:50,232
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

163
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:53,477
And she made such a nuisance out of her

164
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:57,683
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

165
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:01,907
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

166
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:04,439
 because they are very demanding.

167
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:08,189
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

168
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,253
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

169
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:18,187
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

170
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:21,615
 she was related to something very high up,

171
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:26,287
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

172
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,122
I said, "Really?"

173
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,748
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

174
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:34,295
 we have such people still living.

175
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:39,388
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

176
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,343
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

177
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,130
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

178
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,699
So people had to go and fetch the water,

179
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:55,464
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

180
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:57,846
and then only he could cook.

181
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:01,280
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

182
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:05,791
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

183
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:08,245
 the cook got sick with pneumonia,

184
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,174
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

185
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,446
This lady didn’t mind.

186
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,646
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

187
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:19,925
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

188
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,031
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

189
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,001
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

190
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:30,189
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

191
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:35,762
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

192
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:39,270
 and so much bothering others.”

193
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:42,383
So this self-centeredness comes to us

194
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,256
because we think, "This is our dharma,

195
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:49,886
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

196
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,791
How dare they do not do it?"

197
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:57,300
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

198
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:04,647
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
 we never think.

199
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:07,608
We go on demanding things,

200
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:12,680
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

201
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:15,078
This is what I have to do.”

202
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,404
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

203
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,291
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

204
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,165
who got conditioned like that.

205
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,945
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

206
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:33,154
 and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

207
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:39,613
 and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

208
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:45,008
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

209
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:48,122
And one day she just disappeared.

210
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,318
So they told the police to find out this lady,

211
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:55,250
and when he went to find out the lady,
 the police said that

212
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:58,618
 "We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

213
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:02,208
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

214
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,512
She was still sitting in the church.

215
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,873
Next time again she disappeared.

216
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:08,687
It happened three, four times.

217
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:11,711
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

218
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:17,066
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

219
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:20,526
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

220
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,323
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

221
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:28,196
 they are otherwise very stupid people,

222
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:33,633
 they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

223
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:38,901
 they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

224
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,968
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

225
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,369
That’s the only point where they are sane."

226
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:52,769
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

227
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,595
There was one person I had

228
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:59,801
 who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

229
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,409
So I said, "All right."

230
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,118
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

231
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:06,444
what sort of a place London is.

232
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,234
Now he knew the driving very well,

233
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:13,785
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

234
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:17,654
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

235
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,255
I said, "What’s the matter?

236
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:23,012
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

237
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:26,886
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

238
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,880
One day the police got hold of him.

239
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,380
I was also in the car.

240
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:32,460
He said, "Where are you going?"

241
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,903
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

242
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:39,787
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

243
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:43,571
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

244
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:47,973
So in the old age I have known that these things form

245
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,116
 a kind of a habit,

246
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:53,946
 but in young age also you can find people

247
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:57,097
get so conditioned by their style.

248
00:18:57,188 --> 00:19:02,553
So this is what you can call the human element,

249
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:07,888
 where you get attached or get bothered about something.

250
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:14,620
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

251
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:18,128
 that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

252
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,236
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

253
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:23,781
It goes on, and on, and on.

254
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:29,008
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

255
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:33,718
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

256
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:37,904
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

257
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,752
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

258
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,672
This person has purchased the carpet.

259
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:45,610
What have you got to do?

260
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,313
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

261
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:48,441
Who are you?

262
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:49,927
You have not paid for you.

263
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:53,080
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

264
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:56,408
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

265
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:59,699
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

266
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:03,777
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

267
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:07,018
 but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

268
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,284
"Why?"

269
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:12,187
"I don’t like, that’s all."

270
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,294
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

271
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:26,543
Who are you to like or dislike?

272
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:28,749
What is your position?

273
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,802
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

274
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:37,830
But is very common, specially in the West,

275
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:42,361
 to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

276
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:44,488
"I don’t like India."

277
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:46,616
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

278
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:48,354
Why did you come here?"

279
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:50,529
"I don’t like Turkey."

280
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,124
"Why?"

281
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:57,313
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

282
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,911
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

283
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,367
So you should only wear short skirts.

284
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:08,729
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

285
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:11,957
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

286
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:17,605
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

287
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:22,557
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

288
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,767
you must know that you are not normal human being,

289
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:32,174
 according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

290
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:36,697
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

291
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,777
and your whole attitude has changed.

292
00:21:40,454 --> 00:21:45,126
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

293
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,529
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

294
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:54,382
 and sometimes you talk very profound things.

295
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:58,966
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

296
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:02,920
 because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

297
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:08,405
 all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

298
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:17,677
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

299
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:22,533
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

300
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:29,845
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

301
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:37,592
 a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

302
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:41,749
 “with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

303
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:45,587
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

304
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:51,959
 “you are, you are, you are." You are...

305
00:22:53,396 --> 00:23:00,046
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

306
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:04,768
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

307
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:09,395
 using your brains all the time to criticize others,

308
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:14,981
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

309
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:17,238
People enjoy gossips.

310
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:18,579
Why?

311
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,816
They enjoy gossip

312
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,896
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

313
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,853
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

314
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:33,916
So this understanding, I should say this loving

315
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:38,577
 wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

316
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,632
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

317
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:48,670
 start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

318
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,702
 china shop, you can behave any way.

319
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:55,676
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

320
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:59,911
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

321
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:05,258
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

322
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:11,795
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

323
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:19,583
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

324
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:26,108
So, actually it is not a dharma
 that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

325
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:31,080
It is something very low to be angry with others,

326
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:36,359
 to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

327
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:41,683
 or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

328
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,590
And this doesn’t pay.

329
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:47,345
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

330
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,885
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

331
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:56,997
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

332
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:00,113
you think no end of yourself

333
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:04,259
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

334
00:25:04,394 --> 00:25:07,488
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

335
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:11,032
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

336
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:13,720
 "I did this, I did this, I went there.

337
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,865
I, I, I…"

338
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:23,746
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

339
00:25:25,014 --> 00:25:31,262
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

340
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:38,182
 funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

341
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:45,412
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
 somebody says that

342
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:49,909
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

343
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:54,074
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

344
00:25:54,518 --> 00:26:00,988
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

345
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,765
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

346
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:10,838
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

347
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:18,221
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

348
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:23,516
 and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

349
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:26,568
Not for others so much as for yourself,

350
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:30,957
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

351
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:37,274
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

352
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:43,745
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

353
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:49,253
You better be religious, so what?

354
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,531
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

355
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:56,144
 you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

356
00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:01,580
 all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

357
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:06,283
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

358
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:11,247
 you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

359
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:17,009
 you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

360
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:24,692
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

361
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,596
You just see yourself.

362
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,664
What happens, how you behave

363
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:37,958
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

364
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,100
It’s very sweet.

365
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,770
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

366
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:47,849
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

367
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:54,691
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

368
00:27:54,716 --> 00:28:00,045
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

369
00:28:00,156 --> 00:28:03,035
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

370
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:07,038
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

371
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:11,772
 like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

372
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:15,851
So if somebody tries to be funny,

373
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:19,542
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

374
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,826
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

375
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:27,256
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

376
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:29,456
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

377
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:32,660
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

378
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:36,824
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

379
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:40,719
But now it has become such a common practice,

380
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:44,497
and we know that he will just now come along

381
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:47,693
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

382
00:28:47,898 --> 00:28:53,293
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

383
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:58,378
which has been going through the different types of

384
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:05,623
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

385
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:11,744
 that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

386
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:18,319
 because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

387
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,904
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

388
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:29,557
 that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

389
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:34,627
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

390
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,635
when you have no authority,

391
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:41,591
 when you have nothing to do with that person.

392
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:46,105
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

393
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:50,362
has been made into the minds of human beings,

394
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:54,970
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

395
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:58,704
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

396
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:03,235
 maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

397
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,384
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

398
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:15,386
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

399
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:20,622
And what happens to you, that you become

400
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,289
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

401
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:30,851
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

402
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:36,406
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

403
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:38,740
Just it happens,

404
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:42,299
 though you are brought up the same way as others are,

405
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:46,386
 though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

406
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:53,791
 but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

407
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:00,087
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

408
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:05,097
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

409
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,485
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

410
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,433
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

411
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:16,171
how you are enjoying the company of others,
  it’s very remarkable;

412
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:21,789
 and that has come because your heart is full of joy

413
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:24,511
of the Spirit that shines within you.

414
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:27,943
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

415
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:31,498
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

416
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:34,686
There are some people who think no end of themself,

417
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:38,361
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

418
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,034
They are not enjoying.

419
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:43,191
They still think that they are something great,

420
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,301
so they must stay somewhere like that.

421
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,388
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

422
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:56,232
 when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

423
00:31:56,358 --> 00:32:00,708
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

424
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:04,236
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

425
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:07,720
with attached bath,  this, that;

426
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,667
 young people, it’s very surprising.

427
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:15,698
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

428
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:19,097
 or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

429
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:25,000
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

430
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:31,562
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

431
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,844
That is the One that gives you happiness.

432
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:41,319
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

433
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:48,066
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

434
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:51,056
If you want to know about the Christians,

435
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:54,123
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

436
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:58,154
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

437
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,458
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

438
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,935
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

439
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:10,282
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

440
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,466
So this whole attitude changes completely.

441
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:20,718
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

442
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:26,463
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

443
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:29,767
They become just one with each other.

444
00:33:29,952 --> 00:33:34,222
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

445
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:37,760
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

446
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,059
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

447
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:47,145
 that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

448
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:51,094
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

449
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:55,112
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

450
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:59,617
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

451
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:04,806
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

452
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:13,222
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

453
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:19,733
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

454
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:23,146
If the drop is outside the ocean,

455
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:27,081
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

456
00:34:27,392 --> 00:34:31,652
 he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

457
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:35,227
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

458
00:34:35,252 --> 00:34:39,396
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

459
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:45,370
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

460
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,789
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

461
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:52,641
 you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

462
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:55,212
 because you are the Spirit.

463
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,530
Now you should be on the watch

464
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:04,405
about yourself sometimes,
 and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

465
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:10,922
 how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

466
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:14,836
So many problems come in the West because

467
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:19,649
 they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

468
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:25,314
Because even an old man of eighty years

469
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:30,695
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

470
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:35,176
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

471
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:39,129
because he doesn’t accept his age,

472
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:44,086
 he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

473
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:51,348
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

474
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:54,072
This is more common in the West.

475
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:55,837
They always think like that.

476
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,541
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

477
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:05,032
They may be just on their way to the grave,

478
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:08,768
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

479
00:36:08,856 --> 00:36:11,055
This is the problem of the West.

480
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,894
Now how does it come?

481
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:17,958
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

482
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,673
and to be old is to be proud.

483
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:23,296
Now when I was five years,

484
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:28,339
 I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

485
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:31,939
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

486
00:36:31,964 --> 00:36:37,602
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

487
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:41,911
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

488
00:36:42,094 --> 00:36:45,938
 if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

489
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:48,349
then of course nobody can help.

490
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:53,795
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

491
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,262
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

492
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:01,574
 divorcing your wife and this, that.

493
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:04,872
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

494
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:08,833
they don’t have much respect for the women.

495
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:13,658
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

496
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:18,805
 supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

497
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:23,230
 and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

498
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:26,892
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

499
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:32,703
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

500
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:35,181
that a woman should be beaten up.

501
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:36,476
I mean, who is this poet?

502
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:39,676
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

503
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:45,622
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

504
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:50,983
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

505
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,713
 which is absolutely absurd.

506
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:58,226
This comes because you are not wise.

507
00:37:58,554 --> 00:38:03,581
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

508
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:07,722
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

509
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:11,830
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

510
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:16,066
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

511
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:20,348
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

512
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:25,015
 useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

513
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:34,229
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

514
00:38:34,698 --> 00:38:38,269
and you justify it, all that you justify

515
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:40,606
 and you say, "Now this is very good.

516
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:42,957
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

517
00:38:42,982 --> 00:38:47,948
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

518
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:51,517
"Whatever I am doing is good.

519
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,462
Whatever is my attitude is good.

520
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:59,397
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

521
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,436
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

522
00:39:03,517 --> 00:39:06,096
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

523
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:11,266
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

524
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:16,328
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

525
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:20,565
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

526
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:25,741
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

527
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:29,604
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

528
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:32,455
 or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

529
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,381
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

530
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:41,507
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

531
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:45,693
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

532
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:48,463
where you become the Spirit.

533
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:51,850
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

534
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:55,613
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

535
00:39:55,727 --> 00:40:00,313
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

536
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,997
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

537
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:11,544
 such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

538
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:15,992
 that you overcome the ego of others.

539
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,871
I must tell you a story.

540
00:40:17,896 --> 00:40:21,434
Once I went to see a saint.

541
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:22,836
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

542
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,100
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

543
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:28,491
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

544
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:30,015
So we had to climb a lot.

545
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,992
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

546
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:33,638
First you see his vibrations.”

547
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:36,783
So lots of vibrations were coming.

548
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:41,049
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

549
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:46,097
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

550
00:40:46,185 --> 00:40:52,268
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

551
00:40:52,379 --> 00:40:57,525
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

552
00:40:57,646 --> 00:41:01,161
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

553
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:04,719
 just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

554
00:41:05,204 --> 00:41:08,087
So I went into his cave and sat down.

555
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:14,134
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

556
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,184
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

557
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:22,600
Is it to overcome my ego?"

558
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:26,774
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

559
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:31,494
 I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

560
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,187
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

561
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:36,852
you bought a sari for Me.

562
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:41,455
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
 I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

563
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,937
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

564
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:51,162
And the whole thing melted away.

565
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:54,285
He became a very different person.

566
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:59,363
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

567
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:06,337
You say things by which you melt their ego.

568
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:15,951
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

569
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:23,153
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

570
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:25,804
 I should say, your Spirit.

571
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:32,943
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

572
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:38,266
 but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

573
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:47,524
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

574
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:54,842
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

575
00:42:54,984 --> 00:42:59,762
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

576
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:05,361
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

577
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:08,945
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

578
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:11,131
 so they have to be disciplined.”

579
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,318
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

580
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:17,965
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

581
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:20,681
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

582
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:23,535
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

583
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:26,860
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

584
00:43:26,885 --> 00:43:29,449
You don’t have to worry on that point."

585
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:32,461
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

586
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:35,966
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

587
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,541
The reason is, you are realized souls,

588
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:44,294
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

589
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:50,243
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

590
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:52,235
I don’t have to tell you.

591
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,823
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

592
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:59,734
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

593
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:02,679
 or anything, and how did they do it?

594
00:44:02,704 --> 00:44:07,340
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

595
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:09,654
 is the light of the Spirit.

596
00:44:09,718 --> 00:44:12,992
You become absolutely independent

597
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:17,000
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

598
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:19,549
because you have the light.

599
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:25,330
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

600
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:30,836
Supposing now there is light,

601
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:36,892
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

602
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,167
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

603
00:44:40,238 --> 00:44:44,881
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

604
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:49,966
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

605
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:54,839
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

606
00:44:56,945 --> 00:45:03,106
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

607
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:06,012
You are not slave of anything.

608
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,782
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

609
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:14,943
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

610
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:20,346
You don’t want to see whether
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

611
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:28,442
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things,
so you are gunatit.

612
00:45:28,749 --> 00:45:33,098
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

613
00:45:33,153 --> 00:45:37,804
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

614
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:43,838
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams
they are very strict.

615
00:45:44,068 --> 00:45:45,281
That should not be so.

616
00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:47,613
I have told them never to be strict.

617
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:51,992
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

618
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:54,295
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

619
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:58,229
After some time he himself will get up at four,

620
00:45:58,262 --> 00:46:01,124
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

621
00:46:01,243 --> 00:46:04,263
Children also you should not discipline too much.

622
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:09,257
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

623
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:10,754
 they are so beautiful.

624
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:13,934
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

625
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:17,561
Once you realize that those who are not realized

626
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:21,917
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

627
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:25,653
 your attitude towards them will change.

628
00:46:25,753 --> 00:46:30,342
You will just try to be extremely patient

629
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:34,794
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

630
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,991
because you will know that person is not realized.

631
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:42,776
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

632
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:48,568
 he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

633
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:51,330
So first let him feel the reality.

634
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:54,468
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

635
00:46:54,493 --> 00:46:59,673
Still he’ll go on making mistakes
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

636
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:02,012
So this is what you have achieved

637
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:07,037
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

638
00:47:07,704 --> 00:47:11,532
And you become a person of a temperament

639
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:17,468
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

640
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:23,160
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga
which has happened,

641
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:28,039
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

642
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:32,020
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

643
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:37,691
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

644
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:43,050
 but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,
as I told you yesterday,

645
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:45,302
 that these people went to Israel,

646
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:48,796
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

647
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:49,805
Who told them?

648
00:47:49,805 --> 00:47:52,181
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

649
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:55,747
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

650
00:47:55,772 --> 00:48:01,306
 and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

651
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:07,106
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

652
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:12,002
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

653
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,822
 they are very remarkably, very picturesque

654
00:48:32,847 --> 00:48:38,509
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

655
00:48:39,853 --> 00:48:42,745
In everything I see your love.

656
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:47,197
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

657
00:48:47,332 --> 00:48:52,800
I feel My children are so loving.

658
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:58,258
I have done nothing for you,
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

659
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,906
I still want to know, what have I done?

660
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:02,437
I have done nothing!

661
00:49:02,462 --> 00:49:05,507
But the way you want to express your love,

662
00:49:05,587 --> 00:49:09,994
 it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

663
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:14,679
that you got the light of your Spirit.

664
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:19,831
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

665
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:27,625
 but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

666
00:49:27,751 --> 00:49:30,646
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

667
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:33,401
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

668
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:34,506
It’s a fact.

669
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,469
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

670
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:42,052
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

671
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:47,238
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

672
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,079
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

673
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:56,437
and you don’t understand that
normally is not done like this anywhere;

674
00:49:56,532 --> 00:50:02,456
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
 their beautiful love.

675
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:08,050
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

676
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:13,757
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

677
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:19,334
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

678
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:21,577
How could you manage that?

679
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:29,143
It’s not easy to understand,
 it’s not for human beings to see that.

680
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:33,613
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

681
00:50:33,653 --> 00:50:37,992
and why are they living like this so happily?

682
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:43,893
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

683
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:47,147
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

684
00:50:47,164 --> 00:50:49,937
 it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

685
00:50:49,962 --> 00:50:52,943
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

686
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:56,101
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

687
00:50:56,149 --> 00:50:58,236
 you don’t care for anything.

688
00:50:58,261 --> 00:51:03,417
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

689
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:06,940
without any expectation, without any criticism,

690
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:11,985
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

691
00:51:12,017 --> 00:51:16,272
And even when you pull each other’s legs,
you know, I enjoy your jokes

692
00:51:16,297 --> 00:51:22,972
and understand that it’s such friendship,
such beautiful friendship.

693
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:29,593
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

694
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:33,773
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

695
00:51:33,877 --> 00:51:40,024
 oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

696
00:51:40,049 --> 00:51:43,679
 and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

697
00:51:43,704 --> 00:51:51,862
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is
what one has to achieve for others also.

698
00:51:52,095 --> 00:51:57,609
For that also, must remember that
 you have the light; others don’t have.

699
00:51:57,655 --> 00:52:03,089
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

700
00:52:03,114 --> 00:52:07,960
about their problem, and just listen to them.

701
00:52:08,046 --> 00:52:09,373
What is their problem?

702
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:14,265
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

703
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:19,424
 or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

704
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:24,270
 or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

705
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:26,806
All kinds of things they might tell you.

706
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:31,169
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

707
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:37,427
After that you will find gradually, you see,
 they’ll soothe down

708
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:42,874
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

709
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:49,534
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

710
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:52,213
You have those powers.

711
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:56,788
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

712
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:59,435
you can create happiness in that place.

713
00:52:59,486 --> 00:53:05,840
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

714
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:13,083
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

715
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:17,794
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

716
00:53:17,873 --> 00:53:21,109
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

717
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:25,009
they are not mad people,
 they are not after some sort of a craze -

718
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:29,442
just very, very balanced people."

719
00:53:29,858 --> 00:53:32,231
And this you don’t have to practice.

720
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:33,551
It is there.

721
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:36,901
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

722
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,600
You should not think that it is something

723
00:53:42,688 --> 00:53:47,962
that you have to achieve, or to become.

724
00:53:47,987 --> 00:53:50,710
You have it, within yourself you have it.

725
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:56,355
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

726
00:53:57,743 --> 00:54:03,066
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

727
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,835
It is not easy for others to understand you,

728
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:11,026
but it should be very easy to understand them;

729
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:13,961
because you were like that before,

730
00:54:13,986 --> 00:54:21,305
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

731
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,747
It’s very simple.

732
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:28,371
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

733
00:54:28,396 --> 00:54:30,834
And now today, see how many are there.

734
00:54:30,866 --> 00:54:34,275
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

735
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:36,347
I have no idea.

736
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,852
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

737
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:44,502
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

738
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:50,274
 you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

739
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:55,542
 of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

740
00:54:55,778 --> 00:55:01,149
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

741
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:07,864
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

742
00:55:08,324 --> 00:58:01,135
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
