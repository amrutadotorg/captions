WEBVTT

00:19.530 --> 00:25.650
Now we all have realized
by this time,

00:25.820 --> 00:36.150
within us lies the peace, the beauty,
the glory of our being.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.240
There's an ocean of all
that.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.820
We cannot seek it outside,

00:45.070 --> 00:48.780
we have to go within,

00:48.990 --> 00:52.900
what they call in
the meditative state,

00:53.110 --> 00:58.110
you seek it, you enjoy it.

00:58.450 --> 01:02.900
Like when you are thirsty,

01:03.110 --> 01:10.530
you go to a river or you
go to a ocean,

01:12.950 --> 01:17.360
and try to quench
your thirst.

01:17.650 --> 01:22.690
But even the ocean cannot
give you sweet water.

01:30.570 --> 01:33.650
So how can anything
that is spread outside

01:33.860 --> 01:38.900
give you that deep thing
that is within you?

01:39.150 --> 01:45.690
You are trying to find it outside,
where it does not lie.

01:46.150 --> 01:51.240
It is within us, absolutely
with in us.

01:54.530 --> 01:58.950
It is so simple because
it is your own

01:59.150 --> 02:02.070
it is within your reach,

02:02.400 --> 02:05.360
just there.

02:05.780 --> 02:10.900
What ever you have
been doing

02:11.950 --> 02:16.690
going out to find
the joy,

02:16.900 --> 02:21.200
the so called joy,
the so called happiness,

02:21.450 --> 02:32.240
the so called glory of worldly
powers and wordly possessions,

02:34.490 --> 02:38.950
you have to reverse it back
the whole thing.

02:40.030 --> 02:45.150
You have to project
within yourself.

02:45.690 --> 02:49.240
It was not wrong
that you went out,

02:49.490 --> 02:53.780
it was not correct
that you went out,

02:54.490 --> 02:59.900
shouldn't feel sorry for what
you have done so far.

03:00.530 --> 03:04.690
It was not the correct
way

03:04.900 --> 03:10.860
to get to the real joy
of life,

03:11.070 --> 03:16.110
the real glory of your
being.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.110
It has worked in so
many people

03:22.320 --> 03:28.070
that you have entered into
that subtler understanding.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.450
Some people are only at a mental
level, maybe, doesn't matter.

03:32.690 --> 03:38.490
Maybe, some are only at a physical
level that they can feel it,

03:38.690 --> 03:42.780
doesn't matter. But, you are
on the correct lines

03:42.990 --> 03:45.950
you are moving correctly.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.820
Try to meditate,

03:49.070 --> 03:53.950
meditate more so that you
reach your inner being.

03:54.150 --> 03:58.150
And this inner being, is the
vast ocean of bliss,

03:58.400 --> 04:02.280
which exists in
every one of us.

04:02.820 --> 04:07.900
Is that vast glorifying
flood of light

04:08.200 --> 04:14.450
that floods everybody's
inner beauty.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.570
So to approach it,

04:18.780 --> 04:26.610
you have to go within yourself
by denying things,

04:26.780 --> 04:31.150
which are against it,
against your movement.

04:31.400 --> 04:36.820
Sometimes the wind can be
very, very strong for you

04:37.110 --> 04:41.070
to misunderstand

04:41.700 --> 04:52.610
that the glory of God
is within.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.740
The turn back,

04:56.200 --> 05:05.030
every moment remember that
your movement has to be inward.

05:07.570 --> 05:11.150
When you move inward

05:11.400 --> 05:16.780
you forget the ideas of your
outer glories.

05:17.070 --> 05:21.780
A person, who is of a very
base nature,

05:21.990 --> 05:24.070
thinks that if he makes
a lot of money

05:24.320 --> 05:27.860
then he has achieved
joy, but he has not.

05:28.150 --> 05:30.690
He's the most unhappy person,
if you go and see him.

05:30.860 --> 05:34.900
He's worried about small,
small things of life.

05:35.110 --> 05:37.200
You must have heard that people
who are very rich

05:37.400 --> 05:39.110
are kleptomaniacs.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.570
They're worried, they're
very miserly,

05:41.740 --> 05:45.360
they're worried about a needle
here and there.

05:45.570 --> 05:49.280
A little thing missing they
get upset.

05:49.740 --> 05:53.450
They have so many habits that
they can't live without it.

05:53.690 --> 06:00.110
So riches have brought always
a curse on human beings.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.450
So those who seek only
the riches

06:05.650 --> 06:09.110
cannot enjoy them.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.900
Then there are some
better people,

06:12.150 --> 06:14.490
who think that by
ruling others,

06:14.690 --> 06:20.610
by getting power,
they can achieve

06:21.610 --> 06:25.530
very great position in life,

06:25.700 --> 06:28.150
they too assume, fail.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.150
You have seen what
happens to them,

06:30.360 --> 06:35.110
people don't even want
to talk about them.

06:36.570 --> 06:40.900
Now there are people
who get attached to someone

06:41.150 --> 06:45.400
to one person or to the family, to
their children, to their relations,

06:45.650 --> 06:47.820
very common in India.

06:48.030 --> 06:52.860
That's also not the way you
can get to God,

06:54.690 --> 06:56.740
that's also so limited,

06:56.950 --> 06:59.780
keeps you hanging
round them

06:59.990 --> 07:05.690
and wasting your energy
completely.

07:09.530 --> 07:16.740
But if you enter into
your being fully,

07:16.950 --> 07:21.320
then all these things have
such meaning;

07:21.530 --> 07:24.240
everything has
a meaning then.

07:24.490 --> 07:27.990
In a sense if you posses
anything,

07:28.200 --> 07:32.610
and if you're that kind of a person
who is supposed to keep possessing,

07:34.530 --> 07:38.900
he never possesses,
he's so detached.

07:39.110 --> 07:43.650
He's never possessive;
he's so detached about it.

07:43.820 --> 07:47.240
But, he can play around, because
he's so detached,

07:47.490 --> 07:50.570
he can create a drama
out of it.

07:50.780 --> 07:55.900
He can play with
the possessions,

07:56.110 --> 07:59.070
and teach lots of lessons
to people,

07:59.280 --> 08:06.570
HeÂ´s so detached, so generous,
he enjoys his generosity.

08:09.450 --> 08:12.990
The whole thing becomes
so different so dynamic.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.690
All the beauty that is created
by human beings,

08:16.860 --> 08:21.200
as possession is exposed
before you

08:22.860 --> 08:26.530
and you start enjoying
all those things

08:26.700 --> 08:29.950
without possessing them.

08:30.150 --> 08:35.200
You understand the myth
of possession.

08:36.690 --> 08:42.690
Same with your powers that people
have over other people.

08:43.110 --> 08:48.070
Those who try to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga,

08:48.280 --> 08:53.030
or want to have a kind
of a privilege over Sahaja Yoga

08:53.280 --> 08:57.360
can be subtle, this can
go very far.

08:57.610 --> 08:59.700
This subtlety goes to
this extent

08:59.950 --> 09:06.280
that I've seen people try to save
money on account of Sahaja Yoga.

09:06.530 --> 09:12.110
That's also the attention
is on money.

09:13.450 --> 09:16.740
To make money or
to save money,

09:16.990 --> 09:21.070
to make a business out of
Sahaja Yoga is all absurd,

09:21.280 --> 09:24.240
but if you say so I say,
"All right go ahead for a while,

09:24.490 --> 09:29.900
try. You'll find that Sahaja Yoga
is no business."

09:30.110 --> 09:35.110
Of course Sahaja Yogis
can work together,

09:35.360 --> 09:39.280
can do some business,
but Sahaja Yoga is no business.

09:39.530 --> 09:41.820
Is business of God,

09:42.030 --> 09:46.610
where you have to give
everything that you have,

09:46.780 --> 09:49.740
not ot be attached
to anything,

09:49.950 --> 09:51.900
not to be attached.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.360
There's no money
to be paid as such,

09:54.610 --> 09:58.150
but all your heart has
to be poured into it.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.280
If you cannot pour your
heart into it

10:01.530 --> 10:05.690
you cannot achieve.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.690
Same about power.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.690
Some people think

10:10.900 --> 10:13.240
that they can even overpower
Sahaja Yogis,

10:13.490 --> 10:17.820
impress them, control them,

10:18.070 --> 10:23.530
such people are thrown out of
Sahaja Yoga completely.

10:24.070 --> 10:29.200
You have to enjoy
the power of love,

10:29.450 --> 10:33.070
that people see you as
their protector,

10:33.320 --> 10:36.690
as their help, as their
support,

10:36.950 --> 10:42.360
as their friend,

10:42.860 --> 10:47.200
than somebody who is
a dominating personality.

10:50.450 --> 10:57.690
You have to be a father head and
not a demonic destructive force,

10:57.860 --> 11:00.070
which is always threatening
everyone.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.900
Such people will be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time.

11:04.150 --> 11:05.610
You are found out.

11:06.780 --> 11:09.780
I have  no sympathies
with such people, never,

11:09.990 --> 11:15.150
that will bring you down,
in no way.

11:16.690 --> 11:18.650
Keep your self aloof
with them,

11:18.860 --> 11:24.490
otherwise when they are thrown
away as tangents from Sahaja Yoga

11:24.690 --> 11:26.820
you might get out
with them,

11:27.110 --> 11:30.690
so be careful.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.650
Then those people who waste
all their time

11:35.950 --> 11:38.070
just thinking about
their family, this thing,

11:38.280 --> 11:40.740
or those who have never
thought of their family,

11:40.950 --> 11:42.820
also come to Sahaja Yoga.

11:43.030 --> 11:45.990
This is a very subtler
ground

11:46.200 --> 11:52.690
on which they can loose
their attention to their Spirit.

11:53.320 --> 11:58.690
They spoil their children, they spoil
their husbands, they spoil their wives.

11:58.900 --> 12:04.450
The whole attention
goes in a wrong way

12:04.650 --> 12:07.280
and it becomes a very
important issue with them,

12:07.530 --> 12:11.450
how the marriages are successful, how
the children are this thing, that thing.

12:11.650 --> 12:13.240
They don't leave it to God.

12:13.450 --> 12:16.110
They have to leave it to God.
We are all Saints,

12:16.320 --> 12:20.320
you have to leave every
thing to God.

12:21.070 --> 12:23.450
In the beginning in Sahaja Yoga
everybody says,

12:23.650 --> 12:27.400
"My husband is like that, my wife is
like that, my brother is like that,

12:27.610 --> 12:29.740
my children are like this.
Mother look after them,"

12:29.950 --> 12:32.030
all right in the beginning,
is all right.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.690
When you grow you
must get out of it.

12:35.900 --> 12:40.950
It's an individual journey towards
God when you meditate,

12:41.150 --> 12:44.900
and when you reach there
then you become collective.

12:45.150 --> 12:51.030
Before that, it's an absolute
individual journey within,

12:51.240 --> 12:53.900
absolutely individual journey.

12:54.110 --> 12:58.570
You should be able to
see this.

12:59.360 --> 13:04.860
You are in this journey
nobody is your relation

13:05.070 --> 13:08.860
nobody is your brother, nobody
is your friend,

13:09.110 --> 13:13.200
you're absolutely alone,

13:13.860 --> 13:16.610
absolutely alone.

13:16.780 --> 13:20.200
You have to move alone
within yourself.

13:20.450 --> 13:24.280
Don't hate anyone,
don't be responsible,

13:24.490 --> 13:28.320
but in meditative mood
you're alone.

13:28.570 --> 13:32.110
No one exists there,
you alone,

13:32.320 --> 13:35.860
and once you enter
into that ocean

13:36.070 --> 13:39.070
then the whole world
becomes your family.

13:39.320 --> 13:45.820
The whole world is your
own manifestation.

13:46.070 --> 13:50.320
All the children become
your children

13:50.570 --> 13:58.360
and you treat all people with
equal understanding.

14:03.400 --> 14:09.280
The whole expansion takes place when
you enter inside your Spirit

14:09.530 --> 14:15.490
and see starting through
the eyes of the Spirit.

14:16.690 --> 14:23.400
Such calm, such peace,
such bliss exists within you.

14:25.320 --> 14:30.110
You have to be ready
for that journey.

14:33.070 --> 14:42.150
That journey is alone in
your meditativeness

14:42.360 --> 14:44.400
and the more you find something
in your meditation

14:44.610 --> 14:48.320
the more you want to go
and distribute it to others.

14:48.570 --> 14:50.530
That has to,

14:50.780 --> 14:54.150
if that does not come into you
then it has not worked out.

14:54.360 --> 14:59.780
There is no purity, there's
some sort of a bias.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.950
In that individual pursuit,
what ever you find,

15:03.150 --> 15:06.150
you want to enjoy
it with others,

15:06.400 --> 15:07.820
want to give it to others.

15:08.030 --> 15:12.360
This is the sign of a person who
has been really meditating.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.650
The one who is meditative

15:15.690 --> 15:19.570
and has not been able to
distribute  what he has found,

15:19.740 --> 15:27.200
is cheating himself and
cheating others as well.

15:27.740 --> 15:32.570
Because that joy that you
receive in your meditation

15:32.740 --> 15:40.240
has to be distributed, has
to be given, has to be shown.

15:40.490 --> 15:43.740
It should flow in your
being

15:44.150 --> 15:50.400
as a light radiates from
every illumined lamp.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.690
We don't have to take
a vow

15:52.860 --> 15:55.240
to say this is an enlightened
light,

15:55.450 --> 15:56.610
in the same way,

15:56.780 --> 16:01.070
a saint should not be certified
that he is a saint.

16:01.280 --> 16:06.900
The depth you achieve within
yourself spreads all over,

16:07.150 --> 16:10.320
it is such an action
and reaction.

16:10.530 --> 16:14.780
The more deeper you become
the radiation is much more.

16:15.070 --> 16:18.820
A simple person, very
ordinary person,

16:19.030 --> 16:23.780
uneducated person,
can be like that.

16:23.990 --> 16:28.450
We have you know, one
gentleman called Vardic in Bombay

16:28.690 --> 16:34.530
he's an old man,
he's so deep, he radiates.

16:34.700 --> 16:39.570
People depend on him,
he radiates love,

16:39.740 --> 16:41.110
so meditative.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.650
You don't have to spend too
much time on meditation,

16:45.860 --> 16:50.900
but what ever you spend time,
what ever you gain

16:51.110 --> 16:54.450
is has to be visible
outside,

16:54.650 --> 17:02.070
how you radiate and how
you give it to others.

17:03.450 --> 17:06.900
That's the quality of the
saints you have to be.

17:07.110 --> 17:11.360
Unless and until you become deeper,
we cannot save other Sahaja Yogis

17:11.570 --> 17:15.150
and we cannot save those
who are not Sahaja Yogis.

17:15.360 --> 17:24.530
You have to rise higher and higher
to pull the whole curtain up.

17:26.110 --> 17:30.030
Those who try to rise
higher

17:30.240 --> 17:33.070
pull the whole thing
upward

17:33.280 --> 17:38.530
and they give a pull to everyone
who ascend with them.

17:38.690 --> 17:43.690
So just try to keep your
aim clear cut.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.650
Must understand what is
your aim in life as Sahaja Yogis.

17:46.820 --> 17:48.450
Now you are changed
people.

17:48.650 --> 17:52.070
You are no more people who have
to deal with possessions

17:52.280 --> 17:58.200
worry about them, about mundane
things, about your livelihoods.

17:58.450 --> 18:00.450
You are no more people
who have to worry too much

18:00.610 --> 18:04.900
about your health and things
or your personal lives.

18:05.110 --> 18:09.950
You are not to worry also
about your jobs so much,

18:10.150 --> 18:13.400
that's not important

18:15.400 --> 18:18.740
and last of all not to
worry about your family,

18:18.950 --> 18:21.690
children, husband, wife

18:21.900 --> 18:27.690
and find a pocket
for you to hide into it.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.990
Because the only thing where
you can really hide yourself

18:31.200 --> 18:36.400
is the love of God, where
you can really get

18:36.650 --> 18:40.900
the great restful, blissful,
feeling

18:41.110 --> 18:46.360
of his complete protection.

18:49.950 --> 18:53.900
Sydney has done very well before
and it's progressing better,

18:54.110 --> 18:56.950
but the pace is not
as it should be.

18:57.150 --> 18:59.450
So we have to think of new
ways and methods

18:59.650 --> 19:02.110
how we can spread this.

19:02.320 --> 19:06.240
But first you must assume
your positions as you are.

19:06.450 --> 19:09.450
You must assume that
you are all saints

19:09.650 --> 19:11.900
that you have to
do great work -

19:12.110 --> 19:16.820
not the ego part of it,
but the manifestation of it.

19:17.030 --> 19:21.740
Every one of you has
to decide for oneself.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.690
I'm sure it's going
to work out,

19:24.900 --> 19:30.200
and this time My visit is going
to help you a lot by understanding

19:30.400 --> 19:37.950
what is the best to spread
this light all.

19:38.240 --> 19:42.030
May God bless you.
