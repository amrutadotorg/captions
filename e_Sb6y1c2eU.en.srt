00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:33,999
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,333
27th September, 1992

3
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,375
Today is the first day of Navaratri.

4
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,750
And when I found that the rain was there

5
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,750
and all kinds of problems,

6
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,625
and Vishnumaya was suggesting some things,

7
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,750
I just consulted the calendar,

8
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:33,542
and you will be amazed to know that in the calendar

9
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:38,792
it is written that till five forty-five it’s not auspicious –

10
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,792
it’s inauspicious.

11
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,583
After five forty-five only

12
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,709
the right thing starts,

13
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:56,875
so just imagine, by calculation how it was correct

14
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:04,291
that five forty-five we had to have this puja,

15
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,750
after five forty-five.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,917
That is, the first day of Navaratri starts in Italy

17
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:14,917
or in Europe after five forty-five.

18
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,792
So it is something one must understand that

19
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,959
the Chaitanya is working out everything,

20
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,000
and it is giving all the suggestions;

21
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,125
because I had not at all seen the, what you call the

22
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,834
tithi (auspicious time),

23
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,792
but I just felt that, I said that we’ll have it

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,250
in the evening.

25
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,250
And when I said it, I said “Let’s see this,”

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,291
and there it was.

27
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,417
There’s so many things we have to see,

28
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:47,208
that whatever has been revealed to you, you can verify it.

29
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,999
For example, I had said long time back

30
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:56,458
that Mooladhara Chakra is made out of carbon,

31
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,417
carbon atom,

32
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:06,667
and if you see it from left to the right – right to the left,

33
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:13,250
left side you see nothing but a swastika.

34
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,999
So, now you see from left to the right,

35
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,375
then you see Omkara;

36
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,667
and once you see from down below upward,

37
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:30,166
you see the alpha and omega.

38
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,000
Now see, Christ has said that

39
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:38,208
“I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

40
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:42,083
So this swastika becomes Omkara,

41
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:47,250
also becomes Christ.

42
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,125
You can see it very clearly.

43
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:54,875
Now we have got a beautiful picture of that,

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,375
we have a tape, and I wanted to see you all that,

45
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,959
but I don’t know how we can manage here.

46
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,417
But I wish you all could see it, it’s so clear-cut.

47
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:10,166
So alpha and omega, also these mathematical things

48
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,458
have come to us from

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,250
inside, from the Divine.

50
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,583
This is not we have created.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,041
This was found out by some mathematicians

52
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,458
who were realized souls,

53
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:35,500
and they used this alpha and omega.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,834
It’s surprising how it shows so clearly that

55
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,208
swastika becoming Omkar,

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,208
and Omkar then becoming alpha and omega.

57
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:53,458
So everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible and

58
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,333
can be verified.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,500
Now you are worshipping today the Durga,

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,166
or all the nine forms of the Goddess.

61
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,959
She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,625
She fought all the people who were destroying

63
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,625
the seekers,

64
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,458
who were trying to make a mess of their lives.

65
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:34,792
And these tortured saints,

66
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,583
when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the

67
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:46,625
gods could do anything, and Sadashiva is never interfering

68
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:49,458
with what the Goddess is doing –

69
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,875
so they worshipped the Bhagawati,

70
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:57,542
and then the incarnation of Hers came nine times,

71
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,959
according to the need of the time.

72
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,291
So every time you find Her confronting people who are

73
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,917
extremely arrogant, self-opinionated,

74
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,792
thinking no end of themselves;

75
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,375
and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated

76
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:23,208
horrible rakshasas.

77
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,834
Now, in India when we cast the horoscope of a person,

78
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,000
we have three categories of people:

79
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,041
one are the devas, they’re called dev;

80
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,750
the second ones are the ones which are manavas,

81
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,041
means human beings;

82
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,208
and the third ones are rakshasas.

83
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:48,750
So I think I have got all of you from the dev categories,

84
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,875
because you could not have taken to Sahaja Yoga

85
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,000
that seriously unless and until you were there.

86
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,375
After all, why should you believe Me also that

87
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,333
when I say that there was the Durga, and there was

88
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:04,709
this thing, and She did this and did that?

89
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,125
It’s not that from one faith you have come out and now

90
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,125
you are jumping onto another faith; it’s not like that.

91
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:17,959
It is actually been proved – you can feel.

92
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,083
For example, when you are raising the Kundalini

93
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,792
on the center Heart,

94
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,166
you can feel

95
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,667
that on the center Heart if there is a catch,

96
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:34,333
you have to take name of the Jagadamba.

97
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,667
Unless and until you take Her name it won’t open out.

98
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,959
Also when I am clearing out your center Heart,

99
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:47,959
I have to also say, “Now I am in reality Jagadamba,”

100
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,875
and then the Jagadamba within you awakens.

101
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,542
So now you have verified it much more

102
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,959
than the scientists have done.

103
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,208
The scientists are going from outside,

104
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,291
and they are not conclusive at all.

105
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,166
Now if you have one problem, they will work it out;

106
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,542
another problem – they work out problems,

107
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,667
but they don’t know the basics,

108
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:16,125
what the problems are, and where lies the solution.

109
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:23,834
While you can see that once the Amba, this Kundalini

110
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:28,291
who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

111
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,375
of the Adi Shakti within you,

112
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:36,667
when She rises through these different chakras,

113
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,291
She gives them power because She’s the Power,

114
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,291
She’s the Shakti.

115
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,417
She is the desire power of Sadashiva.

116
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:52,667
She is the complete power of Sadashiva.

117
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,917
And so She gives the power totally to every chakra,

118
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,583
by which all these chakras are enlightened

119
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,250
and all the deities are awakened.

120
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,375
Supposing we have no power of life,

121
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:09,999
we’ll be like dead people.

122
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:14,166
So these centers when they receive this power,

123
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,291
this Shakti, then they are awakened.

124
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:20,500
Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself.

125
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,625
It’s all tangible,

126
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,083
you can verify it.

127
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:32,792
I have told you that She resides on the Heart center.

128
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,709
Now see how Heart center is placed –

129
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,709
also very interesting to see.

130
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:44,166
While She is Jagadamba; but the Amba, means the pure

131
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,959
form of power, resides in the triangular bone,

132
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,291
like Kundalini.

133
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,750
But Her form which is Jagadamba,

134
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:01,542
where She is the Mother of the Universe,

135
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:05,917
She resides on the Heart center.

136
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:10,542
Now this Heart center is very important.

137
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:15,792
When – I have already told you this, that when a child

138
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:20,625
is about, till the twelve years of age,

139
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:26,500
this center produces the ganas.

140
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:32,875
Ganas are the workers on the left-hand side.

141
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,417
They are like, we can say St. Michael is their leader,

142
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:47,667
but their king is Ganapati, Ganesha.

143
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:54,500
So first She has done is the ghatasthapana.

144
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,834
“Ghatasthapana” means – you have done here now,

145
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,333
this is the ghatasthapana (pot with coconut)

146
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,375
This is the kumbha.

147
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,333
Now this kumbha She has established first:

148
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,208
that is the triangular bone.

149
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:12,333
Now this is Her first work, that to establish this,

150
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
your Mooladhara.

151
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,250
So She established within you is innocence.

152
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,959
She established innocence within you to begin with.

153
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,375
So She has put this ghata in which She is staying

154
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,417
as Kundalini now.

155
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:35,875
So the first is that to establish the Kundalini

156
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,999
in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shri Ganesha.

157
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,542
This is the first work, by which whatever She is going

158
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,750
to create now –

159
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,875
all the Universes, the Earth, everything –

160
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:00,083
whatever She is going to create has to be filled with

161
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,000
innocence.

162
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,792
Now if you see the stones,

163
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,583
they’re innocent.

164
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,166
If you hit the stone you’ll get the hit,

165
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,250
otherwise it doesn’t come up and hit you.

166
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,709
They’re innocent.

167
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:26,417
If you see the rivers, they’re innocent.

168
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:32,750
Everything that has been created as matter is innocent.

169
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:37,750
It is not cunning, it is not manipulating,

170
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,000
it is not aggressive – nothing of the kind.

171
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,542
They’re innocent,

172
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:47,458
means they’re under the complete order of God Almighty.

173
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,709
They do not have their own free will to do what they like.

174
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:58,875
Whatever is done is with the absolutely under complete

175
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,250
command of God Almighty,

176
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,500
and so they are, we can say they’re innocent,

177
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,083
because they have no free will to do what they like.

178
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,291
So then if you see the animals also,

179
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:22,333
they also are innocent, except for very few.

180
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,917
Most of them are innocent, innocent in the sense that

181
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,208
they are called as “pashu”– means they are completely

182
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,917
under the control, pasha, of God Almighty.

183
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,458
A tiger will behave like a tiger,

184
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,583
and a snake will behave like a snake.

185
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,709
But in human beings somebody will behave like a tiger,

186
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:49,041
tomorrow like a snake and third day like a worm.

187
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,417
There’s no steadiness.

188
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:54,750
For this you cannot say that this gentleman is today tiger,

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,166
so tomorrow he will not be a snake.

190
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:03,125
They have no free will to change their individuality.

191
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,959
They are left alone.

192
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,709
So that is not the job of the Shakti to bother.

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,375
That’s already been created, they are there,

194
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,583
and they are existing.

195
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,291
They have a purpose, that’s why they are there;

196
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:23,709
and the purpose is only one, is to support human beings,

197
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,999
because you are at the epitome of evolution.

198
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:32,750
So She has created all these things just for you

199
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:39,458
to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization;

200
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,667
to have meaning for your life,

201
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:43,792
to get connected to this all-pervading Power,

202
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,250
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

203
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,250
All is Her work.

204
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:53,834
So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time

205
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,959
She is supposed to give Realization to all of you.

206
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,125
But at the tenth time, all these three powers are

207
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,583
joined together – that’s why it’s called Trigunatmika.

208
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,542
That’s why Buddha has said “Matreya”–

209
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:12,709
means three Mothers put together.

210
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,500
So this Power when it starts acting, it has the complete

211
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:25,999
control over all your three channels and seven centers –

212
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,417
complete control,

213
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:34,542
as if without the permission or without the taking

214
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:40,999
the name of this Power, you cannot achieve anything.

215
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,417
Is a fact,

216
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:47,667
and that is where human beings fail,

217
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,834
because they have a free will,

218
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,458
and they don’t know why to obey anyone or why to listen

219
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:57,125
to anyone, and why to accept anyone.

220
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,959
That’s why, though you have to be given Self-realization,

221
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,375
the task is very difficult;

222
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,999
because you are not used to

223
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,999
a way where you don’t have to use your free will.

224
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,959
Specially in the Western countries,

225
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:21,500
people have choices even for their cereals.

226
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,917
I was told that in America there are 126 types of cereals.

227
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,458
This kind of nonsense if you are doing,

228
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:36,667
your ego definitely bloats out, and you think

229
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:42,458
that “We have a right to decide for ourself.”

230
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,750
And you cannot accept somebody who can tell you that

231
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,041
this is not right, and this is not right.

232
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:57,542
So the same Power has now been awakened in

233
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,959
the Paramachaitanya.

234
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:03,417
Now, this awakening into the Paramachaitanya is doing

235
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:07,792
marvellous work, which you can see clearly.

236
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,875
Firstly, you have seen My photographs.

237
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,458
You see My photographs, you are stunned,

238
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,542
you are surprised. I mean,

239
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,834
I Myself don’t know what is this Paramachaitanya

240
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,792
is busy with.

241
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:27,000
It is so activated that all the time it is working out

242
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:33,375
to convince you people about the truth.

243
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:37,250
If it was so active at the time of Christ,

244
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,542
would have been much better.

245
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:42,291
But it had to be this way, because human beings are

246
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:46,583
the most difficult things to manage.

247
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:50,458
They have been given freedom; that too,

248
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:51,999
you’d be amazed,

249
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,125
that the freedom was given to Adam and Eve,

250
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,709
but how it was achieved,

251
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,333
we should understand this.

252
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,041
In the Gnostics Bible it has come out what I’ve been

253
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:08,875
saying, that Adam and Eve, both of them

254
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:15,500
were like pashus, under the complete control of God –

255
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,208
no free will.

256
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:23,999
They would have lived in the nude in the garden of Eden,

257
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:29,083
would not have even thought of knowing anything

258
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,333
more than that, but to eat, live like animals.

259
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,083
They were just like animals.

260
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:41,625
Then it is the Shakti itself took the form of a snake,

261
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,250
and went and told them that

262
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,625
“You must have the fruit of Knowledge.”

263
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,291
She wanted to evolve.

264
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,709
That was not the idea of God Almighty,

265
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,709
because it’s quite a headache, you know,

266
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,500
to do such a thing.

267
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,542
He thought, “What is the need to have

268
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,291
such headaches around Me?”

269
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,875
But Shakti knew Her own style.

270
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:11,125
She knew that She is capable of lots of miracles,

271
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:15,333
and She can make these human beings understand

272
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,625
the Knowledge, and She can really make them

273
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,834
knowledgeable.

274
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,375
So She said, “You must eat this fruit,

275
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:31,875
and you must try to know the Knowledge.”

276
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:39,208
So a new type of human race started,

277
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,667
which wanted to know what is the Knowledge.

278
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,000
You have seen that we had all kinds

279
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,917
of primitive people before.

280
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,333
Then they started evolving, evolving.

281
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:58,333
Now, I have to say that

282
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,875
the first creation which took place before that,

283
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:10,083
there were other higher creations

284
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:19,834
which were planned by Adi Shakti

285
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:24,083
to plan out the whole thing.

286
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:27,083
So She created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha,

287
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:33,750
and She created their lokas, their atmospheres or you can

288
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,667
say their areas.

289
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,333
In that all the planning was done,

290
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:44,125
how we can achieve this to make these animals realized

291
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,333
souls, from animal to human beings,

292
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:51,000
and from human beings to realized souls.

293
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,000
It was a very big problem.

294
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,999
That’s how they created, you see – as you know that

295
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,875
Vishnu had His own loka,

296
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,625
Mahesha had His own loka,

297
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,500
and Brahmadeva had His own loka.

298
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,792
And they decided among themselves how best we can do it.

299
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,291
Because these three channels were created in human

300
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,458
beings later on.

301
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:18,709
Out of the three channels came out these three Shaktis:

302
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,959
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

303
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,375
They produced two children,

304
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,834
one shakti and one the brother,

305
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,333
and then intermarriage and all that took place,

306
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,625
in a way – marriage not in the human way,

307
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,959
not in the human way we should say, but they were,

308
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:42,667
the energy was given to the potential man.

309
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,333
So the woman, who was the energy representing,

310
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,208
was given to a man.

311
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,000
All these things happened,

312
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:59,834
and they chose to work it out in human beings.

313
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,208
It happened like this, that the first working

314
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,917
somehow or other was very effective in India.

315
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,083
Or maybe they chose India because Indian climate

316
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,583
is so good.

317
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,834
I mean, you know definitely there are six seasons.

318
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,208
It’s not like this anytime,

319
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:21,417
like this irrational rain comes in, like London

320
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:22,999
you have to play football also with

321
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,583
an umbrella on your head!

322
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,959
So there are exactly six seasons in India,

323
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,333
and they are so well balanced.

324
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:39,959
That’s why this Paramachaitanya is also called as

325
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,583
“Ritambhara pragya” in India – not here,

326
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,709
we cannot say.

327
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,625
“Ritambhara pragya” means the one

328
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,125
which is the Knowledge, pragya,

329
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,750
means the one enlightened Knowledge,

330
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,500
of the one which makes seasons.

331
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:04,667
Because here ritambhara pragya is in a doldrum.

332
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,083
It’s not at all understanding,

333
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:09,834
because of the human beings as they are.

334
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,166
They are so much scatterbrain, I should say,

335
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,917
that even the nature has become scatterbrain here,

336
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,417
and cannot understand how to deal with such human

337
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,750
beings – is a fact.

338
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,875
But in India it is the six seasons are there,

339
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,999
and these six seasons are absolutely known.

340
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,458
One has not studied the astrology of India,

341
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,125
but they have their own astrology –

342
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,125
of course, I don’t believe in it.

343
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:46,083
But the, at the level of a human level

344
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,667
you can see how they depict

345
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,000
and how they can exactly say when it will rain,

346
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:56,250
when it will not rain; what will happen, that will happen.

347
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,667
Even about the stars, that such a star will be coming.

348
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,291
Now this has been done in thousands of years back.

349
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,834
They will exactly say

350
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:05,999
what time which star will be coming nearer,

351
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,999
what star are today governing,

352
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,333
tomorrow what will be the star there.

353
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:15,166
In those olden days they had studied all these things.

354
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,542
When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation

355
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,667
at that time in these Western countries,

356
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,208
whether there were human beings or not I don’t know;

357
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:31,625
but historically I think it was not such a developed place.

358
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:38,375
So then all this arrangement was made,

359
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:43,208
and human beings were made to understand

360
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:47,083
that there is God.

361
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:52,667
The saints were respected – I’m telling you in India –

362
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,834
real saints were respected,

363
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:59,792
and they made different observations.

364
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,792
Now when I read say, Adi Shankaracharya,

365
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:07,917
I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me.

366
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:11,125
He knows how My knee looks like,

367
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:14,709
he knows how many lines I have on My back,

368
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:18,041
how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man

369
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,542
knows everything about Me.

370
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:23,792
That means through his meditative power he could

371
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,792
envisage Me – he never saw Me.

372
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,583
The description and everything is so clear-cut.

373
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,542
Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess,

374
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:39,583
thousand names of the Goddess are so precise.

375
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:43,250
I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that.

376
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,750
Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me

377
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,583
is there, is a fact.

378
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,375
And it is the Knowledge of these people

379
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:57,083
is most remarkable: how did they know that

380
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,999
a Goddess is like that?

381
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,333
Certain of My things which I also don’t know,

382
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:08,041
but they are there, and they have described.

383
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:10,166
It’s very surprising.

384
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,166
So their meditative power in India was great.

385
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:18,500
The reason was, our seasons were disciplined,

386
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,291
people are disciplined.

387
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,792
In India most of the people get up early in the morning,

388
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,625
do their pujas, everything, take their baths,

389
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:31,542
and they go for work, come home, be with the family, have

390
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:36,250
their food, and then sing some songs and bhajans,

391
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:40,208
and then sleep off – normally.

392
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,583
Very disciplined.

393
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,999
They don’t go on holidays,

394
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,917
they don’t get into drinking and things like that.

395
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,542
Normally in the family, no question, if somebody drinks

396
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,959
he’s thrown out of the house.

397
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,333
He’s condemned as a leper.

398
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:01,625
He’s called as a daruda, means he is a drunkard.

399
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:05,500
And even nowadays some people are drinking,

400
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:10,667
but they too, they hide their drinking.

401
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,500
Nobody drinks in the presence of others.

402
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,083
I mean, I don’t know, their influence might increase

403
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,667
and people will start openly drinking,

404
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,999
but normally they don’t.

405
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:27,083
So because of these six seasons being absolutely in

406
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:33,375
discipline, we knew what to do when, and how to do it.

407
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:38,458
Now, people could live in the jungles.

408
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,458
Like in England, if you have to go out it takes fifteen,

409
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:44,250
twenty minutes: you have to wear your shoes, socks,

410
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,999
your coat, your under- this thing, that thing;

411
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,041
otherwise you can’t get out.

412
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,417
And you start from one place; reaching another place

413
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,458
you’ll find it is raining heavily, you have nothing,

414
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,875
you get drenched.

415
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,333
But this is not so in India.

416
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:05,458
It’s so balanced that when you come, all of you come

417
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,834
in winter-time, you have seen it.

418
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:11,083
It doesn’t rain suddenly, it doesn’t happen like that

419
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,000
at a wrong time.

420
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,125
You can stay outside as long as you want.

421
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,291
So these people could live in the jungles,

422
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:24,041
in the sense we didn’t have so much idea of comfort at all.

423
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:27,417
In a simple little hut they could live:

424
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,458
a little protection from the sun,

425
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,792
and protection from the rain for rainy season,

426
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,375
that’s all.

427
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:40,083
And they had very little needs of life.

428
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,333
And we didn’t use plastics – I mean,

429
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,792
there were no plastics that time, or even now

430
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,458
we don’t use plastics.

431
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:52,000
And we used to have few thalis and things.

432
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,500
In a small family also they’ll have just thalis,

433
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:00,166
which were just permanently with the family.

434
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,959
Now I find that such a difference there is.

435
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:07,125
You see, in simple living what happens,

436
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:12,917
that you do not take out

437
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,458
all the wealth from the Mother Earth.

438
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:17,959
There’s no ecological problem there.

439
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:22,375
But by having as you are saying so many glasses for this,

440
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,417
so many glasses for that, all this kind of thing that you

441
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:31,750
produce has no aesthetic value, and has no durability.

442
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,999
So then you have mountains and mountains of these huge

443
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,542
big plastics which cannot be burnt, which cannot be

444
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:43,166
thrown away, if you throw away in the sea it floats,

445
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,208
and such problems are there.

446
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:50,458
So this Shakti that was working in those days

447
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:56,041
was in them to make them seekers;

448
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,458
because they didn’t have to do anything else, you know.

449
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,709
It’s all right, you have food to eat,

450
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,250
you have place to sleep,

451
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,875
finished – not much to be done,

452
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,500
living so happily.

453
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,625
With all these

454
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:18,583
comforts in the way that so little a demand on your time,

455
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,834
they had time, lot of time.

456
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:26,125
And with that time, what did they do?

457
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,917
They didn’t go, say, for that, for a swimming or

458
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,583
ballroom dancing, or nothing of the kind.

459
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,959
With that time they meditated.

460
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,999
And when that time meditation started,

461
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:46,750
then they started realizing what is the divine Power,

462
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:50,208
what is Divinity, what is God.

463
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,542
For example I’ll tell you, here people discuss even

464
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,417
the private life of Christ, and say all kinds of things;

465
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:00,792
I mean, it’s impossible in India, nobody does that.

466
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,125
It never comes to their head that

467
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,834
how Krishna had sixteen thousand wives –

468
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,500
must be some reason, He is God after all. God is God,

469
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,375
youare a human being – how can you know about God,

470
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,458
because you have come through Him?

471
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,834
They don’t discuss such nonsensical things,

472
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:18,875
must be that.

473
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,542
And now when I told them these are His powers,

474
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:23,542
sixteen thousand, they said, “Yes.”

475
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,625
Then, the five wives were the five elements – “Yes.”

476
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,166
They are God.

477
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:30,999
Nobody discusses these things.

478
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:33,667
God is – how can you understand God?

479
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,333
Can you understand Me? You can’t.

480
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,917
Try – you can’t understand Me.

481
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,999
Very difficult.

482
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,667
So you can’t understand,

483
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,500
you can’t understand God.

484
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,458
Please understand one thing,

485
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,917
that for to understand God is an impossibility.

486
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,959
But you can be in connection with God,

487
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,041
you can be in the company of God,

488
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:57,999
you can be blessed by God,

489
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,375
you can be looked after by God,

490
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,166
you can know lots of things about God;

491
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:07,542
but you cannot understand.

492
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:12,291
This is another thing one has to know,

493
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,333
that you cannot understand why God does these things,

494
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:19,208
why He does this, why He does that.

495
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:22,250
You cannot understand, you cannot explain it.

496
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,333
I mean, somebody can even say here,

497
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,333
“Why did He make swastika?”

498
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,250
Then, “Why did He make Omkara?”

499
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,959
I mean here the people are so arrogant that they can even

500
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,375
ask God, “Why did You exist?”

501
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,250
They can go to that limit, you know,

502
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:41,166
there’s nothing surprising.

503
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,166
So this arrogance, this ego has blinded us from God.

504
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
We think no end of ourselves,

505
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,458
we are very self-opinionated,

506
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,458
and we do not know much about it.

507
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,792
So this Power, this Shakti is the one which has given you

508
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,917
Self-realization, will also give you God-realization;

509
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,959
but still you will not understand God.

510
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,917
You have to go above God to understand Him.

511
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,959
How will you understand?

512
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,667
Supposing there’s something below you,

513
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,000
you can understand;

514
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,917
but something above you, how will you understand?

515
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,917
Supposing somebody is down below in Cabella

516
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,917
and wants to understand about My house,

517
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,333
will he understand?

518
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:29,041
He has to go above the Cabella to see My house.

519
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,166
So the Source from which we have come,

520
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,959
we cannot understand that.

521
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,750
We cannot judge, we cannot say why;

522
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:43,999
that is God’s wish, God’s desire, whatever He does.

523
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,083
So what we have to say: whatever His wish,

524
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,291
we’ll be happy with that.

525
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,917
And the power that is within you is Amba,

526
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,875
is the desire power of God itself.

527
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,583
So whatever your wish is, means that

528
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:03,208
His wish is that you should enter into His Kingdom.

529
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,375
Now you enter into the Kingdom of God.

530
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,166
Then the Shakti makes you

531
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:14,583
sit on different beautiful positions,

532
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:18,417
and some are sitting in the Heart of God,

533
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,999
some are sitting in the Sahasrara of God,

534
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,083
in the Kingdom of God.

535
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,417
Now you should assume your power.

536
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:31,417
On Navaratri now, you should understand that it has now

537
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:36,709
crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position,

538
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,250
where you must assume.

539
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,542
I have told you many a times, now believe that

540
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,792
you are Sahaja yogis.

541
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,959
Believe that you are,

542
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,917
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

543
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,834
You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that,

544
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,875
why She does that, why He does that.

545
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,999
You cannot say that – that’s different.

546
00:34:57,291 --> 00:35:01,625
But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly,

547
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:05,208
it is not like a politician fighting, no;

548
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,875
it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

549
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:13,667
blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished,

550
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:17,542
and made knowledgeable.

551
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:21,125
But still this arrogance has to go down,

552
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:25,125
that we can understand why it happens.

553
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:29,500
That humility is very important for us;

554
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:33,166
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

555
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,291
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

556
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,959
now this power has to go higher and higher.

557
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:44,999
For that, first you should be humble.

558
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,875
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

559
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:52,750
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

560
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,709
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

561
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,917
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

562
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,458
You are too great.

563
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:08,834
But let us know ourselves.”

564
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,875
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

565
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,625
like His own image.

566
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,166
That means He has given you all the powers.

567
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,834
He has made you.

568
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:24,667
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

569
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,792
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

570
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:31,333
He has made you in His own image.

571
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:37,834
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

572
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,375
These powers are with you.

573
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,208
But the first thing you have to have,

574
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,417
the discipline within yourself,

575
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,333
that is missing.

576
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,333
People cannot discipline themselves – means

577
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,458
if they cannot control themselves,

578
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:54,125
how can they control anyone?

579
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:59,709
No discipline means you cannot control yourself.

580
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,875
So the discipline should be that first

581
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,999
you must see that you control yourself,

582
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:09,542
because now you are in the Kingdom of God.

583
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:13,083
Have you seen a film called “Mr. Bean”

584
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,792
where they show a stupid man, you see?

585
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:21,875
So what happens that when you are now come to the court

586
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,875
of the Goddess,

587
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,250
when you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

588
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:30,083
you are made to sit on your throne in a dignified way.

589
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,333
But you start behaving like Mr. Bean, you see.

590
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:37,166
You don’t know how to sit on your seat,

591
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,750
you want to sit on the sides,

592
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,709
you want to sit on the wall or do all kinds of things.

593
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,625
There’s no discipline.

594
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,750
You have to have the discipline.

595
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,542
Where are you sitting?

596
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,083
You are sitting in the Kingdom of God.

597
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,999
So you should have that dignity,

598
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,999
you should have that affection,

599
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,999
you should have that compassion,

600
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:02,667
you must have that love, and the dedication.

601
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:05,542
But if it is not there, then this power is useless,

602
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:09,083
because you are the vehicle of that power.

603
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:13,250
Supposing I have to take water, I have to have glass

604
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,166
which is emptied inside.

605
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,959
If it is already full with ego,

606
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,500
what can you put inside that?

607
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,417
Or if it is a stone, you can’t drink water out of that,

608
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:31,500
you’ll have to dig in the space for putting the water.

609
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:34,208
So if you are already filled with your own ideas,

610
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:40,999
with your own conveniences, with your own progress

611
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,917
or whatever it is, only that,

612
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:48,250
then you cannot rise very high.

613
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,917
You have to surrender fully there, to say that

614
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:55,166
“Mother, whatever is Your desire,

615
00:38:55,709 --> 00:39:01,542
that we do not want to have any our individual desire.”

616
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,083
Then the desire of God will work.

617
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,083
You want Kundalini to work for you which is the desire

618
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,750
of God,

619
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,625
not your desire, which is independent of your desire,

620
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:18,208
but is the one which will fulfill your

621
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,542
complete so-called desires,

622
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,208
without even your Knowledge.

623
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:26,542
Miracles after miracles will happen, so many miracles

624
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,583
that now we do not know how to compile the book

625
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,125
even on miracles.

626
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,375
But these miracles are coming to you because you are

627
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,291
realized souls.

628
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,166
Your attention should be all right, you must see and

629
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:43,083
introspect yourself. “I am sitting in the Kingdom of God,

630
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,166
now what is my situation?

631
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,667
Is it worth it, am I worth it, am I behaving in the same

632
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:54,166
manner, or still I don’t believe?”

633
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,750
If you don’t believe, how can you rise?

634
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,458
“Believe” means that you have seen something,

635
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,709
you have known something which is tangible,

636
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,208
you have got the experience of it.

637
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:08,959
Still you are not surrendered.

638
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,500
If you surrender to the will of God,

639
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:14,250
then everything is taken charge.

640
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,166
It will never let you down, no question;

641
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,166
and everything, all things which look like

642
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:23,875
mountains of difficulties and obstructions

643
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,750
you will surpass, just like an aeroplane goes over it.

644
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:32,083
You won’t have any problem whatsoever.

645
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,291
So one thing today, I am very happy that this puja is done

646
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:42,000
by the people from a country which is discipline

647
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:47,375
is very important – that is, Switzerland.

648
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:54,125
But their discipline is for bad things, not for good.

649
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,709
For example, they have a military:

650
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,625
who is going to go to that far-fetched place, you see,

651
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:05,959
to attack?

652
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,667
No one.

653
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,417
Why do they have military?

654
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,625
And compulsory military, do you know that?

655
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:13,625
Because they have looted other people’s money and

656
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:16,917
kept them there, like thugs.

657
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,000
So all that money is in their banks, and they are worried

658
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,375
that any time, you see, any person can come up and

659
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:31,583
demand the money, and may start using the power

660
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,375
of destruction on us.

661
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,500
So, because they are doing wrong, that’s why they

662
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:40,542
have a military – out of fear, just out of fear.

663
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,834
There is no need to have any military there.

664
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,208
But everybody has to go to military

665
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,875
and join the military,

666
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:54,917
because they are thieves of the worst type.

667
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:59,458
Then secondly, they have also very much slavery

668
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,709
of the watch, which human beings have made,

669
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,250
God has not made.

670
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:07,041
So the watch is important, because they are

671
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,041
making watches.

672
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:13,375
If they are making watches and if they do not slave

673
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:18,583
under the watches, who will buy their watches?

674
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:21,083
They will say, “What’s the use of you all have watches,

675
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:22,834
and the way you are?”

676
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,875
So they are very disciplined.

677
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:28,375
Not only, they also are, I mean extremely

678
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,750
as they’ve shown yesterday, they’re really

679
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:35,999
too much of cleanliness in them.

680
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,125
Some of the girls who were married – I must say

681
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,709
I’m sorry to say this, but it is a fact –

682
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,041
were married from Switzerland,

683
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,709
and the reports have come that

684
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,709
“Mother, they must have been maid-servants

685
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,625
or bar-maids.”

686
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,417
So I said, “Why?”

687
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,250
“If something falls down somewhere, immediately

688
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,291
they’ll pick it up and keep there.

689
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,208
If something even – it’s just like, like in the guests,

690
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,625
you see the guests are sitting

691
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,999
and they have no time to talk.

692
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,875
There’s no question of talking to each other,

693
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,083
there’s nothing;

694
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,125
all the time they are worried about

695
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,792
this thing, this is getting dirty,

696
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:13,083
that is getting dirty, like maid-servants.”

697
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,375
Can you imagine?

698
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,792
This has also come from the same horrible disciplining

699
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,166
that they have.

700
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:24,041
This disciplining is not divine disciplining.

701
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,166
Nature is not like that.

702
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,750
If you see the nature, see how the nature is beautiful,

703
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:32,750
the – you’ll never find any smell there.

704
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,041
Ha, but if human beings go and live there,

705
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:39,291
then all smells start. But there is no smell.

706
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,917
Nature looks after itself, it cleanses itself, it does everything.

707
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:46,333
So for everything there’s a time, it must be done with

708
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:47,999
a little leisure.

709
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,083
I mean, once if you have to clean the house,

710
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,709
so clean the house.

711
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:53,208
But all the time if your attention is cleaning this,

712
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,166
cleaning this, make this clean, put this right –

713
00:43:56,625 --> 00:44:02,625
you are good for nothing, you are like a Hoover machine!

714
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,500
And who can love such a woman

715
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:11,750
who’s just a Hoover machine all the time?

716
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:22,125
But again as the, you know the Devi has the,

717
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:25,333
all the extremes, so this is one extreme.

718
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:30,250
And the another extreme is that absolutely lousiest people,

719
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,709
that in England –

720
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,959
absolutely lousy, very lousy.

721
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,834
They can live with all kinds of lousiness,

722
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,250
and that is going too far.

723
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:47,250
So this is in between one has to be.

724
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:51,999
Cleanliness is for us, we are not for cleanliness.

725
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:55,917
You are not paid for that, you are not maid-servants.

726
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,166
So cleanliness has to be there.

727
00:44:58,583 --> 00:44:59,458
We like it so we’ll make it clean,

728
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:01,000
but it should not be that

729
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:04,250
everybody should be panicked about it;

730
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,834
to be in a situation that you have no time to talk to

731
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,417
anyone, to be nice to anyone, also no time even

732
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,041
to meditate.

733
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:17,250
Even meditating they will be seeing round

734
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,750
if something is falling here, “Oh my God!”

735
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,999
and they will go and pick up.

736
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,959
I wouldn’t be surprised that even in the church they

737
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,083
start doing that!

738
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:31,542
There’s no discipline of meditation,

739
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:35,999
discipline of meditation, of divine work,

740
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:41,959
discipline of following the will of God –

741
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,417
that’s not there.

742
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:47,291
Unless and that discipline comes many,

743
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:51,417
what you are doing is something so mundane and stupid,

744
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:57,999
useless wastage of your life, have no dignity for yourself.

745
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:02,917
So now as Sahaja yogis we have to have that discipline

746
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,834
of meditation.

747
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:11,250
Then the Power, this Amba, She knows you so well:

748
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,834
She knows your past,

749
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,875
and She knows what sort of a person you are.

750
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:19,125
Once you start introspecting

751
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,375
and seeing it within yourself,

752
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,500
“what is wrong with me?”

753
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:28,375
and to reach that state of complete equilibrium,

754
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:30,208
“what have I to do?” –

755
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:34,542
is to first of all, you have to meditate.

756
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:39,542
There is no way out, I must tell you, there is no way.

757
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,917
Somebody said, “Mother, I have given up eating this,

758
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:45,083
I have given up eating that” – nothing.

759
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:49,500
“Mother, I do this and I stand on my head” – nothing.

760
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:53,000
You must meditate, and the meditation

761
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,583
should be little bit in the morning

762
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,750
and little bit in the evening.

763
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:01,792
And don’t see your watch when you are meditating.

764
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,667
The time has to be kept for meditation, whatever it is.

765
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:11,667
It takes hardly any time.

766
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,208
I mean, even I have seen women take so much time

767
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,999
to get ready that even one tenth of that time

768
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,542
if you can give for your meditation,

769
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:23,667
you will be, you’ll not need much make-up.

770
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:26,792
Your skin will improve, your hair will improve, your face

771
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:29,999
will improve, everything will work out.

772
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,792
You don’t have to use anything, don’t have to use any

773
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,834
perfumes or anything whatsoever,

774
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:39,500
your body itself will be full of perfume.

775
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:41,500
Everything will be supplied.

776
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:45,834
So what we have to do is to first of all see

777
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:49,291
a surrender to the will of the God.

778
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:52,750
For Sahaja yogis it’s very important.

779
00:47:52,999 --> 00:47:55,959
Once you surrender, all your problems will be solved.

780
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:58,333
You surrender your problems also.

781
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,041
“I leave it to You. God, You solve the problem.

782
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:05,000
You do this.”

783
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:09,250
It is such a precise, such an effective,

784
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:15,333
such an efficient Power.

785
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:22,709
And above all it loves you, cares for you, it forgives you.

786
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:24,250
Even if you make mistakes it forgives,

787
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,250
“All right, it will be all right.”

788
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:29,125
It is wanting you all to be properly seated

789
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,250
in your thrones, enjoying your power.

790
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,999
So whatever is needed is done with great care.

791
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:43,458
So Navaratri is now the tenth day of Navaratri,

792
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:46,417
which is the most important for all of you,

793
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:53,792
is where this Paramchaitanya has become active.

794
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,000
And by its activity you should know it is become

795
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,125
very powerful,

796
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:04,959
and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you,

797
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:09,375
tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.”

798
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:12,250
It will take care of it.

799
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,834
All wrong things you have done,

800
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,291
all bad karmas you have done,

801
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:22,917
you will be rewarded for that, no doubt.

802
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,583
But if you are a realized soul, finished;

803
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,709
you are not on that level.

804
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:30,291
Like we can say that ordinary people

805
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,917
can be charged with criminality,

806
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:37,542
but supposing you rise to a higher status of kinghood,

807
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:40,083
then nobody can charge you.

808
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:42,417
You are above the law.

809
00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:45,667
In the same way, it has happened with you that nobody

810
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,208
can touch you, nobody can destroy you, and

811
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:53,125
nobody can hamper your progress.

812
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,250
Only it is you who can do it.

813
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,625
And nobody can harm Me,

814
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:02,375
no rakshasa can harm Me and has never done so.

815
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:07,041
But it is you who can harm Me;

816
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:11,959
because in this life I have taken you into My body,

817
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:16,083
and I am working it out in My body,

818
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:19,875
everything, your cleansing, everything,

819
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:22,125
which is a difficult task.

820
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,083
But in the beginning only,

821
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,208
this Power went to Adam and Eve and told them that

822
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:29,667
“you must have the Knowledge.”

823
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:33,333
So that promise has to be fulfilled

824
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:34,917
and that has to be done,

825
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,834
though it’s a very hazardous task.

826
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,917
Specially in the West I find it is very hazardous

827
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,834
to make people understand

828
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,583
that they are the part and parcel of the whole;

829
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,000
it’s a very difficult task.

830
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:52,834
They talk of big, big things.

831
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:54,500
I have seen people write articles nowadays

832
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,999
that nothing is substantial,

833
00:50:57,542 --> 00:51:02,667
this science is so limited, it has not solved our problem.

834
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,875
All these big, big books they are writing.

835
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:08,417
But if you write to them now that we have found out

836
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,333
something, they don’t want to see you.

837
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:13,083
They don’t want to meet you.

838
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,083
They have nothing to do with it.

839
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,000
So I don’t know what sort of seekers they are,

840
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:21,208
with such a big ego balloon in front, and they are seekers.

841
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:24,125
What are they seeking?

842
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,458
The ego, the balloon – supposing you have a big balloon

843
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,375
and you drop in the water, what will happen,

844
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:31,500
the balloon will take here and there and there and here,

845
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:34,125
you have no destination.

846
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,291
In the same way they are without any destination,

847
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,667
saying that “we are seeking, we are doing this,

848
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:45,166
we are doing that” – without any destination,

849
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:46,083
without any understanding,

850
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,750
without any meaning to their life,

851
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,999
absolutely useless people.

852
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,917
They are worth nothing.

853
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,999
We have to try as much as possible

854
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:55,792
how many we can save;

855
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,625
but those who do not want to come,

856
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,709
there’s no need,

857
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,417
there's no need for us.

858
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,583
They have to ask for it, they have to humble down and

859
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,500
they have to say that “We want to come to you” –

860
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,208
then only we’ll have.

861
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:12,291
I never write any letter to anyone,

862
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:14,291
“Please come to My program.”

863
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,792
All these gurus used to write to all the actors and

864
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:20,875
musicians and all that; I never write.

865
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,875
It’s just I am advertising Myself,

866
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,542
if you want to come you can come.

867
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:29,333
This advertisement also I was not willing.

868
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:34,917
So you can imagine that

869
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:41,500
we have now brought to the fruitfulness of the promise

870
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:46,500
given long time back, that you will have the Knowledge.

871
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:49,375
And you have the Knowledge.

872
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:51,999
But with this Knowledge you should be identified,

873
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,166
and you should know that you have this Knowledge,

874
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,999
and that this Knowledge can be given to others.

875
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:02,417
And we can transform this world into a beautiful world,

876
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:07,000
and fulfill the vision of Adi Shakti.

877
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:10,999
She created you for this purpose,

878
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,959
brought you out from human level to the superhuman

879
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,959
level for this purpose,

880
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,583
and that is what you have to do it.

881
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:25,750
And if you are today worshipping Me as the Jagadamba,

882
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,291
then know that

883
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:33,709
the Jagadamba itself is nothing else but Adi Shakti.

884
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:39,583
And unless and until you people rise to that level

885
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:42,834
of disciplining yourself in divine way –

886
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:45,458
like some people are still smoking,

887
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:48,500
“Oh, it’s all right, you know, we are ordinary people,

888
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:50,834
we can’t do it.” All right, get out.

889
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,999
Don’t worry about such people. They’ll be left behind,

890
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,875
useless people, where will they go?

891
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:00,625
They’ll be, I think, hanging in the limbo,

892
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:04,917
because there isn’t much place now left even in the hell,

893
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:07,333
so what is going to happen to them?

894
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:08,750
But all this is available to you;

895
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,000
only thing you must know

896
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:14,083
how to control yourself, control your senses.

897
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:18,000
In small, small things also we cannot control ourselves.

898
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:21,000
If we cannot control our own horses,

899
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:26,917
how can we reach that stage where we have to reach?

900
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:30,250
So in all these small things don’t waste your energies.

901
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:34,500
Just think, you have to meditate, you have to rise,

902
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:37,875
and you have to give it to others.

903
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:42,917
This is very much possible if you really love yourself.

904
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,792
If you love yourself, then you have to understand that

905
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:51,667
“See my body, see my mind, everything is given to me by

906
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:54,709
God. How beautiful it is.

907
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,125
And now it’s such a beautiful one, and it will be used by

908
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:03,333
God for such a great purpose.”

909
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:06,000
You are molded, you are made like that

910
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:09,709
up to this point; but now it is your free will,

911
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:13,999
and with this free will you have to rise.

912
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,542
With this free will you have to understand

913
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:22,625
what is to be done, and how to achieve that state.

914
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:33,667
It is nature’s reaction to things.

915
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,959
Always nature reacts to human beings.

916
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:41,250
Nature has no free will but God reacts,

917
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,125
and when the reaction of the God comes in

918
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:47,625
then we find all these things happening.

919
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,999
And I wish you could listen to My tape on Vishnumaya,

920
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:55,625
which is very, very well explaining why all these

921
00:55:55,959 --> 00:56:01,041
calamities come, why people die of these calamities.

922
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:04,417
It was a very good lecture, I hope you all will listen to it,

923
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:07,417
and listen to it again and again.

924
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:11,208
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

925
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:13,834
but should be something you should try to understand.

926
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:17,041
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

927
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,709
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

928
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:22,750
which none of them have said so far.

929
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,166
Because you have got your realization,

930
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,500
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

931
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:39,625
May God bless you.
