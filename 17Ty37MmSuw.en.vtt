00:02.120 --> 00:10.800
Today in the ashram I was telling you about
our subtleties, the subtleties we have already

00:10.800 --> 00:15.260
within us which we do not understand.

00:22.000 --> 00:33.000
Could be from our sub-conscious mind, could
be from our supra-conscious mind, could be

00:33.000 --> 00:36.720
from anywhere that is unknown to us;

00:41.140 --> 00:54.000
but the subtleties that lead us to our Universal
Being is the one we should bother about.

00:56.260 --> 01:02.000
We have sometimes heard about people who get
a hunch.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.000
Like somebody says, “I must buy this house,
I get a hunch that I should buy it."

01:08.480 --> 01:19.000
Or sometimes people say that, “I always
hear something, somebody tells me that this

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
should not be done."

01:27.460 --> 01:40.020
But all such suggestions must be judged that
they come to you to tell you about something

01:40.080 --> 01:52.540
of the beyond or something that concerns the
mundane life, like buying a house.

01:52.880 --> 02:00.860
God is not interested, very much, in what
house you buy, or how much money you make

02:00.860 --> 02:03.480
in a race: He is not!

02:03.480 --> 02:04.770
Because it is not important to God.

02:04.770 --> 02:08.190
One can understand that, isn’t it.

02:08.190 --> 02:14.450
Also that God is not interested in telling
you against someone in the ear that, “Beware

02:14.450 --> 02:18.620
of this man, he is a dangerous guy!”

02:18.620 --> 02:28.829
For, if somebody is going to harm you physically,
maybe to some part, we can say that God wants

02:28.829 --> 02:37.139
to preserve your body; but this body is also
not so important to God, because He can create

02:37.139 --> 02:40.560
it again!

02:40.560 --> 02:57.500
The most important thing that God has to give
us is His love, His connection with us, His

02:57.500 --> 03:03.970
Kingdom, His powers.

03:03.970 --> 03:13.220
So, the subtleties which we should really
accept within us, should be [those] which

03:13.220 --> 03:22.799
take you to the realm of joy, to the realm
of collectivity.

03:22.799 --> 03:31.360
Like suddenly you see a little child weeping
on the street and you feel [that] your heart

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
is weeping.

03:32.360 --> 03:40.200
Not that you feel guilty about it but you
feel one with the child and you feel you are

03:40.200 --> 03:51.950
weeping: then definitely that subtlety of
compassion that God is, is felt within you.

03:51.950 --> 04:01.919
But you don’t feel guilty about it, or you
don’t give him 2p (£0.02) or something

04:01.919 --> 04:02.989
to insult his ego.

04:02.989 --> 04:06.909
You do something very constructive about it,
extremely constructive, and you do it secretly;

04:06.909 --> 04:14.450
you don’t like to tell anybody about it
because you think it is vulgar to talk about

04:14.450 --> 04:16.260
your compassion.

04:16.260 --> 04:22.590
You do it so sweetly that the other fellow
doesn’t feel it.

04:22.590 --> 04:31.800
The whole act is such a beautifying thing.

04:31.800 --> 04:36.590
You don’t announce it in the paper and you
don’t publish it in “Who’s Who” or

04:36.590 --> 04:44.860
you do not go for a Nobel Prize or something
like that.

04:44.860 --> 04:51.840
This is all very vulgar for the Subtle Thing
that you worship within yourself, because

04:51.840 --> 05:01.129
that element within you is so much higher
than all these gross considerations that you

05:01.129 --> 05:05.560
just care for that.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.781
That is what God is.

05:06.781 --> 05:12.400
That’s how God shines within us, even before
our Realisation, before our connection with

05:12.400 --> 05:13.720
God.

05:13.720 --> 05:22.130
He shines in some people even before they
have been Realised.

05:22.130 --> 05:33.569
You see them, they are quiet people, they
are not show-offs, but they are very sincere,

05:33.569 --> 05:37.710
extremely kind-hearted.

05:37.710 --> 05:46.379
Such people when they face Sahaja Yoga, immediately
they get their vibrations.

05:46.379 --> 05:53.770
They are not people who are worried about
money, or they are worried about the gross

05:53.770 --> 06:06.789
things of life, or achievements that are so
stupid.

06:06.789 --> 06:12.330
Such people may exist as very ordinary people;
they need not be at the helm of affairs [and]

06:12.330 --> 06:16.500
mostly they are not, because they are not
ambitious.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.820
They do not want much success in life.

06:18.820 --> 06:23.229
They don’t see any point in being very successful.

06:23.229 --> 06:28.050
They might be something very ordinary.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.879
They might be doing something very important
also.

06:31.879 --> 06:43.740
But in their life, those who come in contact
with them, remember that: “Yes!

06:43.740 --> 06:51.420
There was a life or there is a life.

06:51.420 --> 06:56.229
Definitely there is a spark."

06:56.229 --> 07:04.020
Because such a person being so subtle does
not assert.

07:04.020 --> 07:09.520
Such a person cannot be very dominating, assertive,
argumentative.

07:09.520 --> 07:26.539
Such a person is quieter: his attention recedes
from all quarrels and all squabbles of life.

07:26.539 --> 07:35.160
But such a person has a great position in
the domain of God.

07:35.160 --> 07:51.210
That you have seen, how in Sahaja Yoga suddenly
you find people manifesting their divinity.

07:51.210 --> 07:57.349
Maybe such a person is too naïve for all
practical purposes.

07:57.349 --> 08:05.699
He might have been cheated, might have been
misled by some horrible people who try to

08:05.699 --> 08:11.990
exploit his seeking, but still it remains.

08:11.990 --> 08:22.889
This element suddenly gets ignited in Sahaja
Yoga and for such a person this is the most

08:22.889 --> 08:32.740
important thing: is to feel that Being which
always kept him away from all the rest of

08:32.740 --> 08:44.190
the ideologies and ‘great’ things and
have always given him strength and confidence

08:44.190 --> 08:45.190
and joy.

08:45.190 --> 08:50.190
He sees that clearly in Sahaj Yog.

08:50.190 --> 08:53.070
He adheres to it.

08:53.070 --> 08:58.839
And when he nourishes it, he’s amazed that
he has found himself.

08:58.839 --> 09:04.100
Then it becomes his life.

09:04.100 --> 09:17.860
There are thousands and thousands of people
everywhere.

09:17.860 --> 09:22.300
I say ‘thousands’, I don’t say ‘millions’.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.670
I am sorry, because they are not in millions.

09:25.670 --> 09:28.380
I am sorry for that.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.550
I wish they were.

09:30.550 --> 09:40.420
They could be counted in thousands only: maybe
twenty-one thousand, altogether, of that quality.

09:40.420 --> 09:45.000
There won’t be millions.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.160
But they will be making millions later on.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.910
They have to be a few!

09:50.910 --> 09:58.250
These are people of special calibre as I said.

09:58.250 --> 10:05.360
But it is necessary that everybody must be
given Self-realisation, every seed must be

10:05.360 --> 10:07.350
germinated.

10:07.350 --> 10:14.360
But how many would sprout into the trees and
would render fruit is a different point altogether.

10:14.360 --> 10:21.450
First and foremost thing is that, first let
them all be germinated.

10:21.450 --> 10:27.310
In due course, all those would come back.

10:27.310 --> 10:40.579
But some would prosper into their complete
manifestation, in their full bloom in a very

10:40.579 --> 10:45.320
short time, and that’s what matters the
most.

10:45.320 --> 10:50.610
The Divine is not interested in useless people,
It is interested in that special calibre.

10:50.610 --> 10:58.250
As I have told you: such a person may not
be at all rich, may be absolutely poor.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.360
That doesn’t mean that rich cannot be so!

11:01.360 --> 11:05.940
[They] can be very rich also.

11:05.940 --> 11:13.199
The outward appearances and status and all
these denominations do not matter at all.

11:13.199 --> 11:17.800
I am talking of the spark inside.

11:17.800 --> 11:30.790
They can be called as gentlemen, in simple
words, or if she is [female], a lady .

11:30.790 --> 11:38.339
A serene dignity manifests through their being.

11:38.339 --> 11:43.140
Sometimes it happens with their lives, also,
that they find it very difficult to keep to

11:43.140 --> 11:50.810
the norms of the mad world, and they may be
a little cynical sometimes, could be.

11:50.810 --> 11:59.990
But cynicism is not that subtlety, but they
may appear to people a little cynical.

11:59.990 --> 12:09.449
But they have to be very delightful and extremely
cheerful people.

12:09.449 --> 12:16.880
They cannot be morose, sad, emitting unhappiness
all around, and big bores with a B capital

12:16.880 --> 12:20.320
and O capital, R and E, all capital.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.750
That cannot be possible.

12:21.750 --> 12:28.089
They are extremely enjoyable and magnetic
and dynamic.

12:28.089 --> 12:38.190
They are complete in themselves because they
feel their subtlety, they live on that.

12:38.190 --> 12:48.410
Still their seeking is there, and the meaning
they try to find to their own being.

12:48.410 --> 12:54.100
And they want to identify their subtlety with
something that is universal.

12:54.100 --> 13:04.320
In their expression in any field that they
are, they appeal to the Universal Being within

13:04.320 --> 13:06.790
every one of us.

13:06.790 --> 13:18.910
Maybe, they may not get a Nobel Prize, but
[they have] a personality that emits that

13:18.910 --> 13:22.900
kind of congenial behaviour.

13:22.900 --> 13:32.670
Now if somebody is a person who is absolutely
satanic, he will abhor such a person, possibly.

13:32.670 --> 13:41.360
But this does not concern to the subtler being
because he is at a level which is not tarnished

13:41.360 --> 13:48.300
by gross attacks.

13:48.300 --> 13:56.279
That is what one has to recognise in oneself
and one should feel very proud and fortunate

13:56.279 --> 13:58.649
that that exists within us.

13:58.649 --> 14:05.180
No more one has to feel lonely, because now
we are so many of us, of the same creed and

14:05.180 --> 14:07.500
the same type.

14:07.500 --> 14:23.110
And so many of us who have found out what
is the reason, what expresses it, what manifests

14:23.110 --> 14:36.110
it within us, what are the Deities that govern
this subtlety within us: what you may call

14:36.110 --> 14:40.509
the archetype images; archetype images are
there which are real, not imaginary, within

14:40.509 --> 14:41.569
us.

14:41.569 --> 14:49.000
And all these discoveries, then make you feel
confident of all these vague subtleties you

14:49.000 --> 14:54.510
have been enjoying so far.

14:54.510 --> 15:09.990
A long time back, I had given a simile like
this: that a mother bird puts the little child,

15:09.990 --> 15:20.519
or you can call, the baby bird, away from
her.

15:20.519 --> 15:27.780
And the baby bird feels the mother’s warmth,
and she wants that.

15:27.780 --> 15:32.290
And she is calling for the mother.

15:32.290 --> 15:37.520
That calling itself is the last thing it knows
of.

15:37.520 --> 15:42.090
That’s the highest thing for the baby bird,
nothing else matters.

15:42.090 --> 15:47.389
You may give anything to the baby bird [but]
it won’t be happy, it needs that.

15:47.389 --> 15:53.000
It needs that warmth, that love.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.320
And then it expresses itself by spreading
its tiny little wings around and tries to

16:00.320 --> 16:04.190
hop and to express it.

16:04.190 --> 16:12.029
And then out of complete joy of its hopping,
the mother bird herself comes down and engulfs

16:12.029 --> 16:22.029
that child into the wings, giving all the
warmth necessary.

16:22.029 --> 16:31.480
It is that happening within us which takes
place when the Kundalini rises.

16:31.480 --> 16:46.700
The Kundalini is the part of that warmth within
us, of that compassion.

16:46.700 --> 17:00.380
It’s a part of that beauty, it’s the part
of that desire.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.009
Desire…

17:02.009 --> 17:04.230
What’s the matter?

17:04.230 --> 17:07.439
The door is open or not.

17:07.439 --> 17:12.400
Come in, come in!

17:12.400 --> 17:34.010
They are waiting because they [don’t want
to disturb].

17:34.010 --> 17:35.010
What’s the matter?

17:35.010 --> 17:36.010
Yogi: Sorry we’re late Shri Mataji.

17:36.010 --> 17:37.010
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right.

17:37.010 --> 17:38.010
Come in!

17:38.010 --> 17:40.140
So the desire of God is placed within us as
Kundalini.

17:40.140 --> 17:56.370
And when all the external desires dim out
within us and the real desire to be one with

17:56.370 --> 18:06.380
the Almighty remains, the Kundalini can rise
spontaneously.

18:06.380 --> 18:15.430
That has happened to few people, very few
people: you can say like Buddha, Mahavira.

18:15.430 --> 18:27.700
These people were human beings and they achieved
godliness: not by forcing yourself to get

18:27.700 --> 18:41.090
rid of your desires, but through wisdom, understanding
that, “This is stupidity, this is foolishness.

18:41.090 --> 18:44.390
Where am I going?”

18:44.390 --> 18:47.760
Just the wisdom acting.

18:47.760 --> 18:58.519
Not a rational understanding, but the being
itself rejecting.

18:58.519 --> 19:04.690
Such stages are achieved through one’s own
evolutionary forces.

19:04.690 --> 19:22.130
Also, there are so many other happenings,
or the other supports, which bring forth this

19:22.130 --> 19:27.240
kind of spontaneous rising of the Kundalini.

19:27.240 --> 19:34.000
There is somebody who wants to come and see
me because he said, “Mother you are an authority

19:34.000 --> 19:46.120
on Kundalini and there are many books written
about Kundalini, and I have to write a criticism:

19:46.120 --> 19:54.740
that the Kundalini, when she rises, you start
jumping and when she rises she gives you heat,

19:54.740 --> 20:02.390
or you burn off yourself or you jump through
the roof or something like that."

20:02.390 --> 20:11.580
All sorts of horrifying things and nobody
wants to listen to anything about Kundalini.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.790
If you read those books, you’ll be really
frightened.

20:13.790 --> 20:20.429
I think it is absolutely satanic.

20:20.429 --> 20:27.330
And he wants to know about the ‘authentic
description’ of Kundalini.

20:27.330 --> 20:42.290
And I told him that, “These books, all of
them, should be thrown away into the sea!

20:42.290 --> 20:50.870
Because they are written by people who have
had no experience of Kundalini, of any kind."

20:50.870 --> 21:01.159
Because they were people who must have been
doing some sort of an ‘adventure’ somewhere.

21:01.159 --> 21:10.309
Like some people believe that even finding
of God is another job: if you have no job,

21:10.309 --> 21:15.950
better find God, at least He might help you
to survive!

21:15.950 --> 21:26.220
Some people do believe that instead of sitting
idle, why not try to find God, would be a

21:26.220 --> 21:27.710
good idea.

21:27.710 --> 21:41.450
And when such a thing happens and they venture
into the search of God then, first, they are

21:41.450 --> 21:49.409
hit by The Guard of Holiness.

21:49.409 --> 21:56.900
Because they are not entitled, they are not
holy, they have no protocol about God Almighty,

21:56.900 --> 22:01.110
they have no respect, they are just doing
it because they are ego-oriented, they want

22:01.110 --> 22:08.299
to have another ego-trip and they want to
become ‘great explorers’ of Kundalini.

22:08.299 --> 22:14.500
But you cannot do it.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.850
You have to have proper protocol.

22:16.850 --> 22:34.800
They lack all humility, all holiness, righteousness
and all that is needed, to ask the help of

22:34.800 --> 22:37.169
the Kundalini.

22:37.169 --> 22:44.740
And they are hit by the first Deity, which
sits in the triangular bone, which they can

22:44.740 --> 22:51.090
also see sometimes — they have seen him,
with a temper; in red colour, they call it

22:51.090 --> 22:54.530
or maybe in orange colour.

22:54.530 --> 23:10.380
Let him come, there’s somebody waiting there.

23:10.380 --> 23:22.330
This Deity is a very powerful Deity, and it
is the wisest Deity, because it is the Deity

23:22.330 --> 23:26.240
which gives us wisdom.

23:26.240 --> 23:34.771
You need not argue with the gentleman: It
knows you out and out.

23:34.771 --> 23:38.539
It knows every bit of you.

23:38.539 --> 23:44.460
If you tell some story, It would say, “All
right, I have heard all this story before,

23:44.460 --> 23:50.929
now will you please keep to yourself!”

23:50.929 --> 24:00.700
It understands how genuine you are, how truthful
you are.

24:00.700 --> 24:08.820
And this Deity is the one which has given
these bad experiences to these Kundalini seekers

24:08.820 --> 24:10.950
and writers of Kundalini.

24:10.950 --> 24:21.309
It’s a sad thing that a thief comes to the
town and he’s caught up by the police, he’s

24:21.309 --> 24:27.130
put in the jail, and when he goes back to
the village, he tells them, “Oh God!

24:27.130 --> 24:28.130
Terrible!

24:28.130 --> 24:29.130
Never go to the city!

24:29.130 --> 24:33.260
They catch hold of you, put you in the jail,
don’t give you food to eat, and then you

24:33.260 --> 24:36.590
cannot meet anyone for three years, and then
they send you back!”

24:36.590 --> 24:39.710
And [so] everybody is frightened of going
to the city.

24:39.710 --> 24:40.730
It is like that.

24:40.730 --> 24:49.230
Or the thief who goes to the bank from the
back door, or sometimes they dig a tunnel

24:49.230 --> 24:54.220
or something like that: great people in this
world, you know, they have time to do all

24:54.220 --> 24:59.621
kinds of nonsensical things, to dig a tunnel
to get some gold pieces, or something and

24:59.621 --> 25:06.190
dig another tunnel to go to the jail directly.

25:06.190 --> 25:21.919
So, these stupid people, when they try to
do all these gross things, like going to a

25:21.919 --> 25:29.100
bank through the back door and are caught
up; if you go and ask them their experiences,

25:29.100 --> 25:30.650
they say, “Oh horrible experience!

25:30.650 --> 25:32.200
Never go near the bank!

25:32.200 --> 25:35.260
You don’t put your money there, no, not
at all!”

25:35.260 --> 25:37.500
You ask them, “Why, what’s the matter?”

25:37.500 --> 25:41.049
They say, “No they catch hold of you!

25:41.049 --> 25:46.899
You know, terrible people in that bank!”

25:46.899 --> 25:53.280
They could even go further with it to warn
you.

25:53.280 --> 26:01.850
If they are cunning, they may come by the
front door and tell you, “Why go and put

26:01.850 --> 26:06.130
money in the bank, you give it to me: I can
look after it better.

26:06.130 --> 26:08.280
It’s a better idea!

26:08.280 --> 26:17.559
And if you want, I can you to twenty percent
more than the bank does!”

26:17.559 --> 26:25.039
And if you trust their cunning faces, you
just hand over the money and you are lost

26:25.039 --> 26:26.039
and the bank is lost to you.

26:26.039 --> 26:27.039
And then you may say that, “What is this
bank?”

26:27.039 --> 26:38.440
In front of the bank there are people standing
like this.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.580
What are these religions after all?

26:40.580 --> 26:48.669
What are these gurus in the name of God, standing
in the front door, trying to rob others?

26:48.669 --> 26:53.860
What sort of a God is this?

26:53.860 --> 27:00.980
So you start blaming the bank for the thieves
who have cheated you.

27:00.980 --> 27:04.830
You must learn to separate both.

27:04.830 --> 27:13.860
This discretion is important even when you
try to know about Kundalini, that Kundalini

27:13.860 --> 27:26.090
is the desire of God to bestow upon you His
kingdom.

27:26.090 --> 27:30.980
The prince has to become the king.

27:30.980 --> 27:42.740
And such a beautiful desire cannot be gross,
cannot be ugly, cannot be painful, cannot

27:42.740 --> 27:51.110
be troublesome, cannot be hideous and heinous.

27:51.110 --> 27:58.230
Once you understand this, then you will respect
your Kundalini.

27:58.230 --> 28:03.549
She is your Mother because She is going to
give you your second birth.

28:03.549 --> 28:14.480
And She has been with you for ages, in so
many lives, just waiting for this great time

28:14.480 --> 28:17.850
when She is going to give you your Realisation.

28:17.850 --> 28:36.690
I am telling you this because I know how beautiful
She is.

28:36.690 --> 28:48.159
So many have really tortured Her, have frozen
Her, made Her into a stone by cursing Her

28:48.159 --> 28:59.500
but still She is breathing feebly, with the
hope that a day may come when She may be able

28:59.500 --> 29:07.370
to give you what She has been living for.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.370
This is Kundalini.

29:08.370 --> 29:10.740
This is Kundalini awakening.

29:10.740 --> 29:19.769
We have to give up our gross understanding
of Kundalini.

29:19.769 --> 29:23.640
Like you would see in Sahaja Yoga when you
will be coming, you have seen it all your

29:23.640 --> 29:28.740
life — and you will see it more — that
so many of them just come to me for getting

29:28.740 --> 29:31.850
all right in health, only for that.

29:31.850 --> 29:34.190
“I have got a back pain."

29:34.190 --> 29:36.860
“I have got a stomach trouble."

29:36.860 --> 29:41.610
“I have got arthritis,” or, “I have
got diabetes."

29:41.610 --> 29:49.570
There’s nothing that is not there, and “I
am sure you will cure me!”

29:49.570 --> 30:01.760
It’s quite a queer situation!

30:01.760 --> 30:14.730
Because the request that I should cure is
all right, but what is the right for this

30:14.730 --> 30:16.220
request?

30:16.220 --> 30:25.720
Why do you want that Divine should cure you?

30:25.720 --> 30:27.650
For what?

30:27.650 --> 30:33.179
For what purpose?

30:33.179 --> 30:42.779
If Divine has to only cure people, it would
open lots of hospitals and get some Nobel

30:42.779 --> 30:45.399
Prize or something.

30:45.399 --> 30:58.360
But it is not the desire of Divine to go on
curing people.

30:58.360 --> 31:03.779
It would be stupid to just cure people who
are good for nothing, useless, absolutely

31:03.779 --> 31:05.230
useless, thoroughly wasted.

31:05.230 --> 31:08.139
Why should it work [like this]?

31:08.139 --> 31:09.600
It has intelligence.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.240
It has wisdom.

31:11.240 --> 31:21.490
Is it going to waste its energy on curing
people who are good for nothing, useless?

31:21.490 --> 31:30.380
Are you going to clean this lamp if you cannot
put any light in it?

31:30.380 --> 31:43.039
If you have no utility, in the Divine sense,
why should Divine cure you?

31:43.039 --> 31:49.080
So all those who believe, “Oh Mother, you
must cure people,” and that you should cure

31:49.080 --> 32:00.000
people, must know that all this is the work
of Kundalini when She rises: She nourishes

32:00.000 --> 32:17.310
you, She cleanses you, because in this being
of yours, God Himself is going to manifest,

32:17.310 --> 32:27.269
because this temple of your body is to be
cleansed, because God has to enter into it.

32:27.269 --> 32:37.440
That’s why the Divine respects and cleanses
you and helps you.

32:37.440 --> 32:45.000
Even it may help yours, means say a mother
is there and her child is not all right, she’s

32:45.000 --> 32:51.120
worried, so the Divine may cure the child,
just to give peace to the mother who is going

32:51.120 --> 32:53.590
to manifest God’s powers.

32:53.590 --> 33:03.230
Because God’s power is the integrated power
of all the powers.

33:03.230 --> 33:17.460
You can see here, on the left hand side: all
the desires are manifested; the power of desire.

33:17.460 --> 33:26.720
That means all the desires you have can be
fulfilled and blessed by this power.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.919
Can you believe it?

33:30.919 --> 33:42.510
It has the power to fulfil all your desires,
but after Realisation, not before that.

33:42.510 --> 33:50.330
And after Realisation, your priorities change
and your desires become different.

33:50.330 --> 33:59.990
Then you do not ask for money or for children,
or something like that but you start asking

33:59.990 --> 34:04.779
for something of a very eternal nature.

34:04.779 --> 34:07.500
The priorities change.

34:07.500 --> 34:13.180
You start seeing your desire in a different
aspect because light has come now.

34:13.180 --> 34:18.390
For example, in the darkness when you are
walking, you find that there’s a big black

34:18.390 --> 34:23.350
bang in front of you, you can’t walk, so
you desire, “Oh this bang should be removed!”

34:23.350 --> 34:26.900
But when the light comes in you find there’s
no bang, nothing!

34:26.900 --> 34:28.420
It’s all open for you.

34:28.420 --> 34:31.420
So your desire is that you should be able
to see everything.

34:31.420 --> 34:35.460
The whole priority changes.

34:35.460 --> 34:46.370
So this Left Side has the power to fulfil
all your desires.

34:46.370 --> 35:01.340
And the Right Side, where you see this yellow
line, which looks so slender, has the power

35:01.340 --> 35:14.490
to act, to fulfil all your desires and the
desires of God.

35:14.490 --> 35:25.320
Here I take you a little subtler: What are
these acting powers?

35:25.320 --> 35:26.990
Tremendous!

35:26.990 --> 35:35.670
For example, this side is manifesting all
the five elements.

35:35.670 --> 35:40.990
All the five elements await your asking.

35:40.990 --> 35:44.950
You see this fire?

35:44.950 --> 35:48.190
You ask this fire, “Take away my problem!”

35:48.190 --> 35:49.570
It takes away.

35:49.570 --> 35:51.700
You have seen it.

35:51.700 --> 36:00.420
Water element: you go to the sea, and just
go and stand in the sea, after Realisation.

36:00.420 --> 36:03.800
You find the whole thing is sucked in.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.650
The Mother Earth sucks all your problems.

36:06.650 --> 36:07.860
It’s so fantastic.

36:07.860 --> 36:11.570
I was in Kuala Lumpur, you may write to him
and find out.

36:11.570 --> 36:15.990
He was the speaker of the assembly: [I was]
at his residence, and there were at least

36:15.990 --> 36:17.480
thousand people.

36:17.480 --> 36:21.640
And sixty percent were sick, and forty were
attending to them.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.840
I was alone: no Sahaja Yogi, nothing.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.764
Luckily, they had a big garden and it was
quite warm day.

36:27.764 --> 36:30.610
I said, “All right, let’s go in the garden!”

36:30.610 --> 36:35.960
I made them sit in the garden and I asked
the Mother Earth: I said, “You better now

36:35.960 --> 36:38.960
do the job!

36:38.960 --> 36:41.740
And I am sitting down."

36:41.740 --> 36:44.690
And everybody started feeling better.

36:44.690 --> 36:57.220
One thing I had never before seen being cured
was this polio.

36:57.220 --> 37:01.150
And a little boy, about eight years of age
was sitting on the ground: his parents had

37:01.150 --> 37:03.430
brought him on their back and put him down
there.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.970
He just got up and started walking!

37:05.970 --> 37:09.580
And the parents suddenly realised he’s missing:
“Where is he gone?”

37:09.580 --> 37:10.580
And he was running in the garden!

37:10.580 --> 37:12.040
It’s a fact!

37:12.040 --> 37:14.480
Some blind started seeing things.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.940
It’s most remarkable.

37:15.940 --> 37:19.480
You may write to him, I will give you his
address.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.480
It’s a fact, it happened.

37:20.480 --> 37:26.860
And for everyone the whole miracle was so
simple that they took it for granted; they

37:26.860 --> 37:34.470
didn’t find that there was anything so fantastic:
“After all Mother is here, so it has to

37:34.470 --> 37:35.710
work out!”

37:35.710 --> 37:38.771
They did not rationalise it or anything — took
it for granted.

37:38.771 --> 37:52.180
And even today, if I go there, this may happen.

37:52.180 --> 38:03.910
All the elements are waiting for your orders.

38:03.910 --> 38:12.940
So the great angels on the left hand side
communicate to the right hand side angels:

38:12.940 --> 38:13.990
all the angels of the world.

38:13.990 --> 38:20.540
Though it may sound fantastic to many, but
they exist, and you have to just ask their

38:20.540 --> 38:21.540
help.

38:21.540 --> 38:31.580
That is what is a mantra: is the awakened
calling, or you can say, calling which has

38:31.580 --> 38:32.580
meaning.

38:32.580 --> 38:38.280
For example: a policeman blows his whistle,
it has a meaning, but anybody else starts

38:38.280 --> 38:43.700
whistling, people will put him in the jail.

38:43.700 --> 38:56.360
In the same way, the mantra is the authority
which is applied with the word.

38:56.360 --> 39:02.970
And with this you can awaken all these forces
within you.

39:02.970 --> 39:08.940
They are so tremendous that I’ll take at
least seven lectures to describe [and] which

39:08.940 --> 39:16.390
I will describe some time; of which you are
aware already, most of you: how they work

39:16.390 --> 39:19.220
and how they help you.

39:19.220 --> 39:30.210
Even we take them for granted, Sahaja Yogis,
because if you notice in life, has one great

39:30.210 --> 39:39.910
mystery, I don’t know if you are aware of
that mystery: that whatever fantastic we get,

39:39.910 --> 39:48.340
somehow or other, we get it in such a way
that we take it for granted.

39:48.340 --> 39:50.920
It’s very sweet, isn’t it?

39:50.920 --> 39:56.280
Supposing every time we get a shock or we
get frightened, and we say, “Oh God!”

39:56.280 --> 39:58.570
We would become neurotic, or funny people.

39:58.570 --> 40:10.280
But the way it settles down within us like
a leaf falling from the tree and drying out

40:10.280 --> 40:15.970
and just touches the ground softly, and the
ground also takes it for granted.

40:15.970 --> 40:19.620
In the same way, all this we take for granted.

40:19.620 --> 40:24.290
For example, our eyes, our nose, our forehead,
everything we take for granted, our human

40:24.290 --> 40:29.080
bearing, everything we take it for granted,
in the same way take even Sahaj Yog for granted:

40:29.080 --> 40:34.880
and that’s the best way.

40:34.880 --> 40:42.650
But do we take it for granted, the way we
take our being for granted?

40:42.650 --> 40:44.610
Is the question.

40:44.610 --> 40:52.050
For example, we take it for granted our hand:
so if I have to lift my purse, I lift my hand,

40:52.050 --> 40:53.050
like this.

40:53.050 --> 40:59.300
When we take Sahaja Yoga for granted, do we
use our vibrations for everything?

40:59.300 --> 41:05.810
Because now in our vibratory awareness, if
we have taken it for granted, we should completely

41:05.810 --> 41:08.010
stand in it and work it out.

41:08.010 --> 41:10.190
I mean, I do that way.

41:10.190 --> 41:13.500
To me everything is nothing but vibrations.

41:13.500 --> 41:17.060
Everything I do is nothing but vibrations.

41:17.060 --> 41:23.300
All my movements and everything is nothing
but vibrations.

41:23.300 --> 41:28.040
I take for granted Myself very well.

41:28.040 --> 41:34.310
I wish you could take for granted all that
is within you, the way we take [other things]

41:34.310 --> 41:35.330
for granted.

41:35.330 --> 41:41.280
Say, I give you a television and you just
take it and you put it to the mains and you

41:41.280 --> 41:42.400
see the thing.

41:42.400 --> 41:50.230
You do not jump and say, “Oh God, look at
the miracle!

41:50.230 --> 41:51.230
Imagine!”

41:51.230 --> 41:53.450
Nothing, you just take it for granted.

41:53.450 --> 42:00.520
Anything: computer or any marvellous thing
that you see — you take it for granted.

42:00.520 --> 42:11.690
In the same way, maybe in the beginning one
feels, “How is it possible?”

42:11.690 --> 42:15.670
One may start thinking like that for a while.

42:15.670 --> 42:22.390
Too much thinking is also not good, because
then you are not take it for granted.

42:22.390 --> 42:28.120
But afterwards, you must use it left and right!

42:28.120 --> 42:29.780
Just try!

42:29.780 --> 42:31.190
You are empowered.

42:31.190 --> 42:34.040
Now your television is open.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.330
It has started working.

42:36.330 --> 42:47.000
You are a great instrument and created [over]
thousands of years with such care.

42:47.000 --> 42:55.260
You do not know what forces have been used:
how delicately and how dynamically.

42:55.260 --> 43:04.310
You have no idea as to how all the stars and
all the heavens are moved up and down to create

43:04.310 --> 43:05.640
this beautiful being that is the human personality.

43:05.640 --> 43:13.080
You have no idea of that.

43:13.080 --> 43:18.800
And now, when Sahaj Yoga takes place, also
you must know that Sahaj Yoga’s working

43:18.800 --> 43:24.530
has been worked out in the very dynamic manner.

43:24.530 --> 43:30.100
There are tremendous subtle forces which are
working it out.

43:30.100 --> 43:36.700
You cannot make your Kundalini pulsate without
something special happening there.

43:36.700 --> 43:42.410
Just think of a remote control that works
out your Kundalini!

43:42.410 --> 43:47.330
Just think of it!

43:47.330 --> 43:56.190
There must be a tremendous mechanism!

43:56.190 --> 44:02.930
Why I say, take it for granted [is] because
if you try first to open all your remote controls

44:02.930 --> 44:14.090
and see for yourself and then breaking all
of them, you start starting your television,

44:14.090 --> 44:18.170
you will find the whole thing is finished
and you have a headache, and you don’t want

44:18.170 --> 44:19.420
to see anything.

44:19.420 --> 44:25.870
That’s what happens to Sahaj Yogis, specially
in the West, because as soon as they get their

44:25.870 --> 44:31.410
Realisation they go home and make a nice dissection
by thinking about it.

44:31.410 --> 44:34.330
They didn’t get Realisation by thinking!

44:34.330 --> 44:36.930
It’s a simple thing!

44:36.930 --> 44:39.300
And then they go back.

44:39.300 --> 44:43.210
And then after seven months they come back
and say, “Mother I have been to you seven

44:43.210 --> 44:49.220
months back, now I think I was wrong."

44:49.220 --> 44:55.630
So I say: why lose those seven months?

44:55.630 --> 45:07.170
Today I hope you all will feel our subtleties
flowering.

45:07.170 --> 45:18.410
Let us take ourselves down to those subtle
points which we respected and the Kundalini

45:18.410 --> 45:21.900
will nourish it — the attention.

45:21.900 --> 45:29.220
Wherever your attention goes now, this attention
is enlightened attention.

45:29.220 --> 45:33.900
Today I received a letter from Australia,
somebody has written, “Mother, we had sent

45:33.900 --> 45:43.300
you a picture of someone, husband and wife,
and they are better since you gave them bandhan."

45:43.300 --> 45:46.370
And they were very serious patients.

45:46.370 --> 45:49.450
And they are really better.

45:49.450 --> 45:51.920
But I did nothing!

45:51.920 --> 45:55.000
Really I don’t do anything.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.740
I just looked at the photograph, that’s
all.

45:58.740 --> 46:02.660
I didn’t even give bandhan, you know, to
be very frank.

46:02.660 --> 46:03.660
I just looked at it, that’s all.

46:03.660 --> 46:09.151
I didn’t think, I just looked at it, and
it worked.

46:09.151 --> 46:10.151
Really I don’t do anything!

46:10.151 --> 46:11.151
You people thank me for nothing at all, you
know.

46:11.151 --> 46:14.650
When you don’t do anything and people thank
you, you don’t know what to say so you go

46:14.650 --> 46:18.430
on saying, “All right, thank you for thanking!”
(laughing)

46:18.430 --> 46:26.630
So again, thank you for being here.

46:26.630 --> 46:30.020
And we’ll have some meditation.

46:30.020 --> 46:35.790
I hope we’ll touch some deeper stratas within
yourselves.

46:35.790 --> 46:37.110
May God bless you all!

46:37.110 --> 46:44.890
You have come for the first time both of you?

46:44.890 --> 46:46.580
You have been once before?

46:46.580 --> 46:47.830
What about you?

46:47.830 --> 46:50.950
Lady: It’s my first time.

46:50.950 --> 46:53.450
Shri Mataji: First time?

46:53.450 --> 46:54.450
Good.

46:54.450 --> 46:55.450
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

46:55.450 --> 46:56.450
Seeker: Yes.

46:56.450 --> 46:57.450
Shri Mataji: All right, so you haven’t lost
it!

46:57.450 --> 46:59.550
And what about you, are you feeling the cool
breeze in the hand?

46:59.550 --> 47:00.550
Seeker: No

47:00.550 --> 47:01.700
Shri Mataji: Not yet?

47:01.700 --> 47:03.751
All right, it will work out, it will work
out.

47:03.751 --> 47:04.751
What about you?

47:04.751 --> 47:08.060
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

47:08.060 --> 47:09.370
No?

47:09.370 --> 47:11.550
How are you?

47:11.550 --> 47:15.970
Yogi: Feeling the cool breeze Mother.

47:15.970 --> 47:19.460
Shri Mataji: Well good!

47:19.460 --> 47:20.460
Good!

47:20.460 --> 47:21.460
Good!

47:21.460 --> 47:22.820
Are you all right?

47:22.820 --> 47:23.860
Good.What about you?

47:23.860 --> 47:25.580
Lady: I don’t feel today.

47:25.580 --> 47:27.310
Shri Mataji: You are thinking!

47:27.310 --> 47:28.340
Now, please!

47:28.340 --> 47:29.340
Please!

47:29.340 --> 47:31.430
You see, thinking stops it.

47:31.430 --> 47:32.430
How?

47:32.430 --> 47:35.210
Between the two thoughts — for example,
a thought rises and falls off, and another

47:35.210 --> 47:42.990
thought rises and falls off — between these
two thoughts there is a little gap, that gap

47:42.990 --> 47:43.990
has expanded.

47:43.990 --> 47:49.720
For example, the thought that was, is the
past and that is going to come is the future.

47:49.720 --> 47:54.300
In between is the space called as vilamba.

47:54.300 --> 47:59.160
And when you start thinking about it you jump
onto the cusp of these thoughts.

47:59.160 --> 48:02.190
You are beyond thought.

48:02.190 --> 48:12.190
An Indian will understand it faster, because
it’s called as Nirvichar Samadhi: is the

48:12.190 --> 48:14.290
state where you become thoughtlessly aware.

48:14.290 --> 48:16.330
They know that that’s what it is.

48:16.330 --> 48:19.140
You cannot think about it, because rationality
is a limited thing.

48:19.140 --> 48:23.720
So you have to jump into the space.

48:23.720 --> 48:30.980
When you are in the space then you are not
in the capsule.

48:30.980 --> 48:36.900
But if you are in the capsule you are not
in the space.

48:36.900 --> 48:39.250
Better now?

48:39.250 --> 48:41.590
Lady: Yes.

48:41.590 --> 48:50.060
Shri Mataji: See how it works.

48:50.060 --> 48:54.780
Even your problems, I mean, I have given big
lectures on this, how to solve your problems,

48:54.780 --> 48:56.280
in your thoughtless awareness.

48:56.280 --> 49:04.880
That’s the mouth, that’s the mouth where
you have to put the problem in, and it works

49:04.880 --> 49:07.700
in your thoughtless awareness.

49:07.700 --> 49:13.410
It’s the most precious thing, is to keep
it up.

49:13.410 --> 49:19.980
Are you getting now cool breeze?

49:19.980 --> 49:21.080
Correct.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.280
What about you, not yet?

49:23.280 --> 49:24.280
Now watch me here.

49:24.280 --> 49:25.720
Are you thinking still?

49:25.720 --> 49:28.210
All right, you watch me without thinking.

49:28.210 --> 49:30.300
That’s another way you can do it.

49:30.300 --> 49:35.210
My face is such a funny thing that if you
watch it for a long time, you will have no

49:35.210 --> 49:36.530
thoughts!

49:36.530 --> 49:38.460
Just it is something very funny you know!

49:38.460 --> 49:43.620
Today it happened: I went to the tailor and
he just looked at me and he didn’t know

49:43.620 --> 49:45.070
what he was trying to do.

49:45.070 --> 49:53.620
And my husband said, “Is he stunned or what
happened?”

49:53.620 --> 49:54.620
(laughter)

49:54.620 --> 49:57.960
Now watch me without thinking!

49:57.960 --> 50:00.210
Better!

50:00.210 --> 50:02.460
See!

50:02.460 --> 50:07.820
This is the face!

50:07.820 --> 50:10.020
This is needed.

50:10.020 --> 50:12.100
What am I to do?

50:12.100 --> 50:15.900
I mean, this is the problem with me.

50:15.900 --> 50:19.470
I don’t know how to explain myself!

50:19.470 --> 50:22.020
Aap ka aa rahe thanda?

50:22.020 --> 50:23.040
Thik hai.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.320
(Hindi: Are you getting cool?

50:25.320 --> 50:26.320
Good!)

50:26.320 --> 50:27.320
How are you now?

50:27.320 --> 50:28.320
Better?

50:28.320 --> 50:31.980
Everyday you will be better and better and
better.

50:31.980 --> 50:34.420
How are you?

50:34.420 --> 50:38.810
Lady: A bit better.

50:38.810 --> 50:39.840
Not so good as yesterday.

50:39.840 --> 50:42.600
I felt a lot of cool breeze yesterday but
not so much today.

50:42.600 --> 50:45.140
Shri Mataji: So, that means you are going
down a little.

50:45.140 --> 50:46.140
All right?

50:46.140 --> 50:49.870
So now keep it up.

50:49.870 --> 50:57.220
You see, it is like a washing machine, I can
say.

50:57.220 --> 51:00.420
It goes round and round, a little bit, for
cleansing.

51:00.420 --> 51:03.780
All right?

51:03.780 --> 51:04.780
They call it Mahamaya.

51:04.780 --> 51:06.760
They call it “The Great Illusion”.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.030
Mother is a great illusion, because She puts
us into illusion.

51:09.030 --> 51:10.120
I do not!

51:10.120 --> 51:12.480
We tell God, “Lead us not into temptation."

51:12.480 --> 51:14.690
Now why will He take you to temptation?

51:14.690 --> 51:18.480
But you do go.

51:18.480 --> 51:22.740
So you tell God that, “You keep us away
from that!”

51:22.740 --> 51:25.960
That’s all you tell God: that, “You keep
us away from thinking!”

51:25.960 --> 51:37.970
And it works.

51:37.970 --> 51:43.930
Better?

51:43.930 --> 51:46.000
Your face looks different immediately.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.020
Keep it up!

51:49.020 --> 51:52.050
Now all right.

51:52.050 --> 51:56.080
Good, once it clicks!

51:56.080 --> 51:57.760
But you must come every Monday.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.910
See how people have gone up!

51:58.910 --> 52:00.880
How many people they are giving Realisation?

52:00.880 --> 52:02.560
All right?

52:02.560 --> 52:10.130
You must come, this is the most pleasurable
thing!

52:10.130 --> 52:11.130
You don’t know.

52:11.130 --> 52:13.840
It is little bit you have to develop the taste.

52:13.840 --> 52:17.340
Because you are used to the gross stuff, you
see.

52:17.340 --> 52:20.790
Like somebody who is used to wines cannot
give up.

52:20.790 --> 52:26.680
But once the wine from within starts pouring
in, you just don’t want it!

52:26.680 --> 52:27.680
Better.

52:27.680 --> 52:31.370
Somebody has come I believe.

52:31.370 --> 52:32.370
Hmmm!

52:32.370 --> 52:34.500
He’s better now.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.070
All right?

52:36.070 --> 52:38.420
What’s happened Gavin?

52:38.420 --> 52:56.560
I

52:56.560 --> 52:57.560
see that so clear!

52:57.560 --> 52:58.560
Why?

52:58.560 --> 52:59.560
You’ve been having a holiday or what?

52:59.560 --> 53:00.980
It’s horrible, absolutely!

53:00.980 --> 53:04.610
Very badly caught up!

53:04.610 --> 53:06.430
What’s the matter?

53:06.430 --> 53:10.360
You had a bad cold?

53:10.360 --> 53:13.130
Come here!

53:13.130 --> 53:18.310
I have never seen you being caught that much.

53:18.310 --> 53:35.100
You had exposed yourself I think [it was]
the sunning or what happened?

53:35.100 --> 53:42.300
Terrible!

53:42.300 --> 53:49.510
Better?

53:49.510 --> 53:50.510
Be careful!

53:50.510 --> 54:00.370
You see, these days it’s very sunny, looks
sunny, but maybe…You have to look after

54:00.370 --> 54:02.810
yourself.

54:02.810 --> 54:19.870
This country is full of this problem.

54:19.870 --> 54:24.750
Now better.

54:24.750 --> 54:29.630
What’s it?

54:29.630 --> 54:32.060
Vishuddhi.

54:32.060 --> 54:42.470
It rises from Vishuddhi to this.

54:42.470 --> 54:43.470
Haa!

54:43.470 --> 54:44.470
Better now.

54:44.470 --> 54:51.440
You sit or a while and it will work out in
the…You see it rises from the Vishuddhi

54:51.440 --> 54:52.440
to the.

54:52.440 --> 54:57.820
I think you caught cold very badly.

54:57.820 --> 54:59.950
What happened?

54:59.950 --> 55:05.270
Gavin Brown: I don’t know.

55:05.270 --> 55:14.970
Shri Mataji: I think you put your hand here.

55:14.970 --> 55:17.690
Sit down!

55:17.690 --> 55:18.690
Be careful.

55:18.690 --> 55:19.690
Hmm!

55:19.690 --> 55:20.690
Better.

55:20.690 --> 55:21.690
Somebody with cold must have come or something
you see, or the hay fever is there.

55:21.690 --> 55:23.330
Gavin Brown: Might be that.

55:23.330 --> 55:30.110
Shri Mataji: From Right Nabhi: it’s on the
right hand side the problem is.

55:30.110 --> 55:34.680
How are you?

55:34.680 --> 55:38.030
Good!

55:38.030 --> 55:58.180
Now close your eyes, close.

55:58.180 --> 56:10.270
You put your hand here, the right, and the
left there to work out the Vishuddhi.

56:10.270 --> 56:12.910
Right Nabhi also.

56:12.910 --> 56:16.860
Is it your liver coming up or what?

56:16.860 --> 56:23.860
Gavin Brown: I don’t think so.

56:23.860 --> 56:30.850
Shri Mataji: Quite a lot eh?

56:30.850 --> 56:34.350
Gavin Brown: Hmm.

56:34.350 --> 56:44.420
Shri Mataji: All right, move from the left
more, from the left.

56:44.420 --> 56:51.000
Keep your eyes shut and enjoy your Self, enjoy
your Self.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.650
Just don’t think.

56:52.650 --> 56:54.760
Just don’t think.

56:54.760 --> 57:02.220
Just enjoy your Self.

57:02.220 --> 57:07.100
Don’t think.

57:07.100 --> 57:11.990
Don’t think.

57:11.990 --> 57:14.430
Hmm!

57:14.430 --> 57:16.870
Better.

57:16.870 --> 57:26.640
Where is it Mark?

57:26.640 --> 57:31.520
Whole Left?

57:31.520 --> 57:36.400
Better now?

57:36.400 --> 57:38.840
Improving?

57:38.840 --> 57:41.290
Heart?

57:41.290 --> 57:43.730
Better.

57:43.730 --> 57:53.490
Keep your eyes shut!

57:53.490 --> 58:00.820
Enjoy your Self.

58:00.820 --> 58:07.460
You are all going down into your Self.

58:07.460 --> 58:08.810
Just allow it.

58:08.810 --> 58:10.700
Relax, relax.

58:10.700 --> 58:12.580
Just relax.

58:12.580 --> 58:15.470
Don’t think about anything just relax.

58:15.470 --> 58:20.270
You are working it out.

58:20.270 --> 58:34.160
Now just relax.

58:34.160 --> 58:59.380
Don’t think.

58:59.380 --> 59:24.600
Better now.

59:24.600 --> 59:37.210
Tremendous!

59:37.210 --> 59:49.820
Haa?

59:49.820 --> 01:00:15.040
Giving out.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:27.650
Better.

01:00:27.650 --> 01:01:05.480
Now, better now?

01:01:05.480 --> 01:02:21.790
Now are

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:23.180
you feeling?

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.350
Better?

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:26.680
Losing again?

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.090
You are losing again?

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:31.030
What?

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:35.940
Come up, come here.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.700
Sit down.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.470
Sit down.

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:51.820
See your liver comes back again: still treating
your liver patients there is it?

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.090
Come forward, come forward.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:55.270
I’ll have to put my foot on your liver.

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:57.210
Now just see how stone-like it has become.

01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:03.840
See now, what else do you expect but heat?

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.420
See?

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:26.760
That’s what it is.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:35.930
Now better?

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:49.990
Somebody’s catching on the Back Agnya.

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.990
Hmm!

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.990
Gavin Brown: It’s moving.

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.990
It’s moving now.

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.990
Shri Mataji: Better?

01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.990
Much better now.

01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.990
Sorry I have to use my feet but they are very
powerful you know.

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:59.040
For physical problems they are better than
my hands are.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:11.470
Poor things, they go on working morning till
evening!

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:26.960
Press it hard!

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:32.120
Better!

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:55.890
Still you are working with the liver patients
are they?

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.700
Doctor: Hmm.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:01.340
Shri Mataji: What do you do about them?

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.100
What treatments do you give for liver patients
in the hospitals?

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.070
Doctor: Special drugs.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.620
Shri Mataji: What drugs?

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.700
Doctor: Depends what the problem is with the
liver.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:29.250
Shri Mataji: But still what drugs normally
you use?

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:35.860
Doctor: The main things they use are for someone
who is alcoholic and they start to bleed.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.020
Shri Mataji: Alcohol?

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.680
Doctor: They have alcoholic cirrhosis and
they bleed and they vomit blood.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.850
Shri Mataji: Really?

01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:43.850
That serious?

01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:47.510
Doctor: So we have special drugs to help stop
that.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.840
Shri Mataji: Just look at this!

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.810
Despite that, nobody publishes these things.

01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:58.840
You know, the other day in a very so-called
important dinner table, there was a big argument

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:07.240
[that] was on that, in France, the pubs are
open all the time, while here they open very

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:12.150
late, so people are very unhappy that you
are not sufficiently alcoholic!

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:14.970
A big discussion is on.

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.570
Let them see these photographs!

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:23.430
Why not show them how people vomit blood and
how people do these things.

01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:29.109
It would be a good idea.

01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:30.109
And the food they eat do they?

01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:36.090
Doctor: Well, there’s so many different
problems we have with the liver.

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:42.037
Say, they are alcoholic then they have intravenous
therapy.

01:06:42.037 --> 01:06:43.037
Shri Mataji: They cannot eat the food?

01:06:43.037 --> 01:06:44.037
They vomit?

01:06:44.037 --> 01:06:45.037
Doctor: So they put special tubes down them
to stop them vomiting, and then they give

01:06:45.037 --> 01:06:45.537
them blood because they are losing so much.
