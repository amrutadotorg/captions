1984-0708 Public Program 1 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth

00:00.000 --> 00:06.892
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:07.000 --> 00:19.892
In the previous two lectures I told you how to understand the experience of truth.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.892
In the first one, we came to the conclusion that if we have to feel the truth,

00:29.000 --> 00:38.892
it’s not our only mental acceptance that it is truth, or our mental projection that it is truth,

00:39.000 --> 00:48.892
but you have to feel it on your central nervous system.

00:49.000 --> 01:02.892
In the second lecture I told you that when you feel the truth through your central nervous system

01:03.000 --> 01:13.892
in your evolutionary process, then you become something.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.892
You become, you become is the point. Is not that you think you are like this or like that,

01:22.000 --> 01:37.892
but you really become something. Like a flower becomes a fruit or an egg becomes a chick.

01:38.000 --> 01:47.892
You have to become something in your awareness, and this new awareness is the awareness of collective consciousness.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.892
Where you can feel yourself, what’s the problem with you and you can feel others, on your fingertips.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.892
This is a very good English idiom they use, on your fingertips.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.892
I mean somebody must have thought of Sahaja Yoga when they formed this I am sure.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.892
To use this, you should know it on your fingertips.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.892
Now what does that mean? We have never thought of it, we always say so, we should know them on our fingertips,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.892
but actually you feel them on your fingertips.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.892
The different centres within you and the centres in other people.

02:29.000 --> 02:39.892
As hot or cold, may be as heavy, burning; this you just feel it. You can feel it, others can feel it,

02:40.000 --> 02:48.892
children can feel it and everybody feels the same, because truth is absolute and is for everyone.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.892
Whether you have a different caste, community, race, religion, nationality,

02:57.000 --> 03:03.892
all kinds of superficial things, which divides human beings, everyone feels the same.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.892
For example, supposing you put a finger to this, (Candle flame) you are going to feel hot.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.892
Because you have a different hair style, you are not going to feel something different,

03:16.000 --> 03:23.892
it’s like that. Truth has to be that way, and that is what is the experience of truth.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.892
And once you know you have to know the truth and nothing else but the truth.

03:29.000 --> 03:38.892
When you decide in your mind and be honest about it then when you see it, it is very obvious.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.892
It has to be obvious, it cannot be secretive. It cannot be, it has to be obvious, apparent,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.892
absolutely known to your central nervous system.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.892
So you know the absolute as I told you. Like a computer you start working, you ask any questions,

04:00.000 --> 04:08.892
absolute questions and the answers come to you, as cool vibrations for yes and as hot vibrations for no

04:09.000 --> 04:16.892
and sometimes the vibrations stops to say that absolutely no.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.892
But it can be some blister sometimes a little bit, to say that it’s satanic.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.892
And you can decode it yourself and see for yourself.

04:26.000 --> 04:38.892
This is the second phase where you start knowing about others and knowing about yourself.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.892
So you become connected with the Absolute. Absolute, means there is no question about it,

04:48.000 --> 04:59.892
absolute means there is no doubt about it, absolute means it is single.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.892
Today I have to tell you about what actually happens when this force called Kundalini within you

05:10.000 --> 05:20.892
rises and gives you self-realization. Actually within your self what should happen?

05:21.000 --> 05:29.892
Nobody tells you these things, I mean, they’ll say you are to be reborn, so you have a sort of a certificate,

05:30.000 --> 05:38.892
twice born, reborn and you go about, when it’s not like that.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.892
Supposing a monkey puts a sign-board on, “I am a human being”, does he become?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.892
If we just say we are this, we are that, you are not.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.892
For example we say we are Muslims, we are Christians, we are Hindus, we are not.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.892
Because you have formed a group, you call yourself something, or something that you are not.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.892
It’s just your own idea. How are you a Hindu? How are you a Christian?

06:14.000 --> 06:21.892
What all these religions have said that you have to be born again.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.892
Every religion, Jews have in a way said it too,

06:29.000 --> 06:40.892
but the problem is that we don’t do what is told to us, we just form a group.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.892
Group can be made out of anything nonsensical like, I met some other people the other day

06:46.000 --> 06:50.892
and they told Me our group is called as Knives and Fork.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.892
I said “What’s that group?” Knives and Forks, yes very good group,

06:55.000 --> 07:02.892
so I said, “What is that?” “Because we put our knives and forks in a different way than others.”

07:03.000 --> 07:09.892
I said ” But what’s the use?” “No, we form a very strong group.” “For what?”

07:10.000 --> 07:12.892
“We can form a political party tomorrow.”

07:13.000 --> 07:16.892
I said, “All right, go ahead with this kind of a nonsense”,

07:17.000 --> 07:24.892
But it is nonsense, all this is nonsense. What is sensible is that

07:25.000 --> 07:29.892
we have to become something more than what we are. We are human beings,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.892
we have to become more knowledgeable, we have to become the knowledge.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.892
That knowledge you cannot get in the libraries or from the books.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.892
How do you grow into that knowledge is through this Kundalini awakening,

07:45.000 --> 07:49.892
through this happening that, this Kundalini rises within you

07:50.000 --> 07:57.892
and pierces through your fontanel bone area giving you the real baptism and not the artificial one.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.892
The reality again. Supposing somebody doesn’t get it, all right, so he comes back on Me,

08:06.000 --> 08:13.892
“Oh I never got it Mother”. Something wrong, he should get it, should get it.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.892
Because we cannot give you a false certificate, you cannot give yourself a false certificate.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.892
But it is very common as you see in this world, that when you listen to people who are religious,

08:32.000 --> 08:39.892
you find they are horribly fanatic, funny, stupid people.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.892
I mean if you want to hear about each one of them you should go to the opposite party.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.892
Like if you want to hear about Hindus go to Muslims.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.892
If you want to hear about the Muslims go to Jews and

08:58.000 --> 09:04.892
if you want to hear about Jews go to say Muslims or anyone, Christians, and they’ll tell you.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.892
So there’s nothing universal opinion about things.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.892
It is surprising for a person who wants to see the truth in every religion,

09:16.000 --> 09:21.892
he cannot understand why people belonging to religion, when God is only one,

09:22.000 --> 09:31.892
why there’s a fight going on. Why this world is divided by, even religious leaders are dividing the world.

09:32.000 --> 09:42.892
It is very amazing. So where is this religion? And what happens to our religion?

09:43.000 --> 09:54.892
When we get our self-realization, we become the Self, the Spirit and the Spirit is untarnishable.

09:55.000 --> 10:03.892
It’s untarnishable. You cannot cleanse the soap, can you?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.892
But the quality of Spirit is that it cleanses you. First is it cleanses you.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.892
Just like a Mother lovingly cleanses the child who has fallen somewhere in the road

10:16.000 --> 10:22.892
and cleanses the clothes and makes the child absolutely neat, tidy, clean

10:23.000 --> 10:25.892
and with great admiration looks at the child;

10:26.000 --> 10:35.892
in the same way the Spirit bathes you with it’s beautiful blessings so that you cleanse.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.892
And the second thing it does is to give you light.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.892
Now the light doesn’t mean electrical light, it doesn’t mean the light you see inside.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.892
What does this light means is your awareness itself.

10:54.000 --> 11:04.892
Your awareness itself becomes a higher awareness by which you start seeing things clear cut.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.892
Like I know somebody who came to see Me before Sahaja Yoga

11:13.000 --> 11:19.892
and he met Me after say a month, he was a changed man, I could not recognize him.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.892
So I said what has happened to him? He came to Me I asked him,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.892
”How are you?” He said “Mother I am fine.”

11:30.000 --> 11:38.892
He used to look very old and haggard and absolutely frustrated. I said “What has happened?”

11:39.000 --> 11:47.892
He said “Mother you know, when I got realisation, suddenly I felt tremendous compassion for everyone

11:48.000 --> 11:55.892
and I had an enemy that was my uncle and I hated him from the bottom of my heart,

11:56.000 --> 12:02.892
and I used to think he has killed my mother, and I could not believe that he has not killed my mother,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.892
so many people told me but still with the hatred I could not get over it.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.892
I had insulted him, he had insulted me and if somebody had given me freedom with

12:11.000 --> 12:16.892
a dagger I would have gone and killed him. I hated him from the bottom of my heart.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.892
And all the time I thought of killing him, doing this and all the nasty things I could think of.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.892
My whole mind was pre-occupied.” “So what happened?” He said,

12:30.000 --> 12:36.892
“Next day I started seeing his good points, I said no he is a very generous man.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.892
I have been nastier that he has been, suddenly I started feeling it, that feeling of love,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.892
compassion and when I said uncle, I forgive you completely,

12:50.000 --> 12:55.892
the blissfulness crawled upon me, that’s the first time I’ve felt the joy of my spirit.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.892
I had said this before also but I had never felt it,

13:00.000 --> 13:06.892
but first time when I said this I felt it and that bliss was so great and that joy was so great

13:07.000 --> 13:09.892
I said now I must have it at any cost.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.892
So next day I saw him at a race, he was a great race goer also, a very rich man.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.892
I saw him and I just embraced him. I couldn’t help it. He was surprised, he looked at me,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.892
he said come and have tea with me, and we are great friends now.”

13:30.000 --> 13:36.892
So all that wrinkle, all that horrible anger and all that has gone away

13:37.000 --> 13:42.892
and this divine, serene face was showing its beauty there.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.892
But he said “I have done this before, I’ve tried to forgive him, I told myself,

13:49.000 --> 13:53.892
I told many a times that he’s not killed my mother, I should not hate him.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.892
I tried to convince myself, but still I could not forgive, I didn’t have the power to forgive.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.892
But when I got my self-realization, suddenly the power came to me,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.892
in such a gush. I have become powerful Mother.”

14:10.000 --> 14:14.892
In the Sanskrit language it’s called the word Samarth,

14:15.000 --> 14:22.892
Samarth means powerful but actually means Sama-Artha, it means equal to your meaning.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.892
Equal to your meaning, means you become your Self. Samartha.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.892
When you become yourself, you become powerful to fight your weaknesses

14:34.000 --> 14:48.892
and you automatically do it without any trouble, spontaneously. Very easy it is to forgive.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.892
Not only this, so many things there are which you just do without any difficulty.

14:57.000 --> 15:07.892
It is very difficult before realization for a person to think that to part with your little bit of two P’s that you have,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.892
even that is sometimes difficult. You think ten times, calculate it, all right,

15:13.000 --> 15:19.892
if I give two P’s now how much will I get, three P’s or five P’s, all right

15:20.000 --> 15:29.892
if I get three P’s no good, five P’s is all right; but after realization you just give.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.892
You just give, you like to give, you love to give, you want to enjoy the giving capacity of yourself.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.892
So far the acquiring, acquisition and also the capacity to preserve,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.892
keep everything to yourself becomes a giving capacity.

15:45.000 --> 15:53.892
And as a result of that, what you find, you are filled in.

15:54.000 --> 16:07.892
Every sort of thing, every sort of material or physical or anything that is needed to make you happy

16:08.000 --> 16:13.892
just comes down. From where, how, God alone knows because it’s only God does the job,

16:14.000 --> 16:26.892
it’s God’s work. So the power to stand up against evil, against injustice,

16:27.000 --> 16:35.892
against wrong doing just changes your priorities completely

16:36.000 --> 16:44.892
and you become a powerful personality. Like Christ when He saw the prostitute,

16:45.000 --> 16:52.892
Mary Magdalene, being stoned, He saw the disciple Mary Magdalene in her.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.892
He stood up and He said, “Those who have not sinned can throw stones at Me.”

16:59.000 --> 17:04.892
That character, that strength that stood up there,

17:05.000 --> 17:11.892
and nobody could even think of throwing stones at Him.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.892
This powerful personality which is compassion, which is righteous, which is virtuous,

17:20.000 --> 17:30.892
starts shining through you. It’s not a quarrelsome dominating power in which we believe.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.892
According to us a powerful man is the one who can dominate the whole world.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.892
The power of love we have never exploited, never.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.892
All our enterprises, all our worldly affairs, political, economic, are based on hatred.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.892
The power of love in it’s purest from is the most powerful thing

17:59.000 --> 18:04.892
and that is going to emancipate the whole universe. There’s no other way out.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.892
It doesn’t mean your carnal love or your nonsensical ideas of love, it’s not, it’s pure love.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.892
The pure love is that kind where the sap rises in a tree

18:17.000 --> 18:25.892
and gives nourishment to all the parts of the tree and goes back. It’s not attached.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.892
If it gets attached to one flower, the tree will die, the flower will die.

18:32.000 --> 18:39.892
So this is the power which empowers you, nourishes you, soothes you,

18:40.000 --> 18:50.892
consoles you, relaxes you and leaves you powerful.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.892
That sort of a power is to be felt if it is the experience of truth.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.892
But we have never tried to understand love in its own truth.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.892
The reason is we were not realized people. When we are blind, we are mixed up.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.892
We can’t make out one from another but when our eyes are opened out

19:20.000 --> 19:27.892
we understand the true love. And this is what people have exploited, many of them,

19:28.000 --> 19:32.892
many so called gurus and these people who talk of God have exploited

19:33.000 --> 19:40.892
this side of love by teaching dirty things to people, debasing them, using their weaknesses.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.892
Saying that if you do this kind of a weakness, then you will reach God.

19:49.000 --> 20:02.892
Love that makes you a slave cannot be love and that is what it is, the love that is divine,

20:03.000 --> 20:10.892
is the love of God that starts flowing through you, you become the medium, as you call it,

20:11.000 --> 20:17.892
of that love. A powerful medium. But you know how to manoeuvre it.

20:18.000 --> 20:26.892
You know everything. It’s not blindly, I have seen some people, oh we are in love, you see going on like that, no.

20:27.000 --> 20:36.892
You know everyone. You know ins and outs of everyone and of yourself also.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.892
I have seen many people coming to Me and saying, “Mother please save me from this Agnya.”

20:43.000 --> 20:48.892
Now in our language it is this Agnya, but actually it means ego.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.892
You can see your ego clearly once you get realization and we say oh God what is this?

20:55.000 --> 21:01.892
That’s not me, I am not ego, oh that’s not me, I am the Self, I am the Spirit.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.892
So this separation takes place within yourself, with your own understanding that,

21:10.000 --> 21:20.892
you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this superego but you are the spirit.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.892
And the more you grow into it, a beautiful personality of a character, which is not a character,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.892
sometimes people think if you are very meek, is he compromising,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.892
such a character will never compromise, is a terrific character.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.892
It would never compromise with anything that is not the truth. It cannot by temperament.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.892
But is very kind and compassionate, forgiving.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.892
Gives lots of chances because there’s that inner urge to save others, to save others,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.892
to help others, to get them to the right thing.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.892
It’s like people who are standing on the brink of a disaster,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.892
or people who are on the bank and see the people getting drowned and trying to pull them out

22:16.000 --> 22:24.892
with all their effort. But they don’t want to compromise as to jump or to leave the banks that they have got.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.892
Such a character you develop then and this character is felt by everyone.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.892
I have known many Sahaja Yogis first who came to Sahaja Yoga,

22:39.000 --> 22:45.892
their own family people were angry. Now you are following another Guru,

22:46.000 --> 22:54.892
this is another cult, this is that. But then they found out that they are giving no money, nothing,

22:55.000 --> 23:03.892
and they are flowering. In every way they are beautiful, they are becoming better and better people.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.892
Righteous and virtuous people, powerful people of great character

23:11.000 --> 23:15.892
and they are amazed you know. How do they become?

23:16.000 --> 23:23.892
And they become very intelligent, they don’t do any stupid things, they just don’t do it.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.892
Even a little child knows it’s stupid. They don’t do stupid things.

23:30.000 --> 23:39.892
They don’t do nonsensical things. They are dignified and they don’t take to cheap entertainments.

23:40.000 --> 23:49.892
The depth that you feel in the poets, in the great musicians, becomes their own nature.

23:50.000 --> 24:02.892
When they talk, when they walk, any rapport with them, you can feel the depth of their spirit.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.892
They become very knowledgeable suddenly. As I told you last time these journalists asked Me

24:09.000 --> 24:12.892
“Mother have you got all scholars?” I said “Scholars, what.”

24:13.000 --> 24:17.892
“All scholars are Sahaja Yogis,” I said “No, at the most one percent may be,

24:18.000 --> 24:24.892
who have been great headaches to me, the rest of them are simple people.”

24:25.000 --> 24:32.892
Simple people are the best and this is what is true,

24:33.000 --> 24:42.892
that those who get realization start feeling the knowledge which is absolute.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.892
Seeing the knowledge, knowing the knowledge.

24:47.000 --> 24:55.892
Like if you see, say, this pillar, you just look at it, you say, oh very nicely done painted this,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.892
somebody might say it should not have been this color, that color.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.892
But a Sahaja Yogi doesn’t see this pillar as to how aesthetically it is and all that,

25:07.000 --> 25:15.892
but immediately he’ll say it’s beautiful. You’ll say why? It gives vibrations.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.892
The whole aesthetics are worked out through vibrations.

25:21.000 --> 25:29.892
All the beautiful things, as I told you last time, of the world have vibrations.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.892
Real beautiful things have vibrations. Like Mona Lisa I told you the other day,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.892
if you go and feel her vibrations, she has vibrations.

25:39.000 --> 25:50.892
Now the one who has made her has put his joy into her and she emits vibrations.

25:51.000 --> 26:02.892
And that is the thing that gives joy to you because you are at a level where you can feel those vibrations.

26:03.000 --> 26:12.892
You start feeling the physical side of yours, you understand you have a physical problem.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.892
Immediately you know you have a physical problem, you know where it is,

26:16.000 --> 26:20.892
how to correct it, how to cure it. I have seen many people who come to me,

26:21.000 --> 26:26.892
Mother cure my cancer, but they don’t come to Me before they get cancer.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.892
If they had come they would never have got it, but they had no time, at that time they had no time.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.892
But when they get cancer I have no time either. It happens always.

26:42.000 --> 26:51.892
Of course they are to be helped, cured, but why not come as a prevention to all those diseases

26:52.000 --> 27:10.892
which has no meaning. It is unnecessarily so much accepted that health is first of all.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.892
Then there is nothing to worry about health if you come to Sahaja Yoga,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.892
you don’t need any doctor, sorry for the doctors, I am sorry.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.892
And this is what it is to be understood that physically you feel absolutely fit.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.892
You look fit absolutely. You look marvellous.

27:41.000 --> 27:56.892
Then when you start expanding yourself you start feeling your own mind.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.892
The peace, the bliss of your own mind.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.892
Many a times you’ll find there is no thought but the joy is just bursting in

28:08.000 --> 28:15.892
and you just think why it has happened. Suddenly, how do I get this?

28:16.000 --> 28:28.892
Gradually the state of joy starts increasing in its frequency and you become joy.

28:29.000 --> 28:37.892
That is, one has to achieve, to become the joy is important.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.892
And once you become that joy it’s not a duality, it’s not a duality.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.892
It’s not a thing in which you feel the happiness and unhappiness but you feel the joy.

28:53.000 --> 29:03.892
Joy is a witness, it’s a kind of a power of a witness which sees a drama,

29:04.000 --> 29:12.892
by seeing the drama, whether tragedy or comedy, it’s at a point where it is just a witness and enjoying it.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.892
In the same way you’ll see so called comedies and tragedies of your life

29:18.000 --> 29:24.892
and the futility of your nonsensical endeavours and you’ll laugh at it, oh that’s it, that’s me.

29:25.000 --> 29:32.892
For example in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare has tried to show the futility of all those egos.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.892
According to Indian standards he was Avadhotta, as they call it, a person who was realised

29:40.000 --> 29:46.892
and was a very evolved personality. And if you want to see how Romeo should get his realization

29:47.000 --> 29:51.892
and how he should feel that after all that happened he should laugh loudly.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.892
She gets realisation, oh what a fool a stupid thing I was.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.892
Shakespeare did not show him getting realization he kept it for us Sahaja Yogis to see it,

30:07.000 --> 30:12.892
but should have seen to it that Romeo laughs at himself and makes fun of himself,

30:13.000 --> 30:19.892
oh stupid Mr. Romeo, now you better settle down.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.892
But he showed and very cleverly if you see in all his Macbeth or any of his dramas

30:27.000 --> 30:31.892
that he has tried to show the futility of our ego, our enterprises,

30:32.000 --> 30:39.892
we think that is very important in life.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.892
I would say there are so many great writers in English language,

30:43.000 --> 30:46.892
which I cannot name them in a series, but I have read them.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.892
Somerset Maugham, I would say was another one. I was very much impressed by his writings

30:53.000 --> 30:58.892
and read most of his novels because he was very much there.

30:59.000 --> 31:06.892
Cronin for example is another one I would say who wrote Citadel was another great person who

31:07.000 --> 31:16.892
could see the drama of stupidity. Leave alone your great poets like William Blake and all those.

31:17.000 --> 31:26.892
But all that was to show that there is a higher being you see, which sees all this,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.892
and giving you a drama of yourself, projecting it through you.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.892
That this is what you are, you see, see yourself.

31:37.000 --> 31:48.892
That’s what they did and despite everything we’re lost. We are lost quite a lot.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.892
We have to become the same like Shakespeare to see the drama,

31:56.000 --> 32:00.892
like Somerset Maugham, we have to become the same.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.892
To see the drama, we may not write a book, doesn’t matter,

32:04.000 --> 32:10.892
but the capacity to see the drama, that’s what we develop.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.892
We need not write, we may not have the flare of a pen to write but we see it the same way as they see it

32:18.000 --> 32:24.892
and that’s the mental capacity to which we rise with self-realization.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.892
I have seen very stupid people absolutely calling themselves gurus,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.892
you look at them and you don’t know what to say, you see.

32:33.000 --> 32:40.892
You have to look at stupider persons to stupider, that person, what you say, stupidest person,

32:41.000 --> 32:45.892
in the presence of such a person, because he looks at you, you see,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.892
and you understand he is stupid and you don’t know what to do.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.892
And you get frightened of such a person you know and you don’t want to hurt his feelings you see,

32:57.000 --> 33:02.892
so you look the greater stupid person and then he gives you a big lecture,

33:03.000 --> 33:09.892
on something very stupid. But then you find that person you see,

33:10.000 --> 33:16.892
big newspapers you see like Times, publishing such a stupid man there.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.892
Just imagine, this is what we have done to Shakespeare, to all our great writers and everyone,

33:24.000 --> 33:29.892
we have reached that state that we cannot even see the stupidity.

33:36.000 --> 33:43.892
Our brain is stunned because we have been asking for sensations,

33:44.000 --> 33:49.892
with all these electrical sensations in the brain we are stunned.

33:50.000 --> 34:01.892
Which opens out, which completely opens out and you start seeing, through and through,

34:02.000 --> 34:10.892
the mockery of all this kind of seriousness and the hypocrisy

34:11.000 --> 34:19.892
and the way people who are stupid try to give you stupid ideas.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.892
And once you are realised you laugh at yourself,

34:23.000 --> 34:29.892
oh God I was so stupid, that’s what should happen.

34:30.000 --> 34:39.892
If that does not happen your self-realization has no meaning, it has no meaning.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.892
The righteousness and the virtues become part and parcel of your being.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.892
It’s not that you have to be told anything, you just shouldn’t do it.

34:51.000 --> 34:58.892
It’s beyond your self respect because you respect your Self, you respect your Spirit.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.892
How can you do such a thing? You cannot despise yourself can you?

35:07.000 --> 35:12.892
You just become virtuous. You may be kind to others even if they are not virtuous,

35:13.000 --> 35:18.892
you can be nice to them, you can forgive them but as far as you are concerned there is no compromise.

35:19.000 --> 35:26.892
And you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your magnanimity, you enjoy your generosity.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.892
People will tell you, stupid fool, you go on distributing things what are you doing?

35:31.000 --> 35:40.892
And you laugh at them. As Lao Tse said, somebody told Me this saying about Lao Tse,

35:41.000 --> 35:46.892
another great incarnation of the primordial master,

35:47.000 --> 35:54.892
that when a wise sees the way, he respects it and says this is the way.

35:55.000 --> 36:03.892
That’s the sign of a wise man and a mediocre who is half way this way and that way

36:04.000 --> 36:10.892
when he sees the way he waits for others to go into it,

36:11.000 --> 36:17.892
and when the stupid sees the way he laughs.

36:18.000 --> 36:26.892
But when the wise sees the stupid in himself he laughs.

36:27.000 --> 36:41.892
So that power of wisdom starts shinning through you, you become a wise, righteous, virtuous man.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.892
And such a balance you develop. I have known people who are honest, you see, so called,

36:49.000 --> 36:54.892
now they go to such an extreme of honesty, that for honesty’s sake they’ll kill their father,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.892
kill their mother, kill everyone.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.892
But such a balanced and integrated person you become

37:04.000 --> 37:12.892
that whatever you do is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.892
In Sanskrit the word is Haitha [BEST GUESS],

37:16.000 --> 37:22.892
what ever is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others you do it.

37:23.000 --> 37:31.892
And that is the right thing to do, and that’s how you become a righteous personality.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.892
That’s the religion within you that gets awakened. Nobody has to tell you your religion,

37:40.000 --> 37:46.892
you yourself become your own master, your own Guru, and by which you determine yourself,

37:47.000 --> 37:58.892
now Mr. you can’t do this. No you can’t. So you become your own police commissioner.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.892
You don’t need any outsider to tell you.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.892
You are on your own guard because if you do something like that your vibrations will disappear

38:09.000 --> 38:15.892
and then you don’t like it, don’t like it. Then you feel uneasy.

38:16.000 --> 38:24.892
Nobody has to have you as a Guru, there’s no need you become your own Guru, is the best way.

38:25.000 --> 38:37.892
And that’s how you solve the problem of becoming better by others,

38:38.000 --> 38:49.892
is very difficult but yourself becoming better, by your own understanding and urges,

38:50.000 --> 38:59.892
it’s a thousand fold happier and strong.

39:00.000 --> 39:12.892
So the third thing that happens to you, that you become religious, you become the Guru, yourself.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.892
Nobody has to tell you because there is a natural valency of ten within you

39:19.000 --> 39:24.892
which starts balancing you, and you become one and enjoy that balance.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.892
As you enjoy a balance of colors in a beautiful photograph,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.892
in the same way you enjoy the balance within yourself. You enjoy your personality,

39:34.000 --> 39:40.892
you enjoy your being and you enjoy to be the Self.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.892
And those who are on the same level, you just enjoy each other.

39:46.000 --> 39:54.892
This is the first time you enjoy other human being, as if you are enjoying a flower.

39:55.000 --> 40:05.892
The fragrance of that personality is spiritual fragrance, is so beautiful and attractive.

40:06.000 --> 40:17.892
Without any lust and greed in it but just enjoying the company is real perfect bliss.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.892
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.892
Now, again today, I would like you to ask Me some questions.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.892
There is going to be the fourth lecture, that they will announce.

40:33.000 --> 40:41.892
I hope you will make it a point to come and complete the series of lectures we have been having.

40:54.000 --> 41:09.892
Q1. [INAUDIBLE]

41:10.000 --> 41:13.892
A1. It’s true. It has been told that you must have a Guru.

41:14.000 --> 41:22.892
But it’s said that it has to be a Satguru. Anybody you see, mostly,

41:23.000 --> 41:28.892
the gurus who are in the market today. You cannot be in the market,

41:29.000 --> 41:37.892
and those who are in the market are actually, are nowhere near God.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.892
They have to be Satguru, means he has to be a realized soul of a very high degree.

41:48.000 --> 41:54.892
Now you better become your own Guru. And then you will know that you are a Satguru.

41:55.000 --> 42:01.892
I am the Mother, I am not a Guru. And what is Mother’s desire is? You had a mother also.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.892
Whatever I have, you better have it. That’s all.

42:08.000 --> 42:16.892
So as you have come to Mother, now you don’t ask for any guru, you better become yourself a Guru. All right?

42:17.000 --> 42:26.892
Q2. [INAUDIBLE]

42:27.000 --> 42:34.892
A2. No. You see, you must know that the Kundalini awakening itself, breaking through and all that,

42:35.000 --> 42:40.892
is a big happening. A key event of evolution, the epitome of it, as you know,

42:41.000 --> 42:48.892
as an Indian you know how Sakshatkar is such a big thing. But to achieve that,

42:49.000 --> 42:53.892
there must be a big machinery within us. Like you see the electrical bulb here, or a light here,

42:54.000 --> 43:02.892
you know there is a history behind it, and it is a big mechanism and organization that has worked it out.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.892
In the same way to achieve this there’s a big organization.

43:08.000 --> 43:17.892
So, when you become realized, that will happen very soon to you.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.892
Means you’ll feel the cool breeze coming out of the Brahmarandra, through your fontanel bone area.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.892
But then to develop it, you have to understand, deeper, the mechanism.

43:29.000 --> 43:38.892
Then the mantras are placed according to the deities of these seven chakras.

43:39.000 --> 43:48.892
Now if the Kundalini is stopping, or is weak at a point, any one of these chakras,

43:49.000 --> 43:53.892
then you have to say a particular mantra for that. Which will be told to you,

43:54.000 --> 43:59.892
which you can learn very easily. And you will know also about all the mantras that are to be said.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.892
Like, you see, many gurus I have seen give away one mantra. Like they say Ram.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.892
How can that be? You see, there are seven chakras, and if you take Ram,

44:14.000 --> 44:17.892
he’s on the right side of the heart chakra, means [UNKNOWN SANSKRIT WORD].

44:18.000 --> 44:21.892
Now, if you are taking the name of Rama, why, why Rama’s name?

44:22.000 --> 44:28.892
Ask a question to him, you must ask a question. Why Rama’s name, why not Krishna’s?

44:29.000 --> 44:34.892
Why not Jesus? The reason is, if he’s a Satguru he’ll tell you,

44:35.000 --> 44:42.892
that you have a problem with your right heart. But all of them here, those who are realization souls,

44:43.000 --> 44:47.892
can tell you where is the problem. And you will also tell tomorrow.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.892
Q3. [INAUDIBLE]

44:50.000 --> 44:55.892
A3. No, it’s not. There are seven mantras actually. Basically you must know about seven mantras.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.892
But gradually, you pick it up in no time, because immediately you know where the problem is,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.892
and immediately you say the mantra. It’s not very difficult, it’s very simple.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.892
It is woven in a pattern and it’s very simple to say those mantras.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.892
But it works out so spontaneously, I mean, these are all people who are English

45:14.000 --> 45:20.892
and Greeks and this and that, and they don’t know. Even, we can say mantras in English language now.

45:21.000 --> 45:31.892
That’s an advancement I think. That all the deities can understand English language as well.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.892
So you can say it in Sanskrit or in English, it’s all right, it works out.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.892
And, once you know it, it’s so easy to say it, easy to understand. It’s not a problem at all.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.892
But first of all you should get your realization, that’s first thing.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.892
That is you should break through, you see, the seed must break. [INAUDIBLE], its primule must break.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.892
Then the second thing is to see that it sustains itself above the ground.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.892
Then it is to be maintained and developed until you become a tree.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.892
But it’s very simple, it’s not difficult.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.892
Q4. [INAUDIBLE]

46:12.000 --> 46:17.892
A4. When you get your realization you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area

46:18.000 --> 46:22.892
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands. Then you can ask a question,

46:23.000 --> 46:27.892
is this the breeze of the Adi Shakti? Is this the Chaitanya Lahari of the Adi Shakti?

46:28.000 --> 46:32.892
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti actually.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.892
Nobody has explained to them, they don’t know. I mean, they asked the Archbishop of Canterbury

46:39.000 --> 46:42.892
about Holy Ghost, he said “I’m agnostic,” can you imagine?

46:43.000 --> 46:47.892
Yes, he answered. I mean, if he’s agnostic this Robin Day asked him

46:48.000 --> 46:52.892
“So what are you doing here?” So he said “I’m doing my job.” So Robin Day said

46:53.000 --> 46:59.892
“Yes” because he also does the job. He understood it. [HINDI].

47:00.000 --> 47:04.892
Now the problem is that when you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.892
you might find that after some time it goes away then comes. See, depends on.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.892
Some people have a express train, as we call it.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.892
But some of them have some bogeys, which go up and down. It doesn’t matter.

47:20.000 --> 47:27.892
We should not frustrate on that point, it works out. One should not get unhappy about it.

47:28.000 --> 47:41.892
Q5. [INAUDIBLE]

47:42.000 --> 47:51.892
A5. Subconscious. Of course, I mean the same. I am the Self, I am the Spirit, yes.

47:52.000 --> 47:59.892
Like, I’ll tell you, in the bible, Christ clearly said it, very clearly, we don’t read bible that way,

48:00.000 --> 48:05.892
that’s why. That Nicodemus, you see, He told Nicodemus that you are to be born again.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.892
So, Nicodemus said that does that mean that I should enter into the womb of my mother.

48:12.000 --> 48:19.892
He said no, that is flesh, and the flesh is born out of, whatever is born out of flesh is flesh.

48:20.000 --> 48:27.892
You are to be born of your Spirit. And whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit He said.

48:28.000 --> 48:39.892
But how many people follow that? That’s the consciousness I’m talking of, the real Selfhood.

48:40.000 --> 48:48.892
What we do, in the churches, or in our Indian, any one of the religions that we have.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.892
We put the water on the head, now you are baptized, you are a Christian.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.892
For a Hindu they put a string, now you are a Brahmin, without knowing a word about Brahma.

48:58.000 --> 49:04.892
[INAUDIBLE]. So now, there is reality.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.892
All these people didn’t tell us lies you see, never told us lies.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.892
But the truth is always covered by the intellectuals, by the intelligent people on one side

49:18.000 --> 49:22.892
and by the fanatics on the other side, and that’s why the problem comes in.

49:23.000 --> 49:34.892
Q6. [INAUDIBLE]

49:35.000 --> 49:39.892
A6. You see, because, what happens that intellectuals rationalize it.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.892
They say whatever we see, we see the science, so we don’t want to believe.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.892
Now recently there has been a controversy about Christ miracles, isn’t it.

49:48.000 --> 49:58.892
There, lets take this thing very recently, there’s a controversy about Christ’s being born of a virgin.

49:59.000 --> 50:04.892
He was born of a virgin, no doubt, but how can you convince an intellectual you see,

50:05.000 --> 50:09.892
because He cannot be born of a virgin. But He was born.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.892
All these miracles are absolute truth, no doubt.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.892
So the problem is they want to see through science. Now science is analytical,

50:17.000 --> 50:23.892
it is not does the synthesis. Science deals with the dead.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.892
It deadens everything, it analyzes, and whatever you see you think it’s the truth, no,

50:28.000 --> 50:33.892
but it’s just a part of the truth. Now why do they accept?

50:34.000 --> 50:40.892
See now, big challenge, is intellectual. This was Mr Paul, who came in.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.892
When I was a child I asked My father, who is this Paul?

50:46.000 --> 50:52.892
My father, being a very great realized soul himself, he said, he was another mad man.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.892
And this Paul had never seen Christ. What we call, he had a supraconscious,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.892
a kind of a [CONDITION or POSITION?], he got blind and all that.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.892
And then he became, he was a horrible man, he killed so many Jews,

51:07.000 --> 51:10.892
he killed the young boys for [STEALING?] you know he did all sorts of things and then suddenly,

51:11.000 --> 51:16.892
he becomes a big Christian. Because he saw some sort of a political thing in that.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.892
So what does he say, he doesn’t talk of Christ as He was, he talks of a Christ

51:22.000 --> 51:26.892
which was the church Christ, the Christ of the church.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.892
Now, Christ of the church has nothing to do with real Christ, has nothing to do.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.892
So now, because they have to accept, the churches have to accept Paul,

51:38.000 --> 51:43.892
they cannot accept Christ. It’s a good idea. Either accept Christ, or accept,

51:44.000 --> 51:47.892
this is what happens with intellectuals. Even in India it has happened.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.892
I’ll tell you when, when Adi Shankaracharya, he wrote a book called Viviketurya.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.892
It’s a great treatise. About Athvaida [BEST GUESS] he said that God is everything,

52:01.000 --> 52:08.892
Brahma is everything. A beautiful treatise he wrote. So there was a fellow called Vishra,

52:09.000 --> 52:13.892
Mandan Vishra [BEST GUESS], is a great learned man, another intellectual,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.892
he came to argue with him. And he argued and argued and argued,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.892
you see with argument where do you reach? You cannot by arguing give realization to somebody.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.892
And he said, “Why don’t you take your realization?” But he argued,

52:27.000 --> 52:30.892
he said “You defeat me.” He said “I don’t want to defeat you I want to give you realization,

52:31.000 --> 52:35.892
why don’t you take your realization?” He would not take the realization.

52:36.000 --> 52:43.892
So, the intellectual, you see, tortured his life. He was so fed up, Adi Shankaracharya.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.892
The book he wrote was Saundarya Lahiri, if you ever happen to read it,

52:48.000 --> 52:53.892
it’s nothing but the praise of the Mother, throughout. He said this is how [SANSKRIT]

52:54.000 --> 52:56.892
not by yoga by Sankara [BEST GUESS] by discussion, it’s only through Mother’s grace

52:57.000 --> 53:02.892
you are going to get realization [INAUDIBLE].

53:03.000 --> 53:09.892
So the intellectuals, you see, want to derive a pleasure of an intellectual feat out of most if it.

53:10.000 --> 53:18.892
It’s not the real that they are seeking. They read, a lot, achieve nothing.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.892
I have known people who are very learned, who have written many books

53:22.000 --> 53:30.892
and they are so horribly immoral within their private life you can’t believe it that they could be philosophers.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.892
And you don’t understand, how can you be, why are you so hypocritical? But they are.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.892
Because they are not realized souls. And an ordinary person, you find a realized soul.

53:43.000 --> 53:50.892
Just uneducated. That’s why Kabira has said Pari Pari Pundita Mura Kabai,

53:51.000 --> 54:00.892
by reading too much you learned have become stupid. But I don’t say all learned are stupid.

54:01.000 --> 54:08.892
No. But learning should reach that supreme power of intelligence, which is pure intelligence.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.892
Then obviously you see the thing and you accept if you are honest as I said in the beginning.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.892
You must have that pure intelligence to see, God is there.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.892
He’s above everything, he’s above your intelligence, above your thoughts.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.892
You have to feel him first, you have to rise. That is the transformation, if you cannot achieve,

54:30.000 --> 54:37.892
then how can I talk to you? If a person is blind,

54:38.000 --> 54:44.892
what’s the use of talking about colors to a blind person, what does he understand?

54:45.000 --> 54:50.892
He can’t even see whether I’m smiling or laughing or if I’m crying. What can you talk?

54:51.000 --> 54:58.892
So the eyes must be open, and these eyes which I’m talking of are above your thought.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.892
You cannot by your projection get it.

55:03.000 --> 55:11.892
It has to come to you. It’s a grace. Ashedvard [BEST GUESS].

55:12.000 --> 55:19.892
Q7. [INAUDIBLE]

55:20.000 --> 55:25.892
A7. No You see what I would suggest that what happens that once you get your realisation

55:26.000 --> 55:31.892
then I have seen a person who has developed the intellect,

55:32.000 --> 55:37.892
understands it in an intellectual way what realization is

55:38.000 --> 55:45.892
and a person who is not supposed to be so intelligent starts talking like saints.

55:46.000 --> 55:51.892
I had gone to a village in India and there was a person who was, I was going on a bullock cart,

55:52.000 --> 55:55.892
he was driving Me and I asked him when he did you get your realization

55:56.000 --> 56:00.892
and then he started talking to Me. I said “Kabira is driving Me or what?”

56:01.000 --> 56:08.892
How is he talking like this?” The truth, tremendous, what intelligence.

56:09.000 --> 56:15.892
How much Christ studied in what university?

56:16.000 --> 56:23.892
So we should not misunderstand intelligence I mean the divine intelligence,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.892
that’s a very different thing.

56:27.000 --> 56:43.012
Q8. [INAUDIBLE]

56:43.072 --> 56:49.964
A8. You are, all the time, if you, Shaktipad [BEST GUESS] is the word they use it,

56:50.072 --> 56:55.964
Shaktipad you see, but it is very much misused. Shaktipad means people start dancing like mad,

56:56.072 --> 57:00.964
they start shouting screaming how can that be Shaktipad? That’s madness, that’s possession,

57:01.072 --> 57:08.964
you get possessed. Shaktipad means if somebody is a Shakti,

57:09.072 --> 57:13.964
you see the Shakti of that person enters into your being and invites your Kundalini

57:14.072 --> 57:16.964
so the Kundalini rises. That’s what actually it is

57:17.072 --> 57:21.964
and then the Kundalini rises and makes you a beautiful person

57:22.072 --> 57:25.964
it doesn’t make you a mad person no how can it be?

57:26.072 --> 57:30.964
Just imagine now after evolving yourself from amoeba and all the donkeys

57:31.072 --> 57:39.964
and all the monkeys and what else, oh, cockroaches are you going to become a mad person?

57:40.072 --> 57:44.964
Or a frog, jumping like that.

57:45.072 --> 57:49.964
So this is very much, that’s why I don’t use very much Shaktipad power because these days

57:50.072 --> 57:56.964
every Dick, Tom and Harry is using you see. Shaktipad that’s not what I mean.

57:57.072 --> 57:59.964
Shaktipad means if somebody has Shakti it just works.

58:00.072 --> 58:05.964
You don’t go and put it in the head of that person, it just flows, all right?

58:06.072 --> 58:12.964
But it was used in Patanjali’s day in that way but who reads Patanjali? Nobody reads I think

58:13.072 --> 58:17.964
nobody reads and talks about it. What they talk is some sort of a head standing

58:18.072 --> 58:22.964
some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE SHEERSH] asana that’s all. I mean that’s we, we, we, part of it.

58:23.072 --> 58:28.964
Nobody reads him I mean if you read it, I mean, [INAUDIBLE] you see what he has written is

58:29.072 --> 58:34.964
that’s what I am doing. I am quite surprised how people talk about this thing.

58:35.072 --> 58:41.964
What he says you achieve [SANSKRIT] means you become effortless

58:42.072 --> 58:46.964
first [SANSKRIT] you become without thoughtless,

58:47.072 --> 58:54.964
then the third thing he says you become complete negation of thought, [SANSKRIT].

58:55.072 --> 59:00.681
But here it is they are all jumping, talking big, this, that, how can that be?

59:00.901 --> 59:06.793
Meditation means jumping in the air, how can it be? [HINDI]

59:06.901 --> 59:11.793
Indians understand thank God, Indians are that way you see, safe.

59:11.901 --> 59:15.793
But there should be seeking in India. You see these people are seeking

59:15.901 --> 59:20.793
and striving and they are the ones who want it, I must tell you very frankly

59:20.901 --> 59:26.793
they are the people who really are nicely seeking, in England I am saying not in India.

59:26.901 --> 59:37.793
But Indians are not seeking that, but they have one great thing in them is that they know what is reality.

59:37.901 --> 59:42.793
They understand. You see like some of the people who went to a Guru,

59:42.901 --> 59:49.793
I must tell you, and he gave them a mantra for which he charged £300 in secret, in the ears,

59:49.901 --> 01:00:00.793
nobody to be told. And the mantra was “Tinga”. “Tinga” and they told Me in the ear

01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:08.793
and I couldn’t help laughing, “Tinga” means showing like this to someone.

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:12.793
And he used to giggle at people because they were all so stupid, poor things,

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.793
but they were seekers, real seekers, you know,

01:00:15.901 --> 01:00:24.793
of such high quality and this fellow who told Me was a barrister can you imagine?

01:00:24.901 --> 01:00:40.793
Q9. [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:40.901 --> 01:00:45.793
A9. Yes, you are part, you are part of the whole. You are part and parcel of the whole.

01:00:45.901 --> 01:00:49.793
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm,

01:00:49.901 --> 01:00:55.793
as we say in Sanskrit is Virata, you become part and parcel of that Virata.

01:00:55.901 --> 01:01:12.793
Q10. [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:17.793
A10. No, no, no. [INAUDIBLE] Correct.

01:01:17.901 --> 01:01:26.793
See it may look like that because the myth of responsibility drops out.

01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:33.793
Supposing, this wire thinks that it is responsible for what I am speaking,

01:01:33.901 --> 01:01:41.793
does it become more efficient? Say, what responsibility we have is like this.

01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:47.793
When we are going by a plane, question is very good, I have seen it. I mean actually,

01:01:47.901 --> 01:01:53.793
it must be understood in its full context it’s correct that when you think it is the responsibility of God

01:01:53.901 --> 01:01:56.793
you see, then you become irresponsible.

01:01:56.901 --> 01:02:01.793
On the contrary, you become an instrument into his hands you see.

01:02:01.901 --> 01:02:07.793
But you don’t think that you are doing it yourself, like you are sitting in the play.

01:02:07.901 --> 01:02:10.793
I give this example many a times because I have seen this happen.

01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:15.793
Some villagers never knew how to go by plane so they were told not to take too much luggage.

01:02:15.901 --> 01:02:19.793
They sat in the plane and put all their luggage on their heads.

01:02:19.901 --> 01:02:24.793
Carrying the responsibility of the plane, saying that we have to carry the load

01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:29.793
because we don’t want the plane to carry all our loads you see.

01:02:29.901 --> 01:02:34.793
So that myth drops out, that myth drops out.

01:02:34.901 --> 01:02:37.793
But you become a very efficient person

01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:43.793
because the energy that’s divine starts dynamically working, manifesting.

01:02:43.901 --> 01:02:47.793
You become a dynamic person, you can do a thousand and one things

01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:51.793
which you have never done before, because you have become a perfect instrument.

01:02:51.901 --> 01:03:01.793
You are not perfect as long as you think you are doing it, you see My point?

01:03:01.901 --> 01:03:15.793
All of them, those who are realised souls, and you will be too.

01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:19.793
What work are they doing, is spiritually they are doing a lot of work, now,

01:03:19.901 --> 01:03:25.793
that’s another side when you’ll come to Sahaja Yoga we’ll tell you what work they are doing.

01:03:25.901 --> 01:03:30.793
You see what work you want us to do may not be the work that we are doing

01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:35.793
but we are transforming people. We are saving people from cancers and so many diseases,

01:03:35.901 --> 01:03:40.793
we are transforming them, we are changing them so much that they have given up drugs.

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:46.793
So many people have given up alcohol, all these bad habits have dropped out.

01:03:46.901 --> 01:03:51.793
So many people are cured of so many diseases, so many diseases we have cured already,

01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:57.793
when you come to us we will let you know as to what substantial work it is. all right?

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:03.793
Starvation of course, our starvation. Why people are starving also

01:04:03.901 --> 01:04:10.793
because I think people who drink are starving because they waste their money in drink.

01:04:10.901 --> 01:04:13.793
If they haven’t, if they have money why should they drink?

01:04:13.901 --> 01:04:17.793
If they don’t have money why should they drink? But most of the people starve themselves

01:04:17.901 --> 01:04:22.793
because they spend all their money, in UK I am saying, not in India, India is a different thing.

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:29.793
But in India people who have got realization are blessed they don’t starve anymore.

01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:42.131
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:42.241 --> 01:04:46.790
They don’t need anything, it is said that Yoga Kshema Wiam Miam,

01:04:46.901 --> 01:04:53.793
first you get your yoga, your union with God and then I will bless you. Kshema.

01:04:53.901 --> 01:04:57.793
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:57.901 --> 01:05:01.793
Yes, yes, of course, of course you can pay your rates, everything,

01:05:01.901 --> 01:05:06.793
but you just come and see before. This is the intellectual side, come inside and see,

01:05:06.901 --> 01:05:12.793
whether it works out or not. Why not see? Don’t argue for arguments sake, it works out.

01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:19.793
There’s somebody sitting behind you who has, in his life it has worked out, just behind.

01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:25.793
In many lives it has worked out but you come and see for yourself what miracles it has, all right?

01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:29.793
You come and see all previous things just drop off.

01:05:29.901 --> 01:05:34.793
Come and see how God is blissful after all the blessings come from God.

01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:39.793
But we don’t want to do anything for God and why not God look after us,

01:05:39.901 --> 01:05:48.793
what have you done for God so far. Can I ask a question?

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:58.793
Everyone has right to ask a question to Me, I better ask you all. What have you done for God?

01:05:58.901 --> 01:06:15.793
Just surrender it. [INAUDIBLE] You are afraid? [INAUDIBLE] Afraid of God? [INAUDIBLE] Pray?

01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:22.793
But what we pray to God is “Give me my food. Give me a job.

01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:35.793
God get me this. Let me win this war. Let’s kill my enemies” I know all those prayers.

01:06:53.901 --> 01:07:00.793
Q11. [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:00.901 --> 01:07:07.793
A11. First you get connected all right. First let us get connected then you will know.

01:07:07.901 --> 01:07:12.793
Then you will know what He wants and what He does.

01:07:12.901 --> 01:07:18.793
Then you will know He is very kind man, very kind,

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:24.793
extremely forgiving that the way He has forgiven us for whatever we have done.

01:07:24.901 --> 01:07:27.793
But don’t feel guilty for it, that’s one thing I didn’t want to start,

01:07:27.901 --> 01:07:31.793
because you see that’s one trouble you all have is to feel guilty and I don’t want you to feel guilty

01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:34.793
because realization doesn’t work out.

01:07:34.901 --> 01:07:45.793
Don’t feel guilty it’s all right. We’ll have it next time madam, is it something important?

01:07:45.901 --> 01:08:12.793
Q12. [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:12.901 --> 01:08:15.793
A12. Talk. Talking is not the thing,

01:08:15.901 --> 01:08:21.793
you see what I would say you should see the way they talk has nothing to do,

01:08:21.901 --> 01:08:25.793
what you have to see, what have you achieved yourself.

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:30.793
Whatever people may talk is they might be talking because they are possessed, that’s all.

01:08:30.901 --> 01:08:39.793
If somebody talks big be careful, be careful, the one who does, isn’t.

01:08:39.901 --> 01:08:44.793
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head is the point I said that nobody can do,

01:08:44.901 --> 01:08:47.793
can anybody do that?

01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:59.793
Those who talk can be good actors at the most, at the worst they are possessed. [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:59.901 --> 01:09:10.793
Q13. [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:10.901 --> 01:09:14.793
A13. Your married life improves immensely.

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:21.793
Because you will learn later on there is a centre for it and you understand your married life as a bliss,

01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:27.793
it’s absolutely pure blessings to married people. Actually you will be surprised

01:09:27.901 --> 01:09:30.793
we can’t give realization to people who are not married, in the sense

01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:38.793
who are going to marry is all right. But those who are against marriage we can’t give realization

01:09:38.901 --> 01:09:41.793
because they are a little imbalanced.

01:09:41.901 --> 01:09:50.793
I think the one we had you see, we couldn’t give realization, I hope he’s not here.

01:09:50.901 --> 01:09:55.793
But he is going to get married so we will give him realization,

01:09:55.901 --> 01:10:00.793
we just couldn’t give him, but married life improves like this.

01:10:00.901 --> 01:10:20.793
Q14. [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:33.793
A 14. What is it about Bhagwan? [HINDI]

01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:43.793
This kind of a Bhagwan, who cannot even smell a flower. Can you think of a Bhagwan like that?

01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:48.793
You know in the Devi Mahatmayam or into the Vishnu Shastranama,

01:10:48.901 --> 01:10:56.793
or anyone of them where there is a described God at least twenty five names of God is he’s fond of flower, fragrance, flower.

01:10:56.901 --> 01:11:02.793
I can’t live without flowers and the fellow who cannot smell a flower [HINDI]

01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:08.793
I mean what do you give him? Phenyl or something?

01:11:08.901 --> 01:11:28.793
This is one of the tests. How can you be a Bhagwan? [SANSKRIT] These are the names of God.

01:11:28.901 --> 01:11:49.793
Q15. [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:49.901 --> 01:11:54.793
A15. You see, say now if I give you Indian money say 100 rupees how do you know it is 100 rupees?

01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:58.793
You have to go to India and spend it and see if it works out or not.

01:11:58.901 --> 01:12:03.793
In the same way when you get the vibrations and you feel the cool breeze you spend it

01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:09.793
and see for yourself and judge it.

01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:14.793
You can do the whole process yourself, you can give realization to others all right?

01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:24.793
You see now I would say please get your realization, if you get it, I don’t promise, if you get it.

01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:31.793
That’s a very big if, sometimes. I know it happens if you get it

01:12:31.901 --> 01:12:37.793
then you have to go and see for yourself whether it works or not.

01:12:37.901 --> 01:12:43.793
But to get it is not easy in certain cases,

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:50.793
so be cheerful about it and be patient with yourself.

01:12:50.901 --> 01:12:54.793
More patience is needed with yourself, not with Me because I am extremely patient.

01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:59.793
You have to be patient with yourself because your mind will be coming up and always saying something,

01:12:59.901 --> 01:13:03.793
you didn’t ask this question, you should have asked this question, tell your mind to be quiet.

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:07.793
Take your realization, lets see if it works out.

01:13:07.901 --> 01:13:15.793
We cannot assure, it may, it may not, it’s your luck, that’s it.

01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:43.793
Q16. [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:43.901 --> 01:13:48.793
A16. This conscious mind that you have just now is the human awareness, all right,

01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:55.793
at this point the human awareness is at such a stage, that you are not connected with your spirit.

01:13:55.901 --> 01:13:59.793
First your human awareness has to be raised it has to be brought to that point

01:13:59.901 --> 01:14:03.793
where you get connected. Like this instrument is here now,

01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:07.793
consciously whatever you do with this it is not connected, it has no meaning.

01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:10.793
In the same way first you should be connected.

01:14:10.901 --> 01:14:14.793
After connecting only we can see where is the problem is, what is missing, what is it

01:14:14.901 --> 01:14:19.793
and is to be done. So we have to take a very reasonable attitude towards it,

01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:23.793
about ourselves, to understand that maybe there is something missing,

01:14:23.901 --> 01:14:28.793
something is happening, it’s not working out.

01:14:28.901 --> 01:14:35.793
Because at this awareness, at this consciousness that you have, this human consciousness is not sufficient.

01:14:35.901 --> 01:14:39.793
So you have to jump, there’s a breakthrough, and you have to achieve that breakthrough.

01:14:39.901 --> 01:14:43.793
Which I will not promise, as I told that gentleman there you, it cannot be promised,

01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:51.793
it has to be achieved. If you get it then you have to have patience with yourself work it out and see for yourself.

01:14:51.901 --> 01:15:03.793
Q17. [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:03.901 --> 01:15:06.793
A17. Yes They did because that was the time you see.

01:15:06.901 --> 01:15:09.793
Now Jesus came at a time when our Agnya chakra was opened,

01:15:09.901 --> 01:15:18.793
see it’s like a Tree of Life has to grow you see and They come at a proper time what has to grow.

01:15:18.901 --> 01:15:22.793
Now if it’s the root time and somebody else came in, when the shoot started

01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:26.793
somebody else came in gradually it has come up to this point. Now Mohammed,

01:15:26.901 --> 01:15:29.793
what Mohamed has said, nobody says that today.

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:34.793
All the Muslims must know that He said “At the time of the resurrection your hands must speak”,

01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:40.793
where is that? He said it I mean nobody else but Mohammed had said so clearly about it.

01:15:40.901 --> 01:15:47.793
And what does He say is not known nobody knows why He said [INAUDIBLE-namas] like this.

01:15:47.901 --> 01:15:50.793
Nobody asked questions, why do you follow?

01:15:50.901 --> 01:15:54.793
But after Sahaja yoga will know what [INAUDIBLE] what Mohammed means,

01:15:54.901 --> 01:15:59.793
who He was and why He said so what is so important about it.

01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:04.793
You can’t understand even Mohammed or anyone, Jesus or anyone, without realization

01:16:04.901 --> 01:16:10.793
because you have not entered into that rank, you see My point.

01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:16.793
Because the time that time was not to say whatever They had to do They did very important work very, very important.

01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:20.793
Every one of Them have worked very hard.

01:16:20.901 --> 01:16:28.793
Only I must say that today I am at an advantage than They are

01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:37.793
because so many are getting self-realization. They had a very bad time.

01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:44.793
They had a very bad time nobody accepted Them. All acceptance came later on when

01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:47.793
They were not there and people liked to have such acceptance

01:16:47.901 --> 01:16:52.793
because they can do what they like. They don’t want to,

01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:56.793
nobody asked Them for realization at that time, nobody, everybody tried just to kill Them.

01:16:56.901 --> 01:17:05.793
I mean everybody was anxious how to get rid of Them, isn’t it a fact?

01:17:05.901 --> 01:17:09.793
Like today as there are so many who want their realization that time was not there.

01:17:09.901 --> 01:17:14.793
Today is the time, all right?

01:17:14.901 --> 01:17:45.793
Q18. [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:45.901 --> 01:17:49.793
A18. You see that you don’t even need one minute for that, to say, “I’m born again”

01:17:49.901 --> 01:17:55.793
it is all self-opinionated thing, just to say. But you have to have powers you see

01:17:55.901 --> 01:17:57.793
that’s what I told you the whole lecture was like that.

01:17:57.901 --> 01:18:02.793
That once you get self realised you get the powers you have collective consciousness you become conscious.

01:18:02.901 --> 01:18:08.793
You see it is very easy to say, just to put the, I don’t know how much they pay

01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:13.793
but you just put the name membership “I’m born again”. You don’t know this born again people,

01:18:13.901 --> 01:18:18.793
horribly hot tempered, useless people absolutely. You see some of them brought some bibles

01:18:18.901 --> 01:18:22.793
and one lady bearing all artificial jewellery here and there and she came to give Me the bible

01:18:22.901 --> 01:18:28.793
and I just ignored her. I just started laughing and she was quite surprised to hear this sound.

01:18:28.901 --> 01:18:34.793
So this is what born again how can they be born again if they can’t make out a saint.

01:18:34.901 --> 01:18:37.793
How can they be born again? [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:51.901 --> 01:19:00.793
Only the truth will survive. All these are fads and things [INAUDIBLE] it has no meaning.

01:19:02.217 --> 01:19:10.109
Let’s have our realization now all of us, but I don’t promise as I said it’s your own lookout.

01:19:10.217 --> 01:19:16.109
If you believe in our, according to Indian thing if you believe, according to our former karmas

01:19:16.217 --> 01:19:23.109
according to our previous things that we get Atma Sakshatkar, because it’s the highest to have.

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:29.109
So let’s see what happens. And also My compassion, My love,

01:19:29.217 --> 01:19:35.109
My desire that you all should get your realisation and establish it

01:19:35.217 --> 01:19:42.109
and become powerful Sahaja yogis and understand it fully.

01:19:42.217 --> 01:19:49.109
Now those who are here have to follow what I say,

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:53.109
is very simple method by which you help yourself. As I said you are your own guru

01:19:53.217 --> 01:19:59.109
and on different chakras we have to work it out and it works.

01:19:59.217 --> 01:20:04.109
So please take out your shoes for one reason, that the Mother Earth helps us

01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:11.109
to sort of earth some of the problems that have come from the Mother Earth.

01:20:11.217 --> 01:20:19.109
Now, you have to keep your eyes shut throughout, not to open your eyes.

01:20:19.217 --> 01:20:27.109
The reasons are many but one of them is that the centre of Agnya,

01:20:27.217 --> 01:20:35.109
which is placed between the pituitary and the pineal body, is a very important centre.

01:20:35.217 --> 01:20:43.109
It is the gate and it doesn’t open if your eyes are open outside just now.

01:20:43.217 --> 01:20:49.109
So please keep your eyes shut till then and maybe the kundalini may not also rise.

01:20:49.217 --> 01:20:55.109
The whole attitude should be that I should get my realization. You’re not going to lose anything,

01:20:55.217 --> 01:21:01.109
I don’t take any money, nothing of the kind, and there is nothing to gain out of it anyway.

01:21:01.217 --> 01:21:06.109
So just you have to gain something out of it so, in a humble way,

01:21:06.217 --> 01:21:12.109
you have to sit down and put your hands on your lap.

01:21:12.217 --> 01:21:18.109
Those people who have come for the first time, or are standing there, can come forward here

01:21:18.217 --> 01:21:21.109
and sit down and the Sahaja yogis should give them places.

01:21:21.217 --> 01:21:29.109
Sahaja yogis should never take the first places, I would request, it would be a good idea.

01:21:46.217 --> 01:21:56.109
All right, just try to sit on the side if possible, those who have come for the first time.

01:21:56.217 --> 01:23:18.109
[ASIDE ABOUT A PARKED CAR]

01:23:18.217 --> 01:23:24.109
Now, as I told you, you don’t have to do anything. It’s an effortless thing that happens,

01:23:24.217 --> 01:23:29.109
it’s a happening, and the kundalini rises by itself.

01:23:29.217 --> 01:23:34.109
Only put both your feet straight on the Mother Earth. Straight, as far as possible,

01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:38.109
straight touching the Mother Earth. But those who are sitting on the ground are all right,

01:23:38.217 --> 01:23:54.109
they can sit with [HINDI], on the ground is all right. [HINDI]

01:23:54.217 --> 01:24:08.109
Now put your both the hands towards Me, as I told you, and close your eyes.

01:24:08.217 --> 01:24:13.109
We have to have a proper attitude towards ourselves.

01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:17.109
Firstly, it’s going to be the happiest thing that is going to happen to us,

01:24:17.217 --> 01:24:22.109
and the highest thing that we have been asking for ages.

01:24:22.217 --> 01:24:28.109
So we are not to be in any way under any tension about it, it’s really happening to all of us.

01:24:28.217 --> 01:24:34.109
Sit with a very cheerful mind, not frivolous but cheerful mind.

01:24:34.217 --> 01:24:38.109
And secondly you have to respect yourself.

01:24:38.217 --> 01:24:42.109
If there is any guilt or anything in your mind, it won’t work out, as I told you.

01:24:42.217 --> 01:24:46.109
You must know you’re saints, born to get self-realization.

01:24:46.217 --> 01:24:54.109
You are, as described by William Blake, you are men of God, who have to become prophets,

01:24:54.217 --> 01:24:57.109
who will have powers to make others prophets.

01:24:57.217 --> 01:25:02.109
So, that is the attitude we should have towards ourselves, that’s how you are here today.

01:25:02.217 --> 01:25:08.109
Please do not condemn yourself, do not have any guilt about yourself, nothing of the kind.

01:25:08.217 --> 01:25:13.109
Just believe in yourself, that you are the Spirit.

01:25:13.217 --> 01:25:24.109
Now, you have to keep both the hands on your lap (you can keep your purse down, lady, you can keep it, it’s all right).

01:25:24.217 --> 01:25:30.109
Now put your both the hands towards Me, close your eyes fully.

01:25:30.217 --> 01:25:36.109
Some of you must have already started feeling a little cool breeze in your hands.

01:25:36.217 --> 01:25:46.109
Put both the hands like this, open upwards, just as like you do for [INAUDIBLE] or something.

01:25:51.217 --> 01:25:59.109
The left side, as I told you the other day, is for your desire, and the right side is for action.

01:25:59.217 --> 01:26:06.109
So we are going to put the left hand, all the time, as it is, desiring to be one with the Divine.

01:26:06.217 --> 01:26:20.109
And the right hand we are going to use for the action of removing the obstacles in our centres.

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:28.109
So, first put the right hand on the heart, just on the heart, on the left hand side.

01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:40.109
Here resides the Spirit in human beings, so, now you ask Me a question without opening your eyes.

01:26:40.217 --> 01:26:47.109
You can call Me Mataji or Mother, as you like, whichever way you want to call Me.

01:26:47.217 --> 01:26:53.109
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:26:53.217 --> 01:26:59.109
Ask the question thrice, you have a right to ask Me that question.

01:27:17.217 --> 01:27:24.109
Now this right hand has to be taken down on the stomach, on the left hand side, on the upper part of the stomach.

01:27:24.217 --> 01:27:35.109
This is the centre of your mastery, or what we call the guru centre, it is on the left hand side of your stomach.

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:42.109
On the left hand side you put this right hand. Put the left hand towards Me as it is.

01:27:42.217 --> 01:27:52.109
Now, here you ask a question, because you, as a spirit, has to be your own master, has to be your own Guru.

01:27:52.217 --> 01:27:59.109
So you ask Me a question thrice again, “Mother, am I my own Guru?” ask Me.

01:27:59.217 --> 01:28:03.109
With full confidence, “Am I my own master?”

01:28:03.217 --> 01:28:25.109
On the higher part of the stomach, please put your right hand on the higher part of the stomach.

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:36.109
Now, put this right hand on the left hand side of your stomach, in the lower region.

01:28:36.217 --> 01:28:41.109
There’s a centre there, in the lower region of your stomach, lower region of your stomach.

01:28:41.217 --> 01:28:45.109
On the left hand side, keeping the left hand towards Me.

01:28:45.217 --> 01:29:03.109
Now, this is the centre where is the knowledge of the working of your kundalini.

01:29:03.217 --> 01:29:10.109
In this centre, called as Shuddha Vidya, meaning the pure knowledge.

01:29:10.217 --> 01:29:19.109
As this point, I’m sorry but you have to ask for it, I cannot force anyone into it,

01:29:19.217 --> 01:29:24.109
like you cannot force a student to accept any knowledge.

01:29:24.217 --> 01:29:37.109
In the same way you have to say “Mother, give me that pure knowledge” or you can say “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”,

01:29:37.217 --> 01:29:42.109
you have to ask six times, because this centre has got six sub plexuses.

01:29:42.217 --> 01:29:53.109
So you have to ask six times, in a very humble way, “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”.

01:29:53.217 --> 01:29:59.109
That is the first asking.

01:29:59.217 --> 01:30:14.109
See this prayer, this is such a pure prayer. Give me the Shuddha Vidya, give me the pure knowledge of the Divine, the working of the Divine.

01:30:14.217 --> 01:30:32.109
Now, as you have entered into that realm of asking Me for the pure knowledge, the first thing you have to assume, is that
