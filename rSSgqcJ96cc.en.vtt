00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:12.524
Now, second is about food.

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:18.080
But that’s the first seeking human
beings had as animals.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.772
No attention on food.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.971
Whether you have salt or not, whether
you have this or that

00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.058
- no attention on food.

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:39.136
Actually, you should not remember
what you ate this morning.

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:43.795
But we think as to what we are going
to eat tomorrow.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.954
We consume food not for running this body
but for sort of a

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:58.853
more satisfaction of tongue pleasures.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:05.333
Once you start understanding that pleasure
is a sign of gross attention

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:11.918
- any kind of pleasure is a very

00:01:13.037 --> 00:01:20.397
gross sensationalization - sensations.
Very gross it is.

00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:26.261
But when I say, "No pleasures," means, doesn't
mean that you should become serious people

00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:34.404
and people of, sort of, 
as if somebody is dead in your family!

00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:41.510
But you should be like Shiva.
So detached.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.910
He came on a bull, which was running
very fast, to get married.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.146
He was sitting on a bull with His two feet
like this, you see,

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:52.866
and the bull is running fast and He is
holding the bull.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.772
The feet like this!

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.401
And He’s coming for His wedding.

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.343
And with Him are coming people
with one eye,

00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:12.261
without noses, all kinds of funny people
coming with Him.

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:17.879
And His wife feeling quite embarrassed
at the nonsensical

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:22.412
things people are talking about Shiva.

00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.117
He is not bothered what’s His reputation
would be, this thing.

00:02:28.197 --> 00:02:33.581
But that doesn't mean that you become
hippies. You see this is the problem is:

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.998
that once you start thinking like that,
you become hippies.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:45.789
So attachment to anything is ugliness.

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:49.934
Is ugliness, is nonsense.

00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:55.070
But you can dress up whatever way
you like,

00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:58.881
or even if you are in the most ordinary
dress,

00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:03.122
you will look the most magnificent person.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.935
But it's not that if you, if you say that,
"All right, so under these circumstances,

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:13.941
let us go about on a one sheet wrapped
around".

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:18.256
The beauty that has evolved within you
through Spirit,

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:22.078
gives you that power that you can wear
whatever you feel like -

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:27.372
makes no difference to your beauty,
your beauty is there all the time.

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.836
But have you achieved that state?

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:38.873
And that state only you achieve when
your Spirit enters into your brain.

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:44.214
With ego-oriented people is more difficult,
and that’s why they cannot enjoy things.

00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:48.369
At the slightest pretext, they topple
down.

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:55.632
And Spirit, which is the source of joy,
just doesn't come in,

00:03:55.712 --> 00:04:03.329
doesn't show. The joy is beauty.
The joy itself is beauty.

00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:10.345
But that is a state one has to achieve.

00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:14.924
Attachments come by various methods.

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:21.869
If you go little ahead with it, then you
have attachments of your family,

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.969
“What will happen to my child? What will
happen to my husband?

00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:30.830
What will happen to my mother, to my
wife?", this, that nonsense.

00:04:33.223 --> 00:04:40.038
Who is your father and who is your mother?
Who is your husband and who is your wife?

00:04:40.118 --> 00:04:43.886
For Shiva, He doesn't know all these
things.

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:50.752
To Him, He and His Power are inseparable
things.

00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:56.546
So He stands as singular personality.

00:04:57.286 --> 00:05:05.096
There is no dual... duality. When there is
duality, then only you say, “my wife.”

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:13.618
You go on saying, “my nose, my ears,
my hands,

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:18.856
my, my, my, my.” Go, go, go deep down.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:24.021
Till you say “my”, there is some duality.

00:05:27.387 --> 00:05:34.157
But when I say, "I, the nose", then
there is no duality.

00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:39.934
Shiva the Shakti, Shakti the Shiva.
There’s no duality.

00:05:40.014 --> 00:05:46.180
But we live throughout on our duality,
and because of that,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.112
there is an attachment. If there is no
duality, what is the attachment, you see?

00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:57.106
If you are the light and you are the lamp,
then where is the duality?

00:05:57.186 --> 00:06:03.012
If you are the moon and you are the
moonlight, then where is the duality?

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:06.338
If you are the sun and you are
the sunlight,

00:06:06.418 --> 00:06:13.058
you are the word and you are the meaning,
then where is the duality?

00:06:13.178 --> 00:06:19.392
That's only possible when your Spirit
comes into your brain,

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:26.856
and you become part and parcel of Virat
Itself. Virat is the brain, as I told you.

00:06:33.522 --> 00:06:37.566
Then everything that you do - when you
show your temper,

00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:41.209
when you show your affection, when you
show your compassion, anything -

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:47.121
is the Spirit that is expressing, because
brain has lost its identity.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.869
The so-called limited brain, it has
become the unlimited Spirit.

00:06:52.976 --> 00:07:01.729
So the Spirit is like the ocean,
which has the light in it.

00:07:02.603 --> 00:07:11.025
And when this ocean pours into
the little cup of our brain,

00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:18.667
the cup loses its identity, and everything
becomes spiritual. Everything.

00:07:18.748 --> 00:07:23.605
You can make everything spiritual,
everything. You touch anything, is spiritual:

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:27.510
this sand becomes spiritual, 
the land becomes spiritual,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.839
atmosphere becomes spiritual,
celestial bodies become spiritual.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.804
Everything becomes spiritual.

00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:44.439
So is the ocean that is the Spirit,
while your brain is limited.

00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:52.178
So the detachment from your limited brain
has to be brought in.

00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:57.744
All limitations of brain should be broken,
so that when this ocean

00:07:57.824 --> 00:08:07.540
fills that brain, it should break
that little cup,

00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:12.421
and every bit of that cup should become
colourful.

00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:19.192
The whole atmosphere, everything,
whatever you locate, should be colourful.

00:08:19.272 --> 00:08:22.532
Colour of the Spirit is the light
of the Spirit;

00:08:22.612 --> 00:08:30.254
and this light of the Spirit acts, works,
thinks, coordinates, does everything.

00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:38.549
This is the reason today I decide
to bring Shiva Tattwa to the brain.

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:44.506
The first procedure is to take your brain
towards the Shiva Tattwa by telling it,

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:49.219
"See, where are you going, Mr. Brain?

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:53.176
You're putting attention to this,
you're putting attention to that,

00:08:53.256 --> 00:08:56.786
getting involved - now detach, become
the brain yourself.

00:08:56.866 --> 00:09:00.859
Only the brain. Detach, Detach".

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:06.411
And then, take this detached brain,
completely filled with the colour

00:09:06.491 --> 00:09:10.953
of the Spirit. It will automatically
happen.

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:20.339
As long as you'll have these limitations
to your attention, it will not happen.

00:09:21.454 --> 00:09:30.340
So one has to really, deliberately
do this tapasya. Every individual.

00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:35.243
I'm with you;

00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:41.758
so you don't need any puja that way.

00:09:41.838 --> 00:09:51.335
But that state has to be achieved, and for
achieving that state, you need the puja.

00:09:54.019 --> 00:10:01.370
I hope, so many of you'll become
the Shiva Tattwas in My lifetime.

00:10:05.944 --> 00:10:09.270
But don't think I'm asking you to suffer.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:14.167
There is no suffering in this kind
of an ascent.

00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:19.504
If you understand that this is the complete
joyous state,

00:10:19.584 --> 00:10:22.823
that is the time when you become
Nirananda.

00:10:22.903 --> 00:10:27.471
That's the joy named in the Sahasrara,

00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:33.398
the name of the joy is Nirananda, and
you know your Mother's name is Nira.

00:10:33.478 --> 00:10:37.242
So you become Nirananda.
