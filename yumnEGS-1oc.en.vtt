00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.010
Now what are the effects on the illness?

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.010
And of course we've seen that in meditation
you have less mental clutter, so obviously

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.820
it seems logical that meditators should have
better mental health and this is exactly what

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.380
has been found.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.779
This is a study from Doctor Adam Morgan at
Exeter University.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.850
He took a group of people with depression
and he gave them Sahaja Yoga meditation;

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.130
nothing;

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
or the treatment you get in the NHS, with
cognitive behavioural therapy.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.839
And this treatment is supposed to work.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.400
But in this study, it didn't work.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.720
But Sahaja Yoga meditation worked significantly
better as you can see, and that was the only

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.720
significant improvement.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.960
So the depressed people became significantly
less anxious after six weeks of Sahaja Yoga

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.960
meditation, less depressed, and they had less
general mental illness.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.820
This is a study on anxiety by Doctor Chung
from Philadelphia University and she gave

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.820
sixty six Sahaja Yoga meditators and controls,
she gave the meditators very intensive, one

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.740
week treatment in a meditation hospital.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.780
And as you can see the meditators significantly
improved in their anxiety, while the controls

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.460
got the normal hospital treatment.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.630
And they actually became worse, and the difference
was of course highly significant.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.549
So meditation was much better than the traditional
hospital treatment which actually made them

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.420
worse.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.090
This is a study on work stress and as you
know, we are all quite stressed at work and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.119
it's a big problem.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.159
Work stress is associated with a lot of health
problems.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.710
In this study, Doctor Ramesh Manocha from
Australia, he tested people, he gave them

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.229
eight weeks of Sahaja Yoga meditation, or
he gave them relaxation response - and relaxation

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.350
response is something which is used in TM
(Transcendental Meditation).

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.350
So as you can see, the relaxation response
had no effect, so it didn't make them better,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.080
but Sahaja Yoga meditation made these people
who were stressed at work significantly better.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.800
So the stress symptoms
became significantly better.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.030
So these are all improvements of course.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.090
The depression became significantly better,
and the anxiety didn't quite reach significance.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.190
But as you can see, also better on the anxiety.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.280
This is a study on ADHD (Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder), so these are children

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.680
who are restless, impulsive, and have problems
with attention.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.409
So of course we thought that meditation would
be good, because it makes them calmer, and

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.650
it improves attention and we've seen it enhances
attention areas.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.519
And in fact, this is what happened - so these
people got six weeks, they were children,

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.659
they got six weeks of Sahaja Yoga meditation,
together with their parents, and they improved

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.890
significantly in their ADHD symptoms.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.750
What is interesting that the effect was similar
to that of stimulant medication.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.700
Hyperactive children normally get Ritalin
- and it improves the symptoms, but it has

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.540
side-effects.

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.829
So, it affects the sleep, it affects the growth,
and of course if you can have an improvement

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.510
without any side-effects through meditation
then that's better.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.629
Especially in a child which still has a developing
brain.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.950
And they all improve, although most of them
even stopped their Ritalin, their medication.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.469
Although they stopped or reduced their medication,
they still improved significantly.

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:43.469
This is a study on drug consumption, this
is done by Doctor Wolfgang Hackl from Austria.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.819
So he tested, people who entered meditation
and he followed them up for a year, and asked

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.150
them questions about their drug use.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.150
What is quite interesting is, that after only
one week, almost 60% of drug users stopped

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.950
their drug consumption.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.840
This is really remarkable because they were
partly, some of them were heroin abusers,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.219
cocaine, amphetamines.

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.540
And what he found that after a year, only
7% still took their drugs.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:22.960
And, I work in a mental hospital and there
is no treatment that works as well as this.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.480
So this is really quite remarkable.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.080
You don't find this anywhere else.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.610
So what about physical illness?

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.410
I've shown you before that meditation enhances
the parasympathetic nervous system, which

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.810
restores your bodily function.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.380
And of course this should have an effect on
your physical body.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.630
And this is exactly what has been shown, again
this is a study by Doctor Chung which I've

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.260
shown you before, where people with hypertension
significantly improved with one week of intensive

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.210
meditation.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.810
There have been several studies in India who
have shown that people improve with epilepsy.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.480
And epilepsy is quite a severe disease, you
have epileptic attacks quite frequently, and

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.330
you have to take quite severe drugs with severe
side-effects.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:17.200
In these studies, what all of them showed
that the number of epileptic attacks can be

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.220
significantly reduced with meditation.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.220
So this is after three months, and this is
after six months.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.040
This is a study by Doctor Ramesh Manocha from
Australia, and he found that meditation has

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.440
a significant effect on Asthma.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.620
These people meditated for two months, two
times weekly, and the Asthma you can measure

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.170
in an objective way, they had a significant
reduction of the Asthma indicators, of the

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.780
severity of the Asthma.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.130
What is interesting about this study is that
after two months, they stopped the treatment

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.310
- the meditation - and then he followed them
up after another month.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.030
And what happened is after the month when
they stopped the meditation, they all went

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.520
back to the same severity of Asthma they had
before.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.830
So what this means is, if you use meditation
to cure any of your illnesses or diseases

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.660
you have to do it for life, you have to do
it regularly and you can't just stop when

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.080
you notice you feel some health benefits.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.270
Because they will come back.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.340
So meditation really is a discipline for life,
and I think that's a reason why few people

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.090
use it, because you have to do it regularly
and forever, if you want to have the benefits.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.870
And some people find it easier to take a pill
than to actually sit down for fifteen minutes

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.620
in the morning, fifteen minutes in the evening
and get yourself disciplined and go into meditation.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.240
But as you see, it's as effective as drugs.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.420
This is a study on menopause, and again there
was a significant reduction of the hot flushes

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.230
of women in the menopause phase.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.840
What is interesting, the effect was similar
to Hormone Replacement Therapy and Hormone

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.500
Replacement Therapy has been associated with
increased cancer risk.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.500
So again, if you can avoid the cancer risk,
it's better to use meditation.
