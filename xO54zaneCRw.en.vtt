00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.930
Today we are going to do puja to Shiva, Shri
Shiva. As you know, Shri Shiva is the reflection

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.549
of Sadashiva within us.

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:58.549
I’ve already told about the reflection.
Sadashiva is the God Almighty, the one who

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.340
sees the play of Adi Shakti. But He is the
Father who is watching each one of His Creation

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.160
or Her Creation.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.160
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely, fully
strengthening. There’s no doubt in His mind

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.490
about the capability of the Adi Shakti. But
when He finds that in the play of Adi Shakti,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.300
the people or the world as such, try to disturb
Her, or to spoil Her work, then He gets into

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:28.330
His wrathful mood, and He destroys all such
people, and maybe, He destroys the whole world.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:44.070
On one side He’s wrathful, no doubt, on
the other side, He is the ocean of compassion

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:54.050
and joy. That’s why, when He is reflected
within us, we get our Self-realisation, we

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.580
get the light of our Spirit and we get into
the ocean of joy.

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:18.289
Also He is the ocean of knowledge, so those
who get Self-realised get the knowledge of

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.120
the Divine, which is very subtle, permeating
into every atom and molecule, the power of

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.620
this knowledge is there.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.620
His style is such that, in his compassion,
He forgives even very cruel rakshasas, if

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:08.010
they dedicate themselves to Him. Because His
compassion has no limits and sometimes the

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:23.250
same people who are blessed by Him try to
trouble the devotees of Adi Shakti – but

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:35.719
it is just to create a drama, an event. Unless
and until there is some drama, people won’t

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.960
understand. We had to have Ramayana, we had
to have Mahabharata, we had to have Christ

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:53.389
being crucified, we had to have Mohammed being
tortured. All that drama was there because

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.620
without events, people don’t remember.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:07.620
So in the spiritual life of human beings,
they have seen lots of dramas between the

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:17.530
blessings of Shiva and the powers of the Adi
Shakti. As the time has moved, today in the

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:32.919
history of spirituality a great discovery
has been made, that people can get their realisation

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.449
in the collective, en-masse. Thousands can
get their realisation.

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:48.449
Now, we should know what is that realisation
we have got, what does that mean and what

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.880
is the culminating point.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.880
First of all, I have to tell you, the mind
about which we speak and depend upon is a

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:09.500
myth. There’s nothing like mind. Brain is
reality, not the mind. Mind is created by

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:20.040
us reacting to outside, either we react to
conditionings or ego. Thus this mind is created

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:30.689
like bubbles in the ocean of reality, but
that’s not reality.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:39.260
This mind, whatever we decide, we know, is
very limited, illusive and sometimes shocking.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:52.970
The mind always move in a linear direction,
and because there’s no reality in it, it

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.760
recoils, and boomerangs. Thus all the enterprises,
all the projections so far we have done, it

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.120
seems, come back to us. Whatever they discover,
comes back to us as a big destructive power

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.800
or a very big shock.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.800
So one has to decide what to do, how to be
out of this trap of our mind. Kundalini is

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:39.430
the solution. When She’s awakened, She takes
you, with that awakening, She takes you beyond

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
your mind. The first thing is to go beyond
your mind. With mind, you’ll do many things,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:54.290
but it will not be satisfying, it will be
not a solution, it will not help you. And

00:10:54.290 --> 00:11:00.220
when we start depending too much on our mind
we develop all kinds of physical, mental,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:07.220
emotional problem. Now the latest is the stress,
and this stress has no solution they say,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:14.410
but in Sahaja Yoga, we find the solution,
by crossing over this mind. It’s like a

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:24.050
barrier for our advancement.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:31.050
So when you get your realisation, you must
understand that your Kundalini has taken your

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:39.230
attention beyond the mind. Now, this reaction
to outside has come because we human beings

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:48.350
have a prism-like brain, or we can say a prism-like
skull, and when the energy passes into it,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.160
I’ve explained it in My books, it goes into
bifurcations, or you can say refractions,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.649
by which our attention goes out, and we react.

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:08.649
If we react too much, then these bubbles create
a very horrible mind which can lead to any

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:17.810
kind of thing. It justifies itself, it pampers
your ego. The ego and the conditioning that

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.160
creates this mind start using this mind for
the purpose of their fulfilment, of their,

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:41.589
all the accumulation of ideas and thoughts
which has no backing, which has no reality

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.920
with it.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:55.920
It’s like we make the computer [and] ultimately
we become slaves of the computer, we make

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:03.730
the watches ourselves, and then we become
slaves of the watches. That’s how it dominates

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:10.730
human beings. And when a person who has a
very strong mind decides to destroy, like

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:21.040
Hitler did, with some idea, he can go on destroying
which has a very far fetched effect on our

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:25.730
culture, on our spirituality.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:32.730
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly
aware – where you cross your mind, you go

00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:42.709
above your mind, mind cannot affect you. This
is the first stage as we call, is thoughtless

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.480
awareness.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.480
Second one is where you start seeing the working
of this Paramchaitanya, of this All-pervading

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:58.240
Power. And you start becoming aware that there
is lot of truth in what Mataji says. That

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:10.870
there is this Power that works out many things.
It works miraculously so many things for you.

00:14:12.089 --> 00:14:19.089
It gives you blessings, It guides you, It
helps you in so many ways It helps you. It

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:27.209
gives you good health, good wealth, and also
a very good society of very beautiful people

00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:35.759
in the collective. All that you can see clearly
is happening here.

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:43.029
Now this happening of achieving thoughtless
awareness is very simple and easy, but to

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:05.130
maintain at that point is difficult. We still
react and we think. Anything you see, you

00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:14.889
react. To get to that point in thoughtless
awareness is first to change your attention.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:25.980
Now, for example, once we were climbing a
very high mountain to see one temple called

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:35.380
Palitana – Myself, My son-in-law and My
daughter. And we were really tired because

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.410
we had to climb, I don’t know how many steps
and when we went up we were tired and there

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:48.300
was a little canopy made of beautiful marble
carving, so we just lay down there ourselves.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.790
They were very tired and they said : “What
is this kind of a temple!” They were grudging.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:16:00.790
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful
elephants were carved. So I told My son-in-law,

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:10.470
“Look at these elephants, they all have
tails of different types.” He said “Mummy,

00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:17.829
we are all dying, how can you see the tails
of elephants?” But is just to divert their

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:25.769
attention from that tiredness [that] I told
them that – why not see the tails of the

00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:28.019
elephant, which is very different.

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:35.019
So what happens [is] that, when you are putting
your attention so much to outside all the

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:44.220
time, then you must first of all also divert
your attention. For example, you see these

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:52.500
beautifully made things here. Your attention
is something else – just try to enjoy the

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.310
beauty of that. You see. there are beautiful
carpets here – just look at them without

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:04.389
thinking, because they don’t belong to you,
so no headache, they belong to somebody else,

00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:09.220
is very good! Otherwise, if it belongs to
you you start thinking ; “Oh, My God, I

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.069
have spread them here, what will happen, they
have to be insured!” Or some sort of a thing

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.780
like that. That’s common human reaction.
But if it doesn’t belong to you, you can

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:25.780
watch it nicely. Now you watch it and don’t
think. You’ll be amazed, when you see the

00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:32.909
beauty that is put inside this, you’ll see
the artist who has put his joy, his exuberance

00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:39.909
into it, and you’ll be amazed, after realisation,
that, this exuberance will fill into you and

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:49.290
a cool kind of a relaxation will come into
you, and this Kundalini will rise, and you’ll

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:57.110
become steady in your thoughtless awareness.
So whenever you look at anything, look at

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:04.110
any beautiful thing, even say, today’s election,
just watch the man that is elected. Watching

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:15.889
him, itself, gives him blessings, gives him
better ideas. You get also ideas, which are

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:24.500
coming from reality, which are there – how
to make this man a successful person, or this

00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:29.389
country a successful democracy.

00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:36.389
All these things happen when your attention
is diverted from criticising, from reacting

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:47.340
– just you watch, become the witness, try
to witness everything. It’s not so very

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:56.500
yet practised, so far, I’ve seen, that,
whenever even we get our, achieve our, realisation,

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:03.649
we don’t realise that we have to witness
everything. When you start witnessing through

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:10.649
your Spirit, then you don’t see the bad
points of another, but you see the good points.

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:17.899
You just pick up the person with very good
points.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:25.100
So once you see that, the witness state enlarges,
and you start enjoying another person. You

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:34.700
start enjoying every thing that is there,
even a small blade of grass you can enjoy,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:42.120
if you have that capacity. In Japan, Zen system
started on these lines and he made, Vidhitama

00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:53.909
was the person who started it, he made a garden
out of moss, different moss, you know, very

00:19:59.629 --> 00:20:05.940
small, small. Then there were little, little
flowers also. And hardly about five feet of

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:12.940
the garden, which looks like the shape of
a question mark you can say. You have to go

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:20.520
on a lift, and you reach that platform on
top of a hill, or a mountain where you see

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:28.909
this. All little, little mosses are there,
and you see, differently arranged a beautiful

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:35.909
garden. When you start seeing it, your thought
stops, because such a marvellous thing, when

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.629
you put attention to it, to its creation,
your thoughts stop.

00:20:42.629 --> 00:20:49.629
So you must practise as to find out what stops
your thoughts. What makes you the witness.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:57.750
Once you develop this habit, you will station
yourself nicely in the thoughtless awareness.

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:06.929
Then you start watching how Sahaja Yoga has
helped you, how it has been blissful, what

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.510
you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga. You
will be amazed, if you just start watching

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:22.419
it, everywhere you’ll be amazed how this
Paramchaitanya acts.

00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:29.419
Nowadays, this Paramchaitanya has become active
because of Kruta yuga. You can see from the

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:36.560
way it is playing around, with vibrations
around Me. You’ve seen so many photographs

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:43.500
of mine where these vibrations are there.
Also you’ve seen the photographs of many

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.530
sahaja yogis seating before Me, on their heads
My name is written down in Arabic language.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:56.530
You’ve seen so many ways by which you can
find out that there is the play of the Divine.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:05.190
Now the mind will still try to say some things.
Don’t listen, just watch. The effect of

00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:12.399
Sahaja Yoga you should watch on yourself,
on your own body. Don’t think about it but

00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:15.320
watch it, and you’ll be amazed how you have
changed.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:22.010
To be very frank, when I come to Australia
every year, sometimes I can’t even recognise

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:29.010
you. You look much younger, much better, much
happier, and I don’t recognise who are these

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.540
people.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:37.540
It is this witness state which takes you to
another realm which we call as doubtless awareness.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:45.560
At that state, you can become so empowered
that
you can give realisation to others, you can

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:03.530
give complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga,
you can talk to them. Also you emit.

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:14.679
(talks aside in Hindi)
You see, when I’m watching, I’m absorbing

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:25.149
the heat, that’s My trouble.

00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:32.149
So your whole state, spiritual state, becomes
so much blissful, you become so powerful,

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:43.730
you become so compassionate and so loving,
so balanced, completely cleansed with all

00:23:46.889 --> 00:23:53.889
the destructive ideas you have, all the depressive
ideas you have, and then you really stand

00:23:55.619 --> 00:24:01.619
up as a great sahaji who can do tremendous
work.

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:08.619
Like recently I heard that Germans and Austrians
are now going to Israel, because they think

00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:16.089
Jews were killed by their forefathers, and
there’s a big centre now started in Israel.

00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:22.149
Just imagine! How these people, once [they]
reach that state, go to countries single-handed.

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:29.149
They have done so much. Same in Turkey, same
in places which are very tremendously remote

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:39.820
in South Africa. Because, from inside they
become completely confident, in thoughtless

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:49.399
awareness, as well as doubtlessly aware.

00:24:49.399 --> 00:24:56.399
But now, once you start growing by meditative
attention, what happens [is] that your attention

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:06.010
becomes enlightened. Now the job is to motivate
your attention. It’s not just to enjoy,

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:14.990
but to motivate it, to put it to problems.
Now supposing you have some problem on a national

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:25.619
basis – you all can put your attention to
that and things will work out. Because you

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:32.619
are the channel of this All-pervading Power
which is trying to create a new world for

00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:40.419
you, new human beings. And this evolution
can take place very fast if you all decide

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:48.859
that whatever we have now within ourselves,
we should motivate it, we should direct it

00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:55.260
and put this attention to some use. It should
not be wasted. Whatever wealth we have, it

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:55.940
should not be wasted.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:02.940
Now the main question today, which I’m going
to tell you about – that, what is God’s

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:13.399
realisation? First is the Self-realisation,
and there are many ambitious people who want

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:16.409
to become God’s realised.

00:26:16.409 --> 00:26:22.300
First and foremost thing, we should know that
human beings cannot become God! It’s not

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:29.300
the becoming of it. You have not become, also,
in a way, Spirit, because the Spirit is emitting

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:36.990
through you, using you, giving you, looking
after you. If you become the Spirit, there

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:45.669
won’t be any body left, nothing will be
left. So with this body intact, your Spirit

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:52.050
is acting through this body, is giving you
all the light.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:58.570
But one cannot become God Almighty, this one
has to understand very clearly. But what is

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:05.570
God’s realisation is to know about God.
You see, to know about God means to know how

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:17.990
His powers are working, how He controls, by
becoming part and parcel of God Almighty.

00:27:23.349 --> 00:27:30.349
Like My finger doesn’t know about My brain,
but it acts according to My brain. The finger

00:27:32.929 --> 00:27:39.929
cannot become the brain, but it has to act
absolutely according to My brain, because

00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:45.700
it is so connected, it is so one.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:52.700
Here, when you have the God’s realisation,
then you know about the brain, you know about

00:27:53.260 --> 00:28:00.260
God, you know about His powers, you know everything
about Him. As far as I am concerned it’s

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:08.879
a difficult task for you, because I’m a
Mahamaya. It’s very difficult for you to

00:28:08.879 --> 00:28:15.879
know each and every thing about Me. I am quite
a illusive person, as you know that well.

00:28:16.419 --> 00:28:23.419
And whatever I do or whatever I achieve, it
is just for you to see and understand that

00:28:24.379 --> 00:28:31.210
– after all this is Adi Shakti, and She
can do all these things. You can also do all

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.820
the things, but you cannot become Me.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:41.820
But you have to know, to know, through love,
through devotion through prayers. To know

00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:52.099
the God’s powers is the way you are God
realised. Then you can control the nature,

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:59.250
you can control everything, if you have that
knowledge within you about God. For that a

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:07.330
complete humility is needed, that you cannot
become God, cannot become God Almighty, you

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:15.230
cannot become the Deities. But definitely,
you can become God realised, Means God acts

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:22.320
through you, uses you as his power, as His
channel, and that you know, that you know,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:29.389
what He’s doing to you, what He’s telling,
what His vision is, and what is the information.

00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:32.280
The connection is like that.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:38.470
Many people in Sahaja Yoga have been benefited,
I know. But they don’t know how they have

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:44.760
been benefited, what has worked it out, how
it has worked it out, what connection of theirs

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:51.760
has helped them. Once you do that, you know
that clearly, how things are working out,

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:59.940
with what power you have achieved it, then
it’s a God’s realisation.

00:30:00.379 --> 00:30:07.379
Such people become extremely powerful, in
the sense that they can control so many things.

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:17.899
There have been many saints of that kind,
but sometimes they fell from even that and

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:26.780
they developed their ego. They didn’t have
their own humility that they should have,

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:33.780
that devotion, that dedication, that surrendering.
They fell down you see them, I have seen some

00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:41.970
of them, that they become quite proud of their
achievements, they don’t want to leave it

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:47.159
to anyone. They think they have achieved it
with great difficulties and why should they

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:54.159
give it to others. Such people are not going
to rise very higher. But you people who have

00:30:54.579 --> 00:31:01.579
got your realisation, and who are humble,
who know that out of humility only you are

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.440
going to achieve your surrendering.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:14.440
Islam means surrender. Mohammed Sahib has
talked about ‘Islam’, meaning ‘You surrender’.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:21.010
If you cannot surrender, you can never know
God. He’s clearly said that unless and until

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.589
you know yourself, you will not know about
God.

00:31:24.589 --> 00:31:31.589
So as sahajis, you have to know all the little,
little things, all the big things, and all

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:42.490
the great visions, that you can do it because
of the grace of God, because [of] His blessings,

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:51.990
because of His love for you, that you have
entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:59.070
I may say you have entered, I may say you
have achieved that state, I may say that,

00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:07.379
but, still you are not there. It’s like
if I tell somebody – “Now you are in Australia.”

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.570
He’s not in Australia, but I can say : ” You
are in Australia” So he believes ” I’m

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:19.770
in Australia”. That’s not the way. You
have to be in Australia, then you have to

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:26.190
know about Australia. You have to know what
sort of a climate it is, what sort of things

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.750
it is.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:34.030
I find also the parents here have to talk
to their children. There’s not much rapport

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:41.030
of the parents with the children. They are
being properly looked after in the school,

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:48.950
and they want to do a lot, but the parents
also must get involved, when the children

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:55.990
come here, to see that they develop proper
discipline, proper sense. Not to get attached

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.609
to them to ruin them. If you get attached,
then you’ll ruin them.

00:33:00.609 --> 00:33:07.609
One of the qualities of Shiva is complete
detachment, and that is what you have to develop,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.159
is to become completely detached.

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:17.440
Detachment doesn’t mean that you neglect
anything.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:24.419
I’ve explained to you many a time that like
the sap in the tree rises, goes to different,

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:30.960
various places and then evaporates or it goes
back to Mother Earth – in the same way your

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:37.510
detachment should be. If you get attached
because it’s your son, or if you get attached

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:44.510
because he’s Australian, or maybe he belongs
to certain family or certain class, then you

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.470
are still limited.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:53.109
All these limitations have to be dropped if
you have to cross over, and these limitations

00:33:53.109 --> 00:34:00.109
create such a big load that whatever I may
try, whatever you may try, you cannot stay

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.000
in thoughtless awareness. That’s a very
beautiful state in which all of you should

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000
be there. In that you are not dominating nor
you are compromising you stand on your own

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:22.750
legs and you know for definite that you are
not swayed away by any idea or any domination

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.760
or any subjection of yours by anyone.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:37.760
So you become completely a free bird, absolutely
free bird and then it becomes your job to

00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:43.339
achieve your flight.

00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:50.339
One flight is up to the thoughtless awareness,
the second one is up to the doubtless awareness,

00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:57.700
and the third one is to God’s realisation.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:04.369
I have seen people who are very close to Me
also don’t understand. They behave in such

00:35:04.369 --> 00:35:09.609
a manner as if now they have become Gods.
So egoistical they are that I’m amazed at

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:14.599
them – then they have to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:21.599
So, you see, even if I praise you too much,
if I say anything to you, you shouldn’t

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:30.920
get pampered. It’s a testing ground. Or
otherwise, also, if I tell you that, “This

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:41.140
is not good, you should improve on this,”
you shouldn’t mind, because I have to do

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:47.750
it, it’s My job, and your job is to listen
to Me, because I’ve nothing to gain from

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.000
you, I do not ask for anything.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:57.000
What I want is you should all get My powers.
You may not become what I am, I agree, but

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:05.339
please try to get all the powers that I have,
which is not a difficult thing.

00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:12.339
This is what is God’s realisation, that’s
what,Ois to know Shiva and Sadashiva. Through

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:20.150
the Shiva, you know Sadashiva. You see the
reflection, and from the reflection, you know

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:28.150
who is the Original, from the reflection you
learn.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:35.150
Thus you reach that state where you think
you are now definitely settled in the Kingdom

00:36:36.089 --> 00:36:43.089
of God, and that you can see God, you can
feel God, you can understand God, and you

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:05.500
can

01:00:10.279 --> 01:00:17.279
love God.
May God bless you
