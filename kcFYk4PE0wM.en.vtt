00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:22.718
Today is the day of worshipping your guru:

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.425
that is your Mother.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:30.742
And as I told you, it’s a very unique
happening

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:34.040
that Mother, Herself, has to become your
Guru.

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:40.510
And also you know that it is a very
difficult task for a Mother to be a guru,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.243
because her love is so overflowing

00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:56.132
that it is difficult for Her to give any
discipline to Her children.

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:58.764
She cannot discipline her own love,

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:02.663
how can she discipline her own children?

00:01:03.212 --> 00:01:10.710
Being [like] that, the responsibility
on the disciples is much more.

00:01:11.301 --> 00:01:19.246
If the guru is a person who can discipline
you

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:30.984
without feeling anything hurting to him,

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:36.916
he is much more capable, and he can do it.

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:45.289
But for a Mother it is a very, very, very
difficult,

00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:58.469
I must say, a very difficult job to be
the guru.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.448
She does not know how to balance,

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.947
and She is extremely forgiving because
She is the Mother.

00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:12.912
While the guru, from the very beginning,
does not forgive.

00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:17.854
But mother, till the end, she’ll go
to the last end.

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:23.099
Even if the child has forsaken her, even
if he has beaten her up,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.410
even if he’s willing to kill her, still she
will be saying that,

00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.750
“My child, are you hurt?”

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.266
Then the responsibility of the disciples is
much more,

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:43.564
to see that they do not hurt Her,

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:46.417
and they do not take my love for granted.

00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:50.715
For they must know that they have
to prove themselves

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.766
and they have to improve themselves.

00:02:56.364 --> 00:03:00.451
That is why this day is a very unique
combination

00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:05.533
of tremendous love overflowing me,

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:13.471
and also the thought, I would say,
the divine inspiration,

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.950
that tells me that you have to be
disciplined.

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:24.712
You have to be disciplined sahaja, not
by another person.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:32.411
That has to be, because if a ship is not
properly tied up

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:39.130
and it is not seaworthy it cannot go very
far.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:51.062
If you want to enjoy the ride in the ocean
of His grace

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:57.096
and compassion, His bliss and kindness,

00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:03.554
then you must build up yourself fully.

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:09.089
Now we have seen we have chakras, and we
can excite them,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.319
we can awaken them by awakening
the Deities.

00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:17.701
But is it not a mechanical process.

00:04:17.902 --> 00:04:21.232
Deity has got a subtle point behind it,

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:26.737
which is a very subtle being within you.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.554
You know them, one by one. And you know
why these chakras are catching —

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:39.250
because you lack that thing.

00:04:40.227 --> 00:04:42.755
There’s nothing to feel bad about it.
As I told you

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:46.645
this is like your motor car outside. This
is your instrument.

00:04:46.846 --> 00:04:52.098
But the instrument has to be properly
harmonised and cleaned.

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:57.417
Today I want certain promises by you
to be made.

00:04:57.618 --> 00:05:00.833
And the foremost of all,

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:07.369
as Christ has said, “Love thy neighbour
as thyself.”

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.702
I would say, one step ahead of that:

00:05:10.903 --> 00:05:17.498
“Love thy neighbour, a Sahaj Yogi, more
than yourself.”

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:28.572
Let us start here. I don’t ask you to do
for the whole universe: among yourselves.

00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:33.583
First of all decide: what have you done
for others?

00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:38.292
Second promise you have to make that you
will never say a harsh word

00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:45.224
to any other sahaj yogi, even if he beats
you hollow.

00:05:46.587 --> 00:05:48.725
You can tell me about it.

00:05:48.926 --> 00:05:52.925
That is the greatest sin you would be
committing from today.

00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:56.463
Don’t try to correct others!

00:05:56.664 --> 00:06:01.055
If he asks you to check him, then tell
that, “This is the thing.”

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:05.950
But do not be harsh! Use your tongue for
saying something sweet.

00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:08.247
I am telling you again and again and again.

00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:12.584
Otherwise I will put some sort of
a restriction on you.

00:06:12.785 --> 00:06:16.095
Try to control your tongue.

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:22.524
It’s very essential to put sweetly
something, you can, you are sahaj yogis,

00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:25.039
it’s very easy to put it sweetly something.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:30.015
It’s such an attractive thing. Why do you
say harsh things?

00:06:30.216 --> 00:06:34.058
For what? To create enemies?

00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:38.032
If you want to have enemies, you can have
so many:

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:41.206
for that you need not say harsh things.

00:06:41.407 --> 00:06:44.856
Very easy to gather enemies. Difficult
to get friends.

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:47.931
And difficult to get your own kith and kin.

00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:52.149
But Sahaj Yogis, you have one Mother.

00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:55.205
And that hurts me the most.

00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:59.213
Any, any, thing that tries to break you

00:06:59.414 --> 00:07:04.011
will take out my heart into many parts.

00:07:04.242 --> 00:07:10.169
And this body will become divided into
many parts.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.272
So don’t do that to me.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:15.743
This is the greatest suffering I can have
from you.

00:07:15.944 --> 00:07:20.625
I request you not to do that because I have
taken you into my Being,

00:07:20.826 --> 00:07:22.730
and you are part and parcel of me.

00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:28.267
You are one of the thousand petals of my
Sahasrara,

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:37.213
and I don’t want these petals to be broken
by you and to be trampled by others.

00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:41.122
You have your own dignity, and respect
the dignity of others.

00:07:41.323 --> 00:07:46.048
And you are Sahaj yogis, realised-souls,
you must know that now.

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:49.447
You are not ordinary people.

00:07:49.813 --> 00:07:53.738
As you respect yourself, you’ll respect
others.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.786
This is one thing I must tell you: that
among yourselves you should be

00:07:58.987 --> 00:08:04.315
very humble and very friendly and
extremely sweet.

00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:07.336
Also when you will start doing that,
gradually you will learn

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:10.899
a method by which you’ll be very sweet.

00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:15.698
It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:20.140
It is better to be beaten up than to be
beating others.

00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:26.232
It is better to be simple and deceived than
to be deceiving others.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:38.171
We are like the shield and the shield has
to fight the sword.

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:42.805
Sword doesn’t fight a sword, it’s a shield
that has to fight it.

00:08:45.675 --> 00:08:49.537
This you must understand, that for
anything,

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:53.155
no harsh words is to be said.

00:08:53.356 --> 00:08:57.060
Keep quiet! Just keep quiet.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.210
Try to keep control of your tongue.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:04.772
That is one thing: that there should be
no disunity

00:09:04.973 --> 00:09:07.325
because you are collectively conscious
among yourselves.

00:09:07.526 --> 00:09:10.674
If there is disunity among you, you cannot
be one:

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:14.142
then how can we think of the whole world
being one? Just think of it!

00:09:14.343 --> 00:09:17.625
And your responsibility is much greater
because you are the first people

00:09:17.826 --> 00:09:25.297
who have got it in the whole of Europe and
the whole of England.

00:09:31.035 --> 00:09:33.369
Respect each other.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.958
Think of the good points that everyone has.
Try to love.

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:46.070
If I were like you… you know I am complete,
I have no problem —

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:52.117
why am I bothering? Because I love you.

00:09:54.955 --> 00:09:57.497
If you love each other, you will see

00:09:57.697 --> 00:10:03.740
the good points of another person, and you
will imbibe them.

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:11.048
Try to love each other. But do not confuse
this love with the carnal love.

00:10:11.249 --> 00:10:15.028
This is Divine love: absolutely pure,

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:20.644
elevating, helping you to ascend.

00:10:21.465 --> 00:10:26.648
Tonight you promise me that you will look

00:10:26.848 --> 00:10:35.624
at every Sahaj Yogi as a person in bondage
in love and not in hatred.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.273
And if somebody you think is not doing
right

00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:42.570
or going bad, then you cure that person.

00:10:42.771 --> 00:10:45.619
Sitting in the house, you know how
to do that.

00:10:45.857 --> 00:10:48.243
But don’t be harsh. By talking ill

00:10:48.444 --> 00:10:52.125
you are not going to do anything to help
that person.

00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:57.703
You use your methods which you know
very well. This is one point.

00:10:57.904 --> 00:11:01.456
And that will give me the greatest
pleasure, the greatest of all:

00:11:01.657 --> 00:11:04.997
when I will see all my children loving each
other,

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:08.800
and being kind to each other, running to do
for everyone,

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:15.304
trying to help each other and extremely
humbled down.

00:11:15.682 --> 00:11:19.275
Some of you are better off, some of you
are more intelligent,

00:11:19.476 --> 00:11:23.548
some of you have got more heart qualities.

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:27.963
Don’t try to show down somebody who lacks
a little bit in intelligence,

00:11:28.164 --> 00:11:30.545
or somebody who has little less of love.

00:11:30.746 --> 00:11:35.108
Maybe that person just wants more love.

00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:39.811
But try to give, than to expect others
to give.

00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:47.039
Then the second one: I want you, all
of you, today, to know

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.272
that you are the people who have to build
up Sahaj Yoga

00:11:50.473 --> 00:11:55.749
in this country and also in other countries
wherever you go.

00:11:55.981 --> 00:12:01.449
So you are like seeds, and the seed which
has to grow the whole tree.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.378
You have to bear all other trees, so how
important you are!

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:08.717
So today you have to resolve that, in your
personal life,

00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:12.999
you are going to be honest. You are going
to watch yourself.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.955
You are going to introspect yourself.
You are not going to tell lies.

00:12:17.156 --> 00:12:19.805
And you are going to look after your
chastity,

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:23.934
look after your life as a very precious
thing.

00:12:24.135 --> 00:12:28.593
And you are not going to cheat yourself.
And you are not going to debase yourself.

00:12:28.794 --> 00:12:32.335
And you are not going to denigrate
yourself, in your own eyes,

00:12:32.536 --> 00:12:37.587
but develop those eyes which criticise
all these things and can see yourself.

00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:41.820
Today you must promise me that you will
meditate,

00:12:42.021 --> 00:12:48.236
you’ll introspect, then getting into your
Self.

00:12:52.723 --> 00:12:56.535
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaj Yog —

00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:59.483
that is God’s own method — at any cost!

00:12:59.684 --> 00:13:01.538
If you do not understand a part of Sahaj
Yog,

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:04.338
you can come and ask me, but don’t
criticise.

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:06.529
This you must promise me.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.422
So far whatever has happened, has happened.

00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:11.015
It’s finished. It’s forgiven.

00:13:11.216 --> 00:13:13.734
But don’t criticise His ways now anymore,

00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:17.744
because now you are put into a higher
position.

00:13:17.944 --> 00:13:21.615
You are put into a higher position, today.

00:13:21.816 --> 00:13:28.210
No more criticism of Sahaj Yog, at any
cost! At any cost.

00:13:28.973 --> 00:13:31.961
Because then you criticise the God Himself.

00:13:33.002 --> 00:13:35.941
If you don’t understand, ask me.

00:13:38.811 --> 00:13:41.226
And now you know you are the people,

00:13:41.426 --> 00:13:46.241
God has sent only those who really know
that Sahaj Yoga is the Truth.

00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:49.804
It is the only way, it is revealed to you
only, very few people,

00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:51.623
that this is the Truth.

00:13:51.824 --> 00:13:55.169
And this is going to save the whole
humanity and all the people.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.550
And God can be only understood through
Sahaj Yog.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.265
So nobody is going to decry Sahaj Yoga.

00:14:03.466 --> 00:14:08.432
Nor anyone is going to say that, “I am
the Sahaj Yoga!”

00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.855
Anybody who thinks like that has been
always, so far, we have seen

00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:18.216
in our practices in Sahaj yoga for the last
now so many years,

00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:21.702
that anyone who takes upon to themselves
that, “I am the Sahaj Yoga!”

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.835
has had the worst possible falls of all
Sahaj Yogis.

00:14:26.264 --> 00:14:29.199
So don’t do that. We are a part and parcel

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.809
of that Sahaj Yoga: harmonising people,
being one with people.

00:14:37.753 --> 00:14:40.987
So nobody should criticise Sahaj Yog,

00:14:41.188 --> 00:14:44.488
nobody should take chances with Sahaj Yog.

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:49.535
And fourth, you have to be obedient to me.

00:14:49.736 --> 00:14:55.332
I have been telling you, in a different way
and in every way

00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:59.409
that you should understand. Now,
this stops.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.750
Today you have done this puja,

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.425
I want to tell you that on your own,
on your free will,

00:15:06.626 --> 00:15:10.336
with your own understanding you have
to be obedient to me.

00:15:10.537 --> 00:15:12.038
This is your own decision.

00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:14.324
I cannot force obedience onto you,

00:15:14.525 --> 00:15:17.515
but you must understand it is for your
good.

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:20.634
Because every minute I can see your
future, I can see

00:15:20.835 --> 00:15:24.056
your past, I can see your ascent, I can see
everything.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.229
If I say anything at that moment, it may
appear

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.910
a little [bit] unreasonable, but just obey
me, what I tell you!

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.669
I am not asking too much, you have seen:
not much, as other gurus do.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.680
You don’t know other gurus what do they do:

00:15:35.881 --> 00:15:40.039
they will hang the disciple in the well
halfway down.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.739
He is just there and from his waist they
will be hanging a rope up.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.766
They take seven parikshas (परीक्षा — trial,
test) like this, horrible ones.

00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:53.456
They will throw him into some place.

00:15:53.657 --> 00:15:57.106
Seven like this. There are, altogether,
108 parikshas.

00:15:57.307 --> 00:16:00.338
And then they say, “Come along!” Then
they will try [to teach] you.

00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:03.924
It starts after that. I am not taking
your test.

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:11.357
But obedience is very necessary because
I know everything.

00:16:11.558 --> 00:16:13.801
I can’t help it. You cannot have

00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:18.196
You cannot have another opinion about
myself because that’s a fact.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:20.934
And if I say something, I would not say
normally,

00:16:21.135 --> 00:16:24.529
I will not hurt you, you know that. I hate
to hurt you.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.116
After any hurt I cause you I weep and cry.

00:16:28.317 --> 00:16:35.557
But I have to do it, because you are my
dearest children and you are my will.

00:16:35.758 --> 00:16:39.843
And you have to do the most important thing
on Earth,

00:16:40.044 --> 00:16:44.003
so be careful. Whatever I have told you,
you have to obey.

00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:52.169
For today, for this place, and today’s
function, I bless you –

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.342
these are the things you must do.

00:16:55.543 --> 00:17:01.055
I haven’t asked for much. But they are very
difficult things.

00:17:01.256 --> 00:17:04.030
They are difficult.

00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:09.429
So, look after yourself. Try to be good
Sahaj Yogis.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.947
Be sweet to each other, kind to each
other. Don’t deceive yourself.

00:17:14.148 --> 00:17:19.225
Look after your vibrations and everything
will be alright.

00:17:26.293 --> 00:17:28.650
May God bless you.
