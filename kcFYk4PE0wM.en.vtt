WEBVTT

00:11.070 --> 00:22.718
Today is the day of worshipping your guru:

00:23.269 --> 00:25.425
that is your Mother.

00:25.626 --> 00:30.742
And as I told you, it’s a very unique
happening

00:30.943 --> 00:34.040
that Mother, Herself, has to become your
Guru.

00:34.241 --> 00:40.510
And also you know that it is a very
difficult task for a Mother to be a guru,

00:40.710 --> 00:49.243
because her love is so overflowing

00:49.444 --> 00:56.132
that it is difficult for Her to give any
discipline to Her children.

00:56.467 --> 00:58.764
She cannot discipline her own love,

00:58.965 --> 01:02.663
how can she discipline her own children?

01:03.212 --> 01:10.710
Being [like] that, the responsibility
on the disciples is much more.

01:11.301 --> 01:19.246
If the guru is a person who can discipline
you

01:19.447 --> 01:30.984
without feeling anything hurting to him,

01:32.093 --> 01:36.916
he is much more capable, and he can do it.

01:37.117 --> 01:45.289
But for a Mother it is a very, very, very
difficult,

01:51.908 --> 01:58.469
I must say, a very difficult job to be
the guru.

01:59.530 --> 02:02.448
She does not know how to balance,

02:02.649 --> 02:07.947
and She is extremely forgiving because
She is the Mother.

02:08.391 --> 02:12.912
While the guru, from the very beginning,
does not forgive.

02:13.113 --> 02:17.854
But mother, till the end, she’ll go
to the last end.

02:18.055 --> 02:23.099
Even if the child has forsaken her, even
if he has beaten her up,

02:23.300 --> 02:28.410
even if he’s willing to kill her, still she
will be saying that,

02:28.611 --> 02:31.750
“My child, are you hurt?”

02:36.390 --> 02:39.266
Then the responsibility of the disciples is
much more,

02:39.466 --> 02:43.564
to see that they do not hurt Her,

02:43.765 --> 02:46.417
and they do not take my love for granted.

02:46.618 --> 02:50.715
For they must know that they have
to prove themselves

02:51.490 --> 02:54.766
and they have to improve themselves.

02:56.364 --> 03:00.451
That is why this day is a very unique
combination

03:00.652 --> 03:05.533
of tremendous love overflowing me,

03:05.734 --> 03:13.471
and also the thought, I would say,
the divine inspiration,

03:13.709 --> 03:17.950
that tells me that you have to be
disciplined.

03:18.982 --> 03:24.712
You have to be disciplined sahaja, not
by another person.

03:24.913 --> 03:32.411
That has to be, because if a ship is not
properly tied up

03:32.612 --> 03:39.130
and it is not seaworthy it cannot go very
far.

03:41.350 --> 03:51.062
If you want to enjoy the ride in the ocean
of His grace

03:51.263 --> 03:57.096
and compassion, His bliss and kindness,

03:57.297 --> 04:03.554
then you must build up yourself fully.

04:04.803 --> 04:09.089
Now we have seen we have chakras, and we
can excite them,

04:09.290 --> 04:14.319
we can awaken them by awakening
the Deities.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.701
But is it not a mechanical process.

04:17.902 --> 04:21.232
Deity has got a subtle point behind it,

04:21.433 --> 04:26.737
which is a very subtle being within you.

04:30.770 --> 04:35.554
You know them, one by one. And you know
why these chakras are catching —

04:35.755 --> 04:39.250
because you lack that thing.

04:40.227 --> 04:42.755
There’s nothing to feel bad about it.
As I told you

04:42.956 --> 04:46.645
this is like your motor car outside. This
is your instrument.

04:46.846 --> 04:52.098
But the instrument has to be properly
harmonised and cleaned.

04:52.934 --> 04:57.417
Today I want certain promises by you
to be made.

04:57.618 --> 05:00.833
And the foremost of all,

05:03.579 --> 05:07.369
as Christ has said, “Love thy neighbour
as thyself.”

05:07.570 --> 05:10.702
I would say, one step ahead of that:

05:10.903 --> 05:17.498
“Love thy neighbour, a Sahaj Yogi, more
than yourself.”

05:21.756 --> 05:28.572
Let us start here. I don’t ask you to do
for the whole universe: among yourselves.

05:29.398 --> 05:33.583
First of all decide: what have you done
for others?

05:33.908 --> 05:38.292
Second promise you have to make that you
will never say a harsh word

05:38.493 --> 05:45.224
to any other sahaj yogi, even if he beats
you hollow.

05:46.587 --> 05:48.725
You can tell me about it.

05:48.926 --> 05:52.925
That is the greatest sin you would be
committing from today.

05:53.126 --> 05:56.463
Don’t try to correct others!

05:56.664 --> 06:01.055
If he asks you to check him, then tell
that, “This is the thing.”

06:01.867 --> 06:05.950
But do not be harsh! Use your tongue for
saying something sweet.

06:06.151 --> 06:08.247
I am telling you again and again and again.

06:08.448 --> 06:12.584
Otherwise I will put some sort of
a restriction on you.

06:12.785 --> 06:16.095
Try to control your tongue.

06:17.589 --> 06:22.524
It’s very essential to put sweetly
something, you can, you are sahaj yogis,

06:22.725 --> 06:25.039
it’s very easy to put it sweetly something.

06:25.239 --> 06:30.015
It’s such an attractive thing. Why do you
say harsh things?

06:30.216 --> 06:34.058
For what? To create enemies?

06:35.838 --> 06:38.032
If you want to have enemies, you can have
so many:

06:38.233 --> 06:41.206
for that you need not say harsh things.

06:41.407 --> 06:44.856
Very easy to gather enemies. Difficult
to get friends.

06:45.057 --> 06:47.931
And difficult to get your own kith and kin.

06:48.132 --> 06:52.149
But Sahaj Yogis, you have one Mother.

06:53.095 --> 06:55.205
And that hurts me the most.

06:55.406 --> 06:59.213
Any, any, thing that tries to break you

06:59.414 --> 07:04.011
will take out my heart into many parts.

07:04.242 --> 07:10.169
And this body will become divided into
many parts.

07:10.370 --> 07:12.272
So don’t do that to me.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.743
This is the greatest suffering I can have
from you.

07:15.944 --> 07:20.625
I request you not to do that because I have
taken you into my Being,

07:20.826 --> 07:22.730
and you are part and parcel of me.

07:22.931 --> 07:28.267
You are one of the thousand petals of my
Sahasrara,

07:28.468 --> 07:37.213
and I don’t want these petals to be broken
by you and to be trampled by others.

07:37.414 --> 07:41.122
You have your own dignity, and respect
the dignity of others.

07:41.323 --> 07:46.048
And you are Sahaj yogis, realised-souls,
you must know that now.

07:46.249 --> 07:49.447
You are not ordinary people.

07:49.813 --> 07:53.738
As you respect yourself, you’ll respect
others.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.786
This is one thing I must tell you: that
among yourselves you should be

07:58.987 --> 08:04.315
very humble and very friendly and
extremely sweet.

08:04.516 --> 08:07.336
Also when you will start doing that,
gradually you will learn

08:07.537 --> 08:10.899
a method by which you’ll be very sweet.

08:11.113 --> 08:15.698
It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.

08:15.899 --> 08:20.140
It is better to be beaten up than to be
beating others.

08:20.341 --> 08:26.232
It is better to be simple and deceived than
to be deceiving others.

08:32.137 --> 08:38.171
We are like the shield and the shield has
to fight the sword.

08:38.372 --> 08:42.805
Sword doesn’t fight a sword, it’s a shield
that has to fight it.

08:45.675 --> 08:49.537
This you must understand, that for
anything,

08:49.738 --> 08:53.155
no harsh words is to be said.

08:53.356 --> 08:57.060
Keep quiet! Just keep quiet.

08:57.260 --> 09:01.210
Try to keep control of your tongue.

09:01.507 --> 09:04.772
That is one thing: that there should be
no disunity

09:04.973 --> 09:07.325
because you are collectively conscious
among yourselves.

09:07.526 --> 09:10.674
If there is disunity among you, you cannot
be one:

09:10.875 --> 09:14.142
then how can we think of the whole world
being one? Just think of it!

09:14.343 --> 09:17.625
And your responsibility is much greater
because you are the first people

09:17.826 --> 09:25.297
who have got it in the whole of Europe and
the whole of England.

09:31.035 --> 09:33.369
Respect each other.

09:33.570 --> 09:38.958
Think of the good points that everyone has.
Try to love.

09:39.159 --> 09:46.070
If I were like you… you know I am complete,
I have no problem —

09:46.333 --> 09:52.117
why am I bothering? Because I love you.

09:54.955 --> 09:57.497
If you love each other, you will see

09:57.697 --> 10:03.740
the good points of another person, and you
will imbibe them.

10:05.321 --> 10:11.048
Try to love each other. But do not confuse
this love with the carnal love.

10:11.249 --> 10:15.028
This is Divine love: absolutely pure,

10:15.229 --> 10:20.644
elevating, helping you to ascend.

10:21.465 --> 10:26.648
Tonight you promise me that you will look

10:26.848 --> 10:35.624
at every Sahaj Yogi as a person in bondage
in love and not in hatred.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.273
And if somebody you think is not doing
right

10:39.474 --> 10:42.570
or going bad, then you cure that person.

10:42.771 --> 10:45.619
Sitting in the house, you know how
to do that.

10:45.857 --> 10:48.243
But don’t be harsh. By talking ill

10:48.444 --> 10:52.125
you are not going to do anything to help
that person.

10:52.831 --> 10:57.703
You use your methods which you know
very well. This is one point.

10:57.904 --> 11:01.456
And that will give me the greatest
pleasure, the greatest of all:

11:01.657 --> 11:04.997
when I will see all my children loving each
other,

11:05.198 --> 11:08.800
and being kind to each other, running to do
for everyone,

11:09.001 --> 11:15.304
trying to help each other and extremely
humbled down.

11:15.682 --> 11:19.275
Some of you are better off, some of you
are more intelligent,

11:19.476 --> 11:23.548
some of you have got more heart qualities.

11:23.749 --> 11:27.963
Don’t try to show down somebody who lacks
a little bit in intelligence,

11:28.164 --> 11:30.545
or somebody who has little less of love.

11:30.746 --> 11:35.108
Maybe that person just wants more love.

11:35.346 --> 11:39.811
But try to give, than to expect others
to give.

11:41.042 --> 11:47.039
Then the second one: I want you, all
of you, today, to know

11:47.240 --> 11:50.272
that you are the people who have to build
up Sahaj Yoga

11:50.473 --> 11:55.749
in this country and also in other countries
wherever you go.

11:55.981 --> 12:01.449
So you are like seeds, and the seed which
has to grow the whole tree.

12:01.650 --> 12:05.378
You have to bear all other trees, so how
important you are!

12:05.579 --> 12:08.717
So today you have to resolve that, in your
personal life,

12:08.918 --> 12:12.999
you are going to be honest. You are going
to watch yourself.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.955
You are going to introspect yourself.
You are not going to tell lies.

12:17.156 --> 12:19.805
And you are going to look after your
chastity,

12:20.006 --> 12:23.934
look after your life as a very precious
thing.

12:24.135 --> 12:28.593
And you are not going to cheat yourself.
And you are not going to debase yourself.

12:28.794 --> 12:32.335
And you are not going to denigrate
yourself, in your own eyes,

12:32.536 --> 12:37.587
but develop those eyes which criticise
all these things and can see yourself.

12:37.788 --> 12:41.820
Today you must promise me that you will
meditate,

12:42.021 --> 12:48.236
you’ll introspect, then getting into your
Self.

12:52.723 --> 12:56.535
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaj Yog —

12:56.736 --> 12:59.483
that is God’s own method — at any cost!

12:59.684 --> 13:01.538
If you do not understand a part of Sahaj
Yog,

13:01.739 --> 13:04.338
you can come and ask me, but don’t
criticise.

13:04.539 --> 13:06.529
This you must promise me.

13:06.730 --> 13:09.422
So far whatever has happened, has happened.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.015
It’s finished. It’s forgiven.

13:11.216 --> 13:13.734
But don’t criticise His ways now anymore,

13:13.935 --> 13:17.744
because now you are put into a higher
position.

13:17.944 --> 13:21.615
You are put into a higher position, today.

13:21.816 --> 13:28.210
No more criticism of Sahaj Yog, at any
cost! At any cost.

13:28.973 --> 13:31.961
Because then you criticise the God Himself.

13:33.002 --> 13:35.941
If you don’t understand, ask me.

13:38.811 --> 13:41.226
And now you know you are the people,

13:41.426 --> 13:46.241
God has sent only those who really know
that Sahaj Yoga is the Truth.

13:46.442 --> 13:49.804
It is the only way, it is revealed to you
only, very few people,

13:50.005 --> 13:51.623
that this is the Truth.

13:51.824 --> 13:55.169
And this is going to save the whole
humanity and all the people.

13:55.370 --> 13:59.550
And God can be only understood through
Sahaj Yog.

13:59.750 --> 14:03.265
So nobody is going to decry Sahaj Yoga.

14:03.466 --> 14:08.432
Nor anyone is going to say that, “I am
the Sahaj Yoga!”

14:09.611 --> 14:13.855
Anybody who thinks like that has been
always, so far, we have seen

14:14.055 --> 14:18.216
in our practices in Sahaj yoga for the last
now so many years,

14:18.417 --> 14:21.702
that anyone who takes upon to themselves
that, “I am the Sahaj Yoga!”

14:21.903 --> 14:25.835
has had the worst possible falls of all
Sahaj Yogis.

14:26.264 --> 14:29.199
So don’t do that. We are a part and parcel

14:29.400 --> 14:34.809
of that Sahaj Yoga: harmonising people,
being one with people.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.987
So nobody should criticise Sahaj Yog,

14:41.188 --> 14:44.488
nobody should take chances with Sahaj Yog.

14:44.689 --> 14:49.535
And fourth, you have to be obedient to me.

14:49.736 --> 14:55.332
I have been telling you, in a different way
and in every way

14:55.533 --> 14:59.409
that you should understand. Now,
this stops.

14:59.610 --> 15:01.750
Today you have done this puja,

15:01.950 --> 15:06.425
I want to tell you that on your own,
on your free will,

15:06.626 --> 15:10.336
with your own understanding you have
to be obedient to me.

15:10.537 --> 15:12.038
This is your own decision.

15:12.238 --> 15:14.324
I cannot force obedience onto you,

15:14.525 --> 15:17.515
but you must understand it is for your
good.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.634
Because every minute I can see your
future, I can see

15:20.835 --> 15:24.056
your past, I can see your ascent, I can see
everything.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.229
If I say anything at that moment, it may
appear

15:26.430 --> 15:29.910
a little [bit] unreasonable, but just obey
me, what I tell you!

15:30.110 --> 15:33.669
I am not asking too much, you have seen:
not much, as other gurus do.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.680
You don’t know other gurus what do they do:

15:35.881 --> 15:40.039
they will hang the disciple in the well
halfway down.

15:40.240 --> 15:46.739
He is just there and from his waist they
will be hanging a rope up.

15:46.940 --> 15:49.766
They take seven parikshas (परीक्षा — trial,
test) like this, horrible ones.

15:49.967 --> 15:53.456
They will throw him into some place.

15:53.657 --> 15:57.106
Seven like this. There are, altogether,
108 parikshas.

15:57.307 --> 16:00.338
And then they say, “Come along!” Then
they will try [to teach] you.

16:00.539 --> 16:03.924
It starts after that. I am not taking
your test.

16:04.125 --> 16:11.357
But obedience is very necessary because
I know everything.

16:11.558 --> 16:13.801
I can’t help it. You cannot have

16:14.002 --> 16:18.196
You cannot have another opinion about
myself because that’s a fact.

16:18.399 --> 16:20.934
And if I say something, I would not say
normally,

16:21.135 --> 16:24.529
I will not hurt you, you know that. I hate
to hurt you.

16:24.730 --> 16:28.116
After any hurt I cause you I weep and cry.

16:28.317 --> 16:35.557
But I have to do it, because you are my
dearest children and you are my will.

16:35.758 --> 16:39.843
And you have to do the most important thing
on Earth,

16:40.044 --> 16:44.003
so be careful. Whatever I have told you,
you have to obey.

16:44.204 --> 16:52.169
For today, for this place, and today’s
function, I bless you –

16:52.370 --> 16:55.342
these are the things you must do.

16:55.543 --> 17:01.055
I haven’t asked for much. But they are very
difficult things.

17:01.256 --> 17:04.030
They are difficult.

17:04.361 --> 17:09.429
So, look after yourself. Try to be good
Sahaj Yogis.

17:09.630 --> 17:13.947
Be sweet to each other, kind to each
other. Don’t deceive yourself.

17:14.148 --> 17:19.225
Look after your vibrations and everything
will be alright.

17:26.293 --> 17:28.650
May God bless you.
