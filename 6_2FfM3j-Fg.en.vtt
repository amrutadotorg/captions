00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.020
So far they were human beings at a lower level of existence,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.540
and they had all the problems of that level,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.020
is that jealousies, hatred-

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.500
all kinds of problems that are today of fighting,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.980
of troubling others,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.540
destroying others and not loving others.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.780
All these problems existed because

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.540
their Sahasrara was not opened.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.100
So our main problem is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.340
to open the Sahasrara of the people all over the world-

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.220
which is very simple, which you can all do it,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.940
and it will work better if you do it collectively.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.180
If you are collective you can work it out very well.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.660
Like that in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.820
whose Sahasrara was completely opened,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.140
and they felt their depth.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.660
Firstly, you must feel your depth.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.780
If you don’t feel your depth

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.540
and you are not one with your personality which is so deep,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.780
then you cannot enjoy the Self-Realization.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.180
First of all you should understand yourself.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.420
If you don't understand yourself,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.140
how can you understand other people?

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.540
You cannot.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.300
So first this Sahasrara should be opened out fully.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.780
“Fully” means complete oneness with the Divine.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.420
That is not difficult.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.740
Only you have to meditate little bit

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.861
and then it will work out.

00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:02.620
It has worked out in many people

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.940
I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.060
who have achieved such a lot of collectivity

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.327
and also the awareness of a realized soul.

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:21.127
Even after realization I find people have a problem.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:25.607
They still have the problem of the past life which is finished,

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:29.167
it’s dead, but they still carry on with that

00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:33.368
and the consciousness, so much of illumination also

00:02:33.448 --> 00:02:35.847
doesn’t show what’s wrong with them.

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:39.727
For example, take the case of ego.

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:42.047
Ego is so developed.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:45.087
In the Western countries where they are so developed,

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.127
ego has also developed,

00:02:47.207 --> 00:02:51.167
and they have to find out what’s wrong with them.

00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:56.967
This ego comes from certain consciousness

00:02:57.047 --> 00:02:59.847
that you have been something great,

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.207
you are this, you are that,

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:06.527
your parents have been great maybe, your property is great

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:11.247
or maybe you are occupying very big position, or anything.

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:12.847
It can come from anything,

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:18.127
and this consciousness is against your awareness

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:20.447
because it’s not true.

00:03:20.527 --> 00:03:25.847
You are not anything being molded by these outside things,

00:03:25.927 --> 00:03:33.607
but you are molded by your own awareness within yourself.

00:03:34.287 --> 00:03:36.847
This awareness has to grow.

00:03:36.927 --> 00:03:39.727
From where? – is to understand

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:43.447
how do we get this ego, from what point.

00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:46.087
Yesterday I felt there were lots of people

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:49.527
who were having a lot of right side on them.

00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:51.767
This right side is of no help.

00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:55.447
It will create problems for you, sickness for you,

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:59.487
and also no use having right-sided Sahaja yogis.

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:04.887
So the main thing is to understand the power of love.

00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:08.327
Power of love is the highest and the greatest,

00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:13.687
and if you can manage somehow or other to give up your anger,

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:18.767
give up your greed and also your ego

00:04:18.847 --> 00:04:22.767
if you can do that, you can be in Sahasrara.

00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:25.847
Now just see the sport of ego.

00:04:25.927 --> 00:04:29.207
It stops your ascent further.

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:31.847
At ego only people get lost,

00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:35.927
because at ego only they move to the left or to the right

00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:40.527
and they can go to the too much of right side,

00:04:40.607 --> 00:04:43.207
or can go up to the left side.

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:48.447
They can go to any extreme of these two.

00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:52.247
So first of all we have to correct our ego.

00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:55.087
For this ego, what should we do?

00:04:55.167 --> 00:05:00.127
For this ego we should watch ourselves and laugh at ourselves.

00:05:00.207 --> 00:05:03.207
What ego do we have, of what?

00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:09.127
We are human beings, now have become divine.

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:15.287
And with divine within us, with this light within us

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:20.007
we have to understand that we are a part and parcel of the Divine,

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:23.727
just a drop in the ocean of love.

00:05:23.807 --> 00:05:26.727
If you can reduce your ego,

00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:32.807
if you can bring it to the actual sense of your being,

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:35.647
then it will work out better.

00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:42.807
I find it in the West, this ego is very strong – very, very strong.

00:05:42.887 --> 00:05:45.887
And whatever they do wrong they think is correct,

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:49.047
because ego can support you in every way.

00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:52.287
While on the contrary those people who are developing,

00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:54.607
the countries who are not yet developed,

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:59.647
there the people, problem is not of ego but of superego.

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:01.527
That can be corrected.

00:06:01.607 --> 00:06:05.247
But ego is your own enemy created by you.

00:06:05.327 --> 00:06:07.247
So you have to fight it,

00:06:07.327 --> 00:06:10.967
and see for yourself from where it is coming.

00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:14.647
It might be country-wise, it might be family-wise,

00:06:14.727 --> 00:06:16.607
it can be from anywhere.

00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:19.808
So first of all we must watch out for the ego,

00:06:19.888 --> 00:06:24.107
if it is Sahasrara we have to enter into.

00:06:24.187 --> 00:06:29.587
So main thing is how to watch and witness your ego-

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:33.387
how it works, how it spoils your temperament,

00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:35.707
how it spoils your relationships,

00:06:35.787 --> 00:06:38.867
how it makes you stupid.

00:06:38.947 --> 00:06:42.708
Ego is, first thing it does is to make you very stupid,

00:06:42.788 --> 00:06:46.707
and you start behaving in such a manner that people start thinking that

00:06:46.787 --> 00:06:51.267
Oh, you are the great, stupidest person ever living.”

00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:53.307
But it is of no help

00:06:53.387 --> 00:06:56.627
because if they believe that you are a stupid person,

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:58.067
what will happen?

00:06:58.147 --> 00:07:00.827
On the contrary if you have the wisdom,

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.147
if you have that peace,

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:05.427
if you have that special temperament

00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:09.227
of enjoying everything in life

00:07:09.307 --> 00:07:12.667
and also the collective temperament,

00:07:12.747 --> 00:07:15.307
it will work out. They will be impressed,

00:07:15.387 --> 00:07:21.227
because in that light they can see their own stupidity,

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:24.266
own falsehood, everything,

00:07:24.346 --> 00:07:28.827
and they will realize that what they think is not true.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.307
“This gentleman is much deeper than me.

00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:35.387
What he has got, I haven’t got it.”

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:38.596
This is the main thing for all of us.

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:42.676
First of all you should be model, models of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:45.476
And that is what I have been always telling you

00:07:45.556 --> 00:07:48.196
that get rid of your ego.

00:07:48.276 --> 00:07:52.236
It’s the worst thing, because first of all it brings anger.

00:07:52.316 --> 00:07:54.556
You think you are something great

00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:56.596
and you can do this, you can do that

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:59.236
because you are a Sahaja yogi- it´s not true.

00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:03.396
On the contrary you become extremely humble, extremely humble,

00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:05.316
and you do right things.

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:10.196
You do not become any more, any more, arrogant

00:08:10.876 --> 00:08:14.236
and also full of anger.

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:17.876
Anger departs from you completely, completely.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.556
It gives you a balance, it gives you wisdom

00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:25.596
by which you see what is your job, why are you on this earth,

00:08:25.676 --> 00:08:28.156
why this energy has come to you,

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:30.836
why you are a divine personality.

00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:34.476
It’s a very, very great responsibility.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.796
You don’t have to look after yourself, no.

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:41.676
The Divine will look after you, absolutely.

00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:45.156
It will protect you, it will look after you,

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:47.916
it will do whatever is needed for you.

00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:52.876
But in case, in case you have this ego,

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:57.076
you shut out yourself from the reality, from the truth,

00:08:57.156 --> 00:09:03.196
and you become very hot-tempered and arrogant personality.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.036
This has to go away.

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:10.356
Sahaja yogis are saints- not saints but they are more than saints

00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:13.276
because they can express themselves better.

00:09:13.356 --> 00:09:16.956
They have powers in them which they can utilize,

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:21.956
which they can show to other people that you are so powerful,

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:28.356
that you can manage things much better than what you think.

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:31.516
For example, say there’s a problem

00:09:31.596 --> 00:09:34.396
and the whole world is upset about it.

00:09:34.476 --> 00:09:38.996
Only thing if you know how to witness it, it will disappear,

00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:41.396
it will disappear in the whole world.

00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:43.236
It cannot remain there.

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:47.596
So nowadays the world is full of turmoil as you see,

00:09:47.676 --> 00:09:50.596
full of nonsensical people coming up,

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:57.476
full of quarrelsome people, dominating people are overpowering.

00:09:57.556 --> 00:10:01.836
At this time if you just see this in the witness state,

00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:03.436
this will disappear.

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:06.116
Because very powerful you are, very powerful,

00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:08.076
but you must know first of all

00:10:08.156 --> 00:10:11.916
that you must have the equipment to use the power.

00:10:12.556 --> 00:10:16.076
If you have that equipment within you, you can do it.

00:10:16.156 --> 00:10:19.596
But with your ego you cannot.

00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:23.476
Ego is the greatest hurdle for your ascent.

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.836
You see that ego is at a place

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:31.716
where you have to just cross to go to Sahasrara.

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:35.116
And to break Sahasrara is very easy otherwise,

00:10:35.196 --> 00:10:40.246
but if there is ego you are already lost in that ego.

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:43.566
Look at Me, I am an ordinary housewife otherwise,

00:10:43.646 --> 00:10:46.526
but how it has worked all over the world.

00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:50.006
By what? By just the power of love.

00:10:50.086 --> 00:10:53.366
Only trouble is that I can use My power of love,

00:10:53.446 --> 00:10:56.566
but you don’t know how to use. That's the only problem.

00:10:56.646 --> 00:10:58.806
If you want to use your power of love,

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:02.606
in meditation you can develop that power of love.

00:11:02.686 --> 00:11:08.206
With that you can capture people, with that you can understand.

00:11:08.286 --> 00:11:11.766
Their problems are that they are not Sahaja yogis,

00:11:11.846 --> 00:11:17.606
they are not the people who are having all the blessings

00:11:17.686 --> 00:11:19.606
or the connection with the Divine.

00:11:19.686 --> 00:11:22.246
Imagine, you are connected with Divine.

00:11:22.326 --> 00:11:24.886
And Divine is such a great thing

00:11:24.966 --> 00:11:27.126
which has created this whole universe,

00:11:27.206 --> 00:11:30.727
created you, and have done all the great jobs.

00:11:30.807 --> 00:11:34.846
So what are you? You are a part 
and parcel of that divine Power,

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:39.606
so why not we use our divine Power fully within us

00:11:39.686 --> 00:11:42.966
with love and with understanding

00:11:43.046 --> 00:11:45.966
so that you develop this wisdom within you.

00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:48.486
This is what is to be told to yourself,

00:11:48.566 --> 00:11:50.606
that “We are realized souls.”

00:11:50.686 --> 00:11:56.166
This one is something, a personality special, very much special.

00:11:56.246 --> 00:11:59.726
In this world there were very few people who are realized souls,

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:02.366
but now we have so many, I can see them.

00:12:02.446 --> 00:12:07.086
But still if it’s lacking in … some problems are there

00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:09.503
because of our ego.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:15.623
So our ego has to be seen, is to be watched in witness state,

00:12:15.703 --> 00:12:22.223
how it works
and how it tries to dissuade us

00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:25.882
from the right path of movement.

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:28.663
One has to be only careful on that point,

00:12:28.743 --> 00:12:33.623
because that’s the last center which has to be opened out.

00:12:33.703 --> 00:12:38.703
Once it is completely open, you are one with the Divine

00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:41.243
and your all problems will be solved,

00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:45.983
because these problems are so frivolous and has no meaning.

00:12:46.063 --> 00:12:48.744
They’ll go away in no time, as long

00:12:48.824 --> 00:12:52.543
as you work it out, your Sahasrara.

00:12:52.623 --> 00:12:56.423
It’s very nice that today is a very special day

00:12:56.503 --> 00:13:00.663
with all these three stars are coming together,

00:13:00.743 --> 00:13:03.623
and it’s special blessing.

00:13:05.903 --> 00:13:11.743
If your powers increase, all these people who are very bad,

00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:14.464
who are trying to capture the society

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.303
with their political nonsense and all that,

00:13:17.383 --> 00:13:18.743
they all will disappear.

00:13:18.823 --> 00:13:21.703
They have no powers, they’ll all disappear.

00:13:21.783 --> 00:13:26.264
So, first of all your egoless nature will help,

00:13:26.344 --> 00:13:28.063
will help everyone.

00:13:28.143 --> 00:13:30.263
May God bless you all.
