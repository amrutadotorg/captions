00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:13.476
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:23.725
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:33.007
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:39.742
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:46.703
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:56.490
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.121
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:09.709
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.029
And for that I have a plan.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.032
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:28.182
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:35.189
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.146
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

00:01:40.347 --> 00:01:44.146
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:52.535
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

00:01:52.822 --> 00:02:00.632
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:10.171
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:15.763
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:19.907
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:28.062
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:31.877
But not only in England, same in Paris:

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:37.089
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.666
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.495
This madness is on and on and on.

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:53.176
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:58.032
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:03.570
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:11.593
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

00:03:11.794 --> 00:03:18.166
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:20.867
of these useless things?

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:24.469
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.734
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:36.144
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

00:03:36.344 --> 00:03:41.285
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:48.953
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:51.762
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

00:03:51.963 --> 00:03:55.679
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.853
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:10.441
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:16.854
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:27.420
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:35.562
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

00:04:35.763 --> 00:04:39.003
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

00:04:39.204 --> 00:04:43.324
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:48.838
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.775
So, it is against you.

00:04:51.976 --> 00:05:01.150
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:06.944
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:10.805
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:21.542
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.837
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:30.778
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.129
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:43.182
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:50.013
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

00:05:50.214 --> 00:05:54.924
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

00:05:55.202 --> 00:06:04.670
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:08.342
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

00:06:08.543 --> 00:06:13.705
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

00:06:13.884 --> 00:06:19.708
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:25.504
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:30.837
Because wisdom itself shows

00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:37.102
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:42.636
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:46.813
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:52.927
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

00:06:53.128 --> 00:07:02.161
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

00:07:02.362 --> 00:07:06.212
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

00:07:06.413 --> 00:07:10.977
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

00:07:11.178 --> 00:07:15.118
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:20.907
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:25.131
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

00:07:25.332 --> 00:07:31.082
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:34.912
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

00:07:35.113 --> 00:07:40.500
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:45.398
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:51.699
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.987
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:03.724
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:09.683
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

00:08:09.847 --> 00:08:17.428
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:22.862
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

00:08:23.063 --> 00:08:25.648
Evening time the car used to come,

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:32.233
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:38.291
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

00:08:38.492 --> 00:08:45.584
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:49.815
At the most you can see some lamppost.

00:08:50.016 --> 00:08:55.797
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

00:08:55.997 --> 00:09:02.861
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:10.681
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

00:09:10.864 --> 00:09:15.943
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

00:09:16.144 --> 00:09:20.213
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

00:09:20.414 --> 00:09:26.726
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.264
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

00:09:33.465 --> 00:09:37.931
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

00:09:38.132 --> 00:09:42.933
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

00:09:43.778 --> 00:09:48.411
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

00:09:48.612 --> 00:09:55.058
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

00:09:55.799 --> 00:10:04.359
Now see what has happened in, say,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.856
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:15.848
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:19.102
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

00:10:19.303 --> 00:10:24.160
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

00:10:24.882 --> 00:10:29.643
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

00:10:29.844 --> 00:10:38.118
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

00:10:38.319 --> 00:10:44.123
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:48.529
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:54.400
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:11:00.169
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:03.081
And it’s all working out everywhere.

00:11:03.282 --> 00:11:08.590
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:15.858
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:20.600
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

00:11:20.801 --> 00:11:26.489
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.241
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:33.196
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

00:11:33.397 --> 00:11:37.923
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

00:11:38.124 --> 00:11:42.824
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:51.037
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

00:11:51.238 --> 00:11:54.088
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

00:11:54.289 --> 00:12:00.103
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:06.712
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:11.432
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:18.492
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

00:12:18.693 --> 00:12:28.815
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:34.527
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

00:12:34.728 --> 00:12:37.074
So many have lost their money there,

00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:39.806
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

00:12:40.007 --> 00:12:44.227
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:53.272
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

00:12:54.169 --> 00:13:05.181
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:12.609
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:18.232
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:25.495
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:31.715
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

00:13:31.916 --> 00:13:37.001
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

00:13:37.202 --> 00:13:46.587
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

00:13:46.788 --> 00:13:49.738
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:54.332
because I spent money on My family things
also.

00:13:54.533 --> 00:14:01.544
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

00:14:01.727 --> 00:14:05.629
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:12.463
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

00:14:12.664 --> 00:14:19.782
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

00:14:19.983 --> 00:14:23.610
Joy is much more in giving to others.

00:14:23.811 --> 00:14:32.099
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:38.015
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

00:14:38.216 --> 00:14:45.983
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

00:14:46.184 --> 00:14:58.631
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:03.654
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

00:15:03.855 --> 00:15:08.063
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

00:15:08.264 --> 00:15:12.847
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

00:15:13.048 --> 00:15:16.953
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

00:15:17.154 --> 00:15:22.509
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.110
At least, there should be some embroidery,

00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:29.715
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

00:15:29.921 --> 00:15:34.313
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

00:15:34.514 --> 00:15:37.274
they are injurious to our health.

00:15:37.475 --> 00:15:42.614
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:47.622
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:53.368
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:56.752
how many of you know?

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:09.655
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

00:16:09.856 --> 00:16:13.945
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

00:16:14.146 --> 00:16:21.025
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:24.309
From where does this sari comes?

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:30.291
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

00:16:30.492 --> 00:16:34.558
But even western men also have the same
problem.

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:38.817
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

00:16:39.013 --> 00:16:43.294
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:46.741
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

00:16:46.942 --> 00:16:51.116
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

00:16:51.317 --> 00:16:57.512
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

00:16:59.176 --> 00:17:05.261
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

00:17:07.154 --> 00:17:14.448
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:20.571
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

00:17:20.772 --> 00:17:24.497
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

00:17:24.698 --> 00:17:28.428
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

00:17:28.629 --> 00:17:33.884
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:41.352
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

00:17:41.553 --> 00:17:48.263
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

00:17:48.464 --> 00:17:55.331
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:58.603
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

00:17:58.764 --> 00:18:02.615
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:09.333
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:14.561
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

00:18:14.762 --> 00:18:19.905
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

00:18:20.106 --> 00:18:26.939
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:33.421
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

00:18:33.622 --> 00:18:38.929
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.808
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

00:18:42.009 --> 00:18:46.071
this is red but it has green to match it.

00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:49.770
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:55.001
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:59.589
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.576
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.287
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

00:19:07.488 --> 00:19:10.501
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:14.620
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.931
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:24.292
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

00:19:24.493 --> 00:19:28.111
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:31.588
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

00:19:31.802 --> 00:19:37.152
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

00:19:37.353 --> 00:19:44.015
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:51.149
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.753
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

00:19:54.954 --> 00:19:58.370
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

00:19:58.571 --> 00:20:02.639
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.021
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

00:20:07.222 --> 00:20:12.340
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:17.764
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

00:20:17.965 --> 00:20:22.010
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

00:20:22.211 --> 00:20:25.969
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.983
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

00:20:30.184 --> 00:20:32.962
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

00:20:33.163 --> 00:20:36.038
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:42.383
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:47.064
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:53.182
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

00:20:53.383 --> 00:20:56.200
I sold one of My ornaments

00:20:56.401 --> 00:21:01.096
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

00:21:01.296 --> 00:21:05.605
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:16.550
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

00:21:17.177 --> 00:21:22.660
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

00:21:22.874 --> 00:21:28.316
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

00:21:29.604 --> 00:21:37.739
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

00:21:40.046 --> 00:21:43.260
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
but I am missing him

00:21:43.461 --> 00:21:48.765
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

00:21:48.966 --> 00:21:51.445
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:57.269
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:03.447
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

00:22:03.648 --> 00:22:08.159
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:14.611
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

00:22:17.012 --> 00:22:20.684
These small, small things can give you
great joy

00:22:20.885 --> 00:22:26.765
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

00:22:26.966 --> 00:22:31.548
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

00:22:31.749 --> 00:22:34.030
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

00:22:34.231 --> 00:22:38.348
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:42.691
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

00:22:42.892 --> 00:22:46.166
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

00:22:46.367 --> 00:22:53.550
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:57.480
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

00:22:57.681 --> 00:23:00.384
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

00:23:00.585 --> 00:23:05.256
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

00:23:05.457 --> 00:23:10.186
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

00:23:10.387 --> 00:23:15.739
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.101
I don’t even have time to see them.

00:23:21.008 --> 00:23:27.657
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

00:23:27.879 --> 00:23:31.584
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:35.766
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

00:23:35.975 --> 00:23:40.352
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

00:23:40.553 --> 00:23:46.654
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

00:23:46.855 --> 00:23:51.528
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:58.927
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

00:23:59.818 --> 00:24:03.575
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:11.719
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:17.622
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:25.487
being absolutely beyond any problem.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:31.373
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

00:24:31.574 --> 00:24:37.380
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:41.288
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

00:24:41.489 --> 00:24:46.210
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:52.666
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

00:24:53.784 --> 00:24:58.611
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

00:24:58.812 --> 00:25:03.014
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

00:25:03.215 --> 00:25:06.353
Only the designers they make the money.

00:25:06.553 --> 00:25:11.417
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

00:25:12.968 --> 00:25:20.840
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

00:25:22.088 --> 00:25:24.694
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

00:25:24.895 --> 00:25:29.988
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

00:25:30.189 --> 00:25:35.419
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:43.515
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

00:25:44.962 --> 00:25:48.973
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

00:25:49.174 --> 00:25:53.165
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

00:25:53.366 --> 00:25:58.356
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

00:25:58.564 --> 00:26:02.326
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:08.751
So, I went to one shop in America

00:26:08.952 --> 00:26:11.936
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:16.714
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

00:26:16.915 --> 00:26:23.451
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

00:26:23.652 --> 00:26:28.165
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

00:26:30.327 --> 00:26:38.322
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

00:26:38.523 --> 00:26:47.031
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

00:26:47.232 --> 00:26:51.889
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.719
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

00:26:57.354 --> 00:27:01.774
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.506
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:09.472
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

00:27:09.758 --> 00:27:13.753
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

00:27:13.954 --> 00:27:17.899
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

00:27:18.566 --> 00:27:22.728
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

00:27:22.929 --> 00:27:26.449
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:31.015
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:37.379
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:42.250
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:47.523
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

00:27:47.724 --> 00:27:52.211
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

00:27:52.412 --> 00:27:55.132
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

00:27:55.341 --> 00:28:03.995
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

00:28:06.428 --> 00:28:12.226
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.684
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

00:28:15.885 --> 00:28:19.830
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:24.444
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

00:28:24.645 --> 00:28:31.483
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

00:28:31.684 --> 00:28:37.913
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:44.084
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

00:28:44.285 --> 00:28:53.839
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.605
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:03.519
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.691
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

00:29:07.905 --> 00:29:10.648
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:13.937
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

00:29:14.138 --> 00:29:17.918
if they can get the same dinner set.

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:22.541
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:22.742 --> 00:29:32.303
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

00:29:32.504 --> 00:29:36.355
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

00:29:36.556 --> 00:29:40.591
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

00:29:40.792 --> 00:29:44.577
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

00:29:44.778 --> 00:29:52.173
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

00:29:52.461 --> 00:29:55.162
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

00:29:55.392 --> 00:29:58.195
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:05.359
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:11.481
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

00:30:12.203 --> 00:30:17.749
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

00:30:18.366 --> 00:30:24.470
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

00:30:26.797 --> 00:30:30.158
Just there you get it.

00:30:31.112 --> 00:30:36.592
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

00:30:36.802 --> 00:30:41.274
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

00:30:41.475 --> 00:30:44.991
if you don’t have greed about it.

00:30:45.198 --> 00:30:50.980
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

00:30:51.181 --> 00:30:57.686
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

00:30:57.887 --> 00:31:03.844
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

00:31:04.045 --> 00:31:10.138
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

00:31:10.797 --> 00:31:18.052
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

00:31:18.424 --> 00:31:21.893
And then the thing also gets lost.

00:31:22.094 --> 00:31:29.341
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:34.704
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

00:31:35.957 --> 00:31:39.668
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

00:31:39.869 --> 00:31:45.841
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

00:31:46.042 --> 00:31:51.641
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

00:31:51.842 --> 00:31:56.941
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:08.788
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:20.513
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

00:32:21.978 --> 00:32:27.830
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:32.651
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

00:32:32.852 --> 00:32:39.654
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

00:32:41.296 --> 00:32:46.621
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

00:32:47.505 --> 00:32:50.094
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

00:32:50.295 --> 00:32:54.193
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

00:32:57.499 --> 00:33:01.994
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

00:33:08.174 --> 00:33:11.520
They are mostly from Russia.

00:33:13.232 --> 00:33:21.973
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:27.218
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:32.842
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

00:33:33.043 --> 00:33:36.926
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

00:33:37.127 --> 00:33:42.275
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

00:33:42.853 --> 00:33:46.981
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

00:33:47.182 --> 00:33:52.497
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:56.632
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

00:33:56.833 --> 00:34:01.070
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

00:34:01.278 --> 00:34:06.513
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

00:34:07.689 --> 00:34:13.841
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

00:34:14.042 --> 00:34:19.075
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

00:34:19.276 --> 00:34:22.172
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

00:34:22.373 --> 00:34:26.022
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

00:34:26.223 --> 00:34:31.532
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

00:34:31.733 --> 00:34:37.343
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

00:34:37.544 --> 00:34:44.349
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:50.554
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

00:34:51.348 --> 00:34:55.941
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

00:34:56.142 --> 00:35:01.955
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

00:35:02.847 --> 00:35:07.207
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

00:35:07.408 --> 00:35:11.378
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:17.232
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

00:35:18.969 --> 00:35:28.808
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

00:35:29.009 --> 00:35:33.894
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

00:35:34.095 --> 00:35:41.193
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

00:35:42.524 --> 00:35:47.851
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

00:35:48.052 --> 00:35:54.082
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

00:35:54.724 --> 00:35:59.774
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

00:35:59.975 --> 00:36:05.980
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:11.317
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

00:36:11.518 --> 00:36:16.206
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:20.844
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:26.825
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

00:36:27.026 --> 00:36:32.439
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:39.677
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

00:36:40.467 --> 00:36:48.168
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

00:36:52.986 --> 00:37:00.541
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

00:37:00.742 --> 00:37:05.076
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

00:37:06.021 --> 00:37:11.160
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:14.609
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.989
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:24.294
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

00:37:24.495 --> 00:37:27.615
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

00:37:27.816 --> 00:37:31.448
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:35.395
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

00:37:35.596 --> 00:37:43.644
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:48.252
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

00:37:48.453 --> 00:37:55.914
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

00:37:56.115 --> 00:38:01.071
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

00:38:01.272 --> 00:38:03.958
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

00:38:04.172 --> 00:38:08.104
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

00:38:08.305 --> 00:38:12.112
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

00:38:12.313 --> 00:38:14.778
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

00:38:14.979 --> 00:38:21.463
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

00:38:21.664 --> 00:38:28.797
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

00:38:28.998 --> 00:38:36.000
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

00:38:36.201 --> 00:38:39.626
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

00:38:39.827 --> 00:38:44.617
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

00:38:44.779 --> 00:38:48.867
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

00:38:49.068 --> 00:38:54.896
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

00:38:55.097 --> 00:39:00.552
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

00:39:00.777 --> 00:39:04.481
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

00:39:04.682 --> 00:39:10.816
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

00:39:11.017 --> 00:39:16.072
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

00:39:16.273 --> 00:39:20.562
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

00:39:20.763 --> 00:39:25.007
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:32.666
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

00:39:32.867 --> 00:39:36.637
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

00:39:36.838 --> 00:39:41.551
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

00:39:41.752 --> 00:39:44.495
that we have got the Spirit within us.

00:39:44.696 --> 00:39:50.226
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

00:39:50.427 --> 00:39:53.917
You are people who are all realized souls.

00:39:54.118 --> 00:39:58.987
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

00:39:59.188 --> 00:40:03.559
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:11.376
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

00:40:11.577 --> 00:40:15.483
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

00:40:15.683 --> 00:40:22.674
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:27.538
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:32.822
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

00:40:33.023 --> 00:40:36.227
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

00:40:36.428 --> 00:40:43.465
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

00:40:44.471 --> 00:40:48.076
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

00:40:48.277 --> 00:40:50.317
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

00:40:50.518 --> 00:40:55.008
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

00:40:55.209 --> 00:41:01.356
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

00:41:01.557 --> 00:41:08.566
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:15.078
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

00:41:15.279 --> 00:41:20.274
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

00:41:20.475 --> 00:41:26.607
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

00:41:26.808 --> 00:41:31.237
it is absolutely a hell for man.

00:41:32.563 --> 00:41:38.484
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

00:41:38.685 --> 00:41:44.674
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

00:41:44.875 --> 00:41:49.746
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:49.891 --> 00:41:53.232
What pleases the husband?

00:41:54.744 --> 00:41:58.131
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

00:41:58.332 --> 00:42:04.026
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

00:42:04.227 --> 00:42:09.090
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:12.951
First of all find out what he likes.

00:42:14.679 --> 00:42:17.646
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

00:42:17.847 --> 00:42:20.712
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

00:42:20.913 --> 00:42:25.455
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

00:42:25.656 --> 00:42:31.151
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

00:42:31.352 --> 00:42:37.023
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:40.579
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.208
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

00:42:44.409 --> 00:42:51.291
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

00:42:51.492 --> 00:42:54.981
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

00:42:55.158 --> 00:42:59.269
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:04.044
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

00:43:04.245 --> 00:43:07.677
because women are responsible
for the society.

00:43:07.878 --> 00:43:14.156
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

00:43:14.357 --> 00:43:18.972
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

00:43:19.173 --> 00:43:24.648
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

00:43:24.849 --> 00:43:29.268
But your job is to make the society.

00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:34.028
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

00:43:34.229 --> 00:43:38.612
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

00:43:38.813 --> 00:43:44.245
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

00:43:44.446 --> 00:43:47.049
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:56.109
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

00:43:56.966 --> 00:44:02.662
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

00:44:04.372 --> 00:44:10.771
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

00:44:10.972 --> 00:44:16.559
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.735
But there was one gentleman, good one,

00:44:19.936 --> 00:44:23.906
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

00:44:24.107 --> 00:44:27.957
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

00:44:28.158 --> 00:44:35.053
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

00:44:35.827 --> 00:44:38.790
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

00:44:38.991 --> 00:44:41.815
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

00:44:42.016 --> 00:44:48.843
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

00:44:49.044 --> 00:44:53.241
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

00:44:53.442 --> 00:44:58.815
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

00:44:59.016 --> 00:45:03.522
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

00:45:03.723 --> 00:45:08.321
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

00:45:08.522 --> 00:45:13.275
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

00:45:13.476 --> 00:45:17.401
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

00:45:17.602 --> 00:45:21.467
Immediately this competition.

00:45:26.902 --> 00:45:30.003
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

00:45:30.204 --> 00:45:33.169
even in London he was helping him a lot.

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:39.321
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

00:45:39.522 --> 00:45:44.023
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.726
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

00:45:49.927 --> 00:45:53.407
Otherwise for small, small things,

00:45:53.608 --> 00:45:58.191
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

00:45:58.392 --> 00:46:04.824
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

00:46:06.269 --> 00:46:11.046
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

00:46:11.247 --> 00:46:15.988
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

00:46:16.189 --> 00:46:21.729
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:27.565
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

00:46:27.766 --> 00:46:30.137
[Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

00:46:30.338 --> 00:46:34.913
she was married to somebody in USA.

00:46:35.114 --> 00:46:42.468
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

00:46:42.669 --> 00:46:46.146
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

00:46:46.347 --> 00:46:53.412
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

00:46:53.613 --> 00:46:59.944
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

00:47:00.145 --> 00:47:05.584
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

00:47:05.785 --> 00:47:11.170
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:15.082
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

00:47:15.283 --> 00:47:20.357
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

00:47:20.558 --> 00:47:24.124
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:30.842
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

00:47:31.043 --> 00:47:34.982
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

00:47:35.915 --> 00:47:45.548
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

00:47:45.749 --> 00:47:48.677
Why has he married?

00:47:48.878 --> 00:47:55.863
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

00:47:59.462 --> 00:48:01.854
It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

00:48:02.055 --> 00:48:07.023
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

00:48:07.224 --> 00:48:10.474
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

00:48:10.675 --> 00:48:15.586
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

00:48:15.787 --> 00:48:20.078
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:26.104
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

00:48:26.271 --> 00:48:31.342
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

00:48:31.543 --> 00:48:34.687
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

00:48:34.888 --> 00:48:38.821
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

00:48:39.022 --> 00:48:45.408
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

00:48:45.609 --> 00:48:51.032
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

00:48:51.233 --> 00:48:55.528
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

00:48:56.689 --> 00:49:02.037
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

00:49:02.214 --> 00:49:06.197
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

00:49:06.398 --> 00:49:13.731
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:19.860
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

00:49:20.061 --> 00:49:22.733
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

00:49:22.934 --> 00:49:25.751
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

00:49:25.952 --> 00:49:31.288
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

00:49:33.467 --> 00:49:39.456
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

00:49:39.657 --> 00:49:44.517
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

00:49:48.728 --> 00:49:51.866
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

00:49:52.067 --> 00:49:55.814
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

00:49:56.015 --> 00:50:00.311
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

00:50:00.512 --> 00:50:05.745
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

00:50:07.383 --> 00:50:10.776
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

00:50:10.977 --> 00:50:14.458
try to understand why she does it.

00:50:14.659 --> 00:50:19.463
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

00:50:19.664 --> 00:50:25.251
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

00:50:25.452 --> 00:50:30.364
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

00:50:30.565 --> 00:50:36.045
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:42.225
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

00:50:42.426 --> 00:50:46.678
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

00:50:46.879 --> 00:50:50.837
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

00:50:51.038 --> 00:50:55.492
and he is not there and this and that.”

00:50:55.808 --> 00:50:59.149
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:04.755
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

00:51:04.956 --> 00:51:08.984
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

00:51:09.185 --> 00:51:11.975
I can’t understand the logic.

00:51:12.176 --> 00:51:16.673
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

00:51:16.874 --> 00:51:22.385
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

00:51:23.051 --> 00:51:31.655
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

00:51:31.856 --> 00:51:38.005
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

00:51:39.612 --> 00:51:42.198
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:47.214
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

00:51:47.415 --> 00:51:52.763
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

00:51:52.964 --> 00:51:57.508
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

00:51:57.709 --> 00:52:02.973
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

00:52:03.174 --> 00:52:07.337
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

00:52:07.538 --> 00:52:10.793
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

00:52:11.444 --> 00:52:17.447
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

00:52:17.648 --> 00:52:21.278
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

00:52:21.479 --> 00:52:26.548
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

00:52:26.733 --> 00:52:30.517
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

00:52:30.718 --> 00:52:33.325
So, with such an ignorance of things,

00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:38.441
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

00:52:39.961 --> 00:52:47.298
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

00:52:47.499 --> 00:52:52.079
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

00:52:52.287 --> 00:53:00.515
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

00:53:00.778 --> 00:53:03.627
He buys always very expensive things.

00:53:03.828 --> 00:53:08.063
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

00:53:08.264 --> 00:53:13.315
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

00:53:13.516 --> 00:53:18.898
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

00:53:19.099 --> 00:53:24.041
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

00:53:24.242 --> 00:53:29.346
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

00:53:29.547 --> 00:53:35.310
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

00:53:35.511 --> 00:53:39.661
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

00:53:39.838 --> 00:53:43.480
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

00:53:43.681 --> 00:53:47.403
but he likes to give that only – all right.

00:53:47.604 --> 00:53:52.259
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.413
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

00:53:56.614 --> 00:54:02.234
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

00:54:02.435 --> 00:54:07.267
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

00:54:07.468 --> 00:54:14.135
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

00:54:14.336 --> 00:54:20.873
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

00:54:21.074 --> 00:54:24.007
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

00:54:24.208 --> 00:54:28.877
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

00:54:29.078 --> 00:54:32.652
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

00:54:32.853 --> 00:54:36.762
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

00:54:36.963 --> 00:54:40.014
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

00:54:40.215 --> 00:54:43.586
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

00:54:43.787 --> 00:54:49.568
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

00:54:49.769 --> 00:54:54.940
[Hindi aside]

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.380
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

00:54:58.594 --> 00:55:02.516
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

00:55:02.717 --> 00:55:06.608
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

00:55:06.809 --> 00:55:11.130
I was walking like a giant, you know.

00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:21.682
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

00:55:21.883 --> 00:55:25.918
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

00:55:26.119 --> 00:55:29.195
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

00:55:29.396 --> 00:55:33.627
I sat in one place glued down into that.

00:55:33.828 --> 00:55:39.087
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

00:55:39.288 --> 00:55:44.799
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.387
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

00:55:48.588 --> 00:55:52.521
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

00:55:52.722 --> 00:55:58.617
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:01.895
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:06.941
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

00:56:07.142 --> 00:56:09.825
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

00:56:10.026 --> 00:56:16.354
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

00:56:16.578 --> 00:56:23.107
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

00:56:23.308 --> 00:56:28.181
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

00:56:28.382 --> 00:56:31.621
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

00:56:31.822 --> 00:56:34.919
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

00:56:35.119 --> 00:56:40.611
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

00:56:40.812 --> 00:56:43.757
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

00:56:43.958 --> 00:56:47.445
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

00:56:47.646 --> 00:56:52.602
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

00:56:55.598 --> 00:56:57.790
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

00:56:57.991 --> 00:57:00.735
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

00:57:00.936 --> 00:57:06.051
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

00:57:06.252 --> 00:57:08.951
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

00:57:09.152 --> 00:57:15.103
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

00:57:15.304 --> 00:57:19.989
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:25.827
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

00:57:26.013 --> 00:57:27.625
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

00:57:27.826 --> 00:57:30.915
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

00:57:31.116 --> 00:57:34.886
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

00:57:35.087 --> 00:57:39.293
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

00:57:39.494 --> 00:57:44.071
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

00:57:44.272 --> 00:57:49.202
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

00:57:51.356 --> 00:57:55.631
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

00:57:55.816 --> 00:58:01.764
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

00:58:01.965 --> 00:58:05.900
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:12.088
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

00:58:12.289 --> 00:58:14.674
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

00:58:14.875 --> 00:58:19.555
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:23.920
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.025
You are not going to beat (them).

00:58:28.103 --> 00:58:33.342
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:36.470
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:40.444
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

00:58:40.645 --> 00:58:44.454
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

00:58:44.655 --> 00:58:48.313
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

00:58:48.514 --> 00:58:53.237
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

00:58:53.438 --> 00:59:00.455
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

00:59:00.656 --> 00:59:05.130
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

00:59:05.338 --> 00:59:13.580
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

00:59:13.781 --> 00:59:19.161
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

00:59:19.362 --> 00:59:25.784
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

00:59:25.991 --> 00:59:29.474
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

00:59:29.675 --> 00:59:32.241
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

00:59:32.442 --> 00:59:37.515
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

00:59:37.716 --> 00:59:40.259
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:45.664
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

00:59:45.865 --> 00:59:52.475
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

00:59:52.676 --> 00:59:55.497
In India no woman will do that.

00:59:55.698 --> 01:00:00.057
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

01:00:05.707 --> 01:00:11.685
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

01:00:11.886 --> 01:00:15.118
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

01:00:15.319 --> 01:00:19.508
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

01:00:19.709 --> 01:00:22.607
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

01:00:22.808 --> 01:00:29.093
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

01:00:29.294 --> 01:00:32.685
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

01:00:32.886 --> 01:00:35.706
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

01:00:35.907 --> 01:00:39.767
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

01:00:39.968 --> 01:00:43.778
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

01:00:43.979 --> 01:00:51.124
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

01:00:51.325 --> 01:00:55.378
But this Western women never understand.

01:00:55.579 --> 01:01:01.593
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

01:01:01.793 --> 01:01:07.244
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

01:01:07.445 --> 01:01:10.956
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

01:01:11.157 --> 01:01:15.268
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

01:01:15.469 --> 01:01:20.123
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

01:01:20.324 --> 01:01:25.524
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:34.105
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

01:01:34.306 --> 01:01:41.739
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.153
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

01:01:45.354 --> 01:01:51.161
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

01:01:51.362 --> 01:01:54.015
This is very Western, I must say.

01:01:54.216 --> 01:02:01.055
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:06.952
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

01:02:07.153 --> 01:02:10.924
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:15.204
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

01:02:15.405 --> 01:02:18.937
This is not the way a woman should look.

01:02:19.138 --> 01:02:23.848
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:30.275
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

01:02:30.476 --> 01:02:37.989
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:42.819
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:47.140
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:50.385
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

01:02:50.586 --> 01:03:00.789
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:08.595
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:18.201
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

01:03:18.386 --> 01:03:20.813
Who are you to like or not like?

01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:25.951
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

01:03:26.152 --> 01:03:32.342
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:40.346
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

01:03:40.547 --> 01:03:45.132
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:49.842
and should have very, very large hearts.

01:03:53.442 --> 01:04:02.053
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

01:04:02.254 --> 01:04:05.458
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:11.473
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:19.171
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

01:04:19.372 --> 01:04:26.385
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

01:04:26.586 --> 01:04:31.442
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

01:04:31.643 --> 01:04:34.749
very, very good reports about them.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:39.853
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

01:04:40.054 --> 01:04:43.213
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

01:04:43.414 --> 01:04:49.385
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:57.184
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

01:04:57.385 --> 01:05:00.236
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

01:05:00.437 --> 01:05:04.002
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.285
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

01:05:07.486 --> 01:05:11.172
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

01:05:11.373 --> 01:05:16.164
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

01:05:16.365 --> 01:05:20.112
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

01:05:20.313 --> 01:05:24.582
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

01:05:24.783 --> 01:05:28.013
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

01:05:28.214 --> 01:05:32.614
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:39.127
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

01:05:39.297 --> 01:05:42.441
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

01:05:42.642 --> 01:05:48.147
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:50.868
thanks to Swiss influence.

01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:56.043
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

01:05:56.250 --> 01:06:01.727
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

01:06:01.928 --> 01:06:06.510
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

01:06:11.748 --> 01:06:15.763
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

01:06:15.964 --> 01:06:21.289
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:28.391
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

01:06:29.707 --> 01:06:32.869
This is the book. You all should buy it.

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:36.484
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

01:06:36.685 --> 01:06:40.003
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

01:07:02.423 --> 01:07:05.689
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:09.470
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

01:07:09.671 --> 01:07:14.520
So, you will understand about Indian music.

01:07:14.721 --> 01:07:20.919
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

01:07:21.353 --> 01:07:28.234
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:34.686
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

01:07:34.887 --> 01:07:39.623
who were singing western song, was alright.

01:07:39.824 --> 01:07:44.958
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

01:07:45.159 --> 01:07:48.401
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

01:07:48.602 --> 01:07:52.199
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.468
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

01:07:56.669 --> 01:08:00.116
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

01:08:00.317 --> 01:08:04.557
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

01:08:04.758 --> 01:08:08.867
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

01:08:09.044 --> 01:08:14.565
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

01:08:14.766 --> 01:08:22.628
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:26.465
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:33.065
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

01:08:33.266 --> 01:08:37.435
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

01:08:37.636 --> 01:08:40.194
They are having all this horrible music
there.

01:08:40.395 --> 01:08:45.815
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

01:08:46.016 --> 01:08:50.201
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

01:08:50.382 --> 01:08:57.524
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

01:08:57.692 --> 01:09:02.031
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

01:09:02.232 --> 01:09:06.131
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:08.962
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

01:09:09.163 --> 01:09:14.120
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.101
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

01:09:19.326 --> 01:09:22.761
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

01:09:22.962 --> 01:09:27.456
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

01:09:27.657 --> 01:09:37.333
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

01:09:37.534 --> 01:09:43.978
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:55.007
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:59.754
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

01:09:59.955 --> 01:10:05.941
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:08.082
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

01:10:08.283 --> 01:10:12.192
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

01:10:12.393 --> 01:10:16.566
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

01:10:16.767 --> 01:10:20.211
you will see how different it will be.

01:10:22.348 --> 01:10:25.932
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

01:10:26.133 --> 01:10:28.777
which you should have, and which you should
understand

01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:38.213
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

01:10:38.414 --> 01:10:44.711
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

01:10:44.912 --> 01:10:50.149
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:56.353
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

01:10:57.802 --> 01:11:01.431
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:05.614
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

01:11:05.815 --> 01:11:11.209
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:14.158
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

01:11:14.359 --> 01:11:18.051
Then you can expand it as you like.

01:11:18.252 --> 01:11:24.376
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

01:11:24.577 --> 01:11:28.841
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

01:11:29.042 --> 01:11:35.320
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

01:11:35.608 --> 01:11:42.172
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

01:11:42.704 --> 01:11:45.043
Accha.

01:11:45.244 --> 01:11:50.011
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:56.585
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

01:11:56.786 --> 01:12:06.507
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

01:12:06.934 --> 01:12:15.070
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

01:12:19.108 --> 01:12:24.011
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

01:12:24.212 --> 01:12:31.301
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

01:12:31.502 --> 01:12:39.751
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

01:12:39.952 --> 01:12:46.688
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

01:12:46.889 --> 01:12:55.209
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

01:12:55.410 --> 01:13:03.476
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

01:13:03.677 --> 01:13:08.584
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:12.875
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

01:13:13.076 --> 01:13:19.700
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:25.257
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:32.429
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:40.206
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

01:13:40.407 --> 01:13:46.912
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

01:13:47.113 --> 01:13:52.902
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

01:13:53.103 --> 01:13:56.409
Because when you try to do something wrong

01:13:56.610 --> 01:14:00.706
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

01:14:03.388 --> 01:14:07.675
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:13.760
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:19.825
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

01:14:20.026 --> 01:14:23.682
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

01:14:23.883 --> 01:14:28.744
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

01:14:28.945 --> 01:14:33.129
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:38.268
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

01:14:38.469 --> 01:14:41.909
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:45.597
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

01:14:45.798 --> 01:14:51.363
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

01:14:53.137 --> 01:14:59.211
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:03.756
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

01:15:03.956 --> 01:15:07.663
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

01:15:07.864 --> 01:15:12.947
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

01:15:13.148 --> 01:15:17.731
than father, mother, even Mataji.

01:15:19.032 --> 01:15:23.961
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

01:15:24.901 --> 01:15:27.174
So, thank you very much.
