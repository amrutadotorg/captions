WEBVTT

00:04.023 --> 00:07.598
Welcome to you all.

00:24.764 --> 00:31.083
It has been little bit delayed but just
now they have informed Me that

00:31.284 --> 00:36.102
the plane is delayed even much more, so I
thought it’s better to have the puja now,

00:36.303 --> 00:38.775
though the English had told us that
they would like

00:38.976 --> 00:41.491
to attend from the very beginning.

00:41.692 --> 00:46.425
They always get many more pujas,
that may be the reason.

00:57.416 --> 01:05.627
So now we have all arrived here and we
are going to start this pilgrimage

01:06.921 --> 01:13.895
of travelling together.

01:16.554 --> 01:28.334
The journey is of a very subtle nature

01:28.987 --> 01:36.396
and, if we realize why we are here,
we’ll understand

01:36.597 --> 01:46.298
that all this Creation is watching you all

01:47.020 --> 01:53.185
and it’s trying to help you that you
should ascend

01:53.386 --> 02:00.576
and that you feel your depth and thus
enjoy your Self.

02:02.714 --> 02:07.671
The travel may not be very comfortable.

02:07.893 --> 02:16.038
The roads are

02:19.879 --> 02:28.120
so very filled with speed-breakers

02:28.469 --> 02:33.809
and all kinds of obstructions.

02:34.356 --> 02:39.950
Is a journey like of our ascent I felt,

02:40.930 --> 02:46.621
that our speed has to be brought down.

02:47.778 --> 02:54.916
In the West we have become very speedy,
no doubt,

02:55.117 --> 03:03.388
and to bring down this speed we have to use

03:07.515 --> 03:18.364
meditative process that we feel our peace
within ourselves.

03:22.602 --> 03:28.916
Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds

03:30.443 --> 03:37.217
and we react very fast

03:41.371 --> 03:45.973
to others and to these thoughts.

03:48.333 --> 03:52.757
So one has to be aware,

03:54.419 --> 04:01.521
one has to be knowing what is happening
within yourself,

04:04.684 --> 04:09.656
that the thoughts are bombarding you,

04:10.106 --> 04:15.090
you are trying to ascend

04:16.435 --> 04:24.427
and you find it very difficult to get rid
of the thoughts.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.465
The thought process can start

04:33.352 --> 04:39.490
by your conditioning or by your ego –
only two problems.

04:46.633 --> 04:52.203
And you are the one who is under
the challenge.

04:57.089 --> 05:01.783
So you have got these simple people
in the village

05:03.827 --> 05:12.308
who start watching everything but
they do not react.

05:13.265 --> 05:20.252
If you do not react then your thoughts
will give up.

05:22.212 --> 05:32.216
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

05:34.758 --> 05:42.168
but you are experiencing and enjoying
the silence,

05:43.090 --> 05:49.668
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

05:49.869 --> 05:56.405
of your being as well as whatever is
around you.

05:58.779 --> 06:03.945
You don’t have to force yourself to break
this habit,

06:06.853 --> 06:11.278
but just to be on the watch-out.

06:13.898 --> 06:20.057
It’s not necessary to talk too much
about it also,

06:23.779 --> 06:27.383
nor it is necessary

06:31.841 --> 06:36.369
to think about anything.

06:36.570 --> 06:42.908
Because supposing you see a tree –
so it’s a tree only.

06:43.109 --> 06:46.679
What are we going to think about it?

06:46.880 --> 06:52.313
And whatever we may think about it,
it’s going to be the tree!

06:55.128 --> 07:00.724
So there’s no harm in appearing little bit
stupid – doesn’t matter.

07:00.925 --> 07:07.660
But this is the basic thing, is, that when
we start analyzing,

07:07.861 --> 07:13.067
we are breaking our own nerves,

07:13.464 --> 07:21.503
and poisoning our own mind and brain.

07:24.166 --> 07:33.237
So to watch something without analysis,
without thinking about it, is reality.

07:36.250 --> 07:40.680
If you can achieve that point where
you watch everything

07:40.881 --> 07:45.615
without reacting, you are in reality,

07:50.717 --> 08:01.837
and then only the penetration into
the subtleties of your surroundings,

08:02.038 --> 08:07.019
of your relationships, your friendships

08:09.632 --> 08:16.236
the whole universe, dawns upon you.

08:19.383 --> 08:23.567
That’s why I’ve said that in this
pilgrimage

08:23.768 --> 08:31.828
the first thing we have to remember [is]
that we have to be aware ourselves.

08:32.029 --> 08:36.731
But when you are only thinking about
others,

08:36.932 --> 08:40.615
how others have to behave: “They should
do like this!” -

08:40.816 --> 08:47.905
that leave it to your leaders to break
their heads, that’s not your job.

08:48.508 --> 08:53.646
It’s a headache for them I know, but they
have to do it, it’s all right.

08:53.847 --> 08:59.305
But why do you want to break your heads
for nothing at all?

09:01.236 --> 09:05.224
So to judge others, to think of others,

09:05.425 --> 09:11.342
what they are doing, what’s wrong
with them,

09:12.845 --> 09:22.988
about anything whatsoever you may think
is wrong – is not going to be corrected.

09:24.022 --> 09:29.064
Like I know some people who are specially
bureaucrats,

09:29.265 --> 09:33.529
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

09:33.730 --> 09:41.236
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

09:41.437 --> 09:46.358
or “I think it would have been nice if this
house was facing the other way” –

09:46.559 --> 09:53.822
but it’s not, you see? It is not going
to face [that way].

09:54.235 --> 10:01.733
It is going to be the way it is, so what is
the use of wasting your brain,

10:01.934 --> 10:11.322
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something which doesn’t work out,

10:11.523 --> 10:15.171
and never going to work out either.

10:16.411 --> 10:20.443
So when we start like, “I think

10:21.184 --> 10:27.365
these trees should have been little
taller” – but they are not!

10:29.774 --> 10:32.339
“I think

10:36.977 --> 10:44.837
that the crows should stop their noise” –
they will not.

10:47.213 --> 10:53.791
So just accept it. Acceptance is the way

10:54.847 --> 11:00.960
we are going to enjoy. But acceptance
doesn’t mean tolerance,

11:01.161 --> 11:07.367
because tolerance means you have
to work very hard

11:07.568 --> 11:11.522
to accept that the trees are of the same
height –

11:11.723 --> 11:14.748
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

11:14.949 --> 11:21.129
When you say, “I have to tolerate it,
you see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

11:27.217 --> 11:33.714
So acceptance as it is whatever you see,
acceptance.

11:34.119 --> 11:38.043
And that is how people grow I have seen,
those who start accepting.

11:38.244 --> 11:45.654
That’s the sign. That’s the sign of their
strength and their depth.

11:45.855 --> 11:52.940
Like the propensity of this Mother Earth,
She is what She is.

11:57.510 --> 12:02.419
And She bears whatever is there.

12:05.679 --> 12:14.032
If you put a heavy thing on Her, She’ll put
equal and opposite force and bear it.

12:14.233 --> 12:20.156
She doesn’t say, “I’m tolerating it,
I am exerting any pressure”.

12:20.357 --> 12:23.782
But She is just accepting.

12:27.018 --> 12:33.125
So the witnessing and awareness develops

12:33.326 --> 12:38.720
when we start just accepting things
as they are.

12:39.743 --> 12:43.804
“I think” doesn’t work out.

12:47.060 --> 12:52.527
“I think it would have been better like
this” doesn’t work out.

12:55.702 --> 12:59.949
Then second problem is “I like”.

13:02.160 --> 13:09.300
Now, “I like to eat a cake” - but there is
no cake, what to do?

13:11.655 --> 13:16.585
Now, whatever is there, enjoy it as a cake.

13:18.080 --> 13:25.545
But if you go on thinking like that –
“I like whatever is not here” –

13:25.746 --> 13:30.367
you can never be happy, as simple as that.

13:30.568 --> 13:38.241
You have to say, “I like whatever is there.

13:39.240 --> 13:45.430
I enjoy whatever is there”. Then that’s
the reality.

13:45.631 --> 13:53.339
Whatever doesn’t exist, if you like it,

13:55.838 --> 13:59.512
so what can anybody do about it?

14:03.203 --> 14:09.726
It works out in so many ways, in so many
facets in life,

14:09.927 --> 14:18.451
that advantage is taken by people because
we become so vulnerable

14:18.652 --> 14:24.052
to our likes and dislikes that
the entrepreneurs take over

14:24.253 --> 14:30.893
and they create likes and dislikes
in our heads, and put ideas every day.

14:31.094 --> 14:34.181
I’ve seen it now, how they do it,

14:34.382 --> 14:38.558
through television, through newspapers,
through this, that.

14:38.759 --> 14:42.922
So then you say, “Now, I like this”.

14:44.146 --> 14:48.038
But from where this liking has come

14:48.247 --> 14:53.406
is the conditioning which is put
into your head.

14:56.881 --> 15:02.610
So you are a slave of that conditioning.

15:05.922 --> 15:15.110
“I only like roses and I don’t like
any other flower”.

15:15.311 --> 15:23.131
But why? Why you don’t like any
other flower?

15:27.866 --> 15:36.344
And for such things whatever we have
we miss the joy.

15:39.617 --> 15:47.522
So the second part should be that,
“Enjoy everything.”

15:51.083 --> 15:54.323
“Why am I here?

15:58.278 --> 16:07.941
It’s not a very comfortable place
by any chance, so why am I here?”

16:11.792 --> 16:16.013
To enjoy each other.

16:18.702 --> 16:22.342
To enjoy your own being.

16:22.543 --> 16:30.950
The more divergence you have outside,
appealing to your ego and conditioning,

16:31.151 --> 16:35.834
the more your mind is busy with that,

16:38.978 --> 16:46.974
then you cannot enjoy anything.

16:50.062 --> 16:54.975
So come to the other conditioning which
is very subtle

16:56.572 --> 17:02.847
that, “I’m an Englishman”, or
“I’m an American”,

17:03.048 --> 17:14.099
or maybe even “I’m from Derbyshire”,
and then “I’m from another shire”,

17:15.461 --> 17:19.508
and then “better form a group”.

17:22.337 --> 17:25.928
The grouping starts.

17:26.698 --> 17:33.984
In a subtle way it is a kind
of an insecurity.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.811
So we start clubbing.

17:43.860 --> 17:47.870
Animals do that very often, they have
to do it

17:48.071 --> 17:52.636
because their sense of insecurity
is quite a lot.

17:52.837 --> 17:57.556
And then human beings also do it -

17:58.000 --> 18:03.315
but not the saints, not the angels.

18:03.688 --> 18:08.933
They don’t form [groups] because they have
no nationality.

18:10.279 --> 18:14.399
Nationality is also a conditioning.

18:16.943 --> 18:22.783
They don’t belong to any one place,
to any one country.

18:23.767 --> 18:28.295
So now those who have come by plane,
had to come,

18:28.496 --> 18:34.707
because from every country there’s
one plane by which they come,

18:35.391 --> 18:42.855
must know one thing – that now we have
landed,

18:43.056 --> 18:51.121
and we are all Sahaj Yogis here,
and forget your countries.

18:51.959 --> 18:59.566
Forget them and mix up with other people.

18:59.767 --> 19:05.929
Please do not form groups. There is no need
at all to form groups.

19:06.130 --> 19:13.833
So I would request you that in the buses,
because it starts from the airport

19:14.034 --> 19:19.904
you start forming groups and it continues
till the end you go back.

19:20.105 --> 19:27.521
I think it would be a nice idea to break
that, and let people sit

19:27.722 --> 19:36.009
together of different countries and
different nationalities.

19:36.210 --> 19:40.736
And talk to each other, try to know
about each other,

19:40.937 --> 19:43.676
try to find out about each other.

19:43.877 --> 19:50.260
Not just what you know from the newspaper,

19:50.461 --> 19:56.164
but the different problems of Sahaja Yoga,

19:56.365 --> 20:00.080
what are the problems of Sahaja Yoga
in a particular country,

20:00.289 --> 20:04.358
what happens in a particular country.

20:06.303 --> 20:14.820
The worst of all is the conditioning
of reading also.

20:22.178 --> 20:27.668
Reading without light is useless,

20:28.176 --> 20:33.066
and some people still have a habit

20:33.389 --> 20:39.355
of remembering something they have read

20:40.220 --> 20:45.386
and a kind of a show-off as they say.

20:47.756 --> 20:56.285
Is better to listen to others.
Let others talk.

20:56.930 --> 21:05.439
In Sahaja Yoga on what subject
you’ll discuss?

21:05.734 --> 21:10.926
I don’t know, how can you discuss
on anything?

21:11.127 --> 21:18.429
Now you see this one as a green thing.

21:19.725 --> 21:23.073
Now, what can you discuss on this?

21:23.274 --> 21:28.794
You will say, “All right, it’s green, but…
there is so”.

21:28.995 --> 21:34.167
Then another one says, “No, this is green,
but…”.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.705
One may go on like that, madly.

21:40.363 --> 21:44.746
There is no need to discuss in Sahaja Yoga.

21:44.947 --> 21:48.148
I just don’t know what are we going
to discuss. You know everything,

21:48.349 --> 21:52.248
you know how Kundalini rises, you know
how chakras are cleared out,

21:52.449 --> 21:56.552
you know how you get realization,
you all know who’s, who catches,

21:56.753 --> 22:02.321
what, and you know that how it affects.

22:02.522 --> 22:08.987
Now, if that is the fact, if that is
the truth, that is what it is,

22:09.188 --> 22:13.096
what are we going to discuss about it?

22:13.962 --> 22:17.346
Discussions are over now.

22:18.191 --> 22:25.135
You are gnostics, you are knowledgeable
people. You have the knowledge.

22:25.435 --> 22:30.217
But the knowledge that you have is shared
by everyone of you.

22:30.418 --> 22:35.620
At the most, you can talk about
your experiences,

22:35.821 --> 22:44.900
you can talk about your relationships,
how you have enjoyed.

22:45.736 --> 22:49.950
But there is nothing to discuss
in Sahaja Yoga.

22:50.151 --> 22:54.585
I’ve heard about people who are discussing.

22:55.157 --> 23:00.075
I just don’t know how can there be
a discussion about Sahaja Yoga.

23:00.559 --> 23:03.728
I would be very happy to know, if you can
tell Me,

23:03.929 --> 23:07.710
how we can discuss about Sahaja Yoga.

23:12.829 --> 23:18.371
So we have to remember that whatever
we talk, we should talk

23:18.572 --> 23:25.529
about our experiences, about our enjoyments,
our happiness, everything.

23:25.730 --> 23:34.341
And not to discuss it and analyze it,
because that would kill the joy completely.

23:36.152 --> 23:39.571
There’s no joy in it.

23:39.772 --> 23:44.380
Discussion is just trying to show that
you know better than the other,

23:44.581 --> 23:51.019
or you can give another opinion. In Sahaja
Yoga there is no another opinion.

23:51.519 --> 23:58.621
If somebody has a Nabhi, he has a Nabhi,
what another opinion you can have?

24:01.484 --> 24:10.530
So then we finish with different kinds
of arguments and discussions and things.

24:10.731 --> 24:17.146
Maybe somebody goes off the track, maybe.

24:17.347 --> 24:23.108
But you all know he is going off the track,
so what’s the use of discussing it?

24:23.806 --> 24:27.174
You all know what he is talking is off
the track, so it’s all right.

24:27.375 --> 24:30.886
You come to the conclusion, “Yeah, we know,
we know, we know”.

24:31.087 --> 24:37.073
But to discuss it out, there is no need.

24:37.274 --> 24:43.374
Once you know and it is in your awareness,
the Paramchaitanya will take care of it

24:43.575 --> 24:47.465
and you won’t have to bother at all

24:47.666 --> 24:52.805
how to correct, how to mend it, what to do.

24:53.847 --> 25:01.163
That’s not your work. You just leave it
to Paramchaitanya and it will work out.

25:03.540 --> 25:08.249
So here we have come because this country
has been very much blessed

25:08.450 --> 25:16.196
by so many saints and yogis, and you can
see it in the people how they are.

25:17.213 --> 25:22.098
And that’s why, despite all poverty,
despite all kinds of discomforts,

25:22.299 --> 25:31.583
and despite the fact that they have not
known any Western great things,

25:31.784 --> 25:35.827
they are not bothered.

25:37.792 --> 25:43.268
I went to Russia, of course Russia was
great and so many got realization.

25:43.469 --> 25:50.142
And I was really surprised how these people
have come to Sahaja Yoga

25:51.632 --> 25:59.164
and accepted it. But one part was
very funny,

25:59.365 --> 26:04.123
which was I would say, like the villagers
of this country.

26:04.324 --> 26:11.122
Those who are still not so matured would
not come to Sahaja Yoga as such,

26:11.323 --> 26:17.185
but the difference of their character
was really remarkable,

26:17.386 --> 26:21.937
because - you are going by a taxi.

26:22.326 --> 26:28.395
So the taxi fellow says, “Have you got
a Marlboro cigarette with you?”.

26:29.834 --> 26:32.359
I said, “What is that? I have never
known of it”.

26:32.560 --> 26:38.468
“No, if you have one then we’ll take you
free, or we’ll charge you very little”.

26:38.669 --> 26:41.981
But an Indian will never say such a thing,
he doesn’t know all these things,

26:42.182 --> 26:44.985
he’s not bothered.

26:45.429 --> 26:49.232
But if an Indian taxi fellow is going,
he’ll say,

26:49.433 --> 26:53.850
“Have you got a photograph of Mataji
with you?”.

26:58.905 --> 27:01.737
That’s a big difference!

27:10.441 --> 27:14.562
In every aspect I have seen that this
another -

27:14.763 --> 27:19.543
like there are villagers here, people who
are not Sahaja Yogis,

27:19.744 --> 27:23.573
but they respect, they respect the saint.

27:23.774 --> 27:28.166
To them saint is more important than
anything else.

27:29.692 --> 27:34.768
Nobody will ask you for anything – never!

27:35.053 --> 27:39.352
Even if you want to give them, they will
not accept.

27:41.442 --> 27:45.651
They may cheat you, some people who
are selling things,

27:45.852 --> 27:49.868
but they will never ask from you that,
“You give me this, you give me that”,

27:50.069 --> 27:52.770
that’s not done.

27:53.239 --> 27:59.579
So the, basically I think there is a
difference which we should understand,

27:59.951 --> 28:09.701
that materialism works much faster
in the West than in India, much faster.

28:11.225 --> 28:18.313
And one has to be careful on that point.
I’m bringing you down to that point now -

28:19.435 --> 28:26.306
that, are we getting lost into materialism?

28:29.827 --> 28:32.267
Of course you know I’m a great shopper,

28:32.468 --> 28:37.243
I have to go on shopping, shopping,
shopping, shopping.

28:37.444 --> 28:43.070
And I shop for all of you, and I have been
shopping, no doubt.

28:44.136 --> 28:50.585
But the difference between My shopping
and the shopping of so many is this –

28:50.786 --> 28:54.447
that if I’m shopping I am going there

28:54.648 --> 28:58.728
because I know I’ll get things much
cheaper, much better.

28:58.929 --> 29:04.147
All the good things will be there available
because I’m there – I’m sure of that;

29:04.348 --> 29:09.861
and all the best qualities will be
available very easily,

29:10.784 --> 29:17.870
and that I will be able to get things

29:18.071 --> 29:23.628
for people, because I’ll remember all
of them for whom I have to buy.

29:24.162 --> 29:27.427
It always happens like that.

29:28.859 --> 29:34.679
When I go out for shopping, even if I have
to face four hundred people,

29:34.880 --> 29:41.401
I get the things there all right.
That’s why I have to go.

29:44.033 --> 29:49.376
All right, if you have to go then you have
to think, “What we are going to buy?”.

29:49.577 --> 29:55.009
I have seen invariably Sahaja Yogis
will buy

29:55.210 --> 29:59.110
things for non-Sahaja Yogis, always,
mostly.

29:59.311 --> 30:04.504
“I’m buying for my mother, my sister
who is against Sahaja Yoga”.

30:04.705 --> 30:09.414
Why should you buy for somebody who is
against Sahaja Yoga?

30:09.615 --> 30:15.073
Even if they might be your nearest
relations,

30:16.333 --> 30:19.775
do you think they deserve it?

30:22.184 --> 30:28.093
So then we have to know that we are
one body,

30:28.294 --> 30:31.620
and as this hand must look after
the other hand,

30:31.821 --> 30:36.029
when we go out shopping or do anything,
we should always think

30:36.230 --> 30:41.265
what we are going to buy for other
Sahaja Yogis.

30:41.466 --> 30:44.546
Of course, I have told you that, unless
and until somebody is your sister

30:44.747 --> 30:49.297
by rakhi or anything, you need not give
presents.

30:50.555 --> 30:55.519
But women can buy for women, men can
buy for men.

30:55.720 --> 30:59.491
Just understand one small thing –

30:59.692 --> 31:03.717
that the matter is for expression
of our love, that’s all.

31:03.918 --> 31:09.209
It has no other meaning. I don’t find
any meaning into it.

31:12.999 --> 31:16.313
So instead of buying for… when we,
people travel from here

31:16.514 --> 31:22.060
they go as traders, I’ve seen. Of course
you come as traders also –

31:22.261 --> 31:28.910
but that’s something Dharmic. But when
you go from here you go as traders,

31:29.111 --> 31:32.472
and for whom are you buying?

31:34.259 --> 31:40.732
Your relationships are no more with
anybody else but Sahaja Yogis,

31:40.933 --> 31:44.627
and only Sahaja Yogis.

31:48.221 --> 31:51.945
Whether they are Indians,

31:53.313 --> 32:00.637
English, Chinese, Swiss, French, Spanish,

32:01.417 --> 32:13.823
Germans, anything they may think to be,
they are Sahaja Yogis,

32:14.024 --> 32:20.989
and they are born in the land which
we call as the Kingdom of God.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.112
So please be careful on this point.

32:24.313 --> 32:29.689
Today being the first day I wanted to
explain to you everything in such a manner

32:29.890 --> 32:32.749
that you remember that we are
on a pilgrimage,

32:32.950 --> 32:38.442
and all of us should be able to grow
our awareness.

32:38.643 --> 32:43.624
If you cannot grow your awareness
it is useless.

32:47.566 --> 32:52.227
Once you start thinking like that,
you’ll be surprised

32:52.428 --> 32:56.860
how much you will gain and how much
you’ll achieve.

33:00.429 --> 33:05.806
There are no do’s and don’ts
in Sahaja Yoga, really,

33:06.007 --> 33:11.532
and I don’t think we have much disciplining
either, of any kind.

33:11.733 --> 33:16.667
But it is Sahaja Yoga which somehow
or other disciplines you,

33:16.868 --> 33:20.654
I don’t have to tell you anything.
It’s like the fire,

33:20.855 --> 33:25.842
if you put your hand into the fire it will
burn you, whether you like it or not.

33:26.043 --> 33:31.871
In the same way, if you do anything asahaj,
you will have to pay for it.

33:32.072 --> 33:35.617
So you know definitely that you don’t
want to lose your vibrations,

33:35.818 --> 33:39.364
you don’t want to become unhappy.

33:39.565 --> 33:44.011
But this time with a very deeper
understanding and reverence

33:44.212 --> 33:50.304
to your Self and to your ascent,

33:50.505 --> 34:04.026
you have to take a very joyful,
serious attitude.

34:04.543 --> 34:11.099
I’m sure this time you all are going
to just enjoy your Self.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.141
May God bless you.
