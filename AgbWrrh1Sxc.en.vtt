00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:08.016
So now, there are two very nice tapes we have got,

00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:15.903
the first one is called as ‘Bandagi’ and

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:24.040
which are lyrics composed by my brother,

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.959
we call him Babamama, but his name is Hemendra Kumar.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.879
I have given him a name called ‘Belos’, meaning ‘the pure’,

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:54.886
he has composed all these poems here and

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:05.570
Mr. Prabhakar Dhakre, who we call as Guruji has,

00:01:15.182 --> 00:01:22.404
is the one who has done all the musical part of it

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.968
and the musicians are here Suresh Wardkar, Uttara Kelkar,

00:01:28.993 --> 00:01:33.814
Chaya, Sarita Bhave and Sanjay Talwar.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.209
I think you have heard it but

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:40.653
this was not with so many of these

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:42.740
so now we have got them

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:46.595
and for which the money is to be collected there.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.458
Philip, you are doing the whole selling?

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:54.437
Wolfgang is selling it.

00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:58.037
So, you can get it from him and later on

00:01:58.062 --> 00:02:01.567
also we will carry them with us if some remains

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:04.104
later on for other Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:10.034
So, I declare it as inaugurated, for the inauguration of this thing

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.280
I declare it as ‘being inaugurated’.

00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:26.659
You must know my brother is a chartered accountant

00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:33.367
and I cannot understand, he suddenly became such a great poet

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:36.772
because I never knew he had this talent

00:02:36.797 --> 00:02:38.480
and he never composed any poems

00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:42.161
but just after realization all these beautiful things

00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:45.423
have come out and specially in Urdu language

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:47.560
which he did not know,

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:49.815
Urdu language he did not know much,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.024
I know little bit but not much myself

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.614
but suddenly the whole thing has started pouring out of him

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.200
and he has now become such a master poet.

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:03.028
I don’t know this is the miracle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:23.431
Now this is another one from Sanjay Talwar,

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.003
he is the one,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.579
he calls it as ‘Roohani Roshni’

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:45.770
meaning the ‘light of Spirit’ or we can say ‘Spiritual light’

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:49.330
and is composed by him,

00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:58.666
the thing is, he has also suddenly become,

00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.217
he also became suddenly a poet.

00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:12.469
He is a chemical engineer

00:04:12.494 --> 00:04:15.415
and suddenly you find a chemical engineer

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.343
becoming a poet through Sahaja Yoga

00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:30.578
and his voice has also become so deep,

00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:35.824
it’s beyond me to understand how he has done this,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.695
he calls himself, he is called as ‘Roshan’

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.505
means ‘Enlightened One’,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.960
actually his name is Sanjay but he calls himself Roshan

00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:51.371
so is all done by him, lyrics

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:54.071
and voices but the music is done by

00:04:54.096 --> 00:04:59.643
a very famous music director called Sapan Jagmohan from India.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.241
Now the people who have sung here is Kavita Krishnamurthy,

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:04.706
she is a very famous

00:05:04.731 --> 00:05:08.886
background singer then there is Jagmohan himself

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:11.198
and the two sisters you know them,

00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:15.061
Bakre sisters from Pune also have sung in this one.

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:17.726
So, this is the second one which also

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.290
I declare as open now to you

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:27.262
for you to purchase it and now

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:30.650
I have done the inauguration of these two things.

00:05:41.997 --> 00:05:43.737
Now there is one thing to be realized

00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:45.755
I want to make it very clear to you,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.775
to make this music they have to go to studios

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.223
which are very expensive and they have to employ the people

00:05:52.248 --> 00:05:53.960
who belong to the studio itself

00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:56.455
and it’s a very expensive process

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.512
and that’s why we had to put the price

00:05:58.537 --> 00:06:02.561
to cover up their expenses plus the amount that is spent

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:10.195
in doing them up on cassettes and the recording of it.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.828
 So, all that amount we have included

00:06:12.853 --> 00:06:14.999
and it’s all with my consent and

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:17.782
my understanding the price has been put.

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:23.045
So, there should be no problem in buying those things,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.835
it’s perfectly all right, all of them

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.600
I have seen them very well.

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:30.457
Now they are going to give you some music

00:06:30.482 --> 00:06:33.697
and after that you people also give them some music

00:06:33.722 --> 00:06:36.805
and then again, they will end up with the music.

00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:49.695
There is a little thing I have to tell you

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.055
that you can see how Sahaja Yoga can transform people.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.677
Every one of them has gone into a new dimension.

00:06:58.702 --> 00:07:03.134
I could see today even when they were playing

00:07:03.182 --> 00:07:07.192
tabla and all that I found everybody has gone into

00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:10.931
a new dimension of expertise.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.598
It’s very surprising.

00:07:12.623 --> 00:07:16.745
Their voices are so deep and beautiful that

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.109
if that is the gift of the Spirit,

00:07:20.515 --> 00:07:23.263
the world will know very soon how important

00:07:23.288 --> 00:07:28.068
it is to achieve your Spirit and to be established into it

00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:30.993
because you really become dynamic.

00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:45.180
So, we have to say goodbye to you

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:51.566
and Guru Puja was done with such great devotion,

00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:56.760
dedication, and enthusiasm and also

00:07:56.785 --> 00:08:00.440
with the grace of God all the artists also arrived.

00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:03.868
There was no chance of their coming till yesterday

00:08:04.447 --> 00:08:07.693
and everything managed so well that they are here.

00:08:08.873 --> 00:08:13.907
You all have also enjoyed the whole thing.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.907
Go with your enjoyment.

00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:23.304
Today you must have learnt that the Guru teaches you

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:25.415
how to enjoy everything.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.433
I hope you have learnt how to enjoy everything

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:34.595
and to enjoy your life and spirituality,

00:08:34.893 --> 00:08:38.053
so that you live in eternal life.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.774
May God bless you all.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.255
Thank you very much.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.501
May God bless you.
