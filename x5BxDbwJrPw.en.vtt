00:04.412 --> 00:09.825
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

00:14.469 --> 00:20.027
First, I used to bow to all the seekers of the Truth

00:24.185 --> 00:29.290
and today, all those seekers of Truth

00:30.755 --> 00:37.011
have shown that truth is love, and love is truth.

00:38.847 --> 00:45.094
With the power of love, you have been able to establish

00:45.903 --> 00:52.626
a beautiful place for Sahaja Yoga in England.

01:00.501 --> 01:08.641
I must congratulate you all for fulfilling your desire

01:09.833 --> 01:16.502
so beautifully, working it out together  and

01:20.347 --> 01:27.651
and the collectivity

01:28.389 --> 01:34.213
which you have achieved – not only in England, but all over the world.

01:35.538 --> 01:42.259
All of you feel so responsible that Shudy Camps

01:43.657 --> 01:48.803
should be a perfect piece of art,

01:50.065 --> 01:52.390
the perfect piece of love,

01:52.866 --> 01:59.366
perfect piece of peaceful atmosphere.

02:08.102 --> 02:12.043
There’s dedication, no doubt,

02:12.782 --> 02:19.255
but apart from dedication, the collective oneness, the integration

02:21.267 --> 02:28.272
of your feelings is beautifully demonstrated.

02:31.039 --> 02:36.642
Even Indians wanted to send you something

02:37.419 --> 02:44.350
for Shudy Camps and it was not ready before I left,

02:44.999 --> 02:51.083
so they were saying that they will be able to give you
when you come there for your tours.

02:51.595 --> 02:57.723
Every country wanted to express their love.

03:04.248 --> 03:10.652
They say love begets love; I loved you, no doubt,

03:11.724 --> 03:19.731
but in so many faces, when you see the reflection of that Divine Love,

03:23.456 --> 03:29.260
it is multiplied beyond My expectation.

03:30.982 --> 03:35.945
I cannot describe My joy:

03:36.468 --> 03:43.468
you can sing, dance, jump,  say “Jai” – I also feel like saying your “Jai”,

03:47.162 --> 03:49.569
and singing like …

03:53.522 --> 03:57.276
This is the beginning of our collective effort

03:57.576 --> 04:02.517
and we have to go further and further with this.

04:03.676 --> 04:10.676
Tomorrow is a great day for Me, as well as for you –

04:12.570 --> 04:17.903
it has to be one step forward;

04:19.354 --> 04:27.392
very substantial step forward and you must be looking forward to it.

04:29.024 --> 04:36.266
I am sure something will work out in the inner building of Shudy Camps,

04:37.452 --> 04:40.531
in every Sahaja Yogi’s heart.

04:42.499 --> 04:48.328
All that is expressed outside has to be expressed within,

04:49.035 --> 04:51.428
and that is what we have to achieve.

04:52.505 --> 04:54.991
May God bless you!
