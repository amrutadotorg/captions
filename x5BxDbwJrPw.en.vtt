00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:09.825
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.027
First, I used to bow to all the seekers of the Truth

00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:29.290
and today, all those seekers of Truth

00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:37.011
have shown that truth is love, and love is truth.

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:45.094
With the power of love, you have been able to establish

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:52.626
a beautiful place for Sahaja Yoga in England.

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:08.641
I must congratulate you all for fulfilling your desire

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:16.502
so beautifully, working it out together  and

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:27.651
and the collectivity

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:34.213
which you have achieved – not only in England, but all over the world.

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:42.259
All of you feel so responsible that Shudy Camps

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:48.803
should be a perfect piece of art,

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:52.390
the perfect piece of love,

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:59.366
perfect piece of peaceful atmosphere.

00:02:08.102 --> 00:02:12.043
There’s dedication, no doubt,

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:19.255
but apart from dedication, the collective oneness, the integration

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:28.272
of your feelings is beautifully demonstrated.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:36.642
Even Indians wanted to send you something

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:44.350
for Shudy Camps and it was not ready before I left,

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:51.083
so they were saying that they will be able to give you
when you come there for your tours.

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:57.723
Every country wanted to express their love.

00:03:04.248 --> 00:03:10.652
They say love begets love; I loved you, no doubt,

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:19.731
but in so many faces, when you see the reflection of that Divine Love,

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:29.260
it is multiplied beyond My expectation.

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:35.945
I cannot describe My joy:

00:03:36.468 --> 00:03:43.468
you can sing, dance, jump,  say “Jai” – I also feel like saying your “Jai”,

00:03:47.162 --> 00:03:49.569
and singing like …

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:57.276
This is the beginning of our collective effort

00:03:57.576 --> 00:04:02.517
and we have to go further and further with this.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:10.676
Tomorrow is a great day for Me, as well as for you –

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.903
it has to be one step forward;

00:04:19.354 --> 00:04:27.392
very substantial step forward and you must be looking forward to it.

00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:36.266
I am sure something will work out in the inner building of Shudy Camps,

00:04:37.452 --> 00:04:40.531
in every Sahaja Yogi’s heart.

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:48.328
All that is expressed outside has to be expressed within,

00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:51.428
and that is what we have to achieve.

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:54.991
May God bless you!
