00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.804
Today we have decided to have Krishna Puja

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:13.629
because America is the Krishna bhoomi.

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:24.780
It’s very surprising that such a great
incarnation of Shri Krishna

00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:36.558
came even much later than Rama and has
sent His special people to live in America.

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:44.422
Of course, there are many who are seeking
in this country, no doubt.

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:48.948
But there are many who are also misleading
them.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:58.257
That’s how you find, despite all our
effort, we have not been able

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:03.769
to expand Sahaja Yoga very much.

00:01:07.112 --> 00:01:13.683
What one has to learn from His life
is very, very important.

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:20.397
The first and foremost thing He taught
was collectivity.

00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:26.770
He used to get hold of small boys

00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:33.500
and play with them together.

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:39.546
Rama didn't do that.

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:45.544
He used to get hold of ladies

00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:55.014
who were selling milk and also butter,

00:01:55.226 --> 00:02:03.261
those who used to go to fill their waters -
water in the pitcher.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.386
He is the one who collected all such people
in the village of Gokul.

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:27.646
He played all kinds of pranks on His
friends

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:34.192
and His mother and the mother’s friends.

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:39.690
Behaved just like a very naughty child,

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:48.310
just to show that He was just like
all of us.

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:54.715
As you know, He was the incarnation
of Shri Vishnu.

00:02:54.916 --> 00:03:05.334
First Shri Rama was born, took incarnation
as Shri Rama,

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:14.215
which was in the Aryan race, means that
time we had

00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:23.763
an Aryan race which was sort of superior,
superior race than others.

00:03:23.964 --> 00:03:30.948
But when He came as Krishna, He took
His birth

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.407
in Yadav dynasty, you can call it.

00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:46.876
They were not superior, they were selling
milk, having cowherds

00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:57.024
and doing work not of any religious style.

00:03:57.422 --> 00:04:03.220
But they were innocent simple people
living in the villages,

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:11.897
and they saw the great miracles
of Shri Krishna’s childhood.

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:16.913
He killed demons. He killed Pootana.

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:23.989
All these people were sent by His uncle
Kamsa to kill him.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.261
It was to be, because He had to prove that
He was the incarnation

00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:35.794
of Shri Vishnu and He did it.

00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:41.474
As a child, how He killed those people
is remarkable.

00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:47.180
And how He made them out though they were
all camouflaged.

00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:55.126
In these modern times, difficult for people
to believe

00:04:55.327 --> 00:05:01.450
that there could have been any incarnation
like Shri Krishna.

00:05:01.752 --> 00:05:12.635
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have method
of absolutely establishing the truth

00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:18.451
that Shri Krishna was there ruling
on the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:23.926
From His childhood, you can see He was
fond of collectivity.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.015
And He tried to create collectivity
of people

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:35.669
who were very simple, uneducated,
good-hearted people.

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:39.948
And that is His special quality.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:48.339
And all the people of that village knew Him
very well, all cared for Him.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.060
And when He had to go,

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:59.786
they felt very sad and all of them came
running and crying for Him.

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:03.792
It was a small boy who was going.

00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:10.187
After all, what is there? A little boy
from the village is going.

00:06:10.388 --> 00:06:15.028
The whole village had gathered
to cry for Him.

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:26.213
That is what we all Sahaja Yogis have
to know.

00:06:26.414 --> 00:06:33.403
As a child also, He was a very collective
personality.

00:06:33.604 --> 00:06:36.232
He actually emits collectiveness.

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:42.246
The collective consciousness that you enjoy
is because of His bliss.

00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:54.311
I find that Americans are very collective
in the sense,

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:59.020
they are more bothered about other
countries than about their own.

00:06:59.221 --> 00:07:07.390
They want to go all the way to Vietnam,
now to Iraq, now to some other place.

00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:13.071
Going all over the world, they try
to correct.

00:07:13.272 --> 00:07:21.432
But their own country they do not see
what's wrong. It's so divided.

00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:29.885
Mainly divided on race, racial
discrimination,

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:39.449
is divided by religions and all of these
are just concepts

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:45.036
which they have accepted and are fighting
among themselves.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:51.502
Now after all these,

00:07:53.212 --> 00:08:02.355
there are people who believe they are born
criminals and they should be criminals.

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:09.537
And their criminality is going very far.

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:17.561
They are gangsters. Even small children
have become gangsters.

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:23.241
But the worst part is that the, these
little boys also,

00:08:23.442 --> 00:08:31.084
including others, all these criminals are
regarded as big heroes.

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:42.221
I have seen once, a young boy wearing
a shirt

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:46.512
with another young boy’s photograph
over it.

00:08:47.213 --> 00:08:50.422
So he told Me - I said, “Who is this?”
“You don’t know?

00:08:50.623 --> 00:08:53.818
Very famous gangster is he”, he said.

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:57.737
At the age of thirteen years he is
a very famous gangster

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:02.732
and this boy is very proudly putting up
that -

00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:09.488
like a big hero, or you can call it
like a God there.

00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:21.581
So see the perversion to what limit
Shri Krishna's blessings have been used.

00:09:22.116 --> 00:09:26.173
That's why this country is very difficult.

00:09:28.536 --> 00:09:35.443
One after another there has been attack
of negativity.

00:09:35.644 --> 00:09:40.603
For example, first thing started
by Christians,

00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:44.134
who said that Jews killed Christ.

00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:49.973
He never - It’s not true, it’s not true.
He was never killed by Jews.

00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:56.686
“Christ was killed by Jews”, is a false
statement, absolutely.

00:09:56.887 --> 00:10:04.905
Christ was not killed by Jews. How can
a multitude kill a man?

00:10:05.113 --> 00:10:15.970
It’s the law there. The Romans, or we can
call the Roman law crucified Him.

00:10:16.876 --> 00:10:23.784
So the Christians started nicely torturing
the Jews, because Christ was killed.

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:30.101
I don’t know how to explain this such
absurd idea.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:36.863
Now somebody was killed so many years back,
and now what’s the use of killing

00:10:37.064 --> 00:10:42.834
some grandchildren of those people or great
grandchildren of those people?

00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:46.788
But they did not, the Jews did not.

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:54.669
Still this concept was there that
the Jews killed.

00:10:55.082 --> 00:11:04.956
And the Christians felt they have a right
to torture the Jews.

00:11:05.157 --> 00:11:09.167
So when the Jews came here, they were
never given a good position,

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:13.512
they were tortured very much and troubled
very much.

00:11:13.713 --> 00:11:18.322
It happened everywhere but very much
more here.

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:24.996
So among Jews now came out some devils,
like Freud.

00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:37.307
And he said, “All right. We must shatter
these Christians absolutely.

00:11:37.617 --> 00:11:40.629
Their moral roots must be finished.”

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:50.513
So he started his own psychology to destroy
the Christians.

00:11:50.714 --> 00:11:54.749
And Christians stupidly accepted.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:12:08.509
They did whatever he said, experimented
whatever he did.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:16.803
When I was once in Switzerland, two girls
came and they were shaking in the program.

00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:21.384
I couldn't understand. I called them.
I said, "Why are you shaking?"

00:12:21.698 --> 00:12:35.512
So they said that, "Actually we are very
much degree holders in Freudian knowledge

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:39.707
and we have done all experiments of Freud."

00:12:39.908 --> 00:12:46.858
“And then why are you shaking?” “Because
we have power to shake!” How about that?

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:56.716
So they followed this Freud and this
vindictiveness that was there

00:12:56.917 --> 00:13:01.606
was not seen by anyone, even by Jews.

00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:14.314
As a result we had people who were deadly
against each other

00:13:14.515 --> 00:13:18.798
and ruining each other, destroying
each other.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:27.460
Then this Black and White business started.

00:13:28.538 --> 00:13:32.921
All kinds of theories people are putting up

00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:39.798
to show that the Blacks are bad or
the Whites are bad.

00:13:40.733 --> 00:13:44.424
The difference is only skin-deep.

00:13:44.938 --> 00:13:49.220
If you want you can cut the skin and see
for yourself.

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:55.278
Inside body is the same. But it was so.

00:13:55.479 --> 00:14:03.839
This divisive method started and it's still
going on.

00:14:05.456 --> 00:14:15.645
I always say, without Blacks, Americans
will be left high and dry.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.482
Look at the talent they have.

00:14:20.524 --> 00:14:24.192
Not only music. Atlanta, I saw,

00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:30.421
all the Blacks were winning and Whites
were not anywhere. Just imagine.

00:14:30.622 --> 00:14:38.413
Very nicely they used to run, very swiftly
at the end of it, you see.

00:14:38.614 --> 00:14:40.978
And all the Whites were saying,
"Ha, ha, ha."

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:44.985
They were nicely enjoying their position.

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:49.775
You don't have the stamina of the Blacks
also.

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:55.059
So in games also, same thing.

00:14:56.233 --> 00:14:59.571
With all this what is going to happen
to America?

00:14:59.772 --> 00:15:05.252
It's a country which has to be collective
because of Shri Krishna.

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:11.075
All of them are immigrants here. Who is
not an immigrant?

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:15.118
Whether they came earlier or later
doesn't matter.

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:18.766
Thank God, I have told you many-a-times
that Columbus lost his way

00:15:18.967 --> 00:15:23.898
and came here, not to India. Otherwise,
there would have been no Indians left

00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:26.775
and no Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:28.418 --> 00:15:33.270
I think, it was the trick of Hanumana.

00:15:34.153 --> 00:15:39.577
He misled him and Columbus came here.
Thank God.

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:50.881
Now, you are in a country where you have
to be collective.

00:15:51.722 --> 00:15:55.587
Krishna won't spare you unless and until
you are collective

00:15:55.788 --> 00:16:02.218
or you give up this nonsense of skin-deep
differences.

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:13.943
Then religious differences. He had a friend
who was lame by one leg.

00:16:14.152 --> 00:16:17.809
He had some friends who were very black.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:23.107
He had some friends who were quite
Indian white, I should say.

00:16:23.308 --> 00:16:27.269
I shouldn’t say white like you people,
but Indian white.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.546
He had all kinds of colors.

00:16:30.747 --> 00:16:34.279
And He took His own birth in the Yadav
vansha.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:44.738
Though they were milk sellers, milkmen
who used to sell milk to people.

00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:52.204
He didn't take His birth in a very royal
family like Shri Rama.

00:16:52.405 --> 00:17:00.985
Though He was, because later on He became
the king of Dwarika.

00:17:01.739 --> 00:17:09.296
But in His style, in His behavior,
in His life,

00:17:09.598 --> 00:17:16.216
nobody could see that He was a royal
personality.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.848
He could sleep under a tree.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:24.745
He could eat anything that He could get.

00:17:24.946 --> 00:17:28.925
All kinds of sweet, sweet stories you can
read in His life,

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:38.984
showing how He was enjoying His
collectivity, never showing off.

00:17:40.318 --> 00:17:47.380
And His collectivity has to be worked out
in this country.

00:17:47.581 --> 00:17:57.464
Unless and until it is done from your
heart, it's not going to work out.

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:04.445
We had problems like this always with
our collectivity here.

00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:09.196
For example, a lady, you know, she is
a big lady, I think.

00:18:09.397 --> 00:18:12.290
She started correcting people: “Why do
you put here?

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:16.435
This thing is getting dirty. That thing
is this and that.”

00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:23.720
Such a woman should be sometimes sent
to some stable to clean it.

00:18:23.921 --> 00:18:29.046
Then she will give up these nonsensical
ideas that she has.

00:18:29.347 --> 00:18:34.497
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you cannot behave
like this.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:39.739
And this kind of behavior can destroy
Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:40.144 --> 00:18:43.727
Have you ever heard Me saying that,
“This is dirty,

00:18:43.928 --> 00:18:49.464
this is not good, I don’t like this?”.
Did I say, ever?

00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:59.149
First of all, we have to understand,
if we have to be collective,

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:04.154
we should give up these stupid ideas
about ourselves.

00:19:08.587 --> 00:19:14.088
Some people get some position, may be
some money,

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:18.728
maybe, I would say, have a background.

00:19:18.929 --> 00:19:23.588
If you are sticking on to it then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:26.916
You are saints!

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.765
You cannot be demanding.

00:19:33.494 --> 00:19:38.993
You have to give, and give, and give.

00:19:39.364 --> 00:19:42.703
Whatever may be your position in life,

00:19:43.306 --> 00:19:48.986
if that can overpower you then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:19:54.062 --> 00:20:02.915
Shri Krishna, who is the Virat, who is
the great primordial personality,

00:20:03.945 --> 00:20:11.400
didn't show any such signs of His
greatness.

00:20:13.675 --> 00:20:16.483
But Americans have a speciality to show

00:20:16.684 --> 00:20:21.778
that they are something outstandingly
great.

00:20:22.685 --> 00:20:26.894
But Sahaja Yogis, please don't learn
those things.

00:20:27.095 --> 00:20:30.809
You have to make others unlearn.

00:20:34.592 --> 00:20:41.352
If that cannot happen, it's better to leave
Sahaja Yoga for ever.

00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:51.856
Such people will make everyone miserable
and destroy Sahaja Yoga in America.

00:20:53.278 --> 00:21:00.874
Even about protocol, you should become
timeless.

00:21:03.004 --> 00:21:06.149
Absolutely timeless.

00:21:06.357 --> 00:21:11.037
Now, if you are particular about time,

00:21:11.238 --> 00:21:16.347
Shri Krishna will play His tricks and your
timing will be finished.

00:21:16.548 --> 00:21:19.217
Happened yesterday.

00:21:25.353 --> 00:21:31.771
So, one has to know that time is your slave

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:38.720
and you don't have to be the slave
of time - if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:45.857
Otherwise, you are not. That means
you are guided not by the Divine.

00:21:46.429 --> 00:21:52.711
The Divine works out everything very well.
But for whom? For Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:57.465
But if you are not Sahaja Yogis,
you'll topple down.

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:09.899
In every way we should find out what things
we have accumulated among ourselves

00:22:10.154 --> 00:22:13.505
which is not Shri Krishna's quality.

00:22:15.118 --> 00:22:24.889
Now, Shri Krishna used to steal as a child,
the butter from the ladies, why?

00:22:25.413 --> 00:22:31.808
Why did He steal the butter? Because
they were selling it

00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:39.923
to the military of Kamsa, His uncle,
who was a devil.

00:22:41.337 --> 00:22:46.255
They used to go all the way to sell him
in Mathura.

00:22:46.731 --> 00:22:52.656
So He used to steal it, because children
needed it, and giving it to children.

00:22:52.857 --> 00:22:57.700
He didn’t like this idea – why should it go

00:22:58.261 --> 00:23:06.506
to these horrible rakshasas of Mathura.

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:11.106
Just the opposite in is America.

00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:18.669
All the false gurus, all the rakshasas come
here and they get all the butter.

00:23:22.591 --> 00:23:31.692
As if people have no brains to understand,

00:23:32.253 --> 00:23:38.324
while Shri Krishna is the brain
of the Virat.

00:23:39.046 --> 00:23:41.752
But here you find that people have
no brains.

00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:47.263
Anybody comes, says something, they:
“Ah, ha, ha, great.”

00:23:47.878 --> 00:23:50.408
Somebody talks big - all right.

00:23:50.609 --> 00:23:53.668
They’ll give away their money. They’ll give
away their houses.

00:23:53.869 --> 00:24:00.252
Their children they’ll remove from the
school – for something extremely stupid.

00:24:02.448 --> 00:24:09.469
While He is the brain in the body
of Virata.

00:24:10.792 --> 00:24:14.865
So this kind of brainlessness comes

00:24:15.571 --> 00:24:20.715
and we really start, even Sahaja Yogis
start behaving in a manner

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:24.271
that shows they are really brainless.

00:24:30.532 --> 00:24:36.780
Apart from that, He is Kubera. He is
the God of wealth.

00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:40.828
That's why there is wealth in this country.

00:24:41.454 --> 00:24:44.446
But this wealth is all becoming debts,
you see,

00:24:44.647 --> 00:24:48.813
because of the special brains of Americans.

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:54.678
They are so stupid that whatever is selling
in the market,

00:24:54.879 --> 00:24:57.098
whether they need it or not, they'll buy.

00:24:57.299 --> 00:25:05.531
Take loan, again take loan, take loan
till they are absolutely indebted.

00:25:05.732 --> 00:25:13.016
Now here in the country of Kubera you
should be really rich.

00:25:13.217 --> 00:25:20.131
Rich doesn't mean just to have bank
balance, but means by temperament.

00:25:23.093 --> 00:25:26.059
Now it's much better but once upon a time,

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:32.399
Americans were the most miserly
Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:32.896 --> 00:25:39.302
They used to send Me candles as present
and I used to hide that.

00:25:41.781 --> 00:25:45.482
I said, "Baba why do you send candles,
even? Don't send anything,

00:25:45.683 --> 00:25:48.817
because everybody is going to see
those candles

00:25:49.018 --> 00:25:53.396
and what are they going to say about it,
that candles have been sent."

00:25:55.061 --> 00:25:59.642
Now, this I am talking for introspection.

00:25:59.895 --> 00:26:09.866
Are we collective? Are we willing to share
everything that we have?

00:26:13.179 --> 00:26:18.590
Do we look down upon people who come
from other countries?

00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:22.292
Do we have racialism in us?

00:26:22.785 --> 00:26:25.650
Thirty-five Sahaja Yogis came from
Australia

00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:30.312
to America as if this is some Hajj.

00:26:30.513 --> 00:26:34.251
They went back with very bad vibrations.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.185
Out of them half were thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:38.386 --> 00:26:45.011
Imagine, Australia is the country where
they used to send all the criminals.

00:26:47.627 --> 00:26:54.370
So first and foremost, to judge yourself
is to see your vibrations.

00:26:55.212 --> 00:26:58.693
That you should meditate and judge
your vibrations

00:26:58.894 --> 00:27:02.933
if you are really collective or not.

00:27:05.106 --> 00:27:10.355
Because you are not like that, Sahaja Yoga
does not spread.

00:27:11.434 --> 00:27:16.560
I have seen people from Hare Rama
Hare Krishna.

00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:25.623
Poor things have found nothing. They get up
at four o'clock,

00:27:25.824 --> 00:27:31.613
start their Hare Rama Hare Krishna bhajan -
four o'clock. Alright.

00:27:31.814 --> 00:27:37.778
Then the whole day they wear a very thin
dhoti in which they are shivering.

00:27:37.979 --> 00:27:42.525
They shave their heads and put a very…

00:27:42.726 --> 00:27:47.164
pig’s tail here which is bought
in the market.

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:53.958
If you see their dedication you'll be
surprised.

00:27:54.159 --> 00:28:01.529
How they are so much dedicated, when they
haven't found anything whatsoever?

00:28:02.008 --> 00:28:06.929
What about the nuns? You see them,
you’ll be amazed.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:13.044
One fellow came from the Catholic Church
to us.

00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:20.268
He was trying to be a priest. He said,
“Mother, Sahaja Yog –

00:28:20.469 --> 00:28:23.262
you don’t do anything, anything.” I said,
“What do you want to do?”

00:28:23.463 --> 00:28:30.007
“You know, there we could not eat any
meat on Fridays.

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:34.782
On Saturdays, we could not drink anything.

00:28:34.983 --> 00:28:41.835
Then on Sundays, the whole day we had
to fast and pray to God."

00:28:42.036 --> 00:28:44.668
"Then - what about the rest of the time?"

00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:53.479
"The rest of the time, we had to remember
Bible by heart and then recite it.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:29:01.083
And if we made even one mistake, the father
would give us a nice beating.”

00:29:03.207 --> 00:29:11.067
That's another problem with Sahaja Yoga
because it is Shri Krishna's play.

00:29:11.924 --> 00:29:17.998
It's so simple. You don't have to do
anything of the kind.

00:29:18.855 --> 00:29:24.263
No disciplining, nothing. Left to you,
you are your own master.

00:29:24.464 --> 00:29:27.467
You are your own guru.

00:29:29.186 --> 00:29:32.384
But these things which are lingering
in your mind,

00:29:32.593 --> 00:29:36.065
which are just the opposite of Shri
Krishna’s life,

00:29:36.266 --> 00:29:39.413
which you have acquired in this country,

00:29:39.614 --> 00:29:44.034
are still there, here and there, here
and there left.

00:29:46.846 --> 00:29:54.710
Some of the people are really still
so much busy with themselves.

00:29:54.919 --> 00:30:00.868
They look so pale, thin – I tell you,
I can’t believe they are Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:09.632
So when we see Shri Krishna's life,
the way He lived.

00:30:10.711 --> 00:30:17.839
And then He went to help the Pandavas.

00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:25.739
He told Arjuna that, "I can be your
charioteer.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:31.076
I can drive your chariot. But I will
not fight."

00:30:32.196 --> 00:30:37.933
Arjuna knew that He was all-powerful,
if He is there everything will work out.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.652
“And all My army I’ll give to Kauravas,
to seek the balance.”

00:30:44.377 --> 00:30:46.536
He said, "All right."

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:53.508
He didn't fight to show off, I am this,
I am that.

00:30:53.709 --> 00:30:59.120
Like here: “Mother, I am the leader”.
Eh?

00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:04.681
“I am the leader.” “Can’t hear, I can’t
hear you.”

00:31:07.688 --> 00:31:10.942
"Mother, I am this."

00:31:11.628 --> 00:31:14.398
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:16.219 --> 00:31:20.276
It's a very great name that you have
achieved.

00:31:20.477 --> 00:31:28.412
The highest position you have achieved.
There’s nothing more to be achieved.

00:31:30.003 --> 00:31:34.094
Like somebody asked Me, “Mother,
the Indians in India never catch.

00:31:34.295 --> 00:31:39.086
Why do we go on catching all the time?”
I said, “Because Indians in India

00:31:39.287 --> 00:31:42.253
know they have achieved it now.
Nothing to be achieved.

00:31:42.454 --> 00:31:46.891
And you want to have God’s Realization –
I don’t know what other Realization.”

00:31:47.092 --> 00:31:49.625
They don't think like that.

00:31:50.977 --> 00:31:56.591
They say, "We have achieved now. We are
in the sea. It's for us to swim over."

00:32:01.082 --> 00:32:06.220
All these things some of you have crossed
over, some of you

00:32:06.421 --> 00:32:10.581
have absolutely lost them. But some of you
are still there.

00:32:10.797 --> 00:32:13.798
They are the most dangerous thing
as Christ has said,

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:17.709
"Be careful of the murmuring souls."

00:32:23.033 --> 00:32:28.723
I don't know how to stop this little
rat-like people,

00:32:28.924 --> 00:32:32.631
who are cutting the nest of Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:40.099
I've been reported about many and I am
really shocked.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:47.384
After so many years of My visit how can
people talk ill of each other

00:32:47.585 --> 00:32:50.769
and can create these problems?

00:32:53.401 --> 00:33:01.264
Shri Krishna's friendship is well known,
you know with Sudama how He behaved.

00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:11.327
All His beautiful manifestations must show
in your character.

00:33:11.528 --> 00:33:15.511
Then only this country can be saved.

00:33:15.712 --> 00:33:22.483
I must say it’s – now here we have Canada,
we have people also,

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:32.225
I am told from Austria. From all over,
from England.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.987
But still, we are not so many people
as we should have been.

00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:44.955
If you just take Austrians, they must be
double of this.

00:33:46.488 --> 00:33:50.618
If they could do it, why can't we do it?

00:33:51.798 --> 00:33:58.977
Because we do not introspect and we do
not grow out of our egos.

00:34:00.044 --> 00:34:04.163
They will say that, "Why didn't Krishna
meditate?"

00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:07.969
You have to meditate on Shri Krishna.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.941
If He meditates what will happen
to you all?

00:34:18.647 --> 00:34:20.723
On the whole, I was very happy with
yesterday -

00:34:20.924 --> 00:34:29.150
the other day’s program, somehow.
Despite, as usual, in New York,

00:34:29.363 --> 00:34:38.709
our inability to really do good
advertising, unsystematic everything.

00:34:39.748 --> 00:34:45.436
Despite that we had so many people and
I put the responsibility on them.

00:34:45.637 --> 00:34:51.722
Because that's the thing - it is Shri
Krishna's responsibility.

00:34:53.922 --> 00:34:58.633
And that is what is your responsibility
now.

00:34:58.834 --> 00:35:09.199
You are responsible for America and Canada,
South America.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.805
You all are responsible and you people
should be such

00:35:15.006 --> 00:35:22.599
that people who see you, listen to you,
are with you,

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:29.032
should know that these are the Gopa
and Gopis of Shri Krishna.

00:35:30.655 --> 00:35:36.462
Unless and until that thing happens, this
America is the most difficult place.

00:35:36.663 --> 00:35:41.012
Sometimes I feel it's not Gokul but
Mathura.

00:35:42.952 --> 00:35:47.453
So it is for you - and otherwise you cannot
enjoy.

00:35:47.654 --> 00:35:53.509
If you live with your all old clothes,
you can't enjoy.

00:35:55.281 --> 00:36:01.146
I must say this time there were so many
people and I have asked them to promise,

00:36:01.347 --> 00:36:10.667
and asked to put a bandhan on them, and I’m
sure they will try to keep My promise.

00:36:10.868 --> 00:36:15.914
I am sure. But it is you people who
disappoint them.

00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:20.698
When they see you, they are disappointed.

00:36:22.103 --> 00:36:25.678
Actually, here is the first time, Vishwa
Nirmala Dharm

00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:31.915
has been established as a religion.

00:36:34.187 --> 00:36:41.951
It is. But the rest of it is zero.

00:36:44.438 --> 00:36:51.307
So all these differences and divisiveness
has to finish

00:36:51.508 --> 00:36:57.823
and we should be one in the collective
nature of Shri Krishna.

00:37:01.666 --> 00:37:09.638
First, meditation is very important.
Introspection is very important.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.525
And also, meeting each other, talking
to each other,

00:37:16.726 --> 00:37:20.221
knowing each other is very important.

00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:28.545
It has worked all over. It’s worked out
in India tremendously,

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:35.605
Russia tremendously, Bulgaria tremendously,
so why not here?

00:37:36.431 --> 00:37:41.617
It's no fashion for brainless people.

00:37:43.392 --> 00:37:51.921
It is a living process which has to take
place where you must mature.

00:37:52.122 --> 00:37:57.244
And what I find that Americans are
not matured.

00:37:57.975 --> 00:38:04.576
But you are now mature. You are now
mature people.

00:38:04.777 --> 00:38:10.704
And I hope you will all behave like mature
people henceforth.

00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:14.984
So may God bless you!
