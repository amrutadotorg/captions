00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.752
I’m very happy to see all of you here

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:09.154
and that now we have so many Sahaja Yogis
in Australia.

00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:22.898
I think, Australia has got the second
position in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.032
Of course, the first position if you
exclude... in the sense that

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:05.758
if you exclude Russia and the Eastern
bloc, then I would say

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:11.940
maximum number of Sahaja Yogis we have
now in Austria

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:16.048
and the second is in Australia.

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.951
Today I was late because a phone had -

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.034
phone call had come from Austria and they
were trying to talk to Me

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:30.040
and I was just wondering how it’s such
a coincidence.

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:37.056
Now, we have started in a very bumpy way,
I should say

00:01:37.257 --> 00:01:40.819
to begin with Australian Sahaja Yoga -
we had funny leaders

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.062
and lots of problems were there. But somehow
or other, now we are settling down

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:50.783
and we have a very nice group here and
that people

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:54.505
understand the value of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:54.706 --> 00:02:02.786
One thing about Australia is that it’s a
very far off place, a very exclusive place

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:07.982
and it was surprising to Me that how
Sahaja Yoga prospered here

00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:11.696
so fast and so easily.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:22.019
Perhaps maybe one of the reasons that
you are little far away,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.944
sometimes I don’t know something that
I should know,

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:30.629
and I know something I need not know.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.715
So the Australians always write very,
very long letters

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.663
so long that I cannot really read the whole
of it.

00:02:39.864 --> 00:02:44.407
As you know, your Mother has, is very,
very busy, so-called

00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:51.280
and since morning I start reading,
it doesn’t finish till the lunch time.

00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:56.044
So one thing I have to tell you, that
whatever you have to say,

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:59.516
you should say in short.

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:03.204
Even then you make it long or short, I can
understand it,

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:07.065
what’s the problem is, even with vibrations
I can.

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:11.826
Moreover, most of them are concerning
themselves,

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:15.101
all the time concerning themselves like
“I’m sick,

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:19.884
my daughter is like this, my father is like
this, brother is like this”.

00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:26.509
All regarding themselves. Very exclusive
again.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.601
Now, I would like to know more about
what you think

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:35.754
of doing Sahaja Yoga, how you would like
to go, how you would like to proceed,

00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:41.061
what is the best way of doing it. In that
case also sometimes I find

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:45.472
people mostly write about what schemes
they are have to make money,

00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:48.991
how they want to involve Sahaja Yogis
into that money-making propositions,

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:57.753
this that. So I’m surprised that Sahaja Yoga
is very different thing

00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:03.215
and one has to realize that we don’t have
to make money out of Sahaja Yogis

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:08.539
or their collectivity or anything.
Of course, you need money very well,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.157
but it should be done on a collective basis
and not on an individual basis.

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:18.368
So we are trying to plan out something for
you. Maybe work, may work out later on,

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.840
that you might be able to sell some things
here

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.348
and make some money or if you need some.

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:27.096
But actually in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve found,
we don’t need much money.

00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:32.022
If all of you, who are so many - they said
there are thousand Sahaja Yogis

00:04:32.223 --> 00:04:38.185
in Australia. Thousand is a very big
number. With a thousand Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:38.387 --> 00:04:42.638
I was discussing that why do you have
problem of money.

00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:48.525
You should not have any problem of money.
So maximum how much do you spend?

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:52.815
They said, “Maximum we spend twenty-five
thousand for the tour

00:04:53.016 --> 00:05:00.942
and all organizing” and all together - they
said - we spend about sixty thousand.”

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:07.460
It’s very simple. I said, “Everybody,
if they pay six dollars

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:15.534
per year, you can work it out.” Sixty
dollars, I’m sorry, per year.

00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:20.248
It's not much, it’s about five dollars
per month.

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.206
And I said, ‘Is it too much, five dollars?’
I mean,

00:05:23.414 --> 00:05:27.096
I’ve seen here the flowers cost you so.

00:05:27.297 --> 00:05:30.809
So on this point, they said some are very
generous,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.269
but some do not pay a single pai. This is
going too far.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:43.291
You see, also it’s a Lakshmi Principle,
must understand.

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:48.701
If you try to save such a little amount
as that,

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:54.645
how can you expect Shri Lakshmi Principle
to work out in you.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:58.354
You see, you must know what a unique thing
is Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:02.526
how it has redeemed you, how you have
transformed you

00:06:02.727 --> 00:06:08.785
and you have landed into such a beautiful
area of God’s kingdom.

00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:15.743
Now this money is not for something that
we use, say, for absurd things,

00:06:15.944 --> 00:06:18.332
but is for propagation.

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:24.247
I come here nowaday, now I’ve decided
to come every second year,

00:06:24.448 --> 00:06:29.454
so even this is too much for you to arrange
My tour,

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:36.799
then I will give up, if you think it is
too much.

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.270
Some of the people are like that, very
miserly; and there’s a reputation

00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:45.220
I don’t know why about Australians they’re
a very miserly people.

00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:47.399
They’re not. On the whole they are not.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.905
On the whole, some of them are extremely
generous and some of them are very miserly;

00:06:54.106 --> 00:07:00.371
who somehow or other confront other people
and a very bad reputation is established.

00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:04.459
So all of you have to be little generous,
otherwise you,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.118
others who are generous suffer
the consequence.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:14.139
As a Mother, I have to tell you that you
have to be generous.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.708
You know, in the beginning I was paying
all the money for everything,

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:22.403
because My husband also realized that
he should really contribute

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:26.327
to this noble work so that he is blessed.

00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:30.498
And this is where I think Australians are
failing compared to all others

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:36.049
though they are very many in number.
Now count your blessings.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.005
First count your blessings and try
to understand

00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:43.890
that what you are doing is no good
for Sahaja Yoga in Australia.

00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:51.521
Those who don’t pay at all are really
people who have not understood Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:56.763
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, I don’t need
any money, I don’t want any money.

00:07:56.964 --> 00:08:04.033
And also somebody told Me that the money
was misplaced in Australia

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.306
before, that’s why people are afraid.
That’s no reason.

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:11.008
You know that now we are handling the money
ourselves. There’s nothing like that

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:16.549
and we’ve done a lot of work since I have
taken over.

00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:21.752
So one has to understand that this is
a very low-level behavior

00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:28.284
towards Sahaja Yoga; because Sahaja Yoga
has given you so much, so much,

00:08:28.485 --> 00:08:31.821
and you just count what Sahaja Yoga
has given you,

00:08:32.022 --> 00:08:34.506
then it looks very low-level

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:39.551
that you can’t even contribute six pounds
or five pounds,

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:43.793
or five dollars, I’m sorry five dollars,
that too Australia.

00:08:43.994 --> 00:08:47.557
For your recession, who is responsible?

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.198
How will you progress?

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:57.935
This is a very delicate subject. I didn’t
want to talk about it,

00:08:58.136 --> 00:09:01.107
but if Australians are known to be like
that,

00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:05.213
I think it’s better to have a proper image.

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:10.805
Actually the main, heavy things that are
paid

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:14.652
like building ashrams, building schools and
all that

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.123
do not come from your money at all, not
a single pai,

00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:22.172
from your money nothing comes out. It comes
out of International Funds,

00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:27.469
out of people who are extremely generous
and also partly from Me

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:34.506
and if some money is left over
with the tour.

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:41.430
So this one I had to talk to you today.
Saturday is all right, not on Easter Day

00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:45.164
I wouldn’t talk all these things, but today
is the day when you should know

00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:50.685
that Christ was suffering, and this is
the time we have to understand

00:09:50.886 --> 00:09:55.863
that you are not in the suffering any more,
you have come out.

00:09:55.993 --> 00:09:59.831
But the way you treat Sahaja Yoga is just
a side issue,

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:03.206
like buying a magazine sort of a thing.
It’s not good.

00:10:03.407 --> 00:10:06.399
You are not paying due respect to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.423
It’s of course your dedication is important,
meditation is much more important,

00:10:12.624 --> 00:10:15.450
but little money you must keep for Sahaja
Yoga.

00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:18.351
There is no need for you to pay

00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:22.702
like the way you pay for these gurus and
all that, nothing of the kind.

00:10:22.903 --> 00:10:29.581
But a little money you should learn to take
it out with respect, with dedication

00:10:29.782 --> 00:10:35.294
because after all we have to pay in some
places.

00:10:35.514 --> 00:10:38.762
I should not talk about these things, and
I have told Steven

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.272
to circulate a letter of requesting them,
telling them what’s the problem is.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:51.670
It is a, I mean in India, they are anxious
to pay for Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:55.159
and in every country I’ve seen they are
anxious to pay.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:06.528
So this kind of an atmosphere and this kind
of a beautiful gathering that we have,

00:11:06.748 --> 00:11:10.312
we should also think what we can do
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:10.513 --> 00:11:16.041
The second thing you have to do that as you
have got your Realization,

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:20.673
others also should get it. So you have
to form groups,

00:11:20.874 --> 00:11:26.760
go round the cities, go round to the smaller
places and try to spread it.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.811
Some people do it. Definitely, some people
do it,

00:11:31.012 --> 00:11:35.011
but there are thousand Sahaja Yogis,
if they do it every year

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.736
they can increase and multiply like
anything.

00:11:39.937 --> 00:11:44.320
If you can really always think that we have
to do something for Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:48.810
you can go out on Saturdays, Sundays, form
your music groups

00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:57.201
or anything and try to establish Sahaja
Yoga outside.

00:11:57.411 --> 00:12:03.463
You are duty-bound to do it. Like when
this light was not there, it was all right,

00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:06.238
but when it has got the light, it has
to give the light,

00:12:06.439 --> 00:12:09.654
that is the duty of the light, it’s
the nature of the light.

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:15.223
That’s what you have to do, is to spread
Sahaja Yoga as much as possible.

00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:21.024
The third thing I feel, that I should point
it out,

00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:24.821
that when it came to going to America
nobody wrote to Me.

00:12:25.022 --> 00:12:29.242
Nobody told Me that people are going
to America.

00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:34.937
It’s very wrong, because in America Sahaja
Yoga is not at all established.

00:12:35.138 --> 00:12:40.005
There are very few Sahaja Yogis. Secondly,
you just went there for a holiday

00:12:40.206 --> 00:12:42.468
or some sort of a thing I don’t know what.

00:12:42.669 --> 00:12:47.955
I have already told you that America is
hell. Why do you want to go to America?

00:12:48.594 --> 00:12:51.751
There are other places you could have gone.
You could have worked there,

00:12:51.952 --> 00:12:56.239
but you put pressure on those people who
were there. Not only that, but you caught

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.497
all kinds of funny things from that
horrible land of America.

00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:07.967
Americans as you know are very, very
immature.

00:13:08.237 --> 00:13:10.761
They don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.
All kinds of gurus are there.

00:13:10.962 --> 00:13:14.760
There are witchcraft, legally accepted
things like that.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.396
Of all the places why should you go
to America, I can’t understand.

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:22.036
And people just went there to America, was
a very wrong thing to do -

00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:27.190
without even telling Me, without even
informing Me, they went there,

00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:30.393
otherwise I would have stopped it.

00:13:33.476 --> 00:13:36.527
The another difficulty came up for Me
very much,

00:13:36.728 --> 00:13:40.784
that because you had not decided to go
for a India tour,

00:13:40.985 --> 00:13:45.139
this is the last time we’ll have such
a tour which was so expensive.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.477
But it was all thought that all Sahaja
Yogis

00:13:48.678 --> 00:13:51.932
will enjoy in the same amount that you have
been paying.

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:59.071
We started this idea, everybody knew
about it, but at the last moment

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:05.917
when I went to England, to find out there
was no money at all.

00:14:06.017 --> 00:14:10.001
So I had to borrow money and do
the business.

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:13.864
This is very, very troublesome and you
don’t want your Mother to be troubled

00:14:14.065 --> 00:14:18.392
for nothing at all. And then suddenly
so many came.

00:14:18.593 --> 00:14:23.755
You see, how you understand that supposing
you have to take this place,

00:14:23.956 --> 00:14:27.734
you cannot just last moment come and say,
‘Oh no, we want to take this place.’

00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:34.227
You have to organize all your travel
by train, by buses, by this, by that.

00:14:34.428 --> 00:14:38.857
How much Indians work. They organize
everything throughout.

00:14:39.058 --> 00:14:45.817
This time they really got absolutely upset
because some people just came to Delhi,

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:55.983
some people came through the Hariyana tour,
some went to another part.

00:14:56.113 --> 00:15:00.738
But the worst is some of them just came
after Poona.

00:15:00.939 --> 00:15:04.416
They said, ‘We’ll do half.’ You better
not come.

00:15:04.617 --> 00:15:08.246
If you have no money, you need not come.
‘Mother, give us half,’

00:15:08.447 --> 00:15:13.036
then one-fourth, then one-fifth. I mean,
there’s no bargain about it.

00:15:13.237 --> 00:15:16.620
The money that you give is for the full
tour

00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:22.138
because we have to organize it on that
premises.

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:24.483
For example, you go anywhere now.

00:15:24.684 --> 00:15:27.230
There’s a, they’ll say, ‘Now, there is
a train available

00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:31.018
if you have five hundred passengers.’
So we take the whole train.

00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:34.991
All right, now you only, say, three hundred
people pay,

00:15:35.192 --> 00:15:38.989
then all the two hundred who is going
to pay?

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:46.004
It is something you are away from the rest
of the world, sitting down here,

00:15:46.205 --> 00:15:50.977
enjoying Sahaja Yoga. You don’t understand
that all these things have caused

00:15:51.178 --> 00:15:57.776
lot of problems and a deficit, big deficit.

00:15:58.036 --> 00:16:03.453
I don’t know what has happened, I’m now
going back to Cabella to sit down

00:16:03.654 --> 00:16:09.199
and find out about the accounts, which
I am very bad at it.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.209
And the more you only care for such things,
the worse it will be.

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:19.712
I have to tell you that it’s - there’s no
planning needed as such,

00:16:19.913 --> 00:16:26.665
but anywhere in modern times, if you have
to go, you have to do it beforehand.

00:16:26.866 --> 00:16:30.238
It’s not just you reach there and say:
“All right, Mother, we are here now”.

00:16:30.439 --> 00:16:39.307
Do what you like. All these things have
really upset

00:16:39.387 --> 00:16:45.781
the Sahaja Yogis in New Delhi and
in Bombay. And they have sent Me word

00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:49.980
that ‘Mother, please tell all the Sahaja
Yogis all over the world,

00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:53.777
specially, specially Australians

00:16:53.978 --> 00:17:00.045
that they should take a decision before
at least a month.’

00:17:00.246 --> 00:17:06.051
So if you could decide in October it would
be better.

00:17:06.252 --> 00:17:10.332
And send over the money because if you
borrow the money from the bank,

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:14.018
you know you have to pay interest also.

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:21.569
So, I know children sometimes don’t behave
properly,

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:26.575
but you don’t want Me to have trouble
of this kind

00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:31.564
and a Mother has to tell the children what
are her problems are.

00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:36.697
On the whole, there are some Sahaja Yogis
in Australia who are tremendous.

00:17:36.898 --> 00:17:42.878
They are doing so well. They send such
beautiful cards to Me.

00:17:43.068 --> 00:17:49.673
They write such beautiful poems that really
I don’t know how to thank them.

00:17:49.884 --> 00:17:56.040
But first of all, you have a duty to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:56.241 --> 00:18:00.173
Secondly, it is for you to enjoy Sahaja
Yoga,

00:18:00.374 --> 00:18:03.914
but also to see that by your behavior

00:18:04.115 --> 00:18:08.920
you don’t trouble other Sahaja Yogis
all over the world.

00:18:10.181 --> 00:18:16.941
Sahaja Yoga has so much progressed here.
It’s a very, very surprising thing.

00:18:17.091 --> 00:18:20.671
We had a very bumpy start, I told you.
I used to think that

00:18:20.872 --> 00:18:25.184
Sahaja Yoga in Australia will be
disappearing into Indian Sea or something,

00:18:25.385 --> 00:18:30.144
but we have now people who understand
what is Sahaja Yoga

00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:35.165
and also you have very, very good leaders
practically everywhere.

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:42.687
Also they understand Sahaja Yoga very well
and they think it’s a very important thing

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:47.201
and try to think how important is Sahaja
Yoga.

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:50.981
With all those things, you see,

00:18:51.182 --> 00:18:57.492
a very, very simple understanding should
be there

00:18:57.642 --> 00:19:02.594
that we belong to one family. When I come
here I feel a joy

00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:06.870
of a Mother who has come to meet all
Her children, Her family

00:19:07.071 --> 00:19:10.747
and, if we are in a family, we bear
a responsibility.

00:19:10.948 --> 00:19:15.958
I don’t want to put any pressure on you,
on money, which is not reasonable.

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:22.140
But you should be also reasonable about it
and try to think

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:27.417
in a serious manner that whatever Mother
is doing, whatever She’s trying,

00:19:27.618 --> 00:19:33.157
we should not put a burden on Her. So
for one thing I must congratulate you

00:19:33.358 --> 00:19:37.253
that all the collectivity has come back
to normal. Even in Melbourne

00:19:37.454 --> 00:19:43.885
I was surprised how the collectivity has
come back and is helping everyone.

00:19:44.094 --> 00:19:50.029
Leaders, all of Australia I talked to them
one by one

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.088
and they only say that “They are all right,
for Pujas, they are very good.

00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:58.911
They are good for other collective things
we do.

00:19:59.112 --> 00:20:09.196
But as far as working for Sahaja Yoga,
you’ll get handful of...

00:20:09.396 --> 00:20:13.843
When it comes to working for Sahaja Yoga,
very few will be available.

00:20:14.862 --> 00:20:20.476
All the way on the road, they had built
about twenty-five to thirty big gates for Me

00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:26.627
on the way, and also had advertised
all over, all over Poona.

00:20:26.828 --> 00:20:33.552
And I was amazed we had a hundred thousand
people for the program.

00:20:33.753 --> 00:20:36.524
Can you believe it?

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:42.912
And then second time, when I went
to Bombay, I was surprised really.

00:20:43.113 --> 00:20:47.637
We have a park called Shivaji Park and
there always had been big meetings

00:20:47.838 --> 00:20:53.657
of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru,
this, that.

00:20:53.907 --> 00:20:59.292
And I was amazed that they all said, ‘There
has been never such a big number

00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:03.003
of at least 125,000 people.’

00:21:03.204 --> 00:21:06.514
All done by the people, everybody working
out,

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:10.042
anybody who knew this one, he brought this,
he brought that

00:21:10.243 --> 00:21:13.967
and, by doing that, you see the expenses
were much less

00:21:14.168 --> 00:21:16.653
and they never put a pressure on Me
for money.

00:21:16.854 --> 00:21:20.355
Never. I have never seen these people.
They are not so rich as you are.

00:21:20.556 --> 00:21:27.168
You are very rich people. But they have
never put any pressure on Me.

00:21:27.478 --> 00:21:31.594
To them Sahaja Yoga is their life, Sahaja
Yoga is their aim

00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:36.154
and Sahaja Yoga is totality.

00:21:36.355 --> 00:21:42.017
So with all this, I have to tell you that
your… I’ve told the leaders

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:45.493
to make a list of people who do not pay
money,

00:21:45.694 --> 00:21:49.683
also to make a list of people who do not
help in the work;

00:21:49.884 --> 00:21:55.548
not the ones who help, but those who do not
help, so I’ll put a bandhan on them

00:21:55.678 --> 00:22:00.754
and let them feel that it is important what
we have to do.

00:22:00.962 --> 00:22:05.472
Last but not the least, the problem
of certain marriages

00:22:05.673 --> 00:22:11.206
which crop up very much here, I am
surprised.

00:22:11.407 --> 00:22:15.476
Men, you are to be married, you are given
full chance to decide

00:22:15.677 --> 00:22:20.782
whom do you want to marry. And after
marriage

00:22:22.496 --> 00:22:30.555
it goes off. Mostly it is the mistake
of the women here, I’m very surprised,

00:22:30.685 --> 00:22:32.995
because always it’s the woman who
dominates,

00:22:33.196 --> 00:22:35.928
see she wants this, she wants that,
like that.

00:22:36.129 --> 00:22:40.847
Now, you have to know that women are very
important for society.

00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:45.391
Your problem is not so much of political
problems or economic problems, as such.

00:22:45.592 --> 00:22:50.441
It is always common like that in every
Western country.

00:22:50.571 --> 00:22:54.564
But the main problem you are facing is
your society.

00:22:54.765 --> 00:22:58.092
You know what’s happening in your society,
what a terrible society it is,

00:22:58.293 --> 00:23:02.463
how the children are harmed, how the women
are tortured,

00:23:02.664 --> 00:23:05.221
how so many things are happening
in our society

00:23:05.422 --> 00:23:08.976
and all kinds of filthy things are
happening

00:23:09.177 --> 00:23:14.108
which cannot be called as anywhere near
advancement.

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:19.677
All these things we see around us and we
see our children suffer with that.

00:23:19.878 --> 00:23:25.708
So what - who is responsible
for the society? Women.

00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:32.710
Women are responsible for the society.
They have to do it.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:39.393
I’m also a woman and I understand that
to Me society is so important.

00:23:39.594 --> 00:23:42.951
I should not Myself do something that is
wrong.

00:23:43.152 --> 00:23:46.527
I should not allow My children to do
something wrong.

00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:50.047
Now, if children are

00:23:51.842 --> 00:23:54.830
not meditating, they are not footsoaking -

00:23:55.031 --> 00:24:01.081
I was told that nobody can corrected
anybody else’s child.

00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:05.787
If somebody says something to somebody’s
child, they’ll be angry.

00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:09.418
Even Indian ladies, I was surprised,
don’t like

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:13.907
anybody correcting their child. It’s not
in India. Never.

00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:16.888
If one woman does that, she’ll be discarded
from the society.

00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:21.846
Anybody can correct you and parents thank
that person.

00:24:22.047 --> 00:24:26.478
Say, when we were young,

00:24:26.679 --> 00:24:30.998
supposing on the road we are laughing,
say that could be a joke, we are walking.

00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:34.368
And somebody informed My mother, she would
shout at us,

00:24:34.569 --> 00:24:39.800
‘What business you had to make jokes
on the street and laugh like that?

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:45.811
It’s very cheapish.’ But she would never
shout at the person who reported.

00:24:46.012 --> 00:24:50.273
That was not done. So this is another thing
I want to tell you very frankly,

00:24:50.482 --> 00:24:54.373
that no parents should feel bad if somebody
corrects the child.

00:24:54.574 --> 00:24:57.407
Should thank that person because
your children need

00:24:57.608 --> 00:25:00.150
too much of correction, you have no idea.

00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:01.851
When we started the school,

00:25:02.052 --> 00:25:06.852
just after two month they gave up, said
‘These are not children.

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:11.649
These are coming from some jungles and they
bite us, and they hit us,

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:19.546
and they take out all our belongings and
throw them.’

00:25:19.747 --> 00:25:23.135
They were so horrible hooligans.

00:25:23.336 --> 00:25:28.895
For two months they tried and they gave up.
They said, “Close this school.

00:25:29.075 --> 00:25:32.091
We can’t have. We’ll have Indian children.”

00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:36.042
I told them - I gave them one ebony rod,
so big as that, black.

00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.758
Said, ‘You show them this. Say that this
Mother has given.

00:25:38.959 --> 00:25:43.034
Anybody who tries to misbehave, we’ll touch
that person with this”.

00:25:43.235 --> 00:25:45.925
And they were all right.

00:25:46.568 --> 00:25:50.195
They started behaving all right. Otherwise
this school would not have been there.

00:25:50.396 --> 00:25:53.094
You don’t know how terrible they were.
They were used,

00:25:53.295 --> 00:25:55.358
they used to threaten that ‘We’ll jump
down the cliff’

00:25:55.559 --> 00:26:02.330
or they used to climb over the trees or
on top of the roof also, like monkeys.

00:26:02.531 --> 00:26:07.910
Just like monkeys, without any discipline,
without anything.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.251
So your children need much more correction
than anybody else.

00:26:11.452 --> 00:26:15.079
Not only Australia, I mean any on
of the foreigners, they need.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.410
So it’s better that you allow others
to correct your children.

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:23.755
And I’m surprised that Indian ladies
objecting to it.

00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:30.038
They are also learning bad things from here
I think. This is never in India.

00:26:30.208 --> 00:26:34.043
Nobody does that and that’s why Indian
children are much better.

00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:38.325
You will not - you have, you must have
noticed Indian children in a group there,

00:26:38.526 --> 00:26:40.956
how they behave, how quiet they are, how

00:26:41.157 --> 00:26:45.300
how sweetly they are listening
to everything. Very nice.

00:26:45.501 --> 00:26:48.225
The reason is they are disciplined not only
by parents,

00:26:48.426 --> 00:26:55.682
but by the whole society. And the idea is
that everybody loves your children.

00:26:55.812 --> 00:26:58.899
They are the children of the whole society.
We live collectively.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.528
We are not individualistic. And if they
find anything wrong with the child,

00:27:02.729 --> 00:27:06.381
they should correct. Of course if you find
somebody who is doing it just

00:27:06.582 --> 00:27:12.710
to show their anger or temper, then you can
report to the leader,

00:27:12.911 --> 00:27:14.955
but normally it should be treated…

00:27:15.156 --> 00:27:20.986
After all, you are all parents and you know
what is good for children.

00:27:21.236 --> 00:27:27.925
I was amazed that children are not allowed
at all to be corrected by anybody else

00:27:28.126 --> 00:27:33.252
because, you see, a child, you must know,
is a big responsibility

00:27:33.453 --> 00:27:37.148
and only the mother cannot control, only
the father cannot control.

00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:41.744
The whole society has to control and
discipline the child.

00:27:41.964 --> 00:27:46.837
So the idea of good mannerism - this is not
good manners. These are not good manners.

00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:48.981
You see, we should know, these are not
good manners.

00:27:49.182 --> 00:27:50.723
One should feel very shy about it.

00:27:50.924 --> 00:27:54.895
I remember once my grand-daughter we had
taken her to Brighton

00:27:55.096 --> 00:28:03.977
and she wanted to go on a ride on a - they
have what small, small trains.

00:28:04.178 --> 00:28:08.426
So they went round and came back. Still
she wanted to do it again

00:28:08.627 --> 00:28:14.777
and I said, “No, no, you can’t do it.
We have to go now.”

00:28:14.897 --> 00:28:17.487
Then she looked at her mother and started
crying.

00:28:17.623 --> 00:28:21.582
Mother said, ‘Whether you cry or anything,
you are not to go again. That’s what it is.’

00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:25.931
She must have cried for about, say, five
minutes and then she felt so ashamed

00:28:26.132 --> 00:28:30.419
she put both the hands on her face. So she
was very young,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.852
so must be about four years. I said,
“Why are you hiding your face?”

00:28:35.053 --> 00:28:38.412
‘Because I misbehaved.’

00:28:39.673 --> 00:28:42.431
These are not good manners. From very
childhood, you must tell

00:28:42.632 --> 00:28:48.588
your children what are bad manners and
what is their position.

00:28:48.808 --> 00:28:54.988
They are Sahaja Yogis. Put them up.
Tell them what is their dignity,

00:28:55.189 --> 00:28:59.961
how they are, they - how special they are,
how much God’s work they are going to do,

00:29:00.162 --> 00:29:02.782
they are in the kingdom of God, they can’t
behave like this.

00:29:02.983 --> 00:29:07.716
Anybody who tells you should not mind
because it’s all for their good.

00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:10.624
It doesn’t, in no way harm your child,

00:29:10.825 --> 00:29:15.772
but this shows your, what you call, mamat
where you say that you are attached,

00:29:15.973 --> 00:29:17.679
“It’s my child. That’s his child. That’s
his child.”

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.772
Nothing like that. In Sahaja Yoga every
child belongs to everyone

00:29:23.973 --> 00:29:26.824
and that is what we have to show
in our life.

00:29:27.025 --> 00:29:30.554
Even our things in the West I have seen,

00:29:30.624 --> 00:29:34.439
people if they think belongs to somebody
else, they’ll just spoil it.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.118
If it is theirs, then they’ll keep it very
carefully, not to be touched.

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:44.429
That’s not Sahaj culture. Sahaj culture,
I’ll tell you what, like supposing

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.396
if there’s a spoon from somebody’s family
has come in the house,

00:29:48.597 --> 00:29:52.606
everybody will be telling us, ‘Is it there
or not? Have you returned it (or) not?’

00:29:52.807 --> 00:29:55.196
Even a spoon, they’ll eat us off.

00:29:55.397 --> 00:30:00.231
I tell you this not only with Me but any
Indian family.

00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:03.902
Not that all Indian culture is all right,
but quite a lot is needed

00:30:04.103 --> 00:30:07.826
to compensate for this kind of a culture
where everybody is free,

00:30:08.027 --> 00:30:11.972
do what you like, live as you like.

00:30:12.173 --> 00:30:15.367
So also you have to train them up, how they
should live,

00:30:15.568 --> 00:30:19.153
how they should keep their things.
For example, in Cabella we had

00:30:19.354 --> 00:30:25.744
children and we had parents and they were
putting them in their own rooms.

00:30:25.974 --> 00:30:28.602
I said, “No, there’s no need you to -
there’s so many rooms.

00:30:28.803 --> 00:30:31.961
We make one room for the children.
And let them feel

00:30:32.162 --> 00:30:35.590
that this is their room, they have to look
after it.” I was so surprised.

00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:39.843
The same children who were spoiling
their parents’ rooms all the time

00:30:40.044 --> 00:30:43.506
started with their little, little hands
carrying their blankets, little blankets

00:30:43.707 --> 00:30:47.527
and everything and putting it up nicely,
keeping it clean

00:30:47.728 --> 00:30:51.127
and “Mother is going to come”, so they
put up some flowers.

00:30:51.328 --> 00:30:56.408
I said “So sweet”. I said, “The same
children about whom parents were saying,

00:30:56.618 --> 00:30:59.499
‘Mother, they’re hopeless. Every day
we have to spend so much time

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.170
on their thing, they put this thing here
and put there’.”

00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:06.358
So to make them responsible. And so sweetly
they did it.

00:31:06.518 --> 00:31:10.586
They are all below five years, from two
years to five years, imagine.

00:31:10.787 --> 00:31:14.360
So sweetly they did it and for Me also they
made a seat

00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:16.911
and wouldn’t allow the adults to do
anything.

00:31:17.112 --> 00:31:19.779
So I was surprised, the same children
how they have changed.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.918
Only by getting a dignified place
for themselves

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:26.303
and an understanding that they have to do
something.

00:31:26.504 --> 00:31:30.139
So too much of protectiveness is not
needed,

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.658
and abandonment is also not. You have to be
in the centre,

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:38.355
tell your children how to behave and what
is the good manners are.

00:31:38.556 --> 00:31:42.207
They should know, “These are bad manners.
We just can’t do it

00:31:42.408 --> 00:31:48.537
We just can’t do it. Bad manners.” And
this, if you tell, they will understand,

00:31:48.647 --> 00:31:51.969
because we must face our children. We have
to tell them.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.090
Whatever is wrong we have to tell them.

00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:57.174
I’m sorry today I took too much time and
I hope

00:31:57.375 --> 00:32:03.751
your leader will forgive Me for this…
because…

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:15.120
I’m just trying to use this time
for something really very much needed.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.795
I never get a chance to talk to Sahaja
Yogis in this way.

00:32:18.996 --> 00:32:21.230
When it’s a Puja time, it’s so auspicious

00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:27.583
that you don’t want to say anything that
will make people little unhappy.

00:32:27.784 --> 00:32:36.036
So I have a feeling of a Mother who loves
Her children very much

00:32:36.237 --> 00:32:45.567
and who wants Her children to enjoy life
fully in the Kingdom of God.

00:32:45.627 --> 00:32:48.145
So I hope you don’t mind whatever I have
said

00:32:48.346 --> 00:32:52.060
and whatever I have done is all for
our good.

00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:55.175
May God bless you.

00:33:18.012 --> 00:33:22.571
There’s some more time can you give Me –
the leaders?

00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:35.553
This is the first time I saw everything
so organized

00:33:35.754 --> 00:33:40.143
according to time and this is the first
time I’ve let you down.

00:33:43.463 --> 00:33:49.263
It’s a - you know because of your customs,

00:33:49.343 --> 00:33:51.751
you know what is the situation is, you
can’t bring too many things

00:33:51.952 --> 00:33:55.527
but whatever I could I’ve got it
for the leaders and all that,

00:33:55.728 --> 00:34:01.604
so I’ll just now read the names and then
you can collect it from Vinay.

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:09.050
This is for all the leaders here:

00:34:10.377 --> 00:34:19.695
Mr Steven and then John, then Michael, Ben,
Hugh -

00:34:19.896 --> 00:34:29.166
what’s the name? Albert. - Albert, then
John Henshaw, and who? Robin, Robin Reed.

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:37.187
Then also for ladies, according
to the leadership, leaders’ wives is:

00:34:41.026 --> 00:34:53.420
Marylin? Marylin, and we have Sue, Jo,
Savita – Brisbane, who is from Brisbane?

00:34:53.654 --> 00:35:05.654
Albert’s wife – and Jennie, and Gulsha (?)
what’s kind of a name?”

00:35:09.135 --> 00:35:13.638
So this is, these are the names
of the people who are leaders,

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:18.150
Savita because she really worked very hard
for Me.

00:35:18.351 --> 00:35:22.338
So that’s how we have presents for them,
very small presents,

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:28.409
I hope you all can take it from Vinay.
I have already touched them, blessed them,

00:35:28.509 --> 00:35:33.487
so it’s alright, we can save some time.

00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:58.722
Also they wanted Me to bring some sarees…
(Yogi says in Hindi, “Sold it”).

00:35:58.922 --> 00:36:03.265
Sold it! (Yogi: Yes) I hoped you liked
them.
