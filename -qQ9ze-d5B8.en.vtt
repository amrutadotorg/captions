00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.960
so

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
once you are left shruti is absolutely

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.439
jammed

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.800
you lose complete discretion

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.920
of the chakra here

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.519
which we call it hamsa

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.920
and then you do not know what is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.680
distracted what is constructive

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120
you start accepting mostly the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.239
destructive thing

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.239
if you are left with this man escape

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.280
so what what wrong

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.280
that is how violence has come

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.520
that is how all kind of cheating

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.120
corruption

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.120
has come what's wrong because if you do

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.520
anything wrong we put it there finished

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.800
stored up again you do anything you put

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.920
it there and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:12.320
till you become absolutely immune to all

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:15.759
destructive action you go on

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.280
so to get out of it what to do

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.240
to get out of this horrible state where

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.360
you do not feel

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.400
any uh

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.759
thing wrong

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.600
what is the thing is only is to take to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.960
sahaja yoga

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.560
in a right fashion first of all

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.079
you must face yourself if you start

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.600
facing yourself

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.240
you will realize that you have committed

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.240
a mistake

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.159
so this is the mistake i have committed

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.240
doesn't matter

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.079
i am not going to feel guilty about it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.799
if i ever have to do this

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.560
i will not do it and i am not guilty for

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.960
whatever has happened is the past

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.960
finished

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.200
with this faith in yourself

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.280
you can definitely get rid of your

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.959
leftish

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.720
the problem is even if i tell you

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.920
something i'm

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.440
worried that you start feeling guilty

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.360
about it also

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.480
i mean i'm telling you for something for

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.520
your correction

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.360
then you start to guilty ah mother is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.040
saying so she i did this and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.800
but that you did at this moment

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
what i'm telling you never to do it

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.560
again

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.920
and face it whatever he did is finished

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.760
and gone and is forgiven completely

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.760
otherwise vishnu maya will take over

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.440
this is very important because

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.120
one side is a leela

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.560
it's a play and it's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.280
all the world is beautiful the another

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.720
side

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.519
is the guilt

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.840
so we think that by just feeling guilty

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.840
we are solving all our problems

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.080
and this side we are enjoying ourselves

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.280
and this the guilt part is just like a

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.879
storehouse of a garbage

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.120
big buddha but we never think this

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.640
garbage what it is wrong it is doing to

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.599
us

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.000
and this is what it is that vishnu maya

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.200
has to burn this garbage

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.519
then she works in her

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.200
own ways in her own maya ways and so

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.959
many things happen

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.560
like there was a lady and she was very

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.560
right-sided

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.000
she used to dominate everyone but nobody

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.280
dared tell her that because if

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.879
you tell her she would come back on you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.799
so nobody wanted to tell her what's

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.400
wrong with her they said all right let

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.560
it be now

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.400
but i told her that see you are very

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.480
right sided you are dominating everyone

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.599
everybody is frightened of it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.959
so she said no mother i am not

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.080
i am telling you you better believe me

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.760
or

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.920
you are in for trouble and that very day

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.840
she was getting down from the staircase

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.799
and she fell from top to bottom she came

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.199
down

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.239
and on her right side she came to

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.360
madarashi

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.560
my right hand is broken my right leg is

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.479
broken

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.600
this is broken that is broken

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.000
i said then you know what happened i now

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.040
know

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.040
why it has happened then i cured her

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.960
she was all right but what i am trying

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.720
to tell you that she wouldn't listen to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.160
me

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.960
so the right sided people have a special

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.520
capacity to put everything here

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:56.240
so i always say that it is the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:00.560
byproduct of ego

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:05.199
those people who try to dominate who try

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.880
to be angry try to control everyone

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:13.039
they put it down there and

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.039
then the whole thing works against them

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.479
this is to be understood in a very

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.919
serious manner

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.919
that feeling guilty is not that you are

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.240
harming yourself but you are harming all

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.240
others

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.840
also this vishnu maya gets very upset

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.160
with two other things

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.800
one of the things is smoking

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.360
if you smoke too much then this vishnu

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.039
maya

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.479
gets very angry she

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:51.520
she is the one who then causes cancer

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:53.680
she can spoil your throat

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.240
all kinds of ear nose throat problems

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.919
can come in with the smoking

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.039
because she doesn't like that smoke

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:06.479
she once twice

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.280
tries but once you start smoking then

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.880
after some time

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.919
what's wrong they will quote such and

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.759
such man

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.680
who is 83 he still smokes

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.919
see coating like this they have ideas

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.240
like that then you have also some cinema

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.080
of

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.240
heroes such and such man see

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.759
he murdered his wife he's not you see

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.039
he's going along

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.919
so we should also murder we should also

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.319
smoke

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.880
so the all ideals which have destroyed

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.280
themselves become our ideas

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.400
and we start exactly doing what they are

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.880
doing

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.600
without knowing that how they are

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.280
destroyed

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:51.599
will be also destroyed so

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.880
this understanding

00:06:51.599 --> 00:07:00.160
about vishnu maya's powers

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:04.400
should be there with us that if we try

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.440
to continue with our mistakes

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.440
and putting them here

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:14.479
then first thing we become vulnerable

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.240
to all kinds of diseases with that if

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:20.639
you have smoke

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:23.599
smoking you can become also

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.919
very much vulnerable to cancer of the

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.919
throat

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.880
another thing which people do not know

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.160
is the mantras

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.919
if you go on saying any mantra

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.919
i mean in india there are people who

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:41.840
will every day morning get up and say

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:45.280
some mantra for about say

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.199
hundred times some say it at least 300

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.960
times 500 times

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:51.280
they go on measuring mantra mantra

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.720
mantra mantra like that

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.120
now she's the mantrika

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.479
she's the one who gives the power to the

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.840
mantra

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:04.720
now if you are not connected

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.000
to this divine power then there's a

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.440
short-circuiting

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.160
take place and if you go on saying this

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.919
mantra

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.000
you develop all the troubles of the

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:15.919
throat throat cancer

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.680
you can develop also stomach in the

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.319
stomach problems because

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.440
it is krishna and vishnu are the same

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:26.000
you might develop

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:29.039
also the problem of virata

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.560
because you are

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:36.240
reciting a mantra like this you see a

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.560
telephone if it is not connected

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.800
i go on using it the telephone will go

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.560
out of order

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.120
in the same way if you are doing wrong

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.040
mantras

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.959
in the sense that the mantras which are

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.240
said before your connection with the

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:54.959
divine

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.200
then they can spoil your leftish very

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:57.200
much

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:01.600
this is the style they use in india

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.200
supposing

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.959
you are a businessman in india

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.480
now you're a big businessman you have

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:10.000
made a lot of money now i feel guilty

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.399
about it

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.959
because you are made by bad means also

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:18.560
by all kinds of black market and all

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:23.600
sorts so they'll make a big temple

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.839
of vishnu

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.920
not vishuddhi but they'll make a very

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:31.279
big temple of sri vishnu

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.360
and and they they will create

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.560
a kind of image that we they are great

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.320
religious people

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.120
or they they'll have hierarchies they

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.120
will distribute food to people

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.360
or distribute some things to people and

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.560
feel satisfied

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:50.080
here you go on committing any amount of

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.440
sins any amount of nonsense

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.880
and then out of that money

00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.399
you make a little contribution

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.640
to sri vishnu thinking that steve vishnu

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:04.880
will be very happy and will not punish

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.760
them but he is kubera what can you give

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.440
it to him he is the kubera

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.600
he gives you all the money he does

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.279
everything so how can you

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:20.240
give anything to kubera who is

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:23.279
himself the lord of wealth

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.640
it's a very common thing in india like

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:29.040
uh there was a buddha thing i knew of a

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.760
man who was very corrupt very bad person

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.200
i mean

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.040
reidy was really very very bad man

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.360
and he had taken away so much land from

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.760
the poor farmers and all that

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:46.000
so he gave one land mahatma gandhi

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:49.120
and this land this buddha man was known

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.640
it was i think nobody gave this land

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:56.160
was so bad that you could not put

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.160
even cactus there

00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.240
and he was telling everybody i have

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:02.240
given so much land to buddha and i've

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.760
given so much land

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:09.040
so trying to sort of justify himself

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.160
for taking all the land from the poor

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:15.680
and lynching them and then to

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.079
do this kind of a generosity so this is

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.200
another escape people have

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:25.519
that do what you like and ultimately

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:29.120
be generous this kind

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:33.120
of gracious covering

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:36.480
of your mistakes can be very misleading

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.320
it doesn't work with vishnu she knows

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.040
you out and out

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.720
and if you try all these tricks with her

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.000
she will show her

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.720
own powers i would say all our

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.279
left side problems come because of

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:55.600
vishnu my power

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:59.360
she punishes you as well as she exposes

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:03.120
as well as she gives you light as well

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.120
as she corrects you

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.160
with all these powers of shravaya we

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.920
should be very thankful

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.680
that today we are celebrating

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.519
her special puja

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.440
because i think it is one of the curses

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:22.079
of the best especially of americans to

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.959
feel guilty

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.079
so today you all have to promise in your

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:28.079
heart and the mantra

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.600
is now they all she also understand

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:32.480
english perhaps

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.440
you can say that mother i am not guilty

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.639
at all

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.639
that's all if that is said she will be

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:39.920
very happy i'm not guilty at all i'm not

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.760
going to feel guilty

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.760
once you stop feeling guilty you will

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.399
not do wrong things

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.600
because how will you manage because you

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:50.079
are not doing

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.839
you cannot put it as guilt so it was

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:54.000
just doing anything wrong if you do

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:57.360
wrong it comes on your head

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.560
you cannot put it in your leftish so

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.560
you won't do anything wrong

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.600
you will immediately understand that if

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:08.000
i have to do wrong i have to face it

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.600
but if there's a space here kept where

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.880
you can put your guilt

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.680
for your wrongdoings available

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.600
then you don't mind so much supposing

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.399
somebody has a small house no place to

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.079
store

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:21.680
then somebody brings something says no

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:26.000
no space here

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.000
i am already very full it's like that

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:35.120
so the best thing is to have

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.560
no guilt at any cost i will have no

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.839
guilt if i have done mistake all right

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:42.240
i'll admit i've done the mistake

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:43.440
and i'll have no guilt at all about it

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.199
i'll face it

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.440
you'll be surprised you'll stop doing

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:49.120
wrong things

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.120
definitely you stop because there's no

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.120
space left

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.120
so this is very important today to do

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.760
vishnu maya's thing

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.000
and i'm sure now very happy

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.959
with the tour of america this time i'm

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.760
really happy

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:06.480
because i think it has worked in most of

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.800
the places

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.959
very well and if it has not worked

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.000
one should not feel guilty but face the

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:19.199
problem why it has not worked

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.040
and the problem lies with sahaja yogis

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:26.079
and nobody else shouldn't blame anybody

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.399
else for it just see

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:30.160
yourself what mistakes you must have

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:32.240
committed could be a small or a big

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.440
mistake whatever it is

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.519
face it that's no harm in saying i am

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.079
i've done mistake

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:42.160
but if you say sorry means it goes

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:45.680
that's straightforward

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:49.279
no i have committed a mistake

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:52.160
to admit that is very gracious

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:54.000
very beautiful and very kind to yourself

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.920
for your penalties

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.079
in sahaja yoga is one of the biggest

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.560
mantras for all the western people

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:03.519
they should all the time saying to all

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.959
the trees

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:10.839
all the nature around i am not

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:13.199
guilty your ecological problem will

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:15.279
improve

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:17.199
because then you won't do wrong things

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:19.519
to spoil your ecology

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:21.199
you'll be careful because you spoil it

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:23.199
and you feel guilty oh i should not have

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:25.199
done this oh i should not

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:26.320
but why did you do in the first place is

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:28.079
the point

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.759
so now next time you are not going to do

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:32.160
it

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:33.839
so many of our problems will be solved

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.880
if you face them

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:39.199
and correct them boldly

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.120
it's possible for sahaja yogis because

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:43.680
you are separated from your being

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.480
you are away from it you can see your

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.880
body

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.519
you can see your mind you can see your

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.160
ego

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:52.399
you can see all of those things and you

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.279
know how to put them right

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:56.560
you are not that you know so you are the

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:59.360
spirit

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.920
with the light of the spirit you can

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.800
correct

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.360
all these things but this guilt is

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.320
something where it stops you completely

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.279
from correcting or doing anything better

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.120
about it

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:15.920
or bringing any constructive thing to

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.920
your own mind

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.199
this will solve many problems for

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.360
america

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:25.040
as well as for all the western world

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.560
same with the indians that they should

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.360
not think that if they

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.120
are generous a little bit uh they can

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.880
get rid of their mistakes you see they

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.720
have to face it

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.880
it's a different style indians are very

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.000
clever you know they know how to find

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:43.759
excuses and escapes but

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.759
after all it is vishnu maya

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:48.560
she will show you that there is no

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:50.399
escape just face it

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.079
there is no need to condemn yourself

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:54.800
don't need to

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:55.120
uh in any way degrade yourself or to

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.000
feel

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.399
inferior but to be superior as the

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.399
spiritual i see oh

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:04.799
like i would say all right well i see

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:07.360
you very well you did this

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:09.199
separate yourself from yourself you can

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.000
talk on the mirror

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:13.039
you can go to the river and talk there

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.839
or you can

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:17.520
go to an ocean and tell them that see i

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:20.160
have done this mistake

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.400
and now i am not going to do it you can

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.600
make promises to all these elements

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.240
once you make these promises this vishnu

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.880
maya

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.360
will receive the message and she won't

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.880
enter

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.520
into any one of these elements to

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.400
destruction so you have to go and tell

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.240
the ocean

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.600
that all right america is not guilty for

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.880
whatever they have done

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.280
say it like that if you say it's all

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.760
right

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.360
not other people because i told you your

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.400
genetics are changed you are different

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.520
people

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.120
whatever you say vishnu maya will always

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.400
believe in

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.840
and everything will work out very well

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.960
but this is a special time as i told you

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.480
before where we call it

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.720
is the krita yuga where between the

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.760
kali yuga and satyuga this time is so

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.840
important

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.919
that whatever mistakes we have committed

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.559
we have to pay for it

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:17.280
it's a karma palazzo it won't work out

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:20.320
by just putting it here

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:23.440
so one has to get to realization

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:27.440
change the genetics completely and then

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.440
you can go and tell the nature that all

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.200
right we are not guilty now we've got

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.679
our realization

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.880
and it will work i'm sure so many of

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.880
catastrophes

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.160
of this country can be awarded by you

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.400
sahaja yogis

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.400
may god bless you
