1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,657
Tonight we have
gathered here

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,906
to do the Puja to
the Devi,

3
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,782
that is Mahakali
- we can call Her

4
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:18,490
or Durga.

5
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:23,324
So many types of
forms She has taken,

6
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:25,782
to kill

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,824
the negative forces that
are trying to trouble

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,657
or to obstruct,

9
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,824
or even to grow

10
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:43,699
the people who were

11
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:48,365
gentle and good.

12
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,741
Her forms are of
different types

13
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,824
that we know about,

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,407
that She destroyed
so many rakshasas,

15
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:06,073
She destroyed so
many evildoers.

16
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,657
Also we do not know

17
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:12,532
that, in the World
Wars that we had,

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:18,324
She was there to protect
the right type of people.

19
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:21,866
And that’s how
they all survived

20
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:25,906
the ill-blood plan,

21
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:30,157
ill-gotten plan
of very cruel

22
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,449
and evil people.

23
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:38,741
The evil people have
a capacity to hate.

24
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:44,741
And to express their hate in
every way that is possible.

25
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:52,948
They are really born evil and
there are also who ‘become’ evil.

26
00:01:53,574 --> 00:01:57,490
When they are

27
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:03,324
born evil, you can
make them out.

28
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:07,616
That their whole style
is so aggressive,

29
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:12,198
and so vindictive

30
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,157
about things.

31
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:18,240
But hatred has no limit,

32
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,365
no limits at all.
Because, if they hate,

33
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:26,990
if they hate someone,

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,824
then, just to justify that hatred,
they’ll say all kinds of things.

35
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,407
Just to justify. But sometimes
they don’t even want to justify.

36
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:41,741
They just feel that
they ‘hate’

37
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:45,741
and it’s a fundamental right
they have got to hate.

38
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:51,365
But these forces join
together sometimes to form

39
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:56,824
to form a joint
personality of evil,

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,240
which tries to torture the
human beings and trouble them.

41
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:07,699
They might take any name. They
might call them by anything,

42
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:13,324
but they are absolutely
hundred per cent evil.

43
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:15,741
and for such persons

44
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:24,157
there’s no pity or compassion
from the God Almighty.

45
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,782
These are to be
destroyed.

46
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:29,490
And that is the job
of the Goddess

47
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:35,907
to destroy them, who is a Mother,
full of compassion and love.

48
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:41,115
It’s a very contradictory
work the Goddess has to do

49
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:46,741
to kill these people, because, in
the larger interest, it is important

50
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:54,407
that all such evil people
should be destroyed, completely.

51
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,365
But they do not.

52
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:01,449
They, like they go to jail for
some time. Like that, they

53
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,782
go to hell for some
time, suffer

54
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,699
and, again, they come
back much more strong

55
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:12,490
and then again try to trouble
good saintly people.

56
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:15,616
It’s a common style

57
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:22,073
they are all over the world.
They can come in the form

58
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:24,532
of a very good man,

59
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:29,407
of a very gentle man, or of a
man who “knows a lot about God”

60
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:33,741
or they can also say
that they can

61
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:36,532
give you Realisation.

62
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:40,365
All kinds of lies
they are capable of,

63
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:46,157
because they have that power
evil, power of doing evil.

64
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:49,449
So they take to all
kinds of falsehood

65
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:53,407
and they proclaim that:
“We are this and we are that,”

66
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:58,115
and “ We can give
you this or that.”

67
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:03,115
Actually, they have come on
this Earth to ruin people.

68
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:06,532
We’ve had many of
these false people

69
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:10,032
and many stupid
people followed them.

70
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,324
They never talked
against each other.

71
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:17,574
Christ has said that,

72
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:21,574
“The devil won’t talk
against its own house.”

73
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:26,073
As if they are in ‘one’ house.
And in ‘one’ house they live

74
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:28,157
and they cannot talk,

75
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:34,324
they cannot talk
of something

76
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:38,782
that may disturb their
collectivity or their fraternity.

77
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,574
The fraternity is so
great that,

78
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:45,699
wherever they are,
they ‘know’

79
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:50,741
that they are together.
Just imagine.

80
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:53,906
all the evil people
should join together

81
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:58,324
and behave in this manner
is very surprising.

82
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,699
That way, they are
very collective.

83
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:06,490
Supposing one has taken a
particular part of the land,

84
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:10,157
then he dominates there. Another
takes up in another way.

85
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:13,532
Third one takes. There’s
no competition as such.

86
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:17,365
Ultimate effort is, somehow
or other,

87
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:21,824
to destroy all the
creation of God,

88
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:24,073
all the good people
of the world,

89
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:29,948
who will ultimately get
their Self-Realisation

90
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:36,032
and who will have the
Knowledge about Reality.

91
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:43,157
This kind of atmosphere is
the worst during Kali Yuga

92
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,741
and there are so many
stupid, stupid people,

93
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,948
who may be simple, who
may be good-natured,

94
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,198
but they get drawn by the
evil doing of these people,

95
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:59,616
while the good people
also sometimes

96
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:04,157
follow suite. They also try to
follow them. It’s very surprising.

97
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:08,907
Why should good people not under-
stand what is good and what is bad?

98
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:12,407
But, that discrimination,
many good people also lack

99
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:15,532
and that’s why they
take to wrong things.

100
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:18,741
And then they go on
justifying all the time

101
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,449
whatever they are doing
is the right thing,

102
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:25,990
is the best thing, they
have the proof of it.

103
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:31,990
Now, as you know, there has
been many of them in Kali Yuga

104
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,782
and so many of them have now
disappeared from this Earth

105
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:43,657
and now they cannot trouble us.
But there are still some more,

106
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:45,948
who are exposed.

107
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:50,157
People have exposed
them so much

108
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:53,407
that nobody can expose

109
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:57,824
anybody without any proof.

110
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:00,073
But they have such courage

111
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:04,282
and they are so
full of confidence

112
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:07,824
that they can do
what they like,

113
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,490
and anybody tries
to expose them,

114
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,574
they will definitely
ruin that person.

115
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,032
A few things they
are doing.

116
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:21,741
First of all, they put wrong
ideas into your head.

117
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:25,032
They say that:
"We are very

118
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,574
great people we are this, we
are that. God has sent us."

119
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:30,574
All sorts of things they will talk.

120
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:33,365
But there is no proof
about it.

121
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:36,699
And human beings never
ask for the proof,

122
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:39,365
as to: “How do you say?

123
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,574
What is the proof? ”

124
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:44,907
So the solution is
the Sahaja Yoga.

125
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:50,198
In Sahaja Yoga, you have
the experience. You have the proof.

126
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:53,365
Then you grow into it.

127
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,616
Immediately you cannot be a great
Sahaja Yogi, that’s a fact.

128
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,948
You have to mature.

129
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:02,365
It takes some time
for some people.

130
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,824
It takes some more time for
other people. It doesn’t matter.

131
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:07,990
But you do mature.

132
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:11,782
In the meanwhile, if you try
to go to these wrong people,

133
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:14,365
then there is
no possibility,

134
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:18,157
there’s no way of
again bringing you up.

135
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:21,866
Especially those people who rise
high in Sahaja Yoga, I think.

136
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:25,824
If they fall,
they fall so low.

137
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,907
Then even an ordinary
Sahaja Yogi

138
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:32,407
could say: “ Mother, look at him!
Where has he gone?”

139
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:36,699
So, with all these
things happening,

140
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:42,073
what is our job

141
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,866
is to worship
Mahakali within us.

142
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:50,782
Because, what does She do?
Perhaps we are not very aware of.

143
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:56,115
First and foremost thing
She does is to protect us.

144
00:09:56,365 --> 00:10:00,574
Wherever you may be,
whatever you may be doing,

145
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:03,782
in whatever peril you
may be,

146
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:08,157
howsoever dangerously you
may be placed in life,

147
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:12,407
She protects you. First
thing, She protects you.

148
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:16,073
All the people who write to
Me, how they were protected,

149
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,616
how they were cured,
how they were helped.

150
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,449
It’s this thing: that
they should know

151
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:28,157
that all this has happened because
of Mahakali power within you.

152
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:30,782
She exists within you.

153
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,906
When you are
worshipping Mahakali,

154
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:35,490
you are worshipping the
Mahakali ‘within you’.

155
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,699
With due respect,
you must know

156
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:41,324
that this Mahakali is a
very sensitive personality.

157
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:43,906
She is very sensitive.

158
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:48,741
If you try to do any
wrong to anyone,

159
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:52,782
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell
you by many ways

160
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,324
that: "This is wrong what
you are doing.

161
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:57,324
Why are you doing wrong
to some person?”

162
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,699
But if you do not repent

163
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:04,282
and come back onto the normal
position, She gives you up.

164
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:09,365
Once Mahakali gives you
up, you are now exposed

165
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:13,741
and become prone to all
kinds of evil things.

166
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:16,407
I would say…

167
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:22,699
“What’s the matter
with the baby?”

168
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:47,115
So, when you worship
Her, what do you want?

169
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:52,616
You want Her to protect you.
In your discrimination,

170
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:57,324
in your mistake, you might
do something wrong.

171
00:11:57,574 --> 00:12:01,699
May do something that
is not good for you,

172
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:04,782
could be very dangerous
for you.

173
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:08,115
But She is the person
who guides

174
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:10,490
how to avoid all
the dangers.

175
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:15,407
Now, She protects
your life,

176
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,657
She protects your body,

177
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,906
She protects all organs
of your body,

178
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:26,157
She is the One who gives you
all the security of life.

179
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:32,532
In Her realm, you feel
completely secure.

180
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:35,574
You are never afraid
of anything.

181
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:39,532
Because you have left Her
realm, you have come out of it,

182
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:42,824
that is why, that is the
reason you are afraid.

183
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,824
But if you are under
Her beautiful

184
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:50,866
guidance and Her
blessings,

185
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:54,324
you will never feel
afraid to do anything.

186
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,073
You will never do
anything wrong also.

187
00:12:57,282 --> 00:13:01,115
As soon as you’ll try to do
wrong, She will hold your hand.

188
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,907
She is really the
guiding person.

189
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:08,157
She is the One who actually
gives us our existence.

190
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:13,032
Without Her, we
cannot exist, because

191
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:20,866
She is the One who is
the Power of Shri Shiva.

192
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:27,282
She gives us so many things.
For example,

193
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:33,824
She gives us the
relaxation, the sleep.

194
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:36,449
She gives you the Truth.

195
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,532
She tells you what is the
Truth and what is not.

196
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,157
Sometimes people

197
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,782
so much in their ego
always try to believe that:

198
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,657
“What I think is
the truth.”

199
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:52,948
Then She is the One who points
it out by creating a ‘Maya’,

200
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,198
a kind of a confusion,

201
00:13:57,532 --> 00:14:00,906
that you start thinking:
“What is this?”

202
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:06,532
So She is called also the One who
gives us ‘Bhranti,’ means illusions.

203
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:09,990
She puts you to illusions
also. She tells you

204
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,782
puts you to illusions
and She

205
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:16,532
then ultimately takes you
out of the illusions.

206
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,365
She is the One who
relaxes you,

207
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,948
because She takes over all
your responsibilities.

208
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,407
She takes over all
your problems.

209
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,866
She is the One who
solves all the problems.

210
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:32,407
It is we who forget to leave
all the problems to Her.

211
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:37,616
If you just leave problems to Her,
all your problems are solved.

212
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:41,616
Not only that, but you
really feel blessed.

213
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:46,073
It’s not only physical,
also it is mental

214
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:50,741
that She makes your mind
absolutely free of worries.

215
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:55,490
She doesn’t worry and She
doesn’t want you to worry.

216
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,574
If you worry, then
She tries to show that,

217
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:01,990
by your worry,
you are denying Her.

218
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:04,616
You are not accepting Her.

219
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:07,032
Worrying is something
very common

220
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,948
and people take great
pride in saying:

221
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:10,449
“Oh, I was worried.”

222
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:15,449
How can you be worried when your
Mother is “Sakshat Mahakali”.

223
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:19,407
She can kill all the demons.
She can finish all of them.

224
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,365
She knows how
to manage things.

225
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:24,657
And when you are like
a child before Her,

226
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:27,240
how can you worry
about anything?

227
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:30,032
So your worries
are finished.

228
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:33,324
She worries about you, you
shouldn’t worry about yourself.

229
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:38,240
That’s the point of it. Her
security is so great,

230
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:41,616
She is so secure
Herself, that

231
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:45,866
She gives you all the
security that you need.

232
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:48,699
You can hold on
to Her feet.

233
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,157
You can hold on to Her
image or to anything.

234
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,324
You can even pray to Her.

235
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:59,616
Many people are being cured
only by praying to Her.

236
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:01,824
Because She cures you.

237
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:03,990
She can cure your
diseases,

238
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,906
which are very complicated
diseases. She can cure.

239
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:13,157
Now what She likes ?
Mahakali likes the light.

240
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:17,866
She is worshipped in the night,
because then we can put on the light.

241
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:21,198
She likes enlightened
persons.

242
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:25,906
Also She likes the light.
She likes the Sun. She likes,

243
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:31,574
something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

244
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:36,948
You must have heard about people
who are called… I don’t know what,

245
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,407
but especially in the
West they use them.

246
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:46,157
They have big teeth
and they

247
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:48,948
somebody from the audience
shouts: “vampires.”

248
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,906
And they are the people,
they just imagine,

249
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:57,073
they cannot exist
before the Sun.

250
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:03,073
As soon as there is a sunrise,
they just want to go off and sleep.

251
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:08,365
Yes, they cannot see the Sun,
because, the light, they can’t bear.

252
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:13,032
Now, what has happened here,
that Mahalakshmi, has departed.

253
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,407
Mahakali has departed
from them.

254
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:21,616
And when Mahakali has departed,
then they are afraid.

255
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:26,115
And such people are
attacked by these people

256
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:29,032
who know they are afraid.

257
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:33,574
The Sun itself is
very important,

258
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:36,490
to work out this
Mahakali thing.

259
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:40,324
But, as it is, in the
West especially,

260
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:44,115
we are very hard-working

261
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:48,990
and very much Sun-oriented
and we worship the Sun.

262
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,574
All this we do,
worship the Sun

263
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,948
and also go right-sided
very much.

264
00:17:57,198 --> 00:17:59,782
Then it is She who
gives us the balance.

265
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,365
She is the One who
gives us the balance,

266
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:08,282
by relaxing us completely
and protecting us.

267
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:13,906
Sometimes we are competitive
and we are really worried

268
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:18,574
and we want to do something
which we cannot do.

269
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:22,407
Then we get upset

270
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:24,574
and we don’t know
what to do.

271
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:29,616
Then it is She who
brings sleep to us.

272
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:34,616
So, when we sleep, She looks
after us, She soothes us

273
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:37,657
and She takes away
our problems.

274
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,866
So many things
She is doing.

275
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:43,616
But what are we doing for Her?
That we should see.

276
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,198
Main thing is,

277
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:52,574
that we are ourselves
worshipping Her.

278
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:58,824
She likes it that Her
children should worship Her,

279
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:02,699
that, on that level, She
can be One with them.

280
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:07,906
She can give them Her
compassion, love and protection

281
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:10,449
from all the evil.

282
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:14,948
But it has to be
understood, those who are

283
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:20,115
not yet settled, those
who are not absolutelly

284
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:26,616
belonging to that land
of security of Mahakali,

285
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,824
can be attacked.

286
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:35,574
And they… once they leave that
area, they can be very badly

287
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:40,324
injured, killed, whatever
way can happen.

288
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:42,782
So, we are living in
this Kali Yuga

289
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,741
in very dangerous times.

290
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:51,073
Whence anything
can happen.

291
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,115
So we have to be
very careful.

292
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:58,657
We have to watch our mind,
to see how it works.

293
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,365
What does it teach you?
What does it tell you?

294
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,198
Try to understand

295
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:10,449
what is the plan of
this evil person,

296
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,907
that you are playing
into his hands?

297
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:16,407
How can you play
into his hands

298
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:20,866
and how can you do whatever
wrong he wants you to do?

299
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:24,616
Secondly, against
Her is the ego.

300
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:28,365
The biggest problem
is the ego today.

301
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,699
Ego will show:
“No, no, I can do this.”

302
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:35,365
Ego says:
“I will work it out.”

303
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,574
Ego says:
“It will be done.”

304
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:43,324
But the human beings –
see – yield to ego.

305
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:48,407
It’s of a great satisfaction to
them that their ego is so strong.

306
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:54,073
and they don’t want to listen
to the Mahakali forces.

307
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:59,240
Take the boy (Anant)
outside.

308
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:06,073
He wants Me, you see.
Children are like that.

309
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:09,906
They can’t leave
you for even…

310
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:19,282
You have to be like children.
Really, that’s the very best way,

311
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,906
is to be innocent like children.
She loves innocent people.

312
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,948
She is Innocence Herself.
She loves innocent people

313
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:30,616
and She looks after
you much more

314
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:33,240
because you are innocent.
You are not cunning.

315
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,198
You are not very much...

316
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:43,198
trying to play your
ego on others.

317
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,490
If you are innocent,
She’ll help you.

318
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,906
She definitely will
help you.

319
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:52,657
But this ego has to be
brought under control,

320
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:56,741
because he is
the worst enemy

321
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,990
She has. She doesn’t
like your ego.

322
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,365
She wants you to be
ego-less, to be innocent.

323
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:09,990
As you know that it is, first She
came and She created Shri Ganesha

324
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:13,741
That’s why we worship
Shri Ganesha.

325
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,906
We have to be innocent.

326
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:20,407
Means: we are not
planning to do something

327
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:25,490
bad or good or anything, but
we are without any intentions.

328
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:33,574
We are just…It’s
a timeless activity.

329
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:36,782
You just don’t bother about
what you are going to do,

330
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,699
what you are not going to do,
what you should do.

331
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,282
Nothing of the kind!

332
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:46,073
You are just existing
in your complete innocence

333
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,948
and enjoying yourself and
making others enjoy.

334
00:22:50,157 --> 00:22:54,407
If there’s one child in the house,
he can make hundred people dance.

335
00:22:54,657 --> 00:23:00,490
It’s like that. Because these
children have the power of innocence.

336
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:06,157
and that is what She respects.
We sometimes feel that,

337
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,866
how people are cheats.
How they cheat us!

338
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:14,365
How they make
all kinds of,

339
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:20,198
I should say - aggressiveness!
Sometimes, how they try to

340
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,282
also tell lies!

341
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,115
All kinds of things
they will do

342
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:28,115
and they expect so
much from you also.

343
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:33,198
But all this is
happening… is happening.

344
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,282
You shouldn’t bother
about these things.

345
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:37,490
You should keep
to your innocence

346
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:42,073
and, you’ll be surprised,
you’ll be completely protected.

347
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,948
How? Because Mahakali
will stand around you.

348
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:52,157
She will look after you,
if you are innocent.

349
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:56,990
Innocent person doesn’t get angry.
What is there to get angry?

350
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,240
Innocence has its
own, I should say,

351
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,282
strength, power. It’s
extremely powerful.

352
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:10,906
Even a cruel man,
if he sees a child,

353
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:14,699
he becomes a little bit aware
of it: “There’s a child.”

354
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:18,574
The whole world is aware
that children should not be

355
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,407
any way tortured
or troubled. Why?

356
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:27,449
Because children are so innocent.
So the quality of innocence

357
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,657
is going to really
help you very much,

358
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:36,574
because She appreciates
your quality of innocence.

359
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:41,866
Then another thing She loves
in you is your compassion.

360
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:45,906
Compassion for each other.
Love for each other.

361
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:51,282
Also caring for others. That
is something She loves.

362
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,616
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if
you are a Realised Soul,

363
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:56,157
She is always with you.

364
00:24:56,407 --> 00:25:01,324
But She says: “What are you
doing with your compassion?

365
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:03,906
How many people you are
giving Realisation?

366
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:08,073
How many people
you are curing?

367
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,282
How many people
you are helping?

368
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:13,824
She is quite aware of
whatever you are doing.

369
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,490
I should say, it’s such a
tremendous power of Mahakali

370
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:21,824
that She knows
everything about you.

371
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:24,449
Everything! She knows
your mind.

372
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:26,407
She knows about
your heart.

373
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,490
She knows about
your health.

374
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:32,906
Everything  She knows.
Actually, She is the Mother,

375
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:37,866
in every way, who cares
for the little child.

376
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:41,782
In that way, She knows that
this child doesn’t do anything.

377
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:43,240
He’s very innocent.

378
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,906
So, like, when you are very small,
your mother looks after you.

379
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:51,906
In the same way, this
Mahakali looks after you.

380
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:56,866
Then the Mahasaraswati
power comes in and She

381
00:25:57,282 --> 00:26:00,198
educates you.
She gives you

382
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:04,948
other ideas of knowledge…
this, that.

383
00:26:05,198 --> 00:26:08,866
But, looking after
the child in you,

384
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:13,490
looking after your innocence
and your compassion,

385
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:16,365
is all done by this
Mahakali power.

386
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:20,948
So, She is extremely sensitive
about Her children.

387
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:23,699
Nobody dare touch
Her children!

388
00:26:23,906 --> 00:26:27,157
For Her, everybody
is like a child.

389
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:31,365
Those who are Realised Souls
especially, She thinks are children

390
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:34,073
and in no way they
should be hurt.

391
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:37,866
Nothing should happen to them.
She is always following them.

392
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:41,407
One can say: “If She is a ‘person’,
how does She follow them?”

393
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:46,324
Because She is
‘omnipresent’.

394
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:49,115
She is present
everywhere.

395
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:52,824
Everywhere in your
life She is there.

396
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,699
Especially with Sahaja Yogis,
She follows them up and down.

397
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,240
Everywhere,

398
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,032
whatever you are doing.
You are in an accident

399
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,198
She is there to save you.

400
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:08,198
She is like an angel behind you
and nothing can happen to you,

401
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,948
if you really worship Her
from your full heart.

402
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:16,948
Not for any gain, not
for any achievement,

403
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:20,657
but for Her blessings.

404
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,906
Her blessings are
very great

405
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:27,699
and they really have
enriched human beings.

406
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:31,907
They have enriched this Earth.
They have enriched everything,

407
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:36,157
because of the
blessings of Mahakali.

408
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:39,240
Of course, then, there
comes the Mahalakshmi.

409
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,824
Her thing is that,

410
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,407
in Mahalakshmi principle, you
become ‘sort of detached’.

411
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:51,240
You start finding that:
“What is this world after all?”

412
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,906
and a kind of a feeling

413
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:59,240
of detachment comes into you
and you start thinking

414
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,824
that there must be something better,
there must be truth beyond.

415
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:07,490
Especially people who have
been tortured by bad people

416
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:08,990
always think like that.

417
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,741
That: “There must be someone
who will raise us from this.”

418
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:17,157
Here comes the Mahalakshmi
principle in you

419
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,449
which is the principle
of the Goddess

420
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:25,115
of ‘Ascent’.

421
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:30,198
She puts the ideas in your
head that: “What is next?

422
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:35,490
What do we have to do? After all,
is this the end of our life?

423
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:39,574
What is the purpose of our life?
Why have we come on this Earth?

424
00:28:39,824 --> 00:28:43,948
What is so special that we
should live on this Earth?”

425
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,115
All such fundamental
questions start rising

426
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:51,741
and then he just takes
to the seeking.

427
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,449
In that also, you
have to understand

428
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:57,907
the Mahalakshmi principle
is very, very,

429
00:28:58,157 --> 00:29:01,866
very different from what
people understand.

430
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,532
They think -if
they are seeking,

431
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:06,407
it should be intelligible,

432
00:29:06,616 --> 00:29:08,574
it should be through
their mindsall this…

433
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,990
or could be rational

434
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:13,365
or scientific.

435
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:17,657
That’s how they move,
seeking the truth.

436
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,324
It’s not possible!

437
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:23,073
Mahalakshmi’s principle
is like this:

438
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:25,866
that you should have earnest

439
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:30,532
desire to know the Truth and Truth
and Truth – and nothing else.

440
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:32,906
When you think like that,

441
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:35,324
then you will not take
to other things.

442
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:37,532
So many people took to drugs,

443
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:41,906
thinking that, by doing that, they
will achieve their Self-Realisation.

444
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:43,490
It’s a wrong idea.

445
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:48,699
How can you get away from your awareness?
Can achieve that?

446
00:29:48,907 --> 00:29:53,157
Awareness is the most
important thing.

447
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:56,115
If you can go

448
00:29:56,741 --> 00:30:00,365
into the realm
of awareness,

449
00:30:00,616 --> 00:30:05,115
then you have to understand that the
basic awareness is not to be lost.

450
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,324
If your basic awareness
is lost,

451
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,906
through drinking or through drugs
or all these things that people do.

452
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:15,157
They think that they are seeking,
that’s why they are doing.

453
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:21,574
So sometimes they take excuse of
‘seeking’ to do wrong things.

454
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:25,657
It’s like a revenge on
your Self, I think,

455
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,616
that you want
to revenge yourself

456
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:32,449
by thinking that you
are now ‘seeking’.

457
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:34,741
It’s not the real seeking.

458
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:39,906
In a real seeking, a person
has to just meditate

459
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:43,407
and should find out
what is the right way.

460
00:30:43,657 --> 00:30:46,240
But, that too, not by
reading some books

461
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:48,990
or listening to
some false gurus.

462
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:53,490
Actually, Kundalini
awakening is the only way

463
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:57,198
one can know the Reality.
There’s no other way out.

464
00:30:57,449 --> 00:31:01,490
But nobody tells them that
it is Kundalini awakening.

465
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:03,616
They’ll tell you:
“We’ll go to this place,

466
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:06,115
then to that place,
then more to that place.

467
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,616
Then this has
to be done…

468
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,032
And, ultimately, where do
you come? Where you started!

469
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:15,657
Just like that: moving
from places to places.

470
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:19,115
Moving from false

471
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:23,324
to another false, to another
false,… to falsehood.

472
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:26,948
Ultimately so many
seekers have been lost.

473
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,699
So many have been
lost, because

474
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:37,282
they thought that certain
type of… is very precious,

475
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:39,240
seeking is very ‘precious’,

476
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,824
because you can pay lots
of money to the guru.

477
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,948
I mean, you can
‘purchase’ the guru.

478
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:48,741
And so: “All the rich people
can become enlightened.”

479
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,073
That means that.

480
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:55,490
But I don’t think that the percent-
age of good people are only rich.

481
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:57,906
The people who are

482
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:02,407
good are good. Whether they are
rich or not is not the point.

483
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:06,324
But such people try to
gather round a person,

484
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:10,449
because, I think, there’s a
subtle ego of their money,

485
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:14,073
that: “We can afford to
buy this, buy that.”

486
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:19,032
Once I was in America and there
was one lady who came to see Me

487
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:23,490
and she didn’t know that I
was… a spiritual person.

488
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:28,157
So she said: “Now there’s a very
good guru who has come to America.”

489
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:29,990
I said: “Really?
What does he do?

490
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,824
She said: “There’s a sale
on.” I said: “Really?”

491
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:37,407
“You can pay him
half the amount:

492
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:40,907
he can give you his blessings.
Alright?”

493
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:45,616
Then next week, she said: “Now
the sale has come to one fourth.

494
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:48,115
If you pay the one
fourth amount,

495
00:32:48,324 --> 00:32:50,782
then he will give you
the ‘full’ knowledge.”

496
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:53,574
I said: “How can
it be reciprocal?

497
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:55,948
It’s not proportionate!”
I said:

498
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:59,324
“You were giving half,
he was giving you half,

499
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:01,574
and when you are giving
one-fourth, he is giving you full.”

500
00:33:01,824 --> 00:33:03,449
“That’s the thing”
she said,

501
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:07,824
“he’s very magnanimous, you see.
That’s the point.”

502
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:13,324
I said: “For all such people who
think they can purchase Truth,

503
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:17,906
they cannot achieve it.
You cannot purchase it.

504
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:22,990
You cannot pay for your
Kundalini awakening. No!

505
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:26,157
Nor you should take any
payment for that.

506
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:32,073
Self-Realisation is
absolutely the Divine Grace.

507
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:36,282
And you cannot take
money for that.

508
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:41,115
You cannot sell it. It’s not
so ‘cheap’ to be sold.

509
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:46,741
If you understand that, then
the Mahalakshmi power works.

510
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:48,948
And Mahalakshmi power is

511
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:52,449
really meant for people who
are really genuine seekers,

512
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:57,824
who are really seeking genuinely.
It acts and works so well,

513
00:33:58,073 --> 00:34:03,198
that they achieve a
kind of a very, very

514
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,616
spontaneous Realisation.

515
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:11,073
This spontaneous Realisation,
you all have got it.

516
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:15,407
You don’t have to go to Himalayas. You
don’t have to do anything like that.

517
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:19,906
All those things are over.
You have done it.

518
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:22,699
In your previous lives,
you must have done it.

519
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:24,449
Now you don’t have
to do anything.

520
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:28,782
You can get it, you are getting
it just sitting down here.

521
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,282
Wherever you are in the
whole world, you can get it

522
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,407
and it is spreading
very fast.

523
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:40,948
Now, it’s also the duty of Sahaja
Yogis to spread Sahaja Yoga.

524
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:45,906
Now, this one is

525
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:50,240
to be understood: that
Mahalakshmi and Mahakali

526
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:54,324
both go hand in hand.

527
00:34:54,574 --> 00:34:58,824
When, you see,
Mahakali blesses you

528
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:02,574
and She is with you and
you are in Her realm,

529
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:04,699
the Mahalakshmi comes
forward

530
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:08,616
and She definitely helps you
to achieve your Realisation

531
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:13,157
and also to improve
your problems,

532
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:17,324
to help you. I mean - the financial
side of it, you can call it,

533
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,282
or in any way other

534
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,616
problems also She solves. The
greatest problem She solves

535
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:29,532
that your greatest desire to achieve
Self-Realisation, is granted.

536
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:33,032
So, there is no competition
between Them.

537
00:35:33,324 --> 00:35:36,866
All these three powers
work together,

538
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:40,906
and, whatever is needed,
they work it out.

539
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:46,782
But it is the Mahakali who
guides where what help has to go

540
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,282
and that’s why the power of
Mahakali is very much respected.

541
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:58,948
As it is, She has killed so many
devils and so many rakshasas

542
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,906
and there are still more –
some of them are existing

543
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:05,198
but I am sure they
will be all finished.

544
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:11,073
There will be none of these
horrible ones ever existing.

545
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:15,824
But still we have to be
very careful and alert

546
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,490
and try to find out what’s
wrong with these people.

547
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:24,782
What are they doing and what
they trying to propagate?

548
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,906
You must mature in
such a manner that

549
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:34,240
you should know everything
of all these evil doers.

550
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:38,324
You must find out what these
false people are doing.

551
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:42,449
See, it’s really easy, because
you are enlightened.

552
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:46,782
And with your enlightened attention,
you can definitely find out

553
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:51,490
what’s wrong with
what organisation,

554
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:55,782
with each evil man,
evildoer.

555
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:59,365
It will be… the best
way is to meditate.

556
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:01,532
Not to be aggressive
in any way.

557
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:06,449
But just to meditate and
ask Mahakali: “Destroy!

558
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:10,990
Destroy him, for he is destroying
the world. You please destroy him!”

559
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,449
That’s Her job and
She’d love to do it,

560
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:16,449
but somebody has to
tell Her and ask Her.

561
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:19,824
It’s very good, because
there are so many,

562
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,365
that unless and until
you point it out,

563
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,824
She may not be able to put Her
attention to that - possibly.

564
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,490
So it’s best is always
ask Her to help you.

565
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:34,282
On individual basis.
On a national basis.

566
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:39,240
Maybe on a collective basis
or maybe on a global basis.

567
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:44,532
That’s what. She exists everywhere.
She is globally available.

568
00:37:44,782 --> 00:37:46,782
Anywhere: you may
be having

569
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:51,699
any colour, any race,
any nation - anything.

570
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:55,574
but She exists within
you all the time.

571
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:59,282
And to worship Her
and to awaken Her,

572
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:03,365
is only ‘your’ due,
that ‘you’ have to do.

573
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:06,907
If She is awakened within you,
you’ll be a humble person.

574
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:09,741
You will see what mistakes
you have been committing

575
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:13,449
and you’ll feel bad about it.
You will not feel ‘guilty’,

576
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:14,657
but you will feel ‘bad’,

577
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:17,866
that: I will never do such a thing.
I have done very great wrong.

578
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:20,324
And then you will
try to correct it.

579
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:22,990
All this works out

580
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:26,907
very well when you are
pure in your heart.

581
00:38:27,157 --> 00:38:31,324
Your heart should be pure.
If your heart is not pure,

582
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:38,782
if you are doing Sahaja Yoga to
have some competition with others

583
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:43,990
or with some sort of material
achievements, it will not work out.

584
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:49,782
You have to do it in a way
that is an innocent act,

585
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:53,574
that you are worshipping your
Mother like a little child

586
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:55,616
worships and loves
his mother.

587
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,699
It’s a very simple relationship,
which all of us have felt,

588
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:02,616
how we should love
our Mother and

589
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:08,240
how we should be under Her
guidance and under Her protection.

590
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,115
That is something very simple you
have known in your childhood

591
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:15,240
and that childhood has
to come back in you

592
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:18,282
if you really
worship the Mother.

593
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:21,741
May God Bless you.
