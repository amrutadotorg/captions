1
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:10,059
The Shakti of forgiveness too is great.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,999
You should also learn to forgive.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,205
I see that, in Sahaja Yoga people forgive very little.

4
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:16,609
Learn to forgive,

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,606
Without forgiving, you cannot get realisation on your own.

6
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,832
For example, if somebody has hurt you,

7
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:26,311
and you didn't forgive him, then what did you do?

8
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,068
You didn't do anything.

9
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:32,743
If you didn't forgive, means, you didn't do anything.

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,353
Even if you forgive, strictly speaking means you didn't do anything.

11
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,867
But if you say, i forgive,

12
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:42,467
then by not forgiving, you were playing in other's hands

13
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:45,138
he loses all his Shakti.

14
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,067
The destructive power gets destroyed.

15
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,193
But those who are forgiving,

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,907
their Shakti is so powerful, that wherever they stand,

17
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:57,943
because of their forgiveness, people can become pious.

18
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:00,877
Their vices of numerous births, can be washed out.

19
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:02,757
From all previous birth's

20
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:06,352
whatsoever problems, they have accumulated, can be over,

21
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:08,280
because, he they have forgiven.

22
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,407
Redemption from all sins is obtained only by kshma Shakti.

23
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:16,434
Many a times, we say to God, "You are ocean of forgiveness !"

24
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:19,353
We also say, that you are the remover of sins.

25
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:22,126
We also say, "Destroy our papaas."

26
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:24,286
How can He do? Only by forgiveness !

27
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:26,417
By his uttering only one word 'forgive',

28
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:30,394
by his one sight, by the sight of forgiveness only,

29
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:32,214
all the sins are destroyed.

30
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:34,975
But because we have not seen such people,

31
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:38,689
We don't even think about such people,

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,826
We can't even believe, that such people can be in the world.

33
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:46,377
We have to find such people today.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,376
And you know, what you were, are not today.

35
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:53,854
and what you are today, you won't be like that tomorrow.

36
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:56,464
Tommorow, such people will be in Sahaja Yoga,

37
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:59,296
who have kindness, forgiveness and peacefulness.

38
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,163
All these Shakhtis, are ignited.

39
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:05,245
On account of those, We will get all type of

40
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,110
comfort, pleasure and peace in the whole universe.

41
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:12,289
Those who have said,"I will do this, i will do that,

42
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,977
will bring all the comfort to the world,"

43
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:18,371
and many have said, that the world should be filled with happiness.

44
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:24,781
Marx has said, and you have come to know that many saints have said,

45
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:28,732
that whole world should be joyful. How can it be?

46
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,117
There is only one way.

47
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:35,065
When a human being, in his ascent, will find his Kundalini awakened

48
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:41,127
then his mental, spiritual and physical, material assets

49
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,985
not only this much, but in all respects

50
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:48,545
his Shakti will be so transformable,

51
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,815
that he will be able to transform every thing.

52
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:54,967
If there is any problem he will transform it
if there is a wave he will transform it

53
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,249
if there is a mountain he can climb it.

54
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,094
This great Shakti can come inside your being through Kundalini,

55
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:02,996
because you have achieved your Spirit.

56
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,494
So to receive this Shakti,

57
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,439
the small small laws of Sahaja Yoga should be followed.

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,524
First of all, forgive your self,

59
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:13,212
first of all, love yourself,

60
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,444
First of all know your self esteem.
