00:01.444 --> 00:05.060
Today I told you about Kundalini,

00:05.261 --> 00:12.593
and that Kundalini is the Pure Desire
within us,

00:16.274 --> 00:22.018
that manifests or is awakened

00:23.899 --> 00:27.483
to give us our Self-realization.

00:29.220 --> 00:36.178
Means the desire is only fulfilled when
you get your Self-realization,

00:36.379 --> 00:40.943
otherwise it is not manifested – it is just
dormant;

00:42.520 --> 00:49.825
it is still residual. It has created
the whole universe,

00:50.026 --> 00:56.679
but until and unless you get
Self-realization,

00:57.443 --> 01:03.816
unless and until you become one with
your Spirit,

01:05.716 --> 01:10.026
you have not achieved the manifestation
of this power,

01:10.227 --> 01:15.322
which will go on making you run and run
and run,

01:15.523 --> 01:19.832
thinking that you have not yet achieved,
or you have not found out your meaning.

01:20.033 --> 01:24.771
It will be there, all the time, sleeping,

01:24.972 --> 01:28.878
but giving you a feeling of vacuum,
you see.

01:29.079 --> 01:34.381
So this power must be made to manifest,

01:34.582 --> 01:37.684
but when it manifests…

01:38.468 --> 01:43.184
[Shri Mataji pauses to comfort an
infant: “What’s it? What happened?

01:43.385 --> 01:47.587
Well, let it be, let him sit down, come.
What happened? Come along.

01:47.788 --> 01:52.248
What’s happening? Eh? It’s alright."

01:52.449 --> 01:58.946
(Shri Mataji kisses the child) “Alright.
Alright?” (The baby: “Yes”) “Good.

02:06.818 --> 02:13.327
Now one has to keep quiet, alright?”
(Shri Mataji kisses the child.)]

02:13.549 --> 02:19.755
Then, this power has got certain qualities.

02:24.508 --> 02:27.433
The first quality it has got, this is
ungrahavati,

02:27.634 --> 02:32.736
means it goes against the gravity.

02:35.696 --> 02:40.629
It goes against the gravity. You see,
a thing rises,

02:41.635 --> 02:44.228
it doesn’t go down.

02:45.684 --> 02:51.749
So a person who has to be aspiring
by nature.

02:51.950 --> 02:58.172
If a person is not aspiring type
the Kundalini doesn’t rise.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.184
Because, like, you see that, when food
passes down our stomach

03:03.385 --> 03:09.014
it presses the sides of the intestines.

03:09.215 --> 03:14.358
By that these movements of going down
takes place. Do you see my point?

03:14.559 --> 03:20.761
So when the Kundalini starts, and starts
pressing on the sides of the chakras,

03:21.055 --> 03:25.905
she creates a feeling of throwing it higher
and higher,

03:26.106 --> 03:29.680
so the chakras bounce it upward.

03:33.552 --> 03:36.614
All the heavy things,

03:39.915 --> 03:43.431
all go downward,

03:45.970 --> 03:52.979
but the Kundalini rises higher and higher
and higher, because it is like fire.

03:53.180 --> 03:58.632
Fire never burns downward. It always
burns upward.

04:01.033 --> 04:09.084
She looks also like fire, and she has
the capacity of fire within her.

04:11.079 --> 04:21.368
The fire has a capacity to purify, and to
burn off whatever can be burnt off.

04:21.569 --> 04:25.537
It purifies the things which it cannot
burn,

04:25.738 --> 04:29.709
and burns off the things which are
inflammable, which can be burnt out.

04:29.910 --> 04:34.378
[Aside: “Come along, come forward”.
Man: “Thank you very much”.]

04:45.183 --> 04:50.611
So, the quality of fire that exists
in the Kundalini

04:54.166 --> 04:57.770
burns off whatever is useless.

04:57.976 --> 05:03.255
Like in our house we find all the useless
things, and we take them in the garden

05:03.456 --> 05:07.854
and burn them off, finished – once for all
they are finished.

05:08.055 --> 05:12.036
So when the Kundalini rises, she also burns
off all useless things that you have,

05:12.237 --> 05:18.938
all your useless desires, your useless
ideas of action,

05:19.139 --> 05:25.828
all sorts of useless accumulation
of feelings and egos,

05:26.029 --> 05:29.288
and every sort of a nonsensical thing that
is in between.

05:29.473 --> 05:33.051
Everything is burnt off fast, because they
can be burnt,

05:33.252 --> 05:39.502
they are not eternal by nature. They are
not eternal by nature.

05:39.703 --> 05:45.625
They are temporarily there. All that is
temporary, she burns off,

05:47.191 --> 05:53.666
and that’s how she enlightens the Spirit,
because Spirit cannot be burnt by anything.

05:55.455 --> 06:03.501
But this burning is so beautiful that it
burns off all that is bad, stagnating,

06:03.702 --> 06:08.918
all that is polluting, all that is
a disease,

06:09.586 --> 06:12.767
and cools down the system.

06:14.874 --> 06:22.163
It is very interesting to see how this
power of fire becomes the cool breeze,

06:22.593 --> 06:26.938
but in the science also you find that
electricity can give you

06:27.139 --> 06:30.431
hot breeze or cool breeze.

06:30.972 --> 06:33.647
You can transform from one to another,

06:33.848 --> 06:37.675
but there is no ultimate for these things,
they are always reversible.

06:37.876 --> 06:41.723
Supposing something becomes a magnetism,
you can always convert into electricity,

06:41.924 --> 06:45.229
electricity can always be converted
into magnetism.

06:45.430 --> 06:50.003
But Kundalini is such a thing that once
she burns off

06:50.204 --> 06:56.406
everything that is there, that’s how you
get heat, because she’s burning.

06:56.607 --> 07:03.308
But when she cools down and becomes cool
then she is not reversible.

07:04.292 --> 07:09.969
That’s why it is a living process. Living
process is never reversible.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.876
All dead processes can be reversible,

07:13.077 --> 07:16.288
but anything that is reversible – now,
supposing you are grown up:

07:16.449 --> 07:20.321
you cannot become a little baby. Whatever
you may try -

07:20.522 --> 07:25.461
you may have any number of operations -
you cannot become that.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.047
Now you are grown up, now you are modern,
over-developed.

07:32.248 --> 07:35.543
You may try anything to become a primitive
person – you cannot.

07:35.744 --> 07:41.897
You just cannot, whatever you may try.
That will be all very artificial.

07:43.303 --> 07:47.212
You may just feel that you have become
primitive by wearing some sort of a dress,

07:47.413 --> 07:51.751
by feeling that, ‘Oh, now there’s no
modernism in us, and now we have become

07:51.952 --> 07:55.228
very, very subdued’, nothing of the kind.

07:56.396 --> 08:03.465
It is curable, but not reversible. But,
it’s a living process.

08:03.666 --> 08:12.327
So, Kundalini within us expedites the
living process within us of our evolution.

08:14.608 --> 08:21.658
So the power of Kundalini is to purify,
she purifies us like fire.

08:25.937 --> 08:31.403
She doesn’t purify us like water, it’s
surprising,

08:32.413 --> 08:36.977
she doesn’t purify us like water. Now,
water, what does the water do?

08:37.178 --> 08:44.456
Water never burns off anything, but
it dissolves certain things.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.889
It can take in something within itself,
you see?

08:48.066 --> 08:51.093
It can contain some of the dirt within
itself.

08:51.294 --> 08:55.076
Supposing you put a color in the water –
it assumes the color.

08:55.277 --> 08:58.861
But Kundalini does not assume the color.

08:59.482 --> 09:03.515
She burns off. Do you follow My point?

09:03.716 --> 09:08.656
So, if you have anything wrong within you,
she’ll burn it off,

09:08.857 --> 09:12.431
but she’ll not absorb – she’s pure.

09:14.623 --> 09:17.434
She cannot absorb

09:18.817 --> 09:25.601
those things into her that will pollute her.
She cannot be polluted.

09:28.924 --> 09:33.959
This quality of fire -

09:34.160 --> 09:40.090
say for example, if you put gold in fire,
silver in fire, you can purify these things.

09:40.291 --> 09:43.484
Their pure form comes in… That’s how
you know.

09:43.653 --> 09:49.010
But if you put gold and fire in water,
nothing will happen.

09:49.211 --> 09:55.265
At the most you can wash them from outside.
But in and out you cannot do it.

09:56.310 --> 10:02.850
So outwardly you can do with other things,
but with Kundalini you do in and out.

10:04.310 --> 10:07.437
The face also looks beautiful,

10:07.638 --> 10:15.713
as if some glazing has taken place
on the face, a new, bright face.

10:15.914 --> 10:23.784
It’s not sallow, neither it is horribly
burning,

10:23.985 --> 10:28.860
nor is it pale and ugly-looking,

10:29.061 --> 10:36.646
but it becomes radiant. Radiance, that’s
what Kundalini gives you.

10:37.462 --> 10:45.136
It looks also, as if a molten

10:46.914 --> 10:49.117
iron, you see - have you seen molten
iron? –

10:49.318 --> 10:56.290
Pillar of – supposing you take a pillar
of iron and, and heat it,

10:56.491 --> 11:01.245
to a point where it starts showing,
you see, copper, every color in it,

11:02.063 --> 11:05.487
copperish and all sorts of color you see,
see it’s golden, copperish and all that,

11:05.688 --> 11:10.171
you see, like a furnace. But very silently,

11:11.693 --> 11:15.691
very silent, it works out.

11:17.084 --> 11:19.640
Now, the sound of Kundalini

11:19.841 --> 11:23.680
I have told you in one of My lectures,
how it creates sound.

11:23.881 --> 11:30.814
For example at Vishuddhi, it creates
the sound of all the vowels

11:31.409 --> 11:35.253
that are in Sanskrit language. The English
vowels are very few.

11:35.430 --> 11:42.674
Sanskrit language are a aa – i ii – u uu –
ru ruu – lru lruu –

11:42.875 --> 11:50.210
e aì – o aù – am ah. These are the sounds
at Vishuddhi we can say.

11:51.152 --> 11:55.543
But she creates sounds on all the chakras,

11:55.781 --> 12:03.086
but when she comes to Nabhi it becomes
a vani.

12:03.323 --> 12:07.181
Vani means information,

12:08.604 --> 12:11.170
coded information,

12:11.433 --> 12:15.337
that’s the nearest you get, coded
information.

12:15.538 --> 12:19.477
First it is the Paravani, which you don’t
hear.

12:19.678 --> 12:25.903
When it rises from the Kundalini point –
means Mooladhara Chakra and Mooladhara,

12:26.104 --> 12:31.232
then it is not heard – there’s no sound.

12:31.589 --> 12:36.455
Then it comes to the stomach, the Paravani
starts.

12:38.840 --> 12:46.020
Then it comes into the centre, where, in
the heart, always you hear it – Madhyama -

12:46.196 --> 12:52.578
where you can hear it ‘Lub dub, Lub dub,
Lub dub’, just like heart,

12:53.189 --> 12:57.151
properly. With a stethoscope you can
hear it.

12:58.356 --> 13:02.329
Then it comes to Vishuddhi. It becomes
a witness,

13:02.513 --> 13:06.109
means ‘Pashyanti’, the One who Sees.

13:07.196 --> 13:09.737
Might have noticed yourself, when you are
caught up in Vishuddhi,

13:09.938 --> 13:16.185
you feel the thing going on here. But here
she sees.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.256
Then this sound, which is the sound with
which you speak,

13:24.705 --> 13:30.640
when it comes to the throat, it becomes
Vaikhari, is saying.

13:31.118 --> 13:35.917
This is even before the Kundalini’s there,
the Vani, the coded information,

13:36.118 --> 13:40.456
the language, which is first only coded,
becomes decoded here,

13:40.632 --> 13:43.165
she it called Vaikhari, which talks.

13:43.366 --> 13:48.240
But after realization, the Kundalini
enlightens the vani,

13:48.441 --> 13:51.205
as it enlightens everything else.

13:51.406 --> 13:58.311
Because of that enlightenment, your mantras
become enlightened.

13:58.950 --> 14:07.401
And that’s how, when you say a mantra,
it is effective, it’s lighted.

14:07.951 --> 14:13.646
Before this, any mantra said has no
meaning, it’s just ordinary Vani,

14:13.847 --> 14:16.594
just like in any ordinary person.

14:16.786 --> 14:22.285
So, it is called as the mantra which is
‘Jagrut’, awakened.

14:22.486 --> 14:26.964
So, a mantra which is Jagrut cannot be
created out of a mantra

14:27.165 --> 14:30.223
which is not enlightened.

14:33.428 --> 14:36.146
Like if you have, say, an earthen pot

14:36.347 --> 14:40.105
or an earthen thing like this, or this one
as it is,

14:40.306 --> 14:44.291
and you have all the oil and everything
there:

14:44.492 --> 14:49.053
still it won’t give light till it is
enlightened.

14:49.425 --> 14:54.499
In the same way, the mantra is nothing,
it’s just a dead pot.

14:54.700 --> 15:00.764
Unless and until it is enlightened by
Kundalini, it is from ordinary vani,

15:01.110 --> 15:04.679
which cannot give you enlightenment,
and which cannot give enlightenment

15:04.880 --> 15:10.302
to the mantras, and that’s why these
mantras have no meaning at all.

15:10.891 --> 15:14.810
A person whose Spirit is enlightened,

15:15.391 --> 15:21.522
and his vani is enlightened,

15:21.723 --> 15:27.176
such a person, whatever he says comes true.

15:27.567 --> 15:30.049
Whatever he asks for happens.

15:30.250 --> 15:37.701
Even before he says something, the desire,
the desire within us,

15:37.902 --> 15:44.057
which is the Paravani, which is the coded
information of the desire you have,

15:44.258 --> 15:47.512
becomes enlightened, and that’s how you
get the results.

15:47.713 --> 15:51.612
Suddenly you get something, you said:
"Oh, I have struck the jackpot,

15:51.813 --> 15:54.600
and Mother has done it".

15:55.601 --> 16:02.051
That’s how it works out. The whole system
works out this way, of Kundalini.

16:02.252 --> 16:07.254
So this pure Kundalini creates purity
within us.

16:07.455 --> 16:10.956
Without the purity we cannot see anything.
Anything that is impure -

16:11.157 --> 16:17.430
say, say my hands are not clean, I can’t
see the light.

16:17.631 --> 16:20.642
Anything that is dirtied, you cannot see
the real picture of it,

16:20.819 --> 16:25.290
you cannot see the reality if it is not
been purified.

16:25.491 --> 16:30.233
But, even if it is superficially purified
or artificially painted,

16:30.434 --> 16:34.387
still, you can always say that it is
artificially painted,

16:34.588 --> 16:39.586
and you cannot see the beauty of this one,
because this is done from outside.

16:39.787 --> 16:47.664
But this Kundalini burns off everything -
bhasmasat - makes everything into ashes,

16:48.737 --> 16:54.137
and whatever remains is the pure gold
of the Spirit within us.

16:56.863 --> 17:00.333
That’s why, when people try to raise
the Kundalini by wrong methods,

17:00.534 --> 17:05.984
she shows her temper. Actually, she never
gets angry.

17:06.185 --> 17:10.960
If Kundalini gets angry such a person can
never exist, is impossible,

17:11.161 --> 17:14.453
but doesn’t happen normally.

17:14.654 --> 17:20.463
But it is Shri Ganesha, which is the Deity
of Shri Kundalini, gets angry,

17:20.664 --> 17:27.242
and He creates this problem of heat.
Because she’s fire, and He’s the deity.

17:27.443 --> 17:34.155
So the fire of this Kundalini works out
in such a manner

17:34.356 --> 17:38.518
that your sympathetic nervous gets excited
with heat,

17:38.719 --> 17:43.079
and one may get even blisters and things,
if you try any tricks with Kundalini,

17:43.280 --> 17:46.841
any unholy behaviour... (inaudible words).

17:50.466 --> 17:56.225
The Urdhva-vati of Kundalini, the rising
of the Kundalini, is its nature.

17:56.426 --> 18:02.095
But when she goes and touches the Sahasrara,
that is an important point.

18:03.422 --> 18:08.084
If she does not touch the Sahasrara, then
the Grace doesn’t fall in,

18:08.252 --> 18:16.374
and the Grace has to come in within us on
our both sides of the Ida and Pingala Nadi.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.867
That’s how you feel relaxed.

18:20.068 --> 18:28.428
Now, how important it is for us to preserve
our being, before coming to realization.

18:28.629 --> 18:35.639
To preserve it as it is. But we do not
preserve. We make mistakes.

18:36.826 --> 18:41.191
Kundalini is not forgiveness, she does not
forgive you.

18:41.392 --> 18:48.117
She is not the one who can forgive, because
her nature is hot, like the fire.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.764
She cannot forgive. Only the Spirit can
forgive.

18:54.265 --> 18:59.200
Only the Atma can forgive, because she is
the one who indicates all your problems.

18:59.401 --> 19:04.415
She is the one who cleanses you. She has
to cleanse you.

19:04.616 --> 19:07.440
If she starts forgiving you, your dirt will
be left there.

19:07.641 --> 19:12.115
As we do, you see, we clean: “Oh, it cannot
be cleaned, leave it alone, what to do?”.

19:12.316 --> 19:16.950
She is not like that. If it is not clean,
she’ll burn.

19:19.079 --> 19:26.173
Cancer is the cause of neglect of Kundalini
awakening.

19:30.363 --> 19:36.008
Unless and until Kundalini is awakened,
you cannot cure cancer of any person.

19:36.820 --> 19:43.848
So, if somebody, say, has a nice
mother-in-law, she might be a relation,

19:44.049 --> 19:50.005
and she was a good lady, she also tried
to take vibrations and all that,

19:50.309 --> 19:53.997
she was quite aged, maybe she might be
also a seeker.

19:54.198 --> 19:58.818
But it acts best on seekers, because
the Kundalini has to be awakened

19:59.019 --> 20:02.245
and she will not be awakened unless
and until you have aspirations.

20:02.446 --> 20:06.425
And if you have no aspirations, if you just
try to get it for your curing,

20:06.626 --> 20:12.325
you might get cured, by her awakening,
but it’s a very forced action.

20:12.526 --> 20:16.238
It’s not so natural, there’s no suction
about it.

20:19.342 --> 20:23.198
We can say like that, supposing in this
room we light fire,

20:23.399 --> 20:26.750
there is no oxygen, it won’t live.

20:27.337 --> 20:32.216
So we have to have that oxygen within us
of our aspirations.

20:32.417 --> 20:38.550
If that atmosphere doesn’t exist,
Kundalini takes time to rise.

20:38.750 --> 20:44.829
Unless and until you are realized you
cannot keep Kundalini up there.

20:46.422 --> 20:49.342
You may just touch it, go down, again
you’ll touch it, go down,

20:49.543 --> 20:52.761
again you’ll touch it, go down.
So, as a result of this,

20:52.962 --> 20:56.582
some people start feeling the guilt.

20:56.783 --> 21:02.066
‘Why should I have done this? I should not
have done that’, and all that.

21:03.118 --> 21:08.281
But after realization, this guilt is
a big problem.

21:08.482 --> 21:11.729
Even before realization, I find, it is.

21:11.906 --> 21:17.754
Because guilt is an escape, where all
the things are accumulated,

21:18.574 --> 21:24.084
which have to be burned off. You see,
all things accumulate on the side,

21:24.285 --> 21:29.049
very nicely stored - stored away you see,
kept there nicely,

21:29.250 --> 21:33.544
so they do not face the Kundalini and get
burnt.

21:34.348 --> 21:37.521
And that’s how the left side of a person

21:37.722 --> 21:42.031
goes on recurring all the time,
all the time, through these two points

21:42.232 --> 21:47.740
of left Nabhi and left Vishuddhi.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.646
Allow the Kundalini to burn it off.

21:53.647 --> 21:59.412
Just put this to the fire.

22:00.430 --> 22:05.828
And when you put this to fire of Kundalini
it will burn off completely.

22:06.029 --> 22:10.206
Don’t build up any kind of guilt. At least
after realization.

22:10.407 --> 22:14.740
Before realization, of course, one has
to worry a little bit.

22:18.054 --> 22:23.541
But, even telling all this, it is convenient
to feel guilty.

22:23.742 --> 22:27.628
You avoid all problems by feeling guilty,
‘Oh, I should not have done it, I’m sorry’

22:27.829 --> 22:30.636
- English language.

22:31.193 --> 22:33.654
Very simple -‘I’m sorry, I should not have
done.

22:33.855 --> 22:36.480
I’m sorry. I tell you I’ve done a mistake,
all right’.

22:36.681 --> 22:40.789
But you do not say like this, that:
‘Alright, I’m sorry, forget it.’

22:40.990 --> 22:44.041
That should be added, too.

22:44.622 --> 22:47.714
You see, when you say somebody ‘I’m sorry’
to somebody,

22:47.915 --> 22:51.893
he’ll say: ‘Alright, forget it’. The other
person also should say within you,

22:52.094 --> 22:55.204
that ‘Forget it’. If you do not do, try
that thing,

22:55.405 --> 22:58.617
you see, this is very nicely accumulated
here all the time,

22:58.818 --> 23:02.186
and this feeling guilty is a very
convenient method

23:02.387 --> 23:06.221
of escaping the truth, you see, showing
that you are very frightened,

23:06.422 --> 23:08.981
you are very upset, this and that,

23:09.182 --> 23:11.733
and just storing up the whole thing up here
in the left Vishuddhi.

23:11.934 --> 23:16.058
How will you progress? You cannot progress

23:16.259 --> 23:21.647
with this idea that you are guilty, you are
- even if you are,

23:21.848 --> 23:24.684
what are you going to do, what? You want
to go to jail?

23:24.885 --> 23:28.146
Take two running jumps and go there!

23:28.918 --> 23:31.173
I would say like that. Why come to Sahaj
Yog?

23:31.374 --> 23:34.695
Just go to hell, you can go very fast,
there’s no need.

23:34.896 --> 23:39.671
But, if you are to be saved, accept that
you are saved,

23:39.848 --> 23:43.541
and do not build up these left Vishuddhi
problems.

23:43.742 --> 23:50.228
It’s a bit too much now. I think it’s high
time that we should burn,

23:51.635 --> 23:56.453
burn all these things, these guilts,

23:57.629 --> 24:04.313
these wrong ideas which always keeps us
down.

24:04.514 --> 24:08.330
It’s like putting something in the neck,
a heavy stone,

24:08.531 --> 24:12.889
and saying. ‘I can’t cure, what to do’.
Now, the stone must be removed,

24:13.090 --> 24:15.023
how can Mataji pull you out?

24:15.224 --> 24:21.750
See, whatever I may try, there’s a big
stone and that’s pulling you down.

24:22.699 --> 24:26.843
It’s a very big problem, I think now,

24:27.044 --> 24:31.932
because Kundalini doesn’t know what to do,
and how to reach your left Vishuddhi,

24:32.133 --> 24:35.760
to burn out that nonsensical thing which
you have stored very sweetly:

24:35.961 --> 24:41.306
‘Ah, I’m frightened, I’m afraid,
I’m sorry’.

24:41.935 --> 24:46.272
In Sahaj Yoga, certain few English language
usages are not allowed –

24:46.473 --> 24:49.223
one of these ‘I am afraid’.

24:49.661 --> 24:52.744
Even a politician who is so dominating
will say ‘I’m afraid’.

24:52.945 --> 24:56.862
I mean, what are you afraid of? Everybody
is afraid of you.

24:57.063 --> 25:02.871
What is there to be afraid of? So this
usage is not allowed, ‘I’m afraid’.

25:03.072 --> 25:07.503
This is not allowed at all, to say ‘I’m
afraid’. What are you afraid of?

25:07.704 --> 25:13.025
As I said today that ‘Wages of sin is
fear’.

25:13.251 --> 25:16.097
Alright. But wages of sin is fear,

25:16.298 --> 25:21.064
so, if the sin is removed, then the fear
should go or not?

25:22.439 --> 25:25.104
But still, it is like this, there is light,

25:25.305 --> 25:28.935
still you behave as if you, you are
in the dark, still you:

25:29.136 --> 25:35.165
‘I can’t see, I’m frightened’. Arey Baba,
there is light, see for yourself!

25:38.373 --> 25:41.698
This is a thing one should know, that your
Kundalini is awakened,

25:41.899 --> 25:45.466
that your Spirit is shining. Open your
heart to this,

25:45.667 --> 25:48.570
accept this, recognize it,

25:48.771 --> 25:53.248
know that you are a realized soul now, and
that Kundalini has purified you.

25:53.449 --> 25:57.151
Now, please do not accumulate this dirt
here, on the left side,

25:57.365 --> 26:01.340
because you like it, because it’s very
convenient to put up faces,

26:01.541 --> 26:04.304
to say ‘Oh, it’s alright’.

26:04.536 --> 26:07.765
Little bit heat coming up, send it up here,
goes like that.

26:07.966 --> 26:12.865
It will be cleaned out. Leave it alone.
Let us face it.

26:15.050 --> 26:18.654
Somebody gets a little heat, ‘Oh, I’m again
bad, again I’m lost,

26:18.855 --> 26:22.440
God knows what have I done?’

26:25.926 --> 26:29.264
Correct? It happens, very commonly.

26:29.465 --> 26:32.804
I find suddenly people...

26:36.164 --> 26:39.527
without My saying anything. Just imagine!

26:39.728 --> 26:43.256
“Good morning, good morning!”
”Good morning….”

26:44.622 --> 26:48.615
“What’s the matter?” “It’s very hot…”.

26:50.189 --> 26:54.108
Is this the way to greet your Mother?

26:55.682 --> 26:59.094
You are the soldiers, you are the warriors.

26:59.779 --> 27:05.680
But, what I find, hands are shaking.
Where should I put these swords?

27:09.943 --> 27:12.348
This is My experience now,

27:12.549 --> 27:17.360
that this pouch of the left Vishuddhi is
a very difficult thing.

27:17.561 --> 27:22.158
My ears are also becoming absolutely
clogged with that vibrations,

27:22.359 --> 27:24.657
so much flowing on the left side, all this
left Vishuddhi,

27:24.858 --> 27:27.592
that I can’t hear from the left side.

27:27.816 --> 27:32.976
So, at least have some pity on Me, and
give up that nonsense of guilt.

27:33.177 --> 27:37.343
Even a minute you feel guilty, just look at
outside and look at the birds chirping,

27:37.544 --> 27:40.433
look at the sunshine, look at the beautiful
Nature

27:40.634 --> 27:44.255
that has given you such a beautiful color
and all that. Look at that,

27:44.456 --> 27:47.273
and just take the beauty within yourself
and without.

27:47.474 --> 27:51.421
Enjoy, and give up this miserable look.

27:51.622 --> 27:58.673
You should at least look like realized
people. Look, at least, if not feel.

28:02.009 --> 28:06.494
So, this kind of seriousness has no meaning
in Sahaja Yoga.

28:06.695 --> 28:14.443
A Sahaj Yogi stands like this, and talks
like this, and walks like this - normally.

28:18.326 --> 28:25.817
So, feeling guilty is not only speciality
of English,

28:26.018 --> 28:28.899
but I have seen it with all the Western
people have this

28:29.100 --> 28:33.503
very good idea of feeling guilty, everybody
is so.

28:34.569 --> 28:36.414
Went to France – I told you about French
people.

28:36.615 --> 28:39.072
As soon as I went there, they warned Me
for one thing,

28:39.248 --> 28:43.652
that, “Mother, never say You are the happy
person, You are very happy people”.

28:43.878 --> 28:48.170
I said: ‘Why? Because I’m - I am a happy
person, why should I tell them lies?”.

28:48.371 --> 28:50.784
Said they will never believe Me, and
they’ll think You are absolutely

28:50.985 --> 28:54.175
ignorant of the Truth, You are ignorant
of the reality,

28:54.376 --> 28:57.198
and that You are an uneducated person.

28:57.399 --> 29:01.850
You have not read books on ‘shocks
for future’ and things like that.

29:04.514 --> 29:10.131
I said: ‘All right’. But then I really
lashed all the French on that,

29:10.307 --> 29:13.256
and they laughed and laughed at themselves.

29:13.457 --> 29:16.694
‘Les Miserables’, I said, ‘you people,
everybody is miserable because of you’.

29:16.895 --> 29:20.005
Any Frenchman coming anywhere, the people
don’t know where to sit,

29:20.206 --> 29:23.381
they don’t know this camel, which side
it is going to sit,

29:23.582 --> 29:27.672
on whose head it is going to sit, and
the camel is very miserable.

29:27.873 --> 29:31.321
And here everybody is frightened
of the camel, how he is going to behave.

29:31.522 --> 29:34.435
Very difficult person if he’s French.

29:34.636 --> 29:38.793
Everywhere internationally they are known
to be difficult.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.467
And now, here you are, what are you
miserable about?

29:41.668 --> 29:44.727
And English have taken certain qualities
from Americans,

29:44.928 --> 29:48.298
which they need not have taken, and some
from French.

29:48.499 --> 29:52.544
They don’t understand their quality of mind
is the best.

29:52.745 --> 29:54.801
They have taken from here and there,

29:55.002 --> 29:58.377
and that’s how they are also becoming
French you see.

29:58.578 --> 30:02.840
Bathroom culture, that’s what it is.

30:03.041 --> 30:05.367
And you don’t have to learn anything from
them.

30:05.568 --> 30:09.321
It is they, they are who have to learn from
you. What have they got?

30:09.522 --> 30:12.331
Have they got any scholars?

30:12.818 --> 30:15.001
Very few.

30:15.646 --> 30:21.533
And you, your this weakness for becoming
miserable, and guilty, and all that,

30:21.734 --> 30:27.294
is coming from where? I really can’t
understand, what is there to be miserable?

30:27.495 --> 30:30.574
If you don’t have a job, you get a dole.
Nowhere in the world people get doles.

30:30.775 --> 30:37.986
Do you know that? Nowhere!
Nowhere people get doles.

30:38.187 --> 30:42.516
While you get your doles quite all right,
it will mean... you don’t starve.

30:42.858 --> 30:48.159
Germany, France, anywhere, you don’t get
a good dole.

30:50.172 --> 30:54.542
So what is there to be miserable? At least
you people be happy people.

30:54.743 --> 31:00.458
At least the English should show the way.
Feel happy within yourself.

31:00.659 --> 31:04.168
Then only you’ll be able to see the Spirit.

31:04.369 --> 31:08.432
Don’t be miserable. There’s nothing to be
miserable.

31:08.633 --> 31:13.463
We are special people, who have got
the blessings of our Spirit.

31:13.664 --> 31:20.417
We should all sing, laugh, enjoy, be
[sprinkling? Indistinct] with vitality.

31:20.618 --> 31:22.626
There’s nothing to feel miserable.

31:22.827 --> 31:27.580
I mean, after some time you’ll find really
ou’ll have to act to be miserable.

31:27.781 --> 31:33.057
It will be difficult for you to be miserable
for more than five minutes.

31:33.258 --> 31:37.564
I can bet on that. With Me, same problem.
I find it impossible, you see.

31:37.765 --> 31:41.160
I try to be very serious: ‘I’m going to
now say something serious’ -

31:41.361 --> 31:45.532
suddenly I burst out laughing, because
to Me the whole thing is nothing

31:45.733 --> 31:48.377
but a big joke on.

31:48.678 --> 31:51.622
So don’t have these French ideas in your
head of becoming miserable

31:51.823 --> 31:57.643
for nothing at all. Be a happy people. Emit
happiness, joy to others.

31:57.844 --> 32:03.511
There’s nothing like ‘future shock’,
for you at least.

32:03.712 --> 32:11.498
There’s nothing like future problems.
Future is beautiful, just you have no idea.

32:11.699 --> 32:18.240
But do not lag behind with a big stone
tied to your necks.

32:19.035 --> 32:23.319
For people who know that they have found
the Spirit,

32:23.520 --> 32:27.135
they should know that they have found
the joy.

32:27.336 --> 32:32.347
Spirit is the source of joy, and that
should be evident when you talk.

32:32.548 --> 32:38.179
No inhibitions, no curbing, it’s complete
freedom.

32:38.931 --> 32:43.951
But do not try to mold yourself into the
molds of the people who are not realized.

32:44.152 --> 32:48.363
Now you are different, you are changed,
it is irreversible.

32:48.564 --> 32:50.998
Whatever you may try, say after two years
or three years,

32:51.199 --> 32:55.601
all of you will be bubbling with laughter.
But why not do it now?

32:56.016 --> 33:00.196
If it is going to happen later, why not
have the blossom time now?

33:00.397 --> 33:04.222
We start thinking about it, we start
worrying about it,

33:04.423 --> 33:07.004
there’s nothing like that.

33:07.205 --> 33:11.826
Our problems are solved, our lives are
beautified,

33:12.027 --> 33:16.078
everything is so nice and good, just
to make you happy.

33:16.279 --> 33:20.564
Still if you are not happy, still if you
are worried,

33:20.765 --> 33:25.154
then the Divine recedes, it recedes.

33:25.355 --> 33:32.684
It’s like sunshine. If you do not want
to face the sunshine, you do not get it.

33:32.885 --> 33:37.087
You have to face the sunshine. You just
don’t get it.

33:37.288 --> 33:42.722
Every tree moves to the sunshine, every
leaf tries to be towards the sunshine.

33:42.923 --> 33:48.592
They have innately built wisdom,
in the same way you should be,

33:48.888 --> 33:52.553
and you will see that with this – your life
will change completely.

33:52.754 --> 33:58.382
Every moment you’ll enjoy. Every minute
of life you’ll enjoy.

33:58.690 --> 34:04.019
Everything that you do you’ll enjoy. Every
small thing you do you’ll enjoy.

34:07.325 --> 34:12.461
People are sometimes amazed with Me, also.
Once I climbed up a place called Palitana

34:12.662 --> 34:17.404
which is about seven miles one has to walk,
with My son-in-law, daughter,

34:17.605 --> 34:20.252
and they said: ‘If You cannot go up You’d
better sit on those palanquins

34:20.522 --> 34:23.500
and all that’. ‘No, no’ - I said - ‘I can
walk, let’s go, I’ll walk’.

34:23.701 --> 34:26.582
And I was just enjoying, you know, I never
felt I was walking on a thing like that,

34:26.783 --> 34:29.002
because I was enjoying the Nature, I was
enjoying the people,

34:29.203 --> 34:32.311
how they were coming down, and how
the people were going up and all that,

34:32.512 --> 34:35.041
and their gaits and things, and I was just
enjoying all that.

34:35.203 --> 34:38.601
And when we reached there, these people
who were going with Me,

34:38.802 --> 34:42.191
absolutely fagged out and tired, they sat
down: ‘Haaaa’.

34:42.392 --> 34:45.945
And I also sat down with them, I looked up,
I said: ‘Look at these –

34:46.146 --> 34:50.995
so many elephants of - they made, and
everybody’s tail is differently twisted.

34:51.196 --> 34:54.438
How they must have thought of so many
permutations and combinations?’.

34:54.639 --> 34:59.130
My son-in-law said: ‘How could You see
the tail of an elephant

34:59.331 --> 35:02.473
when we are so very tired here?’.

35:02.674 --> 35:05.526
You see, I just - spontaneously I saw
the thing,

35:05.727 --> 35:09.888
I said: ‘How surprising that they have
twisted the tail of the elephants’ –

35:10.089 --> 35:13.327
there were many elephants created, you
see, at least there must be about

35:13.528 --> 35:16.991
hundred elephants in that pattern,
everybody’s tail was twisted differently.

35:17.192 --> 35:20.737
I said: ‘It’s so, I mean, imagine, one
hundred elephants with twisted tails

35:20.938 --> 35:23.821
in different ways, hundred ways. It’s
remarkable for Me’.

35:24.022 --> 35:29.376
They said: “How could you see the tail?
We are so tired, we want some water!”.

35:30.886 --> 35:37.007
That’s what it is. This is inexhaustible.
This power of enjoyment is inexhaustible.

35:37.208 --> 35:42.506
I want you all to enjoy that, to drink that
nectar of your Spirit,

35:42.707 --> 35:46.431
and to forget about all these artificial
problems that you have.

35:46.632 --> 35:51.534
You just enjoy, because now you are
drenched in your Spirit. So enjoy that.

35:51.735 --> 35:56.362
Why worry? Some people haven’t got it,
they will get it also.

35:56.563 --> 35:59.697
Don’t worry about anyone, they will all
get it, they will all have to get it,

35:59.898 --> 36:04.502
all those who are seekers will have
to come. It’s nice you have come earlier,

36:04.703 --> 36:10.682
it’s a nice thing, but now do not stop
your progress by

36:12.009 --> 36:17.333
lingering with this load around your neck.

36:17.534 --> 36:22.096
Let the Kundalini take you up. But she
likes light things -

36:22.297 --> 36:25.867
she’s a light thing herself, that’s why
she rises.

36:26.068 --> 36:28.219
Everything that is heavy within you she’ll
burn,

36:28.420 --> 36:31.855
but do not make yourself additionally
heavy.

36:32.056 --> 36:34.411
May God Bless you.

36:45.607 --> 36:49.838
I’ll have some water please. You brought
this gentleman (a statue) here?

36:50.039 --> 36:53.119
You brought him? [Yogi: “Yes, Mother”]
Ah ha.

36:53.320 --> 36:57.506
[Yogi: “Is it the correct place in the
temple…?”] Anywhere, it’s great, you know.

36:57.707 --> 37:00.138
Some thieves came into our house.

37:00.339 --> 37:04.368
And this heavy gentleman had come from
India. He was very vibrated.

37:04.569 --> 37:08.025
And the thieves came with some silver put
in the dining room.

37:08.226 --> 37:12.437
They had collected all the silver, put it
on a tablecloth,

37:12.638 --> 37:16.043
and put the whole thing on the dining room.

37:16.244 --> 37:21.956
And then suddenly God knows what happened.
They just ran away, leaving that there.

37:22.157 --> 37:26.597
And this gentleman was there,
in the passage. They just ran away.

37:26.798 --> 37:29.952
Can you imagine, these thieves - I mean
they are burglars,

37:30.153 --> 37:32.400
competent absolutely, experts -

37:32.601 --> 37:37.818
nobody could believe it, except that we saw
some steps and our door was opened out.

37:38.019 --> 37:40.789
Otherwise nobody could believe it.
Not here, Oxted.

37:40.990 --> 37:44.443
But they did not take even a spoon.

37:46.358 --> 37:49.209
God knows what happened.

37:57.081 --> 37:59.920
I was not there.

38:02.293 --> 38:06.427
Recently brought from India. You see,
poor - were very hefty people

38:06.628 --> 38:12.758
who brought our luggage - do, leave it
there - and they brought this one.

38:12.959 --> 38:16.172
She said: “This is a very heavy gentleman
from India”.

38:16.373 --> 38:21.958
They were both hot and exhausted, but
their Kundalini had risen up.

38:22.159 --> 38:24.816
This is Kartikeya.

38:27.556 --> 38:32.167
Hmmm! This is the fire of Christ.

38:32.693 --> 38:36.502
This is the one that is going to come.
Really. The fire of Christ.

38:36.703 --> 38:43.118
The destroying power, Rudras. This is one
of the Rudras of Christ.

38:47.771 --> 38:52.333
Hmm, it’s quite warm, I think.

39:02.811 --> 39:07.780
Kundalini is working it out. She is rising.

39:17.405 --> 39:23.198
How are you here? [Somebody says: “Fine”]
Alright? Alison? Hm.

39:23.399 --> 39:26.410
Come, come.

39:26.611 --> 39:30.642
I would like to see all the children
on My feet today.
