00:00:01.444 --> 00:00:05.060
Today I told you about Kundalini,

00:00:05.261 --> 00:00:12.593
and that Kundalini is the Pure Desire
within us,

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:22.018
that manifests or is awakened

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.483
to give us our Self-realization.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.178
Means the desire is only fulfilled when
you get your Self-realization,

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.943
otherwise it is not manifested – it is just
dormant;

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.825
it is still residual. It has created
the whole universe,

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:56.679
but until and unless you get
Self-realization,

00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:03.816
unless and until you become one with
your Spirit,

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:10.026
you have not achieved the manifestation
of this power,

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:15.322
which will go on making you run and run
and run,

00:01:15.523 --> 00:01:19.832
thinking that you have not yet achieved,
or you have not found out your meaning.

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.771
It will be there, all the time, sleeping,

00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:28.878
but giving you a feeling of vacuum,
you see.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.381
So this power must be made to manifest,

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:37.684
but when it manifests…

00:01:38.468 --> 00:01:43.184
[Shri Mataji pauses to comfort an
infant: “What’s it? What happened?

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:47.587
Well, let it be, let him sit down, come.
What happened? Come along.

00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:52.248
What’s happening? Eh? It’s alright."

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:58.946
(Shri Mataji kisses the child) “Alright.
Alright?” (The baby: “Yes”) “Good.

00:02:06.818 --> 00:02:13.327
Now one has to keep quiet, alright?”
(Shri Mataji kisses the child.)]

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.755
Then, this power has got certain qualities.

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:27.433
The first quality it has got, this is
ungrahavati,

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:32.736
means it goes against the gravity.

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:40.629
It goes against the gravity. You see,
a thing rises,

00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:44.228
it doesn’t go down.

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:51.749
So a person who has to be aspiring
by nature.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.172
If a person is not aspiring type
the Kundalini doesn’t rise.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.184
Because, like, you see that, when food
passes down our stomach

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:09.014
it presses the sides of the intestines.

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:14.358
By that these movements of going down
takes place. Do you see my point?

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:20.761
So when the Kundalini starts, and starts
pressing on the sides of the chakras,

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:25.905
she creates a feeling of throwing it higher
and higher,

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:29.680
so the chakras bounce it upward.

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:36.614
All the heavy things,

00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:43.431
all go downward,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.979
but the Kundalini rises higher and higher
and higher, because it is like fire.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.632
Fire never burns downward. It always
burns upward.

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:09.084
She looks also like fire, and she has
the capacity of fire within her.

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:21.368
The fire has a capacity to purify, and to
burn off whatever can be burnt off.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.537
It purifies the things which it cannot
burn,

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:29.709
and burns off the things which are
inflammable, which can be burnt out.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.378
[Aside: “Come along, come forward”.
Man: “Thank you very much”.]

00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:50.611
So, the quality of fire that exists
in the Kundalini

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:57.770
burns off whatever is useless.

00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:03.255
Like in our house we find all the useless
things, and we take them in the garden

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:07.854
and burn them off, finished – once for all
they are finished.

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:12.036
So when the Kundalini rises, she also burns
off all useless things that you have,

00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:18.938
all your useless desires, your useless
ideas of action,

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:25.828
all sorts of useless accumulation
of feelings and egos,

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.288
and every sort of a nonsensical thing that
is in between.

00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:33.051
Everything is burnt off fast, because they
can be burnt,

00:05:33.252 --> 00:05:39.502
they are not eternal by nature. They are
not eternal by nature.

00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:45.625
They are temporarily there. All that is
temporary, she burns off,

00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:53.666
and that’s how she enlightens the Spirit,
because Spirit cannot be burnt by anything.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:06:03.501
But this burning is so beautiful that it
burns off all that is bad, stagnating,

00:06:03.702 --> 00:06:08.918
all that is polluting, all that is
a disease,

00:06:09.586 --> 00:06:12.767
and cools down the system.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:22.163
It is very interesting to see how this
power of fire becomes the cool breeze,

00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:26.938
but in the science also you find that
electricity can give you

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.431
hot breeze or cool breeze.

00:06:30.972 --> 00:06:33.647
You can transform from one to another,

00:06:33.848 --> 00:06:37.675
but there is no ultimate for these things,
they are always reversible.

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:41.723
Supposing something becomes a magnetism,
you can always convert into electricity,

00:06:41.924 --> 00:06:45.229
electricity can always be converted
into magnetism.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.003
But Kundalini is such a thing that once
she burns off

00:06:50.204 --> 00:06:56.406
everything that is there, that’s how you
get heat, because she’s burning.

00:06:56.607 --> 00:07:03.308
But when she cools down and becomes cool
then she is not reversible.

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:09.969
That’s why it is a living process. Living
process is never reversible.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.876
All dead processes can be reversible,

00:07:13.077 --> 00:07:16.288
but anything that is reversible – now,
supposing you are grown up:

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.321
you cannot become a little baby. Whatever
you may try -

00:07:20.522 --> 00:07:25.461
you may have any number of operations -
you cannot become that.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:32.047
Now you are grown up, now you are modern,
over-developed.

00:07:32.248 --> 00:07:35.543
You may try anything to become a primitive
person – you cannot.

00:07:35.744 --> 00:07:41.897
You just cannot, whatever you may try.
That will be all very artificial.

00:07:43.303 --> 00:07:47.212
You may just feel that you have become
primitive by wearing some sort of a dress,

00:07:47.413 --> 00:07:51.751
by feeling that, ‘Oh, now there’s no
modernism in us, and now we have become

00:07:51.952 --> 00:07:55.228
very, very subdued’, nothing of the kind.

00:07:56.396 --> 00:08:03.465
It is curable, but not reversible. But,
it’s a living process.

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:12.327
So, Kundalini within us expedites the
living process within us of our evolution.

00:08:14.608 --> 00:08:21.658
So the power of Kundalini is to purify,
she purifies us like fire.

00:08:25.937 --> 00:08:31.403
She doesn’t purify us like water, it’s
surprising,

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:36.977
she doesn’t purify us like water. Now,
water, what does the water do?

00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:44.456
Water never burns off anything, but
it dissolves certain things.

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.889
It can take in something within itself,
you see?

00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:51.093
It can contain some of the dirt within
itself.

00:08:51.294 --> 00:08:55.076
Supposing you put a color in the water –
it assumes the color.

00:08:55.277 --> 00:08:58.861
But Kundalini does not assume the color.

00:08:59.482 --> 00:09:03.515
She burns off. Do you follow My point?

00:09:03.716 --> 00:09:08.656
So, if you have anything wrong within you,
she’ll burn it off,

00:09:08.857 --> 00:09:12.431
but she’ll not absorb – she’s pure.

00:09:14.623 --> 00:09:17.434
She cannot absorb

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:25.601
those things into her that will pollute her.
She cannot be polluted.

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:33.959
This quality of fire -

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.090
say for example, if you put gold in fire,
silver in fire, you can purify these things.

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:43.484
Their pure form comes in… That’s how
you know.

00:09:43.653 --> 00:09:49.010
But if you put gold and fire in water,
nothing will happen.

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:55.265
At the most you can wash them from outside.
But in and out you cannot do it.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:02.850
So outwardly you can do with other things,
but with Kundalini you do in and out.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.437
The face also looks beautiful,

00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:15.713
as if some glazing has taken place
on the face, a new, bright face.

00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:23.784
It’s not sallow, neither it is horribly
burning,

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:28.860
nor is it pale and ugly-looking,

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:36.646
but it becomes radiant. Radiance, that’s
what Kundalini gives you.

00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:45.136
It looks also, as if a molten

00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:49.117
iron, you see - have you seen molten
iron? –

00:10:49.318 --> 00:10:56.290
Pillar of – supposing you take a pillar
of iron and, and heat it,

00:10:56.491 --> 00:11:01.245
to a point where it starts showing,
you see, copper, every color in it,

00:11:02.063 --> 00:11:05.487
copperish and all sorts of color you see,
see it’s golden, copperish and all that,

00:11:05.688 --> 00:11:10.171
you see, like a furnace. But very silently,

00:11:11.693 --> 00:11:15.691
very silent, it works out.

00:11:17.084 --> 00:11:19.640
Now, the sound of Kundalini

00:11:19.841 --> 00:11:23.680
I have told you in one of My lectures,
how it creates sound.

00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:30.814
For example at Vishuddhi, it creates
the sound of all the vowels

00:11:31.409 --> 00:11:35.253
that are in Sanskrit language. The English
vowels are very few.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:42.674
Sanskrit language are a aa – i ii – u uu –
ru ruu – lru lruu –

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:50.210
e aì – o aù – am ah. These are the sounds
at Vishuddhi we can say.

00:11:51.152 --> 00:11:55.543
But she creates sounds on all the chakras,

00:11:55.781 --> 00:12:03.086
but when she comes to Nabhi it becomes
a vani.

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:07.181
Vani means information,

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:11.170
coded information,

00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:15.337
that’s the nearest you get, coded
information.

00:12:15.538 --> 00:12:19.477
First it is the Paravani, which you don’t
hear.

00:12:19.678 --> 00:12:25.903
When it rises from the Kundalini point –
means Mooladhara Chakra and Mooladhara,

00:12:26.104 --> 00:12:31.232
then it is not heard – there’s no sound.

00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:36.455
Then it comes to the stomach, the Paravani
starts.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:46.020
Then it comes into the centre, where, in
the heart, always you hear it – Madhyama -

00:12:46.196 --> 00:12:52.578
where you can hear it ‘Lub dub, Lub dub,
Lub dub’, just like heart,

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:57.151
properly. With a stethoscope you can
hear it.

00:12:58.356 --> 00:13:02.329
Then it comes to Vishuddhi. It becomes
a witness,

00:13:02.513 --> 00:13:06.109
means ‘Pashyanti’, the One who Sees.

00:13:07.196 --> 00:13:09.737
Might have noticed yourself, when you are
caught up in Vishuddhi,

00:13:09.938 --> 00:13:16.185
you feel the thing going on here. But here
she sees.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.256
Then this sound, which is the sound with
which you speak,

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:30.640
when it comes to the throat, it becomes
Vaikhari, is saying.

00:13:31.118 --> 00:13:35.917
This is even before the Kundalini’s there,
the Vani, the coded information,

00:13:36.118 --> 00:13:40.456
the language, which is first only coded,
becomes decoded here,

00:13:40.632 --> 00:13:43.165
she it called Vaikhari, which talks.

00:13:43.366 --> 00:13:48.240
But after realization, the Kundalini
enlightens the vani,

00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:51.205
as it enlightens everything else.

00:13:51.406 --> 00:13:58.311
Because of that enlightenment, your mantras
become enlightened.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:07.401
And that’s how, when you say a mantra,
it is effective, it’s lighted.

00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:13.646
Before this, any mantra said has no
meaning, it’s just ordinary Vani,

00:14:13.847 --> 00:14:16.594
just like in any ordinary person.

00:14:16.786 --> 00:14:22.285
So, it is called as the mantra which is
‘Jagrut’, awakened.

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:26.964
So, a mantra which is Jagrut cannot be
created out of a mantra

00:14:27.165 --> 00:14:30.223
which is not enlightened.

00:14:33.428 --> 00:14:36.146
Like if you have, say, an earthen pot

00:14:36.347 --> 00:14:40.105
or an earthen thing like this, or this one
as it is,

00:14:40.306 --> 00:14:44.291
and you have all the oil and everything
there:

00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:49.053
still it won’t give light till it is
enlightened.

00:14:49.425 --> 00:14:54.499
In the same way, the mantra is nothing,
it’s just a dead pot.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:00.764
Unless and until it is enlightened by
Kundalini, it is from ordinary vani,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.679
which cannot give you enlightenment,
and which cannot give enlightenment

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.302
to the mantras, and that’s why these
mantras have no meaning at all.

00:15:10.891 --> 00:15:14.810
A person whose Spirit is enlightened,

00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:21.522
and his vani is enlightened,

00:15:21.723 --> 00:15:27.176
such a person, whatever he says comes true.

00:15:27.567 --> 00:15:30.049
Whatever he asks for happens.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:37.701
Even before he says something, the desire,
the desire within us,

00:15:37.902 --> 00:15:44.057
which is the Paravani, which is the coded
information of the desire you have,

00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:47.512
becomes enlightened, and that’s how you
get the results.

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:51.612
Suddenly you get something, you said:
"Oh, I have struck the jackpot,

00:15:51.813 --> 00:15:54.600
and Mother has done it".

00:15:55.601 --> 00:16:02.051
That’s how it works out. The whole system
works out this way, of Kundalini.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:07.254
So this pure Kundalini creates purity
within us.

00:16:07.455 --> 00:16:10.956
Without the purity we cannot see anything.
Anything that is impure -

00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:17.430
say, say my hands are not clean, I can’t
see the light.

00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:20.642
Anything that is dirtied, you cannot see
the real picture of it,

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:25.290
you cannot see the reality if it is not
been purified.

00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:30.233
But, even if it is superficially purified
or artificially painted,

00:16:30.434 --> 00:16:34.387
still, you can always say that it is
artificially painted,

00:16:34.588 --> 00:16:39.586
and you cannot see the beauty of this one,
because this is done from outside.

00:16:39.787 --> 00:16:47.664
But this Kundalini burns off everything -
bhasmasat - makes everything into ashes,

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:54.137
and whatever remains is the pure gold
of the Spirit within us.

00:16:56.863 --> 00:17:00.333
That’s why, when people try to raise
the Kundalini by wrong methods,

00:17:00.534 --> 00:17:05.984
she shows her temper. Actually, she never
gets angry.

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:10.960
If Kundalini gets angry such a person can
never exist, is impossible,

00:17:11.161 --> 00:17:14.453
but doesn’t happen normally.

00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:20.463
But it is Shri Ganesha, which is the Deity
of Shri Kundalini, gets angry,

00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:27.242
and He creates this problem of heat.
Because she’s fire, and He’s the deity.

00:17:27.443 --> 00:17:34.155
So the fire of this Kundalini works out
in such a manner

00:17:34.356 --> 00:17:38.518
that your sympathetic nervous gets excited
with heat,

00:17:38.719 --> 00:17:43.079
and one may get even blisters and things,
if you try any tricks with Kundalini,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.841
any unholy behaviour... (inaudible words).

00:17:50.466 --> 00:17:56.225
The Urdhva-vati of Kundalini, the rising
of the Kundalini, is its nature.

00:17:56.426 --> 00:18:02.095
But when she goes and touches the Sahasrara,
that is an important point.

00:18:03.422 --> 00:18:08.084
If she does not touch the Sahasrara, then
the Grace doesn’t fall in,

00:18:08.252 --> 00:18:16.374
and the Grace has to come in within us on
our both sides of the Ida and Pingala Nadi.

00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:19.867
That’s how you feel relaxed.

00:18:20.068 --> 00:18:28.428
Now, how important it is for us to preserve
our being, before coming to realization.

00:18:28.629 --> 00:18:35.639
To preserve it as it is. But we do not
preserve. We make mistakes.

00:18:36.826 --> 00:18:41.191
Kundalini is not forgiveness, she does not
forgive you.

00:18:41.392 --> 00:18:48.117
She is not the one who can forgive, because
her nature is hot, like the fire.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.764
She cannot forgive. Only the Spirit can
forgive.

00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:59.200
Only the Atma can forgive, because she is
the one who indicates all your problems.

00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:04.415
She is the one who cleanses you. She has
to cleanse you.

00:19:04.616 --> 00:19:07.440
If she starts forgiving you, your dirt will
be left there.

00:19:07.641 --> 00:19:12.115
As we do, you see, we clean: “Oh, it cannot
be cleaned, leave it alone, what to do?”.

00:19:12.316 --> 00:19:16.950
She is not like that. If it is not clean,
she’ll burn.

00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:26.173
Cancer is the cause of neglect of Kundalini
awakening.

00:19:30.363 --> 00:19:36.008
Unless and until Kundalini is awakened,
you cannot cure cancer of any person.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:43.848
So, if somebody, say, has a nice
mother-in-law, she might be a relation,

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:50.005
and she was a good lady, she also tried
to take vibrations and all that,

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:53.997
she was quite aged, maybe she might be
also a seeker.

00:19:54.198 --> 00:19:58.818
But it acts best on seekers, because
the Kundalini has to be awakened

00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:02.245
and she will not be awakened unless
and until you have aspirations.

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:06.425
And if you have no aspirations, if you just
try to get it for your curing,

00:20:06.626 --> 00:20:12.325
you might get cured, by her awakening,
but it’s a very forced action.

00:20:12.526 --> 00:20:16.238
It’s not so natural, there’s no suction
about it.

00:20:19.342 --> 00:20:23.198
We can say like that, supposing in this
room we light fire,

00:20:23.399 --> 00:20:26.750
there is no oxygen, it won’t live.

00:20:27.337 --> 00:20:32.216
So we have to have that oxygen within us
of our aspirations.

00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:38.550
If that atmosphere doesn’t exist,
Kundalini takes time to rise.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:44.829
Unless and until you are realized you
cannot keep Kundalini up there.

00:20:46.422 --> 00:20:49.342
You may just touch it, go down, again
you’ll touch it, go down,

00:20:49.543 --> 00:20:52.761
again you’ll touch it, go down.
So, as a result of this,

00:20:52.962 --> 00:20:56.582
some people start feeling the guilt.

00:20:56.783 --> 00:21:02.066
‘Why should I have done this? I should not
have done that’, and all that.

00:21:03.118 --> 00:21:08.281
But after realization, this guilt is
a big problem.

00:21:08.482 --> 00:21:11.729
Even before realization, I find, it is.

00:21:11.906 --> 00:21:17.754
Because guilt is an escape, where all
the things are accumulated,

00:21:18.574 --> 00:21:24.084
which have to be burned off. You see,
all things accumulate on the side,

00:21:24.285 --> 00:21:29.049
very nicely stored - stored away you see,
kept there nicely,

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.544
so they do not face the Kundalini and get
burnt.

00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:37.521
And that’s how the left side of a person

00:21:37.722 --> 00:21:42.031
goes on recurring all the time,
all the time, through these two points

00:21:42.232 --> 00:21:47.740
of left Nabhi and left Vishuddhi.

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:51.646
Allow the Kundalini to burn it off.

00:21:53.647 --> 00:21:59.412
Just put this to the fire.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.828
And when you put this to fire of Kundalini
it will burn off completely.

00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:10.206
Don’t build up any kind of guilt. At least
after realization.

00:22:10.407 --> 00:22:14.740
Before realization, of course, one has
to worry a little bit.

00:22:18.054 --> 00:22:23.541
But, even telling all this, it is convenient
to feel guilty.

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:27.628
You avoid all problems by feeling guilty,
‘Oh, I should not have done it, I’m sorry’

00:22:27.829 --> 00:22:30.636
- English language.

00:22:31.193 --> 00:22:33.654
Very simple -‘I’m sorry, I should not have
done.

00:22:33.855 --> 00:22:36.480
I’m sorry. I tell you I’ve done a mistake,
all right’.

00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:40.789
But you do not say like this, that:
‘Alright, I’m sorry, forget it.’

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.041
That should be added, too.

00:22:44.622 --> 00:22:47.714
You see, when you say somebody ‘I’m sorry’
to somebody,

00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:51.893
he’ll say: ‘Alright, forget it’. The other
person also should say within you,

00:22:52.094 --> 00:22:55.204
that ‘Forget it’. If you do not do, try
that thing,

00:22:55.405 --> 00:22:58.617
you see, this is very nicely accumulated
here all the time,

00:22:58.818 --> 00:23:02.186
and this feeling guilty is a very
convenient method

00:23:02.387 --> 00:23:06.221
of escaping the truth, you see, showing
that you are very frightened,

00:23:06.422 --> 00:23:08.981
you are very upset, this and that,

00:23:09.182 --> 00:23:11.733
and just storing up the whole thing up here
in the left Vishuddhi.

00:23:11.934 --> 00:23:16.058
How will you progress? You cannot progress

00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:21.647
with this idea that you are guilty, you are
- even if you are,

00:23:21.848 --> 00:23:24.684
what are you going to do, what? You want
to go to jail?

00:23:24.885 --> 00:23:28.146
Take two running jumps and go there!

00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:31.173
I would say like that. Why come to Sahaj
Yog?

00:23:31.374 --> 00:23:34.695
Just go to hell, you can go very fast,
there’s no need.

00:23:34.896 --> 00:23:39.671
But, if you are to be saved, accept that
you are saved,

00:23:39.848 --> 00:23:43.541
and do not build up these left Vishuddhi
problems.

00:23:43.742 --> 00:23:50.228
It’s a bit too much now. I think it’s high
time that we should burn,

00:23:51.635 --> 00:23:56.453
burn all these things, these guilts,

00:23:57.629 --> 00:24:04.313
these wrong ideas which always keeps us
down.

00:24:04.514 --> 00:24:08.330
It’s like putting something in the neck,
a heavy stone,

00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:12.889
and saying. ‘I can’t cure, what to do’.
Now, the stone must be removed,

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.023
how can Mataji pull you out?

00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:21.750
See, whatever I may try, there’s a big
stone and that’s pulling you down.

00:24:22.699 --> 00:24:26.843
It’s a very big problem, I think now,

00:24:27.044 --> 00:24:31.932
because Kundalini doesn’t know what to do,
and how to reach your left Vishuddhi,

00:24:32.133 --> 00:24:35.760
to burn out that nonsensical thing which
you have stored very sweetly:

00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:41.306
‘Ah, I’m frightened, I’m afraid,
I’m sorry’.

00:24:41.935 --> 00:24:46.272
In Sahaj Yoga, certain few English language
usages are not allowed –

00:24:46.473 --> 00:24:49.223
one of these ‘I am afraid’.

00:24:49.661 --> 00:24:52.744
Even a politician who is so dominating
will say ‘I’m afraid’.

00:24:52.945 --> 00:24:56.862
I mean, what are you afraid of? Everybody
is afraid of you.

00:24:57.063 --> 00:25:02.871
What is there to be afraid of? So this
usage is not allowed, ‘I’m afraid’.

00:25:03.072 --> 00:25:07.503
This is not allowed at all, to say ‘I’m
afraid’. What are you afraid of?

00:25:07.704 --> 00:25:13.025
As I said today that ‘Wages of sin is
fear’.

00:25:13.251 --> 00:25:16.097
Alright. But wages of sin is fear,

00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:21.064
so, if the sin is removed, then the fear
should go or not?

00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:25.104
But still, it is like this, there is light,

00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:28.935
still you behave as if you, you are
in the dark, still you:

00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:35.165
‘I can’t see, I’m frightened’. Arey Baba,
there is light, see for yourself!

00:25:38.373 --> 00:25:41.698
This is a thing one should know, that your
Kundalini is awakened,

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:45.466
that your Spirit is shining. Open your
heart to this,

00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:48.570
accept this, recognize it,

00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:53.248
know that you are a realized soul now, and
that Kundalini has purified you.

00:25:53.449 --> 00:25:57.151
Now, please do not accumulate this dirt
here, on the left side,

00:25:57.365 --> 00:26:01.340
because you like it, because it’s very
convenient to put up faces,

00:26:01.541 --> 00:26:04.304
to say ‘Oh, it’s alright’.

00:26:04.536 --> 00:26:07.765
Little bit heat coming up, send it up here,
goes like that.

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:12.865
It will be cleaned out. Leave it alone.
Let us face it.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.654
Somebody gets a little heat, ‘Oh, I’m again
bad, again I’m lost,

00:26:18.855 --> 00:26:22.440
God knows what have I done?’

00:26:25.926 --> 00:26:29.264
Correct? It happens, very commonly.

00:26:29.465 --> 00:26:32.804
I find suddenly people...

00:26:36.164 --> 00:26:39.527
without My saying anything. Just imagine!

00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:43.256
“Good morning, good morning!”
”Good morning….”

00:26:44.622 --> 00:26:48.615
“What’s the matter?” “It’s very hot…”.

00:26:50.189 --> 00:26:54.108
Is this the way to greet your Mother?

00:26:55.682 --> 00:26:59.094
You are the soldiers, you are the warriors.

00:26:59.779 --> 00:27:05.680
But, what I find, hands are shaking.
Where should I put these swords?

00:27:09.943 --> 00:27:12.348
This is My experience now,

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:17.360
that this pouch of the left Vishuddhi is
a very difficult thing.

00:27:17.561 --> 00:27:22.158
My ears are also becoming absolutely
clogged with that vibrations,

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:24.657
so much flowing on the left side, all this
left Vishuddhi,

00:27:24.858 --> 00:27:27.592
that I can’t hear from the left side.

00:27:27.816 --> 00:27:32.976
So, at least have some pity on Me, and
give up that nonsense of guilt.

00:27:33.177 --> 00:27:37.343
Even a minute you feel guilty, just look at
outside and look at the birds chirping,

00:27:37.544 --> 00:27:40.433
look at the sunshine, look at the beautiful
Nature

00:27:40.634 --> 00:27:44.255
that has given you such a beautiful color
and all that. Look at that,

00:27:44.456 --> 00:27:47.273
and just take the beauty within yourself
and without.

00:27:47.474 --> 00:27:51.421
Enjoy, and give up this miserable look.

00:27:51.622 --> 00:27:58.673
You should at least look like realized
people. Look, at least, if not feel.

00:28:02.009 --> 00:28:06.494
So, this kind of seriousness has no meaning
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:06.695 --> 00:28:14.443
A Sahaj Yogi stands like this, and talks
like this, and walks like this - normally.

00:28:18.326 --> 00:28:25.817
So, feeling guilty is not only speciality
of English,

00:28:26.018 --> 00:28:28.899
but I have seen it with all the Western
people have this

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.503
very good idea of feeling guilty, everybody
is so.

00:28:34.569 --> 00:28:36.414
Went to France – I told you about French
people.

00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:39.072
As soon as I went there, they warned Me
for one thing,

00:28:39.248 --> 00:28:43.652
that, “Mother, never say You are the happy
person, You are very happy people”.

00:28:43.878 --> 00:28:48.170
I said: ‘Why? Because I’m - I am a happy
person, why should I tell them lies?”.

00:28:48.371 --> 00:28:50.784
Said they will never believe Me, and
they’ll think You are absolutely

00:28:50.985 --> 00:28:54.175
ignorant of the Truth, You are ignorant
of the reality,

00:28:54.376 --> 00:28:57.198
and that You are an uneducated person.

00:28:57.399 --> 00:29:01.850
You have not read books on ‘shocks
for future’ and things like that.

00:29:04.514 --> 00:29:10.131
I said: ‘All right’. But then I really
lashed all the French on that,

00:29:10.307 --> 00:29:13.256
and they laughed and laughed at themselves.

00:29:13.457 --> 00:29:16.694
‘Les Miserables’, I said, ‘you people,
everybody is miserable because of you’.

00:29:16.895 --> 00:29:20.005
Any Frenchman coming anywhere, the people
don’t know where to sit,

00:29:20.206 --> 00:29:23.381
they don’t know this camel, which side
it is going to sit,

00:29:23.582 --> 00:29:27.672
on whose head it is going to sit, and
the camel is very miserable.

00:29:27.873 --> 00:29:31.321
And here everybody is frightened
of the camel, how he is going to behave.

00:29:31.522 --> 00:29:34.435
Very difficult person if he’s French.

00:29:34.636 --> 00:29:38.793
Everywhere internationally they are known
to be difficult.

00:29:38.994 --> 00:29:41.467
And now, here you are, what are you
miserable about?

00:29:41.668 --> 00:29:44.727
And English have taken certain qualities
from Americans,

00:29:44.928 --> 00:29:48.298
which they need not have taken, and some
from French.

00:29:48.499 --> 00:29:52.544
They don’t understand their quality of mind
is the best.

00:29:52.745 --> 00:29:54.801
They have taken from here and there,

00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:58.377
and that’s how they are also becoming
French you see.

00:29:58.578 --> 00:30:02.840
Bathroom culture, that’s what it is.

00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:05.367
And you don’t have to learn anything from
them.

00:30:05.568 --> 00:30:09.321
It is they, they are who have to learn from
you. What have they got?

00:30:09.522 --> 00:30:12.331
Have they got any scholars?

00:30:12.818 --> 00:30:15.001
Very few.

00:30:15.646 --> 00:30:21.533
And you, your this weakness for becoming
miserable, and guilty, and all that,

00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:27.294
is coming from where? I really can’t
understand, what is there to be miserable?

00:30:27.495 --> 00:30:30.574
If you don’t have a job, you get a dole.
Nowhere in the world people get doles.

00:30:30.775 --> 00:30:37.986
Do you know that? Nowhere!
Nowhere people get doles.

00:30:38.187 --> 00:30:42.516
While you get your doles quite all right,
it will mean... you don’t starve.

00:30:42.858 --> 00:30:48.159
Germany, France, anywhere, you don’t get
a good dole.

00:30:50.172 --> 00:30:54.542
So what is there to be miserable? At least
you people be happy people.

00:30:54.743 --> 00:31:00.458
At least the English should show the way.
Feel happy within yourself.

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:04.168
Then only you’ll be able to see the Spirit.

00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:08.432
Don’t be miserable. There’s nothing to be
miserable.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:13.463
We are special people, who have got
the blessings of our Spirit.

00:31:13.664 --> 00:31:20.417
We should all sing, laugh, enjoy, be
[sprinkling? Indistinct] with vitality.

00:31:20.618 --> 00:31:22.626
There’s nothing to feel miserable.

00:31:22.827 --> 00:31:27.580
I mean, after some time you’ll find really
ou’ll have to act to be miserable.

00:31:27.781 --> 00:31:33.057
It will be difficult for you to be miserable
for more than five minutes.

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:37.564
I can bet on that. With Me, same problem.
I find it impossible, you see.

00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:41.160
I try to be very serious: ‘I’m going to
now say something serious’ -

00:31:41.361 --> 00:31:45.532
suddenly I burst out laughing, because
to Me the whole thing is nothing

00:31:45.733 --> 00:31:48.377
but a big joke on.

00:31:48.678 --> 00:31:51.622
So don’t have these French ideas in your
head of becoming miserable

00:31:51.823 --> 00:31:57.643
for nothing at all. Be a happy people. Emit
happiness, joy to others.

00:31:57.844 --> 00:32:03.511
There’s nothing like ‘future shock’,
for you at least.

00:32:03.712 --> 00:32:11.498
There’s nothing like future problems.
Future is beautiful, just you have no idea.

00:32:11.699 --> 00:32:18.240
But do not lag behind with a big stone
tied to your necks.

00:32:19.035 --> 00:32:23.319
For people who know that they have found
the Spirit,

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.135
they should know that they have found
the joy.

00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:32.347
Spirit is the source of joy, and that
should be evident when you talk.

00:32:32.548 --> 00:32:38.179
No inhibitions, no curbing, it’s complete
freedom.

00:32:38.931 --> 00:32:43.951
But do not try to mold yourself into the
molds of the people who are not realized.

00:32:44.152 --> 00:32:48.363
Now you are different, you are changed,
it is irreversible.

00:32:48.564 --> 00:32:50.998
Whatever you may try, say after two years
or three years,

00:32:51.199 --> 00:32:55.601
all of you will be bubbling with laughter.
But why not do it now?

00:32:56.016 --> 00:33:00.196
If it is going to happen later, why not
have the blossom time now?

00:33:00.397 --> 00:33:04.222
We start thinking about it, we start
worrying about it,

00:33:04.423 --> 00:33:07.004
there’s nothing like that.

00:33:07.205 --> 00:33:11.826
Our problems are solved, our lives are
beautified,

00:33:12.027 --> 00:33:16.078
everything is so nice and good, just
to make you happy.

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:20.564
Still if you are not happy, still if you
are worried,

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:25.154
then the Divine recedes, it recedes.

00:33:25.355 --> 00:33:32.684
It’s like sunshine. If you do not want
to face the sunshine, you do not get it.

00:33:32.885 --> 00:33:37.087
You have to face the sunshine. You just
don’t get it.

00:33:37.288 --> 00:33:42.722
Every tree moves to the sunshine, every
leaf tries to be towards the sunshine.

00:33:42.923 --> 00:33:48.592
They have innately built wisdom,
in the same way you should be,

00:33:48.888 --> 00:33:52.553
and you will see that with this – your life
will change completely.

00:33:52.754 --> 00:33:58.382
Every moment you’ll enjoy. Every minute
of life you’ll enjoy.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:04.019
Everything that you do you’ll enjoy. Every
small thing you do you’ll enjoy.

00:34:07.325 --> 00:34:12.461
People are sometimes amazed with Me, also.
Once I climbed up a place called Palitana

00:34:12.662 --> 00:34:17.404
which is about seven miles one has to walk,
with My son-in-law, daughter,

00:34:17.605 --> 00:34:20.252
and they said: ‘If You cannot go up You’d
better sit on those palanquins

00:34:20.522 --> 00:34:23.500
and all that’. ‘No, no’ - I said - ‘I can
walk, let’s go, I’ll walk’.

00:34:23.701 --> 00:34:26.582
And I was just enjoying, you know, I never
felt I was walking on a thing like that,

00:34:26.783 --> 00:34:29.002
because I was enjoying the Nature, I was
enjoying the people,

00:34:29.203 --> 00:34:32.311
how they were coming down, and how
the people were going up and all that,

00:34:32.512 --> 00:34:35.041
and their gaits and things, and I was just
enjoying all that.

00:34:35.203 --> 00:34:38.601
And when we reached there, these people
who were going with Me,

00:34:38.802 --> 00:34:42.191
absolutely fagged out and tired, they sat
down: ‘Haaaa’.

00:34:42.392 --> 00:34:45.945
And I also sat down with them, I looked up,
I said: ‘Look at these –

00:34:46.146 --> 00:34:50.995
so many elephants of - they made, and
everybody’s tail is differently twisted.

00:34:51.196 --> 00:34:54.438
How they must have thought of so many
permutations and combinations?’.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:59.130
My son-in-law said: ‘How could You see
the tail of an elephant

00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:02.473
when we are so very tired here?’.

00:35:02.674 --> 00:35:05.526
You see, I just - spontaneously I saw
the thing,

00:35:05.727 --> 00:35:09.888
I said: ‘How surprising that they have
twisted the tail of the elephants’ –

00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:13.327
there were many elephants created, you
see, at least there must be about

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:16.991
hundred elephants in that pattern,
everybody’s tail was twisted differently.

00:35:17.192 --> 00:35:20.737
I said: ‘It’s so, I mean, imagine, one
hundred elephants with twisted tails

00:35:20.938 --> 00:35:23.821
in different ways, hundred ways. It’s
remarkable for Me’.

00:35:24.022 --> 00:35:29.376
They said: “How could you see the tail?
We are so tired, we want some water!”.

00:35:30.886 --> 00:35:37.007
That’s what it is. This is inexhaustible.
This power of enjoyment is inexhaustible.

00:35:37.208 --> 00:35:42.506
I want you all to enjoy that, to drink that
nectar of your Spirit,

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:46.431
and to forget about all these artificial
problems that you have.

00:35:46.632 --> 00:35:51.534
You just enjoy, because now you are
drenched in your Spirit. So enjoy that.

00:35:51.735 --> 00:35:56.362
Why worry? Some people haven’t got it,
they will get it also.

00:35:56.563 --> 00:35:59.697
Don’t worry about anyone, they will all
get it, they will all have to get it,

00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:04.502
all those who are seekers will have
to come. It’s nice you have come earlier,

00:36:04.703 --> 00:36:10.682
it’s a nice thing, but now do not stop
your progress by

00:36:12.009 --> 00:36:17.333
lingering with this load around your neck.

00:36:17.534 --> 00:36:22.096
Let the Kundalini take you up. But she
likes light things -

00:36:22.297 --> 00:36:25.867
she’s a light thing herself, that’s why
she rises.

00:36:26.068 --> 00:36:28.219
Everything that is heavy within you she’ll
burn,

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.855
but do not make yourself additionally
heavy.

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:34.411
May God Bless you.

00:36:45.607 --> 00:36:49.838
I’ll have some water please. You brought
this gentleman (a statue) here?

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:53.119
You brought him? [Yogi: “Yes, Mother”]
Ah ha.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.506
[Yogi: “Is it the correct place in the
temple…?”] Anywhere, it’s great, you know.

00:36:57.707 --> 00:37:00.138
Some thieves came into our house.

00:37:00.339 --> 00:37:04.368
And this heavy gentleman had come from
India. He was very vibrated.

00:37:04.569 --> 00:37:08.025
And the thieves came with some silver put
in the dining room.

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:12.437
They had collected all the silver, put it
on a tablecloth,

00:37:12.638 --> 00:37:16.043
and put the whole thing on the dining room.

00:37:16.244 --> 00:37:21.956
And then suddenly God knows what happened.
They just ran away, leaving that there.

00:37:22.157 --> 00:37:26.597
And this gentleman was there,
in the passage. They just ran away.

00:37:26.798 --> 00:37:29.952
Can you imagine, these thieves - I mean
they are burglars,

00:37:30.153 --> 00:37:32.400
competent absolutely, experts -

00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:37.818
nobody could believe it, except that we saw
some steps and our door was opened out.

00:37:38.019 --> 00:37:40.789
Otherwise nobody could believe it.
Not here, Oxted.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.443
But they did not take even a spoon.

00:37:46.358 --> 00:37:49.209
God knows what happened.

00:37:57.081 --> 00:37:59.920
I was not there.

00:38:02.293 --> 00:38:06.427
Recently brought from India. You see,
poor - were very hefty people

00:38:06.628 --> 00:38:12.758
who brought our luggage - do, leave it
there - and they brought this one.

00:38:12.959 --> 00:38:16.172
She said: “This is a very heavy gentleman
from India”.

00:38:16.373 --> 00:38:21.958
They were both hot and exhausted, but
their Kundalini had risen up.

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:24.816
This is Kartikeya.

00:38:27.556 --> 00:38:32.167
Hmmm! This is the fire of Christ.

00:38:32.693 --> 00:38:36.502
This is the one that is going to come.
Really. The fire of Christ.

00:38:36.703 --> 00:38:43.118
The destroying power, Rudras. This is one
of the Rudras of Christ.

00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:52.333
Hmm, it’s quite warm, I think.

00:39:02.811 --> 00:39:07.780
Kundalini is working it out. She is rising.

00:39:17.405 --> 00:39:23.198
How are you here? [Somebody says: “Fine”]
Alright? Alison? Hm.

00:39:23.399 --> 00:39:26.410
Come, come.

00:39:26.611 --> 00:39:30.642
I would like to see all the children
on My feet today.
