1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,750
I asked some of the boys, “What is your
policy?”

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,200
They said, “We have no policy."

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,530
“Then what is your aim?”

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,130
“We have no aim."

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,260
“Then why are you doing this nonsense?”

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,589
They said, “Because whatever the elders
tell us, we do it."

7
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:21,519
I said, “Have you no personality?

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,519
Nothing?”

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:29,960
Is exactly what happened when this hippy movement
started.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,280
Some so-called intellectuals started this
horrible hippy movement in the West.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,720
And when they found they cannot do anything
about it, they found it’s going to fail,

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,090
so many children lost their education, so
many children I know became pregnant, girls

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:56,070
and boys [sadist scout/squat].

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,340
All that took them to the extreme that they
became violent.

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:08,700
But unless and until there is a change within
yourself, how can we change anything outside?

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,660
We cannot.

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:16,910
And the first seven people I fought were all
hippies.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,750
Very difficult.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,340
They called themselves hippies but they used
to hog like a pig.

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:33,500
They wanted all the comforts, everything free,
extremely dominating and quarrelsome people.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,090
But the foundation was laid on them.

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,270
Very surprising.

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:45,050
But I had to work on them for at least four
years regularly.

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:56,650
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started, and today
you know how much it has spread, how far it

25
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,780
has gone.

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,740
Only in Maharashtra this problem is there
of so-called intellectuals, this is called

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,990
themselves, but they have no intelligence.

28
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,700
I talked to one man; I got fed up.

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,090
He didn’t know anything about spirituality,
he didn’t know anything about medicine,

30
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,620
he didn’t know anything about science.

31
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,800
I said, “Now, what do you know?”

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,760
So it was impossible.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,615
So such people who are jobless ? we call them
[nikaam bekaar] ? they have no work, they

34
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:31,520
are starting all such things and we should
not be upset with them.

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,600
They are trying to create problems and they
are getting money from some sources.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,840
They are afraid, I think the politicians are
afraid, perhaps, that Sahaja Yoga may turn

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,390
their tables down because we believe in honesty,
and maybe a day may come when these honest

38
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,240
people might harm them, perhaps.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,460
I do not know why.

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,350
This may be one of the reasons these people
are frightened of us.

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:16,650
Or whatever it is we have to understand that
for doing any great work one has to sacrifice.

42
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,290
Of course, you are not going to be crucified
like Christ, no.

43
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,500
Nor you have to sacrifice as my parents sacrificed
for the independence of this country.

44
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,349
Nor you are going to be tortured.

45
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,350
But really, inconveniences you may have.

46
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,620
But I must thank you very much because of
you are coming here and singing Marathi songs.

47
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,080
They are quite impressed and they think it’s
only possible because you are all Sahaja yogis.

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,180
Otherwise you could not have done.

49
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,250
So if there are any inconveniences think that
it’s a joke; that’s all.

50
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:06,690
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja
of Shri chakra and Lalita chakra which we

51
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,740
have never done.

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:16,769
This is the right place to do these two chakras
today.

53
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:26,449
Lot has been written about Shri chakra and
about Lalita chakra, but to understand fundamentally

54
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:40,129
the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,
then it uses on the right side the Shri chakra,

55
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:48,659
on the left side the Lalita chakra, to manifest
itself.

56
00:04:48,659 --> 00:05:01,559
These two chakras are the ones who manifest
all that you see.

57
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:15,210
But these chakras are the ones who emit vibrations
of different kinds, and because of their angularities,

58
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,919
like if you have some sort of a cardboard
attached with small, small holes of different

59
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,349
colors and which rotates all the time, you
get different colors.

60
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:31,479
Also you can get different permutations and
combinations.

61
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:40,650
In the same way, different permutations and
combinations are created, and that is how

62
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,979
you get all the advantages of Sahaja Yoga.

63
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,029
So these two chakras are very important.

64
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:56,110
I do not know if you know of any mantras about
Shri chakra but I’ll give you a book, later

65
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,229
on I’ll translate it to you and you can
compose something for Shri chakra.

66
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:08,869
Shri chakra on the right side, Lalita chakra
on the left side, so what we are really worshipping

67
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:15,960
today is Mahasaraswati power and Mahakali
power, both put together.

68
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,309
So now we started combining things, not individual.

69
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:26,210
Now, these two energies are very important.

70
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,129
Without the energy, without the power, nothing
exists.

71
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:43,710
For example, if this light had no power to
give light or to burn, it is useless.

72
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:53,220
In the same way, without getting your realization
you are useless because your power is not

73
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,499
awakened, at least not complete.

74
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:13,389
But these two powers give us lots of benefits
even without realization.

75
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:23,240
Whatever you see in this world created is
done by these two chakras of the Adi Shakti.

76
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,150
But here the power doesn’t move.

77
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,910
It’s not moving.

78
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,439
But in the human being the power start moving.

79
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:47,969
And when it starts moving, then we can say
it is creating another world.

80
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,889
But movement is not the only thing.

81
00:07:51,889 --> 00:08:00,530
This power acts, gives you intelligence, gives
you all kinds of things which you have as

82
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,499
human beings.

83
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:11,869
But later on this power itself becomes enlightened
within you when the left and right side both

84
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:14,389
become enlightened.

85
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:23,899
This enlightenment, you get it when you get
your Self-realization, but not immediately,

86
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:24,899
not immediately.

87
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:27,490
This, one should understand.

88
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:39,000
For example, if you have pain or if your chakra
is catching, you have to use your hands.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,860
You cannot say that, “The energy is flowing
within me.

90
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
So it’s all right.

91
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,050
I can manage."

92
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,870
It’s not like that.

93
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:54,410
You have to use your hands to impart that
power to yourself or to others.

94
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,470
If you have pain in the stomach then you can
say that, “If there’s energy in my stomach

95
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,610
why should I have pain in the stomach?”

96
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,750
But the play of these chakras have to come.

97
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:20,920
And that is why you have to use your power
of your hands.

98
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:31,300
If you cannot use your hands then you cannot
impart this energy.

99
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:39,769
Many people have asked Me that, “Mother,
when will it move horizontal?”

100
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,209
It will move horizontal, no doubt.

101
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,920
It does.

102
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:54,790
But even that horizontal movement is to be
guided by these two very important chakras.

103
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,990
So you must understand the importance of these
two chakras within yourself.

104
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,819
That’s why I have told many a times, “Don’t
move your head too many times."

105
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:11,430
And this way many people talk, I mean, it’s
style of talking, “No, this, that,” very

106
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,800
common with French, specially.

107
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,100
That’s another way you are not respecting
your chakras.

108
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,740
Shouldn’t move your shoulders too much.

109
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,500
Mostly they talk like this.

110
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,430
It’s anti-chakras, anti-chakras.

111
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,000
Should keep your shoulders straight.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:42,230
When you are singing you can move your whole
upper part ? it’s all right ? but not your

113
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,230
shoulders.

114
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:53,310
This is the thing one has to understand that
these two centers are to be looked after.

115
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,500
You can move your neck, your body, when you
are singing.

116
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:05,589
It’s important, that helps, but not your
shoulders.

117
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,600
Shoulders are to be kept intact.

118
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,990
But while saying just, “Yes,” you need
not go on, “Yes, yes, yes, yes."

119
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,940
It’s a very, very simple thing that it can
have a very bad effect.

120
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,329
And those who move their shoulders too much
do not feel vibrations much because the chakras

121
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,160
are not all right.

122
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:38,190
It’s a very simple thing to be understood
that they are the most important chakras we

123
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:46,720
have, and whatever is to be used out of this
Paramachaitanya they have to be used by these

124
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,269
two centers.

125
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,480
Even supposing your some chakra is catching
on your spinal chord, you have to use your

126
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,260
hands.

127
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,580
Somebody can say, “I can just put my attention."

128
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,149
Doesn’t work out that good.

129
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:12,279
Because yet your attention has not that reached
that stage where these chakras, like Lalita

130
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,550
chakra and Shri chakra, obey your attention.

131
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,439
They do not.

132
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:25,930
So you have to work out with your hands.

133
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,180
Be careful: don’t move your shoulders too
much.

134
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,029
And if you see now Indians when they sing
bhajans they’ll move their whole body, they’ll

135
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,670
do like this, but never their shoulders.

136
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,250
The shoulders will move in the same way as
the neck is moving.

137
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:51,120
They might move their neck also but they’ll
never move their shoulders like this, and

138
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,889
it’s regarded as inauspicious according
to Indian standards.

139
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:03,459
Because of this culture based on what the
saints have told and also about many seers

140
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:11,480
have told, it is more related to spiritual
life than to materialistic life.

141
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,649
Now the materialistic life, unless and until
there is the foundation of the spiritual life,

142
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:24,060
takes you to a very partial development, you
can say.

143
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:33,569
But to get a full development you must have
your foundation on spirituality.

144
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:42,110
That’s why spirituality being the foundation
has to be deep, has to be fully equipped,

145
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,110
has to be absolutely perfect.

146
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,949
Then the whole building can be built.

147
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,740
It’s gone wrong in the West; doesn’t matter.

148
00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:03,360
Now you can build it up and then you’ll
be surprised how you become really solid people.

149
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,629
This is a very short talk about Shri chakra.

150
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:14,779
I think I should sit down and write all about
it and it would be nice handing it for you

151
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,879
to read.

152
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:29,939
But you must know that beyond thought, when
you go, these chakras become extremely efficient

153
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:37,509
because the thought puts a pressure on them,
and because of the pressure the movement of

154
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:42,300
these chakras is very slow and ineffective.

155
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,560
But once you can get out of your thoughts
and go into thoughtless awareness, then these

156
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,269
chakras start working it out and you start
moving much deeper into your own being.

157
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,220
[The lecture continues in Hindi but becomes
inaudible after some time]

158
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,560
I must say that this beautiful Earth has created
so many beautiful things.

159
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:07,320
But She Herself is nothing but detached, simple
Mother Earth.

160
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,470
Perhaps that’s My condition, too.

161
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:17,779
When it comes to creation I can create beautiful
things.

162
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,950
You are so beautiful, too, creatures.

163
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:30,589
But as far as I am concerned I do not think
that I require any one of these things or

164
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:36,800
I’m bothered about them, or need them or
tempted by them.

165
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,800
So what Grégoire has said is because they
are insisting that they are going to give

166
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,449
Me presents every year and that’s why this
is a delude to them.

167
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:49,170
But I’ve been telling them that there’s
no need now.

168
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,529
Let’s say, you all consider it, is only
no need to give so many presents.

169
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,740
What you can do now to start reducing the
number of presents you give Me.

170
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,519
One country can give one present.

171
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,420
If you can do that I’ll be thankful, but
I’ll have to build another house.

172
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:19,339
And the grandeur and all these things are
created by Me but never enjoyed by Me.

173
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:21,899
I just enjoy Myself; that’s all.

174
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:28,199
And Myself is so big, it is such a big thing,
that I don’t know what it means; it means

175
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,670
grandeur, or nature, or anything, or you all
people.

176
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,160
I enjoy everything of it.

177
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,269
So for Me there’s no need for you to.

178
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:45,709
Now as he said that those people came, three
of them ? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha ? to give

179
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,300
presents to Christ.

180
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,180
Yes, they did.

181
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,509
And you have given Me, too.

182
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:58,130
But now I think it’s better that you people
reduce some quantity at least.

183
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:03,769
I’ll be very thankful that if something
could be done like that, and from next year

184
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:08,200
we should try to make it less and less and
less.

185
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:15,050
Because it’s very sweet of you to have given
Me all those things, because I enjoyed them,

186
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:21,200
they are beautiful things, and when I see
them I remember your good heart.

187
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,670
But you know that Mother is too simple and
though I can create all kinds of things, as

188
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,850
far as I am concerned I am too simple.

189
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,850
And also Mr.

190
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,080
Shrivastava so many times, says also, “You’ve
got so many saris but you’ll go on with

191
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,550
Your white sari all the time."

192
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:51,300
The reason is, you see, a simple personality
can only create beautiful things.

193
00:17:51,300 --> 00:18:02,210
A simple heart can only create nice things,
because simplicity at the simple level is

194
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,600
so simple.

195
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,380
Like you are made of seven chakras, seven
chakras, then the permutations of these seven

196
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,790
chakras, that’s all.

197
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,250
But supposing you start from outside then
you’ll have to go to medical science or

198
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,020
you’ll have to go to another complicated
thing.

199
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,050
But basically, fundamentally, it’s too simple.

200
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:28,490
That’s why Sahaja Yoga is very simple, because
we are dealing with the fundamental things.

201
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,390
So fundamentally, if you are simple then everything
that you do is just a combination and permutation

202
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:42,050
of all these things, and all these things
when they are put together they make such

203
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,050
beautiful things.

204
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,640
For example, as I have told you once I was
travelling and we went to a place called Palitana

205
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,250
known to be a very beautiful, beautifully
carved place.

206
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,460
And we had to walk, I don’t know, for three
miles at least, climbing up or something like

207
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
that.

208
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,930
With Me was My daughter and My son-in-law.

209
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,050
Went up and there was a little temple.

210
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,810
They wanted to rest.

211
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,880
And also we laid down ourselves there.

212
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,460
And as soon as I saw all these beautiful elephants
were there, so I told My son-in-law, “Look

213
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,690
at these elephants.

214
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,150
All their tails are twisted differently."

215
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,300
He said, “Mummy, we are so fed up.

216
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,240
How do you have energy to see the tails?”

217
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,080
I said, “Because I see the tails I don’t
feel tired.

218
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,540
That’s the point.

219
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,160
Because I see the beauty of these tails, I
— ”.

220
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,030
So you see, even in simple things there is
so much of beauty.

221
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:50,750
In very, very ordinary persons you’ll find
that they have a very beautiful things and

222
00:19:50,750 --> 00:20:01,930
very nice way of saying things, very simple
talks of children like that, it’s so simple,

223
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,120
so straightforward, and whatever they say
it’s so deep.

224
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:12,210
So whatever is deep is simple, but when it
is expressed outside it can have lots of permutations

225
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,660
and combinations and it can work out in a
beautiful way.

226
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,700
I must tell you, I had no strain in making
this house, nothing.

227
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,741
I was not bothered at all.

228
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:30,030
I found everything so easily; I brought it
here, put it down here, I never even thought

229
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,030
there’s strain or anything.

230
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,030
Everybody says, “What a concept."

231
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,390
But I never conceived anything.

232
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,210
I mean, I just don’t know.

233
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,430
What is a concept is there; I just told, “To
Me is nothing great."

234
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,370
The whole world is there for us to see and
to be fascinated.

235
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:52,960
But behind all that, all this world and everything
is created with the very little, simple idea

236
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,380
of God, that you all have to enter into the
Kingdom of God.

237
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,070
That’s all; such a simple idea.

238
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:09,110
So He’s created such a beautiful world,
then he created all kinds of things to bring

239
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:15,530
you to the human level, and now just simple
thing is to enter into the Kingdom of God.

240
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,550
You should not complicate yourself too much
and once you do that you will be surprised

241
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,200
how beautifully you will be able to produce.

242
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,310
Even some artists were extremely simple by
nature.

243
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:36,010
Like Ravi Shankar, you know, and his guru,
he has got Alla Raka and Ali Akbar; all these

244
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,210
were his disciples.

245
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,824
Such a great genius man, such a simple man,
I tell you.

246
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:41,180
And he knew Me very well.

247
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,890
He used to call Me “Ma”; he used to call
Me “Mother” from the very beginning.

248
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:57,470
And one day he brought one little deer, a
baby deer, brought it to Me.

249
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,300
I said, “What’s the matter?”

250
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,140
He said, “See, this deer was crying too
much.

251
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,270
So I brought it to You."

252
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,350
But I said, “For, why for Me?”

253
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,340
“So, You see, he will feel the love of his
Mother.

254
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,160
So You just caress him."

255
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,940
Imagine, such a great artist coming like a
little baby to Me, making that.

256
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,750
I was so surprised at him.

257
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,050
Look at him; such a simple man.

258
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,850
He’s doing that.

259
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,690
And you see, if you see the children when
they love, how genuine they are, how they

260
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,690
work it out.

261
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,840
The same place there was a child.

262
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,720
He was very fond of Me.

263
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:43,420
And one day he decided to bring some pumpkins
for Me.

264
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,050
So he brought one to Me.

265
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,660
I saw him bringing in the thing.

266
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,510
He said, “All right, just wait."

267
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,190
Then there was, he went back, and there was
another one kept little further.

268
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,590
He brought that.

269
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,710
He had put nine of them in different places.

270
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,900
One by one he was bringing them.

271
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,340
He brought nine pumpkins to give Me.

272
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
So sweet.

273
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,980
But I said, “Why did you bring nine?”

274
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,470
“Because I don’t know which one you like
so I brought all of them."

275
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,770
So simple and so touching; I mean, just [touch/touches/tears/turns]
your heart.

276
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,530
So we have to be simple people.

277
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:26,030
We have to talk to each other in a simple
way, not in a complicated way, in a very simple,

278
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,120
sweet manner.

279
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,600
That’s how we are going to create a beautiful
world.

280
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,750
So I would request all of you to be very kindly
and very gentle with each other, especially

281
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,130
for the newly marrying couples.

282
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,280
Try to be nice.

283
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,150
Nobody is going to dominate you if you are
nice.

284
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,760
It’s only you dominate yourself.

285
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,540
And don’t try to control your husbands or
your wives.

286
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Let them be.

287
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,530
Let them enjoy their freedom.

288
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,390
They are not going to do anything wrong.

289
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,870
So some people try to control too much and
there are problems.

290
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,610
So please do not try to control like, “If
I am keeping it here, they’ll keep it there."

291
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,750
There’s no need.

292
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,750
Let it be.

293
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,370
Doesn’t matter; nothing so serious.

294
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,840
But on small, small things, I’ve seen, such
marriages fizzle out.

295
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,470
And it is absolutely wrong.

296
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,110
So for marriages today, it’s a very auspicious
day.

297
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,670
So many people have been engaged to be married.

298
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:30,660
But one thing you must remember, that you
should not lose your connection with joy.

299
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,840
It’s stupidity.

300
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,660
When two nice birds are together they should
chirp and laugh and enjoy.

301
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:43,790
Instead of that, if they start pricking each
other, what should we call them?

302
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,890
So today it’s a great joy for Me.

303
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,110
So many people are engaged and are going to
get married.

304
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,460
But now, understand your responsibility that
nothing is to be done.

305
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,060
You have to be just sahaj; don’t have to
do anything.

306
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,310
“We are working out."

307
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,200
You cannot work out marriage; you cannot work
out.

308
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,470
Just know about your husband or about your
wife and just try to enjoy whatever they are.

309
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:15,100
I mean, I do enjoy that way about My husband,
so many things which may sound little queer

310
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,290
to people, but I enjoy it.

311
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:20,720
Because I know that’s a nice thing about
our human beings that they have varieties

312
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,600
and they have little, different angles to
themselves.

313
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,340
And these angles are to be enjoyed and to
be appreciated.

314
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,030
If you can do that, then you will never fight.

315
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,450
Because two persons cannot be alike; even
two leaves are not alike.

316
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,240
So you should enjoy.

317
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,400
Everybody has some sort of a super quality
thing or whatever it is or maybe some angle.

318
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,240
Just enjoy that angle.

319
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,710
You don’t have that; so let him have at
least, or let her have that.

320
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,950
So today, special day is that so many marriages
have been fixed out.

321
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,220
I don’t know how many ? he has not told
Me yet the number ? but quite a lot have been

322
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
fixed.

323
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Sahaja yogi: Fifty.

324
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,360
Shri Mataji: Fifty have been already fixed.

325
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
All right.

326
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,360
So now it’s a very big number and will be
more by the time we reach Ganapatipule.

327
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,110
So let us not create problems out of this.

328
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,150
You don’t have to sit down.

329
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,920
I have seen after marriage they start thinking,
“What, what do you think about him?”

330
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,220
It’s like after realization you start thinking.

331
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,420
Once you are married, you are not to think
then accept.

332
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,460
Before marriage you think.

333
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,510
What’s the use of thinking after marriage?

334
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:32,650
It’s a very common thing.

335
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,980
After marriage they start thinking.

336
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,060
Then, after marriage you enjoy.

337
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,290
After cooking the food you eat the food.

338
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:42,750
Or after the food has been served then you
start thinking about it.

339
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,750
It’s absurd.

340
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,680
So this is a very common failing we have had
so far.

341
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,840
I would like to tell you first of all, you
think before getting married and after getting

342
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,620
married you carry on.

343
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,740
And don’t try to control.

344
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,900
Don’t try to dictate.

345
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,600
Try to be nice and sweet.

346
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,230
You don’t have to go out of the way, but
be normal and it will all work out.

347
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,710
May God bless you all, specially all the girls
and boys who have been engaged.

348
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,960
I bless you from My heart, and enjoy each
other; that’s the main point.

349
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,530
So thank you very much.

350
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:16,540
Thank you.
